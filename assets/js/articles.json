      "Marcus Rashford has shown his true colours following Barcelona's 3-1 win over Elche. The Manchester United loanee, who joined the Catalan giants on loan in the summer, fired Hansi Flick's side to victory at the Estadi Olímpic Lluís Companys on Sunday evening.",
      "Lamine Yamal opened the scoring within the first few minutes, bending the ball into the top left corner from close range. Ferran Torres doubled Barcelona's advantage a few moments later, finishing off a lovely move orchestrated by Fermin Lopez.",
      "Rafa Mir clawed one back for the visitors just before the break, though Rashford sealed the deal with the decisive third goal in the second half. Instead of shifting onto his favoured right foot, the United loanee surged towards the touchline before unleashing a thunderous effort with his left.",
      "Rashford's strike cannoned off the underside of the crossbar to secure the reigning La Liga champions all three points. The England international, who has been outstanding for Barcelona this season, has now scored six times and contributed seven assists across all competitions.",
      "Speaking to Spanish publication Mundo Deportivo after the match, Rashford reflected on his display. The 28-year-old said: \"I try to give my best. I could have done better against Elche, and I promise to improve because I'm not entirely happy with my performance overall.\"",
      "Rashford added: \"We work hard to win. We're taking it one game at a time. We need to keep playing as a team. This is Barca, and the demands must always be at their highest.\"",
      "Meanwhile, Torres said: \"Perhaps we haven't been as accurate in some plays as we should have been. We've found the spirit and the intensity. I think we're finding the Barca of last season, when we devoured the pitch from the start.",
      "\"We needed to recover the joy of playing,\" added the former Manchester City forward. \"We saw during the week that they were going to play a man-to-man game, and we prepared for that. We were coming off a defeat, and we needed to win here, in our stadium and in front of our fans.\"",
      "Discussing his strike, which turned out to be his 50th for the club, Torres said: \"I'm very happy to have scored. I try to help the team. I didn't know that, but I'm very happy. Many more goals will come!\"",
      "Fanatics has slashed up to 60% off football kits and merch. Until Sunday, fans can find discounts on products from Premier League clubs including Man United, Man City, Liverpool, Everton, Arsenal, Spurs and more.",
      "The Spain international devoted his effort to those affected by the floods in Valencia last year. Torres said: \"It's been a difficult week, and we can't forget the people affected in Valencia, so I wanted to send them a message of solidarity and support through this goal.\"",
      "Should Barcelona choose not to trigger the option-to-buy clause, which is reportedly £28m, and Rashford heads back to United, Bryan Robson reckons the forward will need to change his attitude.",
      "Speaking to Grosvenor Casinos, the Reds legend said: \"Marcus is a great talent and everything, but I do think his attitude's got to change if he does come back to United.",
      "\"Marcus is a great talent and everything, but I do think his attitude's got to change if he does come back to United. Barcelona is different because we always know that Barcelona and Real Madrid are going to be dominant in their league.",
      "\"So for a player like Marcus playing with the top players like Barcelona have, he will improve and he will start enjoying his football a little bit better if he were to come back to United.",
      "\"I can't believe that people say that he's enjoying the two clubs that he left us for, and that you can't enjoy your football at Man United. That seems crazy to me.\"",

      "Former Premier League referee Keith Hackett has declared that Manchester United were lucky to escape without conceding a late penalty during Saturday's 2-2 stalemate with Nottingham Forest. Ruben Amorim's side maintained their unbeaten streak after fighting back from a deficit to secure a point at the City Ground.",
      "Following Casemiro's opener in the first half, Forest took the lead through Morgan Gibbs-White and Nicolo Savona before Amad's 81st-minute effort restored parity. With the scoreline at 2-1 and United desperately seeking an equaliser, Forest supporters were left incensed when referee Darren England chose not to award them a spot-kick.",
      "Ryan Yates' header from a corner inadvertently struck Amad's arm after he misjudged his leap whilst attempting to clear. Despite furious appeals from fans and players alike, England refused to point to the spot and United subsequently found their leveller.",
      "The Premier League Match Centre account on X failed to clarify why the video assistant referee (VAR) chose not to intervene. Nevertheless, Hackett has maintained the decision was incorrect, describing the incident as a \"clear handball offence\" in a post on X.",
      "It marked the second contentious ruling that went against Forest after Sean Dyche was left livid with how United's opening goal materialised. The Forest manager was incensed that a corner was awarded in the build-up to Casemiro's strike. Savona appeared to have maintained possession but the linesman on the far side signalled for a corner.",
      "\"I just can't understand it, you're an assistant referee and 70-odd yards away, you've got a goal and a net in the way, but apparently you can see,\" Dyche said. \"I've got a better view and I'm not in the right position.",
      "\"That's got to be wrong in the current climate. I'm a big fan of VAR. Someone has got to be able to overrule these decisions, just really quickly, [it would take] only five seconds.",
      "\"For me, that's five seconds of VAR: 'Bang, that's it, done, wrong decision.' It is really, really frustrating two weeks on the trot. With all the technology and all that's at stake, particularly for us at Nottingham Forest after the start the club has had, that's a big moment.",
      "\"We all want it right, every fan wants it right. The worst thing, I'm back in the game for three games and for two weeks on the trot I'm talking about refereeing decisions. I want to be talking about my team.\"",

      "Erik ten Hag and Ole Gunnar Solskjaer have both been linked with Wolverhampton Wanderers following the sacking of Vitor Pereira. Pereira was given his marching orders on Sunday after a disappointing 3-0 defeat to Fulham.",
      "Erik ten Hag, who was sacked by Bayer Leverkusen in September, had a short-lived and challenging stint in the Bundesliga, managing just three matches – the fewest number of top-flight matches in charge before being sacked in German league history. The Dutchman held the reins at Manchester United for over two years, overseeing 128 matches and leading the Red Devils to FA Cup and Carabao Cup glory during his tenure.",
      "Solskjaer is another name linked with the vacant post. The former United boss also recently lost his job having been sacked by Besiktas earlier this season after failing to qualify for Europe.",
      "Solskjaer was in charge at United for nearly three years, coming closest to lifting a trophy in 2021 when his team were defeated by Villarreal in a thrilling Europa League final penalty shootout. The managers had varying degrees of success at Old Trafford, and despite the Norwegian managing 40 more matches than his counterpart, their win percentages are strikingly similar.",
      "Fanatics has slashed up to 60% off football kits and merch. Until Sunday, fans can find discounts on products from Premier League clubs including Man United, Man City, Liverpool, Everton, Arsenal, Spurs and more.",
      "It is 54.69 per cent for Ten Hag and 54.17 per cent for Solskjaer. According to Bet365, Brendan Rodgers, Lee Carsley, and Gary O'Neil are also in the running for the Wolves job, along with a few others. The new manager will have their work cut out for them.",
      "With the three newly promoted teams showing strong performances, Wolves are without their usual safety net in the relegation battle. The club are eight points adrift of safety, with Burnley sitting in 17th place on 10 points, leaving a mountain to climb for the incoming boss.",
      "If Ten Hag or Solskjaer take charge at Wolves, it won't be long before they reunite with their former colleagues at United. The Red Devils are currently set to play the Black Country outfit twice in the Premier League next month; firstly at Molineux on December 8, and secondly at Old Trafford on December 30.",
      "In the meantime, though, James Collins and Richard Walker, the head coaches of Wolves' under-21 and under-18 teams, respectively, will take the reins. They will take training while the club searches for a new boss. An official club statement announced that all eight of Pereira's backroom staff left.",

      "Marcus Rashford's Premier League debut is a familiar story - coming just three days after his maiden senior outing for Manchester United. Yet the tale of another academy product who also debuted that afternoon remains largely untold.",
      "Whilst Louis van Gaal handed a second opportunity to young Rashford, who had featured in a Europa League clash against FC Midtjylland 72 hours prior, James Weir was battling his own anxiety. United held a 3-2 advantage over Arsenal, courtesy of a Rashford brace - taking his tally to four goals in fewer than 150 senior minutes for the club - when Van Gaal turned to his substitutes.",
      "Despite having alternative choices available, Van Gaal opted for midfielder Weir. Ander Herrera, carrying a booking and having found the net, made way for Weir, signalling his debut and sole outing for the senior squad.",
      "His stint with the Red Devils proved brief, departing for Hull merely six months afterwards, where he battled fitness problems and endured limited opportunities. Though he skippered the Under-21s at Carrington to league glory, he never earned another chance at elite level, sitting out Hull's entire campaign before their demotion.",
      "At just 28, he hung up his boots following spells at Wigan and Bolton, plus overseas adventures with MTK Budapest, FC ViOn, and Pohronie. Weir continues to remember the campaign when he featured in first-team action at United. \"I was on the bench for about 10 games,\" he told the Guardian.",
      "\"It was a bit of a whirlwind – it feels like a lifetime ago. My debut was an out‐of-body experience but they were the best moments of my career. Being in the squad and exposed to a club that size was incredible. I wouldn't change that minute for anything.\"",
      "In a previous interview with Planet Football, he expanded on his fleeting appearance. \"Usually, you start warming up after 25 minutes or go for a little run to get the manager's attention, but it was different with Van Gaal,\" he said.",
      "\"You had to wait until he told you to warm up, which meant he was then likely to send you on. After about 75 or 80 minutes he told me to warm up and then someone shouted down the touchline to me to come back to the technical area. I was thinking, 'Bloody hell, I am going to come on here'.",
      "\"My parents were there, but the whole thing was so quick. The adrenaline saw me through and I can't remember much about it, apart from standing with Timothy Fosu-Mensah and Paddy McNair at the final whistle, trying to take it all in.\"",
      "The footballer, who had a brief but unforgettable stint with Manchester United in the Premier League, shared his experience with a blend of pride and humour. He said: \"I can tell my children and grandchildren that I played for Manchester United in the Premier League – although I may not mention the one-minute bit!\"",
      "\"I came on for Herrera and he came up to me and said 'fight!' It was typical of him. I remember that clearly. In terms of the coaches, I think it was more just 'don't mess up'.",
      "\"Ander was a good guy. He was all emotion and passion, there was no holding back.\"",
      "He also didn't miss out on the bizarre atmosphere during manager Louis van Gaal's antics, as he recalled: \"It was a crazy day, Van Gaal did that impression of Alexis Sanchez on the touchline [when he fell to the ground]. I was warming up at the time, I thought a fight was going on or something, I only saw it afterwards.\"",
      "On the topic of fellow Red Rashford, he revealed his personal bond with the striker and witnessed his remarkable ascent: \"For Marcus to score twice was surreal really. It made the day even more special.",
      "\"I was a bit older than him, but we were in the same digs together for a couple of years. We used to play FIFA together and go out for food, but I didn't play with him too much as I was a bit older than him.",
      "\"When he got to the reserves we had a couple of games, but he was straight through to the first team really. He missed that period because we had no strikers at the time, he went on to take his chance and the rest is history. We all knew he was the top one in his age group and that he was always destined to reach pretty good heights.\"",
      "Weir's academy side boasted a wealth of promising talent, featuring players such as Pereira, Will Keane, Tyler Blackett, and Dean Henderson. He also shared the turf with established stars including Wayne Rooney, Michael Carrick, Scott McTominay, Jesse Lingard and Antonio Valencia during his time at Old Trafford.",
      "Nevertheless, Weir has now decided to retire from football and embark on a fresh chapter as a travel agent. Speaking to The Guardian, he revealed: \"I can still play football at some level but playing at a professional level day in and day out, my body didn't have that. It was not worth the sacrifice of living away anymore. I thought I needed to cut the cord early and move on to something else.\"",

      "Roy Keane claims he is a surprisingly relaxed dad when it comes to his daughters dating. The Manchester United legend was a renowned hard man during his pomp in the Premier League, which cultivated a somewhat fearsome image.",
      "Keane, 54, has largely kept his private life away from the public eye over the years, though it is known that he married his wife, Theresa Doyle, during his playing days in 1997.",
      "The couple have five children together - four of whom are daughters. Shannon, Caragh, Aidan, Leah and Alanna are now all grown adults.",
      "Keane was asked what it was like to have so many women in his house during an appearance on The Tommy Tiernan Show back in 2023. He responded with “brilliant” in his usual blunt manner, which sparked laughter from the audience.",
      "He added: \"No, it is, brilliant. Really good kids, they're good, very good kids.\" Tiernan then asked him to explain the most difficult aspect of being a dad, which he struggled to answer before screwing his face up.",
      "The host jokingly interjected: \"Are you f***ing kidding me are ya?\" Keane shook his head and responded: \"No, they're ok. Listen when they get a bit older, I suppose boyfriends and that type of carry on, yeah that can be (shrugs).\"",
      "Tiernan, given Keane’s public image, joked: \"I'd say it'd be fairly intimidating meeting you now in all fairness. Clint Eastwood in the kitchen.\"",
      "Yet the former midfielder played it down and insisted he wouldn't be bothered, much to the fascination of the audience watching live in the studio. \"You'd be very surprised. Surely that's the same for everybody,\" he said.",
      "But Tiernan wasn't convinced, saying: \"You're so guarded. Maybe you're just so calm and settled and strong.\" Keane, standing his ground, said: \"No, quite relaxed yeah. Do you want me to do a somersault or something? Very relaxed, nice drive up, we're good.\"",
      "Keane’s eldest daughter Shannon, 31, keeps a low profile and it is unknown whether she currently has a partner. The same goes for his youngest daughter, Alanna, who is very much inactive on her public social media pages.",
      "However, one of his other daughters, Leah, is known to be engaged to Southampton star Taylor Harwood-Bellis. The 23-year-old defender made headlines by popping the question to Leah last year on a chartered yacht cruising around the Amalfi Coast, before scoring on his England debut against Keane’s Republic of Ireland.",
      "The couple announced on social media in August that she is now pregnant, with Leah writing above the post: “Half of me, half of you.” The baby is set to be Keane’s fourth grandchild.",
      "And there was more good news in the Keane family recently as the pundit’s only and rarely-seen son, Aidan, tied the knot with his long-term partner, surrounded by family and friends, in October. Roy posted a picture on social media with the happy couple along with the caption: “Beautiful day celebrating my son and his wife.”",
      "Aidan's sister Caragh also took to social media to share pictures of the happy couple, writing: \"The most perfect weekend celebrating my brother and my beautiful new sister.\" She posted a photo of the bridesmaids seeing the bride's wedding dress for the first time, as well as a snap of the newlyweds leaving the church after the ceremony.",
      "There is no confirmed public information about Caragh, 29, herself having a partner, though she has spoken openly about her personal health journey. Caragh was diagnosed with lupus in 2021, a condition that causes the body’s immune system to mistakenly attack healthy tissue, causing blistered skin, severe joint pain and hair loss.",
      "The seriousness of her illness meant Caragh, who was working as a teacher in Manchester at the time, had no choice but to leave her job. However, she has since made an impressive recovery and launched her own gut-friendly cereal brand, Superkeen, which is now thriving, much to the delight of her famous father.",

      "Manchester United managed to maintain their four-game unbeaten streak against Nottingham Forest, but the match was not without its share of controversy.",
      "The Red Devils were held to a 2-2 draw by Forest in Saturday's Premier League clash, with Casemiro netting the first goal at the City Ground. The home side took the lead in the second half, owing to goals from Morgan Gibbs-White and Nicolo Savona, before Amad Diallo levelled the score for United in the final minutes.",
      "That draw brought an end to United's three-match winning run in the Premier League - causing Ruben Amorim's squad to drop to seventh place in the standings. However, the game was surrounded in controversy, particularly when it came to Casemiro's opening goal - after a corner appeared to be incorrectly given to United.",
      "United were given a corner after the ball was deemed to have gone out of play - although some replays suggest that at least part of the ball may have still been in play. From the corner, Casemiro scored with a header, sparking frustration from Forest boss Sean Dyche and the home supporters.",
      "Post-match, Dyche expressed to BBC Sport his belief that VAR should be used to verify decisions such as corner kicks, which could have prevented United from having the opportunity to score the first goal. However, former Newcastle United striker Alan Shearer - while agreeing that the ball did go out of play - disagreed with the need for VAR intervention.",
      "\"Sean Dyche has got a point, I'm not sure how the assistant referee on the far side can actually see that far and then be absolutely certain that the ball was out [of play]. Because it wasn't, it was nearly 70 yards away, so they can't be certain because the ball isn't out [of play],\" said Shearer on Match of the Day.",
      "\"I agree with Sean, I understand his frustration and his anger, but I wouldn't say we'd like to get VAR involved - because the game his stopping and starting as it is.",
      "\"I know he says it will only take four or five seconds, but I wouldn't encourage that. But I would encourage the officials to do their job properly and get it right and not guess, because they've guessed there and got it wrong.\"",
      "In his post-match interview, Dyche said: \"It's not inconclusive. I've seen it back.",
      "\"That's two decisions that aren't right that have gone against us. They give corners that aren't corners. They gave one last week and one this week. It's a really poor decision. That decides a lot. We are fighting for our lives to get up the table.\"",
      "\"From where I was standing, I was pretty far away, I didn't know if it went out. I haven't been able to check it yet, but all the boys were saying at half-time.",
      "\"The analysts, they said the ball had never gone out, so I think it's something that needs to be looked at because it happened twice to us now in two weeks. Last week against Bournemouth it wasn't their corner - so it's something they need to look at because it's cost us two points.\"",

      "David Beckham appeared to have sabotaged his chances of receiving a knighthood after a series of stunning emails were leaked. The England icon was granted his wish this summer as he was finally given the esteemed accolade after years of waiting.",
      "However, the Inter Miami co-owner could've had his 'sir' moniker far earlier, had it not been for a flurry of controversial emails said to have been sent from the star to his long-standing PR Simon Oliveira.",
      "Beckham, 50, was reportedly given the all clear to receive a knighthood in the New Year's Honours List for 2022. Yet, it wasn't to be because of the emails that dated back to 2017.",
      "The Manchester United idol is alleged to have called the honours committee \"unappreciative c***s.\" He also allegedly claimed that he didn't actually \"care about being knighted,\" while the ex-Real Madrid winger is said to have questioned why opera star Katherine Jenkins was awarded an OBE.",
      "\"For what? Singing at the rugby and going to see the troops,\" Beckham is alleged to have asked in reference to Jenkins receiving the honour, which she was granted in the 2014 New Year's Honours List.",
      "Following his snub, Beckham is also reported to have said: \"I expected nothing less. It's a disgrace to be honest and if I was American I would of got something like this 10 years ago.\"",
      "At the time, Beckham's representative slammed the reports, accusing them of being misleading and based on manipulated content. They said: \"This story is based on outdated material taken out of context from hacked and doctored private emails from a third-party server and gives a deliberately inaccurate picture.\"",
      "A close friend of Beckham also insisted that some of the emails had been \"doctored\" while others had been written \"in the heat of the moment.\"",
      "Beckham did receive an OBE of his own in 2003. However, the leaked emails were allegedly sent after he was denied the higher honour. Despite the controversy, Beckham was recognised in the King's Birthday Honours List for his services to Sport and Charity this year.",
      "Speaking out about the recognition, he said he was \"humbled\". He added: \"I’m so lucky to be able to do the work that I do and I’m grateful to be recognised for work that gives me so much fulfilment.",
      "\"It will take a little while for the news to sink in but I'm immensely proud and it's such an emotional moment for me to share with my family.\"",
      "Beckham, who played 115 times for England and captained the Three Lions, has continued to make notable donations to charity. He has also struck up a firm friendship with King Charles over the years.",
      "David's wife Victoria Beckham later wrote a loving tribute to her husband, sharing her pride at his new knighthood. The Instagram post also made reference to the star's dedication to his family.",
      "Victoria, 51, posted a snap of her kissing a smiling David on the cheek as she wrote in the caption: \"You’ve always been my knight in shining armour, but now it’s official. Sir @davidbeckham!!! What an honour, I couldn’t be prouder of you.",
      "\"Your dedication to the things that matter most — your country, your work, your passion, and most of all, your family — has never wavered.",
      "\"The way you’ve touched so many lives over the years with kindness and humility speaks volumes about the man you are and continues to inspire us everyday. But above all else, I’m so, so proud to call you mine. I love you so much xxxx.\"",

      "Manchester United legend Brian McClair was barely recognisable during a charity match for legends due to his drastically changed appearance. The 61-year-old football icon was in the dugout for Celtic in their September clash against the Red Devils, with former players taking to the pitch to raise funds for a worthy cause.",
      "Sporting long white hair and a bushy beard, McClair confessed that fellow ex-United stars including Dimitar Berbatov and Louis Saha didn't recognise him when entering the Celtic dressing room. The former Scotland international shared: \"I was going between each dressing room and just listening to people chatting.",
      "\"It was nice to see ex-United kit man Albert Morgan, who was telling me what was happening with them. It was good to see people I shared rooms with as well.",
      "\"I had all the Celtic kit on and saw Louis Saha. He just looked up and said, 'F****** hell, I didn't recognise you.' I said that was me tidied up and making an effort.\" McClair, who hosts his Life with Brian podcast, added: \"Then I was outside and Berbatov was there and I said, 'Hello, you all right?'",
      "\"He just looked at me kind of strangely but then I went back in again and he came over. He said, 'I'm sorry, I didn't recognise you, I thought it might have been you but thought no, no, it couldn't possibly be you.' It was nice to be recognised anyway even under this cunning disguise.\"",
      "This isn't the first occasion the former striker has become a viral sensation thanks to his present appearance, as he went viral on social media in 2023 following a photograph with a supporter at a Manchester pub.",
      "Speaking about his dramatic change from the cropped hair and clean-shaven appearance he sported during his playing career, McClair previously revealed to The Telegraph: \"It started in lockdown.",
      "\"I just thought: let things grow, see where we end up. Then before Christmas I decided to have a tidy up, but I never got round to it.",
      "\"I was out one night and next thing I see I'm trending on social media as 'old man down the pub'. I've had the trim since. You'll be disappointed to hear I look a wee bit less as though I've been cast away on a desert island.\"",
      "The focus the four-time Premier League champion received when supporters recognised his fresh appearance was \"bizarre,\" he confessed. He continued: \"I think I'm normal, others think I'm weird. I tend to notice bizarre things, bizarre things come out of my head.\"",
      "The charity fixture saw McClair lead former Celts including Joe Hart, Artur Boruc and Georgios Samaras, whilst United legend Bryan Robson fielded players like Michael Carrick, Nicky Butt and Wes Brown.",
      "The Scottish outfit emerged triumphant through a penalty shootout following a 2-2 draw in regular time. The victory marked the second consecutive occasion that the Celtic legends defeated their English rivals.",

      "Ruben Amorim finds himself in one of the strongest positions since arriving at Manchester United as he marks his first year in charge. On November 1, 2024, United confirmed the Sporting CP boss would take over from Erik ten Hag permanently, with his tenure officially starting 10 days later.",
      "The past 12 months have proved challenging for Amorim. The Portuguese manager struggled to make an instant impact on United's performances, presiding over the club's poorest league campaign in decades, while also missing out on Champions League qualification after defeat in the Europa League final.",
      "Yet recent weeks have seen a marked improvement, with the squad's summer recruits playing a key role in the club's best Premier League form under Amorim's reign. On the first anniversary of his appointment, United secured a 2-2 draw away to Nottingham Forest, bringing an end to a three-match winning streak.",
      "There have been several moments when many believed Amorim's position was under serious threat, not least earlier this campaign following the Carabao Cup embarrassment against Grimsby. Despite Amorim regularly facing criticism, the United board have consistently shown faith in the 40-year-old manager.",
      "One factor in Amorim maintaining the backing of United's hierarchy may be the manager's steadfast belief in his methods, alongside his uncompromising approach towards his squad. The Daily Mail has reported that certain players within the United dressing room have found Amorim to be \"aloof and arrogant at times.\"",
      "This straightforward style may well have helped Amorim when it came to building his squad. Back in January, when quizzed about Marcus Rashford's continued omission, Amorim insisted he'd sooner select goalkeeper coach Jorge Vital than a player not pulling their weight in training. Rashford subsequently joined Aston Villa on loan before spending this campaign at Barcelona.",
      "The United manager's self-assurance also stretches to his tactics. He declared earlier this season that \"not even the Pope\" could persuade him to abandon his preferred 3-4-2-1 system. Yet United co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe seems to value Amorim's forthright approach.",
      "\"I really, really like Ruben,\" Ratcliffe told The Times in March. \"He's a very thoughtful guy. Every time I go to the training ground, I speak to Ruben. I sit down and have a cup of coffee with him and tell him where it's going wrong, and he tells me to f*** off! I like him.\"",
      "The report revealed that Amorim and Ratcliffe regularly have phone conversations and stay in touch through WhatsApp groups. For his part, Amorim values the relationship he's built with Ratcliffe during his time at the club.",
      "\"I think we have a really good connection,\" he said. \"We are both a little bit blunt and honest in conversations. He really likes the club, he's like a fan.\"",
      "The United manager continued: \"It's a good thing because publicly, it's a different thing. It shows a lot of confidence from the owner. I felt it since day one. Since day one, I felt that the people really like my work.",
      "\"My work is the result, so also sometimes it's harder for me - my relationship with them - than theirs with me. We're really honest with each other. I'm a little bit the same.",
      "\"I came from a normal family and now I'm here in Manchester and I'm still the same person. I feel that he is the same [type of] person, so we can talk like that.\"",
      "While Amorim's blunt exchanges with Ratcliffe and no-nonsense transfer strategy might raise eyebrows, it has proved vital in helping the Portuguese boss navigate a challenging year at Old Trafford. Having weathered numerous storms, United could find themselves in a far stronger position under Amorim's leadership 12 months from now.",

      "Gary Neville has delivered a brutal assessment of Benjamin Sesko - insisting that the striker is 'well off it' despite flashes of promise in Manchester United's 2-2 draw with Nottingham Forest.",
      "The Slovenia international, who sealed his move to Old Trafford during the summer from RB Leipzig for an initial £66.4million fee, has yet to demonstrate his finest form. United had made signing a striker their top priority, with Sesko being one of three forwards to join the club alongside Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha.",
      "The Red Devils' primary target had been Viktor Gyokeres, who instead opted to join rivals Arsenal, his favoured destination. Sesko, however, was pinpointed as an alternative choice, having been monitored by the club since way back in 2022.",
      "Since the campaign began, Sesko has been handed six starts under Ruben Amorim. At the City Ground, he was given consecutive starts after providing an assist in last weekend's 4-2 triumph over Brighton.",
      "During the first half, the 22-year-old had several opportunities come his way, but then found himself restricted to minimal chances after the break. Neville, however, expressed his frustration with Sesko's display and continues to demand greater output from him.",
      "\"I'm no further forward with him. The jury is out,\" Neville told NBC Sports. \"He's well off it compared to the other summer signings that Man United made up front in Cunha and Mbeumo.",
      "\"He looks awkward, he had a couple of really good opportunities in the first half - when balls got played over the top. And his touch wasn't quite right.",
      "\"For £80million, you can say he's young, or has a lot of potential and he's only just settling in, but you still want to see a bit more.\" United were hoping to grab a fourth straight triumph after defeating Sunderland, rivals Liverpool and then Brighton, but were forced to accept a stalemate at the City Ground.",
      "Casemiro put Amorim's team ahead, albeit in controversial fashion, and Morgan Gibbs-White and Nicola Savona netted within two minutes of the restart to flip the match on its head. Amad salvaged a point with less than ten minutes left on the clock.",
      "Following the final whistle, Amorim commended his squad's battling qualities - after they fell behind.",
      "\"I feel in the recent past if we had had this situation, going from 1-0 up to 2-1 down, we would've struggled so much more than we did today,\" the Portuguese head coach said.",

      "Manchester United's new signing Benjamin Sesko is being cheered on by his girlfriend Anita Vidovic at Old Trafford. The striker was signed this summer for £74million from RB Leipzig.",
      "Ruben Amorim's squad has seen a recent surge in form following a disappointing start to the season, with some of their new summer signings starting to find their footing. In United's most recent clash against Brighton, both Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha found the back of the net.",
      "Sesko also featured in this 4-2 victory, and although he didn't manage to score, he demonstrated his growing rapport with his team-mates by setting up Mbeumo's first goal.",
      "Throughout this time, he's been backed by his partner Anita, who is five years his senior and has a brother who might be familiar to many Brits due to his appearance on a well-known reality TV show.",
      "Anita, 27, hails from Slovenia like Sesko and is said to have graduated from the University of Ljubljana's Faculty of Public Administration. Sesko is currently 22 years old.",
      "The pair reportedly started dating in 2022, but they've kept a relatively low profile, only appearing together in a handful of social media posts. Anita is no stranger to the football scene, as her brother Boris played professionally in Germany and Poland before hanging up his boots in 2024.",
      "Boris gained popularity earlier this year when he appeared on series 12 of Love Island UK, entering the villa as a Casa Amor bombshell. Whilst Sesko rarely shares glimpses of his partner on social media, limiting Anita's appearances to the odd Instagram post, the 27-year-old WAG frequently documents her boyfriend's thoughtful gestures on TikTok.",
      "Anita's videos, which typically attract around 20,000 views apiece, highlight Sesko's tender moments for birthdays, anniversaries and other memorable occasions. Her profile features numerous clips of the pair dancing, cuddling affectionately and travelling together, alongside footage of her cheering him on from the stands at Leipzig.",
      "In a recent post from early 2025, Anita shared a montage of romantic moments between them, writing, \"It was always you,\" alongside a white heart emoji. The compilation shows Sesko interacting with a young lion cub, honing his skills at the driving range, watching a basketball match and dancing aboard a boat.",
      "Sesko's opening months at Old Trafford have proved inconsistent, though he has acknowledged there is considerably more to deliver, and he is still adapting to the pace of the Premier League.",
      "\"In the end, this is my job; trying to score as many goals as possible, trying to win the games, trying to help the team in every single situation, and hopefully [there is] more to come,\" he said earlier in October after netting in United's victory against Sunderland.",
      "\"There is loads [still] to come, definitely. I'm still getting used to it more and more, to read the players, to connect with them even more. I believe I can be even better and I will try to show it.",
      "\"I think it's way quicker, you have less time in general, I think this is one of the biggest changes I would say, and obviously also the physicality, everyone is really physical and athletic.",
      "\"I am getting used to it and I will come to the level of this soon. To play for a club like this or even train every single day, it's an obvious pleasure.\"",

      "There is only one set of Premier League supporters who should be truly furious about the Boxing Day fixture list - Newcastle United. Getting away from Old Trafford after a night game is mildly hellish at the best of times. Having to do it deep, deep, deep into Boxing Day will be a real pain.",
      "Of course, the Premier League’s Boxing Day fixture list is not actually a list. It is one fixture. Manchester United versus Newcastle United at 8pm. And it seems quite a lot of people are in uproar. They are all going on about something known as ‘tradition’.",
      "Well, it was once a tradition to play games on Christmas Day but we don’t miss that routine since it stopped in the late 1950s. And don’t forget, the owners of Premier League clubs have long since sold tradition to the highest bidders.",
      "Yes, Newcastle fans have a right to be annoyed at the prospect of that seven-hour return journey to Manchester late on Boxing Day but that annoyance should be with the club’s owners. Similarly, the buck stops with them for the demolition of the Premier League’s Boxing Day programme.",
      "Because whichever way you look at the fixture list, it is, essentially, dictated by the demands of television. The brief given to the Premier League by club owners down the years has been simple … get as much money as you can.",
      "And the Premier League executives - led by Richard Masters - have obliged. The latest domestic deal - which runs for four years from the start of this season - is worth £6.7billion. Great.",
      "Which is also a contributory factor, it seems, to there being only one Premier League fixture, a situation that has wound up a lot of people, it seems. I might be in a minority but it seems no big deal.",
      "In fact, on a traditional sporting day, it will be nice for fans to maybe go and watch their local non-league team (there is a full programme). Or go and watch an EFL game (there is a full programme).",
      "Or sit back and watch the highlights from the first day’s play of the fourth Ashes Test (with England already three up). Or have a flutter on one of National Hunt's big races, the King George at Kempton.",
      "Some of us complain about the dominance of the Premier League. So, you can’t get too upset when it leaves the stage clear for others.",
      "You can, though, complain about some of the inconsiderate, often scandalous scheduling of fixtures. Just make sure those complaints are directed at the owners who have sold the Premier League to television.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Manchester United boss Ruben Amorim has fired an early warning ahead of the Africa Cup of Nations, but he isn't the only manager wary of losing players in December. Amorim's concern is maybe more pronounced than that of some rivals, though, with Ivorian international Amad and Cameroon forward Bryan Mbeumo having combined well down the right flank.",
      "\"We will have time to suffer,\" Amorim said when discussing the pair. \"We are going to struggle a little bit, but we already knew it's going to be an opportunity.",
      "\"When I watch the training, there are players that should be playing, but it's hard with one game to take some players from the team, because they are doing well also during the training in games. So other players are going to have the opportunity to help us.",
      "\"They are understanding the way we want to play, so if we are improving on that, the change of characteristics is not going to change the idea or the momentum of the team. But let's use Amad and Bryan in these games and we will see in general.\"",
      "The Africa Cup of Nations begins on December 21, with players linking up with their national sides a little before then. With the final not taking place until January 18, some teams could be without senior stars for a full month, and Amad's goal against Nottingham Forest only reinforced how big a miss he may be.",
      "There are some high-profile absentees from the upcoming AFCON, with Ghana among those missing out. That means the likes of Mohammed Kudus and Antoine Semenyo will stay with their clubs while other African stars head out to Morocco for the tournament.",
      "League leaders Arsenal won't suffer any disruption, but it's a different story for their title rivals. Manchester City will lose Rayan Ait-Nouri to the Algerian national team and Omar Marmoush to Egypt, while Liverpool star Mohamed Salah can also expect to be part of Egypt's squad.",
      "High-flying Bournemouth and Sunderland both have representatives pushing for a place in hosts Morocco's squad, with Amine Adli and Chemsdine Talbi both called up in the October break. Talbi isn't Sunderland's only potential absentee, with Reinildo (Mozambique), Habib Diarra (Senegal), Simon Adingra (Cote d'Ivoire), Bertrand Traore (Burkina Faso) and Arthur Masuaku and Noah Sadiki (both DR Congo) all qualifying and backup keeper Blondy Nna Noukeu an outside bet for the Cameroon squad.,.",
      "Tottenham will keep Kudus in London but potentially lose both Yves Bissouma (Mali) and Pape Matar Sarr (Senegal). United, as mentioned, will be without Amad and Mbeumo, while Noussair Mazraoui could be back in the Morocco picture after injury.",
      "Chelsea have a chance to take advantage in December and January with no first-teamers away at AFCON, while Aston Villa will only lose Ivorian international Evann Guessand. Crystal Palace could have a tougher time of things, though, with Ismaila Sarr (Senegal) and Christantus Uche (Nigeria) both in recent national squads while Cheick Doucoure (Mali) and Chadi Riad (Morocco) could yet represent their countries if they recover from long-term injuries in time.",
      "Brentford are preparing to lose record signing Dango Ouattara (Burkina Faso) and midfielder Frank Onyeka (Nigeria) as well as young goalkeeper Marley Tavaziva (Zimbabwe), and they aren't the only ones at risk of losing a big-money summer addition. Yoane Wissa (DR Congo) has yet to make his Newcastle debut but could be away on international duty before long.",
      "There's some welcome news for Brighton with Yankuba Minteh's Gambia side failing to qualify, though Carlos Baleba is set to link up with his Cameroon team-mates. Everton striker Beto will also stay home after Guinea-Bissau only finished third in their qualifying group, but Iliman Ndiaye and Idrissa Gueye (both Senegal) and summer signing Adam Aznou (Morocco) may well be missing.",
      "Leeds have no one departing for Morocco but it's a different story for fellow new boys Burnley. Former England youth international Axel Tuanzebe now represents DR Congo at international level, while Hannibal is in the picture for Tunisia and Lyle Foster scored goals for South Africa in their qualification campaign.",
      "The final four clubs in the Premier League will be affected to different degrees. Alex Iwobi (Nigeria) could be a big miss for Fulham, with Calvin Bassey and Samuel Chukwueze also part of the last Super Eagles squad, though Nottingham Forest's former Fulham man Ola Aina could end up missing the tournament through injury and Taiwo Awoniyi is not an automatic pick for manager Eric Chelle.",
      "Forest are still expected to lose Willy Boly and Ibrahim Sangare (both Cote d'Ivoire), while West Ham are preparing to be without full-backs Aaron Wan-Bissaka (DR Congo) and El-Hadji Malick Diouf (Senegal). Finally, Wolves could find themselves without several players including Marshall Munetsi and Tawanda Chirewa (both Zimbabwe), Emmanuel Agbadou (Cote d'Ivoire), Tolu Arokodare (Nigeria) and Jackson Tchatchoua (Cameroon).",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Manchester United have been linked with several players ahead of the January transfer window. The Red Devils may be primarily focused on their Premier League campaign but the club will already be making recruitment plans behind the scenes.",
      "United’s summer signings have made an early impact, with Senne Lammens becoming the club’s first-choice goalkeeper while forwards Bryan Mbeumo, Matheus Cunha and Benjamin Sesko have provided the team with more attacking options. Manager Ruben Amorim will hope United can make more positive signings when the transfer window reopens in January.",
      "Ruben Amorim is already prepared for some of his United players to ask to leave the club in January. While the Red Devils have found a somewhat settled side, others are struggling for regular starts, such as Kobbie Mainoo, who handed in a loan request during the summer.",
      "\"A lot of things can happen,” Amorim said in a recent press conference. \"Even in our club, and you know that we have the World Cup, some players are not playing, they will ask to leave, so I have to manage everything.\"",
      "However, the United boss is not solely focused on the club’s potential outgoings. Amorim has insisted the club will look to sign players who could have a long-lasting impact on his side.",
      "\"We want to bring players, everyone here, we want to bring players that we can see a big future in Manchester United,\" he continued. \"We are not just buying one guy because now we feel in December that we need this kind of player for now.",
      "\"We want to buy players that we know we are not going to change a lot of times. So that is our idea. I don't know what is going to happen. But of course, we think about how we can improve the team, and in January, the window is open, we can do something.\"",
      "Former United winger Nani believes the club should reignite their interest in Joao Palhinha, who favoured a move to Bayern Munich over Old Trafford last year. The Portuguese midfielder has since been loaned out to Tottenham Hotspur, where he has been a regular starter, with Spurs having the option to sign him permanently for £27million in the summer.",
      "Nani is a former team-mate of Palhinha’s from their time at Sporting CP and believes he could be a success at United. \"He's a player with energy, with power to recover balls and to fight - and that is something that fits into Man Utd's DNA,” Nani told Covers.com.",
      "“Having players who are able first to fight on the field, like to recover the ball and challenge opponents to help the team win games. You can't give your opponents any time in the Premier League and he has the energy and physical abilities to be such an asset for anyone.\"",
      "Bournemouth forward Antoine Semenyo has admitted to being aware of the speculation around his future. He was a reported target for United and Liverpool during the summer, with Semenyo claimed to have met with Amorim before signing a new Bournemouth contract.",
      "The Cherries are said to value Semenyo at around £75million, but the transfer noise has not impacted Semenyo’s early performances this term. Despite seeing many of his team-mates seal high-profile transfers, the 25-year-old has explained his decision to stay with Bournemouth.",
      "\"I'm enjoying my football here. If I'm not scoring goals, all of that goes away. I try to stay present, do the best I can for the team, score goals and whatever happens in the future happens.",
      "\"When they (his former team-mates) all left [in the summer], there was a lot of interest and back and forth with the club. But I knew in my head that the manager's got something up his sleeve this year.”",

      "Marcus Rashford and Barcelona have already had discussions over the prospect of a permanent move at the end of the season. The La Liga champions have an option in the forward's loan deal to complete a deal with Manchester United.",
      "Rashford, 28, has impressed in his opening months with the Catalan club. The forward has bagged five goals and offered seven assists under Hansi Flick in his debut season at Camp Nou.",
      "Rashford's representatives have already spoken with club officials over the prospect of coming to terms, according to reports in Spain. And Barca acknowledge that any decision over Rashford will be key to their future strategy.",
      "The side's limited salary space and persistent financial issues mean any deal to land Rashford will impact their ability to sign a top centre-forward, with uncertainty over Robert Lewandowski's future. It is said that 'financial engineering' will be required to come to an agreement.",
      "The report claims that Rashford could be offered a longer contract, until 2030, providing he reduces his salary. The United academy product has already taken a pay-cut to join Barcelona this season and may have to be willing to do so next summer, even with increased competition for his signature, should his form continue.",
      "Sporting director Deco has already warned that decisions regarding players such as Rashford, Lewandowski, and Andreas Christensen will be made at the end of the season. But, it appears the club are happy to extend Rashford's time in Catalonia.",
      "Former Manchester United striker Wayne Rooney is disappointed that Rashford's success has had to come away from Old Trafford. The forward was not involved in the Red Devils' pre-season before agreeing his loan move.",
      "\"I'd much prefer to see him do that for Man United, if I'm honest,\" he said on BBC Sport's The Wayne Rooney Show podcast, as he admitted to feeling sad about how the England star's United career has panned out.",
      "\"But no, listen... I don't think it was the easiest start, the first couple of games, and there were people talking about him, but he's got his head down, he's doing well, he's playing well, and for any young English player, and especially someone you know and you want to do well, it's great to see that,\" he added.",
      "\"Listen, Marcus Rashford at his best is a top, top player and that's what we all want to see and just hope he stays settled and he keeps performing, keeps working and if he does that then I don't think there's any doubt about his ability.\"",

De Laurentiis has spoken to Napoli stars Kevin De Bruyne and Scott McTominay about Mainoo - and the duo have told him the England midfielder would be a great signing for Antonio Conte's side.",
      "Napoli tried to sign Mainoo in the summer, but he decided to remain at United when Ruben Amorim told him he wanted to keep him. But Mainoo has remained on the fringes of Amorim's team and has made just eight appearances in all competitions this season.",
      "It's understood Napoli want to take Mainoo on an initial loan, with a view to making the deal permanent in the summer. Mainoo knows he will have to leave Old Trafford to secure regular starts, if he wants to stand a realistic chance of being included in England's squad for the 2026 World Cup.",
      "Napoli have enjoyed success by signing unwanted United players, with McTominay being named the Serie A Player of the Season in their title-winning campaign. Rasmus Hojlund has also made a strong start since joining on loan in the summer, scoring four goals in seven games so far.",
      "Mainoo fits into the same category as a frustrated player who is seeking regular game time. Coming into this weekend, the 20-year-old United academy graduate had started just one game for United this season, and that came in their disastrous defeat by Grimsby in the Carabao Cup.",
      "He has been stuck as a substitute in the Premier League, with Amorim picking Casemiro and Bruno Fernandes in central midfield. Mainoo's exit was blocked on deadline day, with Amorim explaining in September what he expects from the youngster.",

      "A year ago on Saturday, Ruben Amorim was announced as the new Manchester United manager, succeeding Erik ten Hag, who left under a cloud.",
      "The United head coach wanted to take on his new role at the end of the 2024/25 season, but Ineos were insistent. It was either November or never – Amorim chose to jump on board.",
      "His first press conference at Carrington was not held until later that month. Beaming in front of the packed press conference room, Amorim set out a positive message as he looked to bring the current squad on the journey with him.",
      "\"I am a little bit of a dreamer and I believe in myself,\" he said back then. \"I also believe in the club, as I think we have the same idea, the same mindset, so that can help. But I truly believe in the players also, I know that you guys don't believe a lot in these players, but I believe a lot and I think we have room to improve.\"",
      "Fast forward to November 2025, Amorim may not have got the perfect result, but he did get the perfect gift from one of his players in the post-match interviews. Speaking in the mixed zone to MEN Sport, Amad said something which will be music to the manager's ears.",
      "\"I think winning games always gives players confidence and now I think everyone is in a good moment as a team, we are learning every day with the manager because we believe in his system,\" Amad explained. \"But today we are really disappointed because, as a team, we didn’t win.",
      "\"Yeah, of course [we are making progress under Amorim]. At first it wasn’t easy for him and for us, but now we are trying to understand his system and we are trying to do the best every game and we want to win every game because we want to deliver with this club where they deserve to be and we are trying to do that also.\"",
      "Amad's vote of confidence for Amorim's system and way of playing will perhaps mean as much to the United boss as the backing Sir Jim Ratcliffe gave him in October. The Ivorian also believes that United are showing signs of improvement that were not there last season.",
      "\"I think now that the play is getting better and better every game,\" he added. \"When you win, you always have confidence.",
      "\"As a player, I am starting to learn this system with the manager because we are playing in a new system so we have to learn. I think we can get better every game, every day and we are training very hard and I hope we can bring this club to the next level.\"",
      "The only way that Amad and his teammates will be able to do that is by continuing to secure good results both at home and on the road. Next up is a trip to Tottenham Hotspur and the 23-year-old is under no illusions about the scale of that task.",
      "\"We will prepare the game in the week and we know Tottenham is a big team, a good team, we have to be focused until the end and try to have three points there,\" he concluded.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "However, a hint to his fitness was clear when the teams emerged for their warm-ups. Noussair Mazraoui and Maguire came out between 10-15 minutes after their teammates and while the Moroccan immediately joined in with the substitutes, Maguire did some running drills alone.",
      "Unsurprisingly he was an unused substitute at the City Ground.",
      "Neville targeted by chants",
      "On a couple of occasions United fans were reminded that Gary Neville is an unpopular figure at Forest. His comments about the owner Evangelos Marinakis last season saw him banned from co-commentary of Forest's Premier League finale against Chelsea.",
      "A new season has not come with a change of heart from the home faithful and it appears from the chants aimed at Neville that the United legend is still not welcome on the River Trent.",
      "Cunha practices the dark arts",
      "You would have expected Forest players to be surrounding referee Darren England as he walked off the pitch at half-time. But it was Matheus Cunha who led the complaints.",
      "He felt he had been pushed in the face just before the break by Ryan Yates. Cunha has previously worked with Diego Simeone and perhaps some of the Atletico Madrid boss' tricks have been taken on board to the Brazilian.",
      "United frustrations avoided",
      "The United analysts were sat in the press box during the game and for the most part you would not have noticed they were there. However, when United were losing and Benjamin Sesko passed the ball out of play, a recognisable thump of a hand hitting a desk could be heard.",
      "It was unfair on Sesko who enjoyed a good game and Amad's equaliser has perhaps saved the striker's sloppiness from being highlighted.",

      "The Reds were staring defeat in the face before Amad popped up to score a breathtaking goal with nine minutes remaining, which ensured the points were shared.",
      "Here are how United's players rated at the City Ground:",
      "Senne Lammens",
      "Made a few important saves and was helpless for the two Forest goals, particularly the second. 6.",
      "Leny Yoro",
      "The bulk of Forest's attacking play came down the opposite side to Yoro. That is perhaps a compliment to the Frenchman. 6",
      "Matthijs de Ligt",
      "Made a superb recovery to thwart Nicolò Savona in the first half. Should have done better for Forest's second. 6",
      "Luke Shaw",
      "Will play himself back into the England squad if he continues like this. Unfortunate to be part of a defensive unit that conceded twice. 6",
      "Amad",
      "Had two really good chances when cutting in from the right wing. Had no chance to win the header against Gibbs-White and scored a stunning goal to make it 2-2. 7",
      "Casemiro",
      "Opened the scoring with a brilliant header. Looked tired as the game progressed, but completed 90 minutes in the Premier League for the first time this season. 6",
      "Bruno Fernandes",
      "Was relatively quiet in the first half until he played a lovely delivery into the box for Casemiro's goal. Hit the post in the second half and Casemiro could not convert the rebound. 6",
      "Diogo Dalot",
      "There are always question marks around Dalot when he plays on the left side and he was exposed at various stages of the contest. Amorim demanded more from him and he didn't rise to the occasion. 3",
      "Bryan Mbeumo",
      "Playing with huge confidence and could have recorded a few assists if chances had been taken. Played a teasing ball to Benjamin Sesko in the first half but the striker did not gamble on it. 7",
      "Benjamin Sesko",
      "Scuffed a chance in the box at the beginning of the game and dragged another shot wide after skilfully creating a yard of space for himself. Looked sharp and provided a focal point but failed to score. 5",
      "Matheus Cunha",
      "Although he worked hard he wasn't at his creative best. 6",
      "Patrick Dorgu",
      "An improvement on Dalot. 6",
      "Noussair Mazraoui",
      "Provided quality at the back. 6",

      "Morgan Gibbs-White levelled the scores in the 48th minute and Nicolo Savona made it 2-1 just two minutes later.",
      "Forest fans sensed their first win in the league since August, but Amad popped up with nine minutes remaining to score a stunning goal which ensured the points were shared.",
      "Amorim was asked whether United would have lost the fixture last season and responded: \"Yeah.\"",
      "He paused before adding: \"By more goals [they would have lost]. That is my feeling.\"",
      "When asked why, Amorim said: \"It's the confidence, of course, it's completely different. We came from three good games and we have a different confidence. We understand each other better.",
      "\"We talk more about this, that football is like this, and we proved it this year. We can have bad moments, but suddenly we have three good games. So football is like that. And the game is like that also.",
      "\"We had good moments, we score, you can sense we are in control of the game when the first half finished. We started the second half, we suffer, disconnect for five minutes and that's enough in the Premier League, but we managed to recover from that, which is a good feeling.\"",
      "Discussing his thoughts on the game in further detail, Amorim said: \"We lost control of the game for five minutes and paid the price. We did some things well. Our level of energy dropped a little bit.",
      "\"And when our energy drops a little bit, you can feel it. We can play well, but it's not full power. But my feeling is that the players tried, really tried. They tried during the week and tried again today.",
      "\"In the past, if we had this kind of bad five minutes and we suffer two goals, we didn't recover. Today is a different feeling and you can sense we could win this game, but we weren't going to lose, and that's sometimes the feeling a big team sometimes has.",
      "\"We had the opportunity to win in the end, but we drew. We dropped two points. I think last year we suffered a lot. We want to win games and overcome these moments, but now they know how to do it.",
      "\"We just need to be inside of the game until the final 10 minutes of the game. That is part of football. In the past, we could have lost everything in the positions and the way we play the game.",
      "\"I think we are improving in that aspect. Again, we did some things right, but we also have potential to play so much better, which is the goal.\"",

      "In their efforts to sign a new midfielder, meanwhile, United are reportedly keeping tabs on Elliot Anderson, who they came up against at the City Ground for Nottingham Forest in the Premier League on Saturday afternoon. Reports from CaughtOffside namedrop United, Chelsea, Manchester City and former club - Newcastle United - as possible suitors for the newly-capped England international.",

      "Marcus Rashford has scored for the second time in La Liga this evening with a well-taken goal in Barcelona's game with Elche FC.",
      "The forward had scored just one league goal for Barca this season, but has registered five assists. He has also scored four goals in the Champions League.",
      "On Sunday, the 28-year-old put Hansi Flick's men 3-1 up with a great solo goal in Spain.",
      "Napoli are reportedly ready to pay all of Kobbie Mainoo's wages to sign him on loan in January.",

      "\"We want to buy players that we know we are not going to change a lot of times. So that is our idea. I don't know what is going to happen. But of course, we think about how we can improve the team, and in January, the window is open, we can do something.\"",

      "In the summer of 2014, Louis van Gaal found himself with a dilemma on his hands.",
      "The first season post-Sir Alex Ferguson did not go according to plan as David Moyes was sacked. Ryan Giggs was appointed to fill the gap temporarily and to compound everything, the defining centre-back partnership of a generation - Rio Ferdinand and Nemanja Vidic - was no more.",
      "So, as has become tradition at Old Trafford, United turned to the youth. Tyler Blackett spent the 2013/14 season on loan at Blackpool and Birmingham City but was handed his chance to impress during that summer's pre-season tour.",
      "Speaking exclusively to MEN Sport, Blackett reflected on his first impressions of the Dutchman, his time with United and what he has done since. \"Obviously it was pre-season when he [Van Gaal] came in, he is kind of how you see him,\" the 31-year-old began.",
      "\"Very professional, direct and has an idea of what he wants and knows what he wants too. I enjoyed playing under his management and his way of playing, I was young at that point and when you see such an experienced manager come in and they want to work with you and they are interested in you, it gives you that confidence to go on and do what I did at that point.\"",
      "Blackett went on to start the opening five matches of the Premier League season and while his appearances slowed towards the end of the 2014/15 campaign, the defender was still seen as part of the plans for United's future. However, a decision the following summer changed the course of his career.",
      "\"I played that full season in the first team at Man United and again, you are young and you are not really understanding and looking at things from a different perspective,\" Blackett reflected. \"I remember I had a conversation with Louis van Gaal in his office, we had spoken about the season previous and his plans for the upcoming season.",
      "\"He said this season I am going to bring in X, Y, Z, because we want to challenge even more going into the new season. That is obviously understandable, it is Man United and you need to challenge.",
      "\"But for me as a young player and not being mature at that point, I’m thinking I want to play and actually still have a chance to play because he was telling me with the players that he was bringing in, there would not be much chance for me to get the same amount of game time and I was going to have to fight for my place or go out on loan, which was again understandable when you look back on it.",
      "\"I was probably wrongly advised to look at loan moves at that point, I had time and years left on my deal to challenge for my place so why would anyone at that point leave? Looking back, would I have gone out on loan? Probably not.\"",
      "But go on loan Blackett did and while he doesn't regret choosing Celtic, there was an acceptance that it was not the right decision. \"I tend not to regret anything because the way that I see things, at the time that is what I wanted,\" he said.",
      "\"When you make these choices, you are always going to learn lessons from them, gain experience. You can look in hindsight and say: ‘Yeah, would I have made different choices? Probably,’ but that is the choice I made and that is what I stick with and that is how you learn in life.",
      "\"What I will say is, if the sporting director, head scout, whoever it is bringing in the players signs you, it is always better if the manager wants you there and that wasn’t the case at Celtic, the manager [Ronny Deila] didn’t necessarily want me there. He had his own ideas how he wanted me to play and the team to play so from day one it wasn’t set on a great foundation.\"",
      "Sadly for Blackett, after being frozen out of the Celtic team from October, he returned to Old Trafford to see that Van Gaal had been sacked after winning the FA Cup and replaced by, Jose Mourinho. After a poor stint in Glasgow though, Blackett knew his chances of playing under Mourinho were slim.",
      "\"That [Van Gaal being sacked] happens and then me being out on loan and not really playing the amount of minutes I should have been playing or hoped to have played, doesn’t then look good for the new manager and it all had a spiralling effect,\" Blackett said.",
      "But while he did not reach the Premier League again, he did manage to carve out a good career for himself. He helped Reading reach the Championship play-off final in 2017 before spending a season at Nottingham Forest. Blackett admits he enjoyed his time at the City Ground but the decision to leave was entirely his own.",
      "\"When I was there, it was like 15 players coming in during the summer and all changed every transfer window whereas now it is more the managers that are chopping and changing,\" he said. \"A lot of choices in my career are all on me to be honest. Not managers. I chose to leave Forest.",
      "\"They didn’t want me to leave but I chose to leave because I wasn’t being looked at in such a way and I wanted to play more, didn’t like being sat on the bench and these kinds of things [but] it is another great club.\"",
      "A spell with FC Cincinnati in the MLS followed for Blackett in 2021 and 2022. He admitted he was sceptical about moving to America at first but that the league's quality surprised him.",
      "\"I enjoyed it here and I think they are playing at a really good level here,\" Blackett said from an American gym that he trains at regularly.",
      "\"There are some really top players over here. I think when they really get it to a point where they want it, it will be one of the best leagues in the world, if it is not considered that already.",
      "\"When you actually get here and you see the amount of South American players that are playing in the league and good American players, and there are players from Europe [too] so it has a really good mix and really good feel to it and a lot of quality to it also.\"",
      "Blackett has now been a free agent for nearly a year and a half. He returned to England to play for Rotherham United but chose to leave the Millers at the end of the 2023/24 season following their relegation to League One. While some may have chosen to re-sign or look for a club down the footballing pyramid, Blackett remains confident in his own abilities to wait for the right opportunity.",
      "\"For myself, I played Premier League and Championship in England,\" Blackett said. \"They are the only levels that I have played at and I believe in the quality and what I have.",
      "\"That’s the player that I am, I am at around that level. I didn’t want to go down into League One, League Two because I believe that I should be higher than that.",
      "\"At the time when I was playing at Rotherham, when I got injured, I was in the top five defenders in the league in terms of the stats and all that type of stuff, I was doing well and then obviously the injury happened.",
      "\"From that, I thought I should have gone to another Championship team and continued but it just never came.",
      "\"I think everything that happened with me, happened at a difficult point. The two injuries which kept me out for pretty much a year and then I had just turned 30 so in a lot of eyes in football, once you turn 30-years-old, they look a bit different at you.",
      "\"And yeah I was out of contract at that point too so it was kind of like everything happened at that one point and clubs stopped looking and I didn’t want to accept that I should go and play in League One.",
      "My kids and my fiancee are over here [in America], I am staying around and being the family man while I am doing my training and waiting for something else to happen.",
      "\"I am still in hope that there is something more for me so I can continue and play how I know I can play, but at the same point I don’t want to hang on and keep waiting, I am going to get on with my life, keep going and if something comes then great, I will get back to it and have the same focus as I always did.\"",

      "Marcus Rashford has reminded Manchester United what they're missing out on – again. The 28-year-old forward, who joined Barcelona on loan in the summer, fired the Spanish champions to a 3-1 win over Elche at the Estadi Olímpic Lluís Companys on Sunday night.",
      "Lamine Yamal broke the deadlock inside the opening minutes, curling the ball into the top left-hand corner from close range. Ferran Torres doubled Barcelona's lead a few moments later, latching onto a cross from Fermin Lopez.",
      "Rafa Mir pulled one back for the visitors shortly before the break, but Rashford put the third and final nail in the Elche coffin in the second half. Rather than cutting onto his right foot, the United loanee darted towards the by-line and unleashed a ferocious strike on his left.",
      "Rashford struck the underside of the crossbar to secure Hansi Flick's side all three points. The England international, who has been superb for Barcelona this season, has now scored six goals and provided seven assists across all competitions.",
      "Speaking to Spanish outlet Mundo Deportivo after the game, Rashford reflected on his performance. The United loanee said: \"I try to give my best. I could have done better against Elche, and I promise to improve because I'm not entirely happy with my performance overall.\"",
      "Rashford added: \"We work hard to win. We're taking it one game at a time. We need to keep playing as a team. This is Barca, and the demands must always be at their highest.\"",
      "Meanwhile, Torres said: \"Perhaps we haven't been as accurate in some plays as we should have been. We've found the spirit and the intensity. I think we're finding the Barca of last season, when we devoured the pitch from the start.",
      "\"We needed to recover the joy of playing,\" added the former Manchester City forward. \"We saw during the week that they were going to play a man-to-man game, and we prepared for that.",
      "\"We were coming off a defeat, and we needed to win here, in our stadium and in front of our fans.\"",
      "On his goal, which happened to be his 50th for the club, Torres said: \"I'm very happy to have scored. I try to help the team. I didn't know that, but I'm very happy. Many more goals will come!\"",
      "The Spain international dedicated his strike to the victims of the floods in Valencia last year. Torres said: \"It's been a difficult week, and we can't forget the people affected in Valencia, so I wanted to send them a message of solidarity and support through this goal.\"",
      "If Barcelona do not activate the option-to-buy clause, which is said to be £28m, and Rashford returns to United, Bryan Robson believes the loanee will need to change his attitude.",
      "Speaking to Grosvenor Casinos, the Reds legend said: \"Marcus is a great talent and everything, but I do think his attitude's got to change if he does come back to United.",
      "\"Marcus is a great talent and everything, but I do think his attitude's got to change if he does come back to United. Barcelona is different because we always know that Barcelona and Real Madrid are going to be dominant in their league.",
      "\"So for a player like Marcus playing with the top players like Barcelona have, he will improve and he will start enjoying his football a little bit better if he were to come back to United.",
      "\"I can't believe that people say that he's enjoying the two clubs that he left us for and that you can't enjoy your football at Man United. That seems crazy to me.\"",

      "Former Premier League referee Keith Hackett has insisted that Manchester United were fortunate not to concede a late penalty in Saturday's 2-2 draw with Nottingham Forest.",
      "Ruben Amorim's men extended their unbeaten run after coming from behind to leave the City Ground with a point. After Casemiro put them ahead in the first-half, Forest went ahead through Morgan Gibbs-White and Nicolo Savona before Amad's strike in the 81st minute levelled the scoring.",
      "With the score still 2-1 and United pushing for a equaliser, Forest fans were left fuming when referee Darren England decided against awarding them a penalty. Ryan Yates' flick-on from a corner accidently hit Amad's arm after he mistimed his jump to head away.",
      "Despite protests from supporters and players, England opted not to point to the spot and United eventually equalised. The Premier League Match Centre account on X did not explain why the video assistant referee (VAR) decided not to intervene.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "However, Hackett has insisted the decision was wrong, labelling the incident a \"clear handball offence\" in a post on X. It was the second controversial call that went against Forest after Sean Dyche was left furious with the way United's first goal occurred.",
      "The Forest boss was left angry that a corner was given in the build-up to Casemiro's opener. Savona looked to have kept the ball in play but the assistant on the far side flagged for a corner.",
      "“I just can’t understand it, you’re an assistant referee and 70-odd yards away, you’ve got a goal and a net in the way, but apparently you can see,” Dyche said.",
      "“I’ve got a better view and I’m not in the right position. That’s got to be wrong in the current climate. I’m a big fan of VAR. Someone has got to be able to overrule these decisions, just really quickly, [it would take] only five seconds.",
      "“For me, that’s five seconds of VAR: ‘Bang, that’s it, done, wrong decision.’ It is really, really frustrating two weeks on the trot. With all the technology and all that’s at stake, particularly for us at Nottingham Forest after the start the club has had, that’s a big moment.",
      "“We all want it right, every fan wants it right. The worst thing, I’m back in the game for three games and for two weeks on the trot I’m talking about refereeing decisions. I want to be talking about my team.”",

      "Marcus Rashford's Premier League debut is a well-documented story - it happened just three days after his maiden senior outing for the club. Yet, the tale of another academy product who also made his bow that day remains largely untold.",
      "Whilst Louis van Gaal handed a second opportunity to a youthful Rashford, who had featured in a Europa League clash against FC Midtjylland 72 hours previously, James Weir was grappling with his own anxiety.",
      "Manchester United were ahead 3-2 against Arsenal, courtesy of a brace from Rashford - taking his tally to four goals in fewer than 150 senior minutes for the club - when Van Gaal turned to his substitutes.",
      "Despite having alternative choices available, Van Gaal selected midfielder Weir. Ander Herrera, who was booked and had found the net, was withdrawn for Weir, signalling his debut and sole outing for the senior squad.",
      "His stint with United proved brief, departing for Hull merely six months afterwards, where he battled fitness problems and received limited opportunities.",
      "Although he skippered the Under-21s team at Carrington to championship glory, he never secured another chance at elite level, missing Hull's complete campaign before their demotion. At only 28 years old, he hung up his boots following spells at Wigan and Bolton, plus overseas ventures with MTK Budapest, FC ViOn, and Pohronie.",
      "Weir continues to remember the campaign when he featured in first-team duties at United. \"I was on the bench for about 10 games,\" he told the Guardian. \"It was a bit of a whirlwind – it feels like a lifetime ago.",
      "\"My debut was an out‐of-body experience but they were the best moments of my career. Being in the squad and exposed to a club that size was incredible. I wouldn't change that minute for anything.\"",
      "During a previous conversation with Planet Football, he expanded on his fleeting appearance. \"Usually, you start warming up after 25 minutes or go for a little run to get the manager's attention, but it was different with Van Gaal,\" he clarified.",
      "\"You had to wait until he told you to warm up, which meant he was then likely to send you on. After about 75 or 80 minutes he told me to warm up and then someone shouted down the touchline to me to come back to the technical area. I was thinking, 'Blimey, I am going to come on here'.",
      "\"My parents were there, but the whole thing was so quick – the adrenaline saw me through and I can't remember much about it, apart from standing with Timothy Fosu-Mensah and Paddy McNair at the final whistle, trying to take it all in.\"",
      "Looking back on his brief but unforgettable stint in the Premier League with Manchester United, the player shared his feelings with a blend of pride and wit, remarking: \"I can tell my children and grandchildren that I played for Manchester United in the Premier League – although I may not mention the one-minute bit!\".",
      "\"I came on for Herrera and he came up to me and said 'fight!' It was typical of him. I remember that clearly. In terms of the coaches, I think it was more just 'don't mess up'.",
      "\"Ander was a good guy. He was all emotion and passion, there was no holding back.\"",
      "The bizarre scenes involving manager Louis van Gaal's antics weren't forgotten either, as he recalled: \"It was a crazy day, Van Gaal did that impression of Alexis Sanchez on the touchline [when he fell to the ground]. I was warming up at the time, I thought a fight was going on or something, I only saw it afterwards.\"",
      "Discussing fellow Red Rashford, he revealed his personal bond with the striker and witnessed his remarkable ascent: \"For Marcus to score twice was surreal really. It made the day even more special. I was a bit older than him, but we were in the same digs together for a couple of years. We used to play FIFA together and go out for food, but I didn't play with him too much as I was a bit older than him.",
      "\"When he got to the reserves we had a couple of games, but he was straight through to the first team really. He missed that period because we had no strikers at the time, he went on to take his chance and the rest is history. We all knew he was the top one in his age group and that he was always destined to reach pretty good heights.\"",
      "Weir's academy squad boasted a wealth of promising talent, featuring players such as Pereira, Will Keane, Tyler Blackett, and Dean Henderson. He also shared the turf with established stars including Wayne Rooney, Michael Carrick, Scott McTominay, Jesse Lingard and Antonio Valencia during his time there.",
      "Nevertheless, Weir has now decided to retire from football and embark on a fresh path as a travel agent. Speaking to The Guardian, he revealed: \"I can still play football at some level but playing at a professional level day in and day out, my body didn't have that. It was not worth the sacrifice of living away anymore. I thought I needed to cut the cord early and move on to something else.\"",

      "Manchester United would have every right to feel disappointed to only come away from their trip to Nottingham Forest with a point.",
      "The Reds didn't have to get out of second gear to control the game in the opening 45 minutes, and had they produced anything like their best in the second half they would have cruised to three points.",
      "Yet they should be applauded for avoiding defeat having been a goal behind in the 81st minute. United sides of the not-too-distant past would have lost that game, as much for their inability to score goals as their lack of character.",
      "United have quietly gone about becoming one of the most prolific sides in the Premier League, with their tally of 17 goals scored in 10 games just five goals shy of half of their entire tally from the 2024/25 season.",
      "Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo have played a huge part in sharpening one of the league's bluntest attacks, and while we're still waiting for Benjamin Sesko to hit his stride, there have been more than a few flashes of promise.",
      "With just a quarter of an hour played at the City Ground on Saturday, the United striker was fed the ball by Matheus Cunha 20 yards from goal and instinctively swivelled and fired a shot a couple of yards wide of Matz Sels' goal. The Forest goalkeeper committed to the dive but the shot was always sailing narrowly wide.",
      "Bereft of support and with his back to goal, there seemed to be nothing on for the Slovenian when he collected the ball and it was a half chance fashioned from very little. While the effort failed to change the scoreboard it was an encouraging glimpse of what he can offer United moving forward.",
      "Let's not forget that Sesko isn't exactly a striker brimming with confidence right now. He may have broken his United duck against Brentford and followed it up with a goal against Sunderland to make it two in two, but he has scored just two goals in 10 league outings and was benched for United's best performance of the season. Yet his effort in the early stages at the City Ground was one of a player who had plenty of confidence in his own ability.",
      "Compare that to Rasmus Hojlund. The Dane's effort and endeavour at United could not be questioned, but his quality and ability to create chances out of nothing certainly could.",
      "As United struggled to create chances they needed their £72million striker to provide a spark, yet far too often he was found wanting and even when chances were served on a plate to him he would be caught on his heels.",
      "The additions of Cunha and Mbeumo mean United are stacked with creative talent. While all strikers need good service to thrive, it's been a long time since United had a player at the tip of their attack capable of pulling a rabbit out of a hat and catching a defence off-guard.",
      "In Sesko they might just have a striker who can add another weapon to their attacking arsenal.",
      "Ross joined the MEN in August 2021. He was appointed Sport Content Editor in February 2022 and became Head of Football in August 2024.",

      "With the Midlands side now searching for a new manager, two familiar faces to Manchester United fans have emerged among the early contenders.",

      "The Dutchman previously managed United for over two years, overseeing 128 games and guiding the Reds to both the FA Cup and Carabao Cup during his tenure.",
      "Solskjaer has also been linked with the vacancy. The former United striker was sacked from Turkish side Besiktas only a couple of months ago after a short and turbulent spell in charge.",
      "Solskjaer spent nearly three years as United manager, coming closest to silverware in 2021 when his side lost the Europa League final to Villarreal in a dramatic penalty shootout.",
      "Both managers experienced mixed fortunes at Old Trafford, and despite Solskjaer overseeing 40 more matches than Ten Hag, their win percentages remain remarkably close. 54.69% for the Dutchman and 54.17% for the Norwegian.",

Just to come back to this particular player, obviously a legend, a big player of the game who inspired so many, I can say only positive things, but I feel that comment is just I would say it's a bit of a lazy criticism.",

It's easy to blame the older players but he knows obviously as well as everyone else we do it together trying to help each and every one of us to try to get out of this and, like I said as well, last year when things go well you don't hear that at all. It is what it is.",

      "Onana began the season as back-up to Altay Bayindir after suffering an injury during pre-season. The Cameroonian was given his chance to impress against Grimsby Town but a poor performance sealed his fate at Old Trafford.",
      "On deadline day, Senne Lammens joined United and after the window closed, the Reds took advantage of Turkey's extended market to allow Onana to leave on loan. The deal with Trabzonspor is a straight loan switch with no option to buy, but the goalkeeper has impressed his new club.",
      "He has not lost a game since his debut against Fenerbahce and has kept two clean sheets in his last three appearances. In an interview with Sporx this week, Onana spoke confidentally about his style of play and attitude towards being a goalkeeper.",
      "\"I never fear anyone. Because in this life, I only fear God,\" he explained.",
      "\"Therefore, to be honest, no one can scare me. For me, most of the time, the important thing is to try to do what's best for the team.",
      "\"If I need to play out from the back, I first analyse. Is the opponent pressing? Are they pressing with the winger, the striker, or are their centre-backs stepping up? These are the things I need to see when the ball is at my feet.",
      "\"I track how the opponent moves and look at the options before making my decision.\" United fans would argue that Onana did not distribute the ball as well as was expected during his time at the Theatre of Dreams, but the 29-year-old refuses to see that as a failure.",
      "\"Looking back, my career has really been amazing,\" he continued. \"There have been many ups and downs in this process, but that also meant a lot of learning moments, a lot of experiences.",

      "The Premier League have confirmed that Darren England will referee Manchester United's Premier League clash against Nottingham Forest, his first fixture including the Reds since he sent Patrick Dorgu off last season.",
      "Dorgu was shown a straight red card in United's 3-2 win over Ipswich Town in February after a high challenge on Omari Hutchinson. The £25million signing got a slight touch on the ball but followed through and caught his opponent late on the top of the shin.",
      "He was initially given a yellow card before England was advised by VAR to review the incident on the pitch-side monitor. After a brief check, the decision was overturned and Dorgu was sent off.",
      "At the time, England was seen explaining the decision before brandishing the red card and former PGMOL chief and ex-FIFA referee Keith Hackett admitted that it opened the referee up to backlash.",
      "\"The red card issued by Darren England is correct, this is a challenge with excessive force, that endangers the safety of his opponent,\" he told Football Insider. \"Frankly, [when refereeing myself] I monitored the player leaving the field of play without engaging in any discussion, it is easy in the heat of the situation to be accused of saying something.",
      "\"You should monitor for sure, but there is no point of explaining why the player is being sent off, it is pretty obvious when you make a challenge with such force.”",
      "This week, the Premier League have announced their match officials appointments for the weekend's action and England will be in charge for United's trip to the City Ground. Scott Ledger and Akil Howson will be his assistants, with Bobby Madley joining the managers in the technical area.",

      "United made it three wins on the spin on Saturday as they beat Brighton and Hove Albion 4-2 at Old Trafford. The players who were unused substitutes against the Seagulls or played limited minutes at the weekend took part in Sunday's training session, as did a number of academy players who were called up to boost the numbers.",
      "The club have released a short video of the training session and MEN Sport picked out three key points from the workout.",
      "Before Brighton, Amorim confirmed that Mason Mount was a doubt for the fixture, which instantly caused concern given his track record with injuries.",
      "He managed to be fit enough for a place on the bench but was not risked against the Seagulls. He took part in Sunday's training session and looked to be moving freely as he aims to regain his place in the team on Saturday.",
      "As the current back-up goalkeeper, Altay Bayindir was involved in the session along with Tom Heaton. The Turkish goalkeeper took part in a small-sided game with the outfield players.",
      "While United have looked to be more direct with Senne Lammens in goal, being able to play out from the back is still a big part of modern-day football, and Bayindir is clearly keen to get the practice in with his feet.",
      "Harry Maguire was not spotted participating in the session having missed the win over Brighton through injury.",
      "Amorim said before that game that he hoped to have Maguire back this week, but there was no sign of him in the footage released by the club. It may be that he was just not picked up by the cameras, but Amorim will hope he's available for the weekend.",

      "Manchester United winger Marcus Rashford is enjoying a career revival at Barcelona.",
      "When he left Aston Villa at the end of last season, Rashford's career was at a crossroads. Yes, his performances at the West Midlands club were improving, but he was still some way off his best, leading to questions over which Rashford we would see the following season.",
      "To Barcelona's credit, they took a gamble despite the warning signs. Now, it seems that gamble is paying off.",
      "Last week saw Rashford grab a brace and an assist in the 6-1 thrashing of Olympiacos. He followed that up with an assist in El Clasico and while Barcelona lost to Real Madrid, it was another milestone on Rashford's journey back to top form. Rashford now has five goals and seven assists for the Catalan club in 13 appearances.",
      "Plenty of United supporters will see Rashford's numbers and wonder whether there is a scenario whereby he returns to Old Trafford. Unfortunately for them, it feels like that is impossible and his recent comments confirm just that.",
      "Speaking before the clash with Real Madrid, Rashford told ESPN: \"It was so many years in one place. People forget this, but 24 years, 23 years of my life was with Manchester United. So sometimes you just need a change.",
      "\"I think maybe this is the case with me and yeah, I'm enjoying everything.\"",
      "Rashford is benefitting from a change of scenery, culture and team. It is not a case that the 27-year-old has suddenly been relieved of all pressure, because United and Barca are comparable on that front.",
      "But in England he was under the spotlight daily and, in a struggling side, he was expected to be the main man. Eyes aren't always on Rashford to be the key man in Barcelona.",
      "United and Rashford will always be linked but that chapter is now closed.",

      "Matthijs de Ligt urged his Manchester United teammates to cut out mistakes and take responsibility when he spoke after the disappointing Brentford defeat in September.",
      "United suffered a big setback at the Gtech Community Stadium. Ruben Amorim's future subsequently dominated headlines, but Amorim has enjoyed an October to remember.",
      "Amorim must be in contention to win manager of the month after impressive wins against Sunderland, Liverpool and Brighton, which have seen United climb up to sixth in the table.",
      "So what has been the difference? Amorim has made a few tweaks. Senne Lammens made his debut against Sunderland before the international break and the goalkeeper punted most of his goal kicks long.",
      "Benjamin Sesko was found regularly by Lammens and speaking after the victory, Mason Mount said about the goalkeeper's impressive impact: \"It was a solid performance. Any danger of them pressing, he puts it into Ben [Sesko] and we work off that. I think he kind of released the pressure a lot.\"",
      "Amorim hinted that supporters could see the same against Liverpool. \"I think if you look at nowadays, every time the ball goes to the goalkeeper, most of the teams play man-to-man,\" he said.",
      "\"Sometimes you don't have anyone to play and you try to use the first ball with the second ball and try to win. When you have players with a lot of power in front and now we have it. If we win one second ball, we can take all that build-up from the game and have the opportunity to score.",
      "\"I think everyone is doing that. Senne has one ability that is really good. He can play with both feet. It's harder for the opponents to try to make the pressure from one side or the other.",
      "\"They know that he can kick the ball with both feet and I think that is really important. But he also needs to be ready. People are seeing the games. Understanding that it takes a little bit of time to choose.",
      "\"He needs to be ready for the Premier League. It's something that you use if it's man-to-man in front. You are not building up. You can put the ball in one against one up front and that is the play.\"",
      "Arne Slot complained about United's effective approach, but Amorim refused to respond to the comments from the Liverpool manager. \"Liverpool is in the past, I don’t want to comment,\" he said last Friday.",
      "\"It is not important, it is important what Fabian [Hurzeler] said - to try to understand what is going to happen [against Brighton]. I understand everything, I am really pleased that the team can play different games.",
      "\"It was an important win but I was the first one to say we need to play better with the ball. I don’t care what Slot is saying, what people are saying about our team.",
      "\"I can watch the game and say we can do better and we need to do better in the future but sometimes you need to adapt to the game. So I don’t need anyone to evaluate my team. I can evaluate my team and I am really clear that we should play better with the ball and we are going to try to do that in this game.\"",
      "United have gained confidence, helping the back-three to push up to squeeze the opponent more aggressively. \"That was the plan [defenders pressing with aggression],\" said Amorim after Brighton. \"When we have Harry Maguire we can defend better our box so we can play a little lower.",
      "\"But when you have players that can press high... Luke is not really tall, but he's fast and aggressive. We can press a little higher and we know if we win the ball we have players in front of the goal. They [United's attackers] are so good that we just need one chance when we win the ball.\"",
      "Amad has hit form after suffering from a family bereavement. The 23-year-old's understanding with Bryan Mbeumo has blossomed and the pair were crucial against Liverpool and Brighton.",
      "\"He's a working machine,\" said Amorim about Mbeumo. \"He's so good in transitions. He's improving when we are organising the final third. The connection with Amad is really hard to beat these two guys because they change positions. They are really fast, they are good in one against one.\"",
      "The pieces have fallen into place and United are now officially an in-form team.",

      "Casemiro made a beeline for Ruud van Nistelrooy in the Old Trafford tunnel on his return with Leicester City in February.",
      "Van Nistelrooy, a fluent Spanish speaker, was the conduit between Casemiro and Erik ten Hag after his Portuguese-speaking assistant Mitchell van der Gaag left. Van Nistelrooy started Casemiro in all four of his matches as caretaker manager. Casemiro lingered as Van Nistelrooy spoke, as attached to him as a comfort blanket.",
      "At that time, Casemiro had not started for United in 39 days. He did not get a kick between December 30, the night of the Newcastle United debacle, and January 30. He emerged on 70 minutes in Bucharest with United 2-0 up. The transfer window was still open but the chances of United shifting Casemiro were, like the Trinity test igniting the atmosphere, near zero.",
      "People at United's Carrington training complex noticed Casemiro's personality never wavered during a trying first half of the season. They have always found him to be a warm presence.",
      "His transformation at United in the past two months has been as unexpected as their 3-0 triumph in Bilbao. This is the midfielder who was dropped for last year's FA Cup final and replaced by Toby Collyer with United 2-0 down to Liverpool at half-time eight months ago. Casemiro’s declaration that he was keen to see out his contract in March was framed as more bad news for the club.",
      "Casemiro used his head before Athletic lost theirs in San Mames. Returning to Spain emboldens Casemiro. In San Sebastián and Bilbao, he has reminded Spanish audiences he can still cut it nearly three years on from leaving their shores. United supporters serenaded Casemiro on Thursday night.",
      "The draw with Real Sociedad in mid-March has marked a late turning point in Casemiro's third season in Manchester. With Manuel Ugarte out injured, Ruben Amorim had little choice but to turn to the older defensive midfielder.",
      "Casemiro has since been a fixture in the United starting XI, his importance highlighted by the early withdrawal at Bournemouth last week to preserve him for Bilbao. Ugarte admitted this week he is copying him.",
      "Within a matter of months, Casemiro has gone from unsellable to undroppable. If or when United reach the Europa League final, Casemiro is a shoo-in in midfield. The 3-4-2-1 system Amorim swears by has closed the yawning gaps that developed between the defence and midfield under Ten Hag and Casemiro has the safety net of a third centre back.",
      "United have adjusted Casemiro’s running and pressing triggers. “I think he has improved a lot also,” Amorim opined. “You can see not the way he plays but the way he runs. You can see it, we have the data to show him where he worked really hard.",
      "“He is a very good example. Even Toby sometimes was playing in front of him and [that] it is hard to take for Casemiro. So it is a lesson for all the players in Manchester United.",
      "“No matter what is the past or the last month, everything can change in one moment. Then we understood that he cannot jump all the time pressing high. We need to let him understand and sometimes it is better to put three defenders and let him be the fourth defender and put the wing-backs pressing high. These are all things we are understanding and trying to cope with all the criticisms of the team. But the credit is for Casemiro.”",
      "Amorim has been impressed by how hard Casemiro has worked to meet his demands to regain his place in the team. He noticed that he never complained during those winter weeks warming the bench.",
      "Selflessness is a natural trait of Casemiro's. It was also his undoing this time last year. With United depleted at centre half, he dropped back and was humiliated in the 4-0 drubbing by Crystal Palace.",
      "With Kobbie Mainoo and Christian Eriksen a flimsy shield and Jonny Evans his creaking partner, Casemiro abandoned his position to engage Michael Olise, overcommitted, lost his balance and Olise scored. Six days later, he trundled out of the United third and played Arsenal winger Gabriel Martinelli onside to square for Leandro Trossard’s tap-in. Sofyan Amrabat was ushered back in from the cold and played his way into the FA Cup final XI.",
      "Jamie Carragher urged Casemiro to “leave the football before the football leaves you”. Casemiro had been pencilled in to flank Amorim for pre-match press duties against Athletic and he would be a worthy choice at Carrington next week. He is a positive story again and one of the squad’s figureheads. United view Casemiro as a quiet leader, mind.",
      "The 33-year-old shared Raphael Varane’s view that a “disconnect” had developed between the players and Ten Hag. It is not a coincidence that Casemiro scored two goals in the first game after Ten Hag was finally sacked. He was committed enough to claim the last goal of the Ten Hag era at West Ham.",
      "When Casemiro discussed the possibility of joining United, he wanted to know three things: where he would live, where he would train and where the stadium was. During FaceTime conversations, he requested to see the club’s gymnasium at Carrington.",
      "United sources have been struck by how leaner Casemiro is this season. People in Madrid said Casemiro used to be in the club's Valdebebas gym at 8am and he often has gym sessions before and after training at Carrington.",
      "Casemiro has struck up a close rapport with some of the masseurs and his English is now a very good level of conversational. He understood our questions in the mixed zone two years ago, when his handshake grip was as tight as a vice. Casemiro's wife, Anna, and children Sara and Caio, are happy in Manchester amid the prospect of a fourth year in England's north west.",
      "Staff at Carrington regard Casemiro as one of the most respectful players they have encountered and that he is strident in protecting the club's image. Sir Jim Ratcliffe dubbed Casemiro as \"overpaid\" and \"not good enough\" in March. Three days later, Casemiro trumped his first-leg performance against Sociedad in the 4-1 win at Old Trafford.",
      "His steep decline over 18 months - dropped for Amrabat, substituted for Collyer, omitted from the Brazil squad - makes Casemiro’s revival so singular. If United win the Europa League it would be churlish to argue someone who has won three trophies in three seasons has been an unsuccessful signing.",
      "Casemiro drove United to a successful 2022-23 season. Without him, they would not have qualified for the Champions League. Ten Hag dubbed him the “cement between the stones”, essentially the glue in the team. Casemiro was central to the Latino rebranding of the United defence that kept the most clean sheets in the Premier League.",
      "Casemiro has returned to that level of influence he wielded in his first season. In Europe, at least. The concern if United do not triumph in Bilbao again this month is Casemiro could be redundant in a campaign devoid of Champions League midweeks. His recent domestic form has been inoffensive but not stellar and United need a young and dynamic new central midfielder in the summer.",
      "The senior figures made the difference in Bilbao, though. Casemiro and Bruno Fernandes, two 30-something Portuguese speakers, are naturally close.",
      "“We've got a lot of senior players who need to step up in their moments,” Harry Maguire explained. “I think Case was brilliant tonight. Bruno as well. So we have senior players who need to handle these moments really well.”",
      "Van Nistelrooy, a champion of Casemiro’s, merits credit for that.",

      "Arsenal are running away with it on a tide of relentless competence, while the silliness literally everywhere else sees Tottenham in the top five despite having four points from five games at home, Bournemouth fourth despite selling all of their defenders in the summer, and newly promoted Sunderland sat looking down on two of the Big Six a quarter of the way through the season, just like everyone predicted.",
      "Manchester United’s redemption has taken Ruben Amorim out of immediate contention, with Vitor Pereira a clear frontrunner before Wolves decided to get rid on Sunday.",
      "That put Nuno Espirito Santo and West Ham in clear and present danger of both seeking their third appointment of the season already, but an excellent win against Newcastle buys some time there and leaves the fast-spinning finger of doom pointing now upon Daniel Farke at Leeds. It is literally impossible to keep up, but suffice to say there now really are only a very small handful of managers considered entirely safe.",
      "Meanwhile, here are possible replacement managers currently between jobs.",
      "",
      "An earlier version of this oft-updated piece speculated on what might happen to Mikel Arteta should Arsenal suffer from their Nightmare Start. What if they lost a few early games? What then? We concluded this:",
      "It’s far likelier that Arsenal emerge blinking into the autumn sunshine broadly unscathed from their nightmare horrors. No denying that this season does represent one in which Arteta might completely lose the plot and go entirely off the rails. Or the one where he wins the league by 10 points. Feels like we’re odds-on to get one or the other.",
      "Arsenal emerged duly unscathed, and have already cashed in on the shift to easier fixtures of their own alongside much tougher ones for Liverpool to take top spot in the Premier League.",
      "Only question that remains, therefore, is what Arsenal do from here. We are absolutely certain that it either involves p*ssing the league by 15 points or a complete and total meltdown. Nothing in between. We’re definitely leaning towards the former now, though.",
      "READ: Who will be the next manager of Arsenal if Mikel Arteta is sacked?",
      "",
      "Doing so well that even suffering the ultimate embarrassment of defeat at Old Trafford hasn’t dampened spirits for the most impressive promoted club in quite some time.",
      "Five wins in the bag already, a five-point lead over Newcastle with a game in hand, and more points than Southampton managed in the entirety of 24/25. It will very much do, and importantly provides a significant buffer for Le Bris and his team as they continue a tough little run of games.",
      "",
      "Won’t be sacked, obviously, because Palace are absolutely punching with an elite-level manager who is quietly delivering astonishing results in trying circumstances.",
      "But with reports he was willing and ready to walk out if Marc Guehi was sold without a replacement point to new strains on a relationship that is bound to be tested in the weeks and months ahead.",
      "Nailed it in the Community Shield, but as ever for clubs on Palace’s level there’s a positive-and-negative scale to be balanced by your manager catching the eye so conspicuously. Glasner absolutely could be poached with bigger beasts surely paying attention to the work he’s done at Selhurst Park.",
      "And if that poaching comes from outside the Premier League, then it comes with the possibility of making Glasner the next Premier League managerial casualty. But still very unlikely.",
      "We’d imagine the significant lowering of the threat level for a Ruben Amorim Sack at United has eased some nerves at Selhurst Park considerably.",
      "",
      "Among the least sackable managers in the top flight, and the only club we could really picture trying to lure him away this summer was Spurs and that’s now safely off the table.",
      "It was a difficult summer for Bournemouth but Iraola had masses of credit in the bank and the excellent start they’ve made despite everything is only strengthening his standing.",
      "",
      "A sacking remains out of the question despite last season’s (relative) struggles. There hasn’t been a Premier League manager since Fergie in his pomp with more credit in the bank than Pep.",
      "But is there still a distinct chance Guardiola decides he’s had enough and simply walks away? We reckon there is, and it’s always worth remembering that we’re talking Next Premier League Manager To Leave here, and that the traditional ‘Sack Race’ shorthand is a bit misleading.",
      "Still, though. Almost no chance at this point that any of that could happen swiftly enough for nobody else to have been canned first. Especially with even a currently not entirely convincing City perhaps remaining the only halfway plausible contenders should Arsenal suffer any kind of a wobble.",
      "",
      "Forget everything we ever wrote about Ruben Amorim being doomed; he has engineered a 2-1 win at Anfield and it’s now three wins in a row after a rollicking good fun 4-2 win over Brighton.",
      "A quite silly 2-2 draw was probably a bigger setback for that lad off the internet whose long-overdue haircut is once again as far away as ever than it was for Amorim, who was backed when things were going appallingly and isn’t about to get canned now they’re going really quite well.",
      "",
      "Funny old season for Emery already. Began the campaign right at the outside of this market with your Artetas and – unlikely as it now sounds – Slots. Then jumped right up to third favourite when Villa’s rankling disappointment at how last season ended leaked into a six-match winless start to this campaign.",
      "But then along came four Premier League wins in a row to thoroughly lift the mood at a club where a few short weeks ago it really did feel like they’d come to the end of something special without ever getting the definitive moment of success it deserved.",
      "Still feels like it could go either way, for club and manager, but that’s still significant progress on where they were a month ago when it felt far more certain. And not in a good way.",
      "",
      "At various points we’ve expended daft amounts of energy attempting to manifest a ‘Howe Sack’ crisis because we’re messy bitches who live for drama. But we’ve never managed to make it stick even a tiny bit and we started the summer thinking there was little imminent prospect of going for it again with Howe the hero of the Geordie Nation for delivering silverware and more lovely, lovely Champions League football.",
      "Now, though, after a traumatic summer and the Alexander Isak Saga and a sometimes iffy start to the season, our Spidey Sense is tingling once more. Currently five points outside a largely daft top eight, and that won’t do, no matter what the mitigation.",
      "",
      "Things would have to go unbelievably wrong unbelievably fast, but this is Everton so, you know. Maybe. And there are few things that straddle the blessing-curse divide in football quite like a new stadium.",
      "The benefits Everton should accrue come in the long term. In the short term there’s the loss of familiarity and – something that feels specifically important in this particular case – atmosphere while everyone gets used to the new surroundings.",
      "Defeat at Leeds on the opening weekend was distinctly squibbish, but Everton have bounced back in some style since to suggest they could not just survive but thrive. With Jack Grealish in impish early-season form, they might even be fun. Ending Crystal Palace’s unbeaten run in such dramatic circumstances was certainly that. Consecutive defeats without scoring against Man City and Spurs not so much.",
      "",
      "It is still very early days and still too early to tell which way a promising-but-not-flawless start eventually breaks for Frank and Spurs.",
      "He arrived to a club and squad with an awful lot of mess to sort out at history’s funniest ever Champions League qualifiers. He appeared to have already thoroughly De-Anged the lot of them only for them to then turn up against Bournemouth and defend like an Ange team while attacking like a Mourinho one.",
      "You know who else won their first couple of games, including one against Man City, after stepping up to Spurs from a smaller but less daft Premier League club? That’s right. But while the Nuno comparisons are obvious, and a world in which Frank doesn’t make the November international break entirely possible, it doesn’t quite feel like the same situation.",
      "Crucially, there was no undignified scramble to find a new manager this time. Whatever your thoughts on the timing and manner of Ange Postecoglou’s sacking and the identity of his replacement, it’s also clear Spurs have got the man they wanted in a way they very obviously didn’t when Nuno came in.",
      "That surely buys Frank a bit of time even if things do get hairy, which they will if that abysmal home form (three wins from 19 Premier League games, and just one from five very winnable ones this season) can’t be sorted out. The absolute state of that moribund defeat to Chelsea raises the stakes. Feels like a really big week for Frank now with key home games in Europe and the Premier League to come before the interlull.",
      "",
      "One of the key early-season imponderables for 25/26 was just how big and what kind of impact the Club World Cup might have on the way Chelsea and Man City start the season. Would they hit the ground running, or would they be a bit tired and out of sorts? For both, it’s been a little from column A, a little from column B.",
      "He definitely still has some hearts and minds to win at Chelsea despite the fine finish to the season that saw them tick off Champions League qualification while completing their collection of UEFA pots and pans and then winning the actual Club World Cup.",
      "A home draw with Crystal Palace wasn’t ideal, but the paddling dished out to West Ham has what really should at least be some kind of halfway credible title bid up and running at least. And we strongly suspect Fulham won’t be the last team left scratching their head after losing to Maresca.",
      "There was some talk of ‘Maresca out’ after a draw with Brentford but that was surely only a minority view. After losing to Manchester United in shambolic fashion, there were more on the bandwagon.",
      "That win over Liverpool was big, though, and a particularly good one for Maresca himself. The second half thumping of Forest was handy, too, albeit inevitably saying far more of their opponents than it did of Chelsea. Home defeat to Sunderland saw awkward questions resurfacing, and he’ll have been enormously grateful Spurs were so thoroughly wretched on Saturday evening.",
      "",
      "Fine end to 24/25 put a different complexion on Brighton’s season than at one time appeared likely. Ending up a clear best of the rest outside the quickly established top seven represented at least a passing grade and they’d have to make a truly awful start to the season to get in any kind of managerial-change bother.",
      "The win over Newcastle to go with victory at Chelsea to go with a win over City reaffirms Brighton’s big-boy-bothering calibre, but does also make some of their other results – draws with Fulham and Wolves, for instance – a bit annoying. Beating three of the previous season’s top five in your first eight games and still being only 10th in the table after 10 games feels a little bit silly.",
      "",
      "The continuity candidate in the summer, and looked to have received the ultimate hospital pass. How much continuity could there be at Brentford given they’d sold Bryan Mbeumo, Yoane Wissa and Christian Norgaard, while Thomas Frank took most of the remaining coaching staff with him to Tottenham? It was a very Brentford move to promote from within and we’ll hold our hands up and admit we thought it would go far, far worse than it has.",
      "With Liverpool added to Manchester United on the list of Gtech victims this season, it’s an undeniably impressive start in trying circumstances.",
      "",
      "The mini-crisis reached full-blown levels before Saturday’s much-needed win over Aston Villa, and the uncomfortable truth is that Slot has reacted poorly. He went Full Klopp with his salty loser behaviour when Manchester United committed the crime of altering their tactics to give themselves the best chance of success against Liverpool, and the headloss continued after another chaotic and unstructured performance led to a 3-2 defeat at Brentford.",
      "Having ticked ‘opposition doing tactics wrong’ off his rattled manager bingo card, he can now add ‘losing his mind over entirely uncontroversial refereeing decisions’ with his response to both the Cody Gakpo non-penalty and Virgil van Dijk penalty at the Gtech.",
      "It has to be a worry for Liverpool that Slot has for the first time in his Anfield career found himself under any kind of pressure after this chastening run of defeats, and has suffered severe and instant headloss as a result.",
      "It was six defeats in the last seven games, and five straight losses in domestic competitions before they stopped the rot against Villa. It was a result that really was sorely needed to prevent the genuine possibility of something truly extraordinary happening to a man who sauntered so impressively to the Premier League title in his very first season.",
      "",
      "Burnley really did have a horrible fixture list in these opening weeks under a manager with a horrible record at this level, and were given an opening-day reminder by the team that finished 17th last season of just how much harder the ‘simply don’t concede any goals at all’ tactic might be to deploy in the Premier League.",
      "Essentially, Burnley have got back to this level the same way Homer Simpson got to a heavyweight title fight. And Spurs and City have already given them a pummelling.",
      "Victories over Sunderland and Leeds were an impressive and necessary reminder that it might still be enough against teams more on their level, and while a 3-2 win at Wolves was not exactly The Burnley Way it’s still three points against an established – if struggling – Premier League side.",
      "This season is already a perfect reminder of just how much more fun the Premier League is when the promoted teams are capable of competing as all three are this season. We’re only just at one-quarter distance this season, and the three promoted teams already have over three-quarters of the total points last year’s miserable trio managed.",
      "",
      "That was a very, very good time to face Wolves, and Marco Silva took full advantage to end a losing run that was just beginning to tip him and Fulham towards trouble. We remain convinced of this: Fulham and Silva are both better off with each other than without, and both parties would do well to pause before thinking of doing anything rash.",
      "",
      "Won his first game in charge against Porto in the Europa, and Forest played rather well too. But it’s the Premier League where Dyche will and must be judged, with getting out of relegation trouble the most obvious of primary targets. And losing as they did against Bournemouth means it’s already quite possible to imagine the calm and thoughtful Mr Marinakis being forced into another calm and thoughtful decision about a manager he’s just appointed despite a decent point against resurgent Manchester United.",
      "",
      "As a rule of thumb, you really don’t ever want to be this prominent in the Sack Race this early in the season in what is already your second job of that season. It really has been an extraordinary few months for a manager who has already this season watched his Forest side tear Brentford apart, then watched his Forest side be torn apart by West Ham, and then watched his West Ham side torn apart by Brentford.",
      "Though Nuno would be way down any list of people to blame for the Hammers’ incompetence, he desperately needed a statement performance and result to suggest he might be in possession of possible solutions. The win against Newcastle provided exactly that and surely buys him some time at least.",
      "",
      "It would have made Spurs’ decision to sack Europa League-winning Ange Postecoglou look positively kind, but there remains a decent case that Leeds – and Burnley for that matter – could or even should have thanked the managers who secured 100 Championship points and got them back into the big time and then sent them on their way.",
      "Farke had a dreadful Premier League record of only six wins and 26 points from his 49 games in charge of Norwich, a team he twice led to promotion from the Championship with 94 and 97 points.",
      "As well as fighting his own record in this competition, Farke faces the added burden of expectation levels very different to those at just about any other club that could possibly find itself promoted into the Premier League in this current era where that represents the most bittersweet of successes.",
      "Defeat at Burnley was honking, but bouncing back to win another six-pointer against West Ham eased the stress significantly before a paddling at Brighton and events elsewhere – including West Ham themselves – left Farke desperately short of immediate cover.",
      "Ruben Amorim has challenged a Manchester United to be “so much better” despite the fact he saved the Red Devils in their last Premier League match.",
      "Are Man Utd set for a return to the Champions League? A landmark decision by Ruben Amorim for Nottm Forest bodes well.",
      "A report has revealed just how close Roberto De Zerbi came to being named Man Utd boss and how Ruben Amorim wasn’t on the initial six-man shortlist.",
      "According to reports, head coach Ruben Amorim has informed one Manchester United star how he can become the “best in the world” in his position.",
      "Does the combination of Ruben Amorim implausibly righting the Man Utd ship while Liverpool plunge into crisis make October 2025 the best post-Fergie month of all?",
      "In a career where you can fail upwards, we’ve taken our best guess at where every Premier League boss will be come 2030."

      "United lost their three-game winning streak when they drew 2-2 in the league with Nottingham Forest. The Red Devils were 1-0 up at the end of the first half through a Casemiro goal.",
      "But Forest hit twice in the space of two minutes at the start of the second half two go ahead, and though United pulled it back through Amad Diallo with nine minutes of regular time left, securing the draw, they were unable to add a fourth win to their streak.",
      "There are suggestions that Amad’s goal was the best that will be scored all season – he struck the ball on the volley from the edge of the box and it sailed into the right side of the Forest net.",

      "Perhaps the best single month in post-Ferguson Manchester United history was enough to coax Jason Wilcox out from the shadows to reluctantly explain how the “clear plan” at Old Trafford was bearing fruit.",
      "The Director of Football shouldered a fraction of the public-facing responsibility Ruben Amorim carries every week, confirming a complete narrative volte-face for a club which had started the season with two wins from seven.",
      "It took just three consecutive victories for the complexion to transform, for the hierarchy to toot their own horn, for Manchester United to go from perennial crisis to Champions League-adjacent. When the bar is lowered towards the core of the actual earth by accepting finishing 15th, any and all positives are magnified.",
      "But as Wilcox said, one of the keys is to “not get too carried away when we win and not get too disappointed when we lose”. It remains to be seen quite what Manchester United do with a draw at Nottingham Forest in a game they should have won and could have lost.",
      "It instinctively feels far more like a point gained than two dropped. The Manchester United of last season would probably lose that game. There is clear development in the mentality and character required to go from a position of relative comfort to a sudden and total collapse.",
      "Casemiro scored from another Dyche-infuriating corner that never was and the visitors seemed in control. Forest had threatened but Luke Shaw in particular was excellent.",
      "Then half time happened. Forest scored twice within the restart as Manchester United crumbled under a couple of high crosses. Morgan Gibbs-White headed in the equaliser to finish a sublime move, before Nicolo Savona nipped in to capitalise on some haphazard defending.",
      "In those moments it is difficult to blame the manager; these were specifically individual player errors. Amad was weak in challenging Gibbs-White, and Diogo Dalot compounded playing Savona onside with reacting far too late to the danger. Amorim has deserved the blame for most of his 19 defeats in a year, but would have ranked far down the list of culprits for his 20th.",
      "That such finger-pointing was ultimately never needed is testament to the power of momentum. It swung so abruptly and violently in Forest’s favour at the start of the second half, but was also something Manchester United could harness once the shock wore off. While the winning streak is over, the confidence and conviction which came from it was evident in the final half an hour.",
      "Amad levelled with a stunning volley and almost secured a stirring win with another effort Murillo blocked on the line in stoppage time. But a chaotic draw in a game with 35 shots almost perfectly equally split between two flawed yet improving teams was a fair result on the balance of play.",
      "Manchester United are a work in progress – left wing-back is becoming a problem position and the expensive assortment of forwards signed this summer need to establish more consistency – but that progress is finally clear to see. A result and performance which won’t lead anyone to “get too carried away” nor “too disappointed” is no bad thing.",
      "READ NEXT: The five ‘right’ signings Manchester United should make after statement of intent",
      "Erling Haaland has been a Premier League player for barely three seasons but has already outscored a legion of legends and is firing Norway to the World Cup.",
      "Liverpool needed a helping hand and it arrived with a moment of ‘madness’ from Emi Martinez, who is beyond the realms of Gary Neville’s understanding.",
      "Being dropped should have been the worst part of the day for Xavi Simons. Then Spurs were forced to play the £51m signing who does not fit whatsoever.",
      "Everyone is getting worked up about Arsenal and ‘set-piece goals’. But how do we even define a ‘set-piece goal’ and more importantly does it even matter?",

      "But there were some positives for United, with Nedum Onuoha suggesting when they got the game back to 2-2 that they were far more positive than they’d have been in recent times.",
      "He said: “What we’re seeing from Manchester United is the sense of confidence from them. They weren’t flustered when they went 2-1 down and they will believe they can win this game now, which is something we wouldn’t have seen a few weeks ago.”"

      "Signing a dynamic midfielder for Ruben Amorim is at the top of INEOS’ 2026 plans, but Manchester United’s “genuine interest” in Conor Gallagher, as reported by Fabrizio Romano, is as underwhelming as it is baffling.",
      "Casemiro’s uptick in form – evidenced by United conceding just three goal with him on the pitch and 16 goals without him – has made the requirement for a new central midfielder feel less urgent than it was even a couple of weeks ago, but that remains the area of the squad the Old Trafford hierarchy want to strengthen as a priority.",
      "Director of Football Jason Wilcox insists recruitment will be focused on “the right players who are talented but also who can deal with the pressure”.",
      "“They have got to have the right character and be somebody who can bring something different to the team,” he added.",
      "And while Gallagher – who swapped Chelsea for Atletico Madrid for £34m in the summer of 2024 – unquestionably meets that first requirement and arguably the second too, it’s hard to imagine how he would get into Amorim’s team to make that difference.",
      "It’s claimed the Red Devils were interested in Gallagher as the summer transfer window was coming to a close having asked about the availability of Carlos Baleba and been told by Brighton he would cost them £100m.",
      "But Gallagher is no alternative for Baleba, Elliot Anderson or the other midfielders Man Utd have been linked with of late.",
      "He’s played just three of his 63 games for Atletico Madrid as the defensive midfielder Amorim covets and at Chelsea was far more regularly used in an attacking midfield role, with protection always afforded to him by Enzo Fernandez or Moises Caicedo. Gareth Southgate played him in that deep-lying role for England at the start of Euro 2024 and it was a disaster.",
      "And yet, according to Romano, Gallagher remains very much on United’s radar.",
      "“I told you several times that Man United want to add a midfielder, but in this moment to go for a very expensive midfielder in the January transfer window might be difficult,” Romano told CaughtOffside.",
      "“Players like (Carlos) Baleba maybe are not even available. Same for Angelo Stiller and then there could be opportunities – a name that Manchester United considered in the summer transfer window final days was Connor Gallagher from Atletico Madrid.",
      "“Conor Gallagher remains an option in case Atletico Madrid decide to open doors to a loan move. At the moment Gallagher is only focused on Atletico Madrid. Manchester United’s interest is genuine since August. But Gallagher is one of the options they have in case it could be an opportunity on loan, in case it can be a typical general deal.",

      "It would be an underwhelming signing. Gallagher was very good in a very bad Chelsea team before departing for La Liga, but he’s a workhorse; in the same ‘safe pair of hands’ category as Mason Mount. He’s started just four games for Atletico this season.",
      "There will be huge doubts as to whether he’s a player who can take Man Utd forward, but above all, questions as to how he would even get in their team.",

      "At times it looked like it wouldn’t happen, but Ruben Amorim has made it to a year in charge of Manchester United.",
      "After the sacking of Erik ten Hag, Man Utd announced on November 1 last year that Amorim would become their new head coach, starting work 10 days later once he finished his Sporting CP tenure. But it hasn’t been plain sailing for Amorim at Old Trafford since then.",
      "Only recently has the Portuguese tactician been able to steer United towards consecutive positive results in the Premier League. They finished 15th under his watch last season and simply have to keep improving from here.",
      "To give themselves a decent chance, they boosted their squad in the summer with a handful of new signings. But their work evolving Amorim’s squad isn’t yet complete.",
      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe has suggested Amorim will be given three years to prove himself, so if the co-owner keeps his word, the head coach will still be in situ this time next year too, ready to celebrate a second anniversary of his appointment.",
      "With two transfer windows to go before then, what might Man Utd’s best XI look like this time next year?",
      "Disappointed by the performances of Andre Onana, United faced a goalkeeping transfer dilemma this summer. Ultimately, they chose to look to the future and signed Lammens from Royal Antwerp.",
      "Amorim has been patient with the Belgian so far, but he is starting to look like his new first-choice goalkeeper ahead of Altay Bayindir.",
      "Next summer, United will need to work out what to do with Onana after his loan spell at Trabzonspor, but it’s unlikely they’d be reverting to him as a starter.",
      "As long as Lammens doesn’t make too many mistakes over the course of the season, he looks set to be entrusted with the regular starting duties in goal for the long term, having signed a contract until 2030.",
      "There could yet be scope for a more senior keeper to come in and replace him, with Bayindir then making way, but United will be managing their budget carefully and assessing what they’ve already got first.",
      "The defender that United hope will be one of their figureheads for many years, Yoro has been settling into a role on the right-hand side of a back three.",
      "After beating competition from Real Madrid to sign the Frenchman last year, United tied him down to a long-term contract until 2029.",
      "Comfortable on either side of the back three that Amorim favours, Yoro can carve out a defined future for himself on his more natural right-hand side.",
      "Despite joining United to link up with his former Ajax boss Erik ten Hag, De Ligt has become a cornerstone of Amorim’s lineups recently.",
      "Generally, the Dutch defender has been stationed as the central defender in the back three, not missing a minute so far this Premier League season.",
      "At the age of 26, the once highly-touted De Ligt is approaching what should be the prime of his career, and it seems as if he’s stabilising his form in time to enjoy it in a settled role with United.",
      "DON’T MISS – The 10 Erik ten Hag signings still at Man Utd and when they could leave",
      "Upgrading at left centre-back would be a luxury for United rather than a necessity, depending on how Lisandro Martinez recovers from his latest injury setback.",
      "He has every chance of fighting for his place, but it can’t be denied that a dream target for United remains Everton’s Jarrad Branthwaite.",
      "So far, they’ve failed to prise him away, with Everton securing him to a new contract in the summer. However, there will reportedly be a release clause active in 2026.",
      "The price will be high, but if United find it reasonable enough and can afford it, the pathway to their dream signing could finally be cleared.",
      "If Branthwaite is out of reach, though, Martinez will likely continue as the main left-sided centre-back.",
      "Although he can also be an option in behind the striker, Amad has gained more gametime as a right wing-back so far this season.",
      "While he’s definitely more ‘wing’ than ‘back’, he has the traits to make that role his own niche in Amorim’s system.",
      "Diogo Dalot or Noussair Mazraoui will likely still be around as more defensive options, but at the age of 23, Amad is ready to take the next steps up in his career and will be aiming to put the pressure on for regular starts by virtue of his performances.",
      "United are dreaming of a midfield transformation in 2026, with sources explaining their plan to sign two new players in the department – ideally one in January and one in the summer.",
      "The preference at first would be someone with Premier League experience, with the likes of Carlos Baleba and Elliot Anderson on the shortlist.",
      "But Baleba struggled to impress at Old Trafford when visiting with Brighton recently and Forest’s valuation of Anderson is extremely high.",
      "TEAMtalk’s Dean Jones recently named Crystal Palace’s Adam Wharton as the player suspected to be the preferred target for United as things stand, although he won’t be easy to buy either.",
      "One of the best English midfielders in the Premier League, Wharton originally hails from Lancashire and could return to the north west with United if they get their way.",
      "A player who can dictate the tempo like he can would be a major boost to Amorim’s midfield, where Manuel Ugarte is struggling to convince, Kobbie Mainoo is unfavoured and Casemiro isn’t getting any younger.",
      "The other midfielder United could face a serious dilemma over next year is their captain, Bruno Fernandes.",
      "The role Amorim has been using him in recently doesn’t get the best out of him, but on paper, he remains one of United’s best players – if not the best.",
      "Fernandes has vowed not to make a decision on his club future until after the World Cup, but there’s reportedly a clause in his contract that could lead to him leaving for a foreign club.",
      "Should United get their wish of signing a second midfielder, one candidate who has been heavily tipped for a move is Stuttgart’s Germany international, Stiller.",
      "Jason Wilcox is said to be driving United’s interest in the 24-year-old, who would be more likely to move next summer than in January.",
      "He won’t be too pricey, either, since his release clause will stand at around £35m.",
      "The left wing-back role is starting to stand out as one United could do with an upgrade in. If only they still had Alvaro Carreras…",
      "Patrick Dorgu was the first signing of the Amorim era but the step up from Lecce to Man Utd is substantial and the jury is still out on whether he’ll make it as a success.",
      "Come 2026, there could be scope for United to strengthen with a more senior left-back.",
      "Right now, it’s too early to nail down who the candidates could be. There have been links with Inter’s Federico Dimarco, but he wants to stay with his boyhood club.",
      "Someone else who’s been namechecked in the media is Fulham’s Antonee Robinson, who would bring some proven Premier League quality.",
      "That said, he will turn 29 next summer and still with two years of contract remaining, so it remains to be seen if United would still see him as an ideal profile.",
      "Their scouts will have to keep their eyes on which players emerge as standout left wing-backs over the course of the season before making a more informed decision.",
      "United transformed their attack this summer with three new signings who should set them up for the next few years.",
      "Of the new triple threat, the player who’s made the better early impression has been Mbeumo, who joined from Brentford to become the new right-sided attacking midfielder in Amorim’s 3-4-2-1 shape.",
      "From his first 10 games, Mbeumo has scored five goals for United. He’s still only 26, so if he can keep this up, he should be a threat over the coming years.",
      "Man Utd stars Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha, manager Ruben Amorim",
      "Operating alongside Mbeumo and in behind the main striker is Cunha, who has been more of a slow burner since his switch from Wolves.",
      "It took until his ninth appearance for Cunha to score his first goal for United, but now that he’s broken his duck, he’ll be aiming to make more of an impact.",
      "Like Mbeumo, Cunha arrived with Premier League experience and is 26 years old, expecting to spend his prime years at Old Trafford.",
      "United capped off their attacking rebuild by signing Sesko as their new centre-forward, deciding against going for a more experienced option.",
      "It’s now over to the Slovenian to showcase his worth and justify United’s decision to pick out a player with long-term potential up front, just as they tried with Rasmus Hojlund and Joshua Zirkzee before only to be underwhelmed.",
      "Sesko has only scored twice from his first 10 games for United, but time will be on his side to step up – and besides, he arrived on the back of better seasons than Hojlund or Zirkzee before their moves.",
      "If Sesko doesn’t hit the mark, there might be calls for United to sign a more proven goalscorer – in fact, they might need a reliable veteran to back him up anyway, moving Zirkzee on – but this season will be practically all his to solidify his status.",

      "A report has revealed just how close Roberto De Zerbi came to being named Manchester United boss and how Ruben Amorim wasn’t on the Red Devils’ initial six-man shortlist.",
      "Amorim is slowly starting to turn things around at Old Trafford, winning three Premier League games on the bounce to lift them above Liverpool and into sixth place in the table, having been on the verge of the sack for the majority of his Old Trafford career to that point having been appointed last November.",
      "He became the club’s priority candidate after Erik ten Hag’s poor start to last season, after the Dutchman was handed a contract extension on the back of winning the FA Cup.",
      "Co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe has since admitted it was a mistake to retain Ten Hag, and a report from The Athletic has detailed the process in that summer when he signed a new deal which saw the Man Utd chiefs scour the managerial market to identify a replacement, which very nearly saw De Zerbi take the reins at Old Trafford.",
      "It’s claimed their analysis of candidates at the time was focused on them ‘playing an attacking 4-3-3 system’ similar to the one used by Ten Hag, and there was ‘an emphasis on previous Premier League experience’.",
      "It led them to draw up a six-man shortlist featuring Thomas Tuchel, Mauricio Pochettino, Roberto De Zerbi, Thomas Frank, Marco Silva and Graham Potter.",
      "‘Informal contact was made with all of them’ but Tuchel and De Zerbi were ‘the prime candidates’, with Amorim not considered owing to his tactical system and lack of Premier League experience.",

Tuchel came across incredibly well, but no terms were agreed and the German wasn’t ready for the United job. He was to take a short break from football after a difficult time at Bayern Munich that led to him leaving that club only the previous month.",
      "‘So De Zerbi became the frontrunner, and financial terms were discussed with the Italian in line with what United felt was fair. Those terms were rejected, and the club chose not to improve them.’",
      "In the end, Man Utd stuck with Ten Hag having failed to agree terms with a manager they deemed suitable to take over at the time, before ripping up their blueprint following his poor start to the campaign and plumping for a man with no Premier League experience, who plays a completely different formation in Amorim.",

      "The 21-year-old has impressed in fits and starts over the past ten months, though he has dropped in the pecking order of late. He has come off the bench in Man Utd’s last three Premier League matches.",
      "Despite this, a new report from The Sun claims Amorim has given his full backing to Dorgu, who has been ‘told’ that he could become the ‘best left-back in the world’.",
      "This is said to be dependent on Dorgu learning from PSG standout Nuno Mendes, who previously worked with Amorim at Sporting Lisbon.",
      "The report also claims that Amorim is ‘obsessed’ with helping Dorgu reach his full potential, with it noted that three of the defender’s qualities are fuelling the head coach’s confidence.",
      "An ‘insider’ for The Sun said: ”Dorgu has had some ups and downs this season, but Amorim is fully behind him.",
      "“He believes Dorgu’s athleticism, skillset and mentality can make him United’s left back for the next ten years.",
      "“The goal is to make him more decisive in attack — more assists, more goals, more involvement in second balls — like what Amad gives them on the opposite flank.”",
      "They added: “They’ve even worked with him on covering the left side of central defence, the way Mendes sometimes does at PSG.",
      "“Amorim is obsessed with helping Dorgu reach that level as quickly as possible. He genuinely sees him as the next Nuno Mendes.”",
      "Wolves getting rid of Vitor Pereira leaves two joint-favourites in the Sack Race, though one manager is surely the most likely to go next…",
      "Ruben Amorim has challenged a Manchester United to be “so much better” despite the fact he saved the Red Devils in their last Premier League match.",
      "Are Man Utd set for a return to the Champions League? A landmark decision by Ruben Amorim for Nottm Forest bodes well.",
      "A report has revealed just how close Roberto De Zerbi came to being named Man Utd boss and how Ruben Amorim wasn’t on the initial six-man shortlist.",
      "Does the combination of Ruben Amorim implausibly righting the Man Utd ship while Liverpool plunge into crisis make October 2025 the best post-Fergie month of all?",
      "In a career where you can fail upwards, we’ve taken our best guess at where every Premier League boss will be come 2030."

      "Jason Wilcox has given himself a good old pat on the back for the excellent work he’s done in the transfer market now that things are going well for Manchester United.",
      "The Director of Football’s silence through the club’s struggles last season and at the start of the current campaign has been deafening. Ruben Amorim has cut a lonely figure, fronting up to continuous questions about his future, the quality of the squad and general state of a once great club.",
      "But now, on the back of three consecutive Premier League wins in October, which might just be the greatest Man Utd month since Sir Alex Ferguson retired, Wilcox is all too eager to hail the players he’s played a big hand in bringing to the club.",
      "Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo have provided energy and quality to the attack, while Benjamin Sesko looks as though he could be the real deal, though the jury is still be out on the striker. And Senne Lammens has been something of a revelation after coming into the team in recent weeks as the new No.1 goalkeeper.",
      "All four signings would be classed as hits rather than misses at this early stage of their Old Trafford careers, and Wilcox is delighted with the way they’ve settled at the club.",
      "He said: “Yeah the guys have settled in really, really quickly. I think especially when you look at Matheus and Bryan, they have played in the Premier League and they have lived in England, so there is a quicker transition.",
      "“I think for Benji and Senne, you look at their transition and they have transitioned really well. We are really pleased. They are two young players, two for the future, but they have settled in amazingly well.",
      "“They are all good guys, even from last summer’s window, they are top professionals, top players and we are really optimistic we are going in the right direction.",
      "“We have a clear plan. I am sure there are going to be bumps in the road but we have just got to make sure we stay calm irrespective of the noise outside.",
      "“I see the intensity, I am at training every day, I see the way that they train, the way they apply themselves, the way they communicate and get on with each other.",
      "“Like I say, when you lose football matches you are always going to be a little bit disappointed and especially at this club.”",
      "Wilcox then insisted that he, Amorim and the other Man Utd decision-makers aren’t about to rest on their laurels, aware of the need to bring in further talent to challenge for Champions League qualification and major trophies in the future.",

      "Arsenal are top of the Premier League after a summer of investment in their squad, including up to £63million spent on Viktor Gyokeres.",
      "Ornstein, a writer for The Athletic specialising in transfers, feels Mbappe would be an ideal signing for Arsenal to continue their progress under Mikel Arteta towards the top of the European game.",
      "When asked by our friends at Planet Football who he would sign if he was in Arteta shoes, Ornstein replied Mbappe.",
      "“It’s not about who they will sign, but who I think would fit in nicely,” he said.",
      "For Liverpool, Ornstein feels Arne Slot should move again for a player they almost signed in the summer.",
      "“Marc Guehi. They wanted to get him but didn’t manage to at the last-minute of transfer deadline day but it could happen in the future.”",
      "Indeed, Guehi was undergoing a medical as the clock ticked down to the deadline at the end of the summer window. But Crystal Palace felt unable to find a replacement in the limited time available so the Eagles pulled the plug on a £35million deal.",
      "Guehi, most likely, will go free at the end of the season but Liverpool are sure to have competition for the England defender, with Real Madrid among the clubs also interested in the Palace captain.",
      "Turning his attention to Chelsea, Ornstein feels the Blues should look to raid Real and take back the La Liga leaders’ goalkeeper.",
      "“Thibaut Courtois. He’s been there before but I think they could take a world-class goalkeeper.”",
      "Indeed they could. Chelsea have struggled to find a reliable stopper since selling Courtois to Real in 2018.",
      "The Belgian, however, left under a cloud after forcing through his move, which is just one of the reasons a return would be unlikely.",
      "Ornstein’s choice for Tottenham seems a more realistic piece of buisness.",
      "“Jarrad Branthwaite. They’ve been looking for a while to upgrade in the centre of the defence, they have looked at Branthwaite.",
      "“He’s been linked with a move away from Everton even though he’s signed a new contract and I guess he’s one to watch for many of the top clubs.”",
      "Ornstein also feels Manchester City should maintain their interest in a forward they were reported to be keen on during the summer.",
      "“Rodrygo, because they looked at him and if Savinho had left, they might have made a push for him. And I think it would be exciting to see Rodygo or even Vinicius Jr in the Premier League.”",
      "Lastly, turning his attention to Manchester United, Ornstein reckons the Red Devils should pursue again Carlos Beleba.",
      "“They want him, he wants them, Brighton do not want to let him go but we’ll see what the future holds.",
      "“They have to upgrade in the no.6 department. Ruben Amorim wants to, and that could help complete their rebuild.”",
      "Even though Casemiro appears to have rediscovered his mojo? Yes, because the Brazilian is out of contract in the summer and there’s no chance of United taking their option to extend for an extra season on the terms Sir Jim Ratcliffe is angry the club ever agreed to when they signed the midfielder from Real Madrid in 2022.",
      "🚨 Weekend football quiz from Planet Football: Arsenal wonderkids, Guti’s backheel, PL hat-tricks…",

      "There has been so much noise around Viktor Gyokeres this season.",
      "Is he good enough? Is he scoring enough? Is he doing enough?",
      "However, the Sweden striker has quietly been going about his business and at Burnley, he produced his best 45 minutes in an Arsenal shirt so far - before he was forced off at the break with a muscular injury.",
      "Gyokeres struck the opener from a corner as Mikel Arteta's side also improved on their league-leading set-piece goals tally before the striker's brilliant pass freed Leandro Trossard in the build up to Declan Rice's superb header.",
      "It was an all-action display that showed his strength, his power, his pace, and his instinct to be in the right place at the right time to score, which is what ultimately Arsenal bought him to the club to do.",
      "\"Everything,\" Mikel Arteta said when asked what impressed him about Gyokeres's display. \"His high press, his position and his touches. His threat in behind, the way he linked play, the way he gets us from these situations to transition moments. I think he was in a really good moment. It's a shame that he felt something.\"",
      "Gyokeres' injury will now be the concern for Arsenal - as will concerns over Martin Zubimendi, who was replaced in the second half.",
      "With Kai Havertz, Martin Odegaard, Noni Madueke and Gabriel Jesus still out after long-term injuries, the Gunners can't afford to lose much more quality, especially in the centre-forward position.Oliver Yew",
      "Sometimes this job is a real privilege. Watching Moises Caicedo up close was a real thrill - even the Tottenham fans would have to agree. This was a performance that showcased everything you want from a world-class midfielder. Tenacious, intelligent, full of quality and affecting the game in the final third. Jamie Redknapp called him \"world class, perhaps the best of his type in world football.\"",
      "It's hard to argue.",
      "The £115m price tag had seemed to hang around his neck like a glittering weight in his early days at Chelsea but we're now seeing the player that bulldozed opposition players at Brighton.",
      "There's something N'Golo Kanté-esque about him, not just in engine or energy, but in humility. He doesn't crave the spotlight, he craves the ball. And when he gets it, the whole game dances to his tune. Xavi Simons looked almost frightened at times to dribble near the Chelsea enforcer such was the domination in the duels.",
      "He has that fear factor now. And that's one of the main reasons why he's the best in the world at what he does.Lewis Jones",
      "To beat Tottenham looks simple at the moment: defend set pieces properly and you're onto a winner. Chelsea, who before this game had conceded the most expected goals from set pieces this season, stood up and were counted against the Spurs set piece machine that had blown away Everton last weekend.",
      "Enzo Maresca's side didn't concede a single shot from set piece situations as Robert Sanchez commanded his area like he was the king of the skies. Yes, Spurs' delivery was unusually poor but the goalkeeper time-after-time took the pressure off his defenders by coming to catch and purposefully punch clear high balls.",
      "In a season where being able to defend your box under pressure from dead balls counts for a lot, Chelsea took a huge step in the right direction with this resolute defensive showing.Lewis Jones",
      "Jefferson Lerma had only made one Premier League start since the start of the season before the visit of Brentford to Selhurst Park - but he took his chance with both hands after Adam Wharton was ruled out through illness.",
      "The Colombian played a pivotal role in Crystal Palace's opener, latching onto a floated free-kick from Yeremy Pino and guiding a header into the path of Jean-Philippe Mateta, who did the rest. For their second, it was his long throw that Nathan Collins headed into the back of his own net.",
      "The nature of the second was ironic, given just how much of a threat the Bees have been from long throws this term. But Lerma was adept in that area before it was on trend.",
      "He won five of his seven duels on the day, too, and overall proved to Oliver Glasner that, while he is playing a bit-part role at the moment, he is ready and waiting to step up from the off whenever he's required.Dan Long",
      "Manchester United's winning run in the Premier League was brought to a halt at three at the City Ground as Nottingham Forest's quick start to the second half proved to be enough for the spoils to be shared. And in truth, Ruben Amorim's side only had themselves to blame.",
      "The Red Devils had gone into half-time with an albeit controversial lead, but were good value for their advantage. But what happened when the teams returned to the pitch was nothing short of a disaster.",
      "By minute 50, Morgan Gibbs-White and Nicolo Savona turned the game on its head. And the United players just didn't look like they were with it in the slightest.",
      "It forced them to be in a position they haven't been in over the course of the last three matches - chasing a goal. And more often than not, Amorim's men have struggled in this very circumstance as when teams set up against them in a low block, they just can't break them down.",
      "Thanks to Forest's set-piece woes and a wonderful strike from Amad Diallo, they took something back up north with them. But it could've been more if they hadn't stayed asleep at the start of the second 45.",
      "Post-match, Amorim bemoaned his team's lack of energy away from home, saying that they \"need to work on bringing the same away from home,\" as they do at Old Trafford. They may be showing signs of improvement, but this is one bad habit that they are clearly yet to shake.Callum Bishop",
      "Morgan Gibbs-White said he and his Nottingham Forest team-mates were frustrated not to take three points against Man Utd. It's been a long wait for a second Premier League win of the season, with their first coming way back on the opening weekend on August 17.",
      "They were good value for the win, too, looking comfortable until Amad Diallo's wonderstrike. Igor Jesus and Callum Hudson-Odoi went close to extending their advantage before that late equaliser and the Expected Goals data shows in their favour as well - 2 vs 1.15.",
      "But until Forest solve their set-piece problems, they are going to find winning matches hard. For all the controversy about the award of United's corner for Casemiro's opener, the defending from it was poor. Forest were static, the Brazilian given too much space to rise and head in.",
      "Amad's strike also came from a corner, when the ball was only half-cleared. That makes it 16 Premier League goals from set-piece situations conceded by Forest in 2025. That's the most of any other side in the competition.",
      "It's an obvious weakness. At least boss Sean Dyche can be encouraged that, if he solves that issue, he is developing promising signs elsewhere in Forest's play.Peter Smith",
      "Brighton's dominant win over Leeds saw them pick up their first clean sheet of the season - but Fabian Hurzeler's side provided a masterclass in defending from the front.",
      "The Seagulls' press was frenetic from the first whistle to the last, and didn't give the Leeds defence a moment of peace with the ball.",
      "The first shot on target for the visitors didn't come until the 85th minute - according to manager Fabian Hurzeler, that was just as much the result of the attack as the resolute defence.",
      "\"The clean sheet was well deserved. Everyone worked hard for it - not just the midfielders, but the defenders and the strikers.\"",
      "Consistency is the key from here on out for Hurzeler - but if the high press is this effective every week, the sky is the limit for his team.Noah Langford",
      "Leeds' struggles away from Elland Road continued with a limp performance on their way to a comprehensive defeat at Brighton, and this was perhaps the worst of the bunch.",
      "Their ineffective attack has been a key theme away from home this season - their only goals on the road came in their win against 20th placed Wolves.",
      "Leeds had only converted a staggering six per cent of their shots in October compared to 23 per cent for their opponents. November didn't start much better, as they only managed their first shot on target in the 85th minute against Brighton.",
      "Dominic Calvert-Lewin looked lost at sea once again at the head of the Leeds attack - his only half-decent chance came from a 25-yard effort that was always veering wide. Brendon Aaronson and Noah Okafor, his partners in attack, looked nowhere near as dangerous as they did against at home against West Ham.",
      "A ferocious West Yorkshire atmosphere has been able to spur Leeds to home victories this season - but a boost in attacking quality is needed if they want to pick up points on the road.Noah Langford",
      "Despite having just watched his win-less side lose 3-0 loss at Fulham to remain rooted to the foot of the Premier League, beleaguered Wolves boss Vitor Pereira was still in a defiant post-match mood down by the River Thames, insisting they were capable of avoiding relegation.",
      "The Portuguese pointed to last season, when he replaced Gary O'Neil at Molineux with Wolves having also not won any of their opening 10 league games of the campaign, as is the case this season, only for them to then embark on a six-match winning run that saw them finish in 16th.",
      "However, things feel different this time, not only because no team in Premier League history has ever stayed up with just two points from their opening 10 matches [Wolves had picked up three under O'Neil at the same stage last season], but also more pertinently because of the quality of the three promoted sides this campaign.",
      "Pereira said he has tried everything to get back to winnings ways - a new shape and different players at Craven Cottage - but admitted after what he called his side's worst display since he took over last December, he still \"does not have the answer.\"",

      "Hits and misses is a fun concept but Liverpool's win over Aston Villa highlighted the fine margins. Arne Slot's side ended their four-game winless streak as their pressing was rewarded for the opening goal, Villa making what Unai Emery called \"a huge mistake.\"",
      "The natural conclusion to draw was that Villa were foolish to attempt to pass out from the back, especially against a Liverpool side that have struggled against the long ball. But Villa came close to opening the scoring as a result of passing out from the back.",
      "Morgan Rogers struck the post with that chance, the move having been started by Emi Martinez in the Villa goal - the culprit for the error that led to Mohamed Salah's breakthrough strike. Matty Cash also struck the frame of the goal in the first half.",
      "\"The first 30 minutes we were fantastic continuing the way we did against Tottenham and Man City showing our capacity to dominate some times and create chances,\" explained Emery, adding: \"Of course, we need goals, but we hit two posts today.\"",
      "Slot acknowledged his team's fortune on the night. \"Maybe we were a bit more on the lucky side than we have been in the last few weeks. a mistake of their goalkeeper and a deflection led to two of our goals but these are the margins we are talking about.\"",
      "He added: \"In other games, we have created more in open play than we did today but football is about results not the chances you create from open play.\" Slot and Liverpool have found that out the hard way lately. This was Villa's turn to be on the receiving end.Adam Bate",

      "Amad Diallo produced a stunning volley to grab a point for Man Utd at Nottingham Forest as their winning run was halted by a rollercoaster 2-2 draw.",
      "With nine minutes to play and Forest looking comfortable, Amad cracked in a super left-foot strike when Nikola Milenkovic's header fell to him on the edge of the box. He then thought he'd hit a 94th-minute winner only to be denied by a goalline block by Murillo, capping a game packed with drama.",
      "United had led at half-time through a controversial Casemiro opener which sparked fury around the City Ground. The officials had awarded a corner when replays did not conclusively show all of the ball had crossed the line and the Brazilian subsequently headed in.",
      "\"It's not out,\" said former Premier League referee Mike Dean on Soccer Saturday. \"The ball is nowhere near out. It's just a guess by the referee.\"",
      "Forest had conceded from a corner which should have been given as a goal-kick at Bournemouth last weekend.",
      "Afterwards, Forest boss Sean Dyche called for a review of the rules, with VAR currently unable to intervene in those situations. \"We talk about the margins in football, we talk about VAR,\" he said. \"Why's it not brought in?",
      "\"Last week, really poor decision, cross goes in. This week, really poor decision, cross, goes in. Well get VAR on it then because it takes eight seconds to go 'it's in' or 'it's out'.\"",
      "Forest were fuelled by the injustice on Saturday, with Morgan Gibbs-White brilliantly heading in an equaliser three minutes into the second half before Nicolo Savona - who had been the player judged unable to keep the ball in for the controversial corner - pounced to prod in Forest's second.",
      "Nottingham Forest: Sels (6), Savona (7), Milenkovic (6), Murillo (8), Williams (7), Luiz (6), Anderson (8), Ndoye (6), Gibbs-White (8), Hudson-Odoi (7), Igor Jesus (6).\n\n\nSubs:  Yates (7), Awoniyi (6), Sangare (N/A)\n\n\nMan Utd: Lammens (7), Yoro (6), De Ligt (6), Shaw (7), Amad (8), Casemiro (7), Fernandes (7), Dalot (6), Mbeumo (7), Cunha (7), Sesko (6).\n\n\nSubs: Dorgu (6), Mazraoui (6)\n\n\nPlayer of the Match: Morgan Gibbs-White (Nottingham Forest)",
      "Bruno Fernandes drilled a low shot against an upright as United sought to swing the contest again but Forest weren't far off a third, with Igor Jesus heading wide from close range and Callum Hudson-Odoi blasting narrowly off target.",
      "Amad's firecracker left Forest ruing those misses and in the end they were indebted to Murillo's quick reactions.",
      "Nottingham Forest boss Sean Dyche:",
      "\"It's not conclusive. I've seen it back. Apparently today, the assistant referee can see 78 yards away. It's got to change. That's two in a week. Two decisions that are not right have gone against us in a week. Yes, of course, we then have to deal with the situation which we didn't do as well. But it is tough when there's a lot of noise about corners at this club and then they give corners that aren't corners.",
      "\"We had one last week, one this week. It's very tough on the team to take decisions like that. We talk about the margins in football, we talk about VAR, why it is not brought in? Last week, really poor decision, cross goes in. This week, really poor decision, cross, goes in. Well get VAR on it then because it takes eight seconds to go 'it's in' or 'it's out'.\"",

We managed to score again, we tried to win the game, we had a big opportunity in the end. We missed that little bit of luck. We need to work to bring the same away from home as we do in our stadium.",
      "\"We are getting better. Everyone can see. We are getting that feeling that if we can't win, at least we aren't going to lose. The way we press, the urgency with certain things, I think we did better last Sunday. We need to be like that in every game.\"",
      "On Amad's equaliser: \"It's something good for the fans. It was a really important goal for us. But I'm more focused on the 90 minutes. And what we did good. That's what I'll tell the players. Sometimes I forget that part and I judge the players when I see the games. But, we are doing things right. We are controlling the game. Of course we can do so much to grow. But there are a lot of things we are doing right.",

      "The Portuguese head coach has endured a difficult 12 months since arriving from Sporting, finishing 15th, losing in the Europa League final and winning only one of the first five games this season - which left him wondering if he would make it to a year in charge.",

      "\"It's hard to say. We need to think positively, but we also need to be prepared that football is [up and down]. And we are not that team that I can say to you, no, no, no.",
      "\"Now we can lose here or there, but we are going to maintain. I trust in my players more. I think they trust me more. That will come with wins. And you can sense that because everyone now is saying that, how connected they are and they believe in the manager.",
      "\"It's about winning games. It didn't change a lot because against Arsenal, I saw the same team, so I don't know.",
      "\"I think that we are in a better place, but it's also really good to be always with that feeling and prepare that something can change. If we have that feeling, we'll pay attention to the details and we'll maintain that course of our path.",

      "The former Everton boss did also go on to say Amorim should get time to continue his work at the club.",
      "On Thursday, Amorim said: \"First of all, maybe it is true that if we play in a 4-4-2 we won more games. But I always say that I have a way of playing that is going to take a while and then in the future it is going to be better.",

      "\"They are being a bit quicker to play forwards and longer, a bit tighter and getting back into their shape. That's management, that's coaching.",
      "\"That doesn't mean he's changed his whole philosophy, it just means he's adapting it to the challenge that's right in front of him. Fair play to him.\"",

      "Newcastle's £69m striker Nick Woltemade is contributing more than goals as Alexander Isak starts slowly at Liverpool; The Radar column also looks at the man-management techniques being used by Fabian Hurzeler on Charalampos Kostoulas and Brighton's other young players",
      "Sunday 2 November 2025 12:24, UK",
      "",
      "💪 Woltemade's strong start for Newcastle🔹 Kostoulas being challenged by Hurzeler🔍 A player to watch this weekend",
      "Nick Woltemade scored his third header of the season in Newcastle's Carabao Cup win over Spurs on Wednesday. The 6ft 6in striker is proving difficult to handle. And not just aerially.",
      "His tally of six goals in only 760 minutes includes two ingenious flicked finishes, one against Union Saint-Gilloise and an even better one against Brighton. There was a penalty lifted into the top corner against Nottingham Forest as if struck with a pitching wedge.",
      "It is a fitting level of variety for a player who is difficult to define. Woltemade has the physical profile to play the role of a targetman. His presence has allowed Newcastle to send more passes long in line with the Premier League's shift towards directness.",
      "He has scored headed goals against Wolves and Arsenal as well Spurs. Not many strikers can claim to have bested Gabriel Magalhaes this season but Woltemade towered over him when scoring Newcastle's opener against the Gunners in September.",
      "As is becoming increasingly clear to his new audience, though, he is also an excellent technician capable of a light touch as well as brute force. He is comfortable holding onto the ball in tight spaces. He drops deep and pulls wide to link the play. He can even dribble.",
      "His team-mates certainly value his all-round contribution. \"He is so big, it is a little bit easy for him to score goals with his head but he is a very good player,\" said Sandro Tonali after the Spurs game.",
      "\"He runs all 90 minutes every time. He plays with us, the midfielders and the defenders. He is the first defender and the first striker.\" Eddie Howe added that he \"set the tone\" for Newcastle's pressing.",
      "He is already loved by Newcastle supporters. His arrival, for £69m from Stuttgart in the summer, having previously been a target for Bayern Munich, has helped to ensure that, so far, at least, the departed Alexander Isak has not been missed.",
      "It has escaped nobody's attention that Woltemade has comprehensively outperformed his predecessor, who is yet to score in the Premier League for Liverpool, his only goal since his record £125m transfer coming in the Carabao Cup against Southampton.",
      "Yoane Wissa's injury absence has added to the pressure on Woltemade to perform and he continues to deliver. He has more Premier League goals, with four, than any of the 18 other strikers signed by Premier League clubs during a summer transfer window which featured unprecedented spending on forwards.",
      "It is all the more impressive given he has played fewer minutes than many of the other players in the list, including all of Chelsea's Joao Pedro, Arsenal's Viktor Gyokeres, Liverpool's Hugo Ekitike and Manchester United's Benjamin Sesko.",
      "He is of course a different type of player to the man he has replaced. He is not generating as many shots or creating as many chances as Isak last term but he offers an aerial outlet, wins more duels, makes more pressures and regains possession more frequently.",
      "His heat map hints at a broader remit.",
      "While Isak was focused on stretching opposition defences with runs in behind, Woltemade is more likely to be seen further away from goal, helping to construct attacks as well as finish them.",
      "Woltemade is still acclimatising to certain aspects of the Premier League. Issa Diop and Calvin Bassey subjected him to rough treatment which often went unpunished against Fulham last weekend, much to the striker's frustration.",
      "But overall the speed of his adaptation has been hugely impressive. His challenge now is just to continue in the same vein.",
      "So, is his current scoring rate sustainable? Woltemade has scored four goals from four shots on target in the Premier League. Factor in his goals in the Champions League and Carabao Cup and, amazingly, it is six from six shots on target overall.",
      "He has reached that tally from chances worth only 3.46 expected goals, an overperformance which suggests a reversion to the mean may lie ahead. And yet, his actual goal total could easily be higher.",
      "Woltemade hit the post from close range in last weekend's 2-1 win over Fulham and struck the underside of the crossbar in the game against Nottingham Forest, during which he also had a goalbound effort blocked by defender Morato inside the six-yard box.",
      "Newcastle may ultimately need to service him with more scoring opportunities. They will need their wingers to contribute more goals too, with Jacob Murphy, Harvey Barnes, Anthony Gordon and Anthony Elanga having only found the net once in the Premier League between them so far this season.",
      "But in Woltemade right now, they have a player giving them exactly what they need, filling an Isak-shaped void, contributing a lot more than just goals, and, two months into the season, winning the battle of the Premier League's new No 9s.",
      "From Newcastle to Brighton, where it has been a slower start for Charalampos Kostoulas, another of the Premier League's newly-signed strikers having joined from Olympiakos for £31.4m in June.",
      "The 18-year-old came with a reputation as one of Europe's most exciting young frontmen and finally earned a first start in Brighton's Carabao Cup tie against Arsenal on Wednesday having scored his first goal from the bench against Manchester United.",
      "Unfortunately for him, it did not last long.",
      "Kostoulas looked menacing from the left flank in the first half at the Emirates Stadium but he was withdrawn at the interval with Fabian Hurzeler citing \"physical reasons\" afterwards.",
      "\"He needs to adapt to the intensity of the Premier League, he needs to adapt to the demands,\" said the Brighton boss.",
      "The 32-year-old talked up the importance of \"honest feedback\" having been firm with Baleba over his performances following a summer of transfer speculation. Hurzeler has taken him off at half-time on three separate occasions this season. \"Carlos won't get better if he only gets compliments and claps from outside,\" he said.",
      "Clearly, Hurzeler is pushing Kostoulas in the same way. And even if it feels uncomfortable, the striker should keep in mind that his team-mate appears to have benefitted. Baleba was Brighton's best performer against Arsenal, dominating the midfield in the first half and demonstrating the potential Hurzeler is trying to extract.",
      "No Dean Huijsen, no problem for Bournemouth. They have another young gem at centre-back in Veljko Milosavljevic.",
      "The 18-year-old Serb is pushing to face Erling Haaland and Manchester City on Super Sunday having helped Bournemouth keep a clean sheet against Nottingham Forest last time out.",
      "Sunderland host Everton on Monday Night Football. Tune in from 6.30pm ahead of the 8pm kick-off.",
      "Joao Palhinha, Rodrigo Bentancur and Tottenham's issues playing through midfield featured in last week's column. There was also a look at Bruno Fernandes' stunning record for Man Utd ahead of his 300th appearance."

      "Manchester United director of football Jason Wilcox has promised investment in the \"right\" signings in order to realise the club's long-term vision.",
      "United have hit a groove of positivity, having won three league games on the bounce for the first time since boss Ruben Amorim's appointment last November.",
      "Summer signings Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Senne Lammens have played their role in United's upturn in form, with fans impressed with not only their performances but their evident attitude.",
      "United's recent transfer success is a trend that Wilcox suggests will continue at Old Trafford as the club aim to re-establish themselves at the top of the Premier League, as well as being capable of competing in Europe.",
      "\"We have got a clear plan,\" Wilcox told the Man Utd website.",
      "\"We know what we have got to do, we know the areas of the team that we have got to improve.",
      "\"For us to get in the top four and consistently challenge for Champions League places, win Champions League, win Premier League, we have got to invest in the squad.",
      "\"We have got to buy the right players. The right players who are talented but also who can deal with the pressure, who can take the squad forward. It is not always about just signing elite talent, they have got to have the right character and be somebody who can bring something different to the team.\"",
      "United's summer transfer window is likely to be an important one given the fact that some members of the squad are approaching the final six months of their current deals, such as Casemiro and Harry Maguire. United had looked at possible options in the middle last summer but had prioritised other positions, especially up front. However, potential outgoings present an opportunity to strengthen in the middle of the park.",
      "The Old Trafford club have long been admirers of Brighton's Carlos Baleba - but he is just one of a number of midfielders they continue to monitor.",
      "Nottingham Forest's Elliot Anderson is another on the radar Old Trafford, given his impressive performances have continued into this campaign.",
      "While transfer business is not on the immediate agenda, Wilcox heaped praise on United's summer acquisitions, who he says are guiding the club in the right direction on the pitch.",
      "\"They are all good guys,\" Wilcox said.",
      "\"Even from last summer's window, they are top professionals, top players and we are really optimistic we are going in the right direction.",
      "\"I am sure there are going to be bumps in the road but we have just got to make sure we stay calm irrespective of the noise outside.",
      "\"I see the intensity, I am at training every day, I see the way that they train, the way they apply themselves, the way they communicate and get on with each other.",
      "\"Like I say, when you lose football matches you are always going to be a little bit disappointed and especially at this club.\"",
      "Super 6 are starting the season by guaranteeing a £1,000,000 winner! Play for free."
