      "Ruben Amorim has admitted that wantaway stars Kobbie Mainoo and Joshua Zirkzee could depart in January, but not at the expense of Manchester United. The Red Devils boss is adamant the club can not lose out simply to satisfy players.",
      "Neither Mainoo or Zirkzee have started a Premier League match this season. The latter has racked up just 82 minutes in the division, while academy product Mainoo has recorded 93 minutes since coming on against Burnley in August.",
      "Both will be keen to have more playing time to stand a chance of representing their nations in the World Cup next summer. They will need more time on the pitch to earn a call-up for the Netherlands and England for the tournament in the United States, Canada and Mexico.",
      "United are set to lose Bryan Mbeumo, Amad and Noussair Mazraoui during the Africa Cup of Nations. With injuries to forwards Benjamin Sesko and Matheus Cunha, Amorim does not want to be caught short.",
      "The Portuguese coach could take United into fourth place with a big enough win over Everton on Monday. A dramatic improvement upon the club's 15th-place finish last term.",
      "Amorim understands why his players may be discontent, but is unwilling to sacrifice United's progress.",
      "\"I was a football player,\" he said. \"I understand everything, and I want to help my players in every situation. I understand the frustration of some players, seeing the World Cup is there. I know what it means.",
      "\"But the first thing is that the club comes first. If I can help the club and the players, I will be happy. If not I have to think about the team.\"",
      "Despite being on a five-game unbeaten run, Amorim is wary that his side's progress is in a precarious position. United squandered leads against Nottingham Forest and Tottenham before the international break.",
      "The 40-year-old wants all of his tools at his disposal to avoid moving off track. \"I don't like to say the storm is over,\" he said.",
      "\"It's my job, especially in our club, to always have that feeling [that a storm is coming]. It gives me the sense of urgency in every training [session] and, in the Premier League, everything can change so fast because all the teams can win any game.\"",

      "Manchester United could be missing five key players for their clash with Everton. David Moyes is set to return to his old stomping ground as the aim to put a dent in United's recent resurgence on Monday evening.",
      "However, Ruben Amorim's side will have to face the challenge without some crucial squad members as injury woes start to plague the Theatre of Dreams. The Red Devils are currently on a five-match unbeaten run, with three victories and two consecutive draws, the latter two games showcasing dramatic performances that secured them a point each.",
      "A victory at Old Trafford by three or more goals could catapult United into the top four, but even a simple win would suffice to keep the heat on those occupying the Champions League spots. Summer recruit Matheus Cunha has become an injury concern for United after he was absent from a Christmas lights switch-on event at the weekend.",
      "\"Unfortunately, Matheus Cunha has had an accident in training today and will not be able to attend tonight's Christmas Lights Switch on in Altrincham due to medical reasons,\" VisitAltrincham announced in a statement.",
      "Whether he'll make an appearance against Everton is still up in the air, though ESPN has reported that Cunha's 'minor knock' could still see him fit enough to play.",
      "Meanwhile, Benjamin Sesko is set to continue his spell on the side-lines due to injury. The Slovenian was forced off during the 2-2 draw with Tottenham Hotspur due to a knee injury.",
      "Rumours have surfaced suggesting that Sesko could be out of action for up to a month due to the injury.",
      "Speaking about Sesko's situation, Amorim said: \"He is going to stay a few weeks out. I don't know how long but it is not that serious. We have to be careful with him. He is going to recover.",
      "\"He is doing the recovery and he is feeling better so we expect in a few weeks to have him back. I think it is going to be more or less he will be back at the same time as Amad and Mbeumo leave for AFCON. I don't want to say for sure but when they are going to the camp I expect to have Ben back.\"",
      "Defender Harry Maguire will also be absent for the Toffees' trip to Old Trafford. The England defender sustained a muscle injury during United's draw with Tottenham before the international break.",
      "Amorim confirmed that Maguire is \"not ready\" to feature against Everton on Monday night, and it remains to be seen when the England international will make his return to the squad. Kobbie Mainoo is in a race against the clock to be fit for the Everton clash.",
      "The midfielder missed the draw with Tottenham before the international break after picking up a knock. The 20-year-old will need to demonstrate his fitness if he is to feature in the squad.",
      "Amorim also confirmed that Mainoo had not yet returned to training as of Friday, though he remained hopeful the midfielder would be back involved ahead of the Everton fixture. He said: \"Kobbie didn't train today but I think tomorrow we could see Kobbie so we will see.\"",
      "Lisandro Martinez remains on the road to recovery as he continues his rehabilitation from the knee injury he sustained in February. The problem was serious enough to require surgery for the Argentine, who has since been gradually building up his fitness levels ahead of his return to the starting XI.",
      "Amorim indicated recently that he expects to have the Argentina international back in action in the coming weeks. He said: \"He needs more time to work there, and he is not working there, but in an emergency, he can play, but I am not thinking about that.",
      "\"I feel Licha is becoming close to being able to play. We need to be careful, he is going to struggle in the first minutes but he is clearly in a better position than he was two weeks ago.\"",
      "As for Everton, former United transfer target Jarrad Branthwaite is unavailable, as is fellow defender Nathan Patterson. Merlin Rohl is also expected to be absent after undergoing surgery during the international break.",

      "After months of progress at Barcelona, Marcus Rashford was dealt a rough hand this week. That's after the Manchester United loanee was forced to watch from the sidelines as the rest of his team-mates in Catalonia made history.",
      "Back at Old Trafford, Ruben Amorim is hard at work preparing for a January transfer window that could be transformative for the club. The Red Devils are finally on the rise this season, and much of that has been down to the squad improvements made in the summer.",
      "Saturday marked a special day in Barcelona's calendar after the club finally made its return to the renovated Camp Nou after two years away. The Blaugrana battered Athletic Club 4-0 in the first fixture to be played at the remodelled stadium, but Rashford was nowhere to be seen.",
      "\"Marcus Rashford will miss today's match against Athletic Club due to flu,\" read an official club statement. And the news excluded Rashford from being part of the historic unveiling of Barca's new-and-improved venue.",
      "Rashford had previously communicated his ambitions to play in the upgraded Camp Nou once it was open for business. Speaking at an open training session earlier in November, he said: \"It's a very nice feeling. It's a beautiful stadium and when it is full it's going to be unbelievable.",
      "\"Camp Nou was always one of my favourite stadiums and one I wanted to play in. But to play on it for Barcelona is going to be a different feeling. I can't wait to be on the pitch. I will enjoy it.\"",
      "The silver lining is Rashford will still get his chance to be a part of Barca's line-up when they welcome their first capacity crowd at the Camp Nou. Saturday's game was played in front of a crowd of only around 45,000, with some renovation work still ongoing.",
      "When the work is complete and the stadium is fully up and running, it's expected to house up to around 105,000 fans. And given Rashford's impact under Hansi Flick so far this season, one would imagine he'll be one of the first names on the team sheet provided he's fit when that occasion comes around.",
      "One target being touted for a move to Old Trafford of late is Borussia Dortmund forward Karim Adeyemi. However, United's chances of landing the German have taken a knock after it was reported he'd prefer to join Arsenal instead.",
      "Despite a complete overhaul of their attacking line-up in the summer, the Red Devils are being linked with more forward reinforcements in 2026. And Adeyemi looks like a realistic target after it emerged talks over a new Dortmund deal are understood to have stalled.",
      "The 23-year-old winger's current contract runs until the summer of 2027, meaning Dortmund will be expected to accept a lower fee for his services. However, that hasn't prevented reports suggesting the Black and Yellows want £75million for their man, which is believed to be more than United are willing to pay.",
      "That could give Arsenal the opening they need to swoop in should they decide they see more value in his signature. On the plus side, United share a largely positive relationship with Adeyemi's agent, Jorge Mendes, who has helped execute the signings of clients like Leny Yoro and Manuel Ugarte in recent years.",
      "The supposed £75m price-tag becomes that much more difficult to justify considering Adeyemi has fallen somewhat out of favour under Niko Kovac. The attacker was an automatic starter for much of the first half of this season but has been benched for their last three Bundesliga games, scoring just four times in 15 games across all competitions this term.",

      "As the dust settles on Sunday afternoon’s north London derby against Tottenham, Arsenal turn their focus towards a busy week. There will be no respite for Mikel Arteta or his players as the Premier League leaders take on Bayern Munich next in Wednesday’s Champions League fixture.",
      "That will be followed by a crucial league visit to Stamford Bridge on Sunday. Meanwhile, the Gunners manager and sporting director Andrea Berta will have one eye on the transfer market, with just over a month left until the January window opens.",
      "We now take a look at two news stories that have emerged in the past few days which might determine how the north Londoners act in the coming transfer windows.",
      "Arsenal’s desire to upgrade in the left wing position in the summer was no secret. Antoine Semenyo’s incredible form over the past two seasons, along with his openness about being an Arsenal fan, has seen the Gunners linked with the Bournemouth sensation in recent months.",
      "But it is highly unlikely that Arsenal will pull off a transfer for the Ghanaian, who is said to have a £65million release clause in his contract. Although the Gunners remain compliant with PSR rules, they are believed to be sailing close to the wind where UEFA Squad Cost rules are concerned after their record-breaking summer spending spree.",
      "It is therefore understood that, barring any major sale on their part, January is set to be a quiet month in terms of transfer business in N5. That’s especially the case given that Arteta’s side have made a strong start to the season, with an abundance of depth at the Spaniard’s disposal.",
      "Should Semenyo stay at the Vitality Stadium until the end of the campaign, when his release clause will decrease, Arsenal could change their position, particularly if Gabriel Martinelli is offloaded. But the 25-year-old Bournemouth star is already being linked with several rivals, including Liverpool and Tottenham, which means bringing him to the Emirates Stadium could be a huge challenge.",
      "Another player Arteta is known to be a big fan of is Juventus’ Kenan Yildiz. Berta has been keeping track of the Turkey international’s situation in Turin, although that is standard practice rather than a major development.",
      "Yildiz, capable of playing as a left winger or as a central attacking midfielder, is still in contract talks with Juventus over a potential pay-rise, with the Serie A giants believing the 20-year-old deserves a more lucrative pay package.",
      "Yet, their negotiations are still ongoing after several months, with a positive outcome yet to be reached. Juve’s sporting director Giorgio Chiellini has maintained that the club are relaxed about the situation, with Yildiz being under contract until June 2029.",
      "Sources close to Yildiz have confirmed there has been informal contact from a number of Premier League clubs in the past six months to gain an understanding of the Turk's situation. But, even if Juventus are unable to agree a new deal with the player, the ex-Bayern Munich youth sensation is expected to command a premium fee.",
      "Manchester United were among the clubs considering a move for Yildiz earlier this year, before eventually signing Matheus Cunha in the summer. Chelsea and Real Madrid could also compete with Arsenal for his signature given their interest in the player.",

      "Manchester United have NOT made an approach for Joao Gomes, according to Wolves boss Rob Edwards. The Brazilian features on the Red Devils’ shortlist as they target an overhaul of their midfield under Ruben Amorim.",
      "He features alongside Nottingham Forest star Elliot Anderson, Brighton’s Carlos Baleba and Conor Gallagher of Atletico Madrid. With the transfer window just over a month away, United are expected to ramp up their efforts of signing a new midfielder soon.",
      "But as it stands, the Red Devils are yet to make an official approach to Wolves over Gomes. Speaking ahead of his side’s 2-0 defeat to Crystal Palace, boss Edwards said: \"We've spoken about stuff but my focus has been on getting the team organised.",
      "“We have got some good players and there will always be interest, but I'm not aware of anything. Joao has been excellent this week.\"",
      "One man who would be a big fan of Gomes moving to Old Trafford is his former Wolves teammate Matheus Cunha. The forward has compared Gomes to current Red Devils star Casemiro amid glowing praise.",
      "He said: \"He is a bit older now but I put Casemiro's name there only to show where Joao Gomes could arrive. I think Joao has the possibility to arrive. He is very humble, and he works a lot. The good teams come like a gift when you do that.",
      "\"He is unbelievable on the pitch. I feel very secure. I feel like I can lose the ball when I have my midfielders behind me. He played very well for the national team, too.\"",
      "Gomes, 24, joined Wolves from Brazilian side Flamengo in 2023 and he has gone on to make 104 appearances for the side since then, scoring seven goals. He only signed a new deal with Wolves earlier this year, that contract set to run until 2030, but it is thought that an offer in the region of around £44m might be enough to facilitate an exit.",
      "Gomes remains far from the only option for United in their task to sign a new midfielder. Nottingham Forest’s Anderson is a priority target - albeit his £100m price tag could present the Red Devils with a significant issue.",
      "Speaking about potential interest in his star midfielder, Forest boss Dyche said: “It is nothing to do with me, it is the powers that be. They run the club and the financial side. I’m sure they will ask my opinion about the situation, if it is needed - not just about him but about all the players here.”",

      "Manchester United are sweating on the fitness of Matheus Cunha after the forward picked up an injury in training on Saturday. United face Everton on Monday in the Premier League and are already a forward down, with Benjamin Sesko on the sidelines - and now Cunha is a doubt.",
      "The Brazilian forward had been set for a key role in the match at Old Trafford, with Ruben Amorim likely to field him as a false No.9 in the absence of Sesko. But news of a possible injury blow arrived via an unusual source on Saturday.",
      "Cunha had been due to switch on the Christmas lights in Altrincham on Saturday evening. But the 26-year-old ending up pulling out of the ceremonial role in the town, prompting a statement.",
      "VisitAltrincham wrote on social media: \"Unfortunately, Matheus Cunha has had an accident in training today and will not be able to attend tonight's Christmas Lights Switch on in Altrincham due to medical reasons.\"",
      "That news worried United fans, who already knew their side had been without Sesko, Harry Maguire and Kobbie Mainoo in Friday's training session. But ESPN reports that Cunha has only picked up a 'minor knock', which sounds a lot less worrying than 'accident'.",
      "Nevertheless, Cunha remains a doubt for the Everton match and will be assessed in the run-up to the 8pm kick-off on Monday. He has managed just one goal in 11 appearances for United so far this season following his £62.5million transfer from Wolves in the summer.",
      "Despite his lack of goals, the Brazil international has been a key player for Amorim in attack, blending well with fellow new arrival Bryan Mbeumo. His importance for Monday's game was increased by the news that Sesko had not shaken off the injury he picked up in the 2-2 draw against Tottenham before the international break.",
      "\"He is going to be a few weeks out,\" Amorim said in his pre-match press conference on Friday. \"Not that serious, we have to be careful. He is feeling better.\"",
      "Amorim said Mainoo would be assessed in Saturday's training session, but Maguire was ruled out of Monday's game. \"Maguire is not ready,\" Amorim said. \"Kobbie didn’t train today but I think we could see Kobbie tomorrow so we’ll see.”",

      "Manchester United could offer Antoine Semenyo his preferred No. 24 shirt in a bid to lure the Bournemouth forward to Old Trafford in January. The Red Devils are reportedly looking to sign the Ghana international from the south coast this winter and hold a potential edge over other suitors being touted.",
      "Semenyo, 25, has netted six goals and provided three assists in just 11 Premier League matches this season. He is increasingly linked with a mid-season move to the Red Devils as a result and knowing his usual jersey is on offer could play a role in negotiations.",
      "The No. 24 shirt is currently occupied by goalkeeper Andre Onana, who is on loan at Trabzonspor until the end of the season. But United may not have any qualms about making it available for Semenyo.",
      "This subtle gesture could prove crucial in their pursuit of one of the most sought-after players in the Premier League right now. Onana's future at United looks bleak after a series of blunders tarnished his reputation and the success of Senne Lammens has only made his position more precarious.",
      "The summer recruit from Royal Antwerp has proved to be a steal in United colours thus far. So much so that Onana, who cost £43.4million when he reunited with former Ajax chief Erik ten Hag in 2023, already seems redundant.",
      "Semenyo's availability in January has sparked a lot of chatter after it was revealed the player has a £65m release clause in his Bournemouth contract. The winger signed fresh terms on the south coast over the summer but it's understood he only penned the new contract with the understanding the Cherries would include a release clause.",
      "That's enough to suggest Semenyo, who has previously hinted his preference would be to join Arsenal, would be willing to move if the right opportunity presents itself. And the £65m figure presents a fairly realistic price for the biggest spenders in England's top flight.",
      "Nonetheless, there are perhaps still concerns as to whether United could afford such a splurge midway through the campaign. Ruben Amorim's side recruited Bryan Mbeumo, Matheus Cunha and Benjamin Sesko for a combined fee of around £200m, leaving some question as to where Semenyo would even fit into the XI without dropping one of those players.",
      "That being said, Semenyo has showcased his versatility in just about any attacking role, including the No. 10 position. One solution could see him take that slot off Bruno Fernandes' hands and drop the Portugal talisman into a deeper midfield role.",
      "However, United fans might be disheartened to discover they aren't as highly regarded in the race for Semenyo's signature as others. The Athletic has reported Liverpool and Manchester City are leading the chase for his signature, with both teams likely more enticing to most players at present.",
      "United could also offer Semenyo the No. 9 jersey should they desire. The number has been left vacant after Rasmus Hojlund left to join Napoli on loan over the summer.",
      "While it may seem fairly minimal in the grand scheme of things, having the right shirt number is of major importance to certain star talents. It just so happens Liverpool would also be able to offer the No. 24, though Josko Gvardiol currently wears that jersey for City.",

The rivalry between Keane and Haaland started when the ex-Manchester United star ruptured his anterior cruciate ligament during a match against Leeds United in 1997.",
      "Haaland controversially stood over the Irishman and claimed the midfielder was feigning injury. Reflecting on the incident, the former striker said: \"He tried to tackle me and I got the free kick.",

      "He was dismissed for stamping on his knee with considerable force, something he acknowledged wasn't accidental in his 2002 autobiography. He said: \"I'd waited long enough. I f****** hit him hard. The ball was there (I think). Take that, you c***. And don't ever stand over me sneering about fake injuries.\"",
      "Keane was handed a three-match ban and a £5,000 fine initially, but this was extended once he confessed to deliberate intent in his book. An additional £150,000 fine and a five-match suspension were imposed.",
      "The 54-year-old remains unapologetic about his infamous tackle on Haaland, insisting he never intended to cause serious harm. Speaking on the Stick to Football podcast, he said: \"This is my last time talking about this tackle, the Haaland one.",
      "\"I still don't think it was a bad tackle, I really don't. I don't care what anyone says. It's not as bad as everyone thinks it is. When you play sport at that speed we played at, there's a difference between hurting somebody and injuring somebody - big difference. That's my argument. I was trying to hurt him, not injure somebody.\"",
      "Haaland, who retired in 2003 due to an injury on the leg opposite to the one Keane targeted, has a different perspective. In 2024, he said: \"Is that a coincidence, or isn't it? If you're in the ground and someone hits you in the right leg, you can still twist your other leg. It can get injured and that's probably what happened.",
      "\"I haven't played a full 90 minutes after that incident, that's the hard fact. And people can judge whatever they want. Obviously, I found out afterwards that it was with intent and he was seeking revenge and all these things. I think that's a bit sad. Sad for football and it was not good for me either at the time.\"",
      "Keane maintains that Haaland turned out for his country just four days following the clash and subsequently featured for City. He said: \"Haaland finished the game and played four days later, for Norway.",
      "\"A couple of years later, he tried to claim that he'd had to retire because of the tackle. He was going to sue me. It was a bad tackle but he was still able to play four days later.\"",

      "Manchester United are getting ready to return to action following the final international break of 2025. The Red Devils host Everton on Monday night, aiming to build on the mini-revival that has eased the pressure on head coach Ruben Amorim.",
      "Following back-to-back wins over Liverpool and Brighton, United were slightly frustrated with draws away to Nottingham Forest and Tottenham. However, following such a troubled start to the season, there are signs that Amorim’s expensive squad is beginning to gel.",
      "Amorim has been left pleasantly surprised by one of his summer signings. The goalkeeper position has been a problem area for United since the departure of David de Gea, with his replacement, Andre Onana, making a string of costly blunders.",
      "Altay Bayındır was given a chance at the start of the season but failed to impress, while Onana was shipped off to Trabzonspor on loan and looks unlikely to play for the club again.",
      "As a result, United brought in Senne Lammens from Royal Antwerp. While it is still early days, the 23-year-old has impressed with some assured performances. Amorim has been delighted to see Lammens look so confident so early in his United career.",
      "He told Stadium Astro: “Of course, we do our diligence when we are going to buy players.",
      "“It was a surprise. All the pressure that we suffer with the goalkeeper position, to arrive here and to show that confidence. To transmit that confidence to the team, I think, was a little bit of a surprise for me.",
      "“I’m not going to say everyone, but I’m talking as a manager. I have no problem to say that was a surprise for me.”",
      "Club legend Bryan Robson wants to see United strengthen their midfield with another player like Casemiro. Having mainly signed attack players in the summer, the middle of the pitch will be an area of focus for Amorim ahead of the January window.",
      "Former Real Madrid star Casemiro, 33, has come in for criticism in recent seasons amid claims that the Brazilian is past his best. But Robson says he doesn’t get the credit he deserves and would like to see another player of his ilk arrive this winter.",
      "Robson told Sportsboom: “People say he’s not this or he’s not that, his legs have gone. Not for me, Casemiro is still a fantastic player, and he would be on my team sheet every time. I think we’d benefit from another Casemiro-like midfielder, that would definitely help us.”",
      "Robson also believes Kobbie Mainoo could still have a future at the club, despite his lack of game time under Amorim. The former Middlesbrough boss added: “I think the future is bright, the club has some great young players.",
      "“I still think there’s a lot more to come from some of these young players, just look at Kobbie Mainoo.",
      "“He had so many injuries last year, it really was a stop-start season for him, but you look at the year before and he was outstanding for the last six months of the season. There’s a lot more to come from Mainoo and the other young lads.”",

      "Former Manchester United midfielder Paul Pogba has finally made his eagerly-anticipated debut for Monaco, though he was thrust into a nightmare situation with his team trailing 4-0. Pogba hadn't featured in competitive action for two years following a four-year doping suspension that was subsequently cut to 18 months on appeal.",
      "Following 811 days on the sidelines, Pogba can once again consider himself an active player after a brief yet undoubtedly fulfilling 10-minute appearance on Saturday night. Sadly, Monaco were being demolished 4-0 by Rennes when Pogba entered the fray.",
      "Former Arsenal forward Mika Biereth pulled one back deep into stoppage time but strikes from Abdelhamid Ait Boudlal, Mahdi Camara, Breel Embolo and Ludovic Bias had placed Rennes firmly in the driving seat.",
      "Regarding Pogba's performance, he registered 17 touches and completed 14 passes from 15 attempts. In defensive terms, he recorded two ball recoveries and one interception.",
      "The world champion has now revealed his emotions on playing again after being absent for more than two years due to his suspension and subsequent fitness issues.",
      "Speaking in the mixed zone, as reported by RMC Sport, Pogba said: \"I was disappointed to lose this match. It's Paul Pogba's return, but I play for Monaco, and I don't like losing. I was really happy on one hand, but on the other, I was disappointed with the result and what we did on the pitch.",
      "\"It touched me, the reception. Seeing the crowd stand up and applaud, I wasn't expecting that. A big thank you to the fans who personally supported me.",
      "\"The feeling was good, I wanted to bring good energy, not concede a goal, enjoy myself, it's been a long time. I'm relieved to be back playing football, what I love most in the world. There's still work to do to get back to full fitness.\"",
      "Monaco boss Sebastien Pocognoli had teased a potential comeback for Pogba during his pre-match press conference.",
      "He said: \"We have a session today [Friday] so we'll see. If it goes well, he can be there. He has had a run of sessions, and the feedback is positive. He has been able to test himself in match conditions. There are good signs.\"",
      "It wouldn't have been the comeback to football Pogba would have probably been envisioning, but simply being back playing the game he adores will have almost certainly felt like a monumentally important milestone.",
      "Pogba will now be hoping to step up his involvement over the forthcoming weeks and also feature in the Champions League for the first time in more than three-and-a-half years.",
      "Monaco face Cypriot outfit Pafos next Tuesday as they aim to build upon the five points already secured from four fixtures. Pogba's team then take on defending Ligue 1 champions Paris Saint-Germain that weekend.",
      "After signing for the French side as a free agent in June 2025, Pogba was given a tailored training plan to get him match fit. His return was expected against Paris FC earlier this month, but a minor injury put his comeback on hold.",

      "Scott Minto believes that Liverpool should avoid signing Antoine Semenyo in the January transfer window and go all-in for Marc Guehi. Arne Slot has struggled to find his stride in the Premier League this season, with the heart of Liverpool's defence proving particularly problematic.",
      "The side have shipped 20 goals thus far, with their previously impenetrable defence of Virgil van Dijk and Ibrahima Konate looking far weaker in 2025/26 for one reason or another. Elsewhere, summer signing Milos Kerkez has suffered teething problems since his £40million switch from Bournemouth this summer, while Jeremie Frimpong has been plagued by hamstring injury.",
      "As a result of the latter's issues, the Reds have been forced to utilise the likes of Dominik Szoboszlai as a makeshift right-back to compensate. The club have also been hampered by an inability to create and put away chances this term, despite major acquisitions in the form of Florian Wirtz, Hugo Ekitike and Alexander Isak.",
      "And while some may be quick to point the finger of blame at Slot's strike force as the catalyst of their qualms this term, others have highlighted how the back line may need further investment when the transfer window re-opens. Speaking on talkSPORT this week, Sam Matterface asked Minto and Alex Crook why they would be tempted to splurge on Crystal Palace skipper Guehi in January, given he will be available as a free agent in the summer.",
      "To which, Minto replied: \"Because questions are being asked now. Are they even going to finish in the top four? But lets see, he’s not just a short-term fix, he’s an £80million footballer.",
      "\"He's an £80million pound footballer that they could have got for £35million but for things going on elsewhere, and if they had put down £40m, £45m they probably would have got him straight away. And yet what do we think the problems are with Liverpool right now?\"",
      "Crook then added: \"I don't think Liverpool are in any kind of financial situation because they went for a couple of transfer windows didn't they? Didn't spend anything, and actually you look at their net spend which is what I was talking about…Their net spend in this summer transfer window was £218million pound less than Arsenal so I think they have got the funds.\"",
      "To which, Minto explained: \"So I would I would bring in Marc Guehi rather than Antoine Semenyo,\" before Crook asked: \"Because Van Dijk and Konate have been vulnerable?” The former Chelsea and West Ham star then replied: \"Absolutely.\"",
      "Liverpool chased Guehi's signature this summer in a deal which very nearly looked like going through until the eleventh hour. While Liverpool looked to have snagged a deadline day transfer for the England international to the tune of £35m, Palace eventually blocked the move as a result of struggling to find a replacement in time.",
      "Should Liverpool ditch their endeavours of signing Semenyo in favour of trying to strike a deal for Guehi, it would be fantastic news for Manchester United fans. The Red Devils were also linked with the Ghanaian over the course of the summer, before he ultimately committed his future to the Cherries in a new deal which should keep him at the Vitality Stadium until 2030.",
      "However, it was recently reported that Bournemouth may be powerless in fending off interest from potential suitors in January, given Semenyo's contract is said to hold a £65m release clause which can be activated by any club. While United bolstered their attacking line with the likes of Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko this summer, they could still seek further firepower as they look to qualify for European football for 2026/27.",
      "And given Semenyo's impressive haul of six goals from 11 games this season, they may opt to pick up where they left off in tailing the 25-year-old this summer when the January transfer window blows open.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Jadon Sancho has been told to halve his £300,000-a-week wages if he wants to return to Borussia Dortmund. The German outfit are keen on re-signing Sancho for a third time next summer.",
      "Sancho is desperate to find a club which can help him revive his career, and knows his best spells have been at Dortmund. But Dortmund bosses have made it clear his current contract is not affordable to them.",
      "Gregor Kobel is currently Dortmund's highest paid star, on £150,000-a-week. And Sancho would have to fall into line with the club's wage structure, in order to seal a move back to the Bundesliga outfit.",
      "Sancho has seen his career turn into a nightmare since joining Manchester United from Dortmund in 2021. The winger failed to make an impact and ended up returning to Dortmund on-loan in 2024, following a public bust up with then United boss Erik ten Hag.",
      "While back at Dortmund, he helped them reach the Champions League final. Sancho spent last season on-loan at Chelsea, who refused the option of making the move permanent last summer.",
      "Sancho is currently on loan at Aston Villa, but has struggled for game time and made just four league appearances. He knows he needs to leave English football behind once again next summer, but it remains to be seen if he is willing to reduce his wage demands.",
      "Sancho can leave United on a free transfer in June when his contract expires, and will be able to negotiate signing on fee with a new club. He can start talking to interested clubs in January.",
      "The winger had a successful four-year stint with Dortmund between 2017 and 2021, netting 50 goals and providing 64 assists in 137 games. It was by far the best period of his career, which was derailed by his £73million transfer to United in the summer of 2021.",
      "He has managed just 12 goals and six assists in 83 games for United, where he fell out with Erik ten Hag and was exiled by Ruben Amorim. Things haven't started well for him at Villa, either, with minutes hard to come by under Unai Emery.",
      "The Villa boss even embarrassed him by substituted Sancho on and off against Manchester City in the Premier League last month. The winger faced the ignominy of entering the field in the 29th minute and being replaced by Evann Guessand after 74 minutes against Pep Guardiola's men.",
      "“I am so happy because his impact was good, his electricity, his skill, but then to play more than now, he’s not ready to play 90 minutes,\" said Emery. \"45 minutes is not easy enough for him, and I am happy and, of course, progressively, he’s getting better and better.”",

      "He said: \"It is a circumstance that we already knew, but it is an opportunity for other players. We also have the Under-21s and we need to also send a message in that time, so we will see. But of course, it is not ideal because they [Amad, Mazraoui and Mbeumo] are so important in our team and we don't have a long squad. But our Academy is for this moment, and we will be ready.\"",

      "For United, he made his U18 debut at a mere 15 years old and now regularly graces the pitch for the U21s. In terms of stepping into a £71million Mbeumo's shoes, the youngster offers speed and flair down the right wing.",
      "Lacey also has the ability to transition into an attacking midfield role, a trait that will undoubtedly delight Amorim. While he may not have Mbeumo's physicality, Lacey compensates with his nimbleness and technical skills, effortlessly breezing past defenders. He's also earned a reputation as a free-kick maestro at academy level.",
      "Mantato has been part of the United family since he was just nine years old. Now 18, he has proven his mettle in high-pressure situations, including scoring a last-gasp winner to defeat Arsenal in the FA Youth Cup quarterfinals earlier this year.",
      "Born and bred in Manchester, Mantato can operate as either a forward or full-back. This adaptability fits perfectly into Amorim's strategy, which employs a back three and two offensive-minded full-backs who surge forward during counter-attacks.",
      "Much like £32.5m star Amad, Mantato is a skilled dribbler with blistering pace down the flank. These qualities, coupled with his versatility, make him a prime contender to fill the void left by Amad's temporary departure.",
      "Kamason became the first player from United's Emerging Talent Programme to secure a professional deal. Former U18 lead coach Adam Lawrence told The Athletic his position is \"predominantly as a full-back, but he likes to get forward and can affect the game higher up the pitch.\"",
      "This perfectly matches the type of full-back Amorim depends upon. Kamason possesses the ability to surge forward, skip past opponents and whip in threatening deliveries - qualities that would suit Benjamin Sesko and Matheus Cunha perfectly.",
      "He has also demonstrated his capability to cope with the physical demands of defending whilst switching seamlessly between defensive and attacking phases, and could make the perfect replacement for a £17.6m Mazraoui.",

The Manchester United legend was joined by the Liverpool icon for the latest episode of The Overlap this week, where the pair discussed their respective clubs and recent form in the top flight.",
      "When Carragher addressed Liverpool's defensive issues during their chat, he emphasised how Arne Slot must sign a centre-back in January. That gave Neville the chance to ask whether failing to do so would allow United to finish above their fierce rivals come the end of the campaign, with Carra less than impressed with the cheeky dig.",
      "He responded: \"I don't think so,\" before turning the ribbing back on Neville. He continued: \"You're desperate for that aren't you? He got ridiculed, didn't he, for his predictions? So, I'm well aware every week he's on the phone to people at Sky saying, 'Well, what did Cara say in the predictions? What what did they say?'\"",
      "Neville then dismissed Carragher's joke, responding: \"Well, my predictions, as we've established in the first day, Monday Night Football are more accurate than yours over time. But I actually think this season you're in a bit of trouble.\"",
      "In a lighthearted exchange, Carragher quipped: \"I'm going to lose my job or something because I got my predictions wrong?\" as the panel erupted in laughter. When Ian Wright asked what the pair were discussing, Neville explained: \"Well, he had Liverpool winning the league.",
      "\"I had United in the top four, didn't I? They could sneak into fifth. Do you reckon they could finish fifth? Get into the Champions League.\"",

      "Sesko suffered a knee injury during United's game against Spurs before the international break, and he's not expected to be back until December. Maguire also had to be substituted during the same match due to a hamstring problem, with Amorim confessing that he \"is not ready\" for the upcoming game.",
      "Mainoo, on the other hand, missed the Reds' match against Spurs entirely due to an injury, but there's a chance he could make an appearance at the Theatre of Dreams on Monday, depending on his recovery. In other news, Lisandro Martinez might finally make his much-anticipated return to Premier League action against the Toffees.",
      "The Argentinian defender has been out of action since February due to an ACL injury, but reports suggest he's close to regaining full fitness. The 27-year-old was back in full training ahead of the international break, but Amorim decided not to play him straight away.",
      "Despite not getting a call-up for his country, Martinez did join up with Argentina to train and continue his journey to full fitness during the break. Speaking about the chance of him playing on Monday evening, Amorim said: \"Licha is getting close to be playing,\" - a comment that will surely delight United fans across the globe.",

      "Manchester United are bracing themselves for disappointment in their bid to sign Karim Adeyemi. United have been keeping close tabs on the Borussia Dortmund forward, in the hope of luring him to Old Trafford.",
      "Club bosses have sounded out Adeyemi's agent, Jorge Mendes, about the chances of striking a deal next summer. But United manager Ruben Amorim is preparing to turn his attentions elsewhere, in his attempts to land a new goalscorer.",
      "Dortmund have slapped a £75m price-tag on the German international, which is more than what United were willing to pay.",
      "And to make matters worse, Adeyemi has made it clear that if he leaves Dortmund ahead of next season, his preferred destination is Arsenal and not United.",
      "Adeyemi, 23, is under contract until 2027, but talks with Dortmund over a new deal have stalled, and he is willing to find a new club in the summer.",
      "Earlier this week, the forward issued a public apology after he was charged and fined €450,000 due to being in possession of two illegal weapons - a knuckleduster and a taser.",
      "He issued a public statement on his Instagram to address the situation: \"You have probably seen the headlines about me in the last few days. It is not easy for me to talk about this. At the beginning of 2024, out of carelessness and without really thinking about what I was doing, I ordered a so-called ‘mystery box’ on the internet.",
      "\"It contained items that are not permitted under weapons legislation. Many months later, the package was delivered and ended up unopened at the police station.",
      "\"Nevertheless, it was a huge mistake. One that I am very sorry about, that cost me dearly and that I deeply regret. I know that I am in the public eye and have a role model function. I did not live up to that.",
      "\"That is precisely why it hurts me all the more that I acted so recklessly. I have learned more from this than I can put into words. And I promise you that I will avoid such mistakes in the future. Thank you to everyone who still trusts and supports me.\"",
      "Dortmund manager Niko Kovac confirmed the player will receive no additional punishment from the club and would not stop him from being named in forthcoming squads. “It is no reason for me to ban him for the next few weeks,\" Kovac explained.",
      "\"I am not his father, but his coach. People should put things into proper perspective. Everything has now been said about it. The focus is clearly on the Bundesliga. He will get our full support for that.”",

      "He told the club's website: \"You want to play at the weekend because of our fans. That is the main thing. I understand nowadays this is a business and we need to respect that also – the TV companies give us a lot of money to control that but I prefer to play at weekends because it’s a family moment. Old Trafford is always full, so it’s going to be a very good moment.”",
      "There is a feel good factor at the club, the like of which hasn't been seen during the Amorim era. But the Portuguese boss is in the midst of his best unbeaten run since being appointed with United winning three and drawing two of their past five matches. That has got the fans feeling optimistic, which has made playing at Old Trafford easier.",
      "Amorim claimed: \"In the recent past it was hard to play at home. But nowadays you miss playing at home, that is a feeling we should have in our club. I’m really excited to be back playing at home and the players also. We need to continue winning at home.”",

The ardent Manchester United supporter was unveiled as one of the 10 participants for the latest series of the ITV jungle show, following his rise to fame through online streaming.",
      "His breakthrough into mainstream media came after a standout performance in the Sidemen charity match, leading to his Soccer Aid debut at Old Trafford - just months before being selected for I'm a Celeb alongside his good mate and rapper Aitch. Angry Ginge, whose real name is Morgan Burtwistle, was known for filming himself at United games, but one particular clip sparked a significant backlash.",
      "On his YouTube channel, the Baller League manager frequently shares videos of his adventures playing Sunday League football and managing his Winton Yanited team.",
      "During United's 3-0 victory over Everton in November 2023, Ginge recorded himself participating in the contentious 'Feed the Scousers' chant in the away end - a video that garnered millions of views. The chant, set to the melody of the Christmas charity single 'Do They Know It's Christmas?' by Band Aid in 1984, makes light of food poverty.",
      "Following an overwhelming negative response, Ginge, who was brought up on a council estate and raised by his mother and nan, issued a heartfelt apology on his social media platforms after discussing with his Liverpudlian friends and understanding the meaning of the chant.",
      "\"I've just seen the tweets that are going around about the chant I sang at the Everton game,\" he penned. \"I'm so sorry I sang that chant, I got caught up in the moment and didn't think about what it actually meant.",
      "\"I've been told by some of my scouse mates that it's mocking poverty, and I want to say I'm so sorry I sang it and if I offended you. I've come from that background, on a council estate and ate £1 microwave meals every night.",
      "\"I 100% sympathise with you and I'm sorry, I genuinely meant nothing by it, I just got caught up. I'm so disappointed to be honest and I understand the anger, 100% because it's wrong, I did not mean to do it at all.\"",
      "Sporting his signature red Lightning McQueen crocs, Ginge had viewers in stitches from the very first episode. In the episode, he triumphed in a challenge to secure a place in the 'luxury getaway car' alongside Aitch, Eddie Kadi and Jack Osbourne.",
      "The victorious foursome were treated to steak for dinner and luxury beds upon their arrival in camp. Ginge has been put forward for the very first bushtucker trial, with both he and Ruby Wax participating in the first eating challenge at 'The Divey' in an attempt to win meals for camp. If he is chosen to undertake a second consecutive trial, he will then be exempt from the next one due to a new rule introduced for this year's show.",
      "Angry Ginge is capturing the hearts of a new generation during his stint in I'm A Celebrity, Get Me Out Of Here, and his latest confession about being sober has even more people praising him.",
      "In the comments, someone wrote: \"I loved seeing the conversation around sobriety (as someone is over two years in) and how they were all so honest and open about it. Hopefully it makes a difference to someone younger than me!\"",
      "Another gushed: \"Angry Ginge is HUGE for the younger male demographic. He’s a fantastic role model and on a program that’s extremely popular. Both my daughters are in relationships with boys (18 & 20), and they are far too cool to watch this usually. However, both are LOCKED IN to watch Angry Ginge and defo agree with what you say\".",
      "And a third said: \"He's absolutely brilliant. My 14-year-old boy absolutely loves him. And has actually been watching I'm a Celeb with me. He barely comes out of his room normally. Ginge is an absolute sweetheart, so is Aitch, two great role models for young men and teenage boys\".",

Rashford has rediscovered his best form and has started the last 10 matches in all competitions for his club, but that run will now come to an end.",
      "Rashford has scored six goals and come up with a further eight assists since making his loan move. The Englishman has found himself a home on the left with Raphinha absent through injury.",
      "The German said on Friday: \"Marcus has fever, so he was out [of training] yesterday and today. There are some doubts if he is back tomorrow.\"",

      "Flick said: \"The good news is Raphinha is back. I appreciate a lot what he can give the team. We will see tomorrow if 10, 15 or 20 minutes, but he's back and it's a big step for him to come back and be on the bench tomorrow.\"",
      "It is not yet January but Rashford is determined to earn himself a move to Barcelona on a permanent basis, unless his situation in Manchester changes.

      "United landed Sesko for £74million, following a transfer battle with Newcastle, and his running metres proved crucial in that decision, reports The Times. It is an area of growth the club are targeting and that approach is led by the summer recruit Mike Sansoni who joined the club as director of data after spending 11 years with the Mercedes Formula 1 team.",
      "Sansoni works closely with Wilcox and is leading a push at United which will see them become a “fully data-driven club which will lead to success on and off the pitch”. He has access to data models capable of listing the data of tens of thousands of players.",
      "The cub believe they are among the leaders in that field, which ultimately led to the signing of Sesko. The jury is still out on the ex-RB Leipzig frontman but those concerns are not shared by those in Manchester.",
      "He has only scored twice for the club. Gyokeres has copped similar criticism after a slow start that has seen him scored four times. But Amorim and co are satisfied with his movement off the ball and his attitude during the week is that of a player determined to make his mark.",
      "Sesko, as well as Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha, all showed a willingness to join the Manchester outfit, which was seen as another big plus. Sesko could've headed to St James' Park with Newcastle also keen on Mbeumo, who had another offer from Tottenham.",
      "Amorim accepts that Sesko will be concerned with his form, but he's confident in the striker. He said: \"I'm relaxed, he's not relaxed. I understand how things are in football and he's going to struggle. That is normal. He has no experience here.\"",

      "Ruben Amorim has challenged Manuel Ugarte to improve in training sessions amid concerns about his performances for Manchester United this season. Ugarte got off to a mixed start in Manchester after his €50million (£42.3m) transfer, with a further €10m (£8.5m) in add-ons, from Paris Saint-Germain in the summer of 2024.",
      "The midfielder was expected to improve after the appointment of Amorim. Ugarte played his best football under Amorim at Sporting Lisbon, but he's been unable to reproduce those levels so far at Old Trafford. Ugarte has made just two starts in the Premier League this season.",
      "The 24-year-old has played just 346 minutes across 10 appearances (seven from the bench) in all competitions. Amorim was asked whether he was surprised by Ugarte's form and challenged him to improve. \"No, I understand. If, again.. you are here [Manchester] longer than me, and you can sense that a lot of very good players come here, and sometimes they struggle,\" said Amorim.",
      "\"And they are struggling, he is struggling in the moment. But it is our job to try to help our players, and again, everything can change. And you saw it five weeks ago, the environment was completely different.",
      "\"So I know that Ugarte is struggling in the moment and my job is trying to help him to feel as a player, like I felt when he was a Sporting player, for example. But it is a different world and he needs to adapt and he needs to improve, especially in training.\"",
      "There has been speculation around Ugarte's future. Amorim was ruthless last summer, deciding Rasmus Hojlund should leave after a disappointing campaign. Benjamin Sesko has been sidelined with a knee injury, but Amorim does not regret allowing Hojlund to join Napoli.",
      "\"Our thinking is that we need two strikers,\" he said. \"Sometimes I prefer players that make two positions, because sometimes in these clubs it's hard to make everyone happy.",
      "\"Imagine that Rasmus is here, and you say if Ben has an injury, you have more time to play. It's impossible to manage a dressing room like that, so that's why we need to improve the kids from academy.",
      "\"If you have an injury, that is the opportunity for them, and then to have players that can play in different positions, for us to manage the team in a better way.\"",
      "Sesko picked up his knee injury against Tottenham before the international break. He was introduced from the bench in the 58th minute in London but he lasted just half an hour.",
      "The 22-year-old was forced to withdraw from international duty with Slovenia and underwent scans at Carrington during the break, which confirmed the injury was not a major issue.",
      "Amorim was asked to provide an update on Sesko's injury during his press conference on Friday, and said: \"He is going to stay a few weeks out. I don’t know how long, but it’s not that serious. We have to be careful with him. He is going to recover and he is feeling better.\"",

Lacey and Fletcher took part in first-team training at Carrington on Friday morning, suggesting they have a chance of being named in the matchday squad when Everton visit Old Trafford.",
      "Kobbie Mainoo was ruled out of facing Tottenham before the international break due to a knock, which opened the door for Fletcher to come into the first-team squad in London. Fletcher’s inclusion continued United's 88-year record of naming an academy graduate in every matchday squad.",
      "Darren Fletcher's son has made progress since joining from Manchester City two years ago, and has acquitted himself well playing against senior opposition in the EFL Trophy and National League Cup. Lacey is pushing towards making a senior debut. The 18-year-old has always been one of the most highly regarded talents in his age group and has consistently performed in this campaign.",
      "Amorim spoke to reporters at a press conference on Friday. Speaking about losing players to AFCON, he said: \"I think it's going to be hard, but then that is the good thing of the experience, we lived so many limitations last year, because we changed in January, and we didn't bring the players.",
      "\"And then we had the injury of Amad for four months, all these things, so we are prepared for that, even it will be hard for us, but we have a different baggage to deal with that. And again, I think guys like Jack Fletcher, Shea, a lot of guys, they can step up, and we can send at the same time a message to everyone here, in the academy, that this is the future. But we are going to struggle and we have to be prepared for that.\"",
      "Amorim added of Lacey's development: \"I'm really happy with him. I think he struggled a little bit with injuries, they did a very good job balancing his body, you can sense that he can manage more load during training.",
      "\"He has a lot of talent, but when they come here, they can sense the speed is completely different, so they need to spend more time with us to be prepared, because our trainings are hard, at Premier League games, with the pressure it's harder, so they need to be ready.\"",
      "Chido Obi made seven appearances in the Premier League last season, but the young striker has not been named in a senior squad so far this term. Obi has played for the Under-21s, developing away from the spotlight, and Amorim believes he was overexposed last term due to injuries.",
      "\"Yeah, of course, he played last year,\" Amorim said about whether Obi was someone who could step up. \"I think it was too soon, we didn't have a team. That we can put a young kid with 16, that he will not struggle, or will struggle a little bit, was completely necessary to do that.",
      "\"The perfect conditions. We have the opportunity and we seek that opportunity for the kids, so he's one of the guys, but I think he started too soon. And sometimes it's hard to deal with that, with the kids, because they think that I'm already here. No, you are here for necessity and we need to be careful also with that.\"",
      "Speaking about trusting young players, Amorim said: \"First of all, I'm not preparing the academy, they are preparing the academy, we are paying more attention to them, we are talking with them.",
      "\"Just that is so important for us, to change information about the players, what they need, how they behave, even to call a kid for the first team, they need to behave really well, if you don't behave really well. This connection is really important, we are trying to do that, we are putting everything in place.",
      "\"Nutritionist for the academy starts now, in our club. That is something that should be basic, so all these things we are doing, and they are doing their job, so I have more times with them, with training.",
      "\"So I'm more confident with them, when we put these kids to play in Premier League, they will struggle, but will struggle less I think, so I think everyone in the academy, are doing a very good job in the moment.\"",
      "\"Because he's had exposure with the first-team, I think people expect performance levels that are really consistent and really high. You've got first-team players across the country who don't do that.",
      "\"The expectation on him is high, but he has to deliver the basics, and what he did from minute 30 to 80 when he came off is he pressed, he ran and he occupied two centre halves to give other players space on the pitch to exploit, which is why we dominated the ball.",
      "\"They [City] will say they are not scared of him, but they defended two versus one against him all day. I'm pleased he got his goal because you can toil up there, not touch it, not do a lot, but he got his goal and set us on our way. I'm really pleased with him and we haven't even scraped the top of the iceberg with him. He's got loads to come.",
      "\"That will come from how he sees the game, keeps working hard and recognises he has stuff to develop because that's always a challenge when you have that first-team exposure and then you go away and have to start working on things.\"",
      "Obi must continue to work hard to earn first-team involvement. \"When you score as many goals as he has throughout his relatively short life, you can define yourself by goals,\" said Binnion.",
      "\"And we all know there's probably only two or three strikers in the world who get two goals in every three games. If you're used to scoring two goals in every game, then recognising what the role is, how you have to go around it takes a little bit of time. He is dying to be a footballer.",
      "\"He is hungry. And he's still learning the game, learning how to project himself and learning how to play within a team, the club's shape and system, so there's still lots for him to do.",
      "\"The key is he wants to play, he wants to do well and wants to train. He could train every day if he could.\"",

      "Manchester United head coach Ruben Amorim could be forced to think outside of the box tonight as the Reds welcome Everton to Old Trafford. United are five games unbeaten in the Premier League and after defeats for the likes of Liverpool and Manchester City this weekend, Amorim will be hopeful his side can close the gap on those at the top.",
      "If they are going to do that, they will need to manage without Benjamin Sesko. The centre-forward picked up a knee injury in the draw against Tottenham Hotspur and is out for a few weeks.",
      "Matheus Cunha could also be missing after he suffered a training ground knock. The Brazilian had been expected to turn on the Christmas lights in Altrincham on Saturday evening but the organisers announced he had pulled out due to medical reasons.",
      "So with potentially two absentees in the forward line, we could see a new role for Bryan Mbeumo. The Cameroonian has played as a No.10 since moving to Old Trafford but in the potential absence of Cunha and Sesko, Amorim could be tempted to have Mbeumo leading the line for United.",
      "If this is the thinking, we can expect Mason Mount and Amad to play just behind him. Amad spent last season as the Reds' No.10 but has excelled in the right wing-back role this term.",
      "The Ivorian's main strength remains his ability to attack so reverting back to the No.10 role should be no hardship. Noussair Mazraoui remains a solid option to fill in while Amad is being utilised further up the pitch.",
      "On the left flank, it is a toss up between Patrick Dorgu and Diogo Dalot. Dorgu was favoured in the draw at Spurs and we expect the same to happen again on Monday night.",
      "Dalot does not seem comfortable on the left and Dorgu is certainly the future in that role. The Dane impressed last week for his country and Amorim will hope he can utilise this form for United.",
      "United predicted XI vs Everton: Lammens; Yoro, De Ligt, Shaw; Mazraoui, Fernandes, Casemiro, Dorgu; Amad, Mount; Mbeumo",

      "Manchester United will welcome Everton to Old Trafford on Monday night with the hope of pushing closer towards the European spots. After an awful start to the season, Ruben Amorim has overseen an impressive turnaround, and he picked up the manager of the month award for October after three wins on the bounce.",
      "United began November by drawing against Nottingham Forest and Tottenham. The Reds salvaged a point against Spurs before the international break thanks to a headed added-time goal from Matthijs de Ligt.",
      "Everton have made an indifferent start to the campaign and are struggling to score goals, but they secured a 2-0 victory against Fulham at the Hill Dickinson Stadium before the international break. They have only won once away from home all season - at Wolverhampton Wanderers.",
      "Regarding the team news, Benjamin Sesko has been ruled out with a knee injury and Harry Maguire appeared to be ruled out after missing training on Friday. Kobbie Mainoo was expected to take part in training on Saturday after missing the session the day before.",
      "Here's how our writers think United should line up...",
      "The biggest team news headline was the update on Sesko, who picked up a knee injury against Tottenham last weekend. Sesko started on the bench against Spurs, which means Amorim can pick the same attack if he likes, but it makes sense to drop Amad to right wing-back and play Mount.",
      "Amad looked better when he was moved to that role at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium and Mount created two chances when he came on from the bench in the second half.",
      "Dorgu was recalled to the starting team in London and scored for Denmark during the break. There isn't much between Dalot and Dorgu because they've both been unconvincing, but I'd give the latter the nod.",
      "Doubts surrounding the fitness of Matheus Cunha will have raised alarm bells for United heading into this one. The Reds still have a few options in attack and could choose not to risk the Brazilian.",
      "Playing Bryan Mbeumo as the false nine will be a new role for him at Old Trafford but it is a position he has played before. This would allow Amad and Mount to play behind him and not risk the Brazilian.",
      "Playing Dorgu at left wing-back seems the most likely choice. Dalot is not comfortable on the left and the Dane's performance during the international break was good.",

      "The Reds have enjoyed a promising start to the season, but there's plenty of work still to be done if they're to qualify for the UEFA Champions League. Ruben Amorim's side slipped to 10th over the weekend, but they could climb into the top four if they defeat Everton this evening.",
      "United will certainly fancy their chances, having not lost any of their last five games, winning three and drawing the other two. The Toffees have done well under David Moyes this term, but they've not beaten the Reds at Old Trafford since December 2013.",
      "While Amorim gears up for another gruelling fixture-filled festive period, he'll be hoping United higher-ups are preparing for a busy January transfer window. Antoine Semenyo and Joao Gomes have recently been linked with moves, while Kobbie Mainoo still faces an uncertain future.",
      "The Reds will also need to factor in the departures of Bryan Mbeumo, Amad Diallo and Noussair Mazraoui, who are all set to feature at the Africa Cup of Nations next month. The tournament gets underway until December 21, with the final taking place on January 18.",
      "According to The Mirror, it's 'highly unlikely' that Arsenal will sign Antoine Semenyo in the January transfer window. It was recently revealed that the Bournemouth forward has a release clause in his contract, currently worth £65m, which will decrease at the end of the season.",
      "The report has named Liverpool and Tottenham Hotspur as potential suitors for the time being. Semenyo signed a new long-term contract at the Vitality Stadium in the summer, keeping him at the Cherries until at least June 2030.",
      "At the end of last month, Ruben Amorim revealed that he expects out-of-favour players to hand in transfer requests in the coming weeks. As quoted by ESPN, the United boss said: \"A lot of things can happen.",
      "\"Even in our club, and you know that we have World Cup, some players are not playing, they will ask to leave, so I have to manage everything.\"",
      "Amorim refused to rule out the possibility of strengthening his squad over the festive period. He added: \"We want to bring players, everyone here, we want to bring players that we can see a big future in Manchester United.",
      "\"We are not just buying one guy, because now we feel in December that we need this kind of player for now. No, it's going to be... we want to buy players that we know we are not going to change a lot of times. So that is our idea.",
      "\"I don't know what is going to happen, but of course we think about how we can improve the team, and in January the window is open, we can do something.\"",
      "According to Brazilian outlet Trivela, as quoted by GiveMeSport, United are 'close' to reaching an agreement to sign Joao Gomes from Wolves. The report claims that Ruben Amorim is keen to bring the 24-year-old midfielder to Old Trafford.",
      "It's said that the Reds are in the market for a new midfielder, with Casemiro expected to leave when his contract expires in the summer.",
      "According to the Sunday Mirror, Karim Adeyemi has set his sights on joining Arsenal. The Borussia Dortmund forward has been linked with a move to the Premier League on numerous occasions in the past, but a deal has never materialised.",
      "The report claims United have made contact with his agent, Jorge Mendes, to enquire about a potential move in the summer. Adeyemi has less than two years remaining on his contract at the Signal Iduna Park.",
      "According to CaughtOffside, Arsenal are closely monitoring Scott McTominay’s situation at Napoli. The report claims that Mikel Arteta wants to 'add steel' to his midfield in the January transfer window, so the Gunners have identified the Scot as an option.",
      "It's said that the Italian champions have no intention of letting McTominay go easily, with the club president, Aurelio De Laurentiis, setting an asking price of £60m. CaughtOffside reckons that 'only a substantial offer' will prise the former United ace from Naples.",
      "McTominay is reportedly happy in Italy, settled in Conte's project, and not actively pushing for a move...",
      "Ruben Amorim has named three United youngsters who could be given a chance to play over the festive period. When quizzed on the Africa Cup of Nations, the Reds boss said: \"I think it's going to be hard, but then that is the good thing of the experience.",
      "\"We lived so many limitations last year, because we changed in January, and we didn't bring the players, and then we had the injury of Amad [Diallo] for four months.",
      "\"All these things, so we are prepared for that, even it will be hard for us, but we have a different baggage to deal with that, and again, I think guys like Jack Fletcher, Shea [Lacey], a lot of guys, they can step up.",
      "\"We can send at the same time a message to everyone here, in the academy, that this is the future, but we are going to struggle, and we have to be prepared for that.\"",
      "Amorim also mentioned Chido Obi, who United poached from Arsenal last year...",
      "Man United duo Kobbie Mainoo and Joshua Zirkzee have fallen down the pecking order at Old Trafford in recent months.",
      "As a result, both the midfielder and striker were linked with summer departures and rumours of potential exits have not subsided as the January transfer window nears.",
      "Speaking to the media ahead of Monday night's Premier League clash with Everton, the United boss addressed his player's situation.",
      "\"I was a football player,\" Amorim said. \"I understand everything, and I want to help my players in every situation.",
      "\"I understand the frustration of some players, seeing the World Cup is there. I know what it means.",
      "\"But the first thing is that the club comes first. If I can help the club and the players, I will be happy. If not I have to think about the team.\"",
      "Manchester United are ahead of their rivals in the chase for Ajax wonderkid Jorthy Mokio, it has been rumoured.",
      "According to Caught Offside, United, Tottenham and Newcastle are among the clubs monitoring the 17-year-old's situation in Amsterdam.",
      "The article notes he is regarded as one of the finest young talents on the continent, and the Red Devils are leading the rase.",
      "It adds that the Manchester club are already working on a project to present to the player, offering guaranteed minutes and a clear development path.",
      "Manchester United are adopting a similar strategy to Harry Maguire's contract extension while negotiating fresh terms with midfielder Casemiro, according to the latest reports.",
      "Speaking on his YouTube channel, journalist Fabrizio Romano provided an update on the midfielder's future at Old Trafford with his contract ticking towards an end.",
      "While there is an acknowledgement he has been crucial to the team's resurgence this season, the financial aspects of a new deal currently present a stumbling block.",
      "\"Guys, my understanding is that the situation of Casemiro is a really similar situation in terms of strategy to Harry Maguire,\" Romano explained.",
      "“Casemiro and Maguire are out of contract in summer 2026. And for Manchester United, they are two really important players.",
      "“Especially now Casemiro, we have to say congrats to Casemiro in this video because he’s been able to change his situation at Manchester United.",
      "“So now the desire is from United obviously to continue with Casemiro but on different conditions. The salary he has right now is a salary that Manchester United don’t want to pay in the future.",
      "\"Not because of Casemiro or Maguire but because they want to change the salary structure. So at the moment for Casemiro eventually the only way to stay would be a different contract, a different salary.",
      "\"Otherwise he could be free next summer to go wherever he wants. He always had a lot of interest especially from Saudi Arabia.",
      "“So after his excellent performances recently, Casemiro obviously will have many clubs interested. But at the moment that’s the situation with Casemiro. Nothing guaranteed in terms of new contract because of the salary.",
      "“They need to find a solution on the salary structure together club and player, they have to try to find common ground on this point otherwise Casemiro could be leaving Manchester United in summer 2026.\"",
      "Few new signings at Manchester United have had the same immediate impact as Bryan Mbeumo in recent history, writes Jack Flintham.",
      "Brentford's talisman arrived at Old Trafford keen to pick up where he left off and has managed to do just that with six goals in 12 appearances. He has hit the ground running and the sky should be the limit for the 26-year-old.",
      "However, what could temper his momentum is the Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON). This winter, Mbeumo will join up with his Cameroon teammates for the continental competition and AFCON has proven to be a problem for Premier League clubs for many years now.",
      "Read the story here.",
      "New Wolves manager Rob Edwards has said that he is 'not aware' of any approaches for midfielder Joao Gomes.",

      "Amorim confirmed that Maguire is \"not ready\" to feature against Everton on Monday night, and it remains to be seen when the England international will make his return to the squad.",
      "Kobbie Mainoo faces a race against time to be fit to face the Toffees. The midfielder was unavailable for the draw with Tottenham before the international break due to a knock.",
      "The 20-year-old will have to prove his fitness, in order to have a place in the squad.",
      "The Portuguese head coach admitted that Mainoo had yet to return to training as of Friday, but he had hopes that the midfielder would be back involved before the clash against Everton.",
      "\"Kobbie didn't train today but I think tomorrow we could see Kobbie so we will see,\" said Amorim.",
      "Lisandro Martinez is still on the comeback trail as he continues his recovery from the knee injury which he suffered in February.",
      "The issue was severe enough for the Argentine to undergo surgery and since then, he has been building up his fitness in order to return to the starting 11.",
      "Amorim said recently that he hopes to have the Argentina international back on the pitch in the near future.",
      "\"He needs more time to work there, and he is not working there, but in an emergency, he can play, but I am not thinking about that,\" said Amorim.",
      "\"I feel Licha is becoming close to being able to play. We need to be careful, he is going to struggle in the first minutes but he is clearly in a better position than he was two weeks ago.\"",
      "As for Everton, one-time United transfer target Jarrad Branthwaite is out as is fellow defender Nathan Patterson. Merlin Rohl (hernia) is also set to miss out after undergoing surgery in the international break.",

      "Plenty of mistakes have been made since Ineos took control of football operations at Manchester United. Often the communication with supporters has been poor and Sir Jim Ratcliffe's treatment of fans when it comes to ticket prices and other matters has been rightly criticised.",
      "However, one area that has improved has been the recruiting and selling of players. Of course, not every piece of business will be universally welcomed but at least there seems to be a method which United are looking to implement in the transfer market.",
      "Sporting director Jason Wilcox explained this on a recent episode of the Inside Carrington podcast. He said: \"Last year’s summer window was a lot more chaotic than this one. This one was really calm, we knew the plan, we knew which players we were going to target, we had our lists, we knew which areas of the pitch we needed to improve.",
      "\"These are continuous meetings between myself and Ruben [Amorim] with Chris Vivell and his team underneath. We are very clear on the profiles that we need. The brief will come from myself and Ruben, it goes into Chris.",
      "\"[There is] a lot of debate and discussion around the profiles of what we need and then the scouts will go into the market. We combine that with the data team and there will be constant dialogue. Right now, I am having weekly meetings with the recruitment team of the profiles, the age bracket, the cost, are they attainable with Ruben as well. It is a really joined up approach.\"",
      "This is a world away from the recruitment plan under Erik ten Hag. At times it seemed as though he was solely responsible for identifying possible targets.",
      "While some of his ex-players have proven to be decent buys - Lisandro Martinez started well and Matthijs de Ligt is getting better every week - many others fell short of the required standard. But if Wilcox is true to his word and the manager still has a say in recruitment, the board need to listen to what Amorim had to say this week.",
      "Amorim was asked why his team's level was dropping off in the second half of matches. In response, the Portuguese head coach highlighted two players' absences - two players who could no longer be with the Reds at the start of next season.",
      "He said: \"I think we have some problems in two games that we lost, we lose Casemiro with some pain, Harry Maguire the same thing, and they are key players. Not just the way they play and the experience they have, the set pieces and people don’t take that into consideration.\"",
      "The United duo are both out of contract at the end of the season. As things stand, neither man will be staying beyond then. Casemiro has stated he wishes to continue playing football beyond this campaign. Despite United having an option to extend his contract by a further 12 months, the Reds would rather negotiate a new deal to lower his salary.",
      "United have already used the option to extend his stay by a further 12 months and so a new deal would need to be struck. United will likely want to lower his wages to reflect the amount of playing time he will have beyond 2026.",
      "Maguire seems the most likely to stay at present but if one, or both, of these players leave Old Trafford in 2026, United have a job on their hands to replace them. Amorim knows neither man is the future of United but what they both have shown is that the team looks weaker when they are not on the pitch.",
      "This should have alarm bells ringing inside Old Trafford. Replacing players with such Premier League and European experience will be a difficult task and this interview alone has ensured the issue has been flagged early.",
      "If both end up leaving, United will need to replace them with quality, experienced players. If they are not able to, they risk losing key squad depth for 2026/27.",

      "Few new signings at Manchester United have had the same immediate impact as Bryan Mbeumo in recent history. Brentford's talisman arrived at Old Trafford keen to pick up where he left off and has managed to do just that with six goals in 12 appearances.",
      "After the brace against Brighton and Hove Albion, Mbeumo refused to limit himself to a target of 20 goals which he achieved last season and who could blame him? He has hit the ground running and the sky should be the limit for the 26-year-old.",
      "However, what could temper his momentum is the Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON). This winter, Mbeumo will join up with his Cameroon teammates for the continental competition. AFCON has proven to be a problem for Premier League clubs for many years now. While no manager wants to stand in the way of their player representing their nation on the biggest stage, the timing of the tournament means it will impact domestic clubs, particularly United who will not only lose Mbeumo but also Amad and Noussair Mazraoui.",
      "That is why Ruben Amorim spoke about his desire to keep Mbeumo and Co for longer than the usual cut off period. He said: \"We have the rules, when we have to release the players, so we will see.",
      "\"We are doing our job to try and maintain the players a little bit longer, but it is not just in our hands. We need to respect that, but we will try to do everything to protect the club, protect the players and protect the national team.",
      "\"I think it is two weeks before the start [they have to leave]. So, we will try to arrange something with the federations, but we need to respect their rules in this case.\"",
      "Ultimately Amorim is right. The issue is firmly out of his hands considering Cameroon and the other federations hold all the cards. Thankfully for Amorim, Cameroon have already shown they are willing to grant his wish. Ahead of the last AFCON, Erik ten Hag managed to delay Andre Onana's exit to the tournament until the day before it began.",
      "This meant Onana only missed the victory over Newport County in the FA Cup and was able to retain his place in the Premier League upon his return. Onana was expected with his national team two weeks before the tournament.",
      "But Cameroon were willing to be flexible although their reasoning will be a warning to the Reds. It is believed the African nation were understanding because Onana had retired from international football when he was initially signed by United.",
      "The keeper reversed his decision as Onana's relationship with the Cameroon federation was repaired and, as such, United's request was granted as they pitied the predicament Ten Hag found himself in. This is not the same for Mbeumo. Whatever happens, Mbeumo will be missed for however games he is absent.",

      "Nobody would have believed this statement at the start of the season, but Luke Shaw can be classed as one of the best players of the season so for Manchester United. Ignoring the Manchester City defeat, where nobody covered themselves in glory, Shaw has been a dependable option for Ruben Amorim.",
      "His reliability has been missing in recent years. In the 2024/25 season, he missed 294 days due to three injuries. The season prior it was 239 days and there were question marks over whether he would stay fit long enough to contribute to the cause.",
      "And yet, his redemption arc has been spectacular in the 2025/26 campaign. He has started every single Premier League fixture for Amorim and is settled on the left of the back three in Lisandro Martinez's absence.",
      "None of this could have been expected at the end of last season but it is a credit to the medical team and Shaw that he has managed to become a regular again. However, this could all unravel if Amorim goes with the idea he floated in his pre-Everton press conference when asked whether Shaw could play at left wing-back.",
      "\"He can play left wing-back but of course the load that a player does in that position is a little different if you are doing that on a daily basis,\" Amorim said.",
      "\"He is more prepared to do that position but of course he can play there, he is a smart player and he is fit in the moment so I think he is an option.\" In a way, you can see why Amorim would come to that conclusion.",
      "Naturally, Shaw is a full-back but he has suffered a lot of injuries since last playing on the flank. He has had to adapt his style of play and is impressing in the less physically demanding role of left centre-back.",
      "Amorim said it himself in his press conference, the load a player at wing-back has to take on is much more than what he is doing now and would stretch Shaw's body to the maximum, increasing the chances of an injury.",
      "Even if United were confident Shaw has overcome past issues, now is not the time to trial him at wing back. United are about to enter their busiest period of the campaign and it would be asking for trouble to shift Shaw out wide.",

      "“Very impressed, very impressed, and sometimes even a little bit surprised,\" said Bristol City manager Gerhard Struber about Manchester United loanee Radek Vitek last month. \"He’s young, and he looks like an outstanding, experienced Championship goalkeeper.”",
      "The general rule with United loans is that they send players with a genuine chance of contributing to the first team at Old Trafford on loan to the Championship. Vitek and Toby Collyer are currently playing in the division. Alvaro Fernandez and Amad were success stories at Preston and Sunderland respectively.",
      "The Championship is an unforgiving 46-game campaign, and young players must demonstrate resilience and quality to be successful in the division.",
      "Vitek has shown a lot of quality since he signed for Bristol City on a season-long loan. The goalkeeper has started every league game, kept five clean sheets and has won huge praise from their fans.",
      "He made the perfect first impression after signing on loan, saving a penalty in Bristol City's final pre-season game, and has not looked back.",
      "\"Of course, signing a player from Manchester United always brings with it a sense of excitement, but the 22-year-old was certainly an unknown quantity when he arrived.",
      "\"A penalty save and clean sheet in his first, and only, friendly for the Robins against Real Valladolid impressed those in attendance, and Vitek has only improved from that point on.",
      "\"His opening day display away to Sheffield United was superb as he commanded his penalty area brilliantly and pulled off a handful of smart stops from a variety of different scenarios.",
      "\"While you would expect a young goalkeeper to potentially be a bit of a rabbit in the headlights in what is an incredibly physical Championship this season, Vitek has looked like a veteran stopper in England’s second tier.\"",
      "He continued: \"Barring one uncharacteristic error in the 5-1 defeat to Stoke City, Vitek has been brilliant. It isn’t an exaggeration to suggest he has single-handedly won points on several occasions.",
      "\"He has produced multiple match-deciding stops at crucial points of matches. Vitek has kept five clean sheets over the course of his first 15 matches in red and white, and you could argue he deserves more.",
      "\"Against the likes of Charlton, Norwich City, Birmingham City and Hull City, it was his work between the posts as much as that of the attackers at the other end of the pitch that proved to be the difference, with his showing against the Addicks in particular a real standout.",
      "\"The fans have taken to him, as displayed by his interactions with away ends. The fact that he has kept Max O’Leary out of the team - the goalkeeper who played all 46 matches last season as the Reds ended their 17-year wait for a top six finish - speaks volumes to just how impressed Struber has been so far.\"",
      "Vitek cut his teeth on loan with Accrington Stanley in the second half of 2023/24. He joined the League Two club in the winter window and made 18 starts in the league, helping to guide them to safety.",
      "When Vitek reported for pre-season at Carrington after that loan, he started in a United friendly against Rosenborg in Norway and delivered a man-of-the-match performance.",
      "He told MUTV: \"It's really good for youngsters to get the opportunity, but when you step on the field you have to show yourself because it's a big chance in front of a lot of people.\"",
      "When asked about what it was like to represent United in pre-season, Vitek smiled and added: \"It's an amazing feeling, the fans are absolutely amazing and it was a full stadium of red shirts.\"",
      "Vitek was named in the 29-man travelling squad for the United States tour, but he was sent on a season-long loan to Austrian club FC Blau-Weiß Linz after returning to Manchester.",
      "During his unveiling, FC Blau-Weiß Linz's sporting director said: \"With Radek, we are getting a very talented young goalkeeper who has already gained a lot of experience in England and is, among other things, part of the goalkeeping team of Manchester United's first team.\"",
      "Vitek started almost every league game for FC Blau-Weiß Linz, only missing three matches due to an injury. His loan was a resounding success and FC Blau-Weiß Linz wanted to re-sign him on loan this summer.",
      "Speaking in June, United academy goalkeeper coach Tommy Lee said: “Radek has done great in Austria. He got an injury early on but recovered extremely well and played really well.",
      "\"He has got really good experience there. I think we often use Radek as an example to some of the younger goalkeepers. He is a player who maximises every part of the programme to ensure he is the best he can possibly be. Nutrition, gym, analysis. He is the consummate professional.",
      "\"That is going to take him, I believe, to the top level. He is a talented boy and that needs to be said. He’s 6ft 6ins, which always helps. For the other lads, their challenge is to be as good as Radek and do everything he does and more. He is a great example of someone who does that.\"",
      "Bristol City was chosen as the best destination for Vitek to take the next step in his career, and he signed a new contract with United, expiring in 2028, before moving south to Ashton Gate for this season.",
      "Carter explained: \"United fans will have likely seen the clip of the ridiculous save Radek Vitek made to deny Oli McBurnie from close range in City’s win over Hull City back in October.",
      "\"He got down well to claw a low header off the line and away from danger, a stop you wouldn’t imagine someone his size could make, and it was just one of multiple key saves in that contest.",
      "\"His intervention to deny Norwich City’s Jack Stacey at Carrow Road may have been even better, however. Stacey had peeled into space in the centre of the penalty area and wrapped his foot around a cut-back to fire a shot towards the bottom right corner.",
      "\"Despite having an obscured view, Vitek took off to his left and got down well to not only get a big hand on the bouncing shot but also push it into the path of Neto Borges, who could hack clear.",
      "\"Struber said after that win at Carrow Road that even he was surprised at times by just what Vitek was capable of. I am probably forgetting other impressive saves, but the fact that there are quite so many to pick from is a testament to just how good Vitek has been during his loan.\"",
      "Discussing Vitek's strengths and weaknesses, Carter said: \"He is a really good shot-stopper. Whether it be when reacting to close-range efforts or when dealing with looping shots from range, he seems to have the answer more often than not.",
      "\"If you were to look back at the goals he has conceded so far this season, you’d do well to suggest he could have done much better with all but a handful of them.",
      "\"When it comes to commanding his box, he uses every inch of his frame to deal well with high balls, whether that be from open play or set-pieces. It has been clear this season just how much more comfortable Bristol City have been when defending corners, and a large part of that has been their goalkeeper’s willingness to leave his line and deal with looping balls.",
      "\"It is challenging to identify a major weakness, but I think you could make a compelling argument that distribution is Vitek’s primary area for improvement.",
      "\"He can kick the ball further than most goalkeepers I’ve seen at Ashton Gate, and he has pulled off a couple of smart - if concerning - Cruyff turns, but he has probably kicked goal kicks into touch a bit too often. He is by no means terrible with the ball at his feet, but he could be a bit more polished.\"",
      "When asked whether Vitek could play in the Premier League, he added: \"Absolutely. Bristol City have signed several players on loan from Premier League clubs over the years, and although it is still early days, Radek Vitek has been one of the most impressive.",
      "\"Vitek has been one of the division’s best shot stoppers and he is excellent when it comes to commanding his box. Naturally, given his age and lack of top-flight experience, he has room to improve, but you would struggle to find a Bristol City fan who wasn’t confident that Vitek will play in the Premier League.",
      "\"Of course, it will depend on what Manchester United plan to do with him come the end of his time at Ashton Gate, but I would imagine his performances will have caught the eye of some Premier League sides.",
      "\"Whether it be at Old Trafford, another club, or hopefully, in another loan spell with the Robins after helping them win promotion this term, I’d expect Vitek to be playing top-flight football next season.\"",
      "\"It was the best thing to do and get more experience at a higher level than last year. It was a no-brainer because to play in the Championship for a club such as Bristol City for me was really attractive. I said yes straight away after I spoke with Gerhard Struber.\"",
      "Vitek continued: \"I'm still quite young, but I would describe myself as a goalkeeper who likes to be both dominant and also confident for the team in front of me so they can rely on me.",
      "\"Everything since day one has come together. The people around the club, the city… everyone has been really nice to me since day one and the fans have been amazing. The first game away from home... to celebrate the win like that was an amazing memory. I don't think I'll ever forget it.\"",
      "He went on to discuss his hopes of playing for United. \"I'm taking it step-by-step and we'll see next summer what's best for me,\" he said. \"I speak on a regular basis with my goalkeeper coach from Manchester United who has come here to watch my games and I have a good connection with them.",
      "\"I know they're watching me and I really appreciate that I'm not just the guy who is being forgotten or anything. Obviously long term, I would love to play for Manchester United one day, but also I'm realistic and I know that my pathway can lead somewhere different as well.\"",
      "Vitek has huge potential and could challenge Senne Lammens for the No.1 spot next season.",

      "Former Manchester United star Marcus Rashford has issued the perfect response to ex-teammate Paul Pogba's emotional statement. That's following the midfielder's long-awaited comeback to football.",
      "Pogba, 32, has had two spells with United throughout his career, initially as a youth prospect before he re-joined the club in 2016 from Juventus for a then world-record fee. Rashford, meanwhile, is a product of United's academy - although he's currently out on loan with La Liga giants Barcelona.",
      "Pogba departed Old Trafford for the final time in 2022 following the expiration of his contract and returned to Juventus as a free agent. However, in his second season back in Turin, he was hit with a shock doping ban.",
      "The Frenchman was handed a provisional four-year suspension from football back in February 2024 after testing positive for dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), a result stemming from a sample taken the previous August. Pogba has always insisted it was a mistake and he had been given a supplement without knowing it contained a banned substance.",
      "His suspension was eventually reduced - and he was cleared to return to football in March this year. He became a free agent when his contract with Juventus was mutually terminated at the end of 2024, and he joined Ligue 1 side AS Monaco in June.",
      "Pogba has been forced to wait to return to the pitch, however, due to the need to rebuild fitness. He finally made his debut this weekend as he came on as a late substitute in Monaco's 4-1 defeat away at Rennes.",
      "Speaking on Instagram on Sunday, Pogba said: \"Last night was unforgettable. Stepping back on to the pitch after two years away meant more to me than I can express.",
      "\"To the fans, thank you for the love, the energy, and the belief. To everyone who stood behind me, supported me, and pushed me through every moment of this journey, I'm deeply grateful.",
      "\"This debut wasn't just mine... it belonged to all of you who never stopped supporting me.\"",
      "A handful of his former United teammates have showed their support in the comments of the post. Rashford was among them, leaving a simple red heart emoji.",
      "Current United captain Bruno Fernandes also echoed the sentiment - from his previous Instagram story - with the comment \"Pogback,\" while Jesse Lingard replied: \"The boy'ss back.\"",
      "Pogba came on as a late substitute in the 85th-minute, although the match was all but lost for Monaco at that stage as they trailed 4-0, with a late consolation making it 4-1 in added time. This week, however, the midfielder will hope to rack up more minutes with a crucial Champions League match against Pafos.",
      "That's followed by a trip to face French giants Paris Saint-Germain next weekend.",

      "Manchester United have welcomed the announcement of the Greater Manchester growth plan unveiled by Andy Burnham, which has promised over £1billion worth of investment.",
      "The first-of-its-kind fund will involve more than 30 projects to be backed across the region. Greater Manchester's economic growth continues to outstrip the rest of the country with an annual rate of 3.1 per cent, and the mayor of Greater Manchester, Burnham, has stated every borough should benefit.",
      "In March, United unveiled ambitious plans for a state-of-the-art 100,000-seater stadium at an event in London. Burnham had said that no public funding would be granted for the stadium itself, but conversations had been ongoing about the regeneration project surrounding the stadium.",
      "Now, an initial commitment of £26m for 382 new homes as part of the Trafford Wharf development has been promised – the first major investment in the Old Trafford regeneration area.",
      "The investment for the area around Old Trafford is part of the Greater Manchester growth plan.",
      "Collette Roche, United chief operating officer, said: “We are delighted to see the Old Trafford regeneration project at the heart of Greater Manchester’s wider growth plan for the next decade.",
      "“We want to build the world’s best football stadium as a new home for Manchester United and a venue fit for the biggest international events, including the 2035 FIFA Women’s World Cup, surrounded by a vibrant business, leisure and residential district served by excellent transport links.",
      "“We are determined to play our part, together with other stakeholders, in making this vision a reality, and unlocking the huge benefits it can deliver for the surrounding community and wider region.”",
      "Burnham has hailed the Old Trafford regeneration project as the United Kingdom's largest sports-led scheme since the London 2012 Olympics, with around 15,000 homes set to be built alongside the new 100,000-seat football stadium, as well as areas for leisure and business.",
      "The Mayoral Development Corporation was recently established for the regeneration project, and Burnham confirmed Lord Sebastian Coe has been appointed as its chair designate.",
      "Burnham has outlined his vision for Greater Manchester to become “a second city to rival any other on the planet by 2050\" and every district to benefit from “regeneration at a pace and on a scale not seen before this century”.",
      "United must reach a deal to purchase the rail yard surrounding Old Trafford before they can push ahead with stadium plans. The land is owned by Freightliner, and the parties are yet to reach an agreement.",
      "Burnham has suggested compulsory purchase powers could be used to acquire the space if a deal can not be agreed, but sources confirmed last month United were \"optimistic\" of reaching a breakthrough.",

      "In an interview with the United We Stand magazine last year, Sir Jim Ratcliffe slammed the data department at Old Trafford. “Until we are as good as anyone in the world, then it’s not good enough for Manchester United. We must have the best recruitment in the world,\" said Ratcliffe.",
      "\"Data analysis comes alongside recruitment. It doesn’t really exist here. We’re still in the last century on data analysis here. There’s an immense amount of useful data that we can get from data analysis and we’re in the 'very poor' bracket with data analysis here.",
      "\"These things don’t happen overnight. You can’t just flick a light switch and sort out recruitment. It’s all about people and we need to find the right people.”",
      "United announced the appointment of Michael Sansoni as director of data in the summer. Ratcliffe discussed the importance of bringing in the \"right people\" and landed his prime target.",
      "Sansoni was previously the senior performance engineer at the Mercedes F1 team and contributed to eight world championship-winning seasons. United confirmed that Sansoni would be tasked with establishing the club as a data-led organisation, embedding predictive and AI-driven decision-making.",
      "The University of Southampton graduate joined United two months before the official announcement of his appointment, allowing him to be involved in transfers in the summer window.",
      "In July, Sansoni said United had made \"meaningful progress\" with \"new methodologies starting to take shape and two fantastic signings, Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo\".",
      "He added: \"I’ve inherited a brilliant team: smart, committed, and hungry to make a difference and together we’re building a world-class data and AI function to power decision-making across football and the wider club. The challenge is great, but so is the opportunity. We’re only just getting started.\"",
      "United's data-led review of 2024/2025 identified the attack as the priority area for strengthening, concluding the shortage of goals was the biggest factor in the team's underperformance.",
      "Benjamin Sesko and Senne Lammens arrived in the second half of the summer transfer window. They were different signings to Cunha and Mbeumo, arriving with no Premier League experience, but the numbers were crunched on both players and United were happy to splash a combined £84.8million.",
      "The press release announcing Sesko's transfer noted that he had scored the most goals of any player under the age of 23 in Europe's top five leagues over the past two seasons.",
      "Jason Wilcox said: \"We have followed Benjamin's career closely; all of our data analysis and research concluded that he has the required qualities and personality to thrive at United.\"",
      "United sources pointed to Lammens' underlying statistics when he signed. They said the Belgium international had one of the highest goals prevented metrics in Europe, with a post-shot expected goals of +14.5, and highlighted he had made more saves than any other goalkeeper in Europe's top 10 leagues.",
      "In layman's terms, post-shot expected goals look at how many goals more or less a goalkeeper has conceded than he's been expected to, based on the quality of shots they have faced. Lammens had essentially prevented 14 goals that an 'average' goalkeeper wouldn't have been able to stop.",
      "\"You see the potential of the goalkeeper based on what they do in games; so their positioning, their decision-making and so on, and Senne was always quite high in these areas.\"",
      "Sesko has scored just two goals since his arrival from RB Leipzig, but Ruben Amorim has backed him to succeed. On the other hand, Lammens has \"surprised\" Amorim with the extent of his impact.",
      "United's business in the summer window appears to be an improvement on previous years. How much the data is responsible for that is up for debate, but the club's data department, by all accounts, has improved. Sansoni has played a key role and he is currently recruiting staff.",
      "When Sansoni's appointment was communicated, United said further recruitment is planned for a number of data, software and platform engineering roles in the coming months.",
      "Ratcliffe has been ruthless with his club-wide cuts. The employee count has been slashed significantly and every outgoing penny is now scrutinised, but the data department is not shrinking - it's growing.",
      "The United co-owner believes that investing in data can give United an edge, which will theoretically save millions of pounds in the long run. Just think how much has been wasted on transfer fees alone.",
      "United are in the process of hiring a data operations manager to join Sansoni's team to \"drive data and technology projects forward\". Sansoni has invited hopefuls who are passionate about data to get in touch.",
      "Sansoni is doing important work behind the scenes, impacting United's recruitment.",

      "Ruben Amorim has admitted that academy players who are \"maybe not good enough\" to play for Manchester United could be sold to raise funds to work within the Profit and Sustainability Rules (PSR).",
      "Nick Cox helped raise £100million from academy sales during his six-year stint as head of the youth system, but United's director of football Jason Wilcox has identified that as an area where improvement can be made.",
      "Cox joined Everton to become their technical director in September. Former Manchester City academy chief Stephen Torpey was hired from Brentford to succeed Cox, and Torpey has been tasked with increasing revenue from academy sales, while also producing players for the first team at Old Trafford.",
      "United have a proud history of giving opportunities to young players, but some believe Amorim has not given enough chances to talented youngsters from the academy system.",
      "Speaking to Stan Sports, Amorim admitted that he found it difficult to prioritise academy players when he was first appointed. He also discussed why selling academy players has become increasingly important in the era of PSR rules.",
      "\"First thing, when I arrived last year, it was really tough,\" Amorim said. \"We had so many games but no time to prepare everything, to look around, to understand the game and the kids that are here, what is the plan for them and talk with all the coaches to try to arrange the perfect space to play.",
      "\"Under-18, Under-21, who is going to play where, so we are doing that now. I'm enjoying that part. I think it's going to be, like any club in the world, but especially here in England with the fair play. The players that you can put in the first team to feel the badge, but also the players that are maybe not good enough to play for Manchester United, but can give us some money when you sell them to try to compensate for the financial fair play to buy different players.",
      "\"So I think the future of our club is going to be the academy because, like you said, if you look at the biggest years with the most success was with the academy players.\"",
      "Amorim added: \"In the current moment, we also have that part if you sell a player from our academy, all the money you can use it to buy another. So I think we need to be really focused on that.",
      "\"Our sporting director has a background with the academies and young kids, so we are doing everything to put these kids in the first team for us to be competitive in any way in the Premier League.\"",
      "United banked £40m from the sale of Alejandro Garnacho in the summer transfer window. The sale represented 'pure profit' in the books and was the highest-ever sale of a United academy graduate.",
      "United received a fixed fee of €30.5million (£25.7m) from Napoli for the sale of Scott McTominay in the summer of 2024. Amorim was asked to explain what he looks for in a young player, and he said: \"It's an honour to play for Manchester United. Sometimes, some kids take that for granted. That is the first thing.",
      "\"Then you have to look, to play in the Premier League nowadays, the physicality is something you cannot run from. You need to pay attention to that. Then you need to help the kids to cope with the media attention. That is something that we need to work and be really careful when one kid makes one game, not to make a big deal of that.",
      "\"And we had some issues in the past when we did that, and we got that wrong. And then the most important thing is talent and working hard. That is the things we are looking for from our players.\"",

      "Ruben Amorim believes the mindset of his Manchester United players needs to change when they hold the lead in games. The Reds were leading 1-0 at Tottenham before the international break but had to settle for a point after a disappointing second half display.",
      "The same thing happened at Nottingham Forest a week earlier, where United struggled in the second half after dominating the first. In the victory over Brighton, the Reds were almost punished when they were pegged back to 3-2 having been cruising earlier in the contest.",
      "In an interview with the Premier League, Amorim was asked why there has been such drop-offs from his team of late. He replied: \"I think we lose intensity. I think we have some problems in two games that we lost, we lose Casemiro with some pain, Harry Maguire the same thing, and they are key players not just the way they play and the experience they have, the set pieces and people don’t take that into consideration.",
      "\"I think when we are in advantage, we lose that thing of wanting to continue to press in the same way. We had that against Brighton until we suffered the first goal. So it’s a lot of things together. We think about 'let’s not suffer a goal' and our mindset should be 'we have one goal, we must get another and have the opportunity to kill the game'. So it is mental but it is also physical, we need to improve in that aspect also.\"",
      "Amorim's thoughts are shared by his United players. Speaking after the Spurs draw, Matthijs de Ligt explained how fatigue played a role in the result. He said: \"Luckily we got a point, I think we deserved more the way we played, I felt the second half we were a little tired. We didn't get the chance to get out of our half.\"",

      "Patrick Dorgu claimed Manchester United \"have enough good players\" when asked whether he would like to share a dressing room with Scott McTominay at Old Trafford after his wonderful goal against Denmark. The former United midfielder was sold in 2024 to Napoli - five months prior to Dorgu's United arrival - and since then he has been impressing in Serie A.",
      "This week the midfielder helped Scotland beat Dorgu's Denmark 4-2 at Hampden Park to secure the home nation's qualification to the World Cup in USA, Mexico and Canada. McTominay opened the scoring after less than five minutes with a tremendous overhead kick.",
      "United loanee Rasmus Hojlund scored from the penalty spot to level the game before Lawrence Shankland guided in a corner to give the Scots the advantage. Denmark only needed a point to qualify automatically and Dorgu's late strike looked to have earned them just that but two late goals saw them settle for a place in the play-offs.",
      "When asked post-match if he would like to be playing alongside McTominay at United, Dorgu said: \"It was a good goal but we also have enough good players at United as well. I am happy for him winning the league in Napoli.\"",
      "The next international break is not until March at which point Denmark will need to beat North Macedonia and then either Czechia or the Republic of Ireland to progress to the World Cup. Dorgu insists his focus is now on succeeding with the Reds until then.",
      "He said: \"100% we just need to look forward. We are in a really good position at United.",
      "\"We will go back with confidence to help the team to get more wins. Denmark is now March. It is a long time and we just need to concentrate on club matters until then.\"",
      "Dorgu is expected to be back in the United squad on Monday night when they host Everton in the Premier League. A win for the Reds could move them into the top four.",

      "Senne Lammens wore a polo shirt and a navy sweatshirt when he visited Old Trafford after signing for Manchester United. The young goalkeeper looked as though he could be joining United to work in their HR department.",
      "The same observation was made when Lammens reported for international duty with Belgium last week - the 23-year-old was dressed in a beige collared jacket, a khaki t-shirt and chinos.",
      "\"By accident, I saw an article saying he was wearing something boring when he reported for international duty and fans saying they hoped he stays like this,\" laughed Hayk Milkon, one of Lammens' former coaches.",
      "\"This 'boringness' is just the way Senne is, he's really calm and no excesses. He focuses on what he needs to focus on and is open with the people around him. He keeps his feet on the ground.\"",
      "If Lammens looks like someone who could work in an office, every workplace would love to have him in their five-a-side team. United believe they have signed a young goalkeeper with huge potential, and fans who were present at Old Trafford against Sunderland left the stadium buzzing about his debut.",
      "The quirk is that Lammens appears to be a different person when he wears his goalkeeper kit. He made a supremely confident United debut, aggressively commanded his area and kept a clean sheet.",
      "Milkon coached Lammens during their time together at Club Brugge. Milkon is now the youngest manager in the Belgian top-flight and Lammens plays for the biggest club in England.",
      "\"It was Senne with his headphones on. He would go into the gym to do his recovery or some extra top-ups. Or he would just go to relax by playing basketball - he loved to play basketball.\"",
      "Milkon coached in different roles at Club Brugge. He was the assistant of Club NXT (their reserve team), served as their interim manager, was in charge of the Under-18s and eventually became a first-team coach.",
      "His time at Club Brugge coincided with Lammens progressing from the academy to their first team, so he is uniquely positioned to provide insight into United's new goalkeeper signing.",
      "Lammens joined Club Brugge's academy when he was 12. \"He was a guy with huge potential,\" said Milkon. \"As I learned from colleagues who had worked with him when he was much younger, I heard there was a moment that clicked in his head when he became super professional.",
      "\"He was one of the guys during Covid - when the players were not able to train - who was doing a lot at home, he was really going far with this to be the best in these types of areas.",
      "\"Then he continued like this when he joined the first team to train with them. He always wanted to improve. We also had something in place to look at the parameters on which goalkeepers are judged.",
      "\"You see the potential of the goalkeeper based on what they do in games; so their positioning, their decision-making and so on, and Senne was always quite high in these areas.",
      "\"The only bad luck that he had was that the first-team goalkeeper was Simon Mignolet. He's an amazing goalkeeper, so it was difficult for Senne to stay over there in the role of No.2.",
      "\"That would have also blocked his growth, so it was good for him in the end to make the step to go to Antwerp and he did a tremendous job there. It was amazing to see how fast he adapted.\"",
      "Milkon continued: \"I think for us at Club Brugge, it was very clear to everyone that Senne was a top goalkeeper. He would have been the perfect fit for Club Brugge to be the No.1.",
      "\"That was not possible because Mignolet was there. But the parameters that we used to judge his performances indicated he was ticking so many boxes already, and he was consistently doing it.",
      "\"There weren't ups and downs with his performances. He was consistently really high and when you compare this to the top goalkeepers, you have a benchmark to say 'Ok, what potential does this guy have?'",
      "\"He had some chances with the first team at Club Brugge and made a mistake, or maybe two, but in the end it was very clear to everyone that he was a top goalkeeper.",
      "\"It was impossible to try to extend his contract because, again, you have Mignolet, and you cannot block a guy like this. You know he has to go out, he has to play, and he will improve even more.\"",
      "When asked about Lammens' strengths, he said: \"I would say that his decision-making was very good. He is very calm, he sees the solutions on the pitch, he has a quick reaction time and understands the balance between risk and reward, and which decisions are the right ones to make.",
      "\"His clean passing is great, his footwork was really good, and he's just an amazing goalkeeper with the shot-stopping. He made some incredible saves back then already. He's quite a complete goalkeeper.",
      "\"But making the right decisions at a very young age, being very mature with this, was really impressive. And the fact that he is good with both feet is another big strength.",
      "\"For me, Senne is a very calm guy and has all the qualities to be a top professional. That was my impression when I first met him when he was younger and he never changed.\"",
      "Lammens joined Royal Antwerp on a free transfer in the summer of 2023. He was handed his debut a few months later and served as an understudy that season, but earned first-choice status for 2024/2025.",
      "His performances drew attention from the Belgian media. Lammens saved four penalties across a successful first full campaign and received a call-up to Belgium's senior squad in March.",
      "Milkon said: \"I was not surprised when I saw Manchester United had come calling. And to record his first clean sheet, I was really happy for him. Senne is a potential No.1 for the Red Devils - the Belgium national team.",
      "\"He got his chance, he took it, and we're all really proud of him, but we knew it would happen. I believe he has all the capabilities to become the best in the world, so I wish him all the best. I'm sure he will have a very good career in England, and Manchester United should return to the big club they used to be.",
      "\"He will have a positive impact on that, for sure, and hopefully he will be Belgium's first-choice goalkeeper soon. I believe he has the potential, the skillset and the personality to do that.",
      "\"For me, it was just having a tiny little part in having an influence on him at Brugge, but it was the most positive memories of our relationship that we had during this spell.",
      "\"I'm very proud that he is reaching these high levels and not surprised. I believe he will be successful because he is a guy who will not change his focus or start to do something different. He is calm, that's his personality and character, and he wants to succeed. He is hungry and will keep working to be his best.",
      "\"He is so calm, and you have to be patient in football. You cannot worry too much and want things too early, but finding the balance between not being impatient and, at the same time, pushing and demanding what you deserve in a good way, means everything will sort itself out.\"",
      "United staff who have worked with Lammens at Carrington have echoed Milkon's sentiments. He has been described as \"really mature for his age\" and is said to have taken the move in his stride.",

      "Manchester United head coach Ruben Amorim has admitted that one of his players is “struggling”, while he has opened the door to two transfers.",
      "The Red Devils have picked up under Amorim in recent months as they have entered the race to qualify for the Champions League.",
      "Man Utd‘s summer signings have made a positive impact, while Amorim has made slight tactical tweaks to improve his side’s results and performances.",
      "The Premier League giants are currently five games unbeaten in the Premier League and will go level on points with fourth-placed Aston Villa if they beat Everton on Monday night.",
      "As mentioned, Man Utd’s summer signings have performed well this season, while Amorim has also gotten more out of other players who have recently struggled. However, Manuel Ugarte has been their weak link and the head coach has admitted that he is “struggling”.",
      "“No, I understand,” Amorim told reporters when asked whether he had been surprised by Ugarte’s form this season.",
      "READ: Man Utd vs Everton predictions: Fascinating first-half trend to continue at Old Trafford",
      "“If, again.. you are here [Manchester] longer than me, and you can sense that a lot of very good players come here, and sometimes they struggle.",
      "“And they are struggling, he is struggling in the moment. But it is our job to try to help our players, and again, everything can change. And you saw it five weeks ago, the environment was completely different.",
      "“So I know that Ugarte is struggling in the moment and my job is trying to help him to feel as a player, like I felt when he was a Sporting player, for example. But it is a different world and he needs to adapt and he needs to improve, especially in training.”",
      "Man Utd could enter the market to make a signing or two in January, while exits could also be on the cards.",
      "Kobbie Mainoo and Joshua Zirkzee have only been bit-part players for Man Utd this season and it has been suggested that they could leave in January to boost their chances of playing at the World Cup.",
      "Now, Amorim has refused to rule out the two players leaving in the winter, though he has pointed out that the “club comes first”.",
      "“The first thing is that the club comes first, so we have to think about the club and the team, and then everything can happen,” Amorim added.",
      "“I was a football player, I understand everything. And I want to help my players in every situation, so I don’t know what is going to happen. I want my players happy, I understand the frustration of some players, seeing that the World Cup is there.",
      "“And I know what it means for the World Cup, but Manchester United comes first, so if I can help the club and the players, I will be happy, if not I have to think about the team.”",
      "Amorim also commented on whether signing a new midfielder is going to be a priority for Man Utd in January. He said: “It is hard to say that but I think we can add in the future.",
      "“I don’t know when, different characteristics, the same thing that our thinking in front, sometimes it is not the quality of the players, it is the characteristics of the players and we can improve in some areas in our club.",
      "“But I am happy with the guys that we have in the moment and I think they have so much more to give. So it is my job to think about them, not the other guys that are not here.”",
      "Man Utd boss Ruben Amorim has confirmed that Benjamin Sesko’s injury is “not that serious” ahead of a busy December schedule.",

      "Man Utd boss Ruben Amorim has hit back at critics of his formation after the Red Devils starting picking up results in recent weeks.",
      "Manchester United have a problem player, but his mooted ‘surprise’ January replacement has the joint-worst record in Europe’s top five leagues this season.",
      "According to reports, Manchester United have already ‘decided’ who is at the ‘top of the list’ as they look to sign a new midfielder in 2026."

      "Liverpool, are you f***ing this up?",
      "We really think they might be f***ing this up. Having cantered to the Premier League in bizarrely unchallenged fashion last season, they seemed all set to make a right go of defending their title after signing everyone they could get their hands on (although maybe some defenders would have been an idea) and then winning all of their first five games.",
      "Since then, though, it’s played six, lost six in the Premier League as a five-point lead at the top of the table has become an 11-point deficit. Arsenal have zoomed beyond them, but so too have a truly hilarious and motley collection of other clubs that encompass all the Premier League has to offer.",
      "The mini-crisis is now absolutely massive, and even if Liverpool do sort themselves out in due course – as surely they must – their title chances already look lost.",
      "Long way to go, of course, but it inevitably sets the mind a-thinking about a) other rubbish Premier League title defences and thus b) whether or not there are enough of them for us to scrape together a vaguely justifiable 10.",
      "Fair warning, the answer to b) is probably ‘No, there is not’ even with last year’s City shenanigans to help us on our way. The top half of this list has some undeniable doozies, but we’ve had to be slightly dickish about teams who finished second before we get to that good stuff. Sorry about that. Sure you understand.",
      "",
      "Is it fair to include this purely because they didn’t manage to go unbeaten for a second successive season? Yes, it is.",
      "You can’t go around calling yourselves The Invincibles and then lose five league games the following year, can you? Not really.",
      "All seemed to be going swimmingly enough in the early stages, with Arsenal winning eight of their first nine games to extend that unbeaten run to 49 league games across three seasons, but the defeat when it came threw them all off-kilter.",
      "It was an absurd and controversial defeat, at Old Trafford of all places, and it left a mark. Arsenal won only one of their next five games, and that a 5-4 absurdity in the North London Derby.",
      "They recovered their composure from there on but the aura of invincibility was lost as they trailed in 12 points behind Jose Mourinho’s Chelsea. Looking back now, you can almost see the Premier League’s tectonic plates shifting; Arsenal haven’t won the league since.",
      "",
      "Manchester United’s 2003/04 might have featured an eight-point drop-off but it couldn’t match the sheer shock value of 2001/02 at the time.",
      "United may have only finished three points worse off than their title-winning season in 2000/01, but it dropped them to a previously unthinkable third place. Third! Never before in the Premier League era had United suffered such indignity, and to do it the season after Ferguson had rowed back on his first retirement decision as well.",
      "Not only that, but United managed to make a pig’s ear of everything that season, going potless for the first time in four campaigns. They went out of the League Cup early to Arsenal, didn’t get past the fourth round of the FA Cup and even the saving grace of a run to the Champions League semi-finals ended in the painful ‘what if?’ of away-goals defeat to Bayer Leverkusen.",
      "United’s league season fell apart in an autumn run of five defeats in seven games, three of them in a row against Arsenal, Chelsea and West Ham. They only lost three more games after that, but the damage was done.",
      "One of those three defeats was the crowning turd in the bowl, though, as Arsenal sealed the title with a 1-0 win at Old Trafford.",
      "",
      "Antonio Conte took the Premier League by storm in 2016/17, marching to the title in his maiden season in charge while making a back-three fashionable again. The Blues earned 93 points, seven clear of Tottenham and 15 more than any team that posed a theoretical threat of actually winning the thing.",
      "The novelty of the back-three soon wore off the following season, though, with Chelsea’s opponents having sussed them out, all the while Conte’s players themselves seemed bored by it all as his squad suffered from the desperately short attention span that is customary at Stamford Bridge. Conte spent much of the season in a funk after not getting his way in the transfer market, which is out of character, isn’t it?",
      "At least the FA Cup sprinkled some glitter on a turd of a season, while Chelsea could also console themselves that it was way less bad than their previous title defence. Chelsea’s run of first, tenth, first, fifth between 2014/15 and 2017/18 really should be studied in great detail and punishing length.",
      "",
      "Something astonishingly quaint now about the very idea of a local businessman rocking up with a few million quid and buying the Premier League title.",
      "Kenny Dalglish dragged Rovers over the finish line in 1995, one point ahead of Man Utd, despite losing three of their last five matches. It was a success built by Dalglish, funded by Jack Walker’s millions, with Alan Shearer and Chris Sutton’s goals doing most of the heavy lifting. Rovers led from the front, relinquishing top spot for only a couple of games from the start of November, even if they did their best to hand the title to United during the run-in.",
      "But they could not sustain it. Rovers, reeling from the resignation of Dalglish as manager, finished a distant seventh the following season while winning just one of their Champions League fixtures in a European campaign that is best remembered for David Batty and Graeme Le Saux coming to blows in Moscow. Kicked off the season by losing the Charity Shield to Everton in a game we just had to look up, it having been completely erased from memory, and were also bundled out of the FA Cup in the third round.",
      "So yeah, not great all round, really.",
      "",
      "Jurgen Klopp’s Reds finally ended their 30-year title drought in stunning fashion, overcoming a pandemic and 103-day period between their 29th and 30th matches to gather a club-record 99 points, sealing their 19th championship with seven games to spare – beating the previous best by two matches.",
      "While there are mischief-makers who like to pretend this season comes with an asterisk, we should all really be grateful that the absurd armies of Premier League football fans who see conspiracy and subterfuge everywhere have so little to go at in that interrupted season. Liverpool had it nailed down long before the pandemic shut the country down.",
      "Not the biggest thing about the pandemic, sure, but imagine the nonsense we’d all have had to put up with had it happened during one of the daft title races where Liverpool narrowly missed out to City.",
      "But they couldn’t maintain their stunning form after ending that title drought. The Reds were breaking all the wrong records the following season, with a 1-0 loss to Fulham being their sixth consecutive home defeat – their worst run ever. But Klopp’s beleaguered side rediscovered some grit, if not necessarily their best form, to win eight of their last 10 matches and sneak a Champions League place while all around them floundered.",
      "Mitigation abounded in the form of injuries to key players and the perhaps inevitable release and relief of finally scratching that 30-year itch. Getting close to that 99-point tally again was always asking a lot, but 70 shouldn’t have been unreasonable.",
      "",
      "Seems harsh to put this so high and close to the genuinely catastrophic attempts at defending a Premier League title.",
      "But we’re also in victims-of-own-success territory here, and while it may seem harsh to judge City differently it’s also unavoidable. Guardiola’s consistency means he is alongside Fergie as the only Premier League manager who doesn’t get the mitigation that everyone else gets; that defending a Premier League title is really bloody hard.",
      "If you go around making that really difficult task look as straightforward as those two did, then it’s going to be so much more jarring when it does all go to sh*t for a season.",
      "Even now, only a year on, it’s easy to forget just how vast and unshakeable the aura around Pep’s City was. The absolute certainty everyone felt that no matter how awkward a position they might get into during the first half of the season, they would simply steamroller everyone in the second half.",
      "That’s what an unprecedented four straight English league titles does to everyone else. Especially when it’s Arsenal who have been noisily coming second in the last couple of them and insisting it is literally impossible to do any more.",
      "Yet slowly at first and then very fast indeed, it became apparent during the autumn of 2024 that City were not going to save themselves this time.",
      "In a two-month spell from October 30 to December 29, City played 13 games across three competitions and somehow won only one of them.",
      "And it all began after a run of five straight wins, that came to an abrupt end with a 2-1 Carabao defeat at Spurs (genuinely, what is it with City and f*cking Spurs? It makes no sense). A Premier League defeat at Bournemouth was followed by a Champions League humbling at the hands of Ruben Amorim on his Sporting farewell tour, before another 2-1 defeat at Brighton and then a 4-0 thrashing at the hands of, yes, f*cking Spurs (How? Why?).",
      "Perhaps the lowest point of the run came in the Champions League when failing to see out a home game against Feyenoord despite leading 3-0 with barely a quarter of an hour remaining.",
      "But it’s title defences we’re really interested in, so while the wider context of the overall run that scuppered them in three competitions is fun, we should try and stay focused. That league run at its worst point was one win, two draws and six defeats in nine games that took City from top of the table and two points clear of Liverpool to seventh and trailing by 12.",
      "Recovering to limp home third because everyone else was sh*te doesn’t really make it okay.",
      "",
      "United recovered from losing the 2011/12 title race to AGUERRRROOOOO to bounce back and secure their 20th championship in Ferguson’s final season in charge at Old Trafford. The signing of Robin van Persie was the catalyst, with the former Arsenal striker scoring 26 Premier League goals as United eased home by 11 points in a far cry from the final-day goal-difference antics of the previous season.",
      "Then Ferguson left, urging United supporters to ‘back your new manager’. A few months later, a plane was flying over Old Trafford proclaiming ‘Wrong One – Moyes out’. By the time Moyes was finally, inevitably sacked in April, with four games remaining, United were already guaranteed to record their lowest points tally in the Premier League era, with home games a particular problem.",
      "Under Moyes, United were beaten six times at Old Trafford, losing in the FA Cup to Swansea, while Sunderland dumped them out of the League Cup. It led to United missing out on Champions league football for the first time since 1995 as they finished a lowly seventh and 25 points worse off.",
      "The absence of Ferguson/presence of Moyes is quite understandably cited as the main reason, but United absolutely butchered the transfer window as they discovered for the first but not last time that Ferguson really had been making their life unbelievably easy by winning what he did with what he had.",
      "Ed Woodward’s failure to bring the desired and requested Gareth Bale, Toni Kroos and Cesc Fabregas certainly didn’t help matters. Although he did, in his first season in big boy pants, manage to overpay for Marouane Fellaini in the final hours of the summer window.",
      "And then Moyes railed against the fixture schedule after the champions were made to play Chelsea, Liverpool and Man City in their first five matches: ‘I find it hard to believe that’s the way the balls came out of the bag, that’s for sure,’ he tinfoiled, having apparently confused the fixture computer for the FA Cup third-round draw.",
      "",
      "Jose Mourinho first disproved the theory that you should never go back by winning a third Premier League title in the second season of his second reign at Stamford Bridge. New arrivals Diego Costa and Cesc Fabregas immediately flourished, with Eden Hazard providing the inspiration in a 2014/15 season which saw him crowned PFA Player of the Year.",
      "Mourinho then set about reproving the theory by setting the ultimate benchmark for his now infamous Third-Season Destroy And Exits. The tone for a pathetic title defence was set on the opening weekend, when Mourinho took aim at Chelsea’s medical staff for doing their jobs. The fall-out hung over Stamford Bridge long after Mourinho was fired in mid-December, at which point the Blues had lost nine of their 16 league matches to leave them languishing a point above the relegation zone.",
      "Guus Hiddink, as he tends to, steadied the ship and a top-half finish following the club’s worst start to a season in 37 years became a creditable achievement for Roman Abramovich’s favourite firefighter. But a 37-point drop-off from one season to the next is really very bad indeed no matter how you slice it.",
      "Obviously, they then won the league the following season because the Premier League was, although we didn’t yet know it, undergoing a few years of utter and glorious weirdness before Pep Guardiola would come along and tame it thoroughly.",
      "The mounting evidence that such chaos appears to be returning to the Barclays is something we should all welcome.",
      "",
      "Claudio Ranieri’s Foxes stunned everyone by going from great escapees under Nigel Pearson in 2014/15 to 5000-1 Premier League kings the following year. In the end, it was a procession, with a 10-point margin of victory. The greatest story ever told in English football? Probably.",
      "The Foxes, understandably, suffered quite the hangover from Jamie Vardy’s party and a summer basking in their stunning achievement. N’Golo Kante’s exit hardly helped. They reached the Champions League quarter-finals, but by that time, Ranieri had paid for a miserable title defence with his job. The Italian was axed after just five wins in 25 league games, with his champions one point above the drop zone.",
      "Craig Shakespeare inspired some improvement and Leicester won seven of their last 13 to finish in 12th.",
      "",
      "To our immense relief, this one sneaks in on a bit of a technicality. It might not be a Premier League title defence, but it was a title defence in the Premier League era and we’re cheerfully loopholing off into the sunset with our fingers in our ears. We can’t hear you.",
      "One of the reasons we want this in is just purely and simply that it means one less Actually Kind Of Okay Defence at the other end of this list. The main one, though, is that it was a really bad defence.",
      "Howard Wilkinson’s Whites, inspired by the February arrival of Eric Cantona, broke Manchester United’s hearts down the final stretch of the last Division One season by unseating the Red Devils, who had led from the front through most of the season. Some Leeds fans will argue that their four-point triumph was a bigger miracle than Leicester’s, with Wilko taking United from 10th in Division Two to English champions within three years.",
      "Leeds’ slide as champions was certainly even more dramatic than Leicester’s. During the Premier League’s inaugural season, Wilko’s champs failed to win a game away from Elland Road. They finished 17th in a 22-team division, only two points above relegated Crystal Palace and 31 down on their title-winning effort the year before football was invented. The European Cup offered little respite. They survived the first round after Stuttgart fielded one foreign player too many, only to be beaten home and away by Rangers in the next.",
      "Gary Neville singled out two Liverpool players who are “struggling” and should be dropped as Arne Slot is urged to “change the style or the system”.",
      "Liverpool are bad enough for us to pretend Arne Slot might be about to get sacked and, thus, replaced.",
      "Arsenal have lost a left-back but added two creative players to the Premier League XI of the season so far.",
      "Transfer expert Fabrizio Romano has revealed the “situation” at Liverpool following their disappointing 3-0 loss to Nottingham Forest at Anfield.",
      "Daniel Farke is the manager under the harshest international-break spotlight which leads us to inevitably ponder who might be next in the Leeds hotseat.",
      "There are growing calls for Arne Slot to be sacked by Liverpool, but his should not be the last head to roll."

      "Caught Offside write that Dortmund are keen to give Sancho a third spell at the club, but not so keen that they are willing to pay the winger anything like the kind of money he is said to be on at Old Trafford.",

      "The Bundesliga side are also said to be unwilling to make an exception and break their wage structure to re-secure Sancho’s signature. That would leave Sancho either needing to take a biiiig old 50% pay cut.",

      "There’s also the fact that, let’s face it, Sancho’s stock is considerably lower now than it was  when he signed that lucrative contract at United, so he may well not get a better offer than whatever Dortmund put on the table.",

      "Premier League clubs received a total of £2.83billion last season, which was comprised of six payments through the division’s ‘central revenue system’, something the Premier League says ‘ensures the most equitable distribution of funds of any major European league’.",
      "Liverpool were paid £174.9m as champions – short of Manchester City’s record £176.2m in 2022/23 – while Newcastle received just over £160m to chuck into their PSR black hole.",
      "Southampton were handed £109.2m for their efforts in finishing a distant bottom. It pays to be in the Premier League.",
      "Some of those payments are fixed. All 20 clubs automatically receive around £96.9m through an equal share distributed based on both the domestic (£29.8m in 2024/25) and international (£59.2m in 2024/25) broadcast deals – those TV rights are lucrative for a reason – as well as £7.9m each from central commercial revenue streams.",

      "For the 2024/25 season, the difference in prize money was around £2.7m per position. Southampton were given as much for finishing bottom, all the way up to champions Liverpool receiving £53.1m. It basically helped pay for 97.4% of Giorgi Mamardashvili and Jeremie Frimpong.",
      "That can be expected to fluctuate with inflation and other factors – it was around £2.8m per position in 2023/24 – but it offers a rough guide as to what clubs should expect to earn this season.",

Arsenal had 29 matches and were paid £24.2m, while Manchester United (28 games for £23.4m), Aston Villa (27 games for £22.6m) and Chelsea (26 games for £21.8m) were televised frequently and rewarded handsomely.",
      "Ipswich were shown on the fewest occasions and received £8.9m in facility fees for their 10 live televised UK fixtures.",
      "This can lead to discrepancies in terms of those variable payments. Manchester United’s prize money after finishing 15th last season was £136.2m, more than the four clubs immediately above them – West Ham (£130.9m in 14th), Everton (£131.8m in 13th), Crystal Palace (£136.1m in 12th) and Fulham (£135.5m in 11th) – as Ruben Amorim’s side were picked for far more live TV games.",

      "The Premier League clubs have voted in favour of squad cost ratio (SCR) replacing profit and sustainability rules (PSR) as the new system of financial fair play and the latest financial results reveal the three clubs which would be facing sanctions had it already been in place.",
      "The new rules will limit the amount of revenue a club can spend on player and manager wages, transfers and agents’ fees to 85%. Bournemouth, Brentford, Brighton, Crystal Palace, Fulham and Leeds voted against the change, but the minimum of 14 clubs was reached.",
      "Both Chelsea and Aston Villa were handed heavy fines by UEFA for the 2024/2025 campaign for breaching their SCR limit, which was at that stage 80% and is now set at just 70%. That far stricter level means a club competing in Europe next season could be sanctioned by UEFA but be compliant in the Premier League.",
      "Any team above the 85% mark in the Premier League – the Green Threshold –will face a fine, though they’ve provided significant wiggle room to avoid sporting sanctions, with a multi-year rolling allowance of 30% permitting clubs to spend beyond the limit.",
      "The Red Threshold is 85% plus the allowance; any club beyond that threshold will be given a six-point deduction plus another point for every £6.5m over that mark.",
      "It means that any Premier League club can have a squad cost at 115% of their revenue and avoid a points deduction, though those percentages will change for 2027/2028 and the seasons after that if some of the allowance has already been used.",
      "If, for example, a club spends 95% on their squad next season, they’ve used 10% of their allowance and can therefore spend 105% on their squad the season after, using the remaining 20% of their allowance, without sporting sanction. Got it? Great.",

      "Whether by fans, managers, sporting directors, pundits, us journos or even themselves, these are the most overrated players at each Premier League club.",
      "",
      "Arsenal: William Saliba\nWe may be about to see just how good Saliba really is as superior centre-back partner Gabriel faces up to a couple of months on the sidelines, but also probably not because Christhian Mosquera or Piero Hincapie will be the perfectly capable replacements now charged with making the champion coat-tail rider look a whole lot better than he actually is.",
      "And if it’s not them successfully helping Saliba pull the wool over our eyes then it could be one of the dozen or so full-back-cum-centre-backs Mikel Arteta has to choose from. Facetiousness aside, Arsenal really should take £100m from Real Madrid. Any drop-off without Saliba, if indeed there was one, would be negligible.",
      "",
      "Aston Villa: Ollie Watkins\nAlways be wary of a striker praised for “stretching defences” as the subtext is almost always that they’re a bit sh*t at putting the ball in the back of the net. Watkins is very, very good at stretching defences.",
      "",
      "Bournemouth: Justin Kluivert\nWe can’t quite believe he didn’t join Tottenham before experiencing what would be seen as a dip in form from the high of last season, but on the basis of his six previous seasons of senior football, is much more likely the mediocre standard we can continue to expect from Kluivert.",
      "",
      "Brentford: Jordan Henderson\nWe concede that Henderson has been better than we expected (and hoped) on his return to the Premier League. But perhaps clouded by our great lily-livered lefty dislike of a man who moved to Saudi Arabia having been such a supposedly staunch supporter of the LGBTQ+ community, we don’t hold pointing, shouting and playing a couple of long balls in quite such high regard as those who worship at the altar of the midfielder with an entirely broken moral compass.",
      "",
      "Brighton: Carlos Baleba\nJust imagine the fun we would currently be having if Baleba was putting in these almost comically poor performances compared to last season for a Manchester United side that had panicked into his £100m transfer.",
      "The downturn could be down to his head being turned, but if he turned it a little more often he may not get caught in possession quite as much, amirite? Crikey Moses he’s no Moises [Caicedo].",

      "Burnley: Marcus Edwards\nAt one stage linked fairly heavily with a return to Tottenham or to Manchester United in one of the clearest examples of football clubs confusing ‘looking at who happens to be playing quite a lot for Sporting’ with actual scouting. Edwards has made three substitute appearances totalling 21 minutes this season.",
      "",
      "Chelsea: Liam Delap\nAdmittedly a very small sample size thanks to the injury and absurd red card, but on a scale from useless lump to world-class striker he’s currently closer to Chris Sutton than Didier Drogba.",

But two of those assists came against Wolves, and should thus be stricken from the record, and he hasn’t managed another in his seven games since, scoring just one goal.",
      "In the cold light of day, having put down our ‘We heart Jack’ placards, we’ve come to accept that England are probably better off with a bit of speed on the left wing and our ‘top lads’ agenda may be clouding our view with regard to him playing in a No.10 position he’s taken up roughly thrice in the last five seasons.",
      "",
      "Fulham: Emile Smith Rowe\nWe can’t quite work out if he’s suffered or benefited from that 18 months or so when he was paired with Bukayo Saka as the future of Arsenal. The reputation built partly through that briefly inextricable link will have played a role in his move to Fulham, but also means we may always have expected too much.",
      "While one Hale End pin-up is now widely regarded as one of the best footballers on the planet, the other tends to watch Harry Wilson play football from the bench.",
      "",
      "Leeds: Dominic Calvert-Lewin\n58 goals in 248 Premier League games raises one big question: How has a striker who’s only scored 58 goals in 248 Premier League games played 248 Premier League games? Take out a two-season glut and he’s scored 25 goals in 163.",
      "",
      "Liverpool: Florian Wirtz\nWe’re currently at the anger stage in the Premier League flop process, barraged by Wirtz advocates, mainly hailing from his homeland, insisting Gary Neville and his other critics will soon be eating their words.",
      "If it’s anything like the stages of grief, and we suspect it is as Bundesliga voices have already had great difficulty accepting the reality of the loss of Wirtz in that initial period of denial, we can expect Alexander Isak and others to be put forward as bigger flops in a bargaining bid, before depression and finally acceptance that a) Wirtz was hugely overrated, and b) the Premier League is indeed, without question, The Best League In The World.",
      "",
      "Manchester City: Tijjani Reijnders\nIt turns out a game against Wolves on the opening day of the season, after which Reijnders was hailed as Manchester City’s answer to Kevin De Bruyne, Ilkay Gundogan and David Silva in one neat little 82kg bundle, isn’t quite the harbinger of success many thought it was.",
      "",
      "Manchester United: Senne Lammens\nWe very much enjoyed the tongue-in-cheek “are you Schmeichel in disguise?” chants from Manchester United fans as Lammens claimed simple crosses that his recent predecessors often contrived to make a mess of on his debut against Sunderland.",
      "But those tongues are now conspicuously absent from cheeks as genuine claims are being made about the 23-year-old being the undisputed answer to the Red Devils’ goalkeeping woes after literally five games of simple competency.",

      "",
      "Tottenham: Rodrigo Bentancur\nNever has a footballer been more highly regarded on the basis of having some poise in possession. Bentancur is frequently seen as a key cog in the Tottenham midfield, and we wholeheartedly agree, but only because the other members of said midfield have as much poise as someone three sheets to the wind attempting to fumble their key into a lock.",
      "",
      "West Ham: Lucas Paqueta\nWe are very intrigued by what might happen if Paqueta extricates himself from West Ham in 2026, as is suggested will be the case, because for every game in which he does something entirely out of keeping with the quality of the football club he currently plays for, there are half a dozen more where he looks as though he might have found his level.",

      "Wayne Rooney doesn’t immediately strike as the tinfoil hat-type, but it feels like the mere mention of QPR might at any point lead him off on a tangent which eventually ends in vehemence about how jet fuel doesn’t melt Taye Taiwo and Clint Hill.",
      "The Manchester United legend has a niche and it is carved out in cast-iron nonsense. And Mike Dean poured petrol on that particular dumpster fire earlier this week.",
      "“What was strange about it,” the former referee said on The Overlap, “is that once QPR found out they were safe, the game restarted and I think Jamie Mackie’s on the pitch, he’s going like that and celebrating while the game’s going on because they know they’re safe. They [Manchester City] make it 2-2 and they [QPR] just kick it back and give it to them.”",
      "And that much is true. Shaun Derry, who wore the captain’s armband for the final 40 minutes at the Etihad after a bout of generational headloss from Joey Barton, once said as such years later:",
      "“We kicked off and immediately knocked the ball into the far corner, as you would in rugby, trying to play for territory. Joe Hart came out and took a throw-in. I thought, ‘Why have we done that?’. It could have come back into me or into whoever in midfield and then back to defenders and into Paddy Kenny, and then you’ve taken 30 seconds off the clock.”",
      "But as chief kick-off culprit Jay Bothroyd added in the same Athletic article: “When I came on the pitch, Mark Bowen, Mark Hughes’ assistant, just said to me to try to hold it up, try and help us get up the pitch, and then once they scored, he was saying to me just kick the ball into the corner. Literally, kick the ball into the corner, get behind, get back to the halfway line and stay compact again.”",
      "If it was a grand scheme devised to undermine Manchester United then of course former Shimizu S-Pulse midfielder and Wales international Bowen was the mastermind.",
      "The reality was that a team facing the prospect of relegation for roughly 94 of the 95 minutes played, not far off half of which they had to play away from home against the best team in the league with 10 men because of Barton’s implosion, was simply exhausted.",
      "As with any decent conspiracy theory, there are salient points among the ruins of absurdity: the kick-off thing was weird; Djibril Cisse did celebrate with Samir Nasri – an old friend from their time together at Marseille – at the final whistle; and there were a handful of Manchester City alumni in the QPR side.",
      "Three, to be exact. The precise same number of former Manchester United players in the Sunderland team which dozed to a 1-0 defeat at the Stadium of Light 140 miles away, failing to muster a single shot from the 65th minute onwards.",
      "And Sir Alex Ferguson had an inside agent working for him in the QPR ranks. When Anton Ferdinand feels the need to reiterate four times in one sentence how he “was p*ssed off” at having cost his brother a Premier League title eight years after the fact, the idea that Manchester City benefited from a light dose of match-fixing starts to collapse in on itself.",
      "Rooney, a five-time Premier League champion, really ought to move on from the inability to make it a half-dozen. Not least because Manchester United lost the title on goal difference to a team which beat them 7-1 on aggregate that season, instigating one of the biggest yet most under-the-radar bottlings in history.",
      "But mainly because Rooney has unforgivably forced us into The Worst Person You Know Just Made a Great Point territory with his incessant cry-arsing about actual Manchester United being screwed by a team rolling over for one of their rivals.",
      "“To say that me, or Djibril Cisse, or Shaun Wright-Phillips, or Nedum Onuoha, or Paddy Kenny have somehow concocted to make sure you don’t win the league is b*llocks,” Barton said in October. With Rooney seemingly dangerously close to labelling each of the above lizard people Illuminati members who sleep with 5G masts, it is a line he would do well to retire.",

      "A £17.1million price tag for a 28-year-old who starred during his time in England and has remained a fixture of the Portugal side since his move to Saudi would be a steal, though it’s not a surprise that the massive wages aren’t rousing many clubs.",
      "If United don’t see paying a big fee for any of the three Premier League midfielders they are tracking as plausible in the winter window, then they’re very unlikely to splash out on a huge contract instead.",
      "Neves would be a great signing in January if his wages were less of a strain, but they’d surely have to be significantly reduced, given the Red Devils’ highest wage is £350,000 per week, and that’s one of only two players who earn over £200,000 per week.",
      "Man Utd could still sign Ruben Neves from Al-Hilal in the January transfer window but there’s one main stumbling block, according to reports.",
      "Former Tottenham scout Bryan King has told Spurs they have “got to” land a former Premier League star on £410,000 per week, as a separate report has revealed his desire ...",
      "According to reports, a Manchester United ‘midfielder transfer’ is ‘gaining momentum’ ahead of the winter transfer window for four reasons.",
      "Man Utd have reportedly identified former Wolves midfielder Ruben Neves as their new ‘priority’ target in midfield ahead of the January transfer window.",
      "According to reports, Manchester United are already ‘preparing’ a record ‘offer’ for Brighton star Carlos Baleba as they look to make an ‘historic signing’."

      "Manchester United are still said to be ‘pushing’ for a teenage striker, but Borussia Dortmund have joined them in the race for his signature, per Florian Plettenberg.",
      "United’s attack has strengthened in recent times. After they finished 15th in the Premier League last term and no player hit double figures for goals, they added three expensive signings to their forward line.",
      "Matheus Cunha, Benjamin Sesko and Bryan Mbeumo all joined, and the trio have all made an impact – Mbeumo in particular as he scooped the Premier League player of the month award for October.",
      "United chairman Sir Jim Ratcliffe is known to want to fish out some top talents before they become such, though, so Swedish teenager Kevin Filling could also soon be signed.",
      "It was revealed of late that amid interest from United, Filling could leave AIK in the winter, with his value at €3million (£2.6m).",
      "It was stated then that some Bundesliga clubs were interested in landing the 16-year-old forward, who has two goals in nine games for AIK in 2025.",
      "Now, Plettenberg has named one of those sides in an update on the potential movements of Filling.",
      "Speaking on X, he stated that Borussia Dortmund are now in the race for Filling, as Sebastian Kehl wants to sign him.",
      "The insider states that United are ‘still pushing’ to sign the striker, but no agreement has been made with any club yet.",
      "It is maintained that Filling could leave AIK as early as January, but where he lands is still to be decided.",
      "Ratcliffe’s desire to sign players of his ilk is clear, though. Filling has made his mark for Sweden under-18s, scoring twice on his debut just a few months ago.",
      "He already looks a player who could go on to achieve things in the game, and that’s exactly the type of player Ratcliffe suggested he wanted when he first walked through the door at United.",
      "He said: “What I would rather do, I would rather find the next Mbappe, rather than spend a fortune to just try and buy success.",
      "“It’s not that clever, is it? Buying Mbappe. In a way. Anyone could figure that one out. But what is much more challenging is to find the next Mbappe or the next [Jude] Bellingham or the next Roy Keane.”"

      "Ruben Amorim says he now expects his Manchester United team to be \"more competitive in every way\" as he prepares them for a Monday Night Football clash with Everton one year on from his first game in charge.",
      "Amorim got off to a flying start at Ipswich on November 24, 2024, with Marcus Rashford scoring after just two minutes but United were pegged back and drew 1-1.",
      "Reflecting on that game ahead of the anniversary, Amorim says he immediately realised the scale of the task he had taken on. But after what he himself called a \"disaster\" first season, in which United finished 15th in the Premier League and lost the Europa League final to Tottenham, he is quietly encouraged by the progress his side have made this term.",
      "United are five games unbeaten in the Premier League and sit sixth in the table, ahead of the weekend fixtures.",
      "\"There was everything really fast,\" Amorim said about his appointment and the lead-in to his first game as United boss.",
      "\"The first thinking was the environment is completely different. I was excited with that. Right away I knew we'd struggle in some things. But it was that feeling of this was the best league in the world, maybe the best club in the world but at the same time it's a big job, it's going to require a lot of work.\"",
      "On the progress his team have made during his year in charge, Amorim said: \"We are showing that but the important thing is it doesn't matter what we did in the recent games. We cannot forget we start in that point to suffer a lot last year, we have to take that into account and play every game like the last one or the first one.",
      "\"Of course, I expect a team with more control, more dominant, playing better football and, the most important thing, more competitive in every way.\"",
      "Amorim confirmed in his pre-match press conference that Benjamin Sesko would be out for \"a few weeks\" with the knee injury which forced him off at Tottenham in the final match before the international break and said the striker's return could overlap with Bryan Mbeumo and Amad Diallo leaving for the Africa Cup of Nations.",
      "Harry Maguire will not be fit to face Everton but Kobbie Mainoo could be fit to return to action in time for Monday's game.",
      "It's not been a year to remember for Manchester United supporters - but in the past six weeks confidence has grown that, finally, Amorim may have their team on the right track.",
      "A first victory at Anfield in nine years, a five-game unbeaten run in the Premier League and a flood of goals offer encouragement.",
      "Ending that incredulously long wait for back-to-back top-flight wins hints at previously elusive consistency in the team's play - aided, of course, by a £232m summer spend and squad revamp.",
      "There were fleeting moments of delight in Amorim's first season - the late win at Manchester City, for example, or the Europa League smashings of Real Sociedad and Athletic Club either side of that wild extra-time triumph against Lyon.",
      "The hope now is that something more substantial and long-lasting is emerging.",
      "But there have been so many bad moments, so many ugly moments, that, on Amorim's first-year anniversary, no United supporter should be getting carried away just yet.",
      "Amorim himself has described his side as \"probably the worst team in the history\" of the club (more of his knockout quotes to come later) and his return of 45 points from 38 Premier League games in charge is an inescapable reflection of how his reign has gone so far, i.e. not good.",
      "He has the worst record of any successor to Sir Alex Ferguson and his Premier League points tally ranks United 14th out of 17 ever-present teams across his time in charge.",
      "There have been many bruising defeats along the way. The Europa League final loss to Ange Postecoglou's Tottenham was the most costly, with United not only missing out on the trophy but also a Champions League place and the financial rewards that brings.",
      "It was also a defeat which further amplified criticism of Amorim's stubborn commitment to 3-4-2-1, with Postecoglou's own tactics change key to Spurs' win.",
      "There have been many wretched, painful defeats at Old Trafford, with home fans watching on as their side lost to Nottingham Forest, Bournemouth, Newcastle, Brighton, Crystal Palace, Wolves and West Ham in the league and to Fulham on penalties in the FA Cup.",
      "But Amorim's most embarrassing moment was to come in Grimsby in August. The sight of the head coach frantically rearranging pieces on a miniature tactics board and then cowering in the dugout as his team contrived to get knocked out of the Carabao Cup by their League Two hosts was alarming imagery.",
      "More brutal defeats have followed, at Manchester City and then Brentford, but Amorim has clambered off the canvas. He and Manchester United are back on their feet for now. But will there be a knockout blow to come - or can they recover from the punishment they've suffered?",
      "\"If we want to win the Premier League we have to run like mad dogs. If not, we are not going to.\" - Amorim's rallying cry as he took charge of United. His team ranked 14th for distance covered and total sprints last season.",
      "\"In 10 games in the Premier League, we won two. We are being the worst team maybe in the history of Manchester United. I know that you want headlines, but I'm saying that because we have to acknowledge that and to change that. Here you go, your headlines.\" Amorim's stunning assessment of his side in January, before they finished in their lowest Premier League place of 15th.",
      "\"I would put [Manchester United goalkeeper coach Jorge] Vital [on] before a player who doesn't give the maximum every day.\" Amorim's brutal statement when asked about Marcus Rashford missing from the matchday squad at Fulham in January. Vital was 63 at the time.",
      "\"If the board and the fans feel I'm not the right guy, I will go in the next day. But I will not quit again. I am confident in my job. As you see, I will not change anything in the way I do things.\" Amorim stands by his methods after the Europa League final loss to Tottenham.",
      "\"Sometimes I want to quit, sometimes I want to be here for 20 years… Sometimes I hate my players, sometimes I love my players - this is my way of doing things. I am going to be like that. In that moment, I was so frustrated.\" Amorim explains what he meant when he said 'The players spoke really loud today,' after losing at Grimsby.",
      "\"When we win it's not the system; when we lose it's the system.\" Amorim bristles at continued criticism of his 3-4-2-1 set-up after defeat at Brentford in September.",

      "Monday 24 November 2025 08:30, UK",
      "Matthijs de Ligt has emerged as Ruben Amorim's most important Manchester United player this season.",
      "A stalwart at the back, the central defender is the only player to have played every single minute of United's Premier League campaign so far this term.",
      "With Amorim a known tinkerman, not least during games, especially at centre-back, De Ligt's ever presence is a testament to his growing influence at Old Trafford.",
      "When De Ligt signed for United in August 2024, Old Trafford had acquired a then-24-year-old who had struggled to live up to the lofty billing of his early career.",
      "Having captained Ajax at 18, De Ligt was tipped to become one of the game's finest defenders. He became the first defender to win the Golden Boy in 2018, the trophy awarded to the best U21 player.",
      "That was before his starring role in the Champions League as Ajax famously reached the semi-final in 2019, where his displays in that campaign propelled his worth.",
      "A move to Juventus came next for the defender, with the world at his feet, and Bayern Munich also followed. However, despite a healthy trophy return in that period, the pace of his early development had slowed, and De Ligt had become an injury-prone disappointment.",
      "Now, it seems as though De Ligt has been living through a personal renaissance. At 26, things have started to come together for the Dutchman. He's often used as the right centre-back in Amorim's oft-discussed back three but is more than capable of filling in centrally.",
      "On the opening day, a colossal performance, despite defeat to Arsenal, saw De Ligt take care of Viktor Gyokeres in a showing that paved for things to come.",
      "In the league, his performances have sustained, standing as one of United's outstanding options at the back. Among defenders at the club, De Ligt leads the way for aerial duels won and interceptions.",
      "De Ligt is also among United's best tacklers and passers, factoring in defenders at the club. They are performances that have been rewarded with a recall into the Netherlands National team by boss Ronald Koeman.",
      "For the Dutchman, his upturn in form is a reflection of a growing maturity and fewer injuries.",
      "\"I'm 26 now and I'm entering the best years of my career, both physically and mentally,\" De Ligt told Dutch outlet NOS.",
      "\"I've changed my mindset. Initially, I didn't want to make mistakes; now I want to do as many good things as possible.'",
      "Asked about his form, De Ligt added: \"There are a few explanations for that. I've had quite a few injuries in recent years, which took a toll on my confidence in my body.",
      "\"This year, I was able to participate in the entire pre-season. I know the club and the league better, and you feel more confident and can be more dominant.",
      "\"I'm actually doing more strength training again now. Just like I used to. So I don't care about that kind of criticism anymore. Although I did a few years ago. But I've been through a lot and now know what's good for me. I won't be deviating from that anytime soon.\"",
      "De Ligt's goal to earn United a draw at Tottenham just before the international break felt like the culmination of months of assured displays. However, despite his history as a leader, De Ligt was not named in Amorim's leadership group.",
      "Bruno Fernandes, Lisandro Martinez, Harry Maguire, Diogo Dalot, Tom Heaton and Noussair Mazraoui were put forward by Amorim as his group to oversee the dressing room at the beginning of the season.",
      "\"Sometimes there are players who lead in the way they play,\" Amorim said following the draw at Spurs.",
      "\"Then there are players who have a different involvement in everything that happens in Carrington.",
      "\"I am just trying to put different styles in the leadership group. But in the end, everyone has to be a leader and to help each other.\"",
      "Amorim's growing reliance on De Ligt, may be a cause for the Portuguese coach to rethink his decision. However, despite De Ligt's form, Amorim believes we are yet to see the Dutchman at his flying best.",
      "\"He is doing really well, really aggressive, is defending well,\" Amorim added after the Spurs game.",

      "Premier League clubs have approved a new alternative PSR, called Squad Cost Ratio (SCR); clubs will now be allowed to spend 85 per cent of their revenue, with these finances monitored each season; clubs voted against an anchoring system which many felt was effectively a 'salary cap'",
      "Friday 21 November 2025 18:08, UK",
      "Premier League clubs have voted against a new proposal that could have brought in a salary cap from the 2026/27 season, with the division's Profit and Sustainability Rules (PSR) to be replaced by Squad Cost Ratio (SCR) system from next term.",
      "The 20 Premier League clubs voted on three main issues - Squad Cost Ratio, a Sustainability and Systematic Resilience Proposal (SSR) and a Top to Bottom Anchoring (TBA) proposal in a meeting on Friday.",
      "The SCR and SSR rules were voted through, with the SCR voted through via the slimmest of margins. Fourteen out of the 20 Premier League clubs voted in favour of the SCR rules, which was the minimum number of votes needed to pass through the proposals.",
      "The TBA regulations - which would have limited spending on squad costs to five times the amount the bottom club receives from the Premier League in broadcast and prize money, and could have introduced a salary cap as part of its rules - did not receive sufficient support.",
      "Seven clubs were in favour of the anchoring system, 12 clubs voted against it - with one choosing not to vote.",
      "Before the vote on TBA, the Professional Footballers' Association (PFA) and some of the UK's biggest player agencies were preparing to take legal action if anchoring was introduced. They felt it was effectively a salary cap on players.",
      "After a legal challenge in 2021, the PFA stopped the EFL introducing a salary cap in League One and Two.",
      "Players and agents warned the Premier League that any rules which included a salary cap would have be challenged in court.",
      "From the 2026-27 season, Premier League clubs will be allowed to spend a maximum of 85 per cent of their revenue on squad costs - which cover player wages, amortised transfers and agents' fees.",
      "Nine Premier League clubs playing in Europe this season are already bound by UEFA's SCR rules which limit spending to 70 per cent of revenue.",
      "A shadow form of SCR has been trialled in the background alongside PSR since the middle of last season.",
      "Each club will be set a 'green threshold' of 85 per cent of their revenues, and a 'red threshold' - an absolute spending limit up to 30 per cent over the green threshold.",
      "Assessments will take place on March 1 of each year after the January transfer window, with monitoring in October.",
      "If a club is above the green threshold, but under the red, they will receive a fine but not a 'sporting sanction', which would be a points deduction.",
      "If a club is above the red threshold, they will face a sporting sanction. This will be a fixed six-point deduction, which increases by one point for every £6.5m spent over the red threshold.",
      "Clubs can appeal both financial and point penalties. A club will have seven days to challenge the board's decision, having first informally written to the league to try and resolve the issue.",
      "According to the Premier League, PSR and SCR differ in what they measure.",
      "PSR evaluates a club's overall profit by including all revenues and costs, while SCR focuses specifically on on-pitch spending.",
      "By concentrating on squad costs, SCR gives clubs greater freedom to invest in other aspects of their operations.",
      "Under PSR, clubs are assessed based on their financial performance over a rolling three-year period, whereas the SCR sets clear spending limits for each season, which clubs must adhere to throughout that campaign.",
      "Compliance is monitored in-season as well as at the end of the season, allowing for earlier intervention if a club is breaching the rules. That means a club could receive punishments - for example, a point deduction - at any point of the season, rather than solely at the end of the campaign.",
      "According to the Premier League, this shift encourages clubs to manage their finances responsibly in real time, rather than relying on longer-term financial balancing.",
      "On top of that, because clubs announce their revenues in advance of the season, they are given more certainties regarding how much money they can spend.",
      "Under the PSR rules, clubs were susceptible to falling into financial trouble due to unforeseen dips in revenue - caused by poor performances on the pitch, a loss in matchday revenue or commercial revenues falling.",
      "According to the Premier League, it is introducing three SSR tests to improve clubs' financial sustainability and 'investability' over the short, medium and long-term, taking into account prevailing market conditions.",
      "The three tests are:",
      "Working Capital Test -  Assessment of a club's immediately available cash headroom across a season to ensure it can manage required outgoings and unforeseen fluctuations, particularly between transfer windows. A club must demonstrate that, for each calendar month over the course of a season, the sum of its projected cash balances and qualifying working capital funds is at least £12.5m.",
      "Liquidity Test - Assessment of a club's liquidity headroom over two seasons, including market value of player registrations, to ensure it can account for its current financial position and handle a variety of financial shocks inherent to the industry. A club must demonstrate that, for the current and following season, its 'Liquidity Headroom' is zero or positive having absorbed a 'Stress Test' of £85m. The Stress Test accounts for a variety of potential negative events, such as failing to qualify for Europe as one example.",
      "Positive Equity Test - Assessment of a club's balance sheet to evaluate its financial health, ensuring it has sufficient leverage to manage macro-economic factors. A club must demonstrate that its 'Positive Equity Ratio' (liabilities ÷ adjusted assets) is less than or equal to 90 per cent in the 2026/27 season, 85 per cent in the 2027/28 season and 80 per cent from the 2028/29 season onwards.",
      "Each tests take place on July 7 each year. For newly-promoted clubs, they will be assessed on the Liquidity and Positive Equity tests on October 31.",
      "Clubs may also face a 'Call-In Event' where they would be assessed further on whether they are complying to the rules.",
      "If they do not comply with the rules, the Premier League will offer solutions whereby the club could return to compliance. They could include voluntary spending limitations, cash injections, or rebalancing their debt or equity positions.",
      "Clubs could also be asked to present a business plan of how to bring the club back into within the rules. Failure to present a business plan would lead to sanctions from the Premier League.",
      "Those sanctions could include asking permission from the league to register any new players, a spending limit being imposed or more serious sanctions that are currently in place within the PSR structure, such as a points deduction.",
      "The Premier League is also closing a loophole which allowed clubs to sell assets to associated parties in order to comply with financial regulations.",
      "Under the current Profitability & Sustainability Rules, clubs have been able to sell assets to companies linked to their owners in order to increase their revenues to ensure they do not lose more than the permitted £105m over three years.",
      "From next season, the SCR calculation will be based solely on clubs' football revenues so there will be no regulatory benefit arising from asset sales to associated parties.",
      "In September last year, Chelsea's owners sold two hotels at Stamford Bridge to a sister company for £76.5m. They also sold their women's team to a parent company for £200m in June 2024.",
      "Everton also sold their women's team to a parent company in June, a move that is no longer possible.",

      "Manchester United should come with a disclaimer: 'entertaining but structurally unstable.'",
      "Ruben Amorim has a team overflowing with attacking talent, energy and moments of genuine quality yet one that carries enough defensive looseness to turn every 90 minutes into a wild ride. There have been 37 goals in their Premier League games - working to an average of 3.36 per 90. No team averages higher.",
      "They are the must-watch team in the Premier League because of it.",
      "Amorim has realised that they are a team built for moments - not for consistency - and he's embracing it.",
      "And, goals at both ends are becoming the smartest angle in United's games.",
      "This looks a clash where both teams will fancy themselves going forward and neither will fully trust themselves without the ball. Sky Bet go 10/11 on both teams to score and over 2.5 goals, and that looks very backable considering the direction of travel in United games."

      "Which Premier League teams are overachieving and underachieving this season? And will Arsenal be caught?",
      "Eleven games in, the season's main narratives have already emerged.",
      "Arsenal are the team to catch following their strong start to the campaign. Manchester City, rather than faltering champions Liverpool, are seen as their most likely title rivals. At the other end of table, bottom side Wolves are already at risk of getting cut off.",
      "But what's your team's true performance level this season?",
      "Our expected table measures underlying performance data rather than results and the standings might surprise you.",
      "Crystal Palace are rated as the third-best performing team in the division behind Arsenal and Manchester City, while struggling Liverpool should be four places better off in fourth.",
      "Newcastle and newly-promoted Leeds are also underperforming significantly. They sit sixth and seventh in the expected table, eight and nine places better off respectively.",
      "Ruben Amorim's side face Everton on Monday Night Football on a five-game unbeaten run in the Premier League but the expected table has them three places worse off in 10th, suggesting their performances haven't been as good as recent results suggest.",
      "One team conspicuous by its absence from the top half of the expected table is Sunderland.",
      "Regis Le Bris' side are flying high in fourth having amassed 19 points from their first 11 games following promotion but the expected table has them a whopping 14 places lower, as the third-worst performers in the Premier League so far, based on xG, with an expected points total of eight.",
      "Burnley and Fulham should also be in the relegation zone, with bottom side Wolves placing 17th. Wolves have only taken two points from their first 11 games but their expected points total is nine.",
      "Nottingham Forest, like Wolves, should be in a much better position, according to xG, but the expected table is grim reading for Spurs and Aston Villa, who should be nine and 10 places worse off respectively according to underlying performance data.",
      "But how will it look at the end of the season?",
      "Liverpool are predicted to come third despite sitting eighth as things stand, with Chelsea completing the top four and Manchester United in fifth, a position that could clinch Champions League qualification, depending on this season's coefficient.",
      "Crystal Palace are also predicted to clinch a European finish in sixth, along with Spurs, who sit a place below the Eagles in seventh. Sunderland are ninth, with Aston Villa only just squeezing into the top half in 10th.",
      "While Newcastle fans are hopeful their team's form will recover following a poor start, the predicted table has them 14th, which would be their lowest finish since being relegated in 2015/16.",
      "Relegation could become a reality for West Ham, according to our predicted table. The Hammers won back to back games before the international break but Nuno Espirito Santo's side are tipped to go down in 18th, along with Burnley and Wolves.",
      "That means Leeds, as well as Sunderland, are predicted to survive, with Burnley the only promoted team expected to go straight down.",
      "Nottingham Forest, currently second from bottom having appointed their third manager of the season in Sean Dyche, are expected to fight their way out of trouble and finish 16th.",

      "Wednesday 12 November 2025 13:02, UK",
      "It has been a breakthrough season for Radek Vitek.",
      "The Manchester United goalkeeper has enjoyed a hugely beneficial loan spell so far at Bristol City - a move that came around because City's previous No 1 Max O'Leary suffered an ankle injury at the end of last season which forced the club to move for a short-term replacement.",
      "Vitek was brought in on a season-long loan but has surpassed any expectations from when he first arrived at the club and is now keeping O'Leary out of the team having recovered from his injury, due to a run of dominant performances by the young Czech keeper.",
      "\"It's true it came a little bit out of nowhere,\" Vitek said. \"I knew I was going to go on loan this season because I had an agreement with the coach it was the best thing to do and get more experience at a higher level than last year.",
      "\"It was a no-brainer because to play in the Championship for a club such as Bristol City for me was really attractive.",
      "\"I said yes straight away after I spoke with Gerhard Struber.\"",
      "Vitek had previously been on loan at Accrington Stanley in League Two before spending a season in Austria but Vitek's impressive form for City has helped lead them to eighth in the table.",
      "\"I'm still quite young but I would describe myself as a goalkeeper who likes to be both dominant and also confident for the team in front of me so they can rely on me,\" Vitek explained.",
      "\"Everything since day one has come together. The people around the club, the city… everyone has been really nice to me since day one and the fans have been amazing.",
      "\"First game away from home, Sheffield Wednesday... to celebrate the win like that was an amazing memory. I don't think I'll ever forget this one.\"",
      "Having grown up in Czechia, Vitek admitted he was a shy kid growing up - perhaps more introverted than you would expect from a now 6ft 6in goalkeeper.",
      "Vitek admitted he did not start out his footballing journey in goal and he used to play every position when he was younger, but as with other kids who hit a growth spurt earlier than others, he was thrown into goal because he was always the tallest in his age group.",
      "Having joined Czech side SK Sigma Olomouc's academy, Vitek was soon invited to trial for different clubs in England after catching the eye in his home country.",
      "But for Vitek, at just 16-years-old there was only one club he was interested in signing for.",
      "\"I knew straight away that Manchester United wanted me,\" Vitek said. \"They told me straight after seven weeks' trial, they told me they want me to sign.",
      "\"It was the time when Covid hit though - I spent six months at home but I didn't have any doubts because I felt really confident with the conversations I had with the coaches in Manchester.",
      "\"Obviously my club knew as well about the interest and they already spoke with Manchester United about the contracts and everything like that so it was basically done - some of my team-mates couldn't believe it because it's not an everyday thing someone goes from a Czech academy to a club like Manchester United.\"",
      "Almost six years on from signing for the club, this feels like a huge milestone in Vitek's footballing journey and development.",
      "Playing regularly, showing what he can do at the size of a club like Bristol City is clearly doing him wonders.",
      "It was undoubtedly pleasing for those at Manchester United as well, as he is highly-rated at Carrington. Despite Senne Lammens impressing at United since his summer arrival, the No 1 shirt still feels there to be fought for at this moment in time.",
      "So could we see Radek Vitek in that shirt one day?",
      "\"I'm taking it step-by-step, we'll see next summer what's best for me,\" Vitek said. \"I speak on a regular basis with my goalkeeper coach from Manchester United who has come here to watch my games and I have a good connection with them.",
      "\"I know they're watching me and I really appreciate that I'm not just the guy who is being forgotten or anything.",
      "\"Obviously long term, I would love to play for Manchester United one day but also I'm realistic and I know that my pathway can lead somewhere different as well.\"",
