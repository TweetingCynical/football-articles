      "Mathieu Debuchy slammed Arsene Wenger for blocking a potential move to Manchester United. The former Arsenal defender was candid about his wish to leave the club in December 2016 after joining from the Gunners' Sunday opponents Newcastle two years prior.",
      "The right-back was signed for around £12million, having previously enjoyed a successful period at Lille where he clinched the Ligue 1 title in 2011. In his debut season with the Gunners, Debuchy was restricted to just 15 appearances across all competitions due to injuries.",
      "Upon regaining full fitness, he found it difficult to replace Hector Bellerin as the first-choice right-back. In the 2015/16 season, he only played twice before securing a loan move to Bordeaux in the January transfer window, hoping to secure a spot in France's Euro 2016 squad.",
      "Despite returning to his home country, Debuchy expressed frustration over how he was treated at Arsenal. He claimed that the Gunners had stopped a possible move to Premier League rivals United a year earlier and admitted that he barely spoke with Wenger.",
      "Reflecting on his proposed move to Old Trafford, Debuchy told L’Equipe, as per ESPN: \"I wasn't playing a lot, it was United, there's nothing else to say.",
      "\"For me, it was almost unexpected, but the coach said no. It's something I did not appreciate. He wasn't using me, so I didn't see his interest in doing that.\"",
      "When asked about his relationship with veteran Arsenal boss Wenger, Debuchy revealed he barely communicated with his fellow Frenchman. \"We acknowledge each other, we say hello, nothing more,\" he added.",
      "Debuchy claimed that Arsenal had blocked his transfer to Old Trafford, forcing him to join Bordeaux, where he featured nine times. Despite rumoured interest from clubs including Espanyol and Fiorentina, he couldn't secure a permanent switch and encountered a similar scenario once more in December 2016, though fitness issues prevented him from securing a fresh start.",
      "\"My situation doesn't meet what I had been hoping for, but that's football,\" he said. \"There have been things, injuries and the coach's choices that have meant that I haven't played. Even if I don't understand, I'm not surprised, I know how it works. [I want] a way out. I want to take on a new challenge, to get back into it, to simply do my job properly.\"",
      "However, Debuchy's accusations didn't go unanswered. Arsenal manager Wenger rejected the notion that Arsenal had prevented a potential switch to United and also addressed other transfer speculation concerning the defender.",
      "\"They have never made an offer for him,\" Wenger said, as per the Guardian. \"It's completely untrue. It's sometimes surprising to hear things like that.",
      "\"When he had the opportunities to play when Bellerín was injured, he was injured [too]. So I cannot do anything about that. I gave him last year the opportunity to go to Bordeaux on loan, but we had nobody coming in for him over the summer period and there are some things that are not true in this article.",
      "\"We never blocked him to go to Fiorentina, nor Espanyol. They had no interest in him at all because we checked that, so you have to take this [L'Equipe] article with a little distance.\"",
      "Debuchy eventually got his wish to leave Arsenal in January 2018, six months before his Gunners contract expired. He moved to Saint Etienne without a transfer fee and remained there for three and a half years. He then enjoyed a two-year stint with Valenciennes before retiring in 2023.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Manchester United and Ruben Amorim's 3-1 defeat to Brentford was dubbed \"a joke\" by Usain Bolt. Exiled defender Tyrell Malacia also sent the Red Devils' head coach a telling message.",
      "Amorim's men suffered their third loss of the new Premier League season on Saturday when they travelled to the Gtech Community Stadium. Bees striker Igor Thiago fired in a first-half double before Benjamin Sesko pulled one back, and although United were given a penalty on 76 minutes, Bruno Fernandes failed to convert.",
      "Brentford bagged a third goal to seal United's fate deep in added time, and during a calamitous first half, one of the club's more high-profile fans, 100m and 200m world record holder Bolt, branded the performance a \"joke.\"",
      "Brentford's first goal on Saturday saw Harry Maguire play striker Thiago onside before he slotted home past Altay Bayindir after just nine minutes. Less than 10 minutes later, and it was 2-0, the Brazilian bagging his second, with United's goalkeeper parrying a cross into his path.",
      "This disastrous opening 20 minutes had some fans up in arms, and even Bolt couldn't help but voice his frustrations. He took to social media and posted to X: \"This must be a joke.\"",
      "Fans in the comments of this post were equally as frustrated, with one writing: \"United are a joke. Have been for a decade.\" Another added: \"Even Bolt cannot believe how useless this club is.\"",
      "Although Sesko pulled one back for the visitors, his first goal for the club, Amorim's side were yet again defeated. The Portuguese head coach is yet to win two consecutive Premier League matches in charge of the Red Devils.",
      "Away from the Brentford clash, outcast Malacia has proven to potential suitors and Amorim that he is ready to play. Failing to secure a move away this summer was another blow for the Dutchman, who has endured a torrid spell in Manchester after being brought to the club under Erik ten Hag.",
      "Though he arrived as a potential starting full-back, Malacia has found minutes tough to come by. He was sidelined for over 500 days after suffering a knee injury in 2023, which hasn't helped his cause.",
      "Moves to Elche in Spain and Turkey didn't materialise over the summer, after he spent the second half of last season on loan at PSV. Now, Malacia finds himself in exile, not suited to Amorim's wing-backed formation.",
      "However, the 26-year-old has indicated that he is ready to lace up his boots again, posting to Instagram videos of himself training at non-league side Trafford FC. He has shown both Amorim and any coaches of clubs who could look to take him on in January that he is keeping match-fit.",
      "Kobbie Mainoo was introduced after 66 minutes against Brentford, and while he failed to make too much of an impact, he has shown glimpses of promise in recent weeks. Amorim continues to play Manuel Ugarte at the base of his midfield, however.",
      "Red Devils icon Ferdinand thinks the head coach must do all he can to get Mainoo more minutes, and he told the MEN: \"If he was agitating to get a loan now, if he is not playing in January, he will be agitating and knocking the door down even more to go and get game time.",
      "\"You have to have two hats in these situations. If you think about it, being a player again, you have got to be thinking about yourself in these situations. You are lucky to go to multiple tournaments in your career, you are lucky to go to just one tournament, so I understand that with my selfish, football player hat on, thinking about England and yourself.",
      "\"But, at the same time, if you are thinking long-term for Manchester United, I think Manchester United have to find a way of getting this kid in the team, he is a huge talent.\"",

      "Ruben Amorim's side found themselves trailing by two goals at the Gtech Community Stadium within 20 minutes as Thiago wreaked havoc. Sesko dragged United back into contention just before half-time from close quarters at the third attempt.",
      "Bruno Fernandes was presented with the opportunity to level from the penalty spot midway through the second period when Nathan Collins brought down Bryan Mbeumo, but his feeble attempt was kept out by Caoimhin Kelleher.",
      "Brentford stood firm for the remaining minutes and clinched a third during added time when Jensen unleashed a brilliant strike that rocketed past Altay Bayindir.",

      "American referee David Gerson reckons Brentford should have been reduced to 10 men during Manchester United's crushing 3-1 defeat at the G-Tech Community Stadium. Brentford defender Nathan Collins escaped a red card after hauling down Bryan Mbeumo in the second half. The Bees defender pulled back his former teammate inside the box.",
      "Referee Craig Pawson brandished a yellow card whilst Video Assistant Referee Andy Madley, working alongside assistant Nicholas Hopton, reviewed the incident at Stockley Park and ruled it wasn't worthy of a dismissal. Bruno Fernandes stepped up to take the penalty with Brentford leading 2-1, but his strike was kept out.",
      "Justifying the call, the Premier League Match Centre posted on X: \"The referee's call of penalty was checked and confirmed by VAR – with Collins deemed to pulled Mbeumo back. VAR also checked the referee's call of yellow card to Collins - and deemed that Mbeumo wasn't in control of the ball.\"",
      "Yet Gerson, who shared his thoughts on Instagram, took issue with the Premier League's stance.",
      "\"This is absolutely a red card for denial of obvious goalscoring opportunity,\" he declared. \"How this was only a yellow card and penalty, I don't understand. Let me go ahead and dispel some myths, double jeopardy, you can't give a red card in a penalty kick. Absolutely, you can. The laws have changed over the years, it used to be the case you couldn't, now you can.",
      "\"The second thing, what are DOGSO (Denial of Goal Scoring Opportunity) conditions, so distance, absolutely met, number of defenders, there's no one between the foul and the goal, and then you got direction, he's right in the middle of the field, he's going towards goal and then, likely to control.",
      "\"That's right, you don't need to have control of the ball for it to be a red card, for DOGSO opportunity. This ball has not come across him yet and he's being pulled back so the foul has occurred, he's being pulled away from the ball, he absolutely has likelihood of control - a slow rolling ball for a Premier League or running onto the ball, that is absolute likelihood of control.",
      "\"So the correct decision should be a red card and a penalty kick. How they did not award this, I don't understand because it makes a difference, right. We got 15 minutes left in the game, player gets sent off and obviously they missed the penalty kick, but still, now you're playing 11 vs 10 men.",
      "\"I am really interested to hear PGMOL's explanation of this one.\" United endured their third league defeat of the campaign, sparking fresh doubts about Ruben Amorim's tenure.",

      "United had hoped their 2-1 victory over Chelsea the previous weekend might signal a fresh start as they looked to build momentum under the former Sporting Lisbon chief. Despite Benjamin Sesko netting his maiden goal for United, a first-half brace from Igor Thiago and Mathias Jensen's late strike condemned the visitors to another disappointing result in West London.",
      "The setback has intensified scrutiny on Amorim after last campaign's dismal 15th-place finish - United's worst in Premier League history. Former Arsenal defender Keown has now delivered a scathing assessment of Amorim's reign, drawing parallels with the pressure Graham Potter faced at West Ham before his dismissal on Saturday.",
      "\"It seemed obvious that [Graham] Potter was going to lose his job [at West Ham], so with Amorim, why is it not the same for him?\" Keown questioned on BBC Sport.",
      "\"Is it because we're now the ninth manager in 12 years since Sir Alex Ferguson left? This stubbornness to play the same way - they look very ordinary.",
      "\"Mbeumo playing against his old team must be wondering 'what on earth have I signed for?' because the team he plays against, his old team, was way better than them today. This is Manchester United in dire trouble right now. Decisions need to be made.\"",

United were 2-0 down after 20 minutes, with Brentford forward Igor Thiago scoring twice, before Benjamin Sesko pulled one back with his first goal since his £74million summer move.",
      "Skipper Bruno Fernandes missed a penalty to make it 2-2, with Brentford sub Mathias Jensen scoring with a fine strike in added time to compound United's miserable afternoon. Despite this latest setback, Amorim said he remains confident he can turn United around – despite their shambolic run of results under him suggesting otherwise.",
      "“I'm always doing my job,” said Amorim. “If I win, I'm in a different state of mind. That is normal, but I'm always confident, because I know what to do. It's my job and I'm not here just to protect the players. I'm trying to do what is best for the club and the team.",

      "“I try to be really objective in my analysis of the game. Today we played Brentford's game, not our own game. And when you play the opponent's game, it's harder to win. When we win, it's not the system, when we lose it's the system. I understand that. I think it's more that we play this game like Brentford wanted to play this game.",
      "“We never settled down to play our game. We never pushed the opponent. We knew that every time they recovered the ball, they would make a run and they would fight for the ball. We need to work on a lot of things. My biggest concern is that we didn't settle down in the game. In the final third we missed a lot of crosses.",
      "“That's frustrating. We can do better with the ball. We can have more control. We can understand that sometimes when the decisions are not in your favour, the momentum is not in your favour, we can still control the ball.",
      "“When everything, the moments, the penalty, the foul before the first goal, all these things are against us, we need to have more personality to control the game and calm down the game.",

      "After a stint back in the Bundesliga with Dortmund and last season's ill-fated spell at Chelsea, he's now on loan at Aston Villa. And the Villans are hopeful that they can get the ex-Manchester City youngster back to something like his best, before signing him permanently at the end of the season.",

      "That's good news for Villa, who will have first refusal from Sancho and his camp, if he can make a success of his spell in the West Midlands.",
      "Sancho joined United in 2021 in a £73m deal that was widely seen as something of a coup at the time, such had been the impression he had made in Germany. But he never made a significant impact and was loaned back to Dortmund following a public bust-up with ex-United boss Erik ten Hag.",
      "He made 31 appearances for Chelsea last term, and helped them win the UEFA Conference League. But Chelsea were forced to pay United a £5m penalty fee, after rejecting the option to make the deal permanent for £25m.",
      "Sancho returned to United in June, but became one of five stars to find themselves banned from joining the squad for pre-season training by manager Ruben Amorim. He was told to stay away and resolve his future, which he did by engineering a move to Villa.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Manchester United and bitter rivals Liverpool are on a collision course in the transfer market once more - over Everton and England defender Jarrad Branthwaite.",
      "The centre-back is a long-time target of the Old Trafford top brass, who tried to sign him from the blue half of Merseyside before. But when the Toffees stuck to their asking price, that deal went away.",
      "However, United's interest in Branthwaite didn't and he remains their No.1 choice to replace Harry Maguire. The England defender turns 33 in March and is out of contract at the end of the season. The expectation is that United co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe won't be giving Maguire an extension to his current deal.",
      "United boss Ruben Amorim is planning for life without Maguire next season, while he also has doubts about the long-term fitness of injury prone defender Lisandro Martinez.",
      "That will see United move for Branthwaite again - but Liverpool are also very keen on the 23 year-old. It remains to be seen whether Branthwaite would be willing to make the move across Merseyside, but it hasn't stopped others in the past.",
      "And there can be no doubt that right now, a move to Liverpool rather than United is likely to be more tempting.",
      "However, Everton won't be easy to negotiate with, given Branthwaite has a deal until 2030 and he's one of their prized assets. Yet United may test the water with a £65m bid in the January transfer window, looking to steal an early march on the Premier League champions.",
      "Branthwaite is regarded as one of the brightest young prospects in English football.",

      "Defeat at Brentford was United's third in the league this season after losses against Arsenal and Manchester City, with Amorim acknowledging his side's continued failings. \"It's always the same to lose at this club, it hurts a lot,\" said Amorim. \"We need to think about the next one.\"",
      "\"Of course we want to win. We didn't control the game. We played the game of Brentford. First balls, second balls, set-pieces. All the crucial moments were against us. It's tough to lose again but we need to think about the next one.",

      "It turns out Ruben Amorim was right to say he had no idea which version of his Manchester United side would show up.",
      "Unfortunately for Amorim, the version that turned out at Brentford's Gtech Community Stadium was the one that continues to let down, frustrate and infuriate him and United's loyal fans.",
      "Every time this United team seems to have turned a corner, as they did with their hard-earned win over Chelsea the previous weekend, in which they showed hitherto unseen character and aggression, they somehow manage to regress and revert to type.",
      "When Brentford's third goal in added time, their fans taunted Amorim with chants of \"sacked in the morning\" and their returning former hero, Bryan Mbeumo, with cries of \"Bryan, what's the score?\", sparing neither as they revelled in their deserved victory.",
      "Here, the seeds of United's latest setback were sown inside the first 20 minutes, Brentford striker Igor Thiago profiting from the uncertainty in United's defence to plunder two goals.",
      "Where this leaves Amorim, only the United hierarchy know. There is an unwillingness to countenance the prospect that his position as head coach is under threat, after United's chief executive Omar Berrada went all out to hire him and in so doing put his own reputation on the line.",
      "But those in charge at United cannot hide from the glaring truth that the team is simply not showing enough signs of progress under Amorim. Seven points from a possible 18 is simply not acceptable, after he was backed in the summer with £236million worth of new signings to strengthen his squad.",
      "After this defeat, Amorim now has just nine wins from 33 Premier League games. For all the talk from inside the club about an improved xG, fewer shots conceded, more shots on target and a significant upturn in the data, the only stat that matters is results, which have been lamentable.",
      "A season without European football was supposed to be a blessing in disguise for United and Amorim, giving him free weeks to work with his players on his philosophy and system, but that argument has proved illusory, with the players just as unreliable and clueless as last season.",
      "Amorim made three changes from the Chelsea win, Diogo Dalot, Manuel Ugarte and Matheus Cunha coming in for the injured Noussair Mazraoui, the suspended Casemiro and Amad, absent following a family bereavement.",
      "There was no first Premier League start of the season for Kobbie Mainoo, with Ugarte given the nod to replace Casemiro, who was serving a one-match ban following his red card in the victory over Chelsea.",
      "United fell behind in the eighth minute, the defence having pushed up, allowing Jordan Henderson to pick out Thiago, who let the ball bounce once before thrashing a shot past Altay Bayindir, the ferocity of the shot giving the keeper no chance.",
      "Thiago notched his second of the game 12 minutes later, Brentford again exposing United's weakness down the right side, Bayindir palming away Kevin Schade's dangerous ball, but only as far as Thaigo, who steered it back over the line for the hosts to establish a 2-0 lead.",
      "United did not look like scoring, but £70m summer signing Benjamin Sesko gave them a lifeline in the 26 th minute, scoring his first goal since his move from RB Leipzig, with a fierce finish high into the net.",
      "Amorim's side failed to build any real momentum thereafter and never looked like scoring, but earned another lifeline in the 75th minute when Bryan Mbeumo – returning to his old club for the first time since his summer move - was brought down by Bees skipper Nathan Collins.",
      "United skipper Fernandes stepped up to take the resulting penalty – after a lengthy VAR check to see if the challenge from Collins warranted a red card – but failed from the spot for the second time this season, following his miss in a 1-1 draw at Fulham, with Caoimhin Kelleher saving his effort this time. United's misery was compounded in the 95th minute, when sub Mathias Jensen made it 3-1 with a majestic strike after a breakaway move.",
      "Next up for United are Sunderland at home. Given how well the Black Cats have started on their return to the Premier League, that promises to be another unsettling afternoon at Old Trafford for Amorim and his under-performing players.",
      "If this wretched run carries on much longer, Amorim is likely to be put out of his misery and go the same way as his five predecessors, all of whom followed Sir Alex Ferguson and failed in what has now become the impossible job.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

Referee Craig Pawson pointed to the spot after a brief pause before the video assistant referee reviewed the footage for a red card.",

      "Bruno Fernandes missed his second penalty of the Premier League season as Manchester United reverted to type in a disappointing defeat at Brentford. United came into the game on the back of the 2-1 win over Chelsea, yet familiar failing undermined their performance in west London.",
      "Brentford found themselves 2-0 up inside 20 minutes as Igor Thiago took advantage of some shaky United defending to help himself. First he latched onto a long ball over the top of the defence from Jordan Henderson to blast into the top corner before gobbling up a rebound after Altay Bayindir pushed the ball out into his path.",
      "United then finally woke up and Benjamin Sesko needed three bites of the cherry to slam in his first United goal from close range. Bayindir made a good low save to keep out Dango Ouattara before Nathan Collins' foul on Bryan Mbeumo offered a route back into the game for the away side.",
      "But after a long delay Fernandes saw his effort saved by penalty expert Caoimhin Kelleher and substitute Mathias Jensen made the three points safe for Brentford on the break in injury time as chants of \"you're getting sacked in the morning\" rang out from the stands. Here are the talking points after United made it eight league away games without a win.",
      "United were seen drilling their preparations for defending set pieces before kick off, but they didn't seem ready for what Brentford threw at them once the match started. The same old shaky backline, that has come to define Amorim's side, was there and Brentford took full advantage.",
      "If it wasn't for a few strong saves from Bayindir, they could easily have been 3-0 down following a nightmare start. Harry Maguire played Thiago onside for the first goal before Matthijs de Ligt found himself out of position for the second, which came from another simple long ball.",
      "It was a shambolic start for the away side, who had a week to prepare for this game, having already been knocked out of the Carabao Cup, the third round of which took place in midweek.",
      "This match was a perfect example of trend as Brentford's Michael Kayode and United's Diogo Dalot launched the ball into the box at every opportunity. It's nothing new at Brentford, who used the tactic successfully last season, but United have now jumped on the bandwagon.",
      "But, as Gronnemark warned, there's a lot more to it than simply chucking it and hoping. “For most teams, throw-ins are a really ugly part because the quality is so low, the ball is being thrown into high-pressure situations where there are duels,\" he said. \"There are too many chaotic throw-ins in the Premier League.\"",
      "Sesko arrived at United in a £73.7million deal from RB Leipzig with a lot of expectation on his shoulders. Having seen how Rasmus Hojlund struggled to cope with that, the Slovenian knew he needed to make a good impression early on. That didn't happen and there were signs of it beginning to get to him.",
      "His first United goal owed a lot to Caoimhin Kelleher, who failed to do with Patrick Dorgu's simple cross, but Sesko showed good determination to keep shooting. He couldn't miss the third go and the 22-year-old, who got 21 goals for Leipzig last season, is now off the mark in his seventh appearance.",
      "United's captain had the chance to bring his side level from the penalty spot after Nathan Collins pulled back Mbeumo in front of goal. Referee Craig Pawson took his time in pointing to the spot and there were further delays before Fernandes stepped up as VAR checked for a potential red card for denying a goalscoring opportunity.",
      "Brentford boss Keith Andrews then made him wait even longer by making a double substitution. Fernandes side-footed towards the corner but Kelleher kept up his impressive record in penalties, saving his fourth from seven outside of shoot-outs with Brentford and Liverpool.",
      "Fernandes, meanwhile, has now missed two out of three in the Premier League this season, having skied one at Craven Cottage earlier in the season.",
      "Amorim has been United manager since November 2024. His side are still yet to win back-to-back Premier League games under his management. The United fan who has vowed not to cut his hair until they win five in a row may be waiting a long time on this evidence.",
      "Watching games like this makes you wonder what they do all week on the training pitch. With no European football or Carabao Cup to consider, United have all week to prepare for their league matches, yet they were blown away inside the opening 20 minutes and then offered little as they chased the game. The penalty was a point gift-wrapped yet they shouldn't take advantage.",

      "\"It's really important for us to have that sense of urgency that we need to win no matter what, and it's going to be really difficult. Every time we start preparing the game and you watch the next opponent, you think, ‘It's going to be really, really tough’.",

      "Back in May, at the end of last season, Mbeumo was on the winning side when Brentford stormed past United at the G-Tech Community Stadium. The Cameroon international didn't get on the scoresheet, but he certainly caught Amorim's eye.",
      "On whether that particular display convinced the United boss to sign Mbeumo, he said: \"It was not that performance. But [it] helped me to understand that he's a very good player, not [just] with the ball, without the ball.",

      "During his lengthy lay-off, Malacia missed out on 70 United games and by the time he was fit again, Ten Hag had left the club. Under Amorim's new three-at-the-back system, with two wing-backs, Malacia found it hard to secure a spot.",

      "Fortunately for the Reds, Benjamin Sesko halved the deficit for United with his first goal for the club six minutes after Tudor's second. The striker was denied twice from close range before he smashed the ball into the roof of the net.",

      "Cristian Orozco has uploaded a cryptic post to his Instagram story ahead of a potential transfer to Manchester United. The 17-year-old midfielder has recently been linked with a move to Old Trafford following his impressive performances in Colombia.",
      "This means Orozco will remain at Fortaleza CEIF until July, and he'll rock up at Old Trafford boasting an already remarkable record. He has captained the Colombia Under-17s as they made it all the way to the South American Championship final earlier this year.",
      "As word spread about his potential move to United, Orozco headed to social media to share a message with his followers. Captioning a picture of Diego Maradona, who sadly passed in November 2020, he wrote: \"Good luck to all, blessings.\"",
      "The motive behind the post remain a mystery, but what's certain is that United are working hard to sign some of the world's most exciting young talents. The Colombian will be following in the footsteps of Sekou Kone, another teenage midfielder who recently joined United.",
      "Due to Brexit limitations, Ineos have adopted the strategy of casting their net wider to secure promising youngsters for their ranks. Diego Leon, the most high-profile signing since the shift in transfer strategy, was snapped up for a shrewd £3.3m in January, but he only joined the Reds in the summer.",
      "Leon is set to join his United teammates this afternoon for their face-off against Brentford, having been spotted at Stockport Train Station with the squad on Friday, ready for their journey to west London.",
      "Speaking reporters ahead of this weekend's clash at the G-Tech Community Stadium, Amorim claimed that he's starting to see the benefits of having more time with his players on the training pitch. The United boss said: \"You can try to work on different things, try to imagine different scenarios.",
      "\"You have more time, not just to prepare the next game in terms of the strategy for the game, but also to work on your base. And I think you can see that when we play, we create more situations.",
      "\"We are suffering goals that we suffered also last year. I think that has to be [to do] with that urgency, that focus, that understanding that we cannot lose games in.",
      "\"Especially nowadays, we are going to have situations to score, so we also need to focus [on] that, if we give time to the team not suffering goals, we are near to winning games.",
      "\"So, I think that is special, to have that time with the team, and we are improving because of that. I think we would struggle a lot if we had a game in the middle of the week.\"",
      "Amorim added: \"Now, I have always the feeling that we can win the next game, and we can be dominant. I have that feeling now. What I'm saying is that sometimes, in the small things, in that urgency.",
      "\"If you compare the way we start against Chelsea to the way we start against [Manchester] City, [it] is completely different. In that, I'm not certain, all the time, what is going to happen.",
      "\"And I'm really clear on that with you and with the players. But the feeling is completely different. I look at my team and I'm going to play against City, Arsenal, and I'm feeling, we can score goals, we can be dominant, we can control the game in certain moments.",
      "\"So, it's a feeling completely different from last year...\"",

      "Andre Onana's wife reunited with him in Turkey after his rocky period at Manchester United culminated with a season-long loan switch to Trabzonspor. Melanie Kamayou, married to the Cameroon international since 2023, was spotted earlier this month wheeling luggage trolleys at Manchester Airport after leaving their north west home.",
      "She is now settling into life in Trabzon, beginning a fresh journey alongside her husband after two difficult years in England both on and off the pitch. When United paid £47million to bring him from Inter Milan in 2023, the expectation was that they'd snagged a reliable presence between the posts.",
      "Instead, costly mistakes undermined Onana's reputation and his time at Old Trafford soon soured. He had slipped to third choice, sitting behind Altay Bayindir and late summer signing Senne Lammens.",
      "Trabzonspor then stepped in with a loan move, sweetened by a salary increase for the 29-year-old. The transfer offered Onana a fresh start - something most United supporters welcomed.",
      "Through all the turbulence, his wife Melanie has remained a steady presence. Far from the stereotypical football WAG, Melanie holds a doctorate in pharmacy.",
      "She also co-manages the Andre Onana Foundation, which delivers healthcare and education initiatives for disadvantaged African children. Alongside her professional expertise, she models and has gained more than 70,000 Instagram followers.",
      "Together since 2019, the pair tied the knot in Paris two years ago and share a young son. Melanie previously lived with Onana in Amsterdam during his Ajax spell, then followed him to Milan, Manchester, and now Turkey.",
      "Her loyalty has stretched through some of his lowest moments, including his doping ban in 2021. That year, after a positive test for furosemide, he served a nine-month suspension, explaining the mistake came from accidentally using Melanie's medication.",
      "Challenges, however, persisted in Manchester. Earlier this year, Melanie was robbed at knifepoint outside an Italian restaurant, losing luxury belongings including a Rolex and a £62,000 Hermes Birkin bag.",
      "Although the assailant was later caught, the ordeal, combined with Onana's struggles on the pitch and media scrutiny, cast a heavy shadow over their stay.",
      "The Black Sea city of Trabzon offers not just a change of scenery but a fervent fanbase eager to see Onana - who marked his second appearance for the club with an eye-catching assist - begin his redemption story.",
      "With Melanie at his side, he steps into this chapter ready to rebuild, supported by a partner whose strength and loyalty have never wavered.",

      "However, it seems he could be set to return to action today. In his pre-match press conference, Ruben Amorim confirmed that both Amad and Noussair Mazraoui would miss the game, but Dalot was back in the mix.",

      "Since the summer transfer window closed, Mainoo has continued to feature only sporadically, prompting numerous United supporters to question whether the Stockport-born playmaker will stay at Old Trafford beyond this season – or even January, particularly with next summer's World Cup approaching.",
      "\"He has had a taste of a tournament with England and came out of it with absolutely flying colours, and he will want a taste of that again, and rightly so. You have to have two hats in these situations.",
      "\"If you think about it being a player again, you have got to be thinking about yourself in these situations. You are lucky to go to multiple tournaments in your career, you are lucky to go to just one tournament.",
      "\"So, I understand that with my selfish, football player hat on, thinking about England and yourself. But, at the same time, if you are thinking long-term for Manchester United, I think Manchester United have to find a way of getting this kid in the team, he is a huge talent.",
      "\"Is there another way to get him in the team? What does he need to do? That is the big thing for me, as long as those conversations are going on.",
      "\"Has he asked those questions, or is he being told that this is what he needs to be doing? Is this a requirement? Work on this and then you will get an opportunity and then it is down to him.\"",
      "Amorim has been frank about how Mainoo is competing directly with Bruno Fernandes for a place in the side. Ferdinand reckons it shouldn't necessarily mean the young midfielder must wait for the skipper's departure before establishing himself in the first XI.",
      "\"I was a footballer once, and if I was in his situation, I would be impatient,\" Ferdinand continued. \"I am not looking to sit around.",

I was not in a position like Kobbie Mainoo, who has been to a tournament for England and playing really well and playing some big games for United, so I can understand his frustrations.",
      "\"For a young footballer, they want to play. Whatever is going on behind the scenes, I hope there is that transparency and communication as to why he is not playing and how he gets himself back in the team.\"",
      "While he can appreciate why Mainoo might be eager to secure a move for additional playing time, Ferdinand was crystal clear about where he believes the midfielder's future should lie.

      "Bruno Fernandes had the chance to make it 2-2 from the spot in the second half after Bryan Mbeumo was brought down in the area but his penalty was saved by Caoimhin Kelleher. Mathias Jensen scored late on to make it 3-1.",
      "Here are how United's players rated at the Gtech Community Stadium:",

      "Matthijs de Ligt",
      "Sloppy header moments after the restart nearly allowed Brentford through on goal, but made a vital tackle to clear the danger. 5",
      "Harry Maguire",
      "Culpable for Brentford's opener, allowing Thiago to get away from him and failing to track his run from an onside position. Solid aerially thereafter. 5",
      "Luke Shaw",
      "Found himself exposed on several occasions when Patrick Dorgu pushed forward, allowing Brentford to exploit the space left down the left side he was tasked with defending. 5",
      "Diogo Dalot",
      "Back in the starting line-up after missing United's previous two games through injury, he looked rusty, with Brentford's second goal coming down his side. Sloppy. 5",
      "Manuel Ugarte",
      "In for the suspended Casemiro and covered a lot of ground in the midfield, making several vital recovery tackles as Brentford dominated in the middle. 6",
      "Bruno Fernandes",
      "Quiet in terms of influence on the game but vocal in terms of barking instructions to his teammates. Needed to dig his side out of a hole but costly miss from the penalty spot. 5",
      "Patrick Dorgu",
      "Managed to get himself into plenty of dangerous positions down the left side, but was found wanting with his final ball, which has been a recurring theme since he joined United. 6",

      "Matheus Cunha",
      "Embarked on a surging run near the end of the first-half and chose to shoot, rather than passing to Fernandes, who was in a better position. Shot saved after the break. 6",

      "It turns out Ruben Amorim was right to say he had no idea which version of his Manchester United side would show up.",
      "Unfortunately for Amorim, the version that turned out at Brentford's Gtech Community Stadium was the one that continues to frustrate and infuriate him and United's fans.",
      "Every time this United team seems to have turned a corner, as they did with their hard-earned win over Chelsea the previous weekend, in which they showed hitherto unseen character and aggression, they somehow manage to regress and revert to type.",
      "Here, the seeds of their latest setback were sewn inside the first 20 minutes, Brentford striker Igor Thiago profiting from the uncertainty in United's defence to plunder two goals, the United boss left shaking his head at his team's continued failings.",
      "Where this leaves Amorim, only the United hierarchy know. There is an unwillingness to countenance the prospect that his position as head coach is under threat, after the United chief executive went all out to hire him and in so doing put his own reputation on the line.",
      "But those in charge at United cannot hide from the glaring truth that the team is simply not showing enough signs of progress under Amorim. Seven points from a possible 18 is simply not acceptable, after he was backed in the summer with £236million worth of new signings to strengthen his squad.",
      "After this defeat, Amorim now has just nine wins from 33 Premier League games. For all the talk from inside the club about an improved xG, fewer shots conceded, more shots on target and a significant upturn in the data, the only stats that matter are the results, which have been lamentable.",
      "Amoirm has still to win back-to-back Premier League games, despite being in charge for nearly a year, another shocking stat for the embattled head coach.",
      "A season without European football was supposed to be a blessing in disguise for United and Amorim, giving him free weeks to work with his players on his philosophy and system, but that argument has proved illusory, with the players just as unreliable and clueless as last season.",
      "Amorim made three changes from the side that secured a hard-earned 2-1 win over Chelsea a week earlier, Diogo Dalot, Manuel Ugarte and Matheus Cunha coming in for the injured Noussair Mazraoui, the suspended Casemiro and Amad, absent following a family bereavement.",
      "There was no first Premier League start of the season for Kobbie Mainoo, with Ugarte given the nod to replace Casemiro.",
      "United fell behind in the eighth minute, the defence having pushed up, allowing Jordan Henderson to pick out Thiago, who let the ball bounce once before thrashing a shot past Altay Bayindir, the ferocity of the shot giving the 'keeper no chance.",
      "Thiago notched his second of the game 12 minutes later. Brentford again exposed United's weakness down the right side, Bayindir palming away Kevin Schade's dangerous ball, only for Thaigo to steer it back over the line for the hosts to establish a 2-0 lead.",
      "United did not look like scoring, but £74m summer signing Benjamin Sesko gave them a lifeline in the 26th minute, scoring his first goal since his move from RB Leipzig with a fierce finish high into the net.",
      "Amorim's side failed to build any real momentum thereafter and never looked like scoring, but earned another lifeline in the 75th minute when Bryan Mbeumo – returning to his old club for the first time since his summer move - was brought down by Bees skipper Nathan Collins.",
      "Fernandes stepped up to take the resulting penalty – after a lengthy VAR check to see if the challenge from Collins warranted a red card – but failed from the spot with Caoimhin Kelleher saving his effort.",
      "Next up for United is Sunderland at home. Given how well the Black Cats have started on their return to the Premier League, that promises to be another unsettling afternoon at Old Trafford for Amorim and his under-performing players.",
      "If this wretched run carries on much longer, Amorim is likely to be put out of his misery and go the same was as his five predecessors, all of whom followed Sir Alex Ferguson and failed in what has now become the impossible job.",

      "Manchester United lost yet again in the Premier League as they were beaten 3-1 by Brentford on Saturday.",
      "United found themselves 2-0 down inside 20 minutes, with Igor Thiago scoring twice for Brentford. Benjamin Sesko scored his first United goal to give the Reds hope of a comeback.",
      "Bruno Fernandes had the chance to make it 2-2 from the spot in the second half after Bryan Mbeumo was brought down in the area but his penalty was saved by Caoimhin Kelleher. Mathias Jensen scored late on to make it 3-1.",
      "Stick with us for reaction from the Gtech Community Stadium.",
      "It turns out Ruben Amorim was right to say he had no idea which version of his Manchester United side would show up.",
      "Unfortunately for Amorim, the version that turned out at Brentford's Gtech Community Stadium was the one that continues to frustrate and infuriate him and United's fans.",
      "Every time this United team seems to have turned a corner, as they did with their hard-earned win over Chelsea the previous weekend, in which they showed hitherto unseen character and aggression, they somehow manage to regress and revert to type.",
      "Here, the seeds of their latest setback were sewn inside the first 20 minutes, Brentford striker Igor Thiago profiting from the uncertainty in United's defence to plunder two goals, the United boss left shaking his head at his team's continued failings.",
      "Where this leaves Amorim, only the United hierarchy know. There is an unwillingness to countenance the prospect that his position as head coach is under threat, after the United chief executive went all out to hire him and in so doing put his own reputation on the line.",
      "But those in charge at United cannot hide from the glaring truth that the team is simply not showing enough signs of progress under Amorim. Seven points from a possible 18 is simply not acceptable, after he was backed in the summer with £236million worth of new signings to strengthen his squad.",
      "Read the full report here.",
      "Altay Bayindir",
      "No chance with the opener but kept United in it with two fine first-half saves in succession. Did well to make the initial save moments before conceding the second. Beaten from range late on. 6",
      "Matthijs de Ligt",
      "Sloppy header moments after the restart nearly allowed Brentford through on goal, but made a vital tackle to clear the danger. 5",
      "Harry Maguire",
      "Culpable for Brentford's opener, allowing Thiago to get away from him and failing to track his run from an onside position. Solid aerially thereafter. 5",
      "Luke Shaw",
      "Found himself exposed on several occasions when Patrick Dorgu pushed forward, allowing Brentford to exploit the space left down the left side he was tasked with defending. 5",
      "Diogo Dalot",
      "Back in the starting line-up after missing United's previous two games through injury, he looked rusty, with Brentford's second goal coming down his side. Sloppy. 5",
      "Read the full ratings here.",
      "That's the final whistle here at the Gtech Community Stadium.",
      "Brentford counter-attack and make it 3-1 through Jensen.",
      "Eight minutes added here.",
      "Dorgu has been replaced by Zirkzee.",
      "Mount has replaced Shaw for the final 10 minutes.",
      "Fernandes' penalty is saved - that was a huge moment.",
      "Mbeumo is brought down and United have a penalty.",
      "I wanted Mainoo to start today because he's so much better on the ball than Ugarte.",
      "He's already been an improvement in the midfield",
      "Mainoo and Yoro ON.",
      "Ugarte and Maguire OFF.",
      "The 1,721 United fans who have made the trip to Brentford are getting frustrated by what they’re seeing and have made clear their feelings with a sustained chant of “Attack! Attack! Attack!”",
      "They have every right to demand more from their team, who have been meek and insipid going forward, failing to cause Brentford any problems, aside from Sesko’s first-half goal. There is no sense of United getting in behind Brentford’s defence and threatening their goal, and as it stands, the visitors are toothless in attack. Changes need to be made, with Mount and Zirkzee surely set to come on soon.",
      "Lovely ball in the box from Mbeumo, but Sesko can't connect and Dorgu failed to meet it at the back post.",
      "United have been poor on the ball today, which is why Amorim looks so stressed on the touchline.",
      "Dorgu just lost possession and Mbeumo waved his arms in frustration at the other side of the pitch.",
      "Here we go for the second half of the game in London.",
      "Here are your half-time ratings:",
      "Bayindir - exposed 6",
      "De Ligt - uncertain 5",
      "Maguire - hesitant 4",
      "Shaw - sloppy 4",
      "Dalot - erratic 5",
      "Ugarte - busy 6",
      "Fernandes - quiet 5",
      "Dorgu - determined 6",
      "Mbeumo - peripheral 5",
      "Sesko - clinical 6",
      "Cunha - industrious 6",
      "That's the whistle for the break here.",
      "Brentford are leading at the Gtech.",
      "Dorgu just told Bayindir to calm down and take his time on the ball.",
      "Brentford fans just heckled Shaw for sending a long ball into the stands instead of finding Fernandes.",
      "Although United have not made the start they wanted, it's an entertaining game. The early-kick off slot can often produce slow contests, but there's a good pace to it and there has been chances at both ends.",
      "Sesko hardly celebrated and Amorim gestured his players to rush back for the restart - game on.",
      "Sesko has his first goal for United, although VAR are checking the goal for a foul in the build-up.",
      "United are undone once again, conceding a sloppy second, with the home fans singing “Bryan, what’s the score?” to their former forward Mbeumo, who left them for United in the summer. Amorim’s defence found themselves on the back foot again, Bayindir palming away Schade’s cross and very nearly kept out the rebound, which was turned in by Thiago, for his second of the game. It’s a long way back for the Reds from here.",
      "This could be a repeat of the embarrassing defeat 4-0 in August 2022. Brentford lost to Fulham last weekend, and this was a huge chance to build momentum after Chelsea. United have made a shocking start and have given themselves a mountain to climb in London.",
      "Thiago scores again for Brentford, who have been the dominant side in the opening exchanges.",
      "Bayindir made a save, but Thiago was there to tap in the rebound to make it 2-0.",
      "Cunha is becoming unhappy with Sesko, who picked the wrong pass just there.",
      "He had another word with him when the ball went out of play.",
      "Cunha comes close to producing an immediate response, just shooting wide of the post. United need to get him on the ball because he is bound to make something happen.",
      "Amorim is clearly not happy with how deep his United team are sitting, shaking his head and imploring them to push up.",
      "Moments later, United are caught cold, a long ball from Jordan Henderson met by Igor Thiago, who lets it bounce before thrashing it past Bayindir. United’s defence were convinced Thiago was offside, but after a VAR check, the goal stands and Brentford lead 1-0.",
      "That's a horrible goal to concede. It was far too simple to launch that ball forward to Thiago. Maguire was left isolated. Amorim did not look pleased before the goal, and certainly won't be happy now."

      "Manchester United lost 3-1 against Brentford in the Premier League on Saturday afternoon.",
      "Brentford made an excellent start to the game, taking a two-goal lead within 20 minutes after a brace from Igor Thiago, giving United a mountain to climb at the Gtech Community Stadium.",
      "Benjamin Sesko scored his first goal for the club to halve the deficit before the interval. United had a golden chance to draw level when Bryan Mbeumo won a penalty with 15 minutes remaining, but Bruno Fernandes' low effort was saved by Brentford goalkeeper Caoimhin Kelleher.",
      "Brentford wrapped up the victory with an injury-time goal from Mathias Jensen.",
      "Here are the talking points and moments you might have missed:",
      "The system is a problem",
      "Brentford opened the scoring far too easily, launching a long ball forward after stifling an attack from United. Harry Maguire was isolated and Thiago lashed the ball beyond Altay Bayindir.",
      "It was concerning that Brentford were able to bypass United's entire team with a simple long ball. There had been instances of the team looking disjointed before that breakthrough, with a large gap between the backline and attack, so the manner of Brentford's goal wasn't surprising.",
      "Ruben Amorim finally had a chance to address the problem when Sesko halved the deficit, which allowed him to usher Maguire and Luke Shaw to the touchline to receive tactical instructions.",
      "United's head coach should not need to address the space between the backline, midfield and attack at this stage of his tenure. That should be second nature to his players.",
      "The problem is part of the ongoing conversation around Amorim's system and the debate about whether he will succeed at Old Trafford with his approach. He is still yet to win back-to-back league games.",
      "The chant from United's fans",
      "The tempo dropped after play resumed for the second half and there was a worrying lack of urgency from United, who were trailing by a goal and supposed to be trying to find a way back into the game.",
      "\"Attack, attack, attack,\" pleaded the travelling away support. It all looked far too pedestrian, despite Amorim trying to gee up his players from the sidelines.",
      "There was hope United would build on their Chelsea victory but it's another false dawn.",
      "The reception for Mainoo",
      "There was a loud cheer when Kobbie Mainoo was introduced to the game in the 66th minute. Many wondered whether Mainoo would be given his first start of the Premier League season against Brentford, but Manuel Ugarte was selected to start alongside Fernandes instead.",
      "Ugarte was wasteful, losing possession far too often. The 24-year-old is not having a good season and the reaction to Mainoo's introduction hinted United fans think he should be involved more often.",
      "It didn't take long for Mainoo to offer what Ugarte did not. The youngster escaped a tight space with the ball at his feet, and impressively broke up a Brentford attack moments later.",
      "Amorim's handling of Mainoo has been questionable this season.",
      "Cunha showed his frustration",
      "It didn't take long for Cunha to become frustrated with how the game was unfolding. He tried to encourage his teammates as they prepared for the restart following Thiago's opener and became animated with Sesko when he picked the wrong pass, which botched a sweeping move forward.",
      "Cunha had further words with Sesko when the ball went out of play for a throw-in. The Brazilian isn't afraid to dish out orders to his teammates and Amorim has praised that part of his character.",
      "However, it works both ways, and Cunha can make wrong decisions on the ball himself, just like when he chose to shoot from the edge of the box instead of sliding Fernandes through.",
      "Cunha, Sesko and Mbeumo started together for the first time against Brentford and there were teething problems.",
      "Mbeumo reunion",
      "Mbeumo returned to the Gtech Community Stadium for the first time since signing for United for £65m in the summer. The forward spent six successful years with Brentford and left on good terms.",
      "Before the warm-ups began, Mbeumo chatted with his former teammates on the pitch and seemed in good spirits. He shared an embrace with a handful of his former colleagues, and Brentford's supporters gave Mbeumo a loud cheer when the stadium announcer read out his name.",
      "Mbeumo scored in Brentford's 4-0 hammering of United in August 2022 when Erik ten Hag was in charge, and memories of that game came flooding back as the Bees took a 2-0 lead within 20 minutes.",
      "The Cameroon international played a brilliant cross into the box in the second half, but nobody was there to connect with it. Mbeumo didn't have that problem during his stint with Brentford.",
      "\"Bryan, what's the score?\" sang Brentford's fans at the end of the game.",

      "Manchester United and Ruben Amorim's 3-1 defeat to Brentford was dubbed \"a joke\" by Usain Bolt, and exiled defender Tyrell Malacia also sent the Red Devils' head coach a telling message.",
      "Amorim's side endured their third defeat of the current Premier League campaign on Saturday when they made the trip to the Gtech Community Stadium. Bees forward Igor Thiago netted a first-half brace before Benjamin Sesko reduced the deficit, and despite United being awarded a spot-kick on 76 minutes, Bruno Fernandes was unable to find the net.",
      "Brentford claimed a third strike to confirm United's downfall deep into stoppage time, and during a disastrous opening period, one of the club's most prominent supporters, 100m and 200m world record holder Bolt, labelled the display a \"joke.\"",
      "Meanwhile, ostracised left-back Malacia has delivered a statement to his boss through his training efforts, and Rio Ferdinand has cautioned the head coach that one player needs to be restored to the first team.",
      "Brentford's opener on Saturday saw Harry Maguire keep striker Thiago onside before he found the net beyond Altay Bayindir after merely nine minutes. Fewer than 10 minutes later, and it was 2-0, the Brazilian claiming his second as United's keeper pushed a delivery into his path.",
      "This catastrophic opening 20 minutes left some supporters furious, and even Bolt felt compelled to express his disappointment. He turned to social media and wrote on X: \"This must be a joke.\"",
      "Supporters in the comments section of this post shared similar frustrations, with one stating: \"United are a joke. Have been for a decade.\" Another commented: \"Even Bolt cannot believe how useless this club is.\"",
      "Despite Sesko netting his maiden goal for the visitors to reduce the deficit, Amorim's team suffered another setback. The Portuguese manager has still not managed to secure back-to-back Premier League victories since taking charge of the Red Devils.",
      "Beyond the Brentford encounter, outcast Malacia has demonstrated to prospective clubs and Amorim that he remains match-ready. Missing out on a transfer this summer represented another setback for the Netherlands international, who has endured a challenging period in Manchester following his arrival under Erik ten Hag.",
      "Despite joining as a potential first-choice full-back, Malacia has struggled for playing time. A knee problem in 2023 kept him out for more than 500 days, which certainly didn't aid his situation.",
      "Potential switches to Spanish side Elche and Turkish clubs failed to materialise during the summer window, following his loan spell at PSV in the latter half of last campaign. Currently, Malacia finds himself marginalised, unsuited to Amorim's wing-back system.",
      "Nevertheless, the 26-year-old has signalled his readiness to return to action, sharing Instagram footage of himself training at Shawe View, the home of nearby non-league outfit Trafford FC. He has demonstrated to both Amorim and managers at clubs potentially interested in a January move that he is maintaining his fitness levels.",
      "Kobbie Mainoo was brought on after 66 minutes against Brentford, and whilst he struggled to leave a significant mark, he has demonstrated flashes of potential in recent weeks. Amorim persists with Manuel Ugarte at the heart of his midfield setup in the suspended Casemiro's absence, though.",
      "Red Devils legend Ferdinand believes the manager must do everything possible to secure Mainoo additional playing time. Speaking exclusively to the MEN as he fronts Talking Futures' new initiative Half Time Talks, Ferdinand said: \"If he was agitating to get a loan now, if he is not playing in January, he will be agitating and knocking the door down even more to go and get game time.",
      "\"You have to have two hats in these situations. If you think about it, being a player again, you have got to be thinking about yourself in these situations. You are lucky to go to multiple tournaments in your career, you are lucky to go to just one tournament, so I understand that with my selfish, football player hat on, thinking about England and yourself.",
      "\"But, at the same time, if you are thinking long-term for Manchester United, I think Manchester United have to find a way of getting this kid in the team, he is a huge talent.\"",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "American referee David Gerson believes Brentford should have finished the game with 10 men as Manchester United fell to a 3-1 defeat at the G-Tech Community Stadium.",
      "Brentford defender Nathan Collins was fortunate to avoid a red card after committing a foul on Bryan Mbeumo in the second half. The former Wolves man dragged down his former colleague inside the penalty area.",
      "Referee Craig Pawson showed Collins a yellow card and Video Assistant Referee Andy Madley, alongside his assistant Nicholas Hopton, examined the incident at Stockley Park, deemed it not to be a sending off offence.",
      "Bruno Fernandes eventually stepped up to take the spot kick, with the score 2-1 to Brentford at the time, but his effort was saved.",
      "Explaining the decision, the Premier League Match Centre wrote on X: \"The referee's call of penalty was checked and confirmed by VAR – with Collins deemed to pulled Mbeumo back. VAR also checked the referee’s call of yellow card to Collins - and deemed that Mbeumo wasn't in control of the ball.\"",
      "However, Gerson, who took to Instagram to discuss the decision, disagreed with the Premier League. \"This is absolutely a red card for denial of obvious goalscoring opportunity,\" he said.",
      "\"How this was only a yellow card and penalty, I don't understand. Let me go ahead and dispel some myths, double jeopardy, you can't give a red card in a penalty kick. Absolutely, you can. The laws have changed over the years, it used to be the case you couldn't, now you can.",
      "\"The second thing, what are DOGSO (Denial of Goal Scoring Opportunity) conditions, so distance, absolutely met, number of defenders, there's no one between the foul and the goal, and then you got direction, he's right in the middle of the field, he's going towards goal and then, likely to control.",
      "\"That's right, you don't need to have control of the ball for it to be a red card, for DOGSO opportunity. This ball has not come across him yet and he's being pulled back so the foul has occurred, he's being pulled away from the ball, he absolutely has likely hood of control - a slow rolling ball for a Premier League or running onto the ball, that is absolute likelihood of control.",
      "\"So the correct decision should be a red card and a penalty kick. How they did not award this, I don't understand because it makes a difference, right. We got 15 minutes left in the game, player gets sent off and obviously they missed the penalty kick, but still, now you're playing 11 vs 10 men.",
      "\"I am really interested to hear PGMOL's explanation of this one.\"",
      "United suffered their third defeat in the league this season, prompting further questions over Ruben Amorim's future.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Matheus Cunha has not held back when assessing Manchester United's performance against Brentford in the Premier League on Saturday. Goals from Igor Thiago (x2) and substitute Mathias Jensen sealed a victory for the Bees, with Benjamin Sesko's first goal for United merely a consolation in the end.",
      "Ruben Amorim's side found themselves two goals behind at the Gtech Community Stadium after 20 minutes with Thiago causing all sorts of problems.",
      "Sesko brought United back into the game just before the interval from close-range at the third time of asking to open his account.",
      "Bruno Fernandes had the chance to equalise from the penalty spot midway through the second half when Nathan Collins fouled Bryan Mbeumo, but his tame effort was saved by Caoimhin Kelleher. Brentford held firm for the remainder and grabbed a third in stoppage time when Jensen fired in a superb effort that flew past Altay Bayindir.",
      "A third defeat from six league games sees United remain in the bottom half of the table with last weekend's win over Chelsea only lightly relieving pressure on Amorim",

      "Hello and welcome to the Manchester United transfer blog on Saturday, September 27.",
      "We have a busy day ahead which starts nice and early as the Reds travel to Brentford in the early kick-off in the Premier League. Ruben Amorim will be hoping that his team will be able to build on the momentum created by the 2-1 victory over Chelsea last time out.",
      "There will be a focus on transfers here today. Bayern Munich striker Harry Kane remains in the headlines and he has spoken about a possible return to the Premier League.",
      "Meanwhile, there is talk that Crystal Palace's Adam Wharton is on the radar for United too. All eyes will be on Kobbie Mainoo this afternoon as speculation around his future continues.",
      "Take a look back at the United transfer news from this morning below...",
      "Thank you for joining the United blog this morning.",
      "We are now going to hand over to our colleagues at the Gtech Community Stadium as they build-up to the clash with Brentford.",
      "You can follow the match here.",
      "Ahead of today's clash with Brentford, Alan Shearer has insisted that he is yet to be convinced by United despite the victory over Chelsea last weekend.",
      "Making his prediction for today's game with Betfair, the Newcastle legend said:",
      "I'm still not convinced that all is well at Man United even though confidence should be sky high. Brentford will be tough for them, so I'll go for a draw.",
      "The Reds received good news this week in their bid to bring Adam Wharton to Old Trafford in the future.",
      "According to talkSPORT journalist Ben Jacobs, speaking on The United Stand, Wharton has a gentleman's agreement in place to leave Palace at the end of the season.",
      "If this is the case, United may hope to sign the former Blackburn man for less than the £100m+ price tag that is currently on Carlos Baleba.",
      "German publication Bild understands that United could sign Kane for a bargain £56.7m fee in the summer transfer window.",
      "However, this will only be the case should Kane inform Bayern, before the end of the January transfer window, that he wishes to leave.",
      "It is also believed that Spurs would be given the opportunity to match any fee that is proposed for Kane so United would have a few hoops to jump through to get the deal done.",
      "After becoming the fastest player in the top five European leagues to 100 goals on Friday night, Kane was asked about returning to the Premier League.",
      "He responded:",
      "I’m really happy here at Bayern. I have two years left on my contract. And to be honest, I’m enjoying every minute. I enjoy playing here in front of the fans. I enjoy the team, the coach. So that’s not on my mind at all. I’m just looking forward to this season and hope we’ll be successful.",
      "Hello and welcome back to the United transfer blog this Saturday morning.",
      "It is matchday in the Premier League for the Reds as they travel to Brentford this lunchtime.",
      "While we will be bringing you big match build-up lines, we shall be focusing mainly on transfers including what this man has said about a return to England...",
      "Manchester United will be without several members of their squad for the clash against Brentford.",
      "Amad, who will not feature after being granted compassionate leave after suffering a family bereavement.",
      "\"Amad is not here, someone in his family passed away and we are giving all the support to him,\" he said.",
      "\"For Amad, we are here for him, it's a tough moment. In these kind of moments it's not the most important thing [football]. We can win without Amad, but also we want to win for Amad.\"",
      "Noussair Mazraoui and Lisandro Martinez are both sidelined through injury. Casemiro will serve a one-game suspension for the red card he picked up in the win over Chelsea.",
      "Former Denmark international Mikkel Beckmann believes a move away from Manchester United may be an option for highly-rated forward Chido Obi.",
      "He told Viaplay: \"The reserve team matches… it doesn’t taste particularly good. It’s like when we have our Future Cup matches at home. It’s the reserves who play, and it’s just far from the same as playing first-team football,” he said.",
      "\"I just don’t think the time is right for Amorim to suddenly try Chido Obi out at United.",
      "“He is very, very far from the first team at United. I would like to see him play some senior football at a higher level than just reserves at United.”",
      "Chido Obi was in and around the first-team pictures last season under Ruben Amorim but has largely remained with the under-21s this season after an influx of attackers.",
      "Marcus Rashford grabbed another goal contribution for Barcelona in the 3-1 La Liga win over Real Oviedo on Thursday evening.",
      "The England international was back in the starting XI after being benched for their last encounter for being slightly late to training. That arrived just a few days on from his stunning brace in the Champions League against Newcastle.",
      "Manchester United midfielder Kobbie Mainoo has issued an update to Instagram.",
      "The 20-year-old, who wanted to leave the club on loan this past summer, has been a trending topic in recent weeks with his future seeming uncertain. However, MEN Sport have since revealed that he is working hard at Carrington to impress Ruben Amorim having also hired a new private chef.",
      "The latest update has come on his Instagram story with Mainoo reposting an update from Leny Yoro that shows the duo together in a number of photos. Mainoo is also in the replies of the French defender's post.",
      "A post shared by YL15 (@lenyyoro)",
      "Ruben Amorim has confirmed that Amad and Noussair Mazraoui will both miss Manchester United's trip to Brentford in the Premier League.",
      "\"Licha [Lisandro Martinez} is out. Casemiro is out because of the red card. Amad is not here because someone in his family passed away. We are giving all the support to Amad and understood he needed to return home,\" he said.",
      "Diogo Dalot is in line to replace Amad with the Portugal international returning to training on Thursday. Mazraoui meanwhile, has been ruled out.",
      "\"He [Mazraoui] is out also. He will not be back until the international break,\" Amorim revealed.",
      "Manchester United have been linked with moves for Adam Wharton and Carlos Baleba of Crystal Palace and Brighton, respectively.",
      "When speaking on the United Stand, journalist Ben Jacobs has provided a verdict on interest in both.",
      "At the moment I'm not really aware of Liverpool making a particular push for a deeper-lying midfielder if anything, should Liverpool add, it might be more of an attacking midfielder.",
      "With the likes of Wharton and Baleba, we know that they're going to be in demand. With Carls Baleba, there's going to be two aspects.",
      "One is naturally the market pushing towards trying to sign him with multiple suitors, and Manchester United fans shouldn't be surprised by that.",
      "The second aspect is obviously price, and even though many may feel £100m is a lot of money and something that could get a deal done, Brighton's data and Brighton's approach is to think this is a player that might be a Moisés Caicedo-type fee, £150m or more in 12 months' time.",
      "I think there is a strong possibility that two come in. I don't see a January sale for Carlos Baleba. The slow start to the season has maybe been influenced by some of the summer speculation.",
      "There's other names that could be available mid season if Manchester United have the funds from potentially a Kobbie Mainoo exit, we'll have to wait and see what transpires.",
      "Manchester United could face competition for the signature of Carlos Baleba if they opt to actively pursue his services next summer.",
      "Interest in the Brighton star was made clear towards the latter stages of the most recent trading period and now SportsBoom are claiming that Spurs have joined the race for Baleba but that he still would prefer a move to Old Trafford.",
      "Alternatives for United include Nottingham Forest star Elliot Anderson and Crystal Palace's Adam Wharton.",
      "Hello and welcome to the Manchester United news and transfers live blog brought to you by MEN Sport.",
      "Transfer rumours have continued to circulate around Old Trafford with a move for a marquee midfielder expected. Crystal Palace's Adam Wharton features very high on the club's shortlist.",
      "There is also plenty to look at regarding the futures of Marcus Rashford and Kobbie Mainoo following very different weeks for the two United academy graduates.",
      "To also learn of the latest updates ahead of the trip to Brentford!",
      "Further to the update surrounding Baleba, Jacobs gave United a boost in their hopes to sign Wharton in the summer.",
      "The journalist believes that Wharton has a gentleman's agreement with Palace to leave the club at the end of this season.",
      "Should this be the case, it would be a shock if United do not try and pursue a move for the ex-Blackburn Rovers man.",
      "Some nerves have been jangled recently after reports emerged suggesting that Liverpool were willing to challenge United to sign Carlos Baleba next summer.",
      "However, journalist Ben Jacobs understands this is not the case.",
      "Talking to The United Stand, Jacobs claimed that Liverpool are not looking at the possibility of adding a deeper midfielder due to the ongoing success of Ryan Gravenberch.",
      "Panic soon began to spread after Obi was dropped to the bench to face Athletic Club especially after he made a promising breakthrough into the first team squad last season.",
      "But speaking recently to the MEN, academy head coach Travis Binnion urged fans to be patient with the striker and his development.",
      "It's not easy for him because people look at him like he's a big kid. The key thing there is he's still very young, he's still learning his game. Because he's had exposure with the first-team, I think people expect performance levels that are really consistent and really high. You've got first-team players across the country who don't do that. The expectation on him is high, but he has to deliver the basics, and what he did from minute 30 to 80 when he came off is he pressed, he ran and he occupied two centre halves to give other players space on the pitch to exploit, which is why we dominated the ball. They [City] will say they are not scared of him, but they defended two versus one against him all day. I'm pleased he got his goal because you can toil up there, not touch it, not do a lot, but he got his goal and set us on our way. I'm really pleased with him and we haven't even scraped the top of the iceberg with him. He's got loads to come.",
      "MEN Sport understands that Obi was rested against Athletic Bilbao this week for the U21s.",
      "The striker seemed disappointed as he was named on the bench for the contest against the Basque club in the Premier League International Cup.",
      "However, it is understood the decision was made to rest him due to United's U21s having a busy schedule.",
      "READ MORE HERE",
      "Hello and welcome back to the United transfer blog.",
      "Jack Flintham here to take you through the next couple of hours of United news.",
      "We are going to start by taking a look at this young man and what is happening with his development.",
      "Jadon Sancho helped Aston Villa get their European campaign off to the perfect start as they beat Bologna.",
      "The on-loan Manchester United man came on as a substitute on the 58th-minute mark as he replaced Emi Buendia.",
      "Villa eventually won 1-0 thanks to John McGinn's strike.",
      "Former Premier League star Gabby Agbonlahor has been baffled by United's approach to Casemiro and Harry Maguire's futures.",
      "talkSPORT host Alan Brazil said: “Man United, they’re talking about players that are out of favour and who’s staying. It looks like they might let Harry (Maguire) go but keep Casemiro and I don’t get that,” Brazil said.",
      "“That’s very odd,” Agbonlahor replied.",
      "“Harry Maguire played on the weekend. Harry Maguire for me, he played on the weekend against Chelsea. He’s their best centre-half. I don’t understand that.”",
      "Manchester United are set to sign Charlie Hardy.",
      "And he has since spoken out on the move. He said: “After almost a decade at Derby County, the time has now come for a new chapter.\"",
      "Man United winger Amad has named his three best moments playing alongside Bruno Fernandes.",
      "He said: \"The hat-trick against Real Sociedad, the goal against Liverpool at home, so many great moments.",
      "\"But if I had to pick one, I would say maybe lifting a trophy [FA Cup in 2024] is very special for him.”",
      "Some news from one of Man United's Premier League rivals now. Aston Villa are set to take on Italian side Bologna in their Europa League opener this evening.",
      "On-loan Red Devils star Jadon Sancho has had to make do with a place on the bench for the game.",
      "Elsewhere, Marcus Rashford has been named in Barcelona's starting XI for their La Liga showdown against Real Oviedo tonight. He is still without a league goal since joining the Catalans.",
      "Liverpool are reportedly rivalling United for Gleison Bremer.",
      "Tutto Juve claims that Juventus are aware of transfer interest from both clubs. However, the Turin club are said to have made it known informally that they do not intend to sell the Brazilian, considering the defender a cornerstone of their team.",
      "Steven Railston reports that United are set to sign teenage goalkeeper Charlie Hardy from Derby County.",
      "Hardy will sign scholarship terms at United after receiving Premier League ratification to join. The expectation is for Hardy, who is 16 years old, to play for United's under-18s, who former midfielder Darren Fletcher coaches.",
      "Adam Wharton is said to have a gentleman's agreement with Crystal Palace to leave the club next summer.",
      "The journalist Ben Jacobs, via The United Stand, claims the situation will clearly be one to watch. United are one of multiple Premier League clubs credited with an interest in the England international central midfielder.",
      "United were reportedly willing to sign Eintracht Frankfurt goalkeeper Kaua Santos before eventually bringing in Senne Lammens.",
      "BILD claims United came knocking towards the end of the transfer window, but had an offer blocked by the Bundesliga club and Santos himself. United were reputedly willing to pay them around £22-£26million.",
      "The reported United transfer target Lucien Agoume is said to be someone Arsenal will likely be monitoring as well.",

      "Brexit rules mean Manchester United's academy recruitment is limited to the United Kingdom. English clubs cannot sign talented teenagers from Europe under the age of 18.",
      "That means United must wait until a player from Europe celebrates their 18th birthday to act on their interest. However, players are usually tied down and more difficult to sign by that stage of their career.",
      "United still operate in the European market when opportunities arise and were proactive in wrapping up the signing of Enzo Kana-Biyik on a free transfer from Le Havre this summer.",
      "Since Ineos invested in the club, there has been increased activity in markets outside of Europe. Sekou Kone was signed from Mali in 2024, Diego Leon arrived from Paraguay this summer and United have struck a preliminary agreement to sign Colombian teenager Cristian Orozco.",
      "The defensive midfielder plays for Fortaleza CEIF, has captained Colombia's Under-17 team and helped his nation reach the final of the U17 South American Championship in the spring.",
      "United have identified Orozco as an exciting young talent with potential to progress to the first-team. However, Orozco will not be able to complete a move to Old Trafford until he turns 18 next year, so he will continue to play for Fortaleza CEIF until the transfer can be finalised in July.",
      "The same approach was taken with Leon. In January, United agreed a £3.3million fee, rising to £7m with add-ons, to sign Leon and he continued to play in Paraguay until relocating to Manchester this summer.",
      "Kone was signed for around £1m from Mali club Guidars FC. He was first scouted by United in November 2023 at the Under-17 World Cup in Indonesia. Multiple staff members watched Kone throughout that tournament as Mali beat Argentina to claim a third-place finish.",
      "Having followed Kone at the U17 World Cup, another United scout attended an Under-18 tournament in Morocco in April 2024 where Kone featured as one of the players of the tournament. It's understood the recommendation to sign Kone came after this tournament.",
      "The likelihood is that Orozco was tracked by United at the U17 South American Championship. Scouts were impressed by Kone's displays for Mali and Orozco has shown great potential with Colombia.",
      "Orozco will arrive in Manchester with a similar profile to Kone: young, raw and possessing huge potential. These kinds of transfers are essentially low risk and high reward for United.",
      "The best-case scenario is that a signing breaks into the first team and establishes himself in the Premier League. The worst-case scenario is that he is below first-team standard but is still sold for a profit.",
      "United are planning for the future and trying to explore markets further afield more often. Other Premier League clubs have made more use of non-European markets and have landed some gems.",
      "Brighton have been the standard-setting team in the league for recruitment for some time now, and the Seagulls' data-driven approach has unearthed some wonderfully gifted players.",
      "United wanted to sign Moises Caicedo in December 2020, but the £5.5m asking price was too steep. Brighton agreed a deal and sold Caicedo to Chelsea just two-and-a-half years later for £115m.",
      "Ineos' decision-makers will be praised if Kone, Leon or Orozco can develop their games like Caicedo did. The only downside is they need time and patience to grow, which is something rarely afforded at United.",
      "Jason Wilcox is hugely influential behind the scenes and different sources have indicated he was already doing the director of football job before he was officially given the title.",
      "In February, United appointed Christopher Vivell as director of recruitment on a full-time basis following his interim spell in the role and he became a regular attendee of academy games.",
      "The role of Matt Hargreaves as director of football negotiations should also be noted. Hargreaves has a large responsibility for transfers and contracts at Old Trafford, and is known to be an excellent operator.",
      "Representatives have spoken glowingly about Hargreaves and have praised his understanding of players, the football business and negotiations, so he is seen as a valuable member of staff.",

      "Manchester United legend Rio Ferdinand is fronting a new campaign this weekend to help end the stigma around parents discussing careers with their children.",
      "Ahead of this weekend's Premier League action, Ferdinand has partnered with Talking Futures to launch Half Time Talks. The idea is for parents to sit down with their children during the 15-minute break to discuss more than just tactics but also their plans for their future careers.",
      "Ferdinand, alongside Talking Futures, have created online resources to help prep parents for what is arguably one of the toughest conversations they can have with their teenagers. When asked why he chose to front this new initiative, the former United Premier League and Champions League winner explained how he wanted to end the panic that sets in when talking about jobs.",
      "\"I just thought that I am in the sweet spot of people who need this type of information,\" he explained in an exclusive interview with MEN Sport. \"I have got three teenage kids, two boys and a girl.",
      "\"My two boys have made their mind up and want to be footballers, but my daughter is 14 and she is having a panic attack every time we mention careers because she does not know what she wants to do. We are saying to her, most kids your age haven’t normally got a clue what they want to do.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "\"If they have got their eye on something right now, it doesn’t always end up being that job that they go in. It is very, very fortunate if that’s the case.",
      "\"I think this initiative kind of helps parents talk to their children through football. At half-time, that is when you have got your kids engaged.",
      "\"That’s when parents have got that connection with their kids and it is at that time to broach the conversation about careers which is normally a difficult conversation for parents to have with their kids.\" At the Premier League matches this weekend, leaflets will be handed out about the Half Time Talk and further information will also be available for parents in the matchday programmes.",
      "And it is a lack of information which Ferdinand believes can only end up driving anxiety in the subject. \"You need the information at your fingertips to go and execute [a career] and not knowing creates panic and anxiety within families,\" he added.",
      "\"As a parent, you want to help your kids and give them the opportunities and that’s why I think it is important for families to watch the film that we have done - there are loads of tips and resources in there - to put you in the best position to help them get their hands on a good job that they can get up everyday and feel passionate about.\"",

      "Chido Obi was rested for Manchester United Under-21s' game against Athletic Bilbao on Wednesday.",
      "Travis Binnion named Obi on the bench for the opening Premier League International Cup game. The U21s have a busy schedule this month and the decision was made to give Obi a rest.",
      "Obi played the full 90 minutes in a league victory against Liverpool last Sunday. The U21s were still able to claim a 2-1 win against Bilbao to get their PL International Cup campaign off to a flying start at Old Trafford.",
      "Bilbao were leading 1-0 and were comfortable until Binnion made four changes on the hour mark.",
      "Shea Lacey, Amir Ibragimov, Finley McAllister and Gabriele Biancheri were introduced for Jayce Fitzgerald, Jim Thwaites, Victor Musa and Reece Munro, and the changes had the desired effect.",
      "Biancheri provided an assist for James Scanlon and scored a late match-winner in added time.",
      "\"Because he's had exposure with the first-team, I think people expect performance levels that are really consistent and really high. You've got first-team players across the country who don't do that.",
      "\"The expectation on him is high, but he has to deliver the basics, and what he did from minute 30 to 80 when he came off is he pressed, he ran and he occupied two centre halves to give other players space on the pitch to exploit, which is why we dominated the ball.",
      "\"They [City] will say they are not scared of him, but they defended two versus one against him all day. I'm pleased he got his goal because you can toil up there, not touch it, not do a lot, but he got his goal and set us on our way. I'm really pleased with him and we haven't even scraped the top of the iceberg with him. He's got loads to come.",
      "\"That will come from how he sees the game, keeps working hard and recognises he has stuff to develop because that's always a challenge when you have that first-team exposure and then you go away and have to start working on things.\"",
      "Obi must continue to work hard to earn first-team involvement. \"When you score as many goals as he has throughout his relatively short life, you can define yourself by goals,\" said Binnion.",
      "\"And we all know there's probably only two or three strikers in the world who get two goals in every three games. If you're used to scoring two goals in every game, then recognising what the role is, how you have to go around it takes a little bit of time. He is dying to be a footballer.",
      "\"He is hungry. And he's still learning the game, learning how to project himself and learning how to play within a team, the club's shape and system, so there's still lots for him to do.",
      "\"The key is he wants to play, he wants to do well and wants to train. He could train every day if he could.\"",

      "\"He doesn't get upset when corrected; it's a pleasure to coach him. I was very happy when I found out he could go to Manchester United.\"",
      "Campo Elías Santacruz added: “With his character and playing style, he established himself in the U15 and U17 teams. Despite being so young, he always showed leadership in practice.",
      "\"He trained hard and, on and off the field, acted like a young man with experience. His teammates helped him grow, and today we can say he's a great human being.\"",
      "United have widened their academy recruitment in recent years due to Brexit rules, which prevent them from signing players from Europe.",
      "In January, United agreed a £3.3million fee, rising to £7m with add-ons, with Cerro Porteno to sign Diego Leon. The deal also outlined Leon would complete his move from Paraguay in the summer window.",

      "United insider for The Athletic, Whitwell, called out VAR for its role in the United loss, but felt the result was deserved.",
      "He wrote on X: ‘Atrocious use of VAR. Clear red card for denial of goal-scoring opportunity, no effort to play the ball by [Nathan] Collins, yet four minutes wasted only for officials to avoid making the decision. Then subs. Poor penalty Fernandes, who has shown he can be affected by delays.’",
      "Indeed, Fernandes had missed a penalty in August after colliding with the referee as he stepped back to take a spot kick, and this time around, after a long delay, he placed it along the ground and not in the corner, comfortable for Caoimhin Kelleher to save.",

Painful watching them. United deserved to lose. But Brentford should be taking the headlines.’",

You can’t even blame the keeper this time, though for I don’t think he was faultless for any of the goals. I saw nothing from United. Only really Dorgu and Sesko offered any sense that they had turned up today, though there was little quality from United altogether.",

      "United put on another below-par performance, with Amorim still struggling to put his stamp on things. So far this season in the Premier League, the Red Devils have had the best xG of any club.",
      "And they were again positive on the front foot against Brentford, with more shots and more of the ball, yet they lost 3-1.",
      "Former Premier League defender Richards feels that’s the fault of Amorim, as while two players were called out for their roles in Brentford goals, it all boils down to the system not suiting them.",
      "Richards said: “Shambolic! I still think the system is hampering them. They’re not sure where they’re meant to be. In terms of the goals though, there were individual errors. Harry Maguire trying to play offside for the first one – there’s no point gambling there.",
      "“Then, for the second goal, [Matthijs] de Ligt doesn’t know where he’s going and then Maguire isn’t sure where to position himself. It’s 100 per cent confusion caused by playing that system – it doesn’t suit the players there.”",
      "Indeed, the camera operators couldn’t even catch up for the first goal, as a long ball was sprayed from nowhere after United lost possession, only for the broadcast to pick up Maguire chasing down Igor Thiago – to no avail as he slotted in the top corner.",
      "For the second goal, De Ligt followed a ball dropping behind the United defence, but changed his run to focus on the attacker the ball was going to land with, getting there too late, so a shot could come in, and the rebound was scored.",
      "Altay Bayindir was unable to save the rebound despite getting a hand to it, and might have proven Peter Crouch right in the process.",
      "Prior to the game, Crouch said: “It feels to me, the situation with the goalkeeper just hasn’t been addressed. I think it feels like they’ve got three No.2s. It’s an issue that was obvious, [Andre] Onana wasn’t going to be the No.1. I think we knew that. And I don’t think the situation’s been addressed.”",
      "Indeed, summer signing Senne Lammens can’t get a game between the sticks, but given Bayindir isn’t covering himself in glory, that suggests there’s no faith in the former.",

      "It’s never a great sign when the producer of a broadcaster flips from a close-up reaction shot of a player to a wide image of someone bearing down on goal with no-one anywhere near him. Something has definitely gone wrong.",
      "The individual in question presumably, and quite reasonably, thought Matheus Cunha’s frustration at not being awarded a free-kick after Diogo Dalot’s poor pass spoiled a very presentable opportunity on the break for Manchester United would make for better TV than whatever might happen from Jordan Henderson’s hoof forward.",
      "They couldn’t have predicted the electric shock Harry Maguire appeared to be subjected to as his absurdly tardy and ill-advised decision to play offside saw him jump forward in vain, as Igor Thiago charged toward the United goal to create a delightful 30-yard gap between the pair by the time the cameras caught up.",
      "It was some strike. The sort of f***-it finish that would end up in row Z 99 times out of 100 as Thiago half-volleyed the bouncing ball in off the stanchion.",
      "And after Ruben Amorim’s worrying suggestion that Bryan Mbeumo is “different” to the rest of his teammates as he doesn’t immediately catastrophise after going behind, the summer signing was powerless to a collective sh*tting of the bed from the pessimistic Red Devils which ensued for the next 15 minutes and barely abated for the rest of the game.",
      "The widely condemned Altay Bayindir did indeed look like the “only line of defence”, as observed by commentator Darren Fletcher, with the Turkey international making two excellent saves in quick succession to deny Sepp van den Berg and then Nathan Collins, as United’s work on set pieces in the warm-up looked only to have confused them. Brentford were first to every long throw-in or corner delivered into the box. And to balls smashed out from the back.",
      "Thiago is a big lad, and there’s no great shame in losing an aerial battle to him, but there absolutely is in allowing him to chest the ball down to a teammate under no pressure from a ball punted from at least 60 yards. It was pathetic from Mattihjs de Ligt, as was his failure to then track Thiago into the box as he tapped the ball in to double Brentford’s lead.",
      "His United teammates could have helped him out of a bind, but didn’t, with Manuel Ugarte, Maguire, Diogo Dalot and Luke Shaw the firefighters with their d*cks in their hands.",
      "And in a clear example of the fragile confidence at United, after a very solid start to the season, certainly compared to last, De Ligt crumbled, misplacing passes, misjudging the flight of the ball and conceding needless free-kicks. We particularly enjoyed that bit when he air kicked and fell over in his own box.",
      "We didn’t see any great uptick in forward fluency as United’s £200m forward trio started together for the first time. Link-up between Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha ended with either a poor final pass or a timid effort from one or the other until Cunha’s cross for Mbeumo led to the United penalty. And while Peter Crouch claimed Benjamin Sesko’s goal was an example of his “commitment”, it is undeniably funny that he needed three shots to score from inside the six-yard box.",
      "Manchester United may well have had the most shots (79), created the most chances (60) and accrued the most expected goals (9.7) in the Premier League after the first five games, but it never really felt as though the Brentford goal was under any great pressure.",
      "Amorim was proved right in sticking with Bayindir, who made another brilliant save to deny Dango Ouattara and keep his side in the game midway through the second half, but the space Outtara found himself in on the penalty spot begs the question as to why he continues to pick Manuel Ugarte.",
      "Kobbie Mainoo could be just as late in tracking back as the Uruguayan in such a situation, but also probably wouldn’t be, and wouldn’t either give the ball away or play a pass sideways or backwards whenever he has possession.",
      "And as predicted when the team news was announced, Amorim will face some difficult questions as to why he’s dropped Leny Yoro for the last two games after what looked to be a very assured start to the season. Both his speed and ability to progress the ball would have very useful here, and surely an improvement on what any of Maguire, De Ligt or Shaw provided.",

      "We thoroughly look forward to the PGMOL apology to Manchester United for somehow failing to advise Craig Pawson to even look at the pitch-side monitor as Nathan Collins denied Mbeumo one of the clearest goalscoring opportunities imaginable, particularly as the time it took to make that wrong decision contributed to an interminable wait for Bruno Fernandes to take the penalty which he then missed, as some excellent substitution sh*thousery from Keith Andrews made it a five-minute delay.",
      "United still had 15 minutes including stoppage time to draw level against a side which has dropped more points (8) from winning positions than any other team in the Premier League this season, but it was Brentford who added to their lead, with substitute Mathias Jensen combining with Yehor Yarmolyuk on the break before smashing the ball past Bayindir.",
      "Joe Cole described Manchester United as “abysmal” after the final whistle, but refused to pin the blame on Amorim, instead claiming it’s the old “culture of the club” problem rearing its head again.",
      "But f*** that. This is on Amorim. He picked the wrong team, his formation and tactics don’t work, and his players crumble at the merest hint of a hardship. If this isn’t the worst team in Manchester United history, it’s surely the easiest to play against. The best the fans can hope for is more false dawns under a manager not fit for purpose.",

      "Bayindir saved a tight effort from Kevin Schade, but parried immediately into the path of Igor Thiago, whose effort into the middle of the goal was met with Bayindir’s left hand, but he was unable to stop it, and he followed by punching the turf in frustration.",

      "Ruben Amorim has set himself up for criticism after three controversial selection calls as the Manchester United boss seeks back-to-back Premier League wins for the very first time as his side take on Brentford on Saturday.",
      "Amorim relieved some of the pressure on his shoulders through a 2-1 victory over Chelsea last time out, but it didn’t feel all that much like a turning point with Robert Sanchez’s red card and Enzo Maresca’s substitutions in response giving the Portuguese boss and his players a huge helping hand.",
      "Rio Ferdinand reckons seven points from five games constitutes a “remarkable” start to the season, though that claim in itself is far more remarkable than two wins and a draw.",
      "Much of the criticism of Amorim, aside from the results and performances, has centred around his refusal to waver from his now infamous 3-4-3 system and how it’s failing to get the best out of his players.",
      "It’s left Kobbie Mainoo, who was one of United’s greatest hopes for the future before Amorim arrived at Old Trafford, with a bit-part role, with the midfielder – who also starred for England at Euro 2024 – again starting on the bench vs Brentford, as has been the case in every Premier League game so far.",
      "Manuel Ugarte, who looks nothing like the player he was under Amorim at Sporting, has come in for Casemiro as the Brazilian serves a suspension following his daft red card against Chelsea.",
      "But it wasn’t Mainoo who was trending on social media when the team news was revealed – his absence is no great surprise – but Leny Yoro.",
      "The feeling among many Manchester United fans is that he’s been their best centre-back this season, maybe second best behind Matthijs de Ligt, but having been dropped for the win over Chelsea, the 19-year-old has again been left out, with Amorim sticking with a back three of De Ligt, Harry Maguire and Luke Shaw.",

      "And the third controversial call sees Altay Bayindir retain his spot in the team ahead of summer signing Senne Lammens amid suggestions this week that the £18m summer signing may come in for the Turkey international and despite the 23-year-old impressing in training.",
      "“I think he’s got all the fundamentals to be excellent. Again he’s another young boy. He’s coming to such a big club with lots of pressure. But I know he will deal with it and I’m sure he’s going to have a long future at this club.”",
      "The Red Devils fans will see forward trio Benjamin Sesko, Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo starting together for the first time against Brentford as a huge positive, but the pitchforks will be out for Amorim if they fail to beat the Bees, with the likely focus of that frustration around the three young talents he continues to snub in favour of players without such promising futures, either at Old Trafford or beyond.",

But while the Nuno comparisons are obvious, and a world in which Frank doesn’t make the November international break entirely possible, it doesn’t quite feel like the same situation.",

Whatever your thoughts on the timing and manner of Ange Postecoglou’s sacking and the identity of his replacement, it’s also clear Spurs have got the man they wanted in a way they very obviously didn’t when Nuno came in.",

No denying that this season does represent one in which Arteta might completely lose the plot and go entirely off the rails. Or the one where he wins the league by 10 points. Feels like we’re odds-on to get one or the other.",
      "Arsenal are broadly unscathed, yet it also does feel like they’re already playing catch-up from that all-too-familiar second place. So now we wait: is it full meltdown or sauntering to the league title? Nothing else will be tolerated or is indeed even possible.",

      "West Ham at home was a kind start for Sunderland and Le Bris, but boy did they cash in. Came back down to earth with a bump at Burnley, but the late turnaround to beat Brentford – and 0-0 draw with a good Palace side – means it’s a hugely encouraging start for the Black Cats and their manager.",

But we’ve never managed to make it stick even a tiny bit and we started the summer thinking there was little imminent prospect of going for it again with Howe the hero of the Geordie Nation for delivering silverware and more lovely, lovely Champions League football.",

      "Fine end to 24/25 put a different complexion on Brighton’s season than at one time appeared likely.

      "",
      "One of the key early-season imponderables for 25/26 was just how big and what kind of impact the Club World Cup might have on the way Chelsea and Man City start the season. Would they hit the ground running, or would they be a bit tired and out of sorts? For both, it’s been rather more of the latter than the former.",
      "He definitely still has some hearts and minds to win at Chelsea despite the fine finish to the season that saw them tick off Champions League qualification while completing their collection of UEFA pots and pans and then winning the actual Club World Cup.",
      "A home draw with Crystal Palace wasn’t ideal, but the paddling dished out to West Ham has what really should at least be some kind of halfway credible title bid up and running at least. And we strongly suspect Fulham won’t be the last team left scratching their head after losing to Maresca.",
      "There was some talk of ‘Maresca out’ after a draw with Brentford but that was surely only a minority view. After losing to Manchester United in shambolic fashion, there could be more on the wagon.",
      "",
      "Burnley really do have a horrible start under a manager with a horrible record at this level, and have already been given a clear reminder by the team that finished 17th last season of just how much harder the ‘simply don’t concede any goals at all’ tactic is going to be to deliver in the Premier League.",
      "Essentially, Burnley have got back to this level the same way Homer Simpson got to a heavyweight title fight. And Spurs have already given them a pummelling.",
      "Victory over Sunderland was an impressive and necessary reminder that it might still be enough against teams more on their level, but Parker will still need some fairly early evidence it can also work against established Premier League teams, which makes Burnley’s start so problematic and that win over Sunderland both vital yet potentially deceptive.",
      "There were encouraging signs before late heartbreak against eternally stupid Manchester United and against champions-elect Liverpool. A point against Forest was certainly a step in the right direction.",
      "",
      "The continuity candidate, but how much continuity can there be at Brentford given they’ve sold Bryan Mbeumo, Yoane Wissa and Christian Norgaard, while Thomas Frank took most of the remaining coaching staff with him to Tottenham? It’s a very Brentford move to promote from within but will they be forced into the very un-Brentford move of sacking him in October or November if and when the Bees are in a relegation battle?",
      "",
      "Won’t be sacked, obviously, because Palace are absolutely punching with an elite-level manager who is quietly delivering astonishing results in trying circumstances.",
      "But with reports he was willing and ready to walk out if Marc Guehi was sold without a replacement point to new strains on a relationship that is bound to be tested in the weeks and months ahead.",
      "Nailed it in the Community Shield, but as ever for clubs on Palace’s level there’s a positive-and-negative scale to be balanced by your manager catching the eye so conspicuously. Glasner absolutely could be poached with bigger beasts surely paying attention to the work he’s done at Selhurst Park.",
      "And if that poaching comes from outside the Premier League, then it comes with the possibility of making Glasner the next Premier League managerial casualty. But still very unlikely.",
      "The nerves at Selhurst Park will really kick in if/when Ruben Amorim gets the tin tack.",
      "",
      "It would have made Spurs’ decision to sack Europa League-winning Ange Postecoglou look positively kind, but there remains a decent case that Leeds – and Burnley for that matter – could or even should have thanked the managers who secured 100 Championship points and got them back into the big time and then sent them on their way.",
      "Farke had a dreadful Premier League record of only six wins and 26 points from his 49 games in charge of Norwich, a team he twice led to promotion from the Championship with 94 and 97 points.",
      "As well as fighting his own record in this competition, Farke faces the added burden of expectation levels very different to those at just about any other club that could possibly find itself promoted into the Premier League in this current era where that represents the most bittersweet of successes.",
      "Leeds’ lack of firepower against teams wallowing in slightly less despair than Wolves remains a concern, but two wins from the opening five games to go with a creditable draw against Newcastle is plenty enough to keep Farke gainfully employed for now.",
      "",
      "Postecoglou’s football is high-risk, high-reward and the larger body of Premier League evidence does now point to it being quite dramatically and fundamentally flawed at this level.",
      "And that was when he was deploying it with a Spurs squad far better suited to the approach than Nottingham Forest’s, especially in terms of defensive pace, mobility and technical ability.",
      "While it’s all smiles now between Postecoglou and Marinakis, it’s really not that hard to imagine a world where that all changes very, very quickly. Heavy defeats at Arsenal can and do happen to anyone – draws with Burnley less so – but it is an inauspicious start nonetheless for a manager whose methods have suffered a further blow by the speed and extent with which Spurs have improved basic things like ‘defending set-pieces’ and ‘attacking set-pieces’ and ‘having a midfield’ under Thomas Frank.",
      "",
      "Wolves absolutely love a sh*tbone awful start and enforced managerial change around November. The loss of key players and a disappointingly limp finish to last season after that thrilling run of wins through March and April mean those old doubts were nagging away even before a woeful pre-season, an opening-day paddling from new-look, old-destructiveness Man City and further defeats to Bournemouth, Everton, Newcastle United and now Leeds.",
      "Pereira should theoretically be fine after the work he did in steering Wolves so comfortably clear of any relegation trouble last season contributed heavily to him being give a new three-year contract in September. But making terrible starts that leave them in apparent relegation trouble before surviving comfortably in the end after a managerial change appears to now be ingrained in the club culture, an issue that transcends players and managers.",
      "There is some good news, though, because Wolves have a much-needed appointment scheduled with Dr Tottenham this weekend.",
      "",
      "Really isn’t that long ago that Emery was listed among your Slots and your Iraolas in this market, but it’s been an alarmingly bleak start to the season for a striving club with lofty ambitions but a worrisome balance sheet.",
      "Missing out on the Champions League in the manner they did at the end of last season was definitely a p*sser, and while Villa were perfectly good last season, it was one that felt a bit flat in the end. It was good, but it could have been great. They could have finished in the top five. They could have won the FA Cup. They could even have knocked out PSG in the Champions League after thar barnstorming Villa Park comeback.",
      "These annoyances are real and meaningful, and have leaked into this season. They are already out of the Carabao and took until the fifth game of the season just to score a Premier League goal that still wasn’t enough to secure a first victory of the season at 10-man Sunderland.",
      "Bleak fare indeed, and you do wonder whether Emery might now be minded to take any opportunity to jump ship that comes his way before his reputation starts to sink with Villa’s league position.",
      "",
      "Feels like one could, if one were so inclined, make the case for him being both top and bottom of this list.",
      "Top because United were staggeringly and at times unwatchably bad last season, as well as bottling the Europa League final in truly dismal fashion against planet earth’s most notorious pot-dodgers. Bottom because United have so clearly and determinedly nailed their colours to the Amorim mast that even if they remain staggeringly and at times unwatchably awful they might just stick with him out of pure stubbornness.",
      "But can he survive defeat to Grimsby Town? Should he? Victory over Burnley helps, but it could scarcely have been less convincing. And my word, they looked broken against Manchester City. The 10-man win over 10-man Chelsea is not a turning point; they’ve run out of those.",

      "Former Liverpool coach Thomas Gronnemark has hit out at Arne Slot, Mikel Arteta and other Premier League managers over their “really ugly” strategy.",
      "Gronnemark is famed for working under Jurgen Klopp between 2018 and 2023 and has imparted his expertise on a number of top clubs and national teams as the world’s only professional throw-in coach.",
      "The 49-year-old used to hold the world record for the longest throw-in, at 51.33 metres and has spent 21 years carving throw-in niche for himself, but isn’t impressed by the standard of them in the Premier League this season as we see a huge uptick in the number of long throws.",
      "He claims “the level from Liverpool, Arsenal, Manchester United and Newcastle is really low” in what is a “really ugly” part of the game thanks to the poor strategy.",
      "“You can say there are many more long throw-ins in the Premier League. You can say ‘isn’t that good?’ No, not necessarily! There are far too many teams taking low-quality long throw-ins. Some of the throw-ins are just not long enough, so they’re not dangerous, and sometimes it’s about the strategy,” Gronnemark told Mirror.",
      "“It’s also about entertainment for the fans. People might think that a guy who coaches long throw-ins wants a lot of them. Actually, I don’t. I don’t want to see every team take 10 long throw-ins in every game because then we have too much start and stop.",
      "“People just look at the best teams and say ‘they’re having real success data-wise, so we’ll do the same’. But they are forgetting that there’s a lot of work, many years’ worth, behind it. You have to do space creation around the opponents’ penalty area.",
      "“To be honest, for most teams, throw-ins are a really ugly part because the quality is so low, the ball is being thrown into high-pressure situations where there are duels,” he explains. “There are too many chaotic throw-ins in the Premier League: the level from Liverpool, Arsenal, Manchester United and Newcastle is really low. Possession rates are at around 25 to 33 per cent on throw-ins under pressure. The standard is really low.",
      "“When I was at Liverpool the quality went up, but it’s started to go down again. I think one of the reasons is that they’re only training one or two routines in each zone. Yeah, it can work but your players have to learn to think throw-ins.”",
      "MORE LIVERPOOL COVERAGE ON F365\n👉 Liverpool: New Romano update on Reds star suggests only one outcome of ‘difficult conversation’\n👉 Arsenal: ‘Fed up’ Paul Merson proves panic with two kneejerk PL title predictions amid baffling U-turn\n👉 Arsenal title hopes ‘kaput’ this weekend on two conditions: ‘Liverpool big favourites’",
      "Gronnemark has been working with Brentford this season and they stand out as a team benefitting from their use, having put 23 into the opponents’ penalty area this season, resulting in one goal, 11 shots and 1.29 xG.",
      "“If you’re a world-class throw-in taker, it’s much easier to put the ball where you want with a throw-in than with a corner kick,” he added. “How many corners hit the first man? It’s hard to kick with your foot. It’s much easier to throw with your hands if you have the right technique.",
      "“There are a lot of set piece coaches now and a lot of them treat the throw-in like a corner or a free-kick.",
      "“So they say ‘we can have one or two routines in each zone’. But the challenge is that the opponents’ defending pattern will already mark this from the start then the players have a big challenge.",
      "“Even with the biggest teams in the Premier League, you can see that if they make one move and it doesn’t work then the players don’t know what to do – they’re getting confused, frustrated because they don’t have a high throw-in intelligence.”",
      "Arne Slot has confirmed that Liverpool defender Geovanni Leoni will miss “around a year”, but refused to say he regrets missing out on Marc Guehi.",

      "“Short term, I wouldn’t be surprised at [Carrick or Fletcher to replace Amorim] at all,” Nevin said, speaking to gaming news publisher Escapist Magazine. “That would be absolutely fine. And they might do well.",
      "“They offered the caretaker role to Ole first didn’t they. It takes the pressure off, you can have a good look around. And if he does well, we just keep him. That’s fine.

      "Paul Scholes was ‘bitter’ and ‘nasty’ in an assessment of Marcus Rashford which captured a ‘spitefulness’ still holding Manchester United back.",
      "And why are Football365 trying to get Ange Postecoglou sacked?",
      "Send your thoughts to theeditor@football365.com.",
      "",
      "Longtime reader, first time mailer. Naturally I decided to pop the cherry on a safe and non-controversial topic: Marcus Rashford.",
      "I think the problem with what Ian Watson and a handful of Mailbox ultras have been saying about the ongoing Scholes/Rashford drama is that they think that the reason why what Scholes said is problematic is solely because of the content. It’s not. It’s the very presence of the comment in a public space.",
      "To explain: Paul Scholes is fully entitled to enjoy (or not enjoy) any opinion of Marcus Rashford that he likes. He can hate him for any number of reasons, including – and this is important – stupid, nonsensical ones. Furthermore, as a United fan it makes perfect sense for him to resent Rashford up and leaving them, and there is no sense in demanding that he or any United fan wish him the best.",
      "The problem is that Paul Scholes is not just a United fan. He is a massively famous pundit who is paid, I imagine, a lot of money to talk about football. And what irks me about him STILL moaning about Rashford is just how utterly unnecessary it all is at this point. Love them or hate them, United this season are absolutely delicious narratively. They are either a sleeping giant about to awake or an old palace burning down, depending on your outlook, but the one thing that is totally not part of this saga is Marcus bloody Rashford. He is GONE. It is time to MOVE ON.",
      "I guess what I’m saying is that there seems to be an assumption from old pros that their every opinion deserves to be heard, all the time, no matter what. But I don’t particularly give a monkey’s what Scholes thinks of Rashford as a person. I’m interested in what he thinks of him as a footballer, but modern pundits aren’t quite as vocal on that subject.",
      "There is also something so bitter and nasty about Scholes saying what he said, because as much as it’s fair to hold Rashford responsible for his performances at United, it’s also important to bear in mind that the club wanted him gone. It was generally accepted that he had to go in the summer for his own good and the club’s. So with that in mind, what is the point of seeing a young man finding a new lease of life after years of sullen, uninspired football, and then nastily snipe him from the pundit box? It smacks of spitefulness and is one of the many reasons why I think all the Alex Ferguson old boys – Scholes, Keane, Ferdinand and Neville – have been absolutely toxic for both punditry and United as an institution. If we must talk about United then let’s talk about United, if we must talk about Barcelona let’s talk about Barcelona, but swiping at Rashford for his bad performances last season just drags down the conversation. I would expect better from a man of Scholes’ age.",
      "Correct opinion? Maybe. I don’t think so personally, but that’s not really the point. Why does it actually need to be said, is the real question. Does it enlighten the fans? Does it explain United’s struggles this season? Does it explain Barcelona’s success? No. It’s just meaningless negativity, like so much of modern football.",
      "It also is yet another example of United old boys finding a way to tear down a young black man no matter the situation. Every single time. But let’s not get ahead of ourselves, this mail is long enough as is.\nSamuel, Fulham fan till the end",

      "Dear Reader,",
      "I hope you are all well (or at least caffeinated). I just read two recent F365 takes on Marcus Rashford.",
      "Let me save you some time: I don’t care whether Rashford sulked at Manchester United.",
      "Before you throw a tomato at me for lack of nuance, allow me to explain:",
      "1. Sulking is a spectator’s hobby",
      "If a player is walking, moody, whispering dire oaths in the tunnel — I’ll raise an eyebrow, maybe tweet (sorry X) about it, but I’m not launching moral crusades. Football is messy. Players are people. Sometimes they sulk. Big deal.",
      "2. Would you want to play in the current Manchester United team?",
      "Let me ask you this, dear reader: if someone handed you a contract today to play for this Manchester United — the board, the chaos, the constant managerial churning, the pressure to be more myth than person — would you take it?",
      "Because spare me the nostalgia of “United would have done this” — the United of today is a far cry from the Fergie glory years.",
      "3. Rashford is doing well at Barça",
      "While some are busy flinging “disgrace” accusations, Rashford has started making noise in Barcelona. He’s scoring, contributing, adapting. He’s quieting critics the best way — by playing. And (whisper it) I happen to think that’s more compelling than being praised from my cheap seat at Old Trafford.",
      "4. Even Alex Hunter wouldn’t want to play for Manchester United",
      "Yes, I just dragged a FIFA video game character into this. But hear me out: Alex Hunter (from the FIFA story mode) has tons of dramatic options. If the script handed him the chance to play for Man Utd — under the current regime, under the weight of expectation and instability — I reckon he’d look at his agent and say, “Nah, I’ll play for a mid-tier side and enjoy my life.”",
      "Because even in fantasy land, there’s an escape clause.",
      "So here’s my bottom line: you can publish/ podcast a hundred think-pieces dissecting Rashford’s body language, demeanor, or public statements. But unless you’ve walked in his boots — including the ones he’s now laced up in Barcelona — you should STFU and don’t get to claim moral high ground.\nGaptoothfreak, Man. Utd. fan with too much time, New York",
      "",
      "Long, long time reader of 2 decades. Occasional letter writer.",
      "I wrote in last year about how the site is actively trying to generate managerial sackings and drama, to create negative narratives about clubs, managers and players. For clicks I assume, and instead of analytical articles that are harder to write. The standard of writing has fallen a long way.",
      "I have a 15 year old daughter who has a longer concentration span, and is less fickle and emotional,  more mature . The knee jerking and need to create a story is a far cry from earlier years, where there was mature reporting and genuine humour.",
      "Now we have a site that is essentially a list of top 10s. “Next manager to be sacked“,  “Top 10 replacements for Ange”. A couple of bad results and the narrative begins “X is under pressure”.",
      "Ange has had 4 games. 4 away games. He had a couple days before the Arsenal game, so essentially 3 games. All away. 2 draws where they dominated. Let’s start building an Ange out narrative, spread it across social media until it reaches fans who put pressure on the owner and he pulls the trigger so you can say “we were right”.",
      "He won a major trophy, got Spurs into the CL. Recruited a large number of excellent players. Such is the poor attention span and need for instant gratification people are now disregarding a 5th place finish in his first season. He got lucky at the start of the season apparently. Trying to paint him as though he’s a village idiot. There was a zero percent chance of Spurs going down at any time, and he knew it, so switched attention to CL qualification.",
      "Would fans rather win a trophy or finish 8th? Who had a better season last year, Spurs or Villa? One won a trophy they’ll be talking about for generations, qualified for the CL. Would you rather finish 6- 8th every year, play conservatively and have a cup run?",
      "Oh, and now apparently Emery, the golden boy of the last 2 seasons is now under pressure after a slow start, according to 365. His last 2 seasons don’t count anymore because of a few poor games.",
      "Jesus.\nFadida",
      "",
      "Read that Sulivan is considering Bilic as manager with Mark Noble and James Collins as assistants. This beggars belief but perhaps helpfully demonstrates the board’s thought process.",
      "While Nobes and the ginger Brazilian will always be club legends, we all know that the ‘club player to manager role’ route is almost always a complete disaster. And Bilic is conspicuously out of work. So for Sullivan, he thinks “fan favorites, and they are all so thick that this will therefore surely stop the protests, tick, “costs me absolutely nothing”, tick. That’s how shallow and clueless this guy is.",
      "I appreciate that with Moyes, Lopetegui and now Potter, WH fans must have a reputation for complaining about any new manager, but as long as Sullivan is in place using the club as a personal money bank, this is going to go on and on.\nMike, WHU",

      "There was a rare occasion where I agreed with John Nicholson when he bemoaned stats and said we’d turn football “from poetry to maths”.  One of the things that’s especially irritating about the saturation of stats is that the average punter either doesn’t understand them or misuses them, xG being the most obvious example.",
      "xG is pretty meaningless in telling you about how an individual game has gone. A late goalmouth scramble having been under the cosh all game can massively boost a side’s  xG but isn’t reflective of the whole. The stat only becomes relevant when viewed over a sweep of games, and can then be used to tell you trends of many goals a team should be scoring/conceding and whether they’re getting lucky.",
      "Stats can be a useful tool, but they’re ultimately quite boring and especially when being used by a boring person to backup a boring opinion.\nLewis, Busby Way (Le Tissier was wonderful, he’d be dropped on his stats)",
      "",
      "Following news that Gary Neville was pedalling Kane to Chelsea/United instead of Spurs (should he even return to these shores), I found a little bile rising to my throat at the thought of Kane in another English clubs shirt – it’d just be wrong now, no? Not like the weird, yet heart-warming feeling of seeing early Shearer footage in the red and white of the Draper Tools kit – but actually quite horrifying.",
      "Then it gots me to thinking… who could never have worn anything but their last clubs shirt?",
      "I don’t think it’d have bothered me to see Giggs or Scholes wear an Arsenal shirt for example and that’s not an indictment on those two, just, some players would look ghastly in another teams shirt and the initial ones that come to mind are:",
      "Cantona – his year at Leeds was one thing – but imagine if he’d “pulled an Ince” and put on a Liverpool shirt?\nHenry – if he was in England, it had to be Arsenal, surely\nGerrard – imagine him taking a year at Palace before he retired?\nHibbert – an original one-clubber – and he is just EVERTON.\nSlightly left field one to end my starters – Tony Yeboah – that man could NEVER have worn anything other than Leeds Blanco while in Blighty",
      "Arguably the biggest version of “another shirt would be horrifying” would even be abroad… imagine a world where Totti, took a few years with Inter or Juve. Ew.",
      "Thoughts?\nHarold Ernand Hooler",
      "Erling Haaland has been a Premier League player for barely three seasons but has already outscored a legion of legends and is firing Norway to the World Cup.",

      "Has the Club World Cup absolutely cocked up Chelsea’s season? It’s starting to feel like that with such a long injury list.",
      "Every Arsenal game currently seems to be wracked with tension, and a trip to Newcastle will be no different on another Big Weekend.",
      "Liverpool will probably manage without their fourth-choice centre-half and there are a fair few reasons why panicking over Eberechi Eze at Arsenal is daft.",
      "According to reports, FC Barcelona face missing out on Marcus Rashford as Manchester United are set to receive a ‘bigger than expected offer’."

      "Manchester United legend Rio Ferdinand has made a prediction relating to Luke Shaw after the England international was heavily criticised by Roy Keane.",
      "When fit and firing, Shaw has proven that he is can be one of the best full-backs in the Premier League.",
      "However, injuries and poor form have impacted the Man Utd star in recent years and Keane blasted him for his poor performance in his side’s 3-0 loss against Manchester City.",
      "Keane has argued that the England international has been “getting away with murder for years”.",
      "“Shaw is an international footballer, so for him to get caught out like that,” Keane said.",
      "READ: Ruben Amorim should avoid ‘complete honesty’ when it’s an admission of Man Utd ignorance",
      "“I think he has been getting away with murder for years at United. Always injured and never quite fit.",
      "“We make excuses and then he gets a few games under his belt and he’s making decisions like he doesn’t even want to tackle anyone.”",
      "Shaw subsequently issued an honest response, admitting that the pundit had a point as he needs to do better for Man Utd.",
      "The left-back has since been defended by teammate Harry Maguire, with Ferdinand taking time to praise the two defenders.",
      "Ferdinand has backed Shaw to respond by “putting in a performance” against Brentford this weekend.",
      "“Personally I think it is great from Harry Maguire because that is the job of a captain/senior player to come in and defend your players if you think that they are being unfairly treated,” Ferdinand told MEN Sport.",
      "“I also think Luke Shaw coming out and speaking himself is what I like.",
      "“I like to see players come out and go: ‘You know what, I am not having that or actually, they are right. I was under par for the level that I have set myself.’",
      "“I am sure he will put in a performance this week Luke Shaw, that will make you think: ‘He is made of the right stuff.’ I just think that Luke Shaw is a magnificently talented player, he has just been so unfortunate with injuries that he has never been able to maintain his fitness and it goes back to that word again, consistency.",
      "“If you can’t be consistent with appearances and being available, it is going to be difficult for you to really stamp your authority and really sustain the level of performances that is required for a top club.”",
      "Rio Ferdinand thinking Man Utd have been ‘remarkable’ is far more remarkable than their start to the season under Ruben Amorim. How the mighty have fallen.",
      "Man Utd legend Rio Ferdinand has criticised Benjamin Sesko after the striker had just six touches in the first half against ten-man Chelsea.",
      "Mikel Arteta isn’t a gambler like Sir Alex Ferguson was, and that could cost Arsenal the Premier League title, says Man Utd legend Roy Keane.",
      "Rio Ferdinand has revealed whether he’d rather have Erling Haaland or Kylian Mbappe with the Manchester City star “blitzing” teams like he did Manchester United.",
      "Manchester United lost their third game of the season on Sunday as rivals Manchester City beat them 3-0 in a comprehensive performance.",
      "Manchester United legend Rio Ferdinand has told the Arsenal fans criticising the signing of Noni Madueke to “say sorry” to their new “saviour”."

      "Ruben Amorim is a man now famed for his honesty in press conferences. If anything, he’s too honest.",
      "The Manchester United chiefs weren’t all that enamoured with his response to questions about Kobbie Mainoo’s future, for example, nor his threats last season to walk away from the club if results didn’t improve.",
      "That integrity is a key part of his charisma, which was supposedly a key draw for Sir Jim Ratcliffe and the INEOS bosses when selecting the Portuguese boss as their replacement for Erik ten Hag.",
      "But again, with Brentford incredibly offering up an opportunity for Amorim to earn back-to-back Premier League wins for the very first time, when asked by a reporter in the press conference what the key to consistency is for Manchester United, we would advise Amorim against “complete honesty” when it’s an admission of ignorance.",
      "“It is normal that the fans don’t know what is going to happen in the next game. To be completely honest, I have an idea, but I don’t know how it’s going to be and I’m the manager of the team! The best way of dealing with that is every game is the last one.”",
      "We enjoy self-deprecation as much as anyone, and understand that it’s no more than a jovial, throwaway comment from a man under pressure; someone quite frankly embarrassed that after ten months in charge of one of the biggest clubs in world football he’s yet to win two league games on the bounce.",
      "Without similarly cheeky lines he may not still be in the job, with his press conference manner the key to this aura of stability and confidence he’s managed to fabricate for himself despite the chaos on the pitch.",

      "And of course, like any other football manager, he doesn’t really know what’s going to happen in any game. It’s presumably why he loves football, if he does indeed still love it.",
      "But five games into a new season in which there’s been no great sign of progress after leading them in their worst campaign in living memory, not knowing whether his team is going to be any good or not feels awfully close to the bone of contention that he doesn’t know how to turn things around at Old Trafford.",
      "No Manchester United fan will be turning up for this clash at Brentford tomorrow with any clue as to how their team perform on a scale from not bad to terrible, but should the manager not have more than “an idea”? Or at least put the brutal honesty on hold and claim that he does?",
      "Because as much as anything, we’re not sure it’s an admission the famously fragile Manchester United players will be using as any great motivation to break this two-game hoodoo."

      "We must be honest and concede that it’s not quite as chunky a Big Weekend as the last couple, but it’s another where the fixture computer’s capriciousness could leave Arsenal again fearing the worst and playing catch-up at a ground with bad recent memories for Arteta and co.",
      "Meanwhile every weekend is Big for Big Ange Postecoglou as he has another stab at getting a first win to go with all the lovely attacking football he’s got Forest playing now.",
      "And in not unrelated news, beleaguered Wolves head to London hoping for a restorative visit to Dr Tottenham.",
      "",
      "We once again find ourselves with some degree of sympathy for Arsenal and the machinations of the fixture computer. Liverpool once again have first-mover advantage on a weekend when Arsenal’s task is a difficult one.",
      "Liverpool have no penalty kick themselves at Selhurst Park, but if they can win – via late shirt-removing methods or otherwise – then Arsenal face another Sunday afternoon when any slight slip will come with outsized consequences.",
      "Arsenal could be eight points adrift by the time they kick off at a stadium where their recent record is not good. Arsenal lost twice at St James’ Park last season without scoring a goal, in the league and again in the Carabao Cup semi-finals, extending a record in Newcastle that now reads one win and four defeats on their last five visits.",
      "For Newcastle, this game represents a test of what has been a few weeks of tentative promise since the cruel late defeat to Liverpool. That was a game that featured 83 per cent of all goals scored in Premier League games involving Newcastle this season. Three of their other four games have finished goalless, along with a 1-0 home win over hapless Wolves.",
      "This is a game that should give a pretty clear indication of whether the last few weeks have represented recovery and growth, or just not playing any of the top teams for a bit. At least domestically; there was plenty of encouragement too in a narrow Champions League defeat to Barcelona.",
      "The fact Liverpool have already won here adds another dash of intrigue and jeopardy for Arsenal; it already feels like an achievement that even at this early stage they must match. And a game where all evidence from Newcastle’s efforts outside that Liverpool defeat suggest Mikel Arteta will simply have to release that infamous handbrake of his.",
      "",
      "We’re really not sure how much longer Viktor Gyokeres scoring the wrong kind of goals is going to keep providing a covering narrative for the fact the big-money striker Man United chose after missing out on the Swede still doesn’t have any goals, at all, against anyone up to and including Grimsby Town.",
      "Sesko played the full 90 minutes of that match before infamously stepping up as the last outfield player to take a penalty for United in the dignity-sapping shoot-out that followed.",
      "While he’s been more sporadically used in the Premier League, he has nevertheless now played a tick under 300 minutes of football for United without a goal or assist to his name.",
      "It’s not Sesko’s fault that United paid what they paid for him, nor that he is the latest pawn in the wider United banter circus.",
      "But he’s going to need to start helping himself soon, and a Saturday lunchtime trip to a hollowed-out Brentford side who have shipped seven goals in their last three Premier League games represents just about as good a chance as any at this point.",
      "If anything, has the great man’s start at Nottingham Forest perhaps been too Postecoglou? We really don’t want to complain, or indeed to appear greedy and ungrateful, but it has felt like all the key elements of Postecoglou’s football have been crammed into the last few weeks.",
      "Forest have started playing some truly gorgeous attacking football, and some truly catastrophic defensive football. They have failed to defend leads against teams as diverse as Swansea, Burnley and Real Betis, while the hamstring injuries that plagued Big Ange’s riotously entertaining two years at Tottenham are already making an unwanted appearance in Nottingham.",
      "Sunderland at home would have been a fixture most teams were chalking up as three points when the computer spat out the schedule back in June, but a lot has changed for both Sunderland and Forest since then.",
      "It’s an awkwardly big game now for Postecoglou, with last weekend’s failure to put Burnley away exacerbated by the same failing in the Europa League in midweek.",
      "There are many reasons why Postecoglou is currently a fixture in the manager to watch slot. One, it’s just pretty much always entertaining and who doesn’t enjoy that? But a second reason is the clear and certain sense that we should enjoy it while we can, because it doesn’t feel likely that Angeball is back on any kind of long-term basis.",
      "We’re not yet in must-win territory, even for Mr Marinakis, but there is a sense of ‘if not now, when?’ about Postecoglou’s quest for a first victory with his new club. After Sunderland, it’s Midtjylland and Newcastle before the October international break and Chelsea, Porto, Bournemouth, Manchester United, Sturm Graz, Leeds, Liverpool and Malmo before the end of November.",
      "Manchester United should provide few problems, given Postecoglou’s formline there, but with the rest of that run of games it doesn’t require a vivid imagination to picture it all spiralling rapidly out of control.",
      "",
      "Five defeats to begin the Premier League season, which extends Vitor Pereira’s side’s overall winless league run to nine vexing matches since the giddy spring days of winning six in a row.",
      "With Wolves’ own deep woes and a squad left woefully under-powered after a difficult summer exacerbated by clear signs of life at all three promoted clubs, you already find yourself wondering how much longer the club can afford to wait before taking decisive action to arrest the slide and save their season.",
      "It feels wild to be talking this way given just how adroitly Pereira steered Wolves out of trouble back in March and April, but the drop-off has been gargantuan and the context of that six-game winning run starting to look slightly different.",
      "It was a run that featured all three relegated sides as well as West Ham, Manchester United and Tottenham who were very much the worst of the non-relegated teams in the second half of last season.",
      "Six straight wins is still six straight wins, but there has to be some acknowledgement they came against the six easiest possible opponents with very little scope for hope or optimism since.",
      "Until now. It’s Spurs again for Wolves this weekend and, while they do look a very different and less banterous beast under Thomas Frank, they are still Tottenham. The Doctor will see you now.",
      "",
      "A key midlands derby between two teams with clear Premier League ambitions, Coventry having lost out in the play-offs in two out of the last three seasons while remaining unbeaten in the Championship this season under Frank Lampard, and Birmingham’s targeting of back-to-back promotions back to the big time long since certain to be one of the EFL’s key talking points this season.",
      "Coventry could do with turning draws into wins, while Birmingham are still yet to truly settle on their best XI in a brave new world, yet both can be reasonably content with how things are shaping up, both reaching ten points after six games to sit in and around the play-off spots at this early stage.",
      "",
      "The two Madrid giants have made wildly contrasting starts in La Liga thus far, with Real Madrid currently boasting a flawless 18 points from their opening six games but Atleti managing only half that.",
      "They needed a late Julian Alvarez-inspired comeback to see off Rayo Vallecano at home in midweek, while their Champions League campaign got off to a gut-wrenching start at Liverpool the week before.",

      "",
      "There is no imaginable football where this isn’t a big game, albeit that as far as the women’s game is currently concerned the balance of power lies rather differently to the men’s. United have made a fine start to the new WSL season after a pair of handsome wins over Leicester and London City and a creditable goalless draw against Arsenal.",
      "Liverpool, meanwhile, still await their first point after a humbling Merseyside Derby defeat to Everton and then going down at Leicester after the hosts were reduced to 10 early in the second half.",
      "Sunderland have won at Nottingham Forest, who remain winless under Ange Postecoglou. His appointment is somehow going worse than anyone expected.",
      "Erling Haaland has been a Premier League player for barely three seasons but has already outscored a legion of legends and is firing Norway to the World Cup.",
      "Paul Scholes was ‘bitter’ and ‘nasty’ in an assessment of Marcus Rashford which captured a ‘spitefulness’ still holding Manchester United back.",
      "Spurs are definitely about to sign stars from Chelsea, Bayern Munich, Real Madrid and Barcelona while keeping Djed Spence and his penitentiary at left-back.",
      "Has the Club World Cup absolutely cocked up Chelsea’s season? It’s starting to feel like that with such a long injury list.",
      "Liverpool will probably manage without their fourth-choice centre-half and there are a fair few reasons why panicking over Eberechi Eze at Arsenal is daft."

      "Brighton midfielder Carlos Baleba should be off the market in January, but a summer exit for Manchester United remains a real possibility, according to Ben Jacobs.",
      "Man Utd made a late move for Baleba, 21, in the summer transfer window after spending over £200million on Bryan Mbeumo, Matheus Cunha, and Benjamin Sesko.",
      "There have been reports of Liverpool competing with the Red Devils for Baleba’s signature, but transfer expert Jacobs poured cold water on that.",
      "“I’m not really aware of Liverpool making a particular push for a deep-lying midfielder. Should Liverpool add, it might be more of an attacking midfielder,” he told The United Stand.",
      "Jacobs added that Man Utd did a lot of “legwork” in August, making it very unlikely they will walk away from their pursuit of Baleba next year.",
      "“One of the reasons they (Man Utd) did all the legwork over the final weeks of the window was to try and put themselves in the strongest possible position, because I think they will be moving for Carlos Baleba,” he continued.",
      "MORE: Man Utd choose ‘elite’ manager as ‘prime candidate’ to replace Amorim amid two reasons for verdict",
      "“You don’t commit to what would have been potentially a 100 million-plus spend and then just walk away, because there’ll be a point in 12 months’ time where that player is for sale.",
      "“Even though many may feel 100 million is a lot of money, and something that could get a deal done, Brighton’s data and approach is to think this is a player that might be a Moises Caicedo-type fee, 115 million or more in 12 months’ time.",
      "“That projection of value effectively priced Baleba out of the market and stopped anybody bidding, because Brighton felt no one is going to match the valuation, and therefore the player is simply not for sale.",
      "“So if Manchester United want Carlos Baleba, but they don’t have to worry about Liverpool or anyone else, they have to worry about probably finding 100-plus million, maybe even closer to 115 or 120 million, hoping that Brighton want to sell, which is far more likely in a year’s time.",
      "“If it isn’t Liverpool, there’ll be other suitors for Baleba, and that’s the whole point really. Brighton think that, first of all, in a year’s time there’ll be multiple suitors, so the price goes up. Second of all, form, hopefully, from Brighton’s point of view in the next 12 months, also adds to the valuation.",
      "“With Manchester United and senior midfielders, I think there is a strong possibility that two come in. So could it be Baleba and [Adam] Wharton, or two other senior midfielders? Absolutely. First of all, because Casemiro could still depart, even though he’s found favour under Ruben Amorim. Second of all, because Bruno Fernandes could go off to Saudi Arabia, and that could fund the window in 12 months’ time.”",
      "Asked if Man Utd could bid for Baleba in January, Jacobs quickly quashed the idea.",
      "“I don’t see a January sale for Carlos Baleba, that’s the first thing to say,” he said.",
      "“The start to the season may have been influenced by some of the summer speculation. There’s no doubt his head was turned by Manchester United, but we’re so early in the season, I don’t think we can equate a dip in form with a dip in valuation, or a dip in form with a January exit.",
      "“Brighton have shown with several players that they sell when they want to, based on their own long-term plan, and the only thing that may alter the Baleba situation is the fact that David Weir unexpectedly left, and Jason Ayto, the former Arsenal interim sporting director, has come in. So there’s a new voice and consideration over what they do in the market.",
      "“But remember, January is very much a seller’s market. It’s difficult for buyers in a short space of time, and it’s mid-season, and we know Brighton’s approach is to sell on their terms, their timeline, their price.",
      "“In addition to that, with a replacement coming in — all of which would be hard to do in a January window — it would be a big shock if Baleba went anywhere in January. But I also think it’d be equally as big a shock if Brighton didn’t engage more seriously over a summer sale, because these players, when they join Brighton, know there will be a period in time where they can be sold and move on to another club.",
      "“With Baleba, the feeling is that if you look at the whole season, rather than just these first few games, come the end of the season, Brighton feel his valuation will be even higher than the number that they put over his head privately, but not to Manchester United.”",
      "Man Utd ‘leading the race for a No.6’? Not a chance with Liverpool and Man City around. Will the Red Devils have to settle for Carlos Baleba?",
      "Man Utd will reportedly push to sign Brighton midfielder Carlos Baleba in January, which surely means Kobbie Mainoo is being pushed out.",
      "Manchester United face a nightmare scenario if/when Liverpool hijack their arch-rivals in the race for a ‘dream’ transfer in 2026…",
      "Liverpool have just broken the British transfer record for an ‘£86m player’ but have their own ideas about Carlos Baleba and Michael Olise.",
      "Liverpool are making ‘serious moves’ to land a star Manchester United midfield target in the January transfer window, according to insider Indy Kaila.",
      "According to reports, Manchester United already have a ‘plan’ for a ‘huge’ double deal as they ‘want to bring in two new midfielders’."

      "Bought for an initial £18million, his outstanding form for the Eagles has seen his value soar to €45million (£39m) on Transfermarkt, though Palace are likely to only entertain offers worth at least £60m.",
      "Wharton was rewarded for his fine form with his England debut in June 2024 and a spot in Gareth Southgate’s squad for last summer’s European Championship.",

      "READ: Man Utd ‘leading race’ they’re going to lose to Man City, Liverpool for three midfielders",
      "Wharton showed elite mentality to bounce back from his international disappointment with a fantastic 2024/25 campaign, helping Palace win the FA Cup and finish 12th in the Premier League.",
      "He has been a crucial player under Oliver Glasner, who lost Ebere Eze to Arsenal in the summer transfer window after Eze scored the only goal in the FA Cup final against Manchester City.",
      "Glasner kept hold of club captain Marc Guehi after his transfer to Liverpool fell through, while Jean-Philippe Mateta and Wharton also stayed at Selhurst Park.",
      "Wharton was linked with a move away in the summer, but nothing materialised amid reported interest from Man Utd.",

      "Asked on The United Stand if Liverpool are interested in signing Man Utd-linked Brighton midfielder Carlos Baleba, Jacobs dropped the transfer bombshell regarding the Palace and England youngster.",
      "“I’m not really aware of Liverpool making a particular push for a deep-lying midfielder,” he said. “Should Liverpool add, it might be more of an attacking midfielder.",
      "“With the likes of Adam Wharton and Carlos Baleba, we know that they’re going to be in demand.",
      "“My understanding with Wharton is there’s this kind of a gentleman’s agreement in place allowing him to leave Crystal Palace next summer. So that’s clearly going to be one to watch.",
      "“In the same way that Eberechi Eze, even though it wasn’t his release clause, was allowed to depart even after the release clause expired. I think Wharton could leave Crystal Palace next summer.”",
      "Jacobs also says that Man Utd could add two midfielders next summer after failing to land £100m-rated Baleba, with Bruno Fernandes potentially moving to Saudi Arabia and funding a big transfer window not ruled out.",

      "According to reports, Manchester United have already picked out a ‘prime candidate’ to replace under-fire head coach Ruben Amorim.",
      "Man Utd‘s struggles from last season have carried over into this campaign, as there is little sign of improvement under Amorim.",
      "Under Amorim, the Red Devils have gone backwards and hit a new low in 2024/25, finishing 15th in the Premier League in a trophyless season.",
      "This season, Man Utd have already been knocked out of the Carabao Cup by League Two side Grimsby Town and have suffered defeats in the Premier League against Man City and Arsenal to sit 11th after five games.",
      "Therefore, Amorim is among the favourites to be the next Premier League manager sacked and he remains under pressure following last weekend’s surprising 2-1 win against Chelsea.",
      "READ: Rashford is being ‘bullied’? Actually, Scholes ‘disgrace’ verdict was fair comment…",
      "Man Utd desperately need to build momentum and Amorim will be under huge pressure if his side fails to beat Brentford on Saturday afternoon.",
      "In the meantime, Man Utd are being linked with several potential replacements and a report from journalist Fraser Fletcher for our pals at TEAMtalk claims they have settled on AFC Bournemouth boss Andoni Iraola as their ‘prime candidate’ and ‘top choice’ to replace Amorim.",
      "The report claims Iraola is also attracting interest from Chelsea and Manchester City after Spurs opted against a move for him in the summer.",
      "Man Utd are said to be in favour of Iraola due to ‘his tactical acumen and ability to maximise limited resources’.",
      "The report adds:",
      "‘United’s hierarchy view Iraola as an elite coach capable of navigating the intense pressure of managing a global giant. His ability to implement a cohesive system at Bournemouth, coupled with his success in developing young talents, has convinced United bosses of his readiness for a step up.",
      "‘Manchester City are also tracking Iraola as a potential successor to Pep Guardiola, whose departure is speculated to be on the horizon in the coming seasons. Meanwhile, TEAMtalk understands that at Chelsea, Iraola is on the radar as a contingency plan should Enzo Maresca’s tenure unravel.’",
      "Despite this, a recent report from Football Insider journalist Pete O’Rourke revealed that Bournemouth are “doing everything” to keep Iraola.",
      "“I think obviously if Man United do decide to part ways with Amorim, they’re going to look for the best man for the job,” O’Rourke told Football Insider.",
      "“The Manchester United job will still be attractive, whatever their current situation, still a huge club, huge fan base and obviously there has been financial backing in the transfer market as well for managers.",
      "“Iraola has done a remarkable job of Bournemouth, because he lost most of his top players this summer, but still really flourishing at Bournemouth.",
      "“Obviously, Bournemouth are looking to tie him down to a new contract.",
      "“They’re doing everything they can to agree terms and convince him to stay, because they don’t want to lose him, especially to a Premier League rival even if it is Man United.",
      "“But look for United right now, they’re still remaining fully behind Amorim and they hope that he can turn things around.”",
      "Ruben Amorim is on his last legs after another insipid Premier League display from the ‘trash’ that is Man Utd, as Bruno Fernandes is slammed.",
      "Manchester United have been slammed as “shambolic” and a pair of players called out for making individual errors, while Ruben Amorim’s system caused “100 per cent confusion.”",
      "Ruben Amorim is surely done for. The Man Utd defence is laughable, the midfield unworkable and there’s no great change in the forward fluency.",
      "Since Man Utd head coach Ruben Amorim was appointed, only one team that has not been relegated or promoted has picked up fewer points than his Red Devils.",
      "Are Man United actually going to be any better this season than last season? They really might not be much better. In which case, Amorim’s in trouble.",
      "Ruben Amorim should brace himself for pelters if Man Utd fail to beat Brentford after social media backlash over three selection calls."

      "Manchester United boss Ruben Amorim has won nine of his 33 games in the Premier League and is yet to record consecutive victories in the competition 10 months into the job. The momentum of victory over Chelsea vanished when his side were beaten at Brentford for a third time in four visits",
      "Saturday 27 September 2025 21:43, UK",
      "Winning two in a row used to mean something different at Manchester United.",
      "Ruben Amorim's side went to Brentford in search of their first back-to-back league wins under him, which tells you all you need to know about the progress made in the 33 games since he took charge.",
      "Amorim described the game as the club's \"most important in a long time\" but his players failed to translate that urgency onto the pitch as they suffered a deflating 3-1 defeat.",
      "Victory over 10-man Chelsea last week was unable to inspire the consistency that will ultimately be required to keep Amorim in a job and they have sunk back into the bottom half of the table. So where does Amorim go from here?",
      "It was once again so obvious that United's set-up was a massive issue at Brentford.",
      "Forget criticism of playing three at the back, others have shown it is no impediment to success. It is Amorim's insistence on leaving his two-man midfield pivot exposed that comes back to bite him time and again.",
      "Brentford changed from a back five to a back four against Amorim's three-at-the-back system, while keeping a midfield three of Jordan Henderson, Yehor Yarmoliuk and Mikkel Damsgaard.",
      "Not for the first time this season, United's midfield pivot of Bruno Fernandes and Manuel Ugarte were overrun by Brentford, who richly deserved the three points.",
      "Amorim did not seem to want to acknowledge those issues after the game. \"It's always the same, when we win it's not the system, when we lose it's the system,\" he said.",
      "So far, we've yet to see Amorim's United dominate a top team in the Premier League that has a full accompaniment of players. After Casemiro's red card last week, Chelsea made United sweat for the win.",
      "Brentford boss Keith Andrews, who was in charge of set pieces in the club's set-up under Thomas Frank last season, explained after the game how his side overloaded United's midfield.",
      "\"It's the natural way you prepare for games,\" said Andrews, when asked if he targeted United's midfield. \"You try and create overloads,\" he added.",
      "\"One of which would be if we have a three-man midfield, they have a two. But you could flip it and say 'if their wide players tuck in, then they have a four'. But I certainly felt how we tried to entice them onto us and try and play around, or through [them], at times, would be on.\"",
      "Andrews, in his first season as a senior head coach, demonstrated the value in adaptability on Saturday, while Amorim finished the game with Mbeumo and Mason Mount as his wing-backs.",
      "Defeat at Brentford means that is exactly where United will start the month after finishing last season 15th in the table despite a spend of more than £200m over the summer on a new strikeforce, who failed to impress on their first outing together at Brentford.",
      "Benjamin Sesko did manage to score his first United goal, though there was little spark between himself, Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo.",
      "\"There's got to be a turnaround pretty quickly, and the manager's idea has got to land very quickly with the players,\" Neville, the former United captain, said at the time.",
      "United's decision-makers are behind Amorim, but another defeat when Sunderland go to Old Trafford next week would ramp up the pressure on the head coach over the international break.",
      "However, Amorim, who has reportedly offered his job up on more than one occasion, says fears about potentially being sacked do not enter his mind.",
      "\"I'm always comfortable with the job,\" Amorim told BBC Sport. \"I've proved that already. I'm not concerned, that is not my decision. I will do the best I can in every minute that I'm here. I'm never concerned for my job, I'm not that kind of guy.\"",
      "Amorim got a message of backing after the Manchester derby defeat. You wonder how many more set-backs he can survive before patience runs thin.",
      "Results are the only thing that can save Amorim and he knows that. His record in the league stands at nine victories in 33 games. That is a win percentage of 27.3 per cent, lower than any other to succeed Sir Alex Ferguson by some distance.",
      "United have made a habit of starting games at a fast pace this season, certainly against Arsenal, Fulham, Burnley and Chelsea. Amorim wants his team to get off to a good start because he knows what happens when they don't.",
      "Each league game this season in which United have conceded the first goal, they have lost.",
      "The pressure cooker of Old Trafford has been too much for most players to sign for the club over the last decade and Amorim is trying to find a way to build confidence in the way his team plays.",
      "He has enjoyed some success with this, at least in United's home games, but at Brentford, there was no sign of the electric start that overcame Chelsea. Without the crowd, the players struggle to cope.",
      "This is reflected by their current eight-game winless run away from home in the league. The last one came in March at Leicester, who were relegated a month later.",
      "Before that, it was at Fulham at the end of January. United were hardly convincing in that game either. Lisandro Martinez's deflected strike just got them over the line.",
      "The mental fragility - and inability to cope without the support of Old Trafford - is a huge hindrance to Amorim's bid to bring consistency back to United.",
      "\"It's like ups and downs,\" said Amorim, when asked about this latest setback.",
      "\"When you win, you feel that everything and that the momentum is here. When you lose, you go back to the same place and fight again for the one win that can help you to create the momentum.",
      "\"I cannot tell you more than I say every time I lose the game. Sometimes you see one team that performs really well and you see improvements, and then sometimes you have some games that you don't see the improvement that gives you the confidence to say that Manchester United is going to get back.",
      "\"It's always the same conversation.\"",
      "Amorim has been in the job for 10 months and is yet to win consecutive games in the league. Momentum feels extremely distant right now."

      "Bruno Fernandes had a penalty saved as Manchester United fell to a 3-1 defeat at Brentford to put the spotlight back on Ruben Amorim as his search for back-to-back league wins continues.",
      "United were 2-1 down as Fernandes waited more than four minutes to take his second-half spot-kick which was eventually saved by Caoimhin Kelleher after VAR checked if Nathan Collins should have been sent off for denying Bryan Mbeumo a goalscoring opportunity.",
      "Referee Craig Pawson's decision to book Collins was upheld, without him being sent to the monitor, despite the Brentford defender making no clear attempt to play the ball when pulling his former team-mate back by the shoulder.",
      "Where a player commits an offence against an opponent within their own penalty area which denies an opponent an obvious goal-scoring opportunity and the referee awards a penalty kick, the offender is cautioned if the offence was an attempt to play the ball or a challenge for the ball.\n\n\nIn all other circumstances (e.g. holding, pulling, pushing, no possibility to play the ball etc.), the offending player must be sent off.",
      "United only have themselves to blame for the result, their third defeat in a four-game winless run at Brentford, that was sealed when Mathias Jensen struck a superb third goal in stoppage-time. All the momentum of the win over Chelsea had vanished.",
      "Brentford were two goals up after 20 minutes thanks to Igor Thaigo's first-half double and, although Benjamin Sesko scored his first goal for the club to halve the deficit six minutes later, United were never convincing in their fight-back.",
      "Fernandes' second failure from the spot this season ultimately cost United, who are now winless in their last eight away league games and back in the bottom half as Brentford climb above them thanks to a richly deserved three points.",
      "Brentford Kelleher (7), Kayode (8), Collins (7) Van den Berg (7), Hickey (7), Henderson (8), Yarmoliuk (8), Ouattara (7), Damsgaard (7), Schade (8), Thiago (9). \n\n\nSubs: Lewis-Potter (6), Henry (6), Onyeka (6), Janelt (6), Jensen (7).\n\n\nMan Utd: Bayindir (6), De Ligt (5), Maguire (5), Shaw (5), Dalot (4), Ugarte (5), Fernandes (4), Dorgu (5),  Mbeumo (5), Sesko (6), Cunha (5).\n\n\nSubs:  Mainoo (6), Yoro (5), Mount (5), ZIrkzee (5).\n\n\nPlayer of the Match: Igor Thiago.",
      "Amorim disagreed with the decision not to send off Collins but said his team should have done more to manage the game after Fernandes failed to convert his penalty.",
      "\"They told me Bryan was not in control of the ball. I think he was not in control of the ball because he was pulled,\" Amorim said in his post-match press conference.",
      "He added: \"Sometimes the decisions are not in your favour. We have the capacity to calm down the game. We didn't do that today.\"",
      "Former Premier League official Mike Dean, speaking on Soccer Saturday, was in agreement: \"For me, it is a red card.\"",
      "Brentford changed from a back five to a back four against Amorim's three at the back system, but head coach Keith Andrews kept his midfield three of Jordan Henderson, Yehor Yarmoliuk and Mikkel Damsgaard.",
      "Not for the first time this season, United's midfield pivot of Fernandes and Manuel Ugarte were outnumbered and overrun by Brentford.",
      "Asked if he felt it was an area to target, Andrews said: \"It's the natural way you prepare for games. You try and create overloads. One of which would be if we have a three-man midfield, they have a two. But you could flip it and say 'if their wide players tuck in then they have a four.",
      "\"But I certainly felt how we tried to entice them onto us and try and play around, or through, at times, would be on. And I felt, going back to it, the players did that with real courage and conviction.\"",
      "On goalscorer Thiago, Andrews added: \"He's getting real rhythm in his game now and confidence in his game. He's shown exactly why the football club brought him here. He's such a powerful player. Very positive individual and very selfless.\"",
      "Winning two in a row used to mean something different at Old Trafford. They came to Brentford in search of the club's first back-to-back league wins under Amorim, but Thiago scored twice in the first 20 minutes before the United players had woken up.",
      "Harry Maguire was culpable for the opener as Jordan Henderson's long ball over the top caught him napping. Thiago was all alone when he hammered in the opener. The whole stadium thought he was offside, only for replays to show Maguire was slow off the mark.",
      "United, losers in every league game in which they have trailed this season, were unable to cope with Brentford, who terrorised their visitors from set-pieces. Altay Bayindir made two fine saves from Henderson and then Collins but was at fault for Thiago's second.",
      "The Brentford striker just had to fire in from close-range after Kevin Schade's cross was spilled by Bayindir in the six-yard box. Thiago needed just six touches to score his two goals, which takes him to five in seven games this season.",
      "This was the first time Amorim had started United's £207m front three of Mbeumo, Sesko and Matheus Cunha but the first impression was not a positive one. Their lack of desire to help in midfield left the pivot of Fernandes and Manuel Ugarte exposed.",
      "Sesko did manage to break his United duck in his fourth start for the club as Patrick Dorgu's hopeful, looping cross eventually found him. It took three goes to beat Kelleher from close-range, the former Liverpool keeper pulling off a couple of fine saves.",
      "Brentford taking their foot off the gas gave United encouragement, though they lacked punch. When the spot-kick was awarded it felt like the piece of luck that Amorim needed to turn his troubled tenure around, but Fernandes let him down.",
      "There was no response from United as Brentford took further encouragement before adding a deserved third in stoppage-time through substitute Jensen. His swerving shot finished centrally to make Bayindir look foolish. He was not the only one.",

      "Barca are delighted with the progress of Rashford and are said to be very enthusiastic about how he is settling into the club and the city. They are also pleased with how he has already endeared himself to the players, staff and fans at the Nou Camp, despite a reprimand for being two minutes late for a recent meeting by head coach Hansi Flick.",
      "On the pitch, he is also delivering. The 27-year-old has two goals and two assists in his last three games.",
      "It remains far too early for Barcelona to discuss the potential of signing him on a permanent basis - but there is no gap in valuation with Manchester United over what that would cost, contrary to reports earlier this week.",

      "Rashford's ability to play as a No 9 may come into the Barca bosses' thinking when they consider whether to extend Lewandowski's deal or look to sign a new permanent centre-forward instead.",
      "Another key issue is Rashford's wages, which Barca are currently covering entirely - making him one of the highest paid players in Spain.",
      "Barca have had to pull financial levers elsewhere in the club in order to register new signings in recent seasons, so paying the permanent option fee and continuing to pay his salary demands is something that will have to come into their long-term financial planning and be subject to LaLiga's spending cap.",
      "Rashford said last week that he wants to play for Barca for \"as many [seasons] as possible\" and \"we will see\" when it comes to a permanent move. \"I have to focus on trying to do my job and trying to help the team in whichever way I can,\" he added.",
      "It will depend on how Rashford performs for the full course of the season, although he has already made a big impact with his two goals against Newcastle in the Champions League and an assist in the thrashing of Valencia.",
      "He is also yet to feel the full support of the Nou Camp because of delays to ongoing refurbishment work at the stadium.",
      "Flick's reprimand for him being late, which was being dropped to the bench, is standard fare under the German's rules and considered water-under-the-bridge at the club. The likes of Raphinha have also had the same treatment for slack punctuality.",

      "United raced into a two-goal lead thanks to goals from Bruno Fernandes and Casemiro following a red card for Robert Sanchez, but the result was thrown into question when the Brazil midfielder picked up his second yellow of the evening.",
      "Trevoh Chalobah pulled a goal back for Chelsea with 10 minutes to go but Amorim's side held on - thanks to a defensive performance that Luke Shaw described as \"desperate\" after the game - to secure a much-needed win.",
      "United headed into the fixture with just four points from as many games, their worst start to a Premier League campaign for 33 years, but pressure will now be momentarily alleviated on Amorim and his squad after what was described by Redknapp as their \"biggest win\" since his appointment in November 2024.",
      "\"This was huge for him today. It got edgy once Casemiro got sent off, you weren't sure they were going to be able to see it out.",
      "\"But Bruno Fernandes was magnificent, second half especially. He carried the fight. It feels like a big occasion but they've got to build on it. They've got to go and win two, three, four games.",
      "\"It was a mad game, I have to be honest. Some of the substitutions, some of the tactical changes. It was hard to keep up with at times. But it was a joy because it was so chaotic.\"",
      "United broke into the top half as a result of their win against Chelsea, with games against Brentford and Sunderland now on the horizon before the October international break.",
      "Speaking after the game, Amorim remained level-headed regarding his team's performance and called for them to create momentum moving forward.",
      "\"I cannot remember a very good play from us, but we pushed our opponent in how aggressive we were in the first and second balls.",
      "\"We cannot have someone sent off near half-time in Casemiro, we like to complicate all our games! But it was a good game.",
      "\"I felt the urgency, especially in the beginning of the game. The sending off helped us. If you remember the first half, we had so many opportunities three against one, three against two.",
      "\"We have to be more clinical to finish the game sooner. With the sending off of Casemiro, you never know what is going to happen so we have to take the chance to kill the game.\"",
      "Pressure had been ramped up on Amorim and his side in the build-up to the visit of Chelsea, which arrived as the following fixture to a dismal 3-0 defeat to local rivals Manchester City.",
      "Speaking after that loss, both Gary Neville and Roy Keane outlined their worries for United, with the former saying a loss to Chelsea would have caused \"big questions\" to be asked of Amorim.",

      "Sunday 21 September 2025 13:08, UK",
      "",
      "All the debate around Bruno Fernandes' position in Ruben Amorim's system after the Manchester derby this week re-opened the conversation around whether Manchester United should have cashed in on their captain over the summer.",
      "The £100m on offer from Saudi Arabia could have been spent re-shaping the midfield, which is so dearly in need of reinforcements. But the message from Amorim was clear: letting Fernandes go at such a pivotal moment in his rebuild would be a terrible decision.",
      "Against Chelsea, Fernandes' value was evident. Not in a tactical sense, but as a leader. In every stage of the game the skipper was pushing his team forward. \"That is the most important thing, the influence he has on the squad,\" Amorim said after the game.",
      "Fernandes showed that he can get into goalscoring positions when playing in a two-man midfield. He grabbed the opening goal, his 100th in United colours, that got the ball rolling against Chelsea. That put everyone at ease and opened the game up.",
      "Amorim is undoubtedly asking a lot of his captain to dictate the game from deep and deliver a threat in the final third, but on Saturday Fernandes rose to the occasion. \"The point of the captain is to be the best he can be in every situation to make the team better,\" added Amorim.",
      "Even when United were wobbling in the closing stages, Fernandes single-handedly led his team up the pitch after dispossessing Reece James and very nearly scored a stunning strike from range before firing up the Stretford End.",
      "Who could Man Utd have signed this summer that would deliver all of this straight away? Many of Amorim's decisions have rightly been questioned but keeping Fernandes was no doubt the right call.Zinny Boswell",
      "Trevoh Chalobah's header briefly gave Chelsea hope at Old Trafford but the one-goal margin of defeat flattered them. Despite Casemiro's red card levelling the playing field before half-time, they only managed five shots worth a meagre 0.39 expected goals.",
      "Their listless performance capped a poor week after drawing with Brentford and losing their Champions League opener to Bayern Munich. It also raised questions of their head coach Enzo Maresca, whose decisions during the game did little to help his side.",
      "First came his call to substitute Pedro Neto as well as Estevao after Robert Sanchez's early red card, leaving Chelsea devoid of any kind of quick outlet. Not long after that, he withdrew Cole Palmer, later explaining he was not fully fit before the game.",
      "Starting a half-fit Palmer only three days after he played 90 minutes in Munich was never likely to end well and his removal, for the more defensively-minded Andrey Santos, further limited his side offensively when they were chasing the game.",
      "Maresca could have called on Alejandro Garnacho, who would surely have been desperate to prove a point against his former side, or the £51.5m Jamie Gittens, but both players finished the game as unused substitutes, with Tyrique George, a player they seemed happy to sell a month ago, preferred in the second half. It was another strange decision from the Chelsea boss in a game full of them.Nick Wright",
      "Graham Potter is a hard man to read. Perhaps he is a better poker player than football manager in that regard.",
      "As he strode into his post-match press conference to address a room of journalists ready to poke and probe him on his West Ham future, you would not have been able to tell if his team had won 6-0 or lost 2-1. His emotionless responses were as predictable as the West Ham defeat.",
      "Remember, football is supposed to be an emotional game, played by emotional people, managed in the most emotionally volatile environments. And that is where Potter keeps falling short.",
      "There is no doubting his coaching credentials. His work at Ostersunds, Brighton and even in patches at Chelsea paints the picture of a tactician who understands the game at a deep level and he is well admired within coaching circles.",
      "His problem is that lack of personality. It is going to hold him back from ever making a success of himself at a big club. It is unlikely now he will get that chance again as his stock continues to fall.Lewis Jones",
      "Last season, this Spurs side embarrassingly collapsed at Brighton, but nearly a year on, they showed real fight to rescue a draw as they appear far more resilient under Thomas Frank.",
      "Having gone 2-0 down after 31 minutes on Saturday, Spurs looked set to suffer their first away defeat under the Dane, but there is a steeliness about this Tottenham side that was not always evident under Ange Postecoglou.",
      "Last October, Spurs went 2-0 up after 37 minutes, but a shocking second-half surrender saw Brighton win 3-2 with Postecoglou labelling it then as his \"worst defeat\" of his tenure.",
      "For Frank, the same venue has provided the opposite feeling as he called the 2-2 draw their \"best performance of the season\".",
      "He had a point with Spurs looking far more threatening than in their midweek Champions League home win over Villarreal.",
      "Frank was also delighted with their \"mentality\" and \"physicality\" in their comeback over Brighton - something they are going to need plenty of with a potential 50-plus game season in store.",
      "Eyebrows were slightly raised when £51m signing Xavi Simons started on the bench, but he came on to great effect in the No 10 role, where surely he will have a much better impact than out on the left-wing.",
      "Another bright spot was left-back Destiny Udogie, whom Frank hailed \"exceptional\" and \"unstoppable\" on his first start of the season.",
      "Udogie was a part of that Spurs side which crumbled on the south coast last season, but in this rescue act he was one to display Frank's pursuit of a tougher and determined Spurs.Declan Olley",
      "After such a dour Fulham performance against Leeds last weekend, it was curious that Marco Silva chose not to pick any of the substitutes - let's be honest, Kevin, who spurred them to victory late on in that game - to start against Brentford.",
      "Maybe that is why he is the Premier League head coach, because after a week of seeing his side on the training ground he was absolutely right to keep faith that they would find their energy and creativity again.",
      "He said this week their ambitions would not be dimmed by a difficult transfer window, with only Aston Villa spending less, but resources do make a difference.",
      "This was a timely reminder of the talent that remains at Craven Cottage, and that was without their tricky new Brazilian, or fellow new arrival Samuel Chukwueze who was an unused substitute.",
      "Special credit to Josh King, who was unusually quiet in his last game and gave away Brentford's opener in this one, but went on to drive the hosts forward before he was withdrawn.",
      "Silva said he was \"impressed, but not surprised\" by the 18-year-old's maturity, and the way he refused to hide despite such an unfortunate error was a credit to the teenager.",
      "Little surprise he was handed a standing ovation when he eventually made way for the Brazilian. It almost warrants a double take that this was just his 20th senior appearance.Ron Walker",
      "Wolves have always been slow starters. They have lost nine out of their last 10 matches and they have conceded a double-digit goal tally in each of the last three seasons. But this feels different - and not in a good way.",
      "Wolves look sloppy at both ends of the pitch. Only West Ham have conceded more goals than them while they have a Premier League-high of errors leading to goals this season.",
      "Meanwhile, their attacking credentials were summed up on Saturday by having three times more of expected goals than Leeds, who in turn managed three times more actual goals than them.",
      "Losing Nelson Semedo, Rayan Ait-Nouri, Pablo Sarabia and Matheus Cunha in one summer would cause that. Wolves are not just missing the quality the quartet bring, but also the experience of these situations.",
      "Wolves also appear to have tied their own hands in tying Vitor Pereira down to a new deal this week. It makes a change of direction much harder, as pulling the plug on Pereira would then create further questions about the club's decision makers.",
      "So Wolves are not just slow starters, they are stuck and standing still.Sam Blitz",
      "Three summer signings got on the scoresheet for Leeds at Wolves and all stole the show in their different ways.",
      "Dominic Calvert-Lewin's first Premier League goal since January was a throwback to his best self - not only grabbing Leeds' equaliser but leading the line with solid build-up play.",
      "Anton Stach's brilliant free-kick was the moment of the match. The German midfielder came into the weekend as the only Premier League player with at least 10 shots and 10 chances created - and he will join Calvert-Lewin in producing attacking creativity to make Daniel Farke's side dangerous.",
      "But the standout player was Noah Okafor, whose third goal was so well deserved after an industrious performance down the left.",
      "The winger attempted an incredible 14 dribbles - 12 of them coming before half-time. That dozen was already the most out of any Premier League player in a single match all season, and his aggressive and clinical display epitomised their overall display.",
      "A lot of Leeds' summer signings had one thing in common: six foot or above. Farke even admitted they had been brought in with physicality and even set-pieces in mind.",
      "But Leeds have showed something different: they have actual Premier League quality capable of keeping them up.Sam Blitz",
      "Ange Postecoglou says Nottingham Forest are \"responding\" to what he wants them to do, despite his side being winless since he replaced Nuno Espirito Santo.",
      "The worrying thing for him is that Forest are beginning to inherit some good things from Postcoglou but they are also taking on his downsides.",
      "Postecoglou is winless in his last nine Premier League games and that stretches back into the latter days at Tottenham. It is his longest run without a league win as a top-flight manager across spells in Australia, Japan, Scotland and England.",
      "Forest started strongly and quickly, which earned them a much-deserved second-minute opener. The intensity was there. But the almost kamikaze nature of their play allowed Burnley back into the game, ceding control with Scott Parker's side looking the more likely. Burnley's equaliser in the 20th minute was a deserved one, and their display from that point merited at least one more with the chances they created.",
      "It is those periods that Postecoglou failed to manage during his Spurs days and similar patterns are emerging. Postecoglou needs to buck that trend if he is to find any success at the City Ground.William Bitibiri",
      "In a Premier League where we obsess with big names, big budgets and big personalities, Oliver Glasner is crafting something special - something clever - at Crystal Palace.",
      "He is one that embraces the marginal gains. If there is one manager in the Premier League who embodies that philosophy to the letter, it is Glasner.",
      "The win at West Ham was the perfect case in point where Palace exposed West Ham's fragilities at set-pieces. Glasner's team scored one and created two other big chances from such scenarios and he was very open in his post-match presser about how he knew he could expose a psychological weakness in the West Ham ranks.",
      "He said: \"I played over 19 years as a defender and you have periods sometimes where you can concede many set-piece goals. This makes you nervous. It's natural, we're all human beings and even if you don't want it to be there, this just happens. We talked about it. It was good to have many set-plays.\"",

      "Sunday 21 September 2025 07:20, UK",
      "Manchester United eased the pressure on head coach Ruben Amorim as they held on to beat Chelsea 2-1 in a frantic encounter which saw both sides down to 10 men.",
      "United made a blistering start and caught Chelsea cold in the pouring Old Trafford rain as Robert Sanchez was sent off after five minutes for chopping down Bryan Mbeumo. Goals from Bruno Fernandes and Casemiro then put United firmly in control heading into the break.",
      "However, Casemiro had levelled the playing field when he was shown a second yellow for bringing down Andrey Santos in first-half stoppage-time. Chelsea pulled a late goal back through Trevoh Chalobah but failed to truly take advantage of the opening to extend their nearly 13-year winless run at Old Trafford.",
      "United threatened to collapse but pulled through to secure Amorim's first back-to-back Premier League home wins since taking charge. The second-half performance was unconvincing, but the three points will create some breathing space for now.",
      "Man Utd:  Bayindir (6); De Ligt (7), Maguire (7), Shaw (7); Mazraoui (7), Casemiro (6), Fernandes (8), Dorgu (7); Mbeumo (8), Sesko (6), Amad (7).\n\n\nSubs:  Ugarte (6), Cunha (6), Mount (6) Yoro (6), Mainoo (N/A).\n\n\nChelsea:  Sanchez (1); James (5), Fofana (4), Chalobah (6), Cucurella (5); Fernandez (5), Caicedo (6), Palmer (4); Neto (4), Joao Pedro (6), Estevao (4).\n\n\nSubs:  Jorgensen (6), Tosin (5), Andrey Santos (6), Gusto (5), George (5). \n\n\nPlayer of the Match:  Bruno Fernandes (Man Utd).",
      "Amorim asked for more aggression this week and his players responded emphatically as they overawed Chelsea in the first half. Sanchez's red was the earliest Chelsea had ever had a player sent off and it told. They were shellshocked.",
      "It was the captain Fernandes who eventually got the ball rolling for United with his 100th goal for the club in his 200th Premier League appearance.",
      "After all the debate around Fernandes' position in Amorim's system and whether it gives him enough license to get forward, the midfielder poked in a poacher's finish to open the scoring after Patrick Dorgu's header across goal.",
      "Chelsea were all at sea by then and Enzo Maresca took evasive action to try and prevent the slide after Sanchez's red card, making three substitutions with just 21 minutes on the clock, the earliest a manager has ever done so in the Premier League.",
      "Cole Palmer was a surprise sacrifice for Chelsea, but it later became apparent that the groin issue he had supposedly shaken off after defeat at Bayern Munich on Wednesday in the Champions League was still bothering him.",
      "Casemiro doubled United's lead toward the end of the half thanks to a botched clearance from Reece James that allowed Luke Shaw to overpower Wesley Fofana and head the ball to the back post for the Brazilian to nod in.",
      "His inexplicable decision to pull down Andrey Santos less than 10 minutes later opened the door for Chelsea. Casemiro shook his head after being shown red, as if he had been hard done by, but he should never have given Peter Bankes a decision to make with the game all but won.",
      "Chelsea did not register a single shot on target until Chalobah headed in at the back post from James' cross with 10 minutes to go. United had gone into their shells, fearing a late comeback, but there was not enough conviction from the visitors to capitalise on the wobble.",
      "Alejandro Garnacho did not get the Old Trafford return he would have hoped for as he was booed by the home fans and denied the opportunity to enter the fray by a late injury to Fofana which used up Chelsea's final substitution.",
      "Maresca's side return to west London after a sobering week: a draw at Brentford followed by defeats in Munich and Manchester. Chelsea are just one point ahead of United in the table after five games.",
      "\"Every three points is massive in this moment because we haven't started the season as we wanted. But we go game by game. Today was massive and the next one will be massive too.",
      "\"Every goal is important. It doesn't matter the moment. A big moment for me, reaching that milestone for a massive club. I'm very happy, I won't hide from that, but it wasn't something I was trying to achieve when I came to the club. It was about trying to do the best I could and obviously if I can get more goals to help the team win games, that is what matters the most.",
      "\"We were more sit back, try not to concede goals, not let them play through the lines as they have a lot of players who like to drop to play. It was about pushing them to the sides to cross the ball, as we had big players. We still conceded the goal from the corner, but we defended very well. We got the result we wanted in the end.\"",
      "\"This is Amorim's biggest result as Manchester United manager, certainly at home. This was huge for him today. It got edgy once Casemiro got sent off, you weren't sure they were going to be able to see it out.",
      "\"But Bruno Fernandes was magnificent, second half especially. He carried the fight. It feels like a big occasion but they've got to build on it. They've got to go and win two, three, four games.",
      "\"It was a mad game, I have to be honest. Some of the substitutions, some of the tactical changes. It was hard to keep up with at times. But it was a joy because it was so chaotic.\"",
      "\"Really good. Now it's time to create a bit of momentum. We started the game really well, really aggressive. I cannot remember a very good play from us, but we pushed our opponent in how aggressive we were in the first and second balls. We cannot have someone sent off near half-time in Casemiro, we like to complicate all our games! But it was a good game.",
      "\"I felt the urgency, especially in the beginning of the game. The sending off helped us. If you remember the first half, we had so many opportunities three against one, three against two. We have to be more clinical to finish the game sooner. With the sending off of Casemiro, you never know what is going to happen so we have to take the chance to kill the game.\"",
      "\"Very difficult because after three or four minutes with the red card, it completely changed the game. All the plan is in the bin. So it was very complicated.",
      "\"[Sanchez's red card is] a situation that we can avoid because we knew these kind of long balls for Benjamin Sesko, they try to flick for Mbeumo. We knew that. Unfortunately we conceded that moment. When you are one player down, it becomes completely difficult and changed the game.\"",
      "Explaining his decision to make three changes after the red card, Maresca added: \"They are used to attacking with five players, so in that moment we have to defend with five players. We can defend absolutely with four when we are 11 vs 11, but when we are one player down, the idea was to defend with five.",
      "\"We decided to change with Estevao and Pedro Neto and the after we changed Cole because he made an effort to play this game because he was not 100 per cent fit. This morning he had a test and he was OK but not 100 per cent fit. So we decided to change him after 20 minutes.\"",
      "\"We have to look at ourselves as players. It wasn't good enough for ourselves, for the club. The first 15 minutes is the worst we've played this season. We have to reflect on that as a team and learn from this.",
      "\"With the red card that happens, you go 2-0 down in the game, any team you play against, it's always difficult coming back. We struggled in the first half.",
      "\"It's always difficult going down to 10 men and you can see that United were up for it. They put us under pressure. It wasn't good enough at our end. We couldn't get going in the first half.",
      "\"Things like this happen in the season. We can't say we're kids anymore, we've played in the Premier League long enough now. We have just got to learn from this and move forward.",
