      "In recent years, Manchester United have had their fair share of transfer mishaps - and letting Scott McTominay is leave is looking like one of the worst. Since joining Napoli last summer, the Scotland international has lit up the Diego Armando Maradona Stadium with his energy, grit and goals, becoming a driving force behind the club's Serie A title push.",
      "Despite being one of United's more consistent performers during a turbulent period, McTominay was never truly celebrated at Old Trafford. That isn't the case in Naples, where the fans have rallied around him, nicknaming him 'McFratm' - a blend of his surname and the local word 'fratm', meaning 'bro'.",
      "Another moniker he's earned, 'The Bottle Opener', speaks to his knack for delivering breakthrough goals when they're most needed. But it isn't just his popularity that's surged - his market value has too.",
      "Napoli snapped him up for £25million, but his estimated value now sits at €40m (£34m), according to Transfermarkt. This rise is especially striking given his age of 28, and that his highest valuation at United topped out at £29m - offering yet another indicator of the club's inability to recognise what they had.",
      "Italian football icon Massimo Ambrosini has credited Napoli boss Antonio Conte with unlocking McTominay's full potential. \"His value has only gone up since he left Manchester United and the reason for that is Antonio Conte,\" he told JeffBet.",
      "\"Conte has created a team that gets the best out of his players and McTominay is perfect in the middle behind Romelu Lukaku. His value has definitely increased this season and I think that is down to the manager.\"",
      "With 12 goals in 33 matches - including 11 in the league - McTominay has been a major influence on Napoli's campaign. Holding a three-point lead atop the table, they're in a strong position to finish the season as champions if they maintain composure in their final trio of games.",
      "McTominay has delivered time and again with his performances and particularly with his goals, whether breaking the deadlock, equalising, or sealing victories. \"Scott is a complete player,\" Conte said back in September. \"He's versatile, who can be a trequartista behind the striker, he can be a mezzala in a three-man midfield, play in a two-man midfield or even wide in a 5-4-1 with licence to attack.\"",
      "More recently, Conte claimed that United consistently deployed McTominay poorly, failing to recognise what his true qualities were. \"He never had a main role at United that instead we have given him here,\" the coach said. \"He has grown a lot by working. Today he is [a] complete [player].\"",
      "Should Napoli finish the season as champions, it would mark only their second title since the Maradona era and just the fourth in their history. Their emotional 2022/23 triumph, led by superstar attackers Victor Osimhen and Khvicha Kvaratskhelia, ended a more than 30-year wait.",
      "With both players having moved on, winning again this season would be a stunning feat. And with McTominay emerging as a new leader, Napoli may have found the next piece in their legacy-building puzzle - proof that great players don't always come with great fanfare."

      "Micky van de Ven insists Tottenham have \"nothing to fear\" against Manchester United in the Europa League final. The imperious Dutchman, who marshalled the Spurs defence to a second successive European away clean sheet in Norway against Bodo/Glimt, said of Ruben Amorim's side: \"They played Athletic Club, a really good team and it was 7-1 over the two games. \"So they've also shown some real quality in Europe. We knew it's going to be a different game, everything can happen in a final but we're not going there with fear, of course. \"We know our qualities, we know it's going to be a difficult game as Man United have also shown their quality in this European campaign.\"",
      "Tottenham are bidding to end their 17-year wait for silverware, however, it's also been 41 years since they last lifted a European trophy (UEFA Cup). Van de Ven is confident Ange Postecoglou's troops can now finally end that hoodoo by finishing a difficult season on the greatest of highs. He continued: \"Everybody goes to Bilbao to win a trophy. It has been a tough season and it will only be successful if we win the Europa League and get that trophy. \"To be in a European final with Tottenham is a big thing for the fans, the club and me personally, I'm really proud to be part of it. Van de Ven, who only played 135 minutes of Spurs' group campaign due to a hamstring injury, starred alongside influential captain Cristian Romero in Thursday's gritty victory inside the Arctic Circle. He paid tribute to the indispensable Argentine, hailing a captain's performance in the absence of injured skipper Heung-min Son.",
      "The 24-year-old said: \"Cuti's an unbelievable player. You can see that mentality wise. With the ball, without the ball, he knows how it is to play these types of games. \"You can see it in how he is, he shows so much to the rest, he helps the whole team. My partnership with Cuti we feel each other, he knows what to do, I know what to do, we back each other.\" Dominic Solanke, who netted in both legs of the semi-final, has warned his team-mates they cannot get trapped into thinking they have United's number - just because they've beaten them three times already this season. When asked if those victories can give Spurs confidence, he said: “Yeah, a little bit, but obviously it’s going to be a completely different game, different circumstances. “Finals are never easy. We’re both in the final for a reason, we’ve both done well in Europe, so we know it’s going to be a difficult game. Pressure is a privilege, when you’re at big clubs, you always want to be fighting for silverware\""

      "After his brilliant 2023-24 season with Lille, there was not a major European club without an interest in Leny Yoro. But with the teenage defender’s contract expiring in the summer of 2025, he bore all the hallmarks of a Real Madrid free transfer target.",
      "He ticked an awful lot of Bernabeu boxes. But Manchester United and INEOS acted decisively, knowing it would take big money - both in terms of transfer fee and salary - to tempt Yoro to Old Trafford.",
      "But in the form of a £52million fee and a five-year deal that started at £150,000 for an 18-year-old defender, they tabled big money. A pre-season injury was part of an unfortunate start to Yoro’s United career and he was hardly convincing in his early games for Ruben Amorim.",
      "But there are signs that Yoro, now 19, might just represent a rarity … an INEOS masterstroke. In his recent performances, he has been consistently good and was outstanding in the 4-1 win over Athletic Bilbao in the Europa League semi-final second leg at Old Trafford.",
      "From the time he was repeatedly skinned by Southampton’s Kamaldeen Sulemana back in January, it was clear that Yoro’s defensive approach is not based on raw speed. Instead, he is proving to be a fine reader of a game, astute with his interventions and an intelligent distributor of the ball.",
      "Remember any United centre-halves with that skill set? Yes - and it is no surprise Yoro has been picking his brains.",
      "“I speak a lot with the coach and I’ve spoken to Rio (Ferdinand) and not always in front of the cameras,” says Yoro. “Sometimes, they just give me advice. When a player like Rio can give you advice, then you need to take it.”",
      "And as the comparisons to Ferdinand began to be taken a touch more seriously, it is clear to see they are giving the young French defender a lift. He goes on: “Of course I come to Man United to achieve big things, to win trophies.",
      "\"So, when you see players like Rio Ferdinand, (Nemanja) Vidic and (Raphael) Varane, you want to achieve the same things as them, you want to stay in the memory of fans and be a big defender. When they compare me to them it’s a real honour, I’m proud of this.”",
      "An odd report from Spain last week suggested his camp were exploring the possibility of getting him to Real Madrid after United's disappointing Premier League campaign. But Yoro looks like a player who is beginning to revel in the challenge facing United players of this era.",
      "He says: “It was difficult for me in the beginning with the injury and even with my performances on the pitch when I first returned but now I’m 100 percent, I am starting to be good and I hope to be like that until the end of the season and into next season. I feel confident.”",
      "And looking ahead to the Europa League final against Spurs, Yoro is, of course, determined to start his United medal collection, declaring: “This is a club of trophies. When you play for Manchester United you need to feel this. We are Manchester United and we need to win trophies.”"

Although Amorim will rotate his squad for Sunday's visit of West Ham to Old Trafford, the United boss said he needs his big players to be sharp for the final in Bilbao on May 21.",
      "Skipper Bruno Fernandes, defenders Harry Maguire and Noussair Mazraoui, midfielder Casemiro and winger Alejandro Garnacho will all be taken out of Sunday's starting line-up. But they will all feature before the final against Spurs, because Amorim acknowledged they cannot afford to go into such a huge game cold, without match sharpness and rhythm.",
      "“No, they will play, because sometimes it's better to play,” said Amorim. “What I will protect is those players who can get an injury. The last game before Tottenham, away to Chelsea, was moved to Friday, so we will have time to recover.",
      "“Bruno doesn't have the problem of any injury, but Harry has, so we will have to manage that. But they have to play and it's better to play than to stay out.”",

      "“That's a good thing, not just for the final, but also to prepare for the games of the Premier League, with something in our minds that we can win. It's going to be massive.",
      "“I think it's a good thing for the players that we will not have a lot of training sessions. They will fight for their places in the final in these next two games. Against Brentford, we made some mistakes and I felt that some of our players were thinking about this game [against Bilbao].”",
      "United have three Premier League games left this season and while Amorim said he must rest some key players, he acknowledged the need to select a team capable of winning in the league.",
      "“We have to acknowledge that we are Manchester United,” said Amorim. “We need to win games also in the Premier League. We have to use every game to improve, even to prepare for the final, but especially to prepare for the future.",

      "A former hooligan recalled risking his life on a brutal away day where he claimed ambushing fans were armed with bricks and Stanley knives. Tony O’Neill was once regarded as Britain’s most notorious football hooligan. Back in the 1970s, he became a key figure in two Manchester United firms, Red Army and later the Casuals, and hewas known as ‘the general’.",
      "But on April 23, 1974, he travelled to Merseyside when he was just 15 to watch a soon to be relegated United take on Everton at Goodison Park. And speaking on his Webby & O’Neill YouTube channel for his ‘Fan Culture' series, he spoke about the chaos that unfolded.",
      "His mum initially forbade him from going but eventually he joined up with The Red Army who made their way to Liverpool.",
      "He said people had been speaking about the game for weeks. Tony remembered: “We knew what we was up against. This was going to be war. And I mean war. We were going to take on the scousers.”",
      "He said hundreds of United fans packed the trains before arriving at Lime Street Station where trouble immediately broke out. Tony said the group stood their ground before being welcomed by bricks once they started to make their way to the football stadium.",
      "“Bricks came flying over at us while we were on the march,” he said. “What a solid march, but a frightening walk if you were on your own or in small groups. But not this gang, this gang was massive and it was solid. There was no moving it.”",
      "He said this was a victory for the firm but the real violence took place after the match where Everton came out 1-0 winners in what was a night game.",
      "“I was depressed because I knew we were going down,” Tony recalled. “But we knew what we had to do. The gates open and we have got to be at the front. We knew the rules going there. This has always been the motto, go out there and whatever happens, happens. Take it to them. Don’t go hiding, don’t be sneaking off, especially in Merseyside.”",
      "Fights broke out outside Goodison Park but disputes between United fans took place where some wanted to get on coaches back to Lime Street and others wanted to march back.",
      "Tony was one of the ones who walked and he said it was “absolutely stupid” and the \"daftest thing you can do in the dark at Merseyside”. “You are going taking your life in your hands,” he added.",
      "Despite knowing he was going to get ambushed, Tony and the now smaller mob reached the end of Stanley Park, and that’s when the real danger commenced.",
      "“That was the nightmare of all nightmares,” he recalled. “They all were Liverpool fans. They just come screaming down the side street, straight into us.",
      "“Oh my God, I just bottled it. What is going on here? This is a nightmare. They had the street and they were running down it straight into us and people just bottled it straight away.",
      "“There is no disgrace in it whatsoever, you were outnumbered, in the dark, you were ambushed. And they caught us. I just legged it straight down.”",
      "He added: “I didn’t look behind me to see what is going on because this is now your life and you also know you are getting robbed, you are getting slashed, you are getting beat up, you are getting done in, there is no mercy here. They were out to get you and they were everywhere. I just kept running and didn’t look back. It is every man for himself.”",
      "Asked to elaborate on Stanley knives being present, he added: “Everyone was up for a fight, that’s what was happening up and down the country. But these took it to a different level and that was what you were fearful of.”",
      "Running for his life, Tony said bricks rained down on him, and at one point his shoe fell off, forcing him to kneel down while his two pals sprinted away.",
      "He described being “so relieved” to get back to Lime Station unharmed, calling it the longest run of his life. “I got away with my life, and I mean got away with my life,” he said.",
      "Speaking about the atmosphere on the train back, he said: “We were all made up. This is the blueprint of how we are going to go to Liverpool or Everton in the future. We knew we could take it to them - it just needed a little more organising.”",
      "Tony, now the author of Red Army General and The Men in Black, then said within 18 months to two years, Manchester United became the main firm in the country. The former hardman now lives a very different life, and in 2017, he started working at Gary Neville’s and Ryan Giggs’ Hotel Football.",
      "He was handpicked by Neville to work security and speaking about his role, he once said: “I’ve stopped going to games. Me and my wife Debbie do the rooftop at Hotel Football on a match day.",
      "“The whole idea is to make it about the supporters’ clubs. The Hotel is a four-star, but the intention of the hotel was to be where the fans could mix.",
      "“The whole idea was to make it accessible, near Old Trafford, for the fans. I get the supporters clubs in. I get the right people in. People love to mix and see proper United fans.”"

      "Athletic Bilbao star Benat Prados has called out Manchester United defender Victor Lindelof and referee Daniel Siebert that forced him to be substituted during Thursday's Europa League semi-final.",
      "Prados was introduced off the bench after 62 minutes, with Bilbao leading 1-0 on the night, though trailing 3-1 on aggregate. But just five minutes after he came on, the midfielder was the victim of a poor tackle from Lindelof.",
      "The Bilbao man had backheeled the ball, with Lindelof jumping in to tackle him off his feet. The Swedish defender planted his foot studs up into Prados' leg, leaving the Spaniard needing treatment.",
      "Referee Siebert opted against showing Lindelof either a yellow or a red card. And the Video Assistant Referee backed that decision, with the United star escaping without any punishment.",
      "Prados was able to carry on, though was clearly struggling, and Mason Mount soon equalised for United. Just a minute after that goal, the midfielder was forced off, with the Bilbao star now hitting out.",
      "He posted a photo on Instagram of his bleeding leg, along with the caption: \"There was no red card. There was no yellow card. There was no foul. Play on...\"",
      "United would go on to score three more times to book their place in the Europa League final. Prados meanwhile is set to undergo further medical tests before he is cleared to return to action.",
      "A statement from Bilbao read: \"Beñat Prados suffered a hard tackle that was not sanctioned by the referee and caused him an incised-contuse injury to the front of his right leg. He is awaiting further treatment.\"",
      "Bilbao boss Ernesto Valverde also pointed to Lindelof's tackle in his post-match press conference. The Spaniard did admit though that his side had not been up to scratch.",
      "\"He [Prados] has a very hard blow to his tibia and a deep wound, we'll have to run tests to see how he's doing,\" Valverde said. \"You have to keep in mind that games last 90 minutes and you have to go all the way against teams that won't forgive you.",
      "\"We kept them in the box and pushed to get into the tie and get into the places we've wanted all season, but we did a lot of things wrong in the last 15 minutes. It seems like the tie has been a walkover, but it hasn't.",
      "“The excitement for the final was there from the start, and we played a great match. At certain moments, against such strong teams, you can't concede anything, and we did. In the first leg, we were there to win, and they were overwhelming.",
      "\"Eliminations are painful, but only one team wins the cup. In La Liga, we still have important challenges to achieve. We want to stay fourth because we want to play in the Champions League next season.\""

      "Gary Neville claims the glory of claiming the Europa League has been diminished - with teams only seeing it as route into the Champions League. Tottenham and Manchester United will contest the final in a matter of weeks, but all the talk is of securing a spot at Europe's top table.",
      "Their exploits in the Europa League have covered for dire Premier League campaigns for both teams. The Manchester outfit and Tottenham will both finish in bottom half of the table, yet could be one of the six English teams in next season's Premier League.",
      "Arsene Wenger recently angered both Spurs and United fans, when came out and suggested that the winners of the Europa League should not be granted a route into the Champions League. Instead, he suggested winners should handed a chance to defend their title if they hadn't qualified automatically.",
      "Roy Keane was in full agreement with Neville also claiming the ex-Arsenal manager had a valid point with all the talk surrounding the Europa League centring on the possibility of Champions League revenue - not the chance to win a historic trophy.",
      "He said: \"Arsene Wenger said no they should qualify automatically for the Europa League again but not necessarily for the Champions League. Especially when you're in the Premier League where already five teams qualify.",
      "Keane quickly responded and said: \"I agree with that. I think it's spot on. To have five or six teams.. It's called a Champions League.\" The Irishman also added: \"I think that's kind of the incentive for smaller teams, they could get in through the back door. But Man Utd lose loads of games last year, losing loads of games this year. Spurs are the same.\"",
      "Of the last five winners only Sevilla in 2020 and Atalanta last year won the Europa League but also qualified for the Champions League in their own right following their league performances. Frankfurt in 2022 and Sevilla the following year both landed Champions League spots despite finishing in the bottom half that season.",
      "Neville underlined the fact that the landing Europa League, formerly the UEFA Cup, was once seen as a huge achievement but is now secondary to the financial implications involved.",
      "\"I do actually agree a little bit with Arsene Wenger,\" he said. \"Every game we watch at the minute we just talk about the money at stakes. No one is talking about winning the Europa League to win a trophy.",
      "\"UEFA Cup and Cup Winners' Cup used to be big trophies that club could win. Now, the first thing you hear is 'yeah you get the Champions League, it's a £60m game'. The Fa Cup has become devalued, really great competitions have become devalued.\""

Neville, who bought out the stake of former co-owner Peter Lim last year, has been involved with the Ammies since 2014 alongside fellow 'Class of 92' members, Nicky Butt, Ryan Giggs, Phil Neville and Paul Scholes.",

The other ‘Class of 92’ members have sold their shares but remain involved with the club.",
      "Beckham has already spoken about Salford rising up through the leagues like Wrexham have done under Ryan Reynolds and Rob McElhenney. Beckham told The Athletic: “We want Salford to be successful and we have had success, but then we want it to go on to the next level.",
      "“I always dream big so I’m always going to want us to get to the pinnacle of football and be in the Premier League. But there’s a lot of hard work and a lot of investment to be done up until that point.”",

      "“They've got a window of opportunity because they've seen what Wrexham have done,” he added. “They've seen the value of star power, and that value of star power has given revenues to Wrexham via Ryan Reynolds and the other fella. That's given them the resources to punch their way into the Championship.”",

But in the instance of Salford, it will be interesting… they’ve seen the Wrexham model. They should be saying, ‘Why can’t it be us?’”",
      "Beckham has also revealed that he wants to lead Salford to the Premier League. He told The Athletic: “We’re definitely not doing it for a laugh and it’s also not for the romantic side of things. Yes, we care about the club but we’re doing it to win.",

      "It marked his third game in a row on the scoresheet, having fired in a stunning volley from the edge of the box in the first leg to give his side a 2-1 lead heading to Florence. And with the tie hanging in the balance at 3-3 on aggregate, he proved the hero of the tie once more by setting up Abde Ezzalzouli with a squared pass for an extra-time winner.",

      "Antony was talking about his extremely difficult two-and-a-half years in Manchester, having been bought for an eye-watering sum in the summer of 2022 which put pressure on him from the outset.

      "“It's important to score goals and provide assists but for me what's most important is sleeping peacefully knowing how I'm doing with myself and being well and happy.

      "After Mason Mount had rubber-stamped Manchester United’s passage to the Europa League final with his first goal of the night, he stood in front of the Stretford End and cupped his ear. Maybe he was making a reference to the talk that he was the sort of expensive signing that symbolises the club’s failings in recent years.",
      "Or maybe, after the frustration brought on by his painful struggles with injury, he just wanted to hear the acclaim that signified a rare positive step in his Old Trafford career. Or maybe he was cheekily asking the crowd to show proper appreciation for the one moment of elite-class skill that turned a fairly mediocre United performance into a glorious procession to the final.",
      "Never mind that Casemiro, Rasmus Hojlund .and Mount again would make it a crushing United victory on the night, it was Mount’s sublime turn and finish just under 20 minutes from the end that was the pivotal moment in a game that had been run by Athletic for a good hour or so.",
      "Quite frankly, United were pretty abysmal until Mount struck with an individual effort that was a reminder of why so many top coaches down the years have adored this wonderful footballer. And after that, Athletic went to pieces, as they had done in Bilbao.",
      "But for half an hour, there was not even a suggestion United might add to their three-goal advantage and the Bilbao breakthrough was hardly a surprise. But the mistake that gave the half-chance to Mikel Jauregizar was a surprise, coming, as it did, from Harry Maguire.",
      "The misplaced pass still looked unlikely to be too damaging but Jauregizar struck his effort nicely enough to beat Andre Onana’s delayed take-off. At least it gave United a nudge of urgency and they would have been level just before the break had Alejandro Garnacho not once again shown that he can be a scorer of great goals rather than a great goalscorer.",
      "Occasionally doing the spectacular is great, frequently doing the routine is better. And it should have been a routine finish when Patrick Dorgu put him in the clear but his attempt to send a chip over Julen Agirrezabala went badly awry.",
      "The miss meant a pervading sense of anxiety remained and that is why, just after the hour mark, Ruben Amorim opted for a triple change of personnel - Mount, Luke Shaw and Amad Diallo all entering the fray. The alterations had the desired effect, to say the least.",
      "And after Mount’s brilliance and Casemiro’s quick-thinking finish, Diallo’s directness enabled him to set up Rasmus Hojlund, who, literally, only had to let the assist hit his foot to get on the scoresheet. Three-one and even Hojlund scored.",
      "Whether or not it was worthy of a celebratory selfie is open for debate but the man who should have been posing for photos finished the job in quite remarkable fashion. When a clearance reached Mount just inside the Athletic half he responded with a first-time, left-footed hit that must have travelled a good 50 yards or so.",
      "Both of Mount’s goals were a measure of a talent that, for reasons beyond the player’s control, Old Trafford has yet to enjoy. Here, that talent has made sure United have an endgame of a European final … but for Mount himself, this will, hopefully, be a new beginning."

      "Tottenham have won the Uefa Cup twice. They have reached a Champions League final much more recently than United. As easy as some find it to deride Spurs, they are a bigger club than some that will finish in the top five of the Premier League and they boast European pedigree.",
      "United, for such a storied club, should have more European honours than the five they celebrated with their first tifo before the quarter-final tie with Lyon. We enter and exit the Old Trafford media centre via the Munich tunnel, a reminder not just of the tragedy that decimated the club in 1958 but the trailblazer that Sir Matt Busby and his Babes were when they embraced the European Cup competition.",
      "Leaving last night, a young fan asked about the final. It is a fascinating dynamic. Amorim admitted - with a chuckle - he and Ange Postecoglou are both \"struggling\". Spurs have won four and drawn one against United under Postecoglou.",
      "\"But they're bottlers,\" the lad wryly added. One cannot argue with that. Since Spurs beat Chelsea in the 2008 League Cup final, they have lost finals in 2009, 2015, 2019 and 2021. 'Spursy' entered the football lexicon some time ago.",
      "Many are banking on United's mettle, disregarding their recent record against Spurs. \"Every game has its history,\" Amorim said. \"We lost the three last games, we can win this one, so if you look at the loss, we are closer to win than to lose.",
      "\"Both teams are going to play all or nothing. The position of the coach is quite similar. I know Ange has one more year (on his contract), it is different, the context, but we are struggling, both of us! I don’t know what is going to happen, it’s a good thing and a bad thing with this team, I never know!\"",
      "Postecoglou is 90 minutes away from making good on his pledge that \"I always win things in my second year\". The final is expected to be his last match in charge of Spurs. Looking from the outside, that inevitability seems to have emboldened him to ensure he leaves on a high Tottenham have not experienced in 17 years.",
      "Objectively, Spurs edge United in most areas. Guglielmo Vicario has been a better goalie than Andre Onana since they stepped foot on these shores from Europe's boot. Pedro Porro and Destiny Udogie trump Diogo Dalot and Patrick Dorgu. Micky van de Ven is one of the Premier League's best centre halves when fit. They have more technically rounded midfielders than United and Dominic Solanke is a more reliable marksman than Rasmus Hojlund.",
      "But we come back to Sir Alex Ferguson's most famous team talk: lads, it's Tottenham. United's Europa League record is daunting: 16 games, nine wins, five draws, no defeats and 35 goals scored. In the six knockout ties, United plundered 19 goals while their Premier League goal difference sank towards minus double figures.",
      "United also have greater depth. Athletic Bilbao petered out quicker than the pyrotechnic smoke after Amad, Mason Mount and Kobbie Mainoo were introduced on Thursday night. Spurs are certain to be without Lucas Bergvall and James Maddison in Bilbao.",
      "Amorim should dismiss United's 3-0 humbling by Tottenham in September. Erik ten Hag was still clinging on and United's season was an extension of last season. Nothing was going to change until they changed the manager.",
      "The madcap League Cup tie in December is hardly relevant, either. United had Altay Bayindir, Antony and Christian Eriksen in their starting XI. Bayindir was not even the worst 'keeper on the pitch, with the cumbersome Fraser Forster up the other end.",
      "As for the 1-0 league loss in February, United were so depleted that Victor Lindelof was the bench's babysitter. Eight of the nine substitutes had never played for the club at the time. The only substitution Amorim made, a debut for Chido Obi, was in the 89th minute.",
      "It is a quirk of fate that United could win their second Europa League under a second Portuguese manager. Amorim and Jose Mourinho are the only United managers to reach a European final in their first season.",
      "Mourinho, of course, also managed Spurs and guided them to their last final in 2021. He was sacked six days before Spurs surrendered to City with Ryan Mason in the dugout for his first match in management.",
      "Of all his sackings, Mourinho told his former player John Obi Mikel that \"the most ridiculous one was a club that has an empty trophy room [and] sacks me two days before a final\". After City beat Spurs, Mourinho sent a friend an image of the 'Finalists 2020/21' keyring that Spurs had seriously flogged.",
      "That is football heritage."

      "United are in the Europa League final after beating Athletic Bilbao 4-1 at Old Trafford. It means the 2024/25 season stays alive with less than two weeks until the showdown in Bilbao with Tottenham Hotspur.",
      "Off the pitch, United are being linked with several potential signings ahead of the summer transfer window.",
      "In the last 24 hours, reports have been pointing towards a major overhaul of United's attack. Viktor Gyokeres remains a target, with updates on Matheus Cunha, Liam Delap and Victor Osimhen all emerging.",
      "New players continue to be linked with a move to United with Paris Saint-Germain's Goncalo Ramos the latest number nine. Elsewhere, players continue to be linked with a move away from the club with the likes of Alejandro Garnacho and Rasmus Hojlund all having interest elsewhere.",
      "ports have emerged, once again, claiming that Alejandro Garnacho may be on the move before the start of next season.",
      "There has been reports suggesting that Bruno Fernandes could come under the watchful glare of the Saudi Pro League, as well as the future of Antony who has been in fine form for Real Betis.",
      "With this in mind, keep across all the latest United transfer news in our live blog below;",
      "Manchester United teenager Victor Musa has reportedly been compared to Barcelona star Lamine Yamal and Athletic Bilbao are said to be interested in signing him.",
      "AS claim that he is on Bilbao’s radar but that his dream is to play at senior level for United. Musa has previously represented Spain and England at youth level, and it is also claimed that the senior Spanish national team do not want to miss out on him.",
      "The report adds that Musa is viewed as United's answer to Yamal in Spain. Yamal, 17, has taken European football by storm since bursting onto the scene at Barcelona in 2023 and played a pivotal role in Spain's Euro 2024 triumph.",
      "Reds boss Ruben Amorim has already displayed his willingness to hand youth a chance since replacing Erik ten Hag as head coach in November. The former Sporting head coach has called up Chido Obi, Harry Amass and Tyler Fredricson as part of Europa League-focused rotation in the second half of the campaign.",
      "Paul Scholes believes Manchester United have a strong chance of winning the Europa League final against Tottenham, despite their record against the North London side in recent years.",
      "\"I am not saying they will win it, but history tells me they have a great chance of winning it. We know Tottenham have beaten them three times and Tottenham are a really good team, I like Tottenham. If they watch that first 70 minutes they will think 'we have got a right chance here'.",
      "\"But for some reason the history of this club, it's almost like Real Madrid at times. When they aren't playing that well but they can still go on and win European cups. I just feel the odds are slightly in Man United's favour, although Tottenham are a good side.\"",
      "Brazilian outlet Trivela reports that uncertainty continues to surround Casemiro’s future.",
      "According to the report, Man United have yet to inform the midfielder’s representatives whether he is part of their plans for the 2025/26 season, with Casemiro said to be 'waiting for a signal' from the club.",
      "Trivela state: \"In this scenario, United find themselves in a tough spot. The club needs to decide as soon as possible whether they want to count on the midfielder to activate the contract renewal clause. Otherwise, the likelihood is that Ruben Amorim will lose a starter for a price well below his value to the team.\"",
      "Man United continue to work behind the scenes to secure an agreement with Wolves for Matheus Cunha.",
      "The Athletic's David Ornstein claims that an offer has been made but an agreement is yet to be struck between parties.",
      "In addition, discussions are continuing to take place though not a great deal can happen before the season ends. With that said, it's thought the Reds will look to get personal terms in place in the meantime.",
      "Gary Neville has urged Manchester United to go out and sign Inter Milan's right wing-back Denzel Dumfries to fit into Ruben Amorim's 3-4-3 system.",
      "Dumfries, who was linked with a move to Old Trafford last summer - and before that even - is one of the very best wing-backs in European football and showed exactly what he is capable of in the Champions League semi-final. Of Inter's seven goals against Barcelona in the semi-final, he scored two and created three.",
      "Speaking on The Overlap, Neville said: \"Do you know what I kept thinking during the game? With the way Man United are playing with a back five and wing-backs under Ruben Amorim, I was thinking about that right wing-back.",
      "\"I was thinking about Dumfries for United. I would like to see him in the Premier League, wouldn't you? How good was he? He was unbelievable. He's so good, so good.\"",
      "There’s been a positive development in United’s pursuit of a new striker after Liam Delap reportedly emerged as their top target.",
      "According to The Athletic, the necessary funds to land him are already in place, though the deal is expected to take some time to finalise.",
      "This delay is attributed to strong competition for Delap’s signature, as the player has yet to decide on his preferred destination.",
      "Manchester United will take all of their first-team squad members on their post-season tour of Malaysia and Hong Kong.",
      "United are playing two matches on May 28 and 30 after their final Premier League game of the season against Aston Villa in a trip that they are expected to pocket around £8million from.",
      "\"Yes, I was consulted,\" Amorim said. \"And again, I already spoke about that. We cannot say nothing after this season.",
      "\"So we need to help the club, because the club wins some money. We are going to connect with our fans around the world and that is important, especially when we lose and we disappoint our supporters during this tough season. So I think it's the least we can do.",
      "\"And we are going to take all the team, young kids also, we'll have the staff there. We have a lot of changes in the staff, so we are trying to build something as a family. I think it's also a good thing.\"",
      "Read more here.",
      "Arsenal sporting director Andrea Berta has arranged a meeting with Matheus Cunha's representatives over a potential move to the club, according to Ben Jacobs.",
      "United remain the favourites for the forward after reports that the Brazilian was sold on Ruben Amorim's project. No deal has been agreed yet as his release clause doesn't become active until the end of the season.",
      "Man United have been labelled as a serious contender in the race to sign Jonathan Tah from Bayer Leverkusen.",
      "The defender is leaving the German club at the end of his contract and accordin got CF Bayern Insider, United are one team to watch in the race. Christian Falk has also added that Bayern Munich and Barcelona are in the race.",
      "“They (Bayern)’re discussing a move for Jonathan Tah and have made contact through the Leverkusen defender’s agent, Pini Zahavi. Zahavi now has to clarify whether or not there is an opportunity for Barcelona to register him. If not, he will be on the market again.",
      "“Many clubs are following Jonathan Tah, including Premier League sides. Still, we shouldn’t overlook the fact that Bayern Munich had an agreement in the pipeline last summer, and now he’s set to become a free agent. It would be easier to bring him in now, and Bayern have made it clear that they need a new centre-back with Eric Dier set to join Monaco this summer. So Bayern Munich will look to try and get him.",
      "“Manchester United, who have been linked with Tah, is always going to be a serious competitor. I think Jonathan Tah would like to have an experience in the Premier League. There aren’t so many clubs searching in this position, so, of course, United is an opportunity.”",
      "Manchester United have entered the race to sign Paris Saint-Germain striker Goncalo Ramos, according to reports.",
      "Ramos isn't a player the potential Champions League winners are looking to sell, but Caught Offside have claimed growing interest means an exit isn't ruled out.",
      "United and Arsenal are said to be among the clubs keen.",
      "Former Man United midfielder Paul Scholes has insisted that he fears Alejandro Garnacho could score a number of goals for somebody else, if he leaves in the summer.",
      "\"I fear we will see him for £50-60m for PSR reasons. It’s been rumoured, hasn’t it? I fear he will end up scoring 25 to 30 goals for somebody else, that’s how good I think this lad can be.",
      "\"Shoehorning him into this system might be tricky, I’m struggling to find a position for him in Ruben Amorim’s system. I don’t want them to sell him, I hate the thought of that, but I think they could do. I wouldn’t like it. He frustrates me but he’s often the biggest threat for Manchester United.\"",
      "Inter Milan defender Denzel Dumfries has caught the eye of the football world in the last two weeks with his performances in the Champions League.",
      "The Netherlands internatonal was pivotal in Inter's win over Barcelona and Gary Neville has claimed he would be superb addition to Man United as a right wing-back in Ruben Amorim's system.",

      "It didn't take Ange Postecoglou long to light the blue touch paper ahead of a Europa League final in Bilbao later this month that has more than just a trophy riding on it.",
      "For Manchester United and Tottenham, this is about the silverware and the shekels. For the winner, there will be the riches and the lustre of a Champions League campaign next season. For the loser, there will be the ignominy of one of the worst seasons in their club's history, and if that is Postecoglou, probably a P45 to boot.",
      "Ruben Amorim won't face that fate if the result doesn't go United's way on May 21 but you can be certain the Portuguese head coach is desperate for a trophy to add credence to his Old Trafford face-lift and significantly boost his budget in what is a key first summer window.",
      "For Postecoglou, it feels like win or bust, and reading his comments after Tottenham silenced the doubters by winning with relative ease in Norway on Thursday, it feels like he is already trying to start the mind games ahead of an all-Premier League showdown.",
      "The Aussie was asked about Amorim's comments that winning the Europa League wouldn't save United's season, but rather than acknowledge Spurs have underperformed in the Premier League, he came out swinging, deliberately misinterpreting those comments as he sought to paint the narrative that this final simply means more to Tottenham.",
      "\"Why do I care what Manchester United think? Ask the Manchester United manager why he says that. I've said all along this is important,\" said Postecoglou.",
      "\"What's happening right now is people are fearing that. That it actually might happen. And let's see if we can tear it down and diminish it somehow by saying it's been a poor season and we don't deserve this or that and comparing us to Manchester United.",
      "\"Maybe if we'd had Manchester United's success I'd have a different view.",
      "\"But I came into this role...I could have been sitting here in fifth position and I guarantee the commentary would have been: 'That's great Ange but this club needs to win something.'",
      "\"Of course it's massive. You have to frame it against what this club has been through over the last 15-20 years, what the supporters have been through. Manchester United have got their own journey. Maybe if they go 15 years without winning something they'll change their own perspective as well.\"",
      "There are several aspects of this answer that make little sense, so it's worth dealing with them in order. For starters, Amorim's comments that winning the Europa League wouldn't save the club's season wasn't a disparaging aside about Europe's secondary competition, it was an admittance that a disastrous Premier League campaign cannot be ignored.",
      "Postecoglou appears determined to do just that, and when his job is on the line, perhaps you can see why. However, there is an argument that the differing views here simply speak to a difference in the standards they expect. Amorim knows that 15th in the Premier League over a 38-game season isn't good enough, regardless of the success that comes in cup competitions.",
      "Postecoglou has been telling critics he always wins a trophy in his second season for most of the year. Although Spurs sit 16th in the Premier League, he appears to believe that would be acceptable as long as he is hoisting the 65cm high trophy in the Basque Country in a couple of weeks. Tottenham fans will probably disagree.",
      "Within his answer, Postecoglou cites the long trophy drought in North London, and he is right that winning the Europa League will be a memorable night for the club and the supporters, but when the ticker tape is cleared away and the parade is finished with, the bare facts will still make for unpalatable reading. It is over a league season where managers are judged, and when a domestic campaign has been as bad as United's and Tottenham's, no amount of silverware can transform it.",
      "It's also not the case that Amorim is downplaying winning the Europa League because United have won 20 league titles and three European Cups. It doesn't reduce the meaning of this trophy. He is saying what he is because he accepts no excuses can be made for a dismal league campaign.",
      "When it comes to kick-off in Bilbao, Tottenham will probably be the neutrals' choice. The idea that people are fearing Spurs winning a trophy suggests their manager is overestimating the strength of feeling for a club that doesn't really stir any strong emotions outside of the London derby bubble.",
      "Nobody is saying United or Tottenham don't deserve to win the Europa League. Both have navigated difficult fixtures and tough moments to reach the final. They would be worthy winners. What Amorim is saying is that even that success won't gloss over what has happened domestically. Postecoglou should probably try the same honest approach."

      "\"I think he is going to be a top, top, top player and is going to have a great career here in Manchester,\" Ruben Amorim said of Leny Yoro earlier this year.",
      "The Manchester United head coach made that prediction two days after Yoro had produced arguably his most accomplished performance for the club up to that point in a 3-2 win over Ipswich Town at Old Trafford.",
      "Deployed on the left of the back-three, Yoro made it his personal mission to get himself on the ball as often as he could and help United progress the ball from deep, despite not playing on his natural side.",
      "Following United's switch to a three-at-the-back formation after Amorim's appointment back in November, it was quickly anticipated Yoro would become the Portuguese chief's first-choice option to start at right-sided centre-back and help United progress the ball on that side of the pitch.",
      "Despite having stints in the team in that position, the best of the Frenchman's displays have come as the left-sided centre-back, despite him being right-footed, further highlighted by his top drawer performance against Athletic Bilbao at Old Trafford on Thursday night.",
      "Just as he had against Athletic at the San Mames Stadium seven days earlier, Yoro was deployed on the left of the back-three, joining forces in defence with Harry Maguire and Victor Lindelof. He was the coolest operator of the trio and his performance was arguably his best yet in a United shirt, helping them reach the Europa League final with a 7-1 aggregate triumph.",
      "As well as winning ten of his 14 duels, producing five clearances, blocking four shots, winning two tackles and making one interception in a superb defensive display, the 19-year-old also produced an excellent performance with the ball, frequently showing a hunger to get United up the pitch and into advanced areas.",
      "He completed 88 per cent of his attempted passes, produced two key passes and got the assist for Mason Mount's superb equaliser. For the goal, he received a square pass from Luke Shaw high up the pitch, dropped his shoulder, advanced into the penalty area and nudged the ball into Mount's feet to turn and shoot.",
      "Both the turn and the finish from Mount were superb, but they would not have been possible without Yoro's willingness to advance into such an attacking position.",
      "In the modern game, centre-backs are constantly encouraged to be strong in possession and take risks to help their team get up the pitch. United strengthened that particular skill in the summer of 2022 by recruiting ball-playing centre-back Lisandro Martinez, who embraced Yoro after the full-time whistle on Thursday evening.",
      "Like Yoro, he has not been without his injury problems since joining United, meaning they have been starved of that ball-playing expertise too often this season. However, Yoro's ever-improving performances are now giving United an extra dimension they can lean on.",
      "And the former Lille man, who joined United last summer for an initial fee of £52.2million, admitted after last month's goalless draw with Manchester City at Old Trafford that Amorim had been encouraging him to carry the ball into advanced positions.",
      "Yoro said: \"We need to control the game. If I can bring the ball forward for the strikers, for the midfielders, it is good for us, so I try to do it.",
      "\"Yes, the coach has asked me to do it, I am ready to do it and I can do it.\"",
      "Yoro completed 89 per cent of his passes against City that afternoon, once again highlighting his composure and confidence with the ball at his feet. Over his last ten starts, his passing accuracy of 88 per cent against Athletic on Thursday night was the lowest accuracy percentage he has recorded in that period, with him completing 93 per cent of his attempted passes five times in his last ten starts.",
      "With the numbers backing up his on-the-eye displays, Yoro's performances are undoubtably getting better with every game he plays. After the start of his United career was delayed until December because of a pre-season injury, he is now rapidly making up for lost time.",
      "His ball-carrying expertise is a massive feather in his cap, making it easy to understand why United had to see off interest from Real Madrid last summer to win the race for his signature.",
      "Backed to become a \"top, top, top player\" by Amorim just over two months ago, the Frenchman's displays mean he that he is well on his way to proving the United boss right."

      "A possible return to the Premier League looks unlikely for Mason Greenwood according to reports.",
      "Greenwood has had a fantastic season in France with Marseille, the club Manchester United sold their academy graduate to for £26.6m last summer. He is the second highest goalscorer in Ligue 1 with a tally of 18, just three behind PSG superstar Ousmane Dembele.",
      "The 23-year-old had scored 35 goals and secured 12 assists in his 129 appearances with United, so he hasn't lost his goal-scoring prowess since leaving the Reds. With these stats, Greenwood could be a hot commodity in the transfer market, but a Premier League return looks unlikely, if the latest reports are to be believed.",
      "TEAMtalk has reported that several Premier League clubs have privately shown interest in Greenwood but are unlikely to make a move for him this summer.",
      "United are said to receive a 50 per cent cut of any profits made from a Greenwood sale if Marseille were to let him go. While a major windfall from a Premier League move seems unlikely, clubs in Saudi Arabia are said to have an interest in the forward.",
      "The Saudi Pro League's interest in Greenwood is purely speculation at the moment, but patterns from the Middle-East in relation to transfers often link to big money. Aston Villa sold 21-year-old John Duran for £64m, so if Marseille were able to sell Greenwood for anywhere near that price could see United earn north of £18m from their sell-on cut.",
      "The lack of interest in a Premier League side buying Greenwood closes one door for United's likelihood of securing the sell-on fee which could prove vital to boosting Ruben Amorim's budget in the summer transfer market.",
      "United's hopes are most likely to revolve around Greenwood remaining abroad, with another club either from Europe or the Middle East making a move. His contract with Marseille runs until 2029."

      "Tottenham Hotspur midfielder James Maddison has admitted he is 'gutted' that he will be missing the Europa League final against Manchester United in less than two weeks.",
      "United and Spurs both booked their places in the European finale on Thursday night with comfortable victories over Athletic Bilbao and Bodo/Glimt, respectively. The Reds, inspired by Mason Mount, eased to a 4-1 win at Old Trafford to advance 7-1 on aggregate.",
      "Meanwhile, a professional Tottenham beat Bodo/Glimt 2-0 in Norway to advance 5-1 on aggregate. The results means that United and Spurs will be battling it out to become the sixth English club in the Champions League next season despite their horrid Premier League campaigns.",
      "Ahead of the final on May 21, Tottenham are already struggling with an injury crisis as key midfielder Maddison was ruled out for the season with a knee injury earlier this week. This of course means that the England international will not be in the squad that faces Ruben Amorim's side in Bilbao.",
      "On Friday, with the final now confirmed, Maddison released a statement on Instagram expressing his regret that he won't be playing in the game. \"Gutted. Just absolutely gutted,\" he wrote.",
      "\"We’ve had our sights on that European final in Bilbao from day one of this campaign. So to accept not being able to take part out on that pitch with the boys is really tough to take.",
      "\"Injuries are just part of this game that can be so cruel at times. But I truly believe that it can be a special night for my football club.",
      "\"Bring on the 21st. All together. #COYS\"",
      "It has been a challenging season for Maddison, like it has been for many of the players that will take the field in Bilbao, but he still remains a big loss for Ange Postecoglou's side. He has scored 12 goals this season, including a winner over United in the Premier League, and bagged himself 11 assists across all competitions."

      "As the saying goes, one swallow doesn't make a summer. And one match-winning cameo doesn't make a No.7.",
      "The infamous No.7 curse at Old Trafford needs little explanation. A nostalgic flick back through history tells us that some of Manchester United's greatest ever players wore that particular shirt number with pride - yet more recent 'owners' of (arguably) the most famous shirt in world football haven't hit such heights.",
      "George Best, Eric Cantona, David Beckham, Cristiano Ronaldo (twice). Every United supporter will have their own favourite No.7 from years gone by and each of those stars etched their names into the club's history books, while Mason Mount might now be able to emerge from the shadows and underline his own credentials.",
      "Injuries, form and so forth have effected the former Chelsea man heavily since a big-money move to Old Trafford ahead of the 2023/2024 season. The now-sacked Erik ten Hag thought so highly of Mount that he added the No.7 shirt front and centre into his and the club's sales package to lure the midfielder in from Stamford Bridge.",
      "It worked. Mount left Chelsea for a staggering £65million, but has yet to repay that transfer fee.",
      "However, the fit-again 26-year-old might well have kick-started his Old Trafford career. He was sensational after a second-half introduction against Athletic Club in their Europa League semi-final showdown on Thursday night and United might well find it difficult not to give him more air-time in the showpiece.",
      "Mount doubled and then tripled his season's goal tally to send Bilbao packing. His second on the night had shades of the Beckham about it and while the comparisons end there - for now - Mount finally has his own springboard to lift the No.7 curse once and for all.",
      "Ronaldo - or CR7 to offer up his moniker - briefly did so in his second coming. However, since the Portugal captain left United for the first time in 2009 when Real Madrid came calling, there have been few glittering moments from United No.7s as we take a look at those who have tried - and failed - to join the more successful club;",
      "Not quite the player he was at Liverpool or Real Madrid before. Granted, he still won the Premier League title in 2011, but 17 goals in 52 outings was by no means his best return.",
      "A successful and popular player in his own right, Valencia spent 10 years at Old Trafford, book-ending his time as No.7 by wearing the No.25 shirt. It was in the latter he enjoyed better days for United, accumulating 400 matches and six major honours, including two Premier League titles and the Europa League in 2017.",
      "The less said about Di Maria at United, the better. A worthy No.7 elsewhere, but not in Manchester.",
      "Big things were expected when United splashed out for Depay, when Louis van Gaal was manager. He was highly-rated in the Netherlands and Europe at the time, but he was ultimately unable to cut the mustard, before going on to forge a successful career with Lyon, later representing Barcelona and Atletico Madrid.",
      "A similar story to Di Maria, unfortunately. Magic elsewhere, but not at United.",
      "In the twilight of his career, Cavani showed glimpses at Old Trafford and beyond, without doing quite enough to place his name alongside No.7 royalty. He graciously gave up the shirt to Ronaldo, when he arrived for his second spell at the club, before Cavani left in 2022 with 19 goals and 59 games to his name in United colours."

      "Now United head into the final to face a familiar opponent who they will have bad memories of coming up against. This season, the Reds have lost three times to Tottenham Hotspur and there could be little complaints about any of the scorelines.",
      "Amorim joked that United must now be due a victory considering the results so far this season but if they are to do that, they must make full use of the advantage of having already played in the San Mames Stadium. Of course, the host arena for the final is also the home of Athletic Bilbao and the Reds showed they know exactly how to get a result at the Basque stadium.",
      "In the first leg of their Europa League semi-final last week, United showed they were not overwhelmed by the intimidating atmosphere inside the San Mames Stadium. From 30 minutes onwards, United dominated and while they were helped by their man advantage, they never looked in danger of letting their comfortable lead slip.",
      "This time, United shall benefit from a less hostile crowd with at least 14,500 supporters in the stadium cheering on Amorim's men. But it cannot be underestimated how important it is for professional footballers to be familiar with their surroundings before a game of this magnitude.",

      "Ruben Amorim expressed his delight for Manchester United midfielder Mason Mount after his decisive performance in their Europa League semi-final victory against Athletic Bilbao.",
      "Mount came on in the 62nd minute with United 1-0 down in the second leg and scored his first Old Trafford goal ten minutes later to equalise on the night and put United 4-1 ahead on aggregate. The 26-year-old rounded off the scoring in the 7-1 aggregate triumph with a perfectly-clipped lob from 40 yards with goalkeeper Julen Agirrezabala outside the area.",
      "Amorim has repeatedly said he \"loves\" Mount, who made his first start in nearly five months in the 4-3 defeat at Brentford on Sunday. The attacking midfielder has now scored three goals in two games and is competing for a place in United's Europa League final XI as one of the two playmakers in the Portuguese's 3-4-2-1 formation.",
      "\"Not just me,\" Amorim said when asked about his happy reaction to Mount's performance. \"If you look at the bench, that is the best feeling for a coach. When you look at the other guys on the bench are so happy for Mason Mount because everybody in that dressing room sees Mason Mount do everything he can to be available.",
      "\"He’s a really good player and both goals are really good goals, so I think not just Mason Mount, not just me, the teammates were so happy for him.",
      "\"Was a good result. I think if you look at both games was so much tougher than if you just look to the result. We have so many weaknesses, you can understand that but we are fighting and we deserve if you look at two games, to be in the final.",
      "\"The money is not the most important, even the title to win as a coach, is that feeling that we can do good things, the feeling to give something to our fans, particularly in this season. It’s not just playing Champions League next season it’s that feeling that we can change things\"",
      "United's opponents in the Europa League final, Tottenham, are unbeaten against United under coach Ange Postecoglou. Since Postecoglou was appointed in the summer of 2023, Spurs have beaten United four times and drawn once.",
      "The final in Bilbao is widely expected to be Postecoglou's last match in charge of Tottenham, who are below 15th-placed United in the Premier League. Amorim admitted he and Postecoglou are \"struggling\" and reiterated he has no idea which United will turn up in the final on May 21.",
      "\"Every game has its history,\" Amorim added. \"We lost the three last games (against Tottenham), we can win this one.",
      "\"So if you look at the loss, we are closer to win than to lose. Both teams are going play all or nothing, the position of the coach is quite similar.",
      "\"I know Ange has one more year, it is different, the context, but we are struggling both of us! I don’t know what is going to happen, it’s a good thing and a bad thing with this team, I never know!",
      "\"So I will try to prepare the game. But I think we are improving if we had more solutions. We can take (Alejandro) Garnacho with the speed, transition, for Amad and to have that possibility can win games. Mason Mount, Kobbie Mainoo, all these players, we can choose from these players and to prepare the final in a better way.",
      "\"It’s a final, completely different from Premier League games.\""

      "Man Utd’s rebuild under Ruben Amorim is gathering pace, but one former England international believes their problems go far beyond any one signing, no matter how talented.",
      "Chris Waddle has warned Man Utd must brace themselves for a long-term rebuild under Amorim and avoid falling back into short-term fixes as he attempts to repair an age",
      "“Manchester United have an ageing squad,” he said.",
      "“Ruben Amorim, who has a massive job on his hands, has brought a lot of young players through. They have to keep their hands off the panic button this summer. They need to give him time, and there are players there that he needs to move on.”",
      "Waddle also stressed that United’s biggest challenge this summer might not be who they bring in, but who they can afford to get off the books.",
      "“They need a big investment,” he continued.",
      "“Four or five players need to come in, but the even bigger challenge will be getting rid of some. They’re on massive wages. The clubs that will want them won’t have the financial muscle United do, and it’ll be tough to sell them on to Italy or Spain.”",
      "Amorim is expected to be backed in the transfer market this summer as Ineos and Sir Jim Ratcliffe look to reshape the first team and staff structure behind the scenes. But patience, Waddle thinks, will be just as important as new signings.",
      "“They lost 4-3 to Brentford, but until Amorim gets his own team together, it’s too early to judge. I think the top six is still a massive challenge for United next season. They need two or three years with Amorim in charge. They have to stop changing managers.”",
      "Still, the club is moving early to secure what could be their first major incoming of the Amorim era – a dynamic, versatile forward who has been one of the standout attacking players outside the traditional top six this season.",
      "Sources close to the deal, such as transfer guru Fabrizio Romano, indicate United are in advanced talks with Wolves over a move for Matheus Cunha, with negotiations centring around a fee in excess of £50 million.",
      "Waddle, while full of praise for the Brazilian’s ability, was quick to temper the hype.",
      "“Cunha is a fantastic footballer. He can be temperamental, but perhaps United would be the making of him,” he said. “You can’t be mardy at a club like that — the fans will let you know.”",
      "Cunha, 25, has scored 15 Premier League goals this season for Wolves and is widely viewed as ready for a step up. Waddle believes the move could be transformative if the player embraces the pressure.",
      "“He probably thinks he’s at the stage when he should be at a club like United. Wolves are a big club, but Cunha will be looking for another level up.",
      "“He’s got a huge opportunity here. If he’s one of the players to turn United around and [get them] challenging again, he could be like Eric Cantona, the man who changed United.”",
      "It’s a lofty comparison, but one that hints at the scale of hope and expectation surrounding Amorim’s first major recruit.",
      "Man Utd have been linked with a move for Brentford winger Bryan Mbeumo along with Wolves forward Matheus Cunha ahead of the summer transfer window.",

      "United are thought to be near the front of the queue to pounce on the 26-year-old if a new contract isn’t forthcoming.",
      "The report adds:",
      "‘From Paris, for now, they remain silent about a possible exit, but the growing interest of the ‘red devils’ and other European clubs could accelerate events. If PSG fails to renew its star goalkeeper, the next summer market could be decisive for its future.

      "The winger, who was signed by Amorim for just £5m in the summer of 2023 after an initial loan spell, has managed eight goals and 15 assists in the Portuguese top flight this season, and is one of Amorim’s ‘goals to maintain his offensive block for next season’.",

      "The report adds:",
      "‘In short, Manchester United could become the perfect partner for Barça this summer.

Liverpool spent almost nothing to win the title, Arsenal spent more to fail once again (though Mikel Arteta has his own theories about that), Brighton spent a metric f***-tonne of money to stand still, and Ipswich made an inspired striker signing but went down anyway.",

Two years ago Arsenal signed Declan Rice and nearly won the title, while Chelsea and Liverpool engaged in a Moises Caicedo battle which left the Blues as only short-term winners. Compared to the underwhelming machinations of last summer, 2023 provided halcyon days.",

      "Manchester United vs Tottenham Hotspur is a Europa League final to look forward to, and despite their domestic struggles, they’ve comfortably been the two best teams in the competition this season.",
      "Spurs have looked oddly at ease in Europe, completely contradicting their Premier League form, while Ruben Amorim’s side remain the only unbeaten team in European competition this season.",
      "They brushed aside Athletic Bilbao 7-1 on aggregate, with a pair of three-goal wins. And while Thursday’s second leg flirted with drama, the failure of Bilbao to find a second goal meant Old Trafford never truly descended into panic.",
      "In a competition United have to win, Amorim took no risks, naming the same XI that had coasted to victory in Spain.",
      "It was never going to be as easy this time – it simply couldn’t go any worse for Ernesto Valverde and his players than it had in the first leg. Even without the Williams brothers, with both Nico and Inaki ruled out through injury. Yes, that Inaki Williams – the one who once played 251 straight La Liga games. Turns out he’s not indestructible.",
      "Bilbao were trying to overturn a 3-0 deficit against a side worth considerably more than them. To put it into context, they’ve only twice spent more on a player than United did just to sack Erik ten Hag and hire Amorim. There’s your pointless stat of the night.",
      "And yet, for all that disparity, any away side has a bit of hope at Old Trafford these days. Bilbao gave it a go. The issue? Finishing. Or lack of it.",
      "Alex Berenguer tried to find the postage stamp and overhit it. Mikel Jauregizar, just 21, did manage their only shot on target – a lovely long-range strike that Andre Onana parried into the net.",
      "It was a brutal 60 seconds for United: Bilbao scored to inject a bit of tension, and at the same time, £80million flop Antony was bending in a free-kick for Real Betis. Manchester United players getting good again the second they leave Old Trafford’s orbit will never not be funny.",
      "Another common occurrence is Alejandro Garnacho missing simple one-on-ones. His dink wide only added to the unease, and the sense grew that Bilbao might just nick a second and make this properly nervy.",
      "But it didn’t happen.",
      "Mason Mount’s sublime equaliser killed the tie and Bilbao completely gave up. Casemiro added another – a header, as in the first leg – just to rub it in and make sure United’s unbeaten record in Europe lives on.",
      "Rasmus Hojlund thought he’d rounded it off with a tap-in, but the cherry was reserved for Mount’s second – and third in two games – a left-footed effort from somewhere near Salford. Listen, fair play.",
      "Amorim’s subs did the damage. Mount bagged a brace. Amad Diallo set up Hojlund. Kobbie Mainoo squeezed in two take-ons in just 11 minutes. Lovely job.",
      "And so, we get the final we didn’t know we needed: two broken Premier League giants, 15th vs 16th, 35 combined defeats, not a single one of them on 40 points. And yet, they’ll meet in Bilbao with a place in next season’s Champions League and millions on the line.",
      "It’s ridiculous. But it’s not undeserved. In this competition, they’ve looked the part. That’s all that counts.",
      "The loser, though, is going to feel it like a tonne of bricks. For United, it’s about funding a rebuild that would be near-impossible without Champions League football and that windfall.",
      "For Spurs, it could decide Postecoglou’s job – even if they win it, he’s not safe; if they don’t, he’s done. They might be better equipped to absorb the blow, but don’t mistake that for a lack of hunger. This is a club still chasing its first trophy since 2008, in case you weren’t aware.",
      "United have fared far better on the silverware front in that time, even when you take out the five years under Sir Alex Ferguson. Win in Bilbao, and they’ll have won a trophy in each of the last three seasons. Somehow. Despite being a complete and utter shambles on and off the pitch.",
      "Honestly, we didn’t expect it to pan out this way, but we are absolutely here for it and genuinely excited for a football match where two teams try their absolute hardest to lose.",

      "Including four Manchester United players, transfer expert David Ornstein has named 22 players ‘available’ in the summer transfer window.",
      "It promises to be a busy summer, with Arsenal, United, Chelsea, and Liverpool all targeting a striker.",
      "Several strikers are being linked with moves to the Premier League, including RB Leipzig’s Benjamin Sesko and Lille’s Jonathan David, while Wolves’ Matheus Cunha and Ipswich Town’s Liam Delap are expected to join another English club.",
      "Ruben Amorim’s side has a lot of work to do this summer and wants to sign both Delap and Cunha.",
      "However, they will need to sell players in order to buy, and Ornstein has stated that they have three players they could sell. Christian Eriksen will also be available on a free transfer following the expiry of his contract.",
      "In addition to Eriksen, Ornstein mentions that on-loan stars Marcus Rashford and Jadon Sancho are ‘available’.",
      "There is also a possibility that winger Alejandro Garnacho could leave. Ornstein noted, ‘Maybe Garnacho’ as one of the 22 players ‘available’ this summer, ‘off the top of his head’ when answering a question on The Athletic.",
      "Garnacho was linked with Chelsea and Napoli in January but stayed at Old Trafford, despite the latter selling Khvicha Kvaratskhelia to PSG.",
      "The names of Rashford – on loan at Aston Villa – and Sancho – at Chelsea – appearing should surprise no one.",
      "The United players named by Ornstein are not the biggest names on his list of 22 players expected to be available at the end of the 2024/25 season.",
      "Let’s run through them, shall we?",
      "Viktor Gyokeres (Sporting), Benjamin Sesko (Leipzig) and Jonathan David (Lille)\nThree big-name strikers expected to be on the move this summer. David is entering free agency, Sesko has a gentleman’s agreement to leave Leipzig and Gyokeres will spread his wings elsewhere after two incredibly productive years in Lisbon.",
      "David’s future is massively unclear, but I do know he won’t be playing for Lille next season.",
      "One of Sesko or Gyokeres will likely end up at Arsenal, we suspect. Whoever doesn’t might end up at Chelsea.",
      "",
      "Liam Delap (Ipswich) and Matheus Cunha (Wolves)\nCunha’s future appears to lie at Old Trafford, but there are too many clubs interested in Delap to predict where he’ll end up.",
      "",
      "Bryan Mbeumo (Brentford)\nEighteen Premier League goals this season is an outrageous return for a Brentford player and they have bloody two of them! Yoane Wissa is not being linked with an exit, but Mbeumo is headed for the door. Club captain Christian Norgaard said this week: “I think Bryan is likely to go. I don’t know about Wissa yet. Everyone hopes that he might stay. Either way, I’m happy for the season and am happy for both of them. They deserve it so much.”",
      "Arsenal and Newcastle and Man United are being strongly linked with the Cameroonian.",
      "",
      "Darwin Nunez (Liverpool)\nWho will take a chance on Darwin, then? A Liverpool exit seems inevitable.",
      "",
      "Kevin De Bruyne (Man City)\nAsked about De Bruyne to Liverpool, Ornstein replied to another reader: ‘As far as we understand, Hugo, Liverpool are not signing De Bruyne. He is good friends with members of their squad, notably Virgil van Dijk, and I’m sure those guys would love to play alongside him, but any notion of the Premier League champions moving for him are thought to be wide of the mark.’",
      "City legend KDB is out of contract this summer.",
      "",
      "Antoine Semenyo, Dean Huijsen and Milos Kerkez (Bournemouth)\nBournemouth should rake in the big bucks this summer, with three of their star players wanted by Premier League rivals. Huijsen’s exit is all but confirmed, but to who, Chris Kamara? Kerkez is destined for Liverpool, it seems. Ornstein adds that Semenyo will ‘potentially’ leave. Ooh, the uncertainty.",
      "",
      "Cristian Romero (Spurs)\n‘Probably’ available, Ornstein says. He also only gave surnames. I’m pretty confident he was referring to the Spurs Romero. Atletico Madrid are keen.",
      "",
      "Oleksandr Zinchenko (Arsenal)\nOut of favour at Arsenal, who are addicted to signing left-backs under Mikel Arteta, Zinchenko will leave this summer and knowing the Gunners, they’ll get £5m for him and he will go on to be world-class elsewhere.",
      "",
      "Marc Guehi (Crystal Palace)\nNewcastle tried and failed last summer. They should come back for him in June.",
      "",
      "Jamie Gittens (Borussia Dortmund), Jorrel Hato (Ajax), Mike Maignan (Milan) and Jonathan Tah (Bayer Leverkusen)\nThe rest, I guess. The only surprise out of these four is AC Milan and France goalkeeper Maignan. He is club captain and his country’s long-term No. 1, but he is out of contract next year so the Italian giants could seek a fee this summer.",
      "Tah, meanwhile, is out of contract in 2025 and wanted by a host of clubs. The latest we have on Gittens is that Arsenal want him, and Hato is one of the most promising defenders in the world and wanted by every top club."

      "Roy Keane has come up with a new reason why Manchester United are an “absolute disgrace” and took an unnecessary swipe at Harry Maguire, who “CROSSED THE BALL!”",
      "Manchester United are enduring a dismal domestic season and sit 15th in the Premier League having won just ten of their 35 games this term, with legendary captain Keane one of their harshest critics.",
      "The European League could be their saving grace though as victory over Athletic Club in the semi-final followed by a win over either Tottenham or Bodo/Glimt would mean a trophy for Ruben Amorim in his his first season in charge and crucial entry into the Champions League next term.",
      "Playing in Europe’s showcase competition will make United more alluring to potential new recruits ahead of what looks to be a significant summer rebuild, and grant the club with more money to make those changes.",
      "But Keane isn’t impressed with United simply being happy about being in the competition next term, having played for the club when they were competing to win it.",
      "Keane said on the Stick to Football podcast: “Everyone’s saying if United are in it, how big United are, that United are going to be in the Champions League. You’re talking like they’re a small club, they’ve got no chance of winning it.",
      "“The way it’s panned out now, it’ll be huge for the club, and the format might be that they’ll win one or two games because of the seeding, but in terms of winning it, United are going ‘we have to be in it’, they’re not talking about winning it! ‘",
      "“‘We just have to be in it for financial reasons, what a place to be.”",
      "United have a very good chance of reaching the Europa League final after claiming a 3-0 away win in the first leg, but Keane claims they’re an “absolute disgrace” for giving up on the Premier League to focus on Europe.",
      "“(I’m just fed up at) how bad they are,” Keane added. “They’re getting on my nerves, they keep talking about a big game next week, they’re not even trying.",
      "“A couple of weeks ago at Newcastle they said ‘we couldn’t focus because we’ve got Lyon coming up’ so they keep writing these matches off.",
      "“I understand it’s a big game, so you just dismiss these league matches? They’re a disgrace, an absolute disgrace.”",
      "The panel went on to discuss Inter Milan defender’s Denzel Dumfries’ outstanding displays against Barcelona in their two-legged semi-final tie, with Gary Neville insisting he would like to see United sign the Dutchman.",
      "Jill Scott then couldn’t resist riling Keane further by joking that Amorim should play Maguire at right wing-back after the defender assisted Casemiro’s opener in Spain last week.",
      "“Oh relax Jill, will you,” Keane fired back. “I know you’re joking. Harry Maguire last week. Harry Maguire crossed the ball and everyone’s going ‘what amazing feet’.",
      "“HE CROSSED THE BALL! Skill? He did a little shimmy, crossed it! It’s not bad for £80m is it, someone who can cross the ball! Oh my god! You’re all living in cuckoo land.”",
      "Roy Keane and Gary Neville agree with Arsene Wenger’s call for a UEFA rules change which would cost both Manchester United and Tottenham.",
      "Man Utd defender Harry Maguire is one of four Red Devils stars ‘immune’ to their ‘fire sale’ in the summer transfer window, according to reports.",
      "Arsenal risk a ‘disaster’ if they sack Mikel Arteta, while two ‘worries’ for Manchester United remain after their ‘brilliance’ vs Athletic Bilbao.",
      "Manchester United legend Gary Pallister has suggested that Ruben Amorim should consider dropping a Europa League hero as he may not be the out-and-out best player in any position he’s ...",
      "Liverpool have one of their ‘biggest ever summer transfer budgets’, and an XI of signings made by champions dominated by Manchester United to break into.",
      "Roy Keane piled in on Jamie Vardy earlier this week, criticising the Leicester forward’s relegation apology days before announcing his departure."

      "Marcus Rashford may well have played his last games for both Manchester United and Aston Villa, so where will he play his football next season?",
      "We know he wants Champions League football, we know – according to the Guardian at least – that he does not want to play for a London club, and we know that Villa have agreed a £40m fee for Rashford but United would want more money from any other club.",
      "So where will he end up? These are the favourites for his home in 2025/26 according to the latest odds and reports:",
      "",
      "1) Barcelona\nThe ‘dream’, apparently. There was lengthy talk of a loan to the Spanish giants in January but they pulled other levers instead and Rashford is said to be keen to join ‘no matter what‘. The problem? Barcelona are said to be reluctant to pay £40m for Rashford, which is surely the very least that Manchester United will accept after he proved he is still a very effective and motivated footballer at Villa.",
      "",
      "2) Manchester United\nIs there a chance that he stays and is rehabilitated? It seems very bloody unlikely but it has happened before. Surely this is only a scenario if no Champions League club will pay £40m, in which case another loan seems rather more likely than being reintegrated by Ruben Amorim.",
      "",
      "3) Aston Villa\nHe’s there, he’s happy, he clearly has a good relationship with the manager and the club’s fans and he has played some excellent football for Villa as they reached the Champions League quarter-finals. But – and this is quite a big but – as it stands, they are bound for the Conference League and Rashford, now more than ever, will feel like he is a Champions League player, which might lead him to…",
      "",
      "4) Arsenal\nWe have read that Rashford is not interested in a move to a London club so this feels like a non-starter, but would he really turn down a move to the perennial runners-up – where he would be an upgrade on 24/25 Gabriel Martinelli – if they were his only Champions League option?",
      "",
      "5) PSG\nThe Champions League finalists – and conquerors of Liverpool, Aston Villa and Arsenal – are said to be in ‘pole position’ for Rashford and that certainly makes a great deal of sense. They are long-time admirers, the £40m would be no issue and they are Champions League stalwarts. But would they really bring in Rashford so soon after forking out for the rather impressive Khvicha Kvaratskhelia?",
      "For our money, only Real Madrid have a greater transfer lure.",
      "",
      "6) AC Milan\nA throwback to the January move that never was, which was scuppered by Milan’s more pressing need for Kyle Walker. Milan cannot offer Champions League football so it feels like that particular ship has sailed.",
      "",
      "7) Juventus\nAnother throwback to those January rumours, Juventus have not been linked ahead of the summer but should they sneak back into the Champions League – it will be tight – they could become an option once again.",
      "",
      "8) Borussia Dortmund\nThey pushed and they pushed hard in January, hoping to recreate the Jadon Sancho magic. But right now they are in the Aston Villa position of being rather more likely to land in the Conference League than Champions League.",
      "",
      "",

      "Fixing Manchester United must appeal to new signings, while Trent Alexander-Arnold’s Liverpool decision has reinforced the eternal No 1) on this ranking.",
      "",
      "20) Bournemouth\nBy making their unspoken role as a transfer stepping stone a part of their actual identity, Bournemouth have established themselves as a destination worth considering for any aspiring player.",
      "A self-described “platform club” who have proven capable of not only coaching and developing to an elite standard but also being willing to sell when the time is right is particularly appealing, not least to agents who might project bigger moves down the line.",
      "And there is an undeniable pull to working with Andoni Iraola, who could deliver European football next season and crucially stay for that part of an exciting journey.",
      "",
      "19) RB Leipzig\nIt is a similar situation at Leipzig, whose very purpose as the finishing school of the Red Bull institution is to polish the gems inherited elsewhere from within their multi-club ownership model and move them on to Europe’s elite for ludicrous profit.",
      "“We are confirming it every single summer in every transfer window, we are the perfect club for young players, to help them for a certain time in their career and then to bring them to absolutely top clubs,” said Leipzig managing director of sport Marcel Schafer last year.",
      "There is now also the remote prospect of at least entering the same orbit as that massive sell-out Jurgen Klopp.",
      "",
      "18) Spurs\nThe notion of a Big Six remains contentious for many but it has almost never been the actual best six because that isn’t the point.",
      "The crisis baton is passed and often shared between Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester City, Manchester United and Spurs, whose competence levels have rarely converged over the last decade. Yet they remain far and away the richest clubs in the Premier League with the clearest in-built advantages. Spurs lag behind the other five in that respect, but in the same vein every other club in the country – and most across Europe – cannot touch Spurs in terms of infrastructure.",
      "Their shift towards a focus on signing younger talents and helping them evolve is also enticing, although the managerial situation will need to be clarified soon. With that said, as naive, foolish and prickly as Ange Postecoglou can be, his philosophy has proved compelling to players at a base level.",
      "",
      "17) Atalanta\nThere are inherent flaws in basing a career move on a desire to work with one specific coach, especially when said coach is approaching 70 and has already publicly said he will not extend a contract which expires at the end of this season.",
      "But an exception could be made for Gian Piero Gasperini if the one-year option in his deal is triggered and his spell at Atalanta is taken into a tenth year next season. Their rise under his guidance from mid-table fodder to title challengers and even Europa League winners playing some of the most exciting, admirable football on the continent has been stunning.",
      "If he does leave, the structure is in place for Atalanta to keep punching above their weight with the right appointment.",
      "MORE EUROPEAN COVERAGE FROM F365\n👉 Raphinha v Yamal v Dembele for the Ballon d’Or after Inter beat Barcelona\n👉 The £400m+ transfers which could be rushed through early in ‘exceptional’ window for Club World Cup",
      "",
      "16) Juventus\nThere is no better place to go in Italy if money is a driving factor, with Juventus claiming the highest wage bill in Serie A. But the Old Lady has shown her age somewhat in these fallow post-Scudetto years, being overtaken by a handful of clubs run more capably.",
      "This remains a team in transition, with uncertainty over their manager, sporting director and a transfer policy still contingent on player churn and loans with various clauses attached.",
      "The name value and reputation undoubtedly remains but Juventus have also not made the Champions League quarter-finals since 2019 and have two Coppas Italia to show for the last five seasons.",
      "",
      "15) Benfica\nThe best sellers in world football this century, with a Champions League stage and plenty of domestic trophies to offer while being moulded into an auction-worthy star. The model works for a reason.",
      "",
      "14) Newcastle United\nThere is an undoubted upward trajectory to Newcastle which could prove impossible to resist for any player who wishes to be part of something meaningful – and financially lucrative.",
      "It is easy and indeed often necessary to challenge the perception of Newcastle as unique in their football-obsessive nature, but also Dan Burn will probably have a trophy outside St James’ Park when all is said and done and he just scored in a Carabao Cup final; imagine how the player who delivers a Premier League title or European glory will be celebrated and commemorated.",
      "Newcastle do not feel far off becoming frequent Champions League qualifiers and an established domestic force, with regular loads of sportswashing capable of reinforcing that position once they finally get there.",
      "",
      "13) Atletico Madrid\nThere’s no shame in Atletico having basically one trump card to play that no other team can boast. Diego Simeone is their ace, their only feasible edge in any transfer race competed on even footing against other Champions League regulars. And he is going nowhere, probably even when Arsenal come calling.",
      "",
      "12) Napoli\nThe lure of sitting under the Scott McTominay learning tree cannot be sniffed at but there is a definite elephant in the room when it comes to Napoli’s transfer lure.",
      "Antonio Conte is simultaneously their biggest pull and most prominent red flag for prospective signings. Napoli are on course to win Serie A for the second time in three seasons but with a managerial ticking time bomb liable to go off any time soon, and the volatile Aurelio De Laurentiis still in a position of power, it would be a risk to join even with their renewed offering of Champions League football.",
      "",
      "11) Manchester United\nDo not underestimate the allure of being the player who can rouse a sleeping giant. Manchester United could do worse than making it part of their negotiation pitch that incoming signings might be the one player who can fix them. Bruno Fernandes committing the best years of his career to a certified basket case proves it can work.",
      "Things have obviously changed since Robinho was caught off-guard by the revelation that there were two Premier League clubs based in Manchester, and United have been drowned out by many more teams than their noisy neighbours.",
      "But they can still genuinely compete with the best in the transfer market in spite of their own failings, and if more than a decade of general irrelevancy has done little to change that then nothing will.",
      "",
      "10) Borussia Dortmund\nThe established cliche used to be that Bayern would sign the best players from Dortmund, who in turn would shop in the smaller Bundesliga markets. But it doesn’t really apply anymore, with free agent Raphael Guerreiro the only player since 2016 to cross the divide and leave Germany’s second-biggest fish for the bona fide shark.",
      "Dortmund cannot even lay consistent claim to being the country’s perennial bridesmaid. They have finished 3rd, 4th or 5th as often as they have 2nd in the last eight Bundesliga seasons, and are currently losing the fight to qualify for the Champions League.",
      "They are still Dortmund and the idea of following in the footsteps of Erling Haaland and Jude Bellingham works in their favour. But the further smaller those examples in the rear window, the better chance Leverkusen have of usurping them.",
      "",
      "9) Chelsea\n“I don’t why as a player I would look at that Chelsea project and think I would sign,” said Jamie Carragher last August. But really the reasons are numerous and obvious when looking past the instinct of laughing at how batsh*t it all is: money, a long-term contract, a chance to work with excellent players and coaches, regular European football, trophy-winning pedigree and life in London.",
      "There might be an element of reticence to join a club which has shown such scant and consistent disregard for players it no longer deems of value, but that rather ignores the ingrained egotism of professional athletes who believe they are so good that such treatment will never befall them.",
      "",
      "8) Inter\nChampions League finalists in two of the last three seasons, Inter have been meticulously and impressively rebuilt in the image of Simone Inzaghi and Beppe Marotta. But throwing any sort of financial weight around has not really been their thing since the ludicrous spending of the 1990s.",
      "While they have some obvious incentives to offer, it ultimately tends to come down to money and Inter are perfectly happy to target players eager to join them for sporting reasons instead.",
      "",
      "7) Bayern Munich\nThere isn’t really a box Bayern don’t tick. They have a ridiculous economic advantage in a league they are favourites to win each season, with a raft of brilliant players, a wonderful stadium, the guarantee of Champions League football every year and a charismatic coach.",
      "As the breakers of the Harry Kane trophy curse the only thing that can possibly stand against them is a bias towards Premier League teams, but the capture of England’s captain, Jamal Musiala and Michael Olise against intense competition shows that they can hold their own in those battles.",
      "",
      "6) Arsenal\nOne of the crucial factors behind Arsenal’s club-record signing of Declan Rice – probably their last uncontestably brilliant transfer and definitely one of few they have had to compete against other teams for – will only apply for so long.",
      "It was said that Rice was tempted to join Arsenal over Manchester City because Mikel Arteta’s pitch involved the midfielder being ‘the driving force to take his young side to the next level’, the alternative being a role as one of many cogs in the Etihad machine. He was, if not the final piece in the Gunners jigsaw, then one of the last. And that plays to a player’s self-worth.",
      "But Arsenal will need to deliver on that promise at some point; the trophy tilts must be converted into something tangible for the process to work, not least because these near-misses undermine the reign of Arteta. It happened again in Paris.",
      "",
      "5) Manchester City\nAnd for some, being an Etihad cog is a fine and fair trade-off for the opportunity to work under Pep Guardiola, win trophies and be paid handsomely for the privilege.",
      "While Guardiola and the owners are there, Manchester City have two distinct advantages over most when all things are otherwise even. That could change when the former leaves and absolutely would if the latter ever does, but Erling Haaland responded to the looming threat of demotions by signing a 1o-year contract so they will probably be fine.",
      "",
      "4) Liverpool\nThey might not be the sexiest option in the Premier League but they do feel like the most sensible and stable. Klopp left behind some strong foundations and Liverpool have a higher floor than most others as a result, while Arne Slot is still trying to find their ceiling.",
      "Liverpool have finished in the Premier League top five in each of the last nine seasons and played Champions League football in seven of those. The champions they may be, but there are enough gaps in that starting XI for prospective signings to think they can break through.",
      "",
      "3) Barcelona\nThe appointment of Hansi Flick has certainly helped Barcelona regain their footing in the world game, although the emergence of some ludicrously gifted academy products might have played a part too.",
      "There remain some doubts over whether they can actually afford to register the players they sign, and the definitely absolutely certainly real corruption against them could put some off, but if any iteration of Barca come knocking you answer, and this one is finally taking steps to sort itself out.",
      "",
      "2) PSG\nThe one mark PSG had against them might soon be erased by the brilliance of Luis Enrique. Their inability to convert domestic hegemony into European glory has haunted them for years but a shift away from relying on superstars to emphasise instead the importance of the team has transformed them into the strongest unit the Parc des Princes has ever produced.",
      "They pay the highest wages and basically guarantee a couple of trophies a season when all is said and done, making it slightly easier to grin and bear living in actual Paris for a bit.",
      "",
      "1) Real Madrid\nStill the one club no-one turns down. Even in big 2025 that concept is alien to some who believe their club, players or supporters are special and different enough to counteract decades of self-fulfilling importance. They are not and never will be.",
      "Real Madrid shattered the world transfer record to sign Cristiano Ronaldo from Champions League runners-up Manchester United at the end of a season in which they were eliminated 5-0 on aggregate by Liverpool in the round of 16, lost in the first round of the Copa del Rey to Real Union and finished a distant second to Barcelona in La Liga.",
      "They have tempted Trent Alexander-Arnold into ending a 21-year union with the Reds despite being comfortably beaten in this campaign’s quarter-finals by Arsenal and very likely ending up with a new manager and no trophies of note.",
      "It’s not personal and it’s not an insult. Real Madrid just tend to get what they want."

      "Manchester United legends Gary Neville and David Beckham have ‘completed a takeover’ of Salford City worth around £15m as part of a ‘new consortium’.",
      "In 2014, Neville and fellow Class of ’92 members Beckham, Ryan Giggs, Paul Scholes, Phil Neville and Nicky Butt bought non-league side Salford City as part of a consortium which included businessman Peter Lim.",
      "Neville and Co. oversaw a rapid rise as Salford City earned four promotions in five years to reach League Two, but the club has stagnated in recent seasons.",

      "Now, Salford chiefs have recognised that changes are necessary, with The Athletic‘s David Ornstein revealing Neville and Beckham are part of a ‘new consortium’ in control of the club.",
      "His report confirms Butt, Giggs, Neville and Scholes have ‘relinquished their stakes, but will continue to occupy various positions at Moor Lane’.",
      "It is noted that Neville and Beckham have been ‘seeking investment partners’ since Lim’s exit from Salford City in 2024 and they ‘plan on lifting the club to new heights’ amid their ‘commitment to injecting significant funds’.",

      "After ‘considering multi-club models and a direct owner’, Neville and Beckham ‘decided to join forces with Declan Kelly, founder of U.S.-based advisory firm Consello, and Lord Mervyn Davies, chairman of the Lawn Tennis Association’, who ‘will co-chair Salford’s board of directors’.",
      "Regarding Salford City’s Championship plans, the report adds:",
      "‘The collective are believed to have raised around $15-20million [approx £15m at most] to boost Salford’s sporting and infrastructural ambitions over the next five years. Inside that timeframe they are targeting promotion to the Championship.",
      "‘Each member will hold a 5 per cent or 10 per cent stake, totalling at 80 per cent. The remaining 20 per cent has been earmarked for additional partners.",
      "‘None of them will have day-to-day involvement — interviews are taking place to appoint a chief executive and that person will drive matters on the ground — but their influence is set to be felt across the operation.’",
      "Roy Keane and Gary Neville agree with Arsene Wenger’s call for a UEFA rules change which would cost both Manchester United and Tottenham.",

      "Marcus Rashford has not ruled out a Man Utd return and could embark on the sort of redemption arc which embarrassed Real Madrid and Jose Mourinho."

      "Manchester United have sent Torino into a ‘panic’ over goalkeeper Vanja Milinkovic-Savic after Fabrizio Romano revealed ‘initial contacts’ have been held over his summer transfer.",
      "United are scouring the market for alternatives to Andre Onana and Altay Bayindir after a difficult season for the stoppers at Old Trafford.",
      "A number of high-profile errors from Onana, most notably in the Europa League first leg against Lyon, led to Amorim dropping the Cameroon international from the starting XI, with his understudy failing to convince between the sticks either.",
      "And transfer expert Romano told GIVEMESPORT this week that Milinkovic-Savic has emerged as a potential option after an outstanding season for Torino.",
      "‘Manchester United are preparing an important summer transfer window with several movements expected. It’s not only Matheus Cunha as the club has started making contact over other potential targets ahead of the upcoming months.",
      "‘One of the positions to follow will surely be the goalkeeper; it’s not an urgent priority compared to other positions in the team, but for sure it is one of many roles Man United want to cover in the summer.",
      "‘Torino goalkeeper Vanja Milinkovic-Savic has recently been added to the list at Man United also with initial contacts made to explore a potential summer move, based on the price tag wanted by the Italian club for their Serbian goalkeeper.’",
      "The 28-year-old has a release clause of just €20m (£17m) which applies to foreign clubs, and Italian outlet Tuttomercatoweb has confirmed the Red Devils’ interest while revealing the club’s owner, Urbana Cairo, is now in a state of ‘panic’ as he pushes for the goalkeeper to sign a new deal at the club.",
      "‘The Red Devils, in fact, carried out the first surveys, well aware that in the Serbian contract there is a clause of around 20 million euros valid only for abroad.",
      "‘That’s why President Cairo wants to sit around the table with Milinkovic-Savic as soon as possible: the goal is to find a new agreement to remove, or at least raise it to higher figures, this sword of Damocles.’",
      "The report offers United a boost in their bid to sign Milinkovic-Savic by revealing that Torino are currently looking at options to replace the 6ft 8in star, including former Liverpool goalkeeper Loris Karius, whose Schalke contract expires this summer, and Sampdoria’s Jonathan Klinsmann.",
      "Chelsea and Manchester United have also been credited with interest, but United may hold the advantage having signed Milinkovic-Savic back in 2014, only for the then teenager to be released due to a work permit issue."

      "Alejandro Garnacho admits he “listens to some rumours about the future” amid Manchester United exit reports and claims Ruben Amorim’s arrival mid-season made things “difficult”.",
      "Garnacho has been linked with a move to Chelsea or Napoli this summer after both clubs showed previous interest in the forward, with United reportedly demanding at least £65million for the 20-year-old.",
      "Responding to the reports ahead of his side’s crunch clash against Athletic Club in the Europa League, Garnacho said: “Obviously as a footballer you read and listen to some rumours about the future, but I have a contract here until 2028. I am happy here.",
      "“We know we have to work hard here to be even in the squad and I just have to train well every day and I will be available for all the games.”",
      "United are languishing in 15th place in the Premier League after a miserable domestic season which has seen them win just ten of their 35 games.",
      "Erik ten Hag was replaced by Amorim in November but the results and performances have if anything deteriorated following the Portuguese manager’s arrival.",
      "Amorim has stuck rigidly to his philosophy and Garnacho has been one of many players who have struggled to adapt.",
      "“I think it’s difficult for everyone when, in the middle of the season, a new manager comes in and we change the formation,” Garnancho explained. “But we just need to follow the rules and I try to improve every day.",
      "“Obviously, the manager knows the characteristics of the players. You see the games, too many times I play, for example, wide on the wing and the wing back is coming inside. What we try to do depends on the players we have and we are improving as a team also.",
      "“It’s a little bit hard but it’s just the mentality. My first two months, November and December were very difficult for me but my mentality is to keep working, to keep trying and show to the manager and staff I have to play.”",
      "👉 Man Utd ‘flag’ ex-PL flop in ‘renaissance’ on four-striker ‘shortlist’ with ‘clause’ only active for 15 days 👉 Liverpool make Mason Greenwood ‘top target’ to replace exit-bound Reds star in boost for Man Utd",
      "Garnacho’s strike in the 4-3 defeat to Brentford on Sunday took him to 24 United goal involvements, one away from matching Cristiano Ronaldo’s tally before reaching the age of 21.",
      "With the Argentina international not celebrating his birthday until July, there’s every chance he can equal or even surpass the United legend, but Garnacho insists he’s only focused on improving to help his team.",
      "But, for now, Garnacho is concentrating on the here and now, as United prepare for the Europa League second leg against Athletic Club at Old Trafford.",
      "“I’m not focused on the numbers. I think when Cristiano played here, he was a different footballer, [they were] a different type of games,” he said, at Wednesday’s press conference. “I just try to help the team and try to win games.",
      "“Obviously, yeah, on missed chances and things like this, we are training really hard, me, Rasmus [Hojlund] and all the strikers in the team, so I think we are improving and we will try to do better.”",
      "United won their first leg 3-0 in Bilbao and have a great chance of reaching the Europa League final and Garnacho says he’s working hard with Hojlund – who’s been particularly poor in front of goal this season – to improve their output.",
      "“I speak with him a lot. We try to help each other,” he added. “Sometimes, from this side, it’s difficult but we try hard, try harder every game to try to score more of these chances, and the team will improve if we score more goals.",
      "“We know that we are not doing a great job in the Premier League. But the manager said before that we have followed the rules and tomorrow is a final, and we will face it like it is 0-0.",
      "“If we win the Europa League, we will be in the Champions League and we will face next season with a different mentality and in a different way.”",
      "Paul Scholes has hit out at the Manchester United forward for frequently making “wrong decisions” and outlined his “fear” ahead of the summer.",
      "Man Utd defender Harry Maguire is one of four Red Devils stars ‘immune’ to their ‘fire sale’ in the summer transfer window, according to reports.",
      "Garnacho leaving Man Utd this summer is “highly possible” according to David Ornstein, who named six other “plausible” exits and two who “will leave the wage bill”.",
      "Manchester United are in a ‘strong position’ to sign Wolves attacker Matheus Cunha in the summer, according to transfer expert David Ornstein.",
      "Man Utd winger Alejandro Garnacho is ‘not interested’ in staying at Old Trafford if Wolves forward Matheus Cunha joins, according to reports.",
      "Chelsea are interested in signing Kobbie Mainoo and Alejandro Garnacho from Manchester United this summer, according to reports."

      "We haven’t updated the manager rankings for a bit, so we’re sneaking a quick update – you know, just the 7000 or so words – before doing a full and proper job on it when the season ends.",
      "It is, of course, the most scientific and rigorous of endeavours so if you find yourself disagreeing with anyone’s placing simply know and understand you just aren’t as clever as the supercomputer we pumped full of data to deliver results absolutely none of which are as silly as when we accidentally had Kieran McKenna seventh last time.",
      "You can read that malfunction and the rest of the last update here if you absolutely must, but the TL;DR placings are in the brackets below.",
      "",
      "30) Erik Ten Hag, Man United August-October (28)\nShould obviously have been sacked in the summer, could very easily have been sacked after either of the two grimmest thrashings – Liverpool and Spurs – and arguably most compellingly of all should have gone after trying to convince himself and the world that a 0-0 draw at Crystal Palace was evidence of anything much at all about his future prospects.",
      "As we said after he was eventually put out of our collective misery last year:",
      "As is very often the case for a flailing manager – especially at the biggest clubs – he is not really the biggest problem but nor does he show any hint of being in any way part of a possible solution.",
      "The football is uninspiring and, much as we hate the phrase, increasingly small time. Ten Hag’s confidence has shrunk to the point that he no longer feels able to take his team to a place like Aston Villa and do anything more than cling grimly to the 0-0 he started with.",
      "There are teams where you can justifiably point to hard-earned, backs-to-the-wall goalless draws at Crystal Palace and Aston Villa as evidence that you know what you are doing and are going to get the job done, but Manchester United surely cannot ever be one of those clubs.",
      "The irony, of course, is that a man who spent a large part of the second half of his United managerial career desperately insisting that results be ignored finally did get the tin-tack after a result that on its own probably could have been ignored.",
      "Given the chances United missed – Diogo Dalot’s in particular was one for the all-time list and probably not really Ten Hag’s fault if we’re being fair about it – and the genuine absurdity of the penalty that eventually settled it, there is a strong case to be made that West Ham 2-1 Man United is the most easily dismissed result in the Premier League since Tottenham 2-1 Liverpool.",
      "It wasn’t quite as abysmal a bit of officiating as that one, but it was arguably worse because a) it came so late in the piece and b) represented VAR actively changing a perfectly fine decision rather than a failure – however ludicrous – to overturn an error that already existed.",
      "But when you have somehow come out the other side of at least four clear sacking windows as Ten Hag so obviously had, the sympathy that exists for getting the boot during an altogether more opaque one can only be very limited indeed. He had to go, and even United’s struggles to adapt to life under Ruben Amorim don’t really offer much vindication for Ten Hag given that so much of that struggle is down to the squad rot – both in personnel and mindset – that was allowed to fester during his time.",
      "",
      "29) Ivan Juric, Southampton, December-April (27)\nBeing both appointed and sacked by two clubs during one season is novel, even for a manager who has now had nine managerial jobs and lasted less than 50 games in seven of them, including all three of his spells as Genoa manager between June 2016 and December 2018.",
      "No wonder he had itchy feet after three whole seasons at Torino, who he left last summer before taking over at Roma in September, being sacked in November, then taking over at Southampton in December before again being sacked in April. Slightly disappointing he hasn’t managed to squeeze in another job in Italy before the season finishes, if we’re being brutally honest.",
      "His Southampton reign was a failure, obviously. But it didn’t have to be quite so hefty a failure, surely. Not managing to save them from themselves is one thing, being really no better than Martin in any significantly measurable way and statistically inferior to Simon Rusk, the caretaker who preceded and followed him, is not a good look.",
      "",
      "28) Russell Martin, Southampton, August-November (26)\nYou can’t blame a guy for trying, can you? Having sat and watched Vincent Kompany brazenly and above all successfully place his own career prospects several levels above Burnley’s survival prospects last season, you can forgive Russell Martin for wanting a slice of that pie having surprised many by steering Southampton back to the top flight.",
      "The problem is that Southampton were even less suited to trying to Pepball their way around the Barclays than Burnley. Burnley had at least cruised through the Championship in dominant fashion; Southampton scraped up through the play-offs after an end to the season in which even a relegation-haunted Huddersfield had scared the living sh*t out of them.",
      "And lo it came to pass that Southampton were not capable of passing Premier League sides to death. There is a wider point here about wanting to do this.",
      "It’s something that now-established teams like Brighton and Brentford didn’t do when they first came up. They showed the Barclays some damn respect. These days everyone wants everything instantly, and these teams and managers think they can just saunter on in here and started passing out from the back from day one.",
      "The utter and total failure of Southampton and Martin, who we fear remains unlikely to be the next manager of Bayern Munich despite his impeccable credentials, should at least serve as a warning to others.",
      "READ: Promoted clubs’ predictable relegation is a further sign the Premier League has broken English football",
      "",
      "27) Julen Lopetegui, West Ham August-January (25)\nGetting rid of David Moyes in the hope of finding something a bit more proactive and enjoyable and then replacing him with the Spanish Moyes was always an interesting choice from a club that deals almost exclusively in interesting choices, but it’s still been striking to watch just how badly it’s gone and in such Moyesian fashion.",
      "The worst of Moyes’ West Ham were so, so similar to the worst of Lopetegui’s: unnecessarily painful to watch given the talent available, but also and more damningly utterly ineffectively painful to watch. The 4-1 defeat at Man City was the ninth league game out of 20 this season in which the Hammers had conceded at least three goals.",
      "It could only ever end one way, and given how bad West Ham have been you do almost have to hand it to the way the people running that club managed to make Lopetegui look like a wounded victim by making such a complete bollocks of his very necessary departure. Sacking managers is part of the game, but you can still do it with some dignity and grace.",
      "Making the poor sod take training on the morning of a day he knows is going to be his last was just deeply weird, deeply unpleasant behaviour. It makes no sense unless viewed as some kind of desperate ploy to enrage Lopetegui to the point that he might jump before they had to push him.",
      "",
      "26) Ben Dawson, Leicester, November-December (24)\nLeft Newcastle in the summer after 15 years in various academy and age-group coaching roles for a job on Steve Cooper’s coaching team at Leicester. Might have been an error. Named caretaker following Cooper’s departure, he oversaw a 4-1 defeat at Brentford before handing the reins to Ruud van Nistelrooy.",
      "",
      "25) Gary O’Neil, Wolves, August-December (23)\nAn apparent recovery on the back of two straight wins and a four-game unbeaten run in October and November crashed and burned spectacularly as Wolves lost three straight games, one of which involved the genuinely weirdly impressive achievement of conceding four goals to Everton.",
      "O’Neil’s job was very much on the line ahead of a home game with Ipswich, one that ended with a late winner for Wolves’ relegation rivals and star man Matheus Cunha getting fisty with stewards. So, on balance, a sub-optimal run of form and antics. It felt like the end. It was the end.",
      "And now we don’t really know what happens next for O’Neil. He’s a man who has now completed two genuinely impressive firefighting jobs from hospital passes (need a police reference here really don’t we, but buggered if we can think of one) at first Bournemouth and then Wolves. But having been replaced to such great effect at Bournemouth by Andoni Iraola and now having made a right bollocks of things at Wolves after his first stab at an actual pre-season of proper preparation he might just be a bit stuck.",
      "To make matters worse, he has now been even more swiftly and conspicuously outperformed by his replacement at Molineux than he was at the Vitality.",
      "There are presumably two kinds of jobs that now exist for O’Neil’s next foray. One, another desperate Premier League club enlists his proven relegation-avoiding credentials but that means waiting until someone like West Ham sh*t themselves with panic in around October.",
      "Two, and perhaps more likely, an upwardly-mobile ambitious Championship club tasks him with doing the ‘getting into the Premier League’ bit before his specialist subject of ‘staying in the Premier League’, which is now so difficult for promoted clubs that it is essentially witchcraft.",
      "What we do know for certain is that O’Neil will get the job on the back of some fine video screen analysis and Speaking Well, I Thought on Monday Night Football.",
      "",
      "24) Ruud van Nistelrooy, Leicester, December onwards (21)\nA fun little bit from this season has been Ruud van Nistelrooy being at the heart of both the best and worst bits of decision-making all season long.",
      "Manchester United haven’t got much right this year, but appointing a bona-fide club legend as interim manager to chuck in a few mood-boosting results before swiftly and correctly replacing him before it all went horribly sour – as all manner of subsequent evidence suggests it absolutely and entirely would have – suggests that at least someone somewhere at that daft club learned something from the Solskjaer years.",
      "One of the main reasons to doubt the sustainability of Van Nistelrooy’s United bounce was the fact that two of his four games and two of his three wins came against Leicester.",
      "This appears to have been a factor in Leicester’s decision to appoint him manager. Which at first glance appears understandable but only gets more weird the more you think about it. Why appoint a manager based on the fact he has proved he can beat you, when that is the one thing he can never, ever do in the job you’ve just given him?",
      "Although, we guess, actually he kind of did. He oversaw two games in which United beat Leicester while he was United boss, and then did the same again as Leicester boss. We should have expected no different.",
      "Hard to see him staying on for the attempt to get Leicester back into the Premier League next year, but if he does walk away he does so as the proud owner of one of the more compelling examples of The Joke Is Always On Spurs.",
      "Van Nistelrooy’s effort was so long and repetitive that even Stewart Lee might have rejected it, with 15 defeats scattered either side of Leicester’s 2-1 win at Spurs. After the two goals early in the second half of that one they abandoned goalscoring altogether for more than two months.",
      "That 16-match, four-months-in-the-making joke is also bookended by a pair of 2-2 draws with Brighton, which means that, we guess, the joke is also always a tiny bit on Brighton for some reason. Maybe needs some more digging, that one.",
      "READ: Ranking this season’s Premier League managerial changes from Vitor to Ruud",
      "",
      "23) Sean Dyche, Everton, August-January (20)\nThe last manager rankings were compiled just days before Everton gave Dyche the Spanish Archer, and if you’ll indulge us we would like to revel in this rare example of us having got the situation pretty much spot on.",
      "Current Sack Race favourite and you have to say that’s fair enough. There really isn’t any compelling excuse for Everton to be slumming it like this in a grimly miserable relegation scrap again, and if Dyche cannot build a coherent case that he’s the best man to keep them above the relegation waterline, then really what is the point?",
      "The belligerent run of spoiling draws against City, Arsenal and Chelsea is starting to look more and more like a defiant but futile last hurrah for Dyche’s particular brand of misery with Everton increasingly inclined to look elsewhere for a manager who might do more than drag them a point above the relegation zone with such misery-inducing football. Feels like for a club of Everton’s history and stature you might be able to get away with flirting with relegation and you might be able to get away with football that makes the ears bleed, but you can only do both for so long before it just becomes demeaning for all concerned.",
      "Everton finally losing their long and proudly-held top-tier record the precise moment they move into a shiny new stadium is just far too Everton a piece of behaviour to be ruled out, and it does look more and more like it might need a change of direction, a change of mood, and a change of manager to prevent that nightmare scenario becoming horrifyingly real.",
      "What Everton have subsequently achieved under David Moyes – even if the new manager bounce has inevitably lost a bit of air from its glorious early days – damns Dyche further.",
      "He really did have them in a full-blown relegation scrap, in this Premier League season of all Premier League seasons, and wasn’t even going about it in entertaining fashion.",
      "",
      "22) Steve Cooper, Leicester August-November (22)\n‘Nobody is currently talking about Steve Cooper’ we chirped in November. Turns out we just weren’t listening. He was gone within days, with nobody much happy with the sufferball on offer even though it was keeping Leicester very much afloat in a choppy and complicated relegation fight.",
      "The timing of his dismissal was odd, coming as it did after a narrow defeat to Chelsea straight after the international break that rather indicated he was already done for and a new manager could have been given a bit more time during that break to get his feet under the desk.",
      "All became clearer, mind, when Ruud van Nistelrooy – who only completed his interim duties at Manchester United at said international break – was the man anointed as the saviour of Leicester’s season just after inflicting a couple of sizeable blows upon it with the Foxes’ relegation rivals United.",
      "It went… poorly.",
      "",
      "21) Graham Potter, West Ham, January onwards (15)\nFeels like a much better post-Moyes fit for the Hammers than Julen Lopetegui ever did, and we retain hope that it will all work out in the end. But uncomfortably and unavoidably true it is not working out currently for a team whose current eight-game run without a win includes the twin embarrassments of home draws against both Southampton and a barely-interested Spurs.",
      "Potter should be better than this. West Ham should be better than this. They are currently just about the only team really giving the incoming promoted sides hope that the story of the last couple of seasons can change.",
      "And that’s a pretty embarrassing state of affairs for both club and manager. The start of a season is obviously always important for all sorts of managers for all sorts of reasons, but those early weeks of next season right now feel more important for Potter than anyone else in this league.",
      "",
      "20) Kieran McKenna, Ipswich (7)\nSeventh? Ahem. Sorry about that. A giddiness that we are now attributing to a desperate desire for at least one of the promoted trio to give survival a real shot. Even back in January it was clear Ipswich offered the best/only hope of that, but they too have ultimately come up well short.",
      "It does feel like over the season as a whole they have been more consistently more competitive than the other two, and unlike both Leicester and Southampton there is a decent body of evidence to go with a gut feel that they still have the right man in charge to try and earn them another chance back in the top flight next season.",
      "Luton remain the warning from history there, but for now McKenna has just about emerged from this season with reputation intact if not perhaps enhanced in the way he might have hoped or expected.",
      "",
      "19) Ange Postecoglou, Tottenham (19)\nOne of two potential absolute noodle-scratchers when the final rankings are put together a month from now.",
      "But while it is Ruben Amorim who insists winning the Europa League cannot save United’s season, it’s really Postecoglou for whom it feels more of a sticking plaster over a gaping wound.",
      "It’s not to say it wouldn’t be a huge achievement – and Spurs’ recent performances in the latter stages of the competition have been pretty compelling – and it would absolutely be a huge deal for Spurs as a whole.",
      "But could it or should it save Postecoglou? We’re really not sure it should. If the Europa League efforts offer some mitigation for both the poor recent league results and the shoddiness of the returns during their injury crisis, they also damn Postecoglou as well.",
      "Because it should never have got that bad during the injury problems and it should never have remained this bad when the injured players returned, Europa distractions or no Europa distractions.",
      "There’s also the sticky issue of how and why he’s been able to coax such whole-hearted performances out of this squad on Europa League nights but not in the Premier League.",
      "United and Spurs have probably benefited from the presence of each other in the same unexpected area of the league table this season, each serving to normalise the ridiculousness of the other.",
      "But it is Postecoglou who has less excuse for being there. He’s in the second full season of his plan, and the fact a 17th-place finish remains entirely possible is a stain that not even winning the Europa could or should wash away entirely.",
      "Tottenham’s league form has now been absolutely rotten for a strikingly long time; since the heady days of those first 10 games of last season in which Ange’s swashbucklers picked up eight wins and two draws they’ve managed only 78 points from 63 games, very nearly half of which have been lost.",
      "To put that in full perspective; those first 10 games of last season still account for a quarter of all Postecoglou’s Premier League points. Even including that run with its eight wins and no defeats he has still has just as many losses as wins in the Premier League.",
      "Winning the Europa League might still save his job for now, especially with Spurs’ much-discussed record when it comes to such things, but we will be staggered if he starts 2026 as Spurs manager.",
      "",
      "18) Ruben Amorim, Manchester United, November onwards (18)\nThe pure absurdity of the Europa League run is doing a lot of heavy lifting and the fact we’ve now reached the point where United winning it and thus securing a third silverware-winning season in a row despite being increasingly dreadful has just about tipped over from possibility to probability is absolutely wild.",
      "But this remains one of the most clear-cut cautionary tales this division has ever served up. Man United got it wrong last summer and Amorim got it wrong in failing to call United’s bluff when they insisted it was now or never in November. He should have stayed with Sporting like he wanted to, and backed himself to have opportunities at least as good as this one – even very probably this precise one – come the summer.",
      "He could also absolutely have shown at least hints of flexibility in acknowledging the squad was not up to the challenge of what he would be demanding.",
      "It’s not his fault that United’s squad was left technically, physically and mentally weak by previous managers and regimes, but it is still his fault that he didn’t recognise that at the outset or accept the reality of it during the season.",
      "The sheer incompetence of the teams below United has prevented things becoming even worse, but his Premier League record is miserable and it’s going to take one heck of a summer to offer any meaningful resolution. The full rebuild required is going to take at least a couple more windows beyond that.",
      "The Europa League run has been spectacularly entertaining throughout, but the starkest of facts is in that league form. United have won only twice since January, against Ipswich and Leicester. If next season begins anything like the way this one is ending, Amorim will be in big trouble very quickly and that silverware will not save him.",
      "",
      "17) Simon Rusk, Southampton, December and April onwards (17)\nHis two brief interim stints have delivered over 18 per cent of Southampton’s Premier League points this season and 50 per cent of their clean sheets in 13 per cent of their games, thus making Rusk – stopgap between Russell Martin’s egocentric Kompany-lite stylings and whatever it is Ivan Juric was attempting to achieve and now between Juric and whatever comes next – comfortably Southampton’s most impressive manager of the season.",
      "Had Rusk been manager for the whole season it is a clear statistical certainty that they would now have 15 points and left Derby for dust. Undeniable facts.",
      "",
      "16) Leighton Baines and Seamus Coleman, Everton, January (NE)\nOne hundred per cent record after a 2-0 FA Cup third-round win over League One strugglers Peterborough in a sole game in charge before David Moyes’ glorious return, you’ll never sing that.",
      "",
      "15) Mikel Arteta, Arsenal (13)\nThis is going to be a season that contains all manner of awkward questions that will require addressing. Especially when it’s a season that carries still the prospect of Arsenal finishing third (or worse…) in a two-horse race and having to watch all the clubs joining them in the Champions League next season win silverware.",
      "Liverpool have a trophy. Newcastle have a trophy. Chelsea will probably have a trophy. Man City will probably have a trophy. And most humiliatingly of all, either Spurs or Man United will almost certainly have a trophy.",
      "It doesn’t spell the end of Arteta by any stretch, and we’ve talked before about just how hard it is to put together three title-challenging seasons in a row. It might well be that this was always Arsenal’s fallow season and it’s just the inadequacy of others that kept them artificially and deceptively high in the table.",
      "But there has been a clear regression in their league form, with a lack of the clinical ability to get the job done that marked them out as the real deal in the second half of last season. Points have been frittered carelessly and consistently with the injury problems providing at best partial mitigation only.",
      "It all makes next season feel like a decisive one for Arteta and his – still worth remembering, this – enormously ambitious plan to restore Arsenal to the summit of English football after a couple of decades away.",
      "It is not easy, this season has provided more questions than answers and exposed some familiar failings.",
      "",
      "14) Ruud van Nistelrooy, Man United, October-November (10)\nYeah, that genuinely went brilliantly well. Credit to everyone here. If we were going to have a four-match reign as Manchester United manager, what we’d do is to make sure that all four of those matches were at home and, ideally, two of them against Leicester and another against PAOK in the Europa League. Get some lovely fat wins under the belt.",
      "But let’s not pretend United would have won those three games as straightforwardly under Erik Ten Hag (or, it must now be conceded, Ruben Amorim) as they did under Ruud. It’s not really Ten Hag’s fault, but everything had become extremely stressful by that point. Absolutely nothing was coming easily, and maybe one of those three games might have been straightforward. But at least one would have been harrowing.",
      "And perhaps the most impressive result of Van Nistelrooy’s reign was the one game he didn’t win, with a 1-1 draw against Chelsea giving us far more information than some easy wins over dreck.",
      "Essentially, though, it was the perfect interim stint. It’s had all the positives of the initial Ole caretaker spell, with the instant mood-lifting morale boost of seeing a bona fide club legend in the hotseat, without any of the unpleasantness of mistakenly leaving him there for another two years after that initial buzz had entirely worn off.",
      "",
      "13) Oliver Glasner, Crystal Palace (14)\nA curious Premier League season in which Glasner’s side won none of their first eight games and now none of their most recent five means that they might somehow still fall short of that apparently impenetrable 50-point mark despite a run of 34 points in 17 games between December and early April. They now need a ticklish four points from games against Tottenham, Wolves and Liverpool if they are to raise their bat.",
      "But none of that will matter at all if Glasner can become the first Crystal Palace manager to win a major honour in the FA Cup final against a Man City side who despite recent improvements remain distinctly vulnerable.",
      "",
      "12) Fabian Hurzeler, Brighton (11)\nLook, this is probably still more of a Brighton thing than a Hurzeler thing but at some point they are simply going to have to decide whether they are any good or not. Until they make up their minds about this, how on earth are any of the rest of us supposed to do so?",
      "",
      "11) Pep Guardiola, Man City (16)\nExtremely plausible that this season now ends with a second-place league finish and a trophy. Which would be one heck of an outcome for a season that flirted for a serious amount of time with genuine disaster.",
      "At their lowest pre-Christmas ebb, City and Guardiola both appeared broken in a way that was dizzyingly unfixable. We’re still not truly convinced he’s fully recovered despite the improvement of results trending back towards something approaching City normality over recent months.",
      "We still feel like this is a season that has pushed him closer to the City exit door rather than convinced him he should hang around to build a new team to go again against Liverpool and Arsenal and whoever else can manage to put together more than a half-season’s worth of results.",
      "The impending departure of Kevin De Bruyne means the loss of another key stabilising, familiar reference point in Guardiola’s City adventure, and for so many reasons next season feels like one that holds more uncertainty for City than just about any other during his outrageously successful reign.",
      "",
      "10) David Moyes, Everton, January onwards (NE)\nPretty mad that we haven’t actually done an update since Moyes’ glorious homecoming to Everton, but it’s been one of the division’s more compelling good-news stories this year.",
      "The new-manager bounce is a real and unignorable phenomenon, but rarely have its effects been more pronounced than during that five-game, 13-point run just after Moyes’ came back to Goodison after 10 often difficult years away.",
      "The whole mood of the club was utterly transformed as the dread fear of relegation and losing that cherished and tightly held top-flight status just before moving into their stunning new ground gripped Everton fans.",
      "At the very least it appeared certain they faced another agonising end to the season in which relegation if it was to be averted would only be dismissed as a prospect late in the season.",
      "Instead it was pretty much off the table by mid-February with Everton instead allowed to spend the last few months giving their grand old ground the proper farewell it deserves without any of those intrusive thoughts about the worst-case scenario.",
      "Even if the highs of those early weeks have faded slightly among a flurry of draws – it’s now six and a solitary win in Everton’s last 10 games – the key work for this season at least had been done.",
      "Now, of course, for the next step. There is no plausible Everton manager more deserving, more worthy of taking them into their new life at their new ground. No manager who could more fully understand everything it means.",
      "But there remain few guarantees about how it will all pan out.",
      "",
      "9) Thomas Frank, Brentford (9)\nFrank is going to remain a top-10 staple for just about any next manager market worth the trouble but we remain entirely wedded to the idea that this is a club and manager in perfect harmony and the idea of either party risking their serendipitous relationship on something flashier is fraught with danger.",
      "It’s probably inevitable at some point, but it’s not something we like to think too hard about. In keeping with the other teams currently jockeying for positions 8 to 11 in the final table, it feels like theirs has been a season that doesn’t really deserve a bottom-half finish even though the cruel reality of maths demand that be somebody’s fate when the music stops.",
      "",
      "8) Enzo Maresca, Chelsea (5)\nIt’s not perhaps a satisfactory conclusion, but the one we find ourselves drawing is that Chelsea is simply a place where stuff happens and these days the manager is as much a passenger or bystander as anyone else.",
      "It doesn’t quite seem fair to heap either praise or derision on the fella trying to steer a course through the season at a club that spends so lavishly yet haphazardly.",
      "Maresca has made many mistakes, as a man with his lack of top-level experience was always likely to, but he’s got a lot right as well.",
      "And the fact that when the Champions League spot they had pretty much held all season came under pressure they have responded with a run of 20 points in nine games while remaining on track in the Conference isn’t to be sniffed at.",
      "In summary: Maresca is neither as good as his best nor as bad as his worst. Nothing means anything. It’s all just a bunch of stuff that happened.",
      "",
      "7) Marco Silva, Fulham (8)\nHis side just seem to have run out of puff a bit since the international break, and that’s a shame because until then Fulham appeared to have a very plausible chance to do something extraordinary.",
      "They have even in a weary phase that has delivered a crushing FA Cup defeat and four losses in six Premier League games still managed a thrilling win over Liverpool when that was still at least theoretically meaningful to all concerned.",
      "But it does now look like another mid-table finish for a club and manager that have finished 10th and 13th in the last two years. Again, there’s nothing wrong with that and none of the teams promoted since Fulham were joined by Bournemouth and Nottingham Forest two years has managed anything like it, but finishing 11th would now represent something of a disappointment given where they were and what seemed possible not that long ago.",
      "",
      "6) Unai Emery, Aston Villa (6)\nA tricky one now. Has that PSR-baiting January window been justified by what’s followed? This has been a season that has delivered memories for a lifetime, with Villa’s run to the Champions League quarter-finals an eye-catching one that remained thrilling to the very last moment.",
      "Villa fans have seen things they could surely never have expected to see at Villa Park with Marco Asensio and Marcus Rashford combining to give the club a hefty nudge into the second half of the season.",
      "But the likelihood now is that they will finish the season outside even the expanded Champions League places, without the silverware that other similarly equipped clubs will have to show for the campaign and with a sense that what they’ve built this season has been done ever so slightly on sand.",
      "That thumping defeat in the FA Cup semi-final is a really bruising one for Villa. And the way their season ends, with games against Tottenham and Man United, feels strangely apt too. Both clubs will offer a reminder that things could be so much worse, but one will also awkwardly show how things could also have ended up so much better.",
      "",
      "5) Andoni Iraola, Bournemouth (4)\nWe are acutely aware that there is little more annoying to fans of ‘smaller’ clubs than constant media narratives about anyone doing well with them heading off to one of the ‘bigger’ clubs. You only have to look at how upset Liverpool fans are about Trent Alexander-Arnold right now to see that.",
      "We take no joy in prodding at that sore spot and therefore apologise in advance here, but… of all the managers currently overperforming as manager of one of the Premier League’s burgeoning ‘middle-class’ clubs Iraola is the one we’d most like to see take the step up soon.",
      "Because we’re pretty sure he’s the most interesting. We’re pretty sure he’s the one with the greatest variety of possible outcomes.",
      "Placed in charge of one of the bigger beasts might bring the best or worst elements of his work to the surface. Or they might just continue to co-exist as they do now, only with attention shifting inevitably and inexorably to the dodgier parts.",
      "He’s been Bournemouth manager for two years now, and across that time they have almost always resembled either a team that could and should challenge for Europe or one that could and should be battling relegation. There is very little middle-ground.",
      "This is a team that completed a league double over Arsenal yet lost at home to Ipswich. A team that beat Newcastle and Nottingham Forest in successive weeks by an aggregate score of 9-1 to stretch their unbeaten run to 11 Premier League games and yet two months later found themselves on a run of one win (against Southampton…) in their next eight.",
      "In the last month alone they have suffered such embarrassments as failing to beat either West Ham or Man United, yet gone to the Emirates and prevailed.",
      "Their last three matches are against Aston Villa, Man City and Leicester and absolutely any result feels as likely as any other in any of those matches.",
      "And all of that is broadly fine at Bournemouth but brings a fascinating and chaotic dynamic to any club higher up the food chain.",
      "Essentially our point with Iraola is this: the exact season he’s produced for Bournemouth to great acclaim this season would be considered among the Spursiest things ever recorded if he were to repeat it at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium next season.",
      "For his own sanity and career he should not take that job, but we can’t help wondering what goes off if he does.",
      "",
      "4) Vitor Pereira, Wolves, December onwards (12)\nHas triggered an astonishing transformation in Wolves’ fortunes given the mess he inherited from Gary O’Neil.",
      "That start – nine points from the first 16 games of the season – ensured Wolves would be the last team to successfully extract themselves from the biggest non-event in Premier League relegation fight history, but when it happened it happened with absurd speed.",
      "It’s entirely true that Wolves’ squad is not one that should have been in the mess that it was, but nor was it one that could have been expected to so adroitly streak not just clear of the relegation zone but beyond the lower-mid-table stragglers like United, Spurs, Everton and West Ham into comfy mid-table.",
      "And as we’ve noted before: imagine the coverage both Pereira and O’Neil would be getting now had their stories this season been reversed.",
      "",
      "3) Eddie Howe, Newcastle (3)\nIn terms of neatly and effectively meeting a pre-season brief, there’s a strong argument that nobody can match Howe’s achievements this season with Newcastle. Sure, others have more obviously obliterated pre-season targets in thoroughly dramatic fashion, but we’re not sure anyone has taken the two obvious top objectives for a team this season and delivered in the manner of Newcastle.",
      "Back in the Champions League and ending English football’s most ridiculous trophy drought is special, special stuff. Sure, the wider media reaction to Newcastle winning the Carabao might have been too saccharine for most tastes, at times giving the impression that Newcastle had invented winning a trophy after not doing so for ages, at others journalists who have apparently never met a single real-life actual football fan expressing bafflement that all supporters of all clubs weren’t all overjoyed and thrilled about it.",
      "This generally took the form of ‘you just don’t understand what it means’ when the truth was ‘we all understand exactly what it means, we just don’t care as much as Newcastle fans do about it’. This really should be straightforward. Should, say, Tottenham win the Europa League there will be no equivalent media outpouring, no suggestion that if you aren’t as thrilled as Tottenham fans about it all that you simply don’t understand.",
      "So, to be clear: nobody is unclear about the scale and significance of that achievement for Eddie Howe and his team. Not least because even the standard ‘only a Carabao’ barbs struggle to land even more when you consider Newcastle’s run to that trophy.",
      "They took down four of the current top seven en route to glory, thoroughly outclassing Arsenal over two legs in the semi-final and then schooling Liverpool in the final.",
      "One can argue that those clubs had larger primary targets but neither was exactly phoning it in by that stage of the tournament either. And Newcastle beat them up.",
      "The final in particular was a spectacular performance and a huge personal triumph for Howe, who set his team up perfectly to nullify Liverpool’s huge threat at one end without ever curtailing their own attacking capabilities.",
      "The players delivered wonderfully, but this did feel like the manager’s success every bit as much. And for a manager with obvious talent but so little experience of such major finals, that was doubly impressive.",
      "Throw in the now very likely success of goal two – getting back in the Champions League – and you’ve got a manager who in any normal season would be a worthy favourite for manager of the year but in this one finds himself scrapping just to stay on the podium.",
      "",
      "2) Nuno Espirito Santo, Nottingham Forest (1)\nThere’s a risk that they might be running out of steam at just the wrong time, that a seemingly rock-solid grip on Champions League football might be lost on the run-in.",
      "Forest have won only twice since March in a run that has seen them slip to sixth in the league and go out of the FA Cup at the semi-final stage.",
      "And those two wins have been against Manchester United and Tottenham, and at this stage those barely count.",
      "But while we remain keen advocates of the idea that goals change across a season and relative failure can and should often still just be considered failure given the scale of the opportunity being passed up, sometimes you do have to step back and accept that ‘Nottingham Forest only finishing sixth’ would have been a simply batshit sentence to utter in August.",
      "And even more so when Nuno, his reputation in this country in tatters after The Tottenham Unpleasantness, took over a club mired in points deductions and facing relegation.",
      "Two wins at the back end of last season, against the even more stricken Sheffield United and Burnley, were enough to keep Forest up and they have taken that and run with it in remarkable fashion.",
      "Sure, there’s no doubt they’ve been assisted by an unusually high number of big clubs having absolute daftnesses, but they’ve still been hugely impressive.",
      "Forest are not a complicated team to understand, but that’s praiseworthy in itself. They know what they are, what their strengths are and how to get the absolute most out of that more often than not.",
      "Smart recruitment and canny coaching has produced a team more than the sum of its parts, and that’s really all anyone can reasonably ask any manager to produce in what is still less only a season and a half in charge.",
      "",
      "1) Arne Slot, Liverpool (2)\nIt’s very unfair but also true: it has ultimately proved quite hard not to end up using the sheer ease with which Slot has cracked the Premier League puzzle at the first attempt as a counter-intuitive caveat against his achievements this season.",
      "If anything, Clive, he’s almost won his first Premier League title too well.",
      "We’re guilty of it. We still don’t see Slot becoming the next great legacy manager, the next man to put together an era of dominance containing a string of league title a la Ferguson or Guardiola.",
      "We still can’t entirely shake the notion that this has all in some way been a last hurrah for Jurgen Klopp and his team rather than the start of something magical.",
      "And there’s every chance that is going to be made to look like utter foolishness.",
      "Nevertheless, a big part of why Slot’s impact and success might not be quite as hailed as it ought to be is that it’s been so obviously coming for so long that the failure to add any burnishing additional silverware feels vaguely disappointing because human brains are daft things that operate daftly.",
      "What he’s achieved has been staggering, and the easiest and fairest way to measure that is not to simply look just how far clear Liverpool have ended the season – because that really can end up working against them – but where everyone had them finishing when the season began.",
      "They fell away from the title race just as it really got going last season, and few were backing them to match even that under a new manager working largely with the squad he inherited.",
      "It’s been repeatedly and correctly pointed out that Klopp left a very decent squad – albeit one with a few huge contractual roadblocks in the very near distance – but still nobody outside stopped-clock ‘our year’ Liverpool fans really saw this coming.",
      "Just the simple fact the machinations around the Contract Three have never had any dread impact on the field is impressive. And, yes, getting Virgil van Dijk and Mo Salah to be really good is a little bit ‘I told him to do that’ but there have been plenty of new managers before who have come into a settled and successful dressing room and not achieved the level of buy-in from those players to new methods and new ways of doing things.",
      "Still, though, it remains the remodelled midfield that stands as Slot’s greatest achievement. He has elevated Alexis Mac Allister, Ryan Gravenberch and Dominik Szoboszlai to new levels. Each of them had obvious class before this season, but none had shown such a high level for such a sustained period in this league.",
      "It’s not hard to picture plenty of other higher profile managers coming in and finding those the available resources and spending six months whinging about it.",
      "Slot was having none of that, and really has felt like the absolutely ideal kind of coach to come in and take what was already there and provide the small tweaks here and adjustments there to make something even better.",
      "He has, in short, proved the ideal man to finish a necessary rebuild about which Klopp correctly deduced two things. One, that it had to happen but two, that he himself no longer retained the requisite energy to deliver it.",
      "Saying farewell to Klopp was hard, but he knew precisely what he was doing and Liverpool have already reaped the benefits of that.",
      "",
      "The same mistakes have cost Arsenal and Mikel Arteta once again, and fans are losing patience after a fifth successive year without a trophy.",
      "Arsenal have not shown the sort of ruthlessness needed to cross the finish line. It doesn’t even need to be Mikel Arteta who moves on either.",
      "Carragher claims Arteta currently sounds more like a ‘social media fan’ than Arsenal manager after his recent complaints about Liverpool and PSG.",
      "There is a ‘lack of manliness’ at Arsenal which could cost Mikel Arteta his job by the end of the year. That ‘headless chicken’ Declan Rice needs to do more.",
      "There are three Italians at the top of the betting to be the next Arsenal manager after Mikel Arteta. It’s an intriguing list.",
      "Did Arsenal make a ‘sack decision’ on Mikel Arteta within an hour of the final whistle in Paris? It seems unlikely."

This 'get out jail free' card on offer from UEFA in the form of Champions League qualification through winning the Europa League might not be in the best long-term interests of these two underachieving football clubs.",
      "Think about it. Are Spurs and Manchester United truly capable of managing a Premier League campaign alongside playing in the Champions League next season?",
      "Even Man Utd boss Ruben Amorim has issued such a warning, saying: \"We are not ready to play Premier League competitively and be in the Champions League.\"",
      "England will indeed have six spots in the Champions League next year, with one of United and Spurs guaranteed to qualify through winning the Europa League.",

      "United have set a record low points tally for a Premier League season in being able to only reach a maximum of 48 points - their previous lowest was 58. Spurs have lost 19 Premier League games - the most after 34 league games in the club's history.",

      "In an ideal world, without PSR restraints and the lure of playing European football being a necessity for most players, both clubs could just do with a season of Premier League focus.",
      "Just look what it did for Chelsea in 2016/17.",
      "After a season in the doldrums, finishing 10th in the Premier League, Antonio Conte revitalised the club and, without the added stresses of European football, roared them to a Premier League title.",
      "He is on the cusp of repeating the trick with Napoli this season, taking a team that finished 10th and therefore without European football to a Serie A title with a rampaging end-of-season run, whilst chief rivals Inter Milan have been ultimately distracted by their path to the Champions League final.",
      "Inter have shown how going deep in a European campaign can hurt domestic form and it happens regularly on these shores too.",
      "West Ham finished seventh in 2021/22 and won the Conference League. The next season, they finished 14th.",
      "Newcastle finished fourth in 2022/23 and enjoyed a Champions League campaign but then dropped to seventh.",
      "Brighton finished sixth, went on a Europa League adventure and then dropped to 11th as it all unravelled for Roberto De Zerbi.",
      "Since 2004, 25 of 35 teams who qualify for Europe that didn't the season before all won fewer points in the next season as the bright lights of those exciting midweek nights made it difficult to keep concentrated on domestic matters.",
      "Although Spurs and Manchester United don't officially fall into that category, it gives a relevant overview of how a European campaign can make it very hard to remain consistent in the Premier League.",
      "Look at Aston Villa.",
      "They fully embraced the Champions League challenge and produced some memorable nights - beating Bayern Munich at Villa Park - that ultimately led to a quarter-final place, before giving Paris Saint-Germain a serious fright in that last-eight tie, where they were only eliminated by one goal.",
      "But this did come at a cost to their league form, where their results after a Champions League night became affected.",
      "In 11 matches after a European night, Villa won just four of their 11 Premier League games. That's in stark contrast to their form of late, where the rest between games has increased. Since the completion of the league phase of the Champions League, Villa have only lost once in the Premier League from 12 games.",
      "Losing in Bilbao will hurt either team - but that short-term pain might be in the best interests of the club for some long-term gain.",
      "Could those losers actually be the real winners?"

      "Report as two goals from Mason Mount saw Man Utd come from a goal down on the night to beat Athletic Club 4-1 at Old Trafford in the second leg of their Europa League semi-final at Old Trafford; United will play Tottenham in Bilbao",
      "Friday 9 May 2025 06:09, UK",
      "Manchester United are into the final of the Europa League final as a 4-1 win over Athletic Club completed a 7-1 aggregate victory.",
      "Mikel Jaureguizar's first-half goal had given Athletic hope but Mason Mount came off the bench to settle United nerves before goals from Casemiro, Rasmus Hojlund and a second from over 40 yards out by Mount earned a handsome win at Old Trafford.",
      "The result sets up an all-English final in Bilbao on May 21 following Tottenham's win over Bodo/Glimt in the other semi-final. A difficult season for both Premier League clubs will end with one of them securing a Champions League spot next season.",
      "Man Utd: Onana (5), Lindelof (5), Maguire (5), Yoro (6), Mazraoui (6), Casemiro (8), Ugarte (5), Dorgu (5), Garnacho (5), Fernandes (7), Hojlund (6).\n\n\nSubs: Mount (9), Shaw (7), Amad (8), Amass (n/a), Mainoo (n/a).\n\n\nAthletic Club: Agirrezabala (5), Gorosabel (6), Yeray Alvarez (6), Unai Nunez (6), Berechiche (6), Ruiz De Galarreta (6), Jaureguizar (7), Alvaro Djalo (6), Gomez (7), Berenguer (7), Sannadi (6).\n\n\nSubs:De Marcos (5), Prados (n/a), Olabarrieta (5), Guruzeta (5), Vesga Arruti (n/a).\n\n\nPlayer of the match: Mason Mount.",
      "Much of the work had been done in Bilbao, United securing that seemingly unassailable three-goal lead. With the Williams brothers - Nico and Inaki - both unavailable for this return match in Manchester, the feeling was that Athletic lacked the requisite firepower.",
      "But this is United. While they found plenty of space in behind from the outset, they were wasteful. Patrick Dorgu and Alejandro Garnacho were the chief culprits and the Basque side punished them when Mikel Jaureguizar curled in from long range to pull one back.",
      "Harry Maguire lost possession too easily, while Andre Onana got hands to the shot but could not keep it out. It encouraged the vocal away fans to believe that an improbable comeback was on and Garnacho missing a one-on-one did nothing to dispel the notion.",
      "Athletic were dreaming well into the second half but Ruben Amorim's substitutions changed the game. Amad Diallo provided attacking impetus but it was Mount's quality finish that ended Ernesto Valverde's side's hopes, turning and firing expertly into the far corner.",
      "Casemiro's looping header turned it around on the night before another brilliant Amad run laid a goal on a plate for Hojlund. Mount had the final say, finishing beautifully from distance with his weaker left foot after a poor clearance by the Athletic goalkeeper.",
      "It capped a special night at Old Trafford, yet another one for them in this competition. Even in these troubled times for United, the trophies have kept coming. Last season, it was the FA Cup. Now, they are just one game away from European silverware in Bilbao.",
      "Ruben Amorim named an unchanged side from the first leg with Bruno Fernandes returning after being rested at the weekend. Amad Diallo was among the substitutes.",
      "Mount had never scored for United at Old Trafford before this game, his only previous goals for the club coming at Brentford. These two were special, the first because of its importance in the moment and the second enough to light up any evening.",
      "\"We knew it was going to be difficult at the beginning of the game. Getting that goal to make it 1-1 calmed us down. It's been too long [since I had a feeling like this]. I just tried to come on and affect the game.",
      "\"The crowd has been unbelievable. For me personally, my first goals at Old Trafford. Special night, one I have been waiting a long time for. We want to go to Bilbao and finish strong now.\"",
      "Man Utd striker Rasmus Hojlund speaking about his team-mate:",
      "\"I am very pleased for Mason Mount, he is one of my very good friends in this team. He is a good lad, always working very hard.",
      "\"He has been getting a lot of stick because he had a lot of injuries, but he has been positive and trying to get fit all the time.",
      "\"He has only had one goal, that was to get back on the pitch. He did what he did today, we knew he had the quality. It was just about the time.\"",
      "\"Mason Mount, I am so happy for him, he is such a player. He works really hard. He has quality. I really like Kobbie Mainoo, just 10 minutes on the pitch, but everything he did was really good.",
      "\"Sometimes you are on the bench, but you change the game.",
      "\"It is hard to describe what it is like to be a manager in this kind of club. You want to give something to the fans, because we've been so disappointing in the Premier League this season.",
      "\"It is more important to give something to the fans, than to add something [to my CV] as a winner.\"",
      "Asked in the press conference about that final against Tottenham, Amorim said:",
      "\"The position of the coaches is quite similar. The context is different, but we are struggling, both of us. So I don't know what is going to happen. That is the good thing and the bad thing with this team, I never know.\"",
      "\"Games last 90 minutes,\" said Athletic coach Valverde. \"You have to be on it for 90 minutes, especially against teams that won't let you off. It was a wide scoreline.",
      "\"We felt like we had a chance when it was 1-0, it was good to get ahead. They scored a goal at a key time but we were not that bad. It was almost like a walk in the park for them at the end. Take away those last few minutes, it was much more even.\"",
      "Tottenham await Manchester United in the Europa League final.",
      "It takes place at the San Mames Stadium in Bilbao, Spain on Wednesday May 21; kick-off 8pm."

      "Our betting expert Jones Knows unleashes his insight and angles across the Premier League and thinks Aston Villa are a cracking bet to beat Bournemouth.",
      "Fulham have had a strange season.",
      "Marco Silva has got the maximum out of this squad but they've left so many points on the table against the lesser teams in the Premier League. They've won just four of their 13 games against teams in the bottom seven, which makes them easy to swerve here at 11/10 with Sky Bet.",
      "When it comes to the reliability factor, Everton aren't great shakes either, racking up a Premier League high of 15 draws this season. The record for draws in a 38-game season is 17 and they may take one step closer to that in this one.",
      "No Premier League team has won more away points (19) or scored more away goals (18) than Brentford in 2025.",
      "Thomas Frank's side are brimming with confidence and cohesion, and have only lost on one of their last nine Premier League away days.",
      "This is an obvious opportunity for them to stretch that run further and keep up hope of an eighth-place finish, which would be enough for a Conference League spot if Manchester City win the FA Cup. Can they be trusted at such short odds at 4/6 with Sky Bet?",
      "I'd rather play a bigger price and just back Yoane Wissa and Bryan Mbeumo both to record a goal or an assist, where you can get 11/8 with Sky Bet. If you calculate their goal involvements this season then Mbeumo and Wissa have 45 between them. A phenomenal record.",
      "If Southampton can only generate 0.5 worth of expected goals and allow Leicester to beat them to nil then what chance have they got facing a footballing machine like City? Saints remain the lowest scorers in the English leagues with just 25 goals, and City's defence has developed a snarl in recent weeks. It's much more secure, with the Ruben Dias and Josko Gvardiol axis impressing.",
      "Man City to win to nil is 11/10 with Sky Bet.",
      "The player-to-be-fouled market offered by Sky Bet is quickly becoming one of my favourite markets. There is lots of value to be had there if you can find the right match-up or latch onto a developing fouls trend in the market that has gone unnoticed by the traders.",
      "The player on my radar here is Brighton centre-back Jan Paul van Hecke. He's been fouled 15 times in his last nine starts and has been fouled in every single one of those games.",
      "So those backing him to be fouled one or more times in the last nine games have landed nine winners - a 100 per cent strike rate. His fouls lines are extra juicy here based on his direct opponent in Jorgen Strand Larsen, as the centre forward is a big fouls-committed merchant, making 19 in his last eight games.",
      "Van Hecke is 13/8 with Sky Bet to be fouled two or more times.",
      "Bournemouth have won just one of their last six Premier League home games and the underlying numbers have followed suit in terms of decline. Over the first nine home games this season, their expected-goals data was working at 1.96 per 90, but over the last six, it's down to 1.29. Meanwhile, their expected-goals-against data has taken a whack too. That's gone from 0.9 per 90 to 1.68 per 90 in the last six home games.",
      "The blueprint to stop Bournemouth is something Unai Emery has been implementing against Andoni raola before Iraola-ball was even a thing in the UK - since the Villa boss was manager of Villarreal, in fact. He knows exactly how Bournemouth are going to set up and he's going to implement his plan to stop them - like he has done in every meeting with Iraola before.",
      "Emery has won three and drawn two of the five meetings between the pair. He can lead Villa to an important win at 17/10 with Sky Bet.",
      "Lots being on the line, added to two teams who know how to mix it, means this should be a full-blooded affair. They've already played one another twice this season and there's been 15 cards shown in total, so there is spice potential.",
      "Enzo Fernandez's price stands out on picking up a booking based on his likely match-up with Bruno Guimaraes in central areas. It's Brazil vs Argentina in there and Bruno is a foul-drawing master, having been responsible for getting 34 players booked since the start of last season. A huge figure.",
      "Fernandez's cards data away from home recently is very appealing too - he's been carded in six of his last nine away games.",
      "Nottingham Forest are ridiculously short in the betting here at 1/3 with Sky Bet, even against a team like Leicester, when you factor in what is on the line and the expectation on the home side to win the game. It's something they've not coped with at home, losing to both Everton and Brentford in front of a very nervy crowd.",
      "So at the prices, Forest have to be taken on here, but I want to chase a bigger price in Jamie Vardy to score and be carded at 18/1 with Sky Bet.",
      "Vardy will be relishing this occasion.",
      "He needs just one goal to reach 200 for Leicester and you can see him doing it at the City Ground, with perhaps a prepared shirt underneath celebrating the milestone.",
      "He's in the shop window too, isn't he? Strikers don't come more motivated when trying to play for a next contract so he's going to be doing his upmost to grab the limelight.",
      "\"Who cares if we've struggled in the league?\" beamed Ange Postecoglou after going to the Arctic Circle and getting the job done in impressive fashion on Thursday night. Judging by his words, it will be another rest and rotate job for this one in what could be a very low-key game up against another team with a huge fixture on the horizon.",
      "Oliver Glasner seems a little more convinced about keeping the rhythm of his team together in the build-up to that Wembley final and it's easy to see why the market favours them here at 29/20 with Sky Bet.",
      "The one constant this season in a bang average West Ham side has been Jarrod Bowen's attacking output.",
      "He will have been disappointed not to have kicked on in terms of improving last year's numbers but a per-90 average of 0.59 goal involvements is still something to be proud of playing for a team who could finish 17th in the Premier League. Bowen has four goal involvements in his last three games and is 11/8 with Sky Bet to grab another.",
      "Arsenal have scored 17 goals fewer and recorded 20.7 expected goals fewer than Liverpool in the Premier League this season. That has held them back and has proven costly across all their major trophy hunts this season. Just look at that first 10 minutes at PSG.",
      "They were sensational in every department, apart from the most important one - putting the ball in the net.",
      "One player that may start doing that more next season is Declan Rice, who remains very attractive in the goalscorer markets based on his new position playing in the No 8 role. In his 54 starts in that position, he's managed to score 12 goals. Those numbers make the 20/1 first goalscorer price with Sky Bet look a little wild.",

      "United forward Alejandro Garnacho, who was seated next to him in the press conference, was then asked for his opinion on the comments made by his manager and how it impacts the dressing room.",
      "He said: \"We know we are not doing a great job in the Premier League. We follow the rules and tomorrow we will face the game like it is 0-0.",
      "\"If we win the Europa League, we will be in the Champions League and we can face the next season with a better mentality.\"",
      "Amorim also went on to speak about the fitness of his squad for the fixture, where he ruled out defender Matthijs de Ligt after he was forced off during the 4-3 defeat to Brentford.",
      "\"It is not a big issue,\" Amorim continued. \"He cannot play then we will check day by day. The rest, Ayden [Heaven] doesn't recover. Toby [Collyer] is not available.",

      "Man Utd boss Amorim revealed in March he had told the 30-year-old he was \"not going anywhere\" following links to Real Madrid, with Amorim striking a similar tone amid talk of a summer move to Saudi Arabia.",
      "\"I think it is easy to understand (his importance) - not just because of the numbers but the way he plays, the importance that he has during his five years here,\" Amorim said.",
      "\"He is a top player, we need top players. He is a leader, he's the captain, so he's really important.",
      "\"It's normal that a lot of clubs want a player like Bruno, like (Alejandro) Garnacho, like others.",
      "\"But we want to keep the best players and Bruno is clearly one of the top players in the world, so our idea didn't change. We want Bruno here.\""
