      "Mason Greenwood and Tyrone Mings angrily clashed in their pre-season meeting, with the ex-Manchester United man being grabbed by the neck. Greenwood’s current side Marseille took on Aston Villa in a friendly on Saturday evening.",
      "But it ended up being an ill-tempered affair between the two sides. New signing Evann Guessand, Matty Cash, John McGinn, and Donyell Malen were all booked throughout the clash.",
      "Tensions then boiled over late on between Greenwood and a couple of Villa stars. The striker kicked out at Belgian midfielder Andre Onana after evading a number of challenges.",
      "That did not go down well with the former Everton man, who berated Greenwood, who then laughed in his face. Onana then pointed to his face as though the forward has spat at him, but it was unclear on whether he had actually done so.",
      "Defender Mings then got involved as he grappled with Greenwood and grabbed the striker by the scruff of his neck. Numerous players then piled in as the scenes turned ugly.",
      "Tempers soon calmed but Greenwood was left with a ripped shirt and was shortly taken off of the pitch by Roberto De Zerbi - who was spotted arguing with Unai Emery on the sidelines.",
      "Villa eventually fell to a 3-1 defeat to Marseille. Greenwood had scored in the first half, while Villa captain John McGinn also found the net.",
      "But two strikes from returning forward Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang secured victory for the French side. Villa round off their preparations for the new campaign on Sunday as they travel to Spain to take on Villarreal.",
      "How will Aston Villa do in the Premier League this season? Share your predictions in the comments below",
      "Emery’s side commence their Premier League campaign against Newcastle in the Midlands in a week’s time. Meanwhile, Marseille are back in action on Friday evening as they take on Rennes in their first Ligue 1 game of the season.",
      "Greenwood will be hoping to extend the hot form that he displayed last season. The former United forward struck 22 goals in all competitions last term.",
      "He has been at the heart of considerable transfer interest this summer. Barcelona have regularly been linked with him, while he also reportedly has admirers in Saudi Arabia.",
      "Greenwood has also made a major change when it comes to his international allegiances. Having previously earned one England cap, he is now set to represent Jamaica having been granted citizenship.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Failure to pay players and staff saw the club put under a transfer embargo. That has since been lifted, albeit Wednesday are still not able to pay fees for any incoming transfers until the summer of 2027.",
      "It has led the Yorkshire side to a disastrous situation where loans and free transfers are their only ports of call to bolster their side. But it appears that two of United’s most promising youngsters could be drafted in.",
      "According to The Star, Wednesday are interested in signing both Harry Amass and Toby Collyer on loan for the following campaign. Both youngsters are available, with Collyer himself having expressed his desire for more first-team football.",
      "Speaking earlier this summer, the midfielder said: \"I'll sit down with the manager and higher-ups and see what the best solution is for that, the best way for me to develop, whether it's stay here or go on loan.",

      "“But in the background Kevin (Beadell, head of recruitment), the coaches and his staff are spending a lot of time to prepare for the window.”",
      "He added: “Of course it is hard with the embargo, but we try to find all the players under this amount of money who can help Sheffield Wednesday. Of course it is a challenge to find a player who can perform now, who can be good enough in three months, who can help us in February, March, April, May. We need to have some patience. We have to hurry-up, but with a sense of patience.”",

      "David de Gea insists he does not hold a grudge with Manchester United over the manner in which he left the club back in the summer of 2023.",
      "The veteran goalkeeper, 34, spent 12 years at Old Trafford and was in talks to extend his stay further before Erik ten Hag, the club's former manager, decided he wanted to sign a new keeper. De Gea was subsequently released with the club declining to take up a one year option in the Spaniard's contract.",
      "The decision to part ways with De Gea - plus the way it was handled - massively divided opinion at the time.",
      "But De Gea, who played at Old Trafford in a pre-season friendly for his new club, Fiorentina, on Saturday, said there is no bad blood with United when he was asked if he was disappointed over the circumstances of his exit.",
      "\"No. Sometimes football is like it is, you can't control everything,\" he replied.",
      "\"I've been here [Manchester United] 12 years, very, very nice, it's one of the best periods of my life. Playing for this club is just unbelievable, especially when you leave the club, you realise how big is the club, how difficult it was to be 12 years in a club like United. I'm always grateful for this club, for everyone, it's been an amazing journey.",
      "\"It's been a long time since I've been back here so it's been a special day, of course.\"",
      "After making the decision to move in a different direction in the goalkeeping department, Manchester United signed Andre Onana from Inter Milan in a deal worth £47.2million.",
      "Onana arrived with a reputation as one of Europe's top keepers but has struggled to replicate his impressive form in the Premier League, making a catalogue of high-profile errors. That in turn has led to speculation that United could move to sign a new goalkeeper this summer and several names have been linked with the Red Devils, who finished 15th last season.",
      "While it remains to be seen if Onana will retain his spot as United's No 1, De Gea is tipping Ruben Amorim to get his former club back to where they should be in the league.",
      "\"Sometimes this is football, you can't win all the time,\" De Gea said. \"I know it's been some years that United struggle a bit but it's one of the best clubs in the world, it's a massive club and hopefully this year with the new signings and the manager starting a new era they can do something big and that's it.",
      "\"Hopefully this year they can win something and be there where they deserve.\"",

      "Ruben Amorim hailed Mason Mount's performance as 'unbelievable' and is anticipating a number of selection headaches heading into Manchester United's first Premier League match of the season. The Red Devils welcome Arsenal to Old Trafford when they kick off their campaign next Sunday.",
      "United wrapped up their pre-season preparations with an underwhelming draw against Fiorentina. Amorim's men were forced to come from behind after some dreadful defending at a corner, and only recorded a draw thanks to an own goal.",
      "Nevertheless, United's new-look frontline, short of Benjamin Sesko who was presented to fans ahead of the game, showed glimpses of promise. Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo did not get on the scoresheet but will have lofty expectations having come in with a proven Premier League record.",
      "It was Mount that drew praise from Amorim on Saturday afternoon for his role in the frontline however. The ex-Chelsea star proved his versatility and persistence and could be set to start the season, with Sesko only having a week to get up to speed in time for Arsenal.",
      "Amorim said: \"It’s unbelievable. The way he works is unbelievable.",

      "\"That is a good thing and it’s supposed to be like that,\" he said. \"This is the normal thing.",

      "Manchester United supporters have begged the club to sign a holding midfielder after watching Casemiro toil in the final friendly of pre-season. United were held to a 1-1 draw by Fiorentina at Old Trafford on Saturday afternoon, underlining that they still have a long way to go under Ruben Amorim.",
      "United found themselves 1-0 down after just eight minutes as Simon Sohm was left completely unmarked from a corner to put Fiorentina ahead. The hosts levelled shortly after with an own goal from Robin Gosens from a set piece of their own but couldn’t find a winner.",
      "Amorim fielded Casemiro alongside captain Bruno Fernandes in central midfield, with Mason Mount playing as a false No.9 up front with new signings Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha. Benjamin Sesko was introduced to the crowd before kick-off after completing his £74million move from RB Leipzig and fans called out for another transfer during the game.",
      "Casemiro is now 33 years old and has been with United for three years following a move from Real Madrid. He has been linked with a switch to Saudi Arabia, but that hasn’t materialised and some fans are frustrated by his performances.",
      "“Casemiro does everything in slow mo,” one wrote on X. “Casemiro’s knees have gone for real, he’s a masters player now,” another added. A third wrote: “Casemiro is finished. So slow. Desperately need a midfielder.”",
      "It is clear who the fans have in mind: Carlos Baleba. The Brighton star has been linked with a move to United, but the Seagulls value him at over £100m, making a deal very difficult to do. Nevertheless, Casemiro’s performance against Fiorentina has some convinced that Baleba is worth it.",
      "“Casemiro's legs are gone. Ugarte is error prone. United desperately need a DM,” one fan wrote. “He's only playing Casemiro and Fernandes in midfield so he can demand Baleba is in by Wednesday,” another added. A third joked: “Wise of Amorim to pick Casemiro in midfield to highlight why we need Baleba.”",
      "Manuel Ugarte and Kobbie Mainoo both made appearances off the bench against Fiorentina in the second half, while Toby Collyer was another midfield option in the squad. Meanwhile, it was telling that Rasmus Hojlund was left on the bench, despite no other centre-forward being available.",
      "Hojlund’s place is clearly under threat following the arrival of Sesko, who scored 21 times for Leipzig last season. The Dane struggled last season, netting just 10 times in all competitions, with just four in the league, and could be sold to raise funds for further deals.",
      "United have already splashed over £200m to bring in Sesko, Cunha, Mbeumo and left-back Diego Leon, but still want further additions. A new goalkeeper to challenge Andre Onana and Altar Bayindir is on the cards, as well as a No.6 midfielder. The club has until the end of September to reinforce their squad, which finished 15th last season.",

      "Manchester United could only earn a draw as their pre-season preparations ended in a 1-1 draw against Fiorentina. The Red Devils returned to Old Trafford with their new signings as Ruben Amorim was afforded a final opportunity to test his plans ahead of the new season.",
      "The early stages of the match did not show a team ready to take on Arsenal next week. Some scandalous defending from an eighth minute corner left two bodies completely free and saw Simon Sohm to hit the ball first time past Altay Bayindir.",
      "And while United settled in to dominate position, they're equaliser required a corner of their own and some good fortune. Robin Gosens put the ball into his own net with Casemiro lucky not to be punished after putting some enthusiastic pressure on his opponent.",
      "Flashes of creativity emerged from the home team's frontline of Bryan Mbeumo, Mason Mount and Matheus Cunha but clear-cut opportunities were not always forthcoming against former United goalkeeper David De Gea. Smart play between Mount and Bruno fernandes offered United their best opportunity for Cunha, but the Brazil international saw an effort from eight yards blocked in the closing stages of the game.",
      "After United confirmed the signing of Benjamin Sesko on Saturday morning, it was no surprise to see the 22-year-old in attendance at Old Trafford. The striker was presented to fans alongside Matheus Cunha, Diego Leon and Bryan Mbeumo before kick-off.",
      "It was Sesko who received the loudest cheer as he entered the Theatre of Dreams and soon may have the greatest expectations of finding the net. While Cunha and Mbeumo started against Fiorentina, Sesko is likely the final piece of a new frontline.",
      "\"He's really young. He's good in the air. He's good running the channels. He's good on the ball. So I think he has great potential. I think he can improve a lot,\" said Amorim before kick-off.",
      "\"Ben is a player that, with all the information that we have, we need to stop the guy from working - it is not the opposite! That is also important.\"",
      "Amorim will hope his new front three can soon find the net after not looking too likely to against Italian opposition. The interplay and playmaking from Cunha and Mbeumo gives some reason for optimism however.",
      "Mason Mount's outing suggests he should not be ruled out of the club's starting XI either. The former Chelsea man has plenty of talent to take advantage of and could yet keep his place against Arsenal as Sesko settles in.",
      "The goalkeeper made his return to Manchester having departed in 2023. It was no surprise to see a positive reception as soon as he entered the field to warm up and having greeted United stars in the tunnel, De Gea was also presented with a framed picture ahead of kick-off.",
      "The applause did not stop there as his first pause in possession of the ball saw a lively reception. And the Spaniard showed some of his trademark talent too.",
      "After 30 minutes De Gea rolled back the years to save Leny Yoro's point blank range header to send a reminder to all those in attendance. Few were better as a shotstopper than De Gea during his time at United and he earned an impressive response when replaced in the 87th minute.",
      "The veteran is a rare legend to emerge from a relative fallow period having guarded the net for United's last Premier League title more than a decade ago. It was perhaps time to move on but his quality can certainly be appreciated.",
      "Ahead of the game, Ruben Amorim spoke of the importance in managing the team's minutes to ensure his team are ready for the start of the season. One figure who has been a consistent presence is defender Lenny Yoro however.",
      "Despite his tender age, the French central defender has started four of the five friendlies. Yoro's team-mates in the backline have seen greater rotation with Harry Maguire and Ayden Heaven's requiring time on the pitch to get up to speed.",
      "After injury prevented him making a quick impression 12 months ago, Yoro looks a certain starter next week.",
      "With frontline additions now complete, United's attention could turn to midfield. Players may need to be sold to facilitate a significant move but Amorim will have received a reminder that he still requires more depth.",
      "It wasn't too long before Casemiro established that a midfield combination with Bruno Fernandes is not the ideal make-up for the Portuguese coach. The Brazilian looked a little slow for the intensity awaiting in the Premier League and when he lost the ball on the edge of the box it was clear United fans were not convinced.",
      "Perhaps Rasmus Hojlund could be a player to help free up some cash. The Dane wanted to remain at Old Trafford but a potential move to AC Milan could be gathering pace.",
      "A loan with an option to sign Hojlund looks to be on the table, though the foorward is said to be reluctant to make a temporary move. Playing time was not high on the agend for the attacker however and he did not make it on to the pitch having being named among the substitutes.",
      "Manchester United's transfer business and pre-season performances have perhaps offered some enthusiasm for the new Premier League campaign. Amorim has already suggested he can see a difference in his side.",
      "“I can feel the improvements in the environment now that the right details are in place to help us all to be better,\" he wrote in his programme notes. \"The players we worked with last season are looking stronger, and we have made some important additions to the squad.\"",
      "Leaving two players free from a corner to go behind at home was not a sign that all the details were complete however. There were flashes of creativity and talent in United's forward play but to suggest it was always convincing would be a stretch.",
      "Fiorentina certainly are not Arsenal but the Gunners may leave more room. There are still questions for United to answer before being confident they have fixed last season's issues.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "United have completed a £74m deal for RB Leipzig striker Benjamin Sesko. The 22-year-old is the third forward the club have signed this summer, with Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo helping to revamp the team’s frontline.",
      "Following the trio’s arrival, Baleba has emerged as a target for United and there had been speculation that midfielder Collyer could be used to help the club reach Brighton’s valuation. However, United are keen to keep Collyer on their books, which will please club captain Bruno Fernandes.",
      "The 21-year-old impressed Fernandes during his European debut against Rangers in January. Collyer was picked to start ahead of Manuel Ugarte, Kobbie Mainoo and Casemiro, and the United skipper highlighted his performance.",
      "\"He trains very well every week, trains at the maximum level,\" Fernandes told MUTV. \"He's a really good kid who wants to learn. “He's eager to learn and listen and he has big, big qualities. He's aggressive off the ball, he's aggressive running with the ball, he's class in tight spaces, and he is just going to get better.\"",
      "Fernandes was not the only club icon to praise Collyer’s contributions in a United shirt. Rio Ferdinand was on commentary during United’s 2-1 win over Rangers and appreciated the midfielder’s work.",
      "Ferdinand had previously spoken positively about Collyer’s efforts in the club’s FA Cup victory over Arsenal. “Toby Collyer was excellent when he came on, the energy levels were huge, through the roof. Testament to him,” Ferdinand said on his YouTube Channel.",
      "A few days later, Collyer once again impressed Ferdinand from the bench in a win over Southampton. “I really like him, I think he's got great energy, he's done that a few times off the bench,” the pundit said on Rio Ferdinand Presents. “Gives us that extra pair of legs to get amongst it. looks confident, wants to take the ball.\"",
      "Collyer, who joined United from Brighton’s academy in 2022, was determined to impress Amorim during the club’s tour of the USA. However, the 21-year-old admitted he may have to head out on loan in search of more game time.",
      "“I think first and foremost I want to be here and play as many games for Man United as possible,\" Collyer told reporters. \"I'll sit down with the manager and higher-ups and see what's the best solution for that. The best way for me to develop, whether it's stay here or go on loan. The end goal for me is to play as many minutes as possible here, hopefully starting every week.

      "Manchester United have signed Benjamin Sesko because he has all the attributes they crave – but Ruben Amorim thinks they might have to rein one of them in.",
      "United have signed Sesko from RB Leipzig for a fee of £66.4m plus a further £7.6m in potential add-ons. The 22-year-old striker has signed a five-year contract with United and will line up alongside fellow new arrivals Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo this season.",
      "Sesko chose United over Newcastle, who also had a bid accepted by Leipzig, and could make his debut when Amorim’s side begin their Premier League campaign against Arsenal next weekend. He was unveiled at Old Trafford before United’s final pre-season friendly against Fiorentina on Saturday, with Amorim explaining what attracted him to the Slovenia international.",
      "“He has the characteristics that we needed,” Amorim told MUTV. “Ben is a player that, with all the information that we have, we need to stop the guy from working – it is not the opposite! That is also important.",
      "“He is really young, he is good in the air, he is good at running the channels and he is good on the ball, so I think he has great potential. I think he can improve a lot.",
      "“For sure, he is going to feel at home in our club. He is the right character in this group so we are really, really happy to have him.”",
      "United recently returned from their pre-season tour of the United States and have a new £236m training complex to enjoy at Carrington. After a miserable 2024/25 campaign, in which they finished 15th in the league and lost the Europa League final, Amorim believes Sesko is walking into a better environment.",
      "He added: \"That is important, and he is going to notice on the first day, in the first training [session] that he is in the right place. He is going to the new building and that is also important. Things are getting better, but in the end, we need to win games, and we will try to start today.”",
      "Sesko could have played in the Champions League if he’d joined Newcastle, but snubbed them for United. “The history of Manchester United is obviously very special but what really excites me is the future,\" he said. “When we discussed the project, it was clear that everything is in place for this team to continue to grow and compete for the biggest trophies again soon.",
      "“From the moment that I arrived, I could feel the positive energy and family environment that the club has created. It is clearly the perfect place to reach my maximum level and fulfil all of my ambitions.",

      "Manchester United are pushing to secure a sensational £100million deal for Brighton midfielder Carlos Baleba. With his new-look £200m front three now in place, manager Ruben Amorim now wants a steely midfielder to shore things up in the centre of the park and protect the back line - and Baleba is top of the club's shortlist.",
      "The Cameroon international has been quietly, but consistently, turning heads since stepping into Moises Caicedo's sizable shoes following the Ecuadorian's mega-money move to Chelsea in 2023. As a result, Brighton have no intention of selling him amid reports it will take a nine-figure sum to simply bring them to the negotiating table.",
      "United know prising Baleba from Brighton will be no easy task, but have nonetheless opened talks with the Seagulls to test their resolve. Meeting the asking price would make the 21-year-old the most expensive signing in the club's history - and mark one of the costliest deals the sport has ever seen.",
      "But it won't be all sunshine and rainbows after that. In fact, Baleba will have to be on his best behaviour, with four strict rules - implemented by Amorim - to adhere to. The Portuguese boss has introduced these measures to raise standards at Old Trafford after a disappointing first season at the helm - one plagued by poor form and ill-discipline. Here's what the young midfielder would face:",
      "Players are prohibited from treating international breaks as vacation time. This rule came after incidents like Marcus Rashford and Casemiro jetting off to the US for leisure when not selected for national duty.",
      "Amorim emphasised setting club standards for rest, such as limiting travel or days off. \"We as a club have to set the standards and manage that,\" he said of the changes.",
      "\"It's my decision if they can have five days, or three days, or three days to rest and you cannot fly. This is something that us as a club have to decide. So this must be started in the club, with us and me being responsible in that area.\"",
      "To prioritise physical fitness, Amorim has outlawed food in the dressing room on matchdays. This is part of his broader push to maintain elite conditioning and uphold higher professional standards within the squad.",
      "News of the ban came after Amorim spoke of the importance of his team being in peak physical condition to \"run like mad dogs\" and compete with the very best in the Premier League.",
      "\"You can do a starting line-up with the best players on the planet, without running they also won't win,\" he said in December last year. \"We have to run like mad dogs, if not we won't win.\"",
      "In a bid to foster accountability and competition, the losing side in training sessions is now required to collect all the equipment used that day. This rule is designed to instil discipline and motivation ahead of the 2025/26 campaign.",
      "Speaking about the new rule, United youngster Toby Collyer told The Athletic: \"Everyone wants to be the team that wins. You don't have to get the gear in then. It's a jeopardy if you lose! All the other teams have to get the gear in.\"",
      "Diogo Dalot noted that pre-season standards have risen compared to last year, hinting earlier this month that the new rule may be achieving its intended impact. \"If you want to be in Manchester United, you need to match some standards. If you can't match them, it's not a place for you. The message is really clear,\" the Portugal defender said.",
      "One of Amorim's first major changes was banning coaches from delivering overly complicated instructions, insisting everything be simplified before reaching the players. The aim: to streamline communication and sharpen focus.",
      "Despite wanting to instil the same fluid, intricate, high-octane style his Sporting CP side mastered, the 40-year-old is taking a more refined approach to conveying messages. This is designed to ensure players act instinctively on the pitch, without being bogged down by overthinking.",
      "Amorim believes clarity breeds confidence - and that player who understands their roles implicitly will execute them with far greater precision under pressure.",

      "Cunha was the first to be snapped up, though, signing from Wolves at the beginning of June after his £62.5m release clause was activated. However, Cole, who starred in the Premier League for West Ham, Chelsea and Liverpool, believes the 26-year-old's attitude is a major worry.",
      "\"I wouldn't want to say he is a bad lad because I wouldn't want to say that, but he's a bit of a maverick and I've heard people talk about him being a bit of a maverick.",
      "\"The last thing that United dressing room needs is another maverick, there are mavericks everywhere putting stuff on social media and all that. You hear too much coming out of that dressing room so it's a gamble with Cunha.\"",
      "Cunha landed himself in hot water last season, twice being fined and banned by the Football Association for misconduct. The first incident came in December, when he was handed a two-game ban and hit with an £80,000 fine for an altercation against Ipswich Town in the Premier League.",
      "After the full-time whistle, a scuffle broke out between Wolves and the victorious Ipswich players, and Cunha appeared to strike a member of the opposition's coaching team. His suspension was confirmed in January.",
      "Later in March, Cunha was fined another £50k and suspended for an extra fourth game of a three-match ban after he was sent off for clashing with defender Milos Kerkez, now of Liverpool, in extra time of Wolves' FA Cup defeat by Bournemouth.",
      "The Brazilian will be joined at Old Trafford by Slovenian striker Sesko, who, after a tumultuous summer that also saw him linked with a move to Newcastle, was announced as a United player on Saturday.",

      "Paris Saint-Germain anticipate a possible flurry of bids for goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma after already signing his replacement — and the French champions believe Manchester United will be among the clubs queuing up. PSG have agreed a deal for Lille shotstopper Lucas Chevalier, who will join on a five-year contract after the Champions League winners decided to pay up €40million (£34.7m), with the potential for a further €15m (£13) in add-ons, for his services.",
      "Donnarumma has just one year remaining on his contract in Paris and the club are happy to part ways with the understanding they would still have two top goalkeepers at the Parc des Princes. The former AC Milan star is said to have been interested in extending his deal but an agreement was not reached.",
      "Donnarumma had wanted an increase in pay despite being among the team's highest earners. The Italian international is currently on €850,000-a-month (£736,000) and failed to come into line with the club's new salary structure focused on lower salary bases with greater incentives",
      "PSG expect to receive an offer from United, Chelsea or Inter Milan, according to ESPN. The trio of European giants are reported to have been in touch with Donnarumma's agent, Enzo Raiola.",
      "United have been widely linked to signing a goalkeeper in recent months, though not always of the same calibre as Donnarumma. The future of back-up option Altay Bayindir has been uncertain with greater competition for Andre Onana said to be wanted.",
      "Onana's injury in pre-season also added fuel to speculation in combination with his unconvincing United career. The ex-Ajax ace is expected to be fit in time for the start of the Premier League season however.",
      "United have already spent in excess of £200million this summer. The Red Devils ambitions have been on replenishing their forward line thus far in the transfer window.",
      "The arrival of Benjamin Sesko was confirmed by the club on a five-year deal after agreeing a fee worth up to £74m with Bundesliga side RB Leipzig. The Slovenia striker joins Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo in Ruben Amorim's squad.",
      "Any further significant outlay may require the club to make sales however. Jadon Sancho, Tyrell Malacia, Antony and Alejandro Garnacho are all currently outside of first team plans.",
      "United have so far been able to facilitate exits but the latter is the subject of interest from Chelsea. The Argentina winger has already agreed personal terms over a switch to Stamford Bridge but there remains a question of whether Chelsea will meet United’s £50m price-tag.",

      "Benjamin Sesko has made the leap from RB Leipzig to Manchester United in a £74million transfer – and there will be one familiar face at Old Trafford.",
      "Sesko has snubbed a move to Newcastle in favour of joining United, who have paid £66.4m up front plus a further £7.6m in potential add-ons. The 22-year-old striker will slot into Ruben Amorim’s new-look front line, alongside fellow new signings Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo.",
      "United’s press release announcing the capture of Sesko makes it clear how delighted they are to land the Slovenia international in what they view as a coup, given their lack of European football this season.",
      "“The desire that all of our new signings have shown to join the club this summer highlights the appeal and stature of Manchester United,” said director of football Jason Wilcox.",
      "That may well be true, but Wilcox also has one of his colleagues to thank after landing Sesko from under Newcastle’s nose. Christopher Vivell was instrumental in getting the deal over the line, thanks in large part to his connections with Sesko and his agent Elvis Basanovic.",
      "Vivell only joined United last summer, initially as an interim director of recruitment, but by February he had secured the role permanently. Omar Berrada, who joined the club from Manchester City last summer to become chief executive, had pushed for Vivell’s arrival, having got on well with him in their previous roles.",
      "The 38-year-old German left Chelsea under a cloud in July 2023, just seven months after arriving as technical director. But Berrada and United were not fazed and brought him in. They are now seeing the fruits of that decision.",
      "Vivell has a good reputation in Germany, where he began at Hoffenheim before joining the Red Bull Group. That is where he encountered Sesko, signing him for Red Bull Salzburg initially before bringing him to sister club Leipzig in 2023.",
      "Sesko scored 39 goals in 87 games for Leipzig, attracting plenty of Premier League attention, including from Arsenal. And while he cited United’s history and the project laid out by Ruben Amorim as reasons for joining, he also was encouraged by Vivell’s presence, having had only good experiences in his previous two moves involving the German.",
      "Sesko isn’t the only highly rated young striker who Vivell has snapped up in his time, as United well know. Back in 2019, United wanted to sign Erling Haaland from Molde, having been given a recommendation by then-managed Ole Gunnar Solskjaer.",
      "But they did not succeed in chasing the Norwegian superstar, who snubbed a succession of bigger clubs to join Salzburg, having been courted by Vivell. “The big clubs wanted him too,” he later explained. “But they wanted to do a loan programme, which neither his father nor Erling wanted. That’s why we managed to bring him to us.”",
      "Vivell worked with former United manager Ralf Rangnick at Red Bull and also tried to hire Erik ten Hag for Leipzig before he left Ajax for United. Those connections are incidental compared to those with Sesko, which helped land who United hope will be the answer to their goalscoring woes.",

      "Following a loan stint with Norwich City, his prospects at Highbury appeared grim. During the summer of 2005, Bentley handed in a transfer request and secured a permanent switch to Blackburn in January 2006 after a temporary loan spell there.",
      "Despite shining at Blackburn and ultimately securing a £15million transfer to Tottenham in 2008, where his career would falter, he acknowledges he probably should have stuck with the Gunners for longer but simply lacked confidence in Wenger.",

      "\"Because, if you found yourself out the team, you were criticised more than you are now. Now, you're a squad player. Just having a rest, not in the squad today.",
      "\"[I left Arsenal because] I wanted to play. I signed a five-year deal and left after six months! Wenger was like, 'No, do this.' He had a plan, didn't he? But I couldn't see that plan. Didn't trust it.",

      "His contributions helped Blackburn in their UEFA Cup campaign that season, and he was honoured as the club's Player of the Year by fans in 2007 amidst rumours of a move to the Red Devils.",

Bentley's time at Spurs was not fruitful, however, leading to a series of loan spells, including a stint at Russian outfit FC Rostov.",
      "The midfielder also played for Birmingham City and West Ham, and after a brief return to Blackburn in 2013, he was released by Tottenham that June. By the following year, at just 29, Bentley retired from professional football, unable to secure a new club.",

      "Speaking after his transfer was announced, the forward said: \"The history of Manchester United is obviously very special but what really excites me is the future.",
      "“When we discussed the project, it was clear that everything is in place for this team to continue to grow and compete for the biggest trophies again soon.",
      "“From the moment that I arrived, I could feel the positive energy and family environment that the club has created. It is clearly the perfect place to reach my maximum level and fulfil all of my ambitions.",
      "“I cannot wait to start learning from Ruben and connecting with my team-mates to achieve the success that we all know we are capable of together.”",
      "During his two seasons in east Germany, Sesko scored 39 goals while providing eight assists in 87 appearances. He's already earned 41 caps for Slovenia, scoring six goals and representing them at Euro 2024 last summer.",
      "Will Benjamin Sesko be successful at Manchester United? Give us your prediction in the comments section.",
      "Sesko's speed and stature has drawn comparisons to Manchester City striker Erling Haaland, who also played for Salzburg before moving to the Bundesliga. At 6ft 5in, United hope that he'll adapt to the rigours of the Premier League.",
      "Their focus will now turn to midfield. Brighton's Carlos Baleba is understood to be a target after contact was made through intermediaries this week.",
      "The Red Devils also want to sell a host of players, with Chelsea in talks to buy Alejandro Garnacho. Sesko's arrival could also spell the end of United striker Rasmus Hojlund, who's available for around £40m.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more."

      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe has delivered what Cristiano Ronaldo demanded after leaving Manchester United, according to Diogo Dalot. Ronaldo slammed the training facilities at United after leaving the club under a cloud in January 2023 and Ratcliffe has now unveiled changes at Carrington.",
      "United have returned from their pre-season tour of the United States and moved into a new first-team complex at their training ground. The renovations were undertaken during the 2024/25 season and were part of a £236million investment by Ratcliffe and his INEOS ownership group.",
      "The petrochemicals billionaire said United now “stands shoulder to shoulder with Coca-Cola and Apple” as one of the most recognisable brands in the world and needed a training ground to match their ambitions. It comes two and a half years after Ronaldo claimed nothing had changed between when he left for Real Madrid in 2009 and his return in 2021.",
      "\"Nothing changed, surprisingly,\" he said in an explosive interview with Piers Morgan. \"Not only the pool, the jacuzzi, even the gym. Even the kitchen, the chefs, whom I appreciate – lovely people. They stopped in time. It surprised me a lot.",
      "\"I thought I would see other things, technologies and infrastructure. Unfortunately, we see a lot of what I used to see at 21, 22 and 23 years old. It really surprised me. Since [Sir Alex] Ferguson left, I haven't seen an evolution at the club. Progress is zero. You have to tear it down and rebuild it.\"",
      "Asked about Ronaldo’s criticism, his Portugal team-mate Dalot said: \"I'm sure he would love it if he would be able to see it. But overall I think the message was clear that this club deserved even more and all credit to Sir Jim and his team.\"",
      "He added: \"I think finally we're getting to a level where this club deserves and now it's up to us, on the pitch, to also match that standard. If we're talking about a club like Man United, we should have the best facilities in the world. The big thing that I like the most is now there's going to be no excuses.\"",
      "United finished a lowly 15th in the Premier League last season before losing the Europa League final. They have splashed the cash this summer, signing Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo, with a deal for Benjamin Sesko close, and will expect to see results on the pitch this season.",
      "“The club has to compete at the highest level that is appropriate to the size and history of the club,” Ratcliffe said. “While a world-class training facility won’t take us to that position alone, it is one of the key ingredients in the modern facility. Now we have one.",
      "“When I first came to Carrington two years ago, we had a presentation here. It was clear then. It is an excellent facility. It was [leading edge[ I am sure in 2000, but 25 years later it wasn’t at quite the level it needed to be for one of the top four or five clubs in the world.”",

That's Diogo. Then Darwin might be on the verge of leaving. Luis Diaz was a definite starter, and Trent [Alexander-Arnold] was a definite starter.",

      "Wrexham boss Phil Parkinson has refused to confirm whether his side are set to sign Liverpool starlet Lewis Koumas. The youngster has been linked with a season-long loan switch to the Championship side.",

      "It is understood that, even if a new striker is signed by Newcastle, they will not u-turn on their firm stance regarding Isak's future. Howe has been aware of the hierarchy's stance has been left to smooth things out with the player.",
      "Newcastle's decision not to officially discipline the player has been a conscious decision. Isak didn't go on their pre-season tour of Asia but later was seen training at former club Real Sociedad. The club are aware that it will be easier to reintegrate him into the squad if they take a soft approach in that sense.",
      "Alexander Isak has been left fuming after Newcastle made it clear to him that he will not be sold this summer - ending his hopes of a move to Liverpool.",
      "The Swede was told of the club's decision with the Telegraph reporting he did not take it well and will continue training away from the first-team. Isak has been informed that, until he accepts that he will not be getting the move away he wanted, he will not play for Newcastle after being left out of their pre-season games.",
      "Eddie Howe has been the club's spokesperson and had been open and honest about the possibility that Isak could leave the club after three years, but their Saudi Arabian have taken a hard line regarding their refusal to sell.",
      "“The history of Manchester United is obviously very special but what really excites me is the future.",
      "“When we discussed the project, it was clear that everything is in place for this team to continue to grow and compete for the biggest trophies again soon.",
      "“From the moment that I arrived, I could feel the positive energy and family environment that the club has created. It is clearly the perfect place to reach my maximum level and fulfil all of my ambitions.",
      "“I cannot wait to start learning from Ruben [Amorim] and connecting with my team-mates to achieve the success that we all know we are capable of together.”",
      "Man United have officially won the race for Benjamin Sesko after hijacking Newcastle's move for the striker. Sesko, 22, arrives from German club RB Leipzig in a deal worth up to £74million.",
      "Ruben Amorim's side will pay £66.4m up front plus a further £7.6m in potential add-ons. Sesko has signed a five-year contract, keeping him at Old Trafford until June 2030.",
      "Jakub Kiwior is interested in leaving Arsenal for a club who'd guarantee him regular game time. Since joining the Gunners from Italian side Spezia in January 2023, Poland international Kiwior largely been a stopgap for his injured team-mates.",
      "The 25-year-old enjoyed a solid run of starts in the spring following Gabriel Magalhaes' season-ending injury and was the subject of interest from Porto, whose £26m bid was rejected by Arsenal. But that might not be the end of interest in Kiwior, as the Athletic report that he's keen to explore opportunities with clubs where he'd be considered a first-choice player."

      "While Manchester United are weighing up a blockbuster approach for Carlos Baleba, some believe the club already have an even greater midfield prodigy in their midst. And these aren't just ordinary observers – we're talking about 10 Ballon d'Or winners.",
      "Earlier this week, it emerged that the Red Devils have set their sights on Brighton's Baleba, with manager Ruben Amorim keen to bring in a defensive midfielder after successfully strengthening his forward line. Brighton, however, are unwilling to part ways with the 21-year-old, who has effortlessly filled Moises Caicedo's sizeable shoes after the Ecuadorian left for Chelsea in 2023.",
      "Internally, United accept that signing Baleba this summer will be no easy task, as Brighton are expected to demand around £100million for the Cameroon star. Meeting that figure would push United's transfer outlay for the summer towards – and potentially beyond – the £300m mark with Benjamin Sesko also arriving at Old Trafford.",
      "Considering the hefty asking price and the club's precarious financial state, many question whether the pursuit is worth it, particularly as United already boast a gifted young midfielder in Kobbie Mainoo. The 20-year-old is seen as one of Europe's most exciting emerging players, underlined by his third-place finish in last year's Kopa Trophy – awarded to the best footballer under the age of 21 – trailing only Arda Guler and winner Lamine Yamal.",
      "The prize, introduced in 2018, is voted on by a panel of former Ballon d'Or winners – 10 of whom ranked Mainoo in their top three. That distinguished group features Michael Owen, Marco van Basten, Kaka, Andriy Shevchenko, Ruud Gullit, Pavel Nedved, Matthias Sammer, Jean-Pierre Papin, Igor Belanov and Gianni Rivera.",
      "Mainoo missed out on this year's shortlist after a stop-start season disrupted by injuries, yet optimism remains high within United that he can rediscover the consistency and spark that made him the academy's latest breakout star.",
      "His current deal runs until 2027, with negotiations for an extension ongoing but paused since last year. United do hold an option to prolong his contract by an additional year, though that hasn't prevented exit rumours from swirling in recent months.",
      "Should uncertainty over Mainoo's future persist, United's pursuit of Baleba could gather pace. That said, securing one isn't necessarily contingent on pinning down the other.",
      "While both operate in central midfield, Baleba is a more orthodox ball-winning No. 6, whereas Mainoo excels at advancing possession and adding creative thrust.",
      "If anything, they'd form an electrifying pairing, combining energy and tenacity off the ball with incisive passing and fast, fluid interplay on it – precisely the dynamic Amorim is eager to cultivate in midfield.",
      "For the moment, Brighton retain the upper hand in any negotiations over Baleba. The player is under contract for another three years, and the Seagulls have built a reputation for driving hard bargains – banking big sums for the likes of Caicedo, Marc Cucurella, Joao Pedro and Ben White.",
      "Whether United choose to seriously test Brighton's resolve remains to be seen, but if they do, prising Baleba away will likely be a drawn-out and fiercely contested battle.",

    "body": [
      "In the late 1980s and early 1990s, Lee Sharpe was one of English football’s brightest young stars.",
      "Plucked from Torquay United by Sir Alex Ferguson at just 17, the talented winger quickly made his mark at Manchester United, becoming a key figure in the club’s resurgence in the early 1990s.",
      "Known for his skill on the pitch and photogenic good looks off it, Sharpe helped United secure three Premier League titles, two FA Cups and a League Cup during his eight‑year stay at Old Trafford.",
      "But his life at the top came with its challenges. Ferguson was famous for his “hairdryer treatment,” and Sharpe often found himself on the receiving end.",
      "Speaking to The Sun, he recalled one brutal halftime dressing‑down after a poor performance at Anfield: “He gave me the biggest rollicking of my life and told me to sell my house, move my girlfriend back home and get out there and play!”",
      "The player followed those instructions, later adding: “He asked me now and then after that if I had a girlfriend or if I was married, but I always told him I’d got rid of my girlfriend, wasn’t getting married and not to ask me again!”",
      "As United rose to dominate the newly formed Premier League, Sharpe embodied the image of the modern footballer - talented, well‑paid and living life in the fast lane.",
      "But injuries and a loss of form saw his Old Trafford career stall, leading to moves to Leeds United and Bradford City before he finally retired from professional football in 2004. And that’s when Sharpe’s post‑football life took an unexpected turn.",
      "In 2005, just a year after hanging up his boots, Sharpe became a household name all over again - this time on television. He joined the cast of Celebrity Love Island, an early version of the now‑famous ITV dating show.",
      "There, he struck up a romance with TV presenter Jayne Middlemiss, who told viewers she had “never felt like this about anyone before.” But their relationship didn’t survive the cameras - Sharpe famously dumped Middlemiss for fellow contestant Abi Titmuss before the series ended.",
      "The headlines didn’t stop there. Sharpe and Titmuss’ short‑lived romance soon fell apart amid allegations of cheating.",
      "In her memoir, Titmuss recalled the painful moment she discovered his alleged infidelity: “I feel like I’m being physically torn in half. I have my boyfriend looking me straight in the eye, telling me he loves me and totally denying it. And in my hand I have the front page of a national paper with a woman swearing he had slept with her.”",
      "It was the beginning of a tabloid storm. Over the following months, Sharpe was linked to promotions worker Kathryn Shaw - who described meeting him “on a little bridge near Rochdale” - and former Big Brother contestant Lisa Jeynes, who claimed they had a “marathon sex session that went on for hours.”",
      "Other rumoured relationships included actress Kym Marsh and singer Michelle Heaton, strengthening Sharpe’s reputation as one of football’s original playboys.",
      "But away from the gossip pages, Lee Sharpe's life was quietly beginning to change. By 2011, he had met Lucy Gardner, the woman who would become his wife.",
      "Six years later, he proposed at a Cheltenham Races fundraiser in front of more than 250 guests. “It was absolutely wonderful to witness,” said Cathryn Hage of the Pied Piper charity, which hosted the event.",
      "In 2019, the couple married on the Amalfi Coast and later relocated to Spain, where they now raise their three children. His Instagram bio reads: “Ex‑Manchester United, Leeds United and England Footballer, Golf Fanatic, Husband & Dad,” a nod to the family‑oriented life he now leads.",
      "Life on the Spanish coast has given Sharpe a chance to step away from his headline‑grabbing past and pursue a new passion - golf.",
      "“I’ve always loved golf,” he told the Express in 2023. “I started playing when I got to United when I was 17… The idea was that I was going to try and qualify for the British Open as an amateur.”",
      "Now, he’s working towards turning professional in Spain: “Over here, it’s a bit of a different regime… That’s what I’m trying to do at the moment: turn pro in Spain.”",
      "Despite building a life abroad, Sharpe still makes time for his roots. A recent Instagram post showed him enjoying time back in the UK, captioned: “A fantastic 2‑week trip back to the UK to see friends and family, North and South.

      "Manchester United drew 1-1 with Fiorentina before winning a penalty shootout in their final pre-season outing on Saturday.",
      "United unveiled their four summer signings and paid tribute to David de Gea ahead of kick off, but the visitors were keen to spoil the party and they went ahead early on through Simon Sohm. United soon hit back from a corner as Robin Gosens put through his own net under pressure from Leny Yoro and Casemiro.",
      "Matheus Cunha went close with a drilled effort in the second half and Fiorentina hit the bar, but neither side could find a winner as the game ended 1-1.",
      "A penalty shootout followed the 90 minutes which United won 5-4.",
      "Here are how the players rated at Old Trafford:",
      "Altay Bayindir",
      "Had no chance for the goal and had little else to do. Saved a penalty in the shootout to help United retain the Snapdragon Cup. 6",
      "Leny Yoro",
      "Lined up for the fourth game running and helped force the equaliser from Gosens' own goal. A solid end to an encouraging pre-season. 6",
      "Harry Maguire",
      "A leggy start but settled after United stopped playing walking football. Had a shot at goal repelled by De Gea. 6",
      "Ayden Heaven",
      "Looked like he hadn't started in two weeks and too casual at times. Went down injured in the second half and had to go off. 6",
      "Amad",
      "One of two players who have started all five friendlies. Linked up promisingly with Bryan Mbeumo again down the right. Panenka'd his penalty. 7",
      "Casemiro",
      "Plodded around for much of the contest to serve as a reminder of how much of a minefield United's midfield is. 5",
      "Bruno Fernandes",
      "United fans chanted his name before a kick, they're that pleased he's staying. Demanding of teammates, as ever, and proactive from a deeper role. 7",
      "Patrick Dorgu",
      "Failed to maintain his tour form on a sheepish return to Old Trafford as most of United's attacking play came down the opposite side. 6",
      "Bryan Mbeumo",
      "Another enterprising performance as he played for an hour after getting 45 minutes in Atlanta. A threatening presence before he was moved up front. 7",
      "Matheus Cunha",
      "Returned to his favoured role on the left of the front three but on the fringes for the majority on a frustrating afternoon. Shot wide in the second half. Came close to scoring a winner. Nonchalantly converted a penalty. 6",
      "Mason Mount",
      "Oddly started up front when he has struggled to do much in roles he is familiar with at United. Moved back to one of the 10s in the second half. Linked up well to create a chance for Cunha. 5",
      "Subs",
      "Diogo Dalot",
      "Came on late. 6",
      "Luke Shaw",
      "Replaced the injured Heaven. 6",
      "Matthijs de Ligt",
      "Closed down Moise Kean. 6",
      "Kobbie Mainoo",
      "Little time to impress but scored penalty. 6",
      "Manuel Ugarte",
      "Hardly had the ball. 5",

    "body": [
      "Having commemorated the old and the new at their renovated Carrington hub on Friday, the theme continued at Old Trafford on Saturday. Manchester United supporters welcomed Benjamin Sesko and bid a formal farewell to David de Gea.",
      "As there was a cup to play for, De Gea was withdrawn before the shootout. During his United career, he once conceded 40 consecutive spotkicks, the nadir coming with the 11 that flew past him in the 2021 Europa League final. De Gea did save one on his final appearance for the club at Old Trafford. He was granted a rapturous standing ovation upon his removal.",
      "United completed a cup double: the Premier League Summer Series and Snapdragon Cup. Neither should adorn any of the alcoves the players walk past on the new stairwell at Carrington. They still played 'Glory glory Man United'. Any excuse.",
      "The attack is boxed off for United in this transfer window but uncertainty remains over the goalkeeper. Andre Onana, absent for their entire pre-season schedule, expects to be fit for the visit of Arsenal next Sunday. Altay Bayindir's United career is memorable only for his penalty saves in the FA Cup win at Arsenal and his denial decided the shootout.",
      "All four of United's summer recruits were paraded before kick-off, each afforded a flattering introduction. The loudest cheer was predictably reserved for Sesko, barely two hours after his £73.62million signing was confirmed.",
      "The players soon emerged and the Stretford End burst into a chorus of \"Bruno, Bruno, Bruno\". Despite more than £200million invested in the attack, United matchgoers are particularly grateful to Fernandes for sticking around for another season.",
      "Sesko will not struggle to make the starting XI next week. Ruben Amorim selected a strikerless side for the second match running and a United player did not get on the scoresheet until the spotkicks.",
      "The start was played at the glacial pace of Glyndebourne when United ought to be prepared for a Glastonbury experience against Arsenal next week. The walking football was punished in the seventh minute through Simon Solomon Junior Sohm's half-volley direct from a corner that drifted towards the edge of the area.",
      "Amorim has not had a consistent back three across pre-season. Leny Yoro has started in four of the five friendlies but this was Harry Maguire's and Ayden Heaven's second starts of the schedule. Heaven limped off in the second half, which could deprive him of a start against his former club and pave the way for the lean Luke Shaw to be recalled.",
      "Fernandes immediately demanded more urgency from teammates following the opening goal and United burst into De Gea's area for the first time. United's most threatening attempts tended to come from defenders. Yoro and Maguire drew routine stops from De Gea.",
      "As late as the 79th minute, Fernandes was cajoling the sheepish Patrick Dorgu, at risk of regressing. A minute later, Dorgu charged towards De Gea with more gusto than he had displayed in nearly 80 minutes.",
      "United's only senior striker cannot get in the team as he is on his way out. Amorim is no longer concealing his distrust of Rasmus Hojlund, benched for the third game out of five in pre-season and second in succession. To add insult to injury, Mason Mount, recruited as a central midfielder two years ago, was picked up front.",
      "Mount, possibly picked on the strength of his wonderful hit against Everton in Atlanta, has played in four different positions now for United. This still reflected more damningly on Hojlund, a sellable asset United are actively seeking buyers for. Hojlund was in a carefree mood during his warm up, opting for some ball juggling. He was completely unused.",
      "Given Mount has done little of note playing in positions he is familiar with in two years at United, he was never going to cut it in an unforgiving role so alien to him. The experiment lasted 45 minutes and Bryan Mbeumo moved up front for the second half.",
      "It would have been more beneficial for the players and signings to operate in the system with an actual striker up top and it spoke volumes that the equaliser was an own goal. The support striker for Sesko is Joshua Zirkzee, still injured and neither here nor there. Amorim considers him more of a No.10.",
      "De Gea marked his return with a reenactment of some of his iffy keeping in his first United season as he was bundled over from a corner. The ball bounced in off Robin Gosen's noggin amid a challenge from Yoro, who sympathetically helped his counterpart back to his feet.",
      "Mbeumo and Amad are quickly developing a telepathic partnership on the right-hand side. Cunha was not as prominent and held a lengthy conflab with Amorim during a stoppage in the 31st minute. Fernandes headed over a few minutes later for some additional guidance.",
      "Fernandes scored for the fourth time this pre-season in the shootout. There was nothing new there.",

      "David de Gea insists there are no hard feelings over his departure from Manchester United two years ago.",
      "De Gea, United's seventh-highest appearance holder, was granted a formal farewell on his first appearance back at Old Trafford in Saturday's 1-1 draw with Fiorentina.",
      "The 34-year-old was released by United in July 2023 after the club decided against offering him a new contract, having decided against triggering the one-year option in his deal.",
      "Erik ten Hag, the United manager at the time, opted to replace De Gea with his former Ajax custodian Andre Onana, who joined in a £47.2million transfer from Inter Milan.",
      "Onana has had two error-strewn seasons and missed the entirety of United's pre-season schedule with a hamstring injury. Onana is hopeful of regaining fitness for the Premier League opening fixture against Arsenal next week.",
      "De Gea is under contract at Fiorentina until 2028. La Viola finished sixth last season to qualify for the Europa League and De Gea helped them to reach the Europa Conference League semi-finals in his first season.",
      "\"Sometimes football is like it is,\" De Gea said of his United exit. \"You can't control everything. I've been here 12 years, very, very nice, it's one of the best periods of my life.",
      "\"Playing for this club is just unbelievable, especially when you leave the club, you realise how big is the club, how difficult it was to be 12 years in a club like United. I'm always grateful for this club, for everyone, it's been an amazing journey.",
      "\"Great, sometimes it’s difficult to describe with words how you feel on the pitch, seeing the crowd, the players, everybody there, it was emotional for me. It’s a game that I’ll never forget for sure.\"",
      "United came eighth and 15th in successive seasons without De Gea, their lowest finishes since 1990. The club salvaged the 2023-24 season with an FA Cup triumph but lost to Tottenham Hotspur in the Europa League final last season.",
      "De Gea, who went more than a year without playing until he joined Fiorentina a year ago, is hopeful United will regain form in Ruben Amorim's first full season.",
      "\"Sometimes this is football, you can't win all the time,\" De Gea added. \"I know it's been some years that United struggle a bit but it's one of the best clubs in the world, it's a massive club and hopefully this year with the new signings and the manager starting a new era they can do something big and that's it.",
      "\"Hopefully this year they can win something and be there where they deserve.\"",
      "De Gea joined United at the age of 21 in 2011 from Atletico Madrid for £18.9m and went on to play 545 times for the club. De Gea set new records for most appearances by a United 'keeper and most clean sheets.",
      "The former Spain international met up with Sir Alex Ferguson during Fiorentina's stay in Manchester and reconnected with former teammate and friend Bruno Fernandes, who presented De Gea with a commemorative frame before kick-off at Old Trafford.",
      "\"It was great,\" De Gea said of his return. \"It’s been a long time since I came back here so it’s been a special day. Old friends, people that I’ve been with a lot of time, I had a lot of love from them. Very special coming to Old Trafford, onto the pitch, with nearly a full stadium, it was amazing.",
      "\"He (Ferguson)’s the boss, the reason why I came to United. So yeah, he’s very important to me. He’s always talking to me, helping, he’s a legend for the club, everybody loves him. So happy to see him.\"",

      "\"They have a lot of mobility and we struggle to find the right moment to press. But then we controlled the game and I think we had a lack of fluidity in the game. We can do better.",

      "Manchester United have confirmed the signing of Benjamin Sesko from RB Leipzig.",
      "Sesko arrives at Old Trafford for a fee of €76.5million (£66.4m) and €8.5m (£7.3m) in add-ons, and the striker has signed a five-year contract.",
      "United were confident Sesko preferred a move to Manchester over Newcastle and moved swiftly to wrap up a deal. Newcastle submitted a more lucrative package, but Sesko's preference was decisive.",
      "In a statement, United said: \"Manchester United is pleased to confirm that Benjamin Sesko has joined the club, subject to registration. The Slovenia international has signed a contract until June 2030.",
      "\"Over the past two seasons, Sesko has scored the most goals of any player under the age of 23 in Europe’s top five leagues. The 22-year-old scored 21 goals and registered six assists for RB Leipzig during the last campaign.",
      "\"He has already been capped 41 times and scored 16 goals for Slovenia since becoming his country's youngest-ever debutant in 2021.\"",
      "After Aston Villa reiterated Ollie Watkins was not for sale, United turned their attention to Sesko. This summer was earmarked for a move away from Leipzig for Sesko, who attracted interest from Arsenal at the beginning of the window.",
      "United were interested in signing Sesko in the summer of 2022 and his agent visited Carrington, but the forward decided to sign for Leipzig from the fellow Red Bull franchise FC Salzburg.",
      "Sesko is regarded as one of Europe's most exciting young centre-forwards. He scored 39 goals in 87 appearances for Leipzig and has netted 16 goals in 41 games for Slovenia's national team.",
      "The 22-year-old travelled to Manchester in a private jet on Thursday evening alongside his agent, Elvis Basanovic, to complete his transfer to United.",
      "The confirmation of Sesko's transfer means Ruben Amorim has overhauled his attack in a single window, following a season in which United scored just 44 goals in the Premier League.",
      "United spent an initial combined £127.5m to sign Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo from Wolves and Brentford respectively. United have deliberately gone for Premier League-proven players, but staff believe Sesko can develop into one of the world's best strikers.",

      "Greenwood provided an assist for Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang’s second-half goal to make it 3-1. But he was also involved in some feisty scenes towards the end of the so-called friendly.",
      "As reported by BirminghamLive, the former United man ‘kicked out’ at Villa midfielder Amadou Onana in frustration after losing the ball.",

      "It wasn’t long after the incident that Greenwood was substituted, leaving the field without his shirt.",
      "The incident comes amid speculation over Greenwood’s future at Marseille. In his first season with the French club he scored 22 goals and provided six assists in 36 games.",
      "Those numbers and his performances has led to clubs being linked with an interest in the 23-year-old. Most recently Saudi side Al Nassr have been linked, although Marseille have made it clear that they do not want to sell.",
      "It is added that an offer of over £85 million would have to be made to even start conversations over the forward. That would be of benefit to United who included a 50 percent sell-on clause in the deal that saw Greenwood move to Marseille last summer.",

      "The midfielder, 21, has emerged as a candidate to become the club's fifth signing of the summer at Old Trafford after Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo, Benjamin Sesko and Diego Leon have all been added to Ruben Amorim's squad.",
      "Reports this week have stated that United have made contact with Brighton via intermediaries to explore the conditions over a potential move. The Seagulls are understood to be adamant om keeping Baleba at the AMEX Stadium for another year, at least.",
      "United have been linked with a host of midfielders this summer with that position said to be one that Amorim is keen to bolster. Doubts over Casemiro's status at this level remain present and Manuel Ugarte is yet to cement a spot in the line-up since his move 12 months ago.",
      "Baleba, who would likely cost between £100million and £115million, is reportedly ready to say yes to a move to Old Trafford if a financial package is agreed between the two clubs. It remains to be seen whether that will be the case with just three weeks left of the window.",
      "The Seagulls are playing their final pre-season match of the summer before they kick-off their Premier League schedule against Fulham next weekend, and Baleba was nowhere to be seen.",
      "However, the midfielder has missed a large portion of pre-season due to an ongoing knee injury. After the last three friendlies, Fabian Hurzeler said he hoped Baleba would return to training this week.",
      "The Sussex Express have reported that Baleba's absence against the Bundesliga outfit is down to his injury. It's claimed the Cameroonian is working his way back to match fitness.",

      "Manchester United finally have their man as new signing, Benjamin Sesko, smiled and waved in front of a joyous Old Trafford crowd on Saturday.",
      "United desperately needed a new No.9 after scoring a meagre 44 goals in the Premier League last season. No one yet knows if the arrivals of Sesko, Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha will fix United's biggest weakness, from last term, but they certainly should offer a greater chance of firepower to a team that badly needed it.",
      "However, no one at M16 is under the impression that United's problems have been solved by one summer transfer window. Sales will be the next priority, with wantaway stars Alejandro Garnacho, Tyrell Malacia, and Antony all still training from the main group at Carrington.",
      "But the evidence on display in United's final pre-season friendly of the summer - against Fiorentina this weekend - suggests that one glaring weakness is only likely to hold Ruben Amorim's team back. Brazilian midfielder Casemiro looked every bit of his 33 years against the Serie A side.",
      "It continued a running theme of the former Real Madrid star's recent career at United. After impressing during his debut campaign under then-United boss Erik ten Hag - age and injuries appeared to catch up with him soon after.",
      "He began to improve towards the end of 2024/2025 as he played an important role in United's run to the Europa League final. However, Father Time can only be held off for so long, and the club may be making a mistake if they don't go on to sign a replacement before the summer window closes on September 1.",
      "Brighton's Carlos Baleba has been heavily linked in recent days - and it's easy to see why. The Cameroonian's pace, power and technical ability would make him an asset to any team.",
      "At 21, he still remains the unfinished article, and there must be some concern that United may be looking to target too many unproven talents.",
      "Brighton's hard-nosed stance may help United in that respect. The Seagulls are said to want around £100million for their star midfielder - so it won't be the worst scenario for all parties if he spends one more year on the south coast to develop further.",
      "However, it would surprise no one if the young star becomes United's next new signing under Ineos.",

      "The United boss has been busy bolstering his squad throughout the summer transfer window with four new faces through the door. Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko have all been big-money purchases while Diego Leon has provided depth in defence.",
      "It's understood now that Omar Berrada and Jason Wilcox will prioritise a new midfielder before the window closes on September 1. A move for Brighton's Carlos Baleba has been muted while Crystal Palace's Adam Wharton and Atalanta's Ederson are also on their radar.",
      "However, Andre Onana's form since moving to United has resulted in doubts over his future at the club. Various reports have indicated that Amorim wants a new number one to compliment his style of play but no move has played out yet.",
      "Interest in Gianluigi Donnarumma has developed over the course of the window. After helping Paris Saint-Germain win the Champions League last season, the Italy number one is expected to leave the club this summer.",
      "With just one year left on his deal, Donnarumma is yet to agree to new terms and the signing of Lucas Chevalier from LOSC Lille has placed more doubt over his future. United have been linked with the former AC Milan star this summer to come in and be Amorim's number one.",
      "United's hopes of signing a new goalkeeper rely on the potential sale of Andre Onana, something that seems unlikely at this stage. With three weeks of the window left, a new midfielder is the priority.",
      "On Saturday, Amorim was asked by a supporter outside Old Trafford if the Reds were signing Donnarumma. The fan asked: \"Hey Ruben, who we signing? Are we getting Donnarumma?\"",
      "Amorim replied with: \"Sorry?\" before the fan repeated the question about the Italian. Whilst signing autographs, the United boss chuckled without a response.",

      "Ruben Amorim described Mason Mount's work rate as \"unbelievable\" after the friendly with Fiorentina.",
      "Amorim named Rasmus Hojlund on the bench for the final pre-season friendly of the summer at Old Trafford, opting to start Mount down the middle in the false nine role instead.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo was then moved into the middle for the second half, which meant Mount relocated to the right. Hojlund was an unused substitute and his future at Old Trafford is uncertain after Benjamin Sesko's arrival.",
      "Hojlund does not appear to be in Amorim's plans for 2025/26, but Amorim hasn't hidden his affection for Mount and briefly praised the midfielder again after the clash with Fiorentina.",
      "\"It's unbelievable,\" said Amorim on Mount's work rate. \"The way he works, moving all the time and he knows all the positions, but also the other guys. It was a good test to prepare for the first time.\"",
      "Amorim has been full of praise for Mount since his arrival in Manchester, even claiming he \"loves\" the former Chelsea man because of his desire to succeed.",
      "\"The first thing is he's [Mount] working really hard,\" Amorim said in November. \"Then you have to understand the human also - he wants this really badly, and that is the most important thing. He has proved he is a really talented player. He was a European champion, so we believe in him a lot.\"",
      "Mount has suffered a few minor muscle injuries since his arrival from Chelsea in 2023, but he enjoyed a clear run at the end of last season and started in the Europa League final in May.",
      "Speaking in the US during United's pre-season tour, Mount said: \"He [Amorim]'s definitely given that confidence to me from the first day he came in, speaking to me, and I know what he wants, and I feel like I know how he wants the team to play. And, obviously, I've had some experience in that role [No.10] as well.",
      "\"So that helps with the younger lads coming in and me helping them understand the positions of the formation and everything. So yeah, it's been brilliant and definitely having that confidence, the manager has that confidence in me to go out there and perform, it definitely helps as a player.\"",
      "Mount also backed himself to earn a place in Amorim's starting XI, despite the arrivals of Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha. \"Any opportunity you get, you've got to try and take it. And, yeah, I mean, I'll always back myself,\" he said.",
      "\"I know what I can do. But we're a team and we're all working together in that. Obviously with the new signings coming in, they [Cunha and Mbeumo] are going to elevate us to another level and we all need to be at that level to really perform.\"",

      "Manchester United are preparing for a hectic end to the summer transfer window. After getting Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo through the door earlier in the window, Ruben Amorim could still welcome three new players to his squad.",
      "Improvements to United's attack have been made with Cunha and Mbeumo adding 35 Premier League goals to a team that struggled in front of goal. Diego Leon has also arrived from Paraguay to become the latest wonderkid to be signed under Ineos.",
      "It's expected the Slovenia striker will be unveiled as Amorim's new centre-forward at Old Trafford on Saturday ahead of the pre-season friendly against Fiorentina. With three weeks until the window slams, United have two more positions to deal with.",
      "Another new goalkeeper has been touted since the window opened, but a replacement for Andre Onana currently seems unlikely to come in. The priority after Sesko is expected to be a new midfielder - with Brighton's ball-winning sensation Carlos Baleba on their radar.",
      "It's been reported that United have made contact with the Seagulls - via intermediaries - over the possibility of a move for the Cameroon international. Since signing from LOSC Lille, Baleba has attracted interest with his displays at the AMEX Stadium and United are huge admirers.",
      "However, it has been widely reported that Brighton value the midfielder at £100million, a figure close to the one they received for Moises Caicedo in 2023 - from Chelsea. It's clear United would have to construct a near-perfect financial package to reach an agreement.",
      "Despite Brighton's asking price, the latest figures released by the CIES Football Observatory indicate the midfielder should be valued between €75m (£65m) and €87m (£75.4m). Using a sample of over 8,000 transfers, the website evaluates prices of players from the five major European top-flights using the statistical technique of multiple linear regression, with fees paid by clubs as an independent variable.",
      "It's understood that Brighton don't want to sell Baleba - at least for another year - but that hasn't stopped them cashing in on other highly-rated players, such as Joao Pedro, Alexis Mac Allister and Pervis Estupinan, throughout the years.",
      "According to Fabrizio Romano, United are aware that the Seagulls will be hard to negotiate with. However, it's still reckoned that Baleba would be ready to say yes to a move to Old Trafford this summer, even without the prospect of them playing in Europe.",

      "'Take me home, United road' is a pre-match staple at Old Trafford nowadays.",
      "And incoming signing Benjamin Sesko is poised to hear Manchester United fans belt it out for the very first time ahead of Saturday's pre-season finale against Fiorentina.",
      "The plan is for him to be unveiled to his new army of supporters ahead of the clash with the Italian side, similarly to the way Rasmus Hojlund was presented to the fans ahead of United's penultimate pre-season friendly of the summer against RC Lens two years ago.",
      "Like Hojlund, there is also a very high probability Sesko will make his United debut against Arsenal. Furthermore, they have also ended up at Old Trafford via spells in Austria.",
      "With the duo sharing a cluster of similarities, United supporters will just be hoping Sesko is more potent inside the penalty area. The Slovenian is on the cusp of joining the club from RB Leipzig in a deal that is going to cost £73.7million.",
      "He arrived in Manchester on Thursday evening and is now in the process of putting the finishing touches to the move. He will become United's fourth signing of the summer and their third new addition to the attacking department.",
      "After finishing last season with a negative goal difference of -10, United have prioritised attacking signings this summer. Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo arrived from Wolves and Brentford on the back of highly successful seasons, scoring 17 and 20 goals respectively.",
      "Sesko is on the brink of joining the Reds on the back of a 21-goal season in Germany. Given he did not turn 22 until the very end of May, 21 goals in a season at the age of 21 marked a respectable haul.",
      "It marked the second time he had smashed his way through the 20-goal barrier in a single season in his senior career. He scored 13 times in the Bundesliga and chipped in with four goals apiece in the Champions League and DFB-Pokal.",
      "He previously went beyond the 20-goal barrier in 2020/21, also scoring 21 times, during a season-long loan spell at FC Liefering in the Austrian second division.",
      "In comparison, Hojlund has never scored 20 goals or more in a single season in his senior career. His best return in a single campaign is 16 - a landmark he reached in his first season at United and previously in the 2022/23 campaign.",
      "Hojlund's record in his first season at Old Trafford was very respectable. Considering he had joined United injured and immediately found himself at the top of the pecking order with no adequate support in his department, it was a promising maiden season at the club.",
      "However, he regressed last season, scoring just ten goals, of which only four of them were scored in the Premier League. United need to be able to rely on a striker who is capable of scoring 20 goals a season, and Hojlund does not look like being that player.",
      "With the exception of Erling Haaland, whose record can only be described as freakish, not many young strikers have arrived in the Premier League in recent seasons and immediately hit the ground running by scoring a lorry load of goals.",
      "There is no guarantee of Sesko, despite being compared with Haaland, following in the Norwegian's footsteps, but United will take confidence from the fact he has smashed his way through the 20-goal-a-season barrier - and so recently.",
      "At the age of 22, the weight of pressure on Sesko's shoulders will be unlike anything he has experienced before. Few positions in world football are scrutinised as much as the centre-forward position at United.",
      "Sesko built up a respectable record at Leipzig, scoring 39 goals in 87 games. His Bundesliga record stands at 27 goals in 64 games.",
      "Signing him for such an eye-watering fee, United will demand instant results from him. However, they will take comfort from the fact he will be playing alongside two attackers so well-versed in the Premier League - and that could make a world of difference.",
      "Hojlund, by contrast, did not have that luxury. He was brought in to be the main man with no support acts.",
      "The pair of them have taken similar routes to Old Trafford, and they could both make their debuts against the same opponent. United will just be hoping the end result is different.",
      "The countdown is on to the 2025/26 Premier League campaign - and our pre-season guide is the ideal way to prepare for the action ahead.",

      "David De Gea is set to make his first return to Old Trafford since his Manchester United exit on Saturday.",
      "The 34-year-old left United in June 2023 - after 12 years with the club. During that time, De Gea made 545 appearances, winning the Premier League, FA Cup, Carabao Cup and Europa League among other honours.",
      "However, De Gea departed United following the expiration of his contract, leaving him as a free agent.",
      "United, meanwhile, replaced the Spain international with Andre Onana in a £47.5million deal from Inter Milan.",
      "There had been talk that De Gea could return straight to action and move to Saudi Arabia, but the ex-Atletico Madrid stopper instead spent a considerable amount of time out of the game. Indeed, De Gea did not sign for another club for more than 12 months - until August 2024 - when he made the move to Serie A side Fiorentina.",
      "De Gea made his debut in the Conference League against Puskas Akademia and went on to have a top debut season in Florence. In total, De Gea made 42 appearances, keeping 11 clean sheets and conceding just 50 goals.",
      "Now, De Gea, who signed a new three-year contract at Fiorentina back in May, is expected to make his return to United on Saturday when his side travel to Old Trafford for a pre-season friendly.",
      "But exactly how does De Gea feel about United, two years since he left the club? Well, speaking last summer, the Spaniard had nothing but positive things to say about his former employers.",
      "In his press conference after signing for Fiorentina, in August 2024, De Gea said: \"United is a top, top club and my heart will always be there. I never thought about retiring, it was just difficult to find motivations for a new chapter after 12 years at a top club like Manchester United... and I finally felt that at Fiorentina.",
      "\"I spent a year in Manchester, before returning to Madrid. I wanted to stay at a high level. I didn't stop. It's not easy to train alone. I spent two years in Manchester, it's my home. That's where my heart is set.",
      "\"It was difficult for me to find motivation to evaluate offers, so I decided to take a sabbatical.",
      "\"I am fit, I trained every day, even more than before. I am on a good level. Perhaps it will take some time in the first games, but I've been playing for many years, so you just need to put me in goal.\"",
      "De Gea's Fiorentina have already played two matches on English soil this week. They lost 2-0 to EFL Championship side Leicester City last Sunday before being held to a 0-0 draw at Nottingham Forest on Tuesday.",
      "As well as welcoming De Gea back, United will hold a presentation pre-match to honour De Gea's time at the club. Bruno Fernandes will lead the presentation - which will take place ahead of kick-off.",

      "Of those, only the latter has secured a move away after joining Barcelona on loan. Malacia spent the second half of last season on loan at PSV, but they did not exercise their option to make that move permanent.",

Matthew 5:14-16 \"You are the light of the world\", proclaiming: \"God is great.\" Joshua Zirkzee, another of his teammates during their time together at Feyenoord, responded by saying: \"Love it bro go get em !!\"",

      "Manchester United have identified Brighton midfielder Carlos Baleba as a potential target this summer.",
      "The Athletic reported this week that initial contact has already been made with the south coast club, though any potential arrival would, likely, depend on player departures - following United's summer spending spree. Marcus Rashford has already left the club to join Barcelona on loan, while talks over Alejandro Garnacho's move to Chelsea are still ongoing - although the Argentina international has reportedly already agreed on personal terms.",
      "Meanwhile, Baleba, who has three years remaining on his Brighton contract, is quickly emerging as one of the most highly-rated players in his position and has attracted the attention of the United hierarchy.",
      "According to ESPN, Brighton will demand €120million (£104m) for Baleba this summer. United are also mooted to face competition from Manchester City for his signature.",
      "Elsewhere, talkSPORT has suggested that the Seagulls would be willing to cash in on the midfielder, but not until next summer.",
      "Brighton's hierarchy reportedly believe Baleba has the potential to be as valuable as Moises Caicedo, whom they sold to Chelsea. Caicedo completed the transfer to Stamford Bridge, for a British record fee of £115million, in 2023.",
      "Toby Collyer will not be included as a makeweight in any potential deal for Baleba. While reports have stated he could be used as a sweetener to facilitate a proposed transfer - given his background within Brighton's academy before departing in 2022 - United have no plans to involve him in the negotiations.",
      "Born in Worthing, just 10 miles from Brighton, Collyer appeared destined to break into the first-team at the Amex Stadium before being released by the club. His future remains uncertain this summer.",
      "The midfielder has attracted loan interest, and there is also said to be interest from clubs looking to sign him on a permanent basis.",
      "Brighton's chief executive, Paul Barber, has played down speculation that United have been in contact over the possibility of signing Baleba.",
      "\"We've got some great talent, there's always going to be interest in our players,\" Barber said. Manchester United have not been in touch with me. From that point of view, speculation is speculation.",
      "\"We will always try to make sure we sell our best players at the right time, not just for the player but for us. If we end up doing that with any player, it's with the view to leave Fabian with a competitive squad, whatever happens. We don't want to sell our best players.",
      "\"Carlos is a fantastic talent who has a lot of years ahead of him.",
      "\"We hope he will be here for many years to come. But it's something that, as always, is subjective to the dynamics of the football world which isn't always predictable.\""

      "Earlier in the transfer window, Fernandes' future at Manchester United was uncertain and his agent met with Al-Hilal officials in Saudi Arabia to discuss a lucrative move to the Kingdom.",
      "Saudi reports claimed Fernandes had been offered a multi-million pound financial package to move to Al-Hilal. However, there was no formal contact between the clubs and Fernandes rejected their proposal.",
      "It has now emerged that Al Nassr were also interested in signing Fernandes this summer.",
      "Al Nassr's manager, Jorge Jesus, has admitted he wanted to bring Fernandes to Saudi, but he was informed the midfielder had already committed to remaining in Manchester.",
      "“I wanted to,\" Jesus told Sport Informa when asked about signing Fernandes. \"But Bruno decided on staying. We had already spoken last year. This year I knew he had made the decision to continue with Amorim.\"",
      "In June, Fernandes touched on his desire to play at the highest level when he explained his decision to reject Al-Hilal. And former Benfica boss Jesus reacted: “He is in a league that they say is the best in the world, but I do not agree. For me, it is the Spanish league [La Liga].\"",
      "When Fernandes discussed his decision, he said: \"It was a very exciting offer. The president of Al Hilal was very nice to me. They talked to my agent, but I spoke to my wife and family, and she asked me what I wanted to do with my future. Never did she say yes or no, or offer to make the decision for me.",
      "\"She's always been behind me with every decision. It would have been easy to change, even from a family point of view, as Ruben Neves and João Cancelo are there [with Al-Hilal].",
      "\"Our kids are used to each other, I'm used to them, but I want to play at the highest possible level, playing in the major competitions and I know I still can. And I'm happy about my decision.\"",

      "1) Florian Wirtz (Bayer Leverkusen to Liverpool) – £100m rising to £116m\nLiverpool’s quiet summer of 2024 certainly isn’t being repeated 12 months down the line with another Premier League trophy in the cabinet. And while there will certainly be more to come, it’s going to take something pretty special to top this blockbuster nine-figure signing.",
      "",
      "2) Hugo Ekitike (Eintracht Frankfurt to Liverpool) – £69m rising to £79m with add-ons\nEkitike should send Newcastle his regards for insisting dream Reds target Alexander Isak is not for sale, particularly after the Magpies had their own bid for him turned down before the Premier League champions came calling.",
      "",
      "3) Benjamin Sesko (RB Leipzig to Manchester United) – £66.2m rising to £73.4m with add-ons\nThe Red Devils turned to the 22-year-old after missing out on Liam Delap and Viktor Gyokeres, as they have taken a huge risk in a Rasmus Hojlund repeat when Ollie Watkins was right there.",
      "",
      "4) Bryan Mbeumo (Brentford to Manchester United) – £65m rising to £71m with add-ons\nIt was a painfully laborious chase but they’ve got there in the end. Turns out Sir Jim Ratcliffe can be ‘held to ransom’.",
      "",
      "5) Victor Osimhen (Napoli to Galatasaray) – £64.8m\nA pretty underwhelming outcome for Osimhen following years of links with Premier League clubs, especially Chelsea. But fair dos to him for rejecting the Saudi Pro League big bucks…",
      "",
      "6) Matheus Cunha (Wolves to Manchester United) – £62.5m\nSir Jim Ratcliffe’s cost-cutting scheme threatened Man Utd’s deal for Cunha as they had a ‘request’ rejected, but they eventually ‘met the terms’.",
      "",
      "7) Luis Diaz (Liverpool to Bayern Munich) – £60.5m rising to £64.8m with add-ons\nThis transfer is bad news for Newcastle fans. Alexander Isak to Liverpool is on, folks…",
      "",
      "8) Martin Zubimendi (Real Sociedad to Arsenal) – £60m\nLiverpool could not persuade Zubimendi to part with the mountains and food on offer in San Sebastian but when another opportunity to move to the Premier League came around a year later, the midfielder happily hopped aboard the Arsenal bandwagon.",
      "",
      "9) Mateo Retegui (Atalanta to Al Qadsiah) – £56.3m\nRetegui moves to Saudi after finishing as Serie A’s top scorer with 25 goals last season. Quite the coup.",
      "",
      "10) Viktor Gyokeres (Sporting to Arsenal) – £55m rising to £63m with add-ons\nIt is finally done. At last we can rest for five minutes.",
      "",
      "11) Joao Pedro (Brighton to Chelsea) – £55m rising to £60m with add-ons\nTwo years after joining Brighton from Watford for a club-record fee, the Seagulls have doubled their money on the Brazilian with the usual sale to Chelsea.",
      "",
      "12) Mohammed Kudus (West Ham to Tottenham) – £55m\nThis move will go down well in east London, we’re sure.",
      "",
      "13) Anthony Elanga (Nottingham Forest to Newcastle United) – £52m rising to £55m with add-ons\nNewcastle United have finally landed a right winger after missing out on targets in recent windows. Elanga, Anthony Gordon and Alexander Isak is a very fun front three…",
      "",
      "14) Dean Huijsen (Bournemouth to Real Madrid) – £50m\nReal Madrid matched Huijsen’s release clause just a year after he joined the Cherries for just £12.6m. The fee will be paid in three instalments by Real, with his former clubs Juventus due 10% and Malaga 5%.",
      "",

      "",
      "17) Tijjani Reijnders (AC Milan to Manchester City) – £46.6m rising to £59.2m with add-ons\nThe last of four signings rushed through in the first transfer window to prepare for the Club World Cup, as officially Serie A’s best midfielder in 2024/25 Reijnders might be the most intriguing.",

      "So we start with the tittle-tattle…",

      "20) 🔼 Gianluigi Donnarumma – PSG to Manchester United\nThis rumour keeps coming and going, but PSG’s signing of Lucas Chevalier certainly opens the door for Donnarumma’s departure, which was unthinkable when he was thwarting Arsenal, Aston Villa and Liverpool in the Champions League. ESPN reckon United, Chelsea and Inter are expected to make an offer. The Italian goalkeeper is in the final 12 months of his contract.",

      "",
      "18) 🆕 Bradley Barcola – PSG to Liverpool\nReports in France suggest Barcola is being considered as an alternative to Alexander Isak now that Darwin Nunez is on his way. But there are also suggestions that the Reds are not on the 23-year-old’s tail so we very much doubt this is a go-er. Nunez will be replaced, though.",
      "",
      "17) Jadon Sancho – Manchester United to Anyone\nIt was reported ages ago that an agreement had been reached with Juventus but nothing happened. Then Dortmund started sniffing again but still nothing happens. This will almost certainly go the way we expected it to: a loan move, late in the window when United get desperate to shift Sancho’s salary. At least they banked £5million when Chelsea decided they would prefer to pay to not sign him.",
      "MORE: Ten-striker transfer domino starts with Sesko to Newcastle and ends with Wissa via Isak to Liverpool",
      "",
      "16) 🔽 Carlos Baleba – Brighton to Manchester United\nBaleba would make United a very passable football team. But United are dealing with Brighton, which isn’t easy even when they aren’t reluctant to sell. Apparently, their preference is to hold on to the midfielder for another year before banking another record fee. If United – and Baleba, if that is his preference – can force the issue, they should. But we just can’t see it this summer.",
      "",
      "15) 🆕 Jorgen Strand Larsen – Wolves to Newcastle\nLarsen could be the next player to get the opportunity to snub Newcastle while they continue to tread on rakes. There have been whispers of the Toon’s interest in the striker throughout the summer, and Wolves could see an opportunity to milk their desperation.",
      "",
      "14) Samu Aghehowa – Porto to Newcastle\nVilla were interested before they spent £26million on Evann Guessand and we know Porto will sell if the price is right, so this could be a go-er. Assuming Newcastle bank a fee for Isak, Porto will want as close as possible to the £86million release clause in the 21-year-old’s contract. Or at least something like the Toon were willing to pay for Sesko.",
      "",
      "13) 🔼 Marc Guehi – Crystal Palace to Newcastle\nNewcastle were reportedly ‘back in’ for Guehi, but they’re signing a different centre-back. Chelsea, meanwhile, are pursuing other targets, which gives Liverpool a clear run at the Palace skipper.",
      "",
      "12) 🆕 Rasmus Hojlund – Manchester United to AC Milan\nPoor Hojlund played zero minutes against Fiorentina in Saturday’s friendly as Benjamin Sesko was paraded to the Old Trafford faithful. A loan move appears the most likely for the Dane, and Milan are ‘on it’, says Romano.",
      "",
      "11) 🆕 Dango Ouattara – Bournemouth to Brentford\nApparently, the Bees are one of a few clubs to have been in touch about the 23-year-old, who has told Bournemouth that he wants to explore his options. With all due respect, though, we doubt he had Brentford in mind when he was thinking about taking the next step.",
      "",
      "10) 🔽 Alexander Isak – Newcastle to Liverpool\nLiverpool’s first bid for Isak was made a week ago and very swiftly rejected by Newcastle. It was so emphatically rejected, in fact, that the champions reportedly won’t make a second bid. That leaves Isak in a very sticky situation, having burned plenty of bridges in the north east. But we doubt this is dead yet. And Newcastle have reportedly told a ‘furious’ Isak that he’s not leaving.",
      "RANKING: Isak crashes into best available strikers ranking as Liverpool eye £130m Newcastle rebel",
      "",
      "9) 🆕 Harvey Elliott – Liverpool to Tottenham\nThomas Frank was, well, frank in admitting that Spurs will need a replacement for James Maddison after the playmaker was ruled out for much of the season with an ACL injury. This makes sense if the two clubs can make the numbers work. And Liverpool want that number to be around £40million. RB Leipzig are keen. The Germans are unlikely to compete in a bidding war but they could offer a buy-back option which is said to be part of the conditions Liverpool have laid out.",
      "",
      "8) Eberechi Eze – Crystal Palace to Arsenal\nEze is the Gunners’ next top target after landing Viktor Gyokeres. And the England star has, apparently, been telling his mates he’s moving to the Emirates, but Arsenal are yet to deliver on Palace’s clear demand for his £68million buy-out clause to be met. Andrea Berta will doubtless spend weeks haggling over the number of instalments and Arsenal could really do with selling to make room in the squad and on the books for Eze.",
      "",
      "7) 🔼 Jack Grealish – Manchester City to Everton\nEverton want to give Grealish the get-out he needs from City but the Toffees will have to haggle hard over who pays the bulk of the winger’s wages since he currently earns well over double that of their highest earner. We want to see the old Grealish back and that could happen at Everton.",
      "",
      "6) 🔼 Yoane Wissa – Brentford to Newcastle\nEveryone seems to be turning down Newcastle recently, but Wissa is one player who does want to join the Magpies. Strongly enough to go up against Brentford while they rebuff the Toon’s interest. At least until the offers reach around £40million. Brentford want that to lose another of their top players and they can see the desperation dripping off Newcastle.",
      "",
      "5) Xavi Simons – RB Leipzig to Chelsea\nA Chelsea move appeals to Simons and the Blues are keen to make it happen. But they will look for a hefty discount on the £56million RB Leipzig are demanding for the one-time Arsenal target. Banking £20million for Broja will help.",
      "",
      "4) 🔼 Tyler Dibling – Southampton to Everton\nDavid Moyes has voiced his concerns about the Toffees’ lack of transfer activity, and his bosses have taken note. Dibling is reportedly the subject of a £40m offer, but the Saints want more. Dibling has been withdrawn from some aspects of training and wasn’t included in Will Still’s squad for their Championship opener, though, so a deal cannot be far off.",
      "",
      "3) 🔼 Alejandro Garnacho – Manchester United to Chelsea\nThe Blues have already signed Jamie Gittens this summer and are working on a deal for Xavi Simons. It doesn’t feel like they need Garnacho, but they’ve not required half the players they’ve signed in the Clearlake era. Talks are now ‘advancing’ between Chelsea and United. The Red Devils want at least £40million having watched Noni Madueke move for more.",
      "",
      "2) 🆕 Malick Thiaw – AC Milan to Newcastle\nWe have a Newcastle ‘Here we go’, and a player who ‘only wanted’ them. The end is nigh, folks.",
      "",
      "1) 🔼 Illia Zabarnyi – Bournemouth to PSG\nAndoni Iraola is going to be very short at the back for his side’s Premier League opener against Liverpool. Zabarnyi is set to follow Milos Kerkez and Dean Huijsen out of Bournemouth this summer.",

      "Rasmus Hojlund’s Manchester United career appears to be on borrowed time after he was sent a ‘clear message’ from Ruben Amorim, according to Fabrizio Romano.",
      "Hojlund can leave Old Trafford after the club signed RB Leipzig striker Benjamin Sesko for around £73million.",
      "The signing of Sesko was confirmed on Saturday and the Slovenian international was paraded in front of the United fans before they played Fiorentina in the Snapdragon Cup.",
      "After snubbing interest from Newcastle United to join the Red Devils, Sesko said: “The history of Manchester United is obviously very special but what really excites me is the future.",
      "“When we discussed the project, it was clear that everything is in place for this team to continue to grow and compete for the biggest trophies again soon.",
      "“From the moment that I arrived, I could feel the positive energy and family environment that the club has created. It is clearly the perfect place to reach my maximum level and fulfil all of my ambitions.",
      "“I cannot wait to start learning from Ruben [Amorim] and connecting with my team-mates to achieve the success that we all know we are capable of together.”",
      "The signing of Sesko means United need to sell players, with Alejandro Garnacho expected to join Chelsea for around £50m, while Antony and Jadon Sancho are also available.",
      "With Sesko now Ruben Amorim’s first-choice striker, Hojlund’s future at the club is uncertain.",
      "It has been reported that United want to loan out the Danish international, but are asking for a significant loan fee, his salary covered, and a buy option included.",
      "Leipzig reportedly brought Hojlund up during the Sesko negotiations, but the 22-year-old is not keen on moving to the German club.",
      "A return to Italy is the most likely scenario for the former Atalanta striker, with Juventus, Inter and AC Milan all believed to be interested.",
      "United are clearly keen on shifting the striker before the transfer deadline on September 1 and head coach Amorim has sent him a ‘clear message’ by not playing him against Fiorentina on Saturday afternoon.",
      "Those are the words of transfer journalist Fabrizio Romano, who says Milan are ‘on it’ after Hojlund was an unused substitute.",
      "Romano wrote on X: “Zero minutes for Rasmus Højlund today against Fiorentina, clear message coming from Man United.",
      "“As revealed two days ago, the club is prepared to let him leave on initial loan for €6m fee with salary covered plus buy option clause. AC Milan are on it.”",
      "Sesko is United’s fifth first-team signing of the summer after Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo, Diego Leon and Enzo Kana-Biyik.",
      "The addition of the 22-year-old makes Sir Jim Ratcliffe’s side the third-biggest spenders in the summer transfer window with a total of £208.4m.",
      "And they haven’t sold a single player. They better get moving fast…",
      "Fabrizio Romano has revealed that a Manchester United flop ‘insists’ on staying at the club despite them having ‘definitively opened doors’ to his exit.",
      "A new report has revealed when Rasmus Hojlund lost the support of Manchester United’s dressing room, while four concerns have come to light.",
      "Man Utd have ‘agreed a loan deal’ for Rasmus Hojlund with AC Milan in ‘pole position’ to get a deal over the line for the striker, according to reports.",
      "Benjamin Sesko’s imminent arrival means one Man Utd star is ‘resigned’ to the exit in a stunning ‘waste of investment’.",
      "Man Utd are buying another Rasmus Hojlund this summer as Benjamin Sesko will “need to adapt” to the Premier League, according to Rene Meulensteen.",
      "A new report has revealed Manchester United’s next signing after Benjamin Sesko as they have ‘three deals to complete’ in the coming weeks."

Full-backs Jeremie Frimpong and Milos Kerkez have joined for £29.5m and £40m respectively, and we have also added the £25m on Giorgi Mamardashvili as that transfer will be counted in this summer’s accounts."

      "With Spurs confirming the worst about James Maddison’s ACL injury and Thomas Frank offering a gloomy update on the fitness of Dejan Kulusevski after a 4-0 pre-season friendly defeat to Bayern Munich, it looks certain they will have to go back into the transfer market to do something about their moribund attacking options.",
      "Even the seemingly perfect – if emotional – end to Son Heung-min’s Tottenham career looks slightly different in the light of Maddison’s serious injury. The mischievous among you might well ask whether Spurs would even still have sanctioned his exit had the cat not been so entirely out of the bag before that game against Newcastle in Seoul.",
      "That’s a hypothetical, though, and what Spurs need is something real. Worth remembering they were pretty keen on signing Morgan Gibbs-White even before this Maddison setback. That ended… badly for Spurs. They could really do with at least one of these ending rather better over the next week or so.",
      "",
      "Nico Paz (Como)\nThere are conflicting reports about the seriousness and even existence of Spurs’ interest in the Como playmaker, but there would be something amiss if the 20-year-old wasn’t at least on their radar even before the last week’s unpleasantness.",
      "He would appear to have all the necessary tools for Spurs’ needs, but it’s a deeply difficult deal to do at a price Spurs are going to like with his former club Real Madrid entitled to 50 per cent of any fee and in keen and observant possession of a buy-back clause.",
      "",
      "Harvey Elliott (Liverpool)\nPerhaps not the most exciting of the options within the Premier League but in some ways the most interesting. After the way Elliott starred for England U21s this summer we really are incredibly keen to see what he can do given a full season of proper first-choice, first-team responsibility and there’s a compelling case that Spurs would now be the most fascinating place for that to happen.",
      "There really isn’t another club right now that can offer the same mix of opportunity and big stage for Elliott to prove he can take his age-group dominance into senior football.",
      "There’s nothing wrong with being happy as a vital and useful squad member at this excellent Liverpool side, but it does feel like he could be so much more somewhere else.",
      "",
      "Jack Grealish (Man City)\nIt seems like he’s going to be a key figure in the final weeks of the transfer window. It’s felt like everyone’s been playing a waiting game with Grealish this summer. We all know he’s going to leave City; the question is when and where to.",
      "We get the sense that he’s not yet ready to commit to the kind of teams that might have him at the top of their shopping list, and the teams he might be ready to commit to haven’t yet worked down their list of targets far enough to reach him.",
      "But the time where this game of chicken ends feels closer than ever after that Maddison injury. Even if it doesn’t kick Spurs into desperate action to find out whether the Aston Villa playmaker version of Grealish is still there lurking within the Guardiola automaton, it will surely make other interested parties get a wriggle on.",
      "We’re really not sure we want to see this one, purely because it would mean finding a new player to take second place on our list of the most Spurs player never to actually play for Spurs. Top spot is and always will be, of course, Stewart Downing’s.",
      "",
      "Ebere Eze (Crystal Palace)\nTottenham’s interest here is long-standing but Arsenal appear to have stolen a march on their local rivals this summer. But that deal remains undone and the chance for Spurs to make another move of their own is still there.",
      "Can they offer what Arsenal can? They cannot, but that cuts both ways. They can certainly offer him an easier route to unquestioned first-choice selection for 50-odd games in a World Cup year, for instance.",
      "As ever when talking about potential departures from Palace this summer, though, it is worth noting that they themselves are neither desperate nor particularly keen to sell any of their FA Cup-winning stars at this time. This will not be a cheap option.",
      "",
      "Xavi Simons (RB Leipzig)\nAnother high-class option where the interest is long-standing but the attentions of a London rival may render it moot. Chelsea have appeared Simons’ likeliest destination for most of the summer, and again the only real card Spurs have to play is in offering fewer existing players standing in his way.",
      "And that feels like it’s got more chance of counting for something with Eze than it does Simons. And we’re not sure it’s got that much chance with Eze.",

      "",
      "Morgan Rogers (Aston Villa)\nRogers’ name popped up briefly in connection with Spurs earlier in the summer and there’s a good chance the boat has been missed here, with any deal far more likely before the PSR deadline than after it.",
      "He also limped out of Villa’s 4-0 friendly win over Roma on Wednesday night, raising doubts about his participation in the early weeks of the season. Something that might, counter-intuitively, not be the worst news for Villa in the long-term.",
      "They remain keen to tie him down to a new contract but are surely primed to expect at least a phone call from London. One that very likely also mentions the words ‘Jacob’ and ‘Ramsey’.",
      "",
      "Kobbie Mainoo (Manchester United)\nReality bit for Mainoo in a difficult 24/25 season and there remain doubts about where he best fits into Ruben Amorim’s system at Manchester United. Is he physical enough for a role in the midfield double-pivot? Is he creative enough to be one of the two number 10s?",
      "After a summer full of talk suggesting he could be on the move, the tone has shifted. It now appears more likely he’ll remain at Old Trafford for now, but with United continuing to chuck all sorts of money at all sorts of players it does still feel like some will need recouping somewhere along the way; Mainoo could yet emerge as something of a spare part.",
      "Whether he’s exactly the sort of player Spurs need to take on such a significant creative burden in what currently looks like a team of honest plodders is less certain, but he does possess that Maddison-like ability to unlock a defence with a clever pass others might spot.",
      "",
      "Mikkel Damsgaard (Brentford)\nLook, at some point in this kind of list it is an absolute and irrefutable law that you must pose the question “Who has done this job for the manager elsewhere?”",
      "Damsgaard might not have got the same attention as your Bryan Mbeumos or Yoane Wissas at Brentford last season, but he was a key figure in their attacking efforts and reached double figures for assists.",
      "Frank obviously knows all about a player who started 34 Premier League games for the Bees last season – and came off the bench in all the other four – and he wouldn’t command the price tag of many others on this list. At 25, he’s also a potential long-term rather than stop-gap solution.",
      "But he has five years left on his contract and Brentford’s interest in losing another key figure this summer – and this late on – would, we suggest, be fairly low.",
      "",
      "Lucas Paqueta (West Ham)\nThe very idea of Spurs signing anyone from West Ham was a ludicrous one until as recently as this very summer, and we’ll cheerfully concede that when the first talk of Mohammed Kudus joining Tottenham emerged in June we immediately dismissed the idea and assumed the Hammers and/or Kudus’ camp were simply trying to smoke out interest from elsewhere.",
      "But no. With West Ham no longer quite sure about Kudus after a Difficult Second Season, Spurs came up with a sum of money sufficient to overcome the Hammers’ intrinsic unwillingness to do business with the north London mob.",
      "With Paqueta now free to resume his career after being cleared of spot-fixing charges that looked set to land him a lifetime ban, talk has instantly resumed about whether that career will indeed continue at West Ham.",
      "He had been poised to join Man City before it all kicked off, and they have been mentioned again. In a move that could take out two of the 10 options here in one swoop, there has been talk of City using Grealish as a makeweight in that deal. And you have to concede that Grealish at West Ham feels, if anything, even more correct than Grealish at Tottenham. Although that could just be the colour scheme.",
      "",
      "Mason Mount (Manchester United)\nHas been one of Manchester United’s best players in pre-season, which is admittedly a little bit like saying the bread has been one of the most appealing elements of a dogsh*t sandwich, but still.",
      "It may be that he’s done enough to convince Amorim he can turn around his MAN UNITED NIGHTMARE rather than needing the seemingly inevitable ESCAPE ROUTE from it, but we do still find ourselves wondering where exactly a player whose career has shambled down a cul-de-sac fits in at United.",
      "Whether anyone looking to resurrect a career gone backwards would be wise or keen to attempt that challenge at this iteration of Tottenham is another valid consideration.",
      "Arsenal are still planning to make moves for Real Madrid winger Rodrygo and Crystal Palace attacking midfielder Eberechi Eze, according to reports.",
      "Arsenal have been ‘offered’ the chance to sign Atalanta winger Ademola Lookman this summer as they look to sign another attacker, according to reports.",
      "According to reports, Tottenham Hotspur have picked out ‘three’ potential replacements for James Maddison and will ‘meet all’ of Liverpool’s ‘demands’.",
      "Spurs are on the lookout for some reinforcements after James Maddison was ruled out for the majority of the season.",
      "Tottenham Hotspur have been dealt a huge blow as the severity of James Maddison’s injury has been confirmed as they plot a raid on Aston Villa.",
      "With a trio of Arsenal targets occupying the top two spots, here are the top 10 attacking midfielders who are available for transfer this summer."

      "Now, the signing of RB Leipzig striker Benjamin Sesko – who scored 21 goals in all competitions last season – looks imminent to round out the attack.",
      "Once that move is complete, though finances might make it a struggle, United could look to improve the midfield. Caught Offside reports attention could be turned there, with Como midfielder Nico Paz looking ideal to add both quality and creativity to the Red Devils.",
      "After Tottenham began contact for the transfer, the report suggests United and Chelsea ‘could be next’. They state there could be a battle between the three sides for ‘one of the hottest names in European football’.",
      "Paz, in his first season with Como, scored six goals and assisted nine more in 35 games, and had his former side Real Madrid looking at him for a while before they reportedly opted against bringing him back.",
      "Paz is said to be valued around €70million (£60.6m), with it suggested there is a clause in place for him, as the report states Como would like to agree a new contract to remove those so they can cash in on him for more.",
      "Reports have suggested that Tottenham have already opened the bidding for Paz, at €40million (£34.6m) and it was said it was rejected, but those reports have been denied by Spurs sources.",
      "Though United are said to be showing strong interest, it seems it would be difficult for them to pay a big sum, given they have already parted with around £130million this summer, and another £74million will leave their account for Sesko.",
      "Chelsea too have paid big money for a lot of players this season, but they have also registered big sales, such as Noni Madueke and Joao Felix.",
      "As such, they might well be able to finance a deal for Paz, beating their Premier League rivals to the Spaniard’s signature.",
      "The report does also suggest there is a chance Real could activate their buyback clause for Paz, which is said to be much lower than what Como currently value him at.",
      "It rises by €1million each year, but will only reach €10million (£8.6m) by 2027, according to reports, so while Real are said to have left the scene for now, they might well be back at any point if Como don’t sell Paz."

      "United are moving to improve upon a 15th-placed Premier League finish last term. They have signed two quality Premier League attackers in Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha, and are closing in on RB Leipzig star striker Benjamin Sesko, who scored 21 goals in all competitions last season.",
      "Current United striker Rasmus Hojlund‘s future has been up in the air all summer, with United reported at times to be unsure whether to keep him or let him go after he struggled massively in front of goal last season.",
      "Transfer insider Romano has revealed that United have opted for something in the middle of those two options, as they have ‘definitively opened doors’ for his loan exit, but there’s a twist.",
      "Indeed, Romano suggests that Hojlund ‘insists on staying at United’.",
      "He states AC Milan are in contact with his agents to advance for the deal, with the Red Devils angling for a loan fee of €6million (£5.2m) as well as having Hojlund’s full salary covered.",
      "But there seems a chance the striker could refuse the move in order to prove himself at United. That would be hard, though, as opportunities are likely to be limited after last season’s four-goal Premier League return, and the presence of current striker Joshua Zirkzee and soon Sesko, too.",
      "United’s thoughts on Hojlund have changed recently, too, as Romano said of late: “Højlund is saying, obviously, that he wants to stay at Manchester United, he wants to fight for his place, but if Man United sign a top striker like Sesko, Højlund can still leave the club.",
      "“No one from Man United told Højlund, ‘you have to go, you have to leave,’ but obviously if a top striker like Benjamin Sesko joins Manchester United, for Højlund it could be time to go and leave the club.",
      "“Don’t forget the interest from Italy, especially from AC Milan, who are looking for a striker. At the moment, financially, it’s still considered too expensive; it’s not the only option, because Milan are also considering a move for Dusan Vlahovic.”",
      "That differs from their current stance that the door is open for the striker to leave.",
      "Following on from that, it’s been suggested that Milan’s view is they’re ready to sign Hojlund, with United happy to see him go, but there’s been no green light from him, and it looks like it will stay that way.",

      "Liverpool, Manchester United, Man City and Real Madrid have all incorporated recycled plastic into their kits but more needs to be done for sustainability.",
      "",
      "Football kits have morphed from humble cotton shirts into technological, fashion-driven apparel packed with synthetic fibres.",
      "But beneath the slick designs and vibrant club badges lies a hidden environmental cost.",
      "Most kits are made from polyester, a plastic derived from fossil fuels that is notorious for its carbon footprint, microplastic shedding and waste generation. Major brands such as Adidas, Nike and Puma have unveiled sustainability initiatives. Yet questions remain about whether these efforts meaningfully change the game or simply greenwash it.",
      "From microplastic pollution to soaring carbon emissions and textile waste, the synthetic nature of modern football kits is problematic. Washing polyester garments releases tiny plastic particles into waterways, entering the food chain.",
      "It is estimated that only about nine per cent of all plastic is ever recycled. Most persists in the environment for centuries, as microplastics break down into smaller and smaller particles. Recycling and reuse may not be an adequate solution.",
      "“Recycling is the mop,” Jacqueline Savitz of Oceana, a non-profit organisation dedicated to protecting and restoring the world’s oceans, told PBS. “We need to first turn off the faucet.”",
      "The carbon cost of virgin polyester is also high. Producing new polyester consumes significant energy, contributing to greenhouse gas emissions, while the fast turnaround of kit releases – driven by fan demand, marketing and trends – adds to the mountain of textile waste. Simply recycling used kits doesn’t address this systemic overproduction.",
      "Brand initiatives tackle some of these issues. Adidas, for example, launched the Primeblue and Primegreen programmes in collaboration with Parley for the Oceans, using recycled ocean plastic in their performance fabrics. Primeblue contains Parley Ocean Plastic, while Primegreen contains no virgin plastic. These fabrics were designed to help Adidas meet their commitment to eliminate virgin polyester use by the end of last year and reduce their carbon footprint by 30 per cent by 2030.",
      "In 2024, Adidas reported that 99 per cent of all polyester used in their products was recycled, painting a picture of early achievement of their goals.",
      "Nike’s sustainability push is centred on their “Move to Zero” campaign, which aims to reduce carbon, waste and reliance on virgin materials. Nike has produced kits composed of recycled polyester made from plastic bottles, diverting vast amounts of waste from landfill. These garments featured prominently in Liverpool’s recent kits before their switch to Adidas, aligning brand efforts with the club’s own sustainability objectives.",
      "Similarly, Puma have introduced their RE:FIBRE initiative, which recycles textile waste into new performance garments and pledges to reach 75 per cent recycled polyester use by 2025 across their products, including football kits.",
      "These efforts have influenced club policies. As well as Liverpool’s Nike kit including recycled polyester derived from plastic bottles, Manchester City’s Puma kits use materials from the RE:FIBRE program, reflecting a circular-economy approach driven by their sponsor’s sustainability targets. These partnerships are seen as aligning manufacturers’ material choices with club branding and green credentials.",

      "Fan sentiment and market forces are playing their part, too. According to a study by Sport Positive Leagues, clubs that adopted kits made from recycled materials saw a significant uptick in positive feedback, indicating growing consumer demand for eco-friendly products.",
      "But the path forward is thorny. Using recycled polyester still means reliance on plastic. While Adidas and Puma reduce dependency on virgin polyester, the end-product is still synthetic fabric. Critics note that recycled polyester may not match the performance properties of virgin polymers precisely, though most advances in fabric engineering now close that gap. Brands may also overstate sustainability claims, with limited third-party certification or product lifecycle transparency.",
      "Industry observers stress that while recycled polyester reduces waste and carbon emissions compared to virgin polyester, it perpetuates a plastic-dependent model unless broader systemic change occurs. Performance trade-offs also remain a concern at the elite level – especially in high-wicking, breathable kits designed for extreme physical exertion. Fabric rebirth may necessitate compromises.",
      "Transparency is another hurdle. Brands release sustainability milestones, but independent verification is less common. Adidas’ claim of 96 per cent recycled polyester is laudable, yet independent auditors and lifecycle assessments are limited in public view. Consumers may not know how ocean plastic was collected, where recycling processes occurred or what happens at end-of-life for the garments themselves.",
      "Ultimately, sustainability in football fashion is caught at the intersection of ecology, economics and consumer culture. Big brands have undeniably propelled recycled materials into flagship football kits, driving clubs to align with sustainability narratives.",
      "Adidas’ Parley initiative brought recycled ocean plastic into jerseys worn by Manchester United and Real Madrid, signalling symbolic and practical change. Nike’s Move to Zero and Puma’s RE:FIBRE similarly reflect an industry-wide shift towards circularity.",
      "But critics like Savitz remind us that greenwashing is a real danger without meaningful reduction in plastic production.",
      "To truly reach sustainable fashion, football apparel must embrace more than recycled synthetics. The industry needs to rethink supply chains, invest in biodegradable fibres, reduce the frequency of kit releases and provide clear transparency – from raw materials to end-of-life disposal.",
      "Clubs can leverage sponsor influence to push for real change such as longer kit cycles, reuse initiatives, buy-back programmes and circular design. Consumer education is essential, too. Fans should understand that buying a recycled kit is better than virgin plastic, but it is not a solution in itself.",
      "Until then, sustainability remains a work in progress. Brands and clubs can score goals in raising awareness and shifting materials, but the environment’s full victory depends on ending plastic dependency – not merely recycling it.",

      "Chelsea have ‘agreed every detail’ of personal terms with Man Utd winger Alejandro Garnacho ahead of a potential transfer, according to transfer expert Fabrizio Romano.",
      "The Blues have already got eight signings over the line this summer with Joao Pedro, Jamie Gittens, Jorrel Hato, Liam Delap, Estevao, Dario Essugo, Kendry Paez and Mamadou Sarr all joining.",

      "Man Utd are looking to offload the members of their ‘bomb squad’ with Garnacho, Antony, Jadon Sancho and Tyrell Malacia currently proving difficult to shift for the fees they want.",
      "Garnacho is priced at around £60m by the Red Devils, after previously asking for £70m, while Chelsea have reportedly said they won’t pay more than £30m for the Argentina international.",
      "But one thing is for sure: Garnacho wants to join Chelsea. A report on Thursday insisted that Man Utd have chosen to ‘rule out all options this summer’.",
      "READ: Mailbox: Newcastle must get over unavoidable transfer hijacks and inevitable Isak sale to ‘stupid’ Liverpool",
      "And Romano has now revealed that Garnacho has ‘agreed every detail of personal terms’ and that everything on the player’s side is ‘done’.",
      "Romano wrote on X: ‘Understand Alejandro Garnacho has agreed every detail of personal terms with Chelsea! Deal done on player side, he only wants Chelsea as revealed here since July. Talks with Man United about fee will follow soon. #CFC pursue both Garnacho and Xavi Simons, as revealed.’",

      "Amorim said: “Garnacho is a really talented boy, but sometimes things don’t work out.",
      "“You cannot explain specifically what it is. But I have the feeling that Garnacho wants a different thing with a different leadership. And I can understand that. It’s not a problem.",
      "“Sometimes you adapt to one guy, you have the connection. Other times, you want a new challenge. We try to make everything okay to all the parts, to the club, to the coach and to the players. It’s a natural thing in football.”",
      "Amorim added: “There are players that clearly show that they don’t want to be here, and that is normal. It’s not that they’re bad and I’m good, or I’m bad and they’re good.",
      "“It’s not that situation. It’s a simple situation that they want new challenges. If the market closes and they are still Manchester United players, we as a club have to treat them under the same conditions.",

      "Football finance expert Stefan Borson recently insisted that a deal for Garnacho would be a “no-brainer” for Chelsea if they could get him for £30m.",
      "Borson told Football Insider: “I think it feels like a bit of a no-brainer for £30million.",
      "“You would be hard pushed to lose money at £30million because I think he is a player whose wages are manageable right now because he’s young and he’s not had that big uplift.",
      "“I think he would get a sizeable contract at Chelsea, but I think to the point where he’s the kind of player that if you bought him for £30million and he was okay, not disastrous, but you wanted to shift him on next summer or the summer after, it feels very doable to Europe.",
      "“I do think it’s a low-risk deal. But then, if it is so low risk, then it is interesting that so far nobody has bitten. There seems to be very little interest aside from Chelsea, which is slightly surprising.",
      "“You would have thought maybe he’s a deal that’s doable for quite a few clubs that are just under the main big teams. That sort of Europa League tier of teams maybe. I guess it’s limited numbers.",
      "“France is never going to be an option outside of PSG. I guess maybe Marseille, but very few teams now in France can do any sort of major business.",
      "“So, then you’re looking at Germany. Yes, there are two or three teams in Germany that could do this deal. In Italy, it’s a bit harder, maybe two or three again.",
      "“Then Spain, he really doesn’t seem to be interesting for Barca or Real, and he’s definitely doable for Atletico, but they seem not to have moved for him, which was once touted as being a potential option.",

      "Saturday 9 August 2025 18:05, UK",
      "Manchester United have completed a £73.7m deal to sign striker Benjamin Sesko from RB Leipzig.",
      "The 22-year-old has signed a five-year contract at Old Trafford, with Man Utd set to pay an initial £66.26m (€76.5m) with £7.36m (€8.5m) in performance-related add-ons for the Slovenia international.",

      "\"From the moment that I arrived, I could feel the positive energy and family environment that the club has created. It is clearly the perfect place to reach my maximum level and fulfil all of my ambitions.\"",
      "Sesko was formally presented to Man Utd supporters on Saturday, ahead of the club's final pre-season friendly against Fiorentina.",

      "United are understood to be delighted with the deal they have struck with RB Leipzig. They did not want to get embroiled in a bidding war with Newcastle - and are paying less up front than Newcastle's improved second bid.",
      "The forward's strong desire to join Man Utd was not lost on club officials - they have consistently said they only want players who want to be part of what they are trying to build, regardless of whether they can offer Champions League football or not.",
      "Director of football Jason Wilcox has played a key role in getting Sesko's deal over the line, while director of recruitment Christopher Vivell and chief negotiator Matt Hargreaves had been in Leipzig finalising the deal.",
      "Talking about the new signing, Wilcox said: \"Benjamin possesses a rare combination of electrifying pace and the ability to physically dominate defenders, making him one of the most exceptional young talents in world football.",
      "\"We have followed Benjamin's career closely; all of our data analysis and research concluded that he has the required qualities and personality to thrive at Manchester United.",
      "\"Working under the guidance of Ruben Amorim and our excellent performance team, Benjamin is joining the perfect environment to support him to reach his world-class potential.",
      "\"The desire that all of our new signings have shown to join the club this summer highlights the appeal and stature of Manchester United as we continue to build and develop a team capable of challenging for the biggest honours.\"",
      "Manchester United have been aware of Sesko ever since he moved to Red Bull Salzburg aged 16. They've scouted him for many years and this isn't actually the first time they have tried to sign him. In the summer of 2022 - three years ago now - there was some concrete interest from Man Utd.",
      "Sesko reached an agreement to join Leipzig a year later instead. That was because he didn't feel ready to make that jump to a club in the Premier League. He has now made that big move.",
      "What makes Sesko so appealing?",

      "Read Nick Wright's feature here.",

      "Manchester United have signed Benjamin Sesko from RB Leipzig; Slovenia international striker has impressed in Germany and drawn style and stature comparisons with Manchester City's Erling Haaland",
      "Saturday 9 August 2025 18:04, UK",
      "Manchester United have beaten Newcastle to the signing of Benjamin Sesko, while Arsenal were also interested in him - so what makes the striker so appealing?",
      "Sesko scored 39 goals in 87 games for RB Leipzig after joining them from Red Bull Salzburg two years ago but what qualities will the 22-year-old bring to the Premier League?",
      "And could he really be the next Erling Haaland?",
      "Here we take a closer look at Man Utd's new £73.7m frontman...",
      "His scoring record is modest by comparison but Sesko is a rare breed of striker with a similar physical profile to Haaland. At 6ft 4in, he is exactly the same height and similarly quick.",
      "His stature allows him to play the role of a targetman, holding the ball up, bringing team-mates into play and providing an outlet for long passes, crosses and set-piece deliveries.",
      "Like Haaland, he combines those qualities with explosive pace.",
      "Last season in the Bundesliga, Sesko's top speed of 35.69 km/h put him 26th among 492 players to feature in the competition. He ranked even higher in the previous campaign, at 15th.",
      "His pace no doubt formed a significant part of his appeal to Newcastle as they face the potential prospect of having to replace Alexander Isak, though it is Manchester United who have added more explosiveness to their attack following the signing of Bryan Mbeumo from Brentford.",
      "Sesko's speed can stretch and destabilise defences. It is also a devastating weapon on the break and on transitions, something he has demonstrated throughout his time in Germany.",
      "RB Leipzig are known as one of the country's most effective counter-attacking teams - their total of 17 counter-attack goals since the start of last season is the second-highest among Bundesliga sides, behind only Eintracht Frankfurt - and Sesko has been a big part of it.",
      "His total of five fast-break goals across the last two Bundesliga seasons puts him third in the division, behind his RB Leipzig team-mate Lois Openda and former Eintracht Frankfurt forward Omar Marmoush, who have scored six each.",
      "Sesko's most recent example came during a 3-3 draw with Bayern Munich in May, when he accelerated away from Eric Dier to latch onto a Xavi Simons pass and send a superb, first-time finish past stranded goalkeeper Jonas Urbig from long range.",
      "That attack saw the ball travel from the edge of RB Leipzig's box to the back of the Bayern Munich net in a matter of seconds and it was enabled by the speed and ruthless efficiency of Sesko.",
      "It is also worth noting that it is not just in open spaces that Sesko is able to carry the ball upfield.",
      "Unusually for a player of his stature, Sesko is also an accomplished dribbler with the technical skill to beat defenders in tight spaces before accelerating towards goal.",
      "His average of 1.46 successful take-ons per 90 minutes was in fact the highest of any out-and-out striker in the Bundesliga last season, highlighting another area of strength.",
      "Sesko's scoring rate dipped slightly as RB Leipzig endured a poor campaign last term but his penchant for the spectacular remains, thanks largely to his outstanding ball-striking ability.",
      "That opening goal against Bayern Munich in May, curled around Urbig using the outside of his boot from 40 yards out, was one of four he has scored from outside the box in the Bundesliga since the start of last season. Only a handful of players have scored more.",
      "Even fewer can claim to have found the net from distance with the same level of ferocity.",
      "Sesko is able to generate astonishing power with his shots, as seen most memorably with his stunning strike against Werder Bremen in January, rifled into the top corner from 25 yards out. The ball was later revealed to have travelled at a speed of 126.43 km/h.",
      "That goal against Werder Bremen, like the one against Bayern five months later, was hit with his stronger right foot but he can muster similar power using his weaker foot too.",
      "Playing for Slovenia in a Nations League game against Sweden in September 2022, he scored a sensational, left-footed volley which drew comparisons with Marco van Basten.",
      "Sesko's willingness to shoot from improbable angles and unlikely positions can, on the flip side, be frustrating. His shot map for the last two Bundesliga seasons shows a high percentage of his shots were statistically unlikely to result in goals.",
      "It is also worth noting he has significantly overperformed relative to his expected goals at RB Leipzig, scoring 27 times in the Bundesliga from only 17.7 xG across the last two seasons. The numbers raise questions over whether his scoring rate is sustainable.",
      "At the same time, though, knowing what he is capable of, it is easy to see the logic behind his ambitious shot choices. Sesko has shown he can score from just about anywhere. His directness is another part of his appeal.",
      "Another of Sesko's biggest attributes is his prodigious leap.",
      "He was a promising basketball player in his teens and the agility honed on the court can now be seen in the way he challenges for headers and controls high balls on the pitch.",
      "Coupled with his height, it gives him an edge in the opposition box, as seen when he leapt above the outstretched hand of Eintracht Frankfurt goalkeeper Kevin Trapp to head home a rebound before Trapp could reach it during a 2-1 win in December.",
      "That goal was one of eight Sesko has scored with his head across the last two Bundesliga seasons. It is the fourth-highest total in the competition behind Harry Kane, Serhou Guirassy and Tim Kleindienst, and underlines the extent of his aerial threat.",
      "That threat is particularly pertinent to Manchester United as they aim to increase their set-piece threat. They rank as the Premier League's lowest scorers from set-pieces over the last three seasons.",
      "Sesko is not yet the finished article having only turned 22 at the end of May. Some elements of his game are still raw. His goals tend to come in bursts rather than consistently.",
      "This move to the Premier League will come with considerable pressure and high expectations but his age ensures he has plenty of room to grow and develop.",
      "There is of course an element of risk in signing Sesko ahead of a more established option. He does not boast the same prolific scoring record as Haaland when he made the move to England. Haaland had scored 86 goals in 89 games for Borussia Dortmund whereas Sesko has scored 39 goals in 87 games for RB Leipzig.",
      "But his potential is huge and the parallels in style are clear. The pair have even followed similar routes, with Sesko effectively brought in as Haaland's replacement at former club Red Bull Salzburg.",
      "It is also worth noting that, at only 22, Sesko has already amassed considerable experience, making more than 250 appearances for club and country, featuring at Champions League level, and reaching double figures for goals in five consecutive campaigns.",
      "He has done all that while avoiding any serious injury setbacks. That durability is another factor in his favour, and another source of encouragement to Manchester United.",

      "A new high altitude room with multiple bikes and rowing machines have been installed - one in which the levels of temperature, humidity and more can be altered for a group of players to train in. This room at Carrington is believed to be one of the biggest of its kind in elite sport.",
      "Then onto the pool area. Sauna and steam rooms have been improved and enlarged, with new additions as well, such as a small pool with an underwater treadmill. The treadmill can be elevated up and down to the appropriate height to aid those who need it for rehabilitating from injury.",
      "The \"flow\" of the layout Heaton mentioned made a lot more sense at this point, as you really do feel everything is one, meaningful order of facilities for these players with their gym and recovery work - this will make more sense as I go on... Probably.",
      "As we continue the tour, naturally, after the gym, we find ourselves in a long, bright hallway with the changing rooms and player services areas.",
      "However, just before you to get to the first team changing room - interestingly enough - there's a door that says 'U23'. This is seen as the 'emerging talent' dressing room - a room breaking through to the first team and giving them a taste of what it is like to be in the first team building.",
      "The likes of Chido Obi and Sekou Kone are a few names that spring to mind who could be using that room at the moment as they continue to make their mark on the first team.",
      "Into the first team changing room we go - more spacious and brighter than its predecessor - with touchscreens on each player's space to go through their routine for the day.",
      "One of the more odd facts we learned is that the changing rooms is that they include… 'smart urinals' - these help measure whether a player is dehydrated and just how much liquid they may need to get back to their ideal hydration levels.",
      "One aspect Ruben Amorim hopes his players won't see too often is the new and improved treatment room. United see this as a huge improvement to the previous edition, especially after feedback from former and current players alike.",
      "The room is more spacious while also featuring more natural light for those recovering from their injuries, with views all around Carrington.",
      "United's improved medical facilities will be warmly welcomed, especially now that they have an MRI, CT and a full body scanner in their armoury.",
      "The whole body scanner - the recent addition - can, in seven minutes, find out everything about a player's body composition.",
      "With these extra and improved facilities, United also hope players who pick up any length of injuries will be more motivated to get back to full fitness at Carrington rather than carry out their rehabilitation abroad.",
      "Super 6 are starting the season by guaranteeing a £1,000,000 winner! Play for free.",
      "As we make our way upstairs, we pass the trophies of United's past, the Premier League, the Champions League, it goes on - a reminder of the past but also the aims for the future, no matter how close or distant.",
      "We find ourselves in the new player's lounge and kitchen. On first view, it is pretty stunning. Bright and open - much look the redesigned Carrington, it is understandable why the players have been excited about this redevelopment.",
      "On one side of the lounge, there are two rooms. One is a barbershop - where players can bring in their own to get their fresh cut, a footballer's necessity!",
      "Next to that, a F1 simulator, which has gone down pretty well too.",
      "As we continue on past the open floor office spaces, we see where Amorim and his staff are based. Just down the hall from Jason Wilcox and Christopher Vivell's recruitment team. With much of Old Trafford's staff relocating to the training ground in the coming months, there is a clear message here: the club want this to be a new chapter for United with it's heart in Carrington.",
      "My personal favourite, for obvious reasons - a new press conference room! In the same building, the first team will be conducting most of their business - this slight change will make a shorter walk for Amorim to come through and answer the tough questions every week.",
      "Although United have no European football to offer this season, this new room is UEFA compliant and could, as United hope, host future Champions League news conferences rather than having to constantly switch back to Old Trafford."

      "In a game which featured a first Manchester United appearance for Bryan Mbeumo, their £71m signing from Brentford, Everton twice came from behind to claim their first point of the tournament.",
      "Bruno Fernandes' first-half penalty, following a foul by James Tarkowski on Amad Diallo, was cancelled out by Iliman Ndiaye, who finished emphatically from Idrissa Gueye's cross after Vitalii Mykolenko had robbed Manuel Ugarte.",
      "Substitute Mason Mount put Manchester United back in front when he turned and curled a superb finish beyond Jordan Pickford from Fernandes' pass, but Everton levelled again when Amad's attempted clearance struck Ayden Heaven and went into the net.",
      "The freakish own goal, which occurred as Fernandes kicked out at Ndiaye, who reacted by shoving him as both players were booked, denied Manchester United a third consecutive win at the Premier League Summer Series but they still finished as winners, a point ahead of West Ham in the four-team group.",
      "As in the previous games against West Ham and Bournemouth, there were positives for Amorim, particularly in the first half, when his side produced several slick attacks and Mbeumo combined smartly with Fernandes and fellow new signing Matheus Cunha.",
      "Mbeumo was replaced by Patrick Dorgu at half-time and the game lost its rhythm as both sides made changes in the second period, with new Everton signing Adam Aznou among those introduced.",
      "Manchester United had a late chance to win it when Mount played in Dorgu but the wing-back's diagonal shot was well saved by Pickford to round off a much-improved performance from Everton following their defeats to Bournemouth and West Ham.",
      "Bruno Fernandes said the Premier League Summer Series has helped bring Manchester United's players together but rued \"laziness\" in their performance against Everton.",
      "\"It's been important for developing how we want to play and getting the new players involved too.",

      "\"Hopefully we can get one or two players more to help with that.\"",
      "His first run in behind Everton's defence came inside the very first minute of the game. Soon afterwards, he was dropping deep to release Bruno Fernandes and launch an attack. Some time later, fans cheered as he dribbled out of danger in his own half.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo only played 45 minutes of Manchester United's 2-2 draw with Everton on Sunday but even in that short timeframe he offered plenty of evidence to show just how much he can bring to Ruben Amorim's attack following his £71m arrival from Brentford.",
      "The 25-year-old's early withdrawal showed there is work to do to build his fitness but he looked sharp, starting in an inside right position, behind Matheus Cunha, but interchanging roles with the Brazilian throughout the first half, his movement causing problems.",
      "He was involved in the build-up to the penalty, releasing Amad Diallo with an instinctive first-time pass, and went close to scoring himself, first when he tested Jordan Pickford from a free-kick, and again when he had two efforts in quick succession blocked.",
      "As became customary at Brentford, his speed and dynamism was a major feature of his performance. His forward runs provided a foil for Fernandes and there were early signs of chemistry with Amad and Cunha. All in all, this was a positive start by Manchester United's new No 19.

      "Bruno Fernandes on Man Utd's need for further additions: \"We needed more competition for the players that were here, more quality to get everyone to step up more and I think that is what the club are trying to do. Hopefully we can get one or two players more to help with that.\"",
      "Monday 4 August 2025 08:03, UK",
      "Bruno Fernandes was critical of Man Utd's \"lazy\" display in their 2-2 Premier League Summer Series draw with Everton before calling for further reinforcements in the transfer window.",
      "Fernandes' first-half penalty, following a foul by James Tarkowski on Amad Diallo, was cancelled out by Iliman Ndiaye, who finished emphatically from Idrissa Gueye's cross after Vitalii Mykolenko had robbed Manuel Ugarte.",
      "Substitute Mason Mount put Manchester United back in front when he turned and curled a superb finish beyond Jordan Pickford from Fernandes' pass, but Everton levelled again when Amad's attempted clearance struck Ayden Heaven and went into the net.",
      "The freakish own goal, which occurred as Fernandes kicked out at Ndiaye, who reacted by shoving him as both players were booked, denied Manchester United a third consecutive win at the Premier League Summer Series but they still finished as winners, a point ahead of West Ham in the four-team group.",
      "When asked about the success of Man Utd's tour to America and the display against Everton, Fernandes said: \"It's been positive. It's been positive to be together to create a bond between the players.",
      "\"It's been important for developing how we want to play and getting the new players involved too.",
      "\"We didn't want to finish in this way,\" The United skipper added. \"Our performance wasn't the best and we were a little bit lazy today.",
      "\"We want to avoid that because with laziness you can pay at any moment.\"",
      "The positives for United against Everton was a first appearance for Bryan Mbeumo, their £71m signing from Brentford.",
      "He combined smartly with Fernandes and fellow new signing Matheus Cunha on a number of occasions during the first half, showing the benefit of new additions to the squad.",
      "However, the United skipper called for more reinforcements when asked if the club was where it needed to be heading into the new season.",
      "\"It's improving,\" he said. \"But it's not the place it needs to be.",
      "\"I don't want to take a dig at anyone but the club is doing the best they can in terms of the financial situation they talk about.",
      "\"But it was crystal clear we needed more competition for the players that were here, more quality to get everyone to step up a little more to get to the XI, and I think that is what the club are trying to do.",
      "\"Hopefully we can get one or two players more to help with that.\"",
      "Asked about Fernandes's comments, manager Ruben Amorim told reporters: \"I think I'm happy for the players to have that feeling. It's saying that they understand the situation. So, it's a good feeling.",
      "\"One team can always improve with more players, but we have players to make that competition. We need to improve as a team and we have potential to improve with our players and I'm really happy with the squad.\"",
      "After a 15th-placed finish in the Premier League last season and defeat in the final of the Europa League to Tottenham, Fernandes also called on United to start to show a winning mentality again, and he challenged the players to show it on the pitch.",
      "He said: \"Every small thing matters. At this football club you cannot do anything wrong on or off the pitch because it is too big worldwide and you get punished by that.",
      "\"You get the attention of the media, the attention from the fans and you have to be aware of that.",
      "\"The culture of this club was winning. We need to bring that back.",
      "\"It's not only the winning mentality that we need but it is other things too that the club are trying to improve like the facilities, the team, the staff and a lot of other things.",
      "\"A lot of people have suffered from this and now it is time for us players to show it on the pitch.\"",
      "Amorim says Man Utd are 'better' after their pre-season tour to the USA, but adds there is still work to do once they return to Carrington.",
      "He said: \"We already knew we had two weeks and it would not change in two weeks, but we are better. Even in this game [against Everton], we created chances and that is really important.",
      "\"I think the momentum of the tour was perfect. We had the weeks to work with a good environment, good feeling, and then we go back to Carrington and we are near to start the season.",
      "\"We are going with the feeling that we need to do a lot of things [better].\"",
      "Reflecting on Mbeumo's debut, Amorim added: \"He played well. He needs to understand the position, the movement but the first touch, the way he connected with one touch, opened a lot of space.",
      "\"You can see he's not in the perfect condition physically but he makes a lot of runs and that can stretch a team so everything I was expecting, he delivered.\"",
