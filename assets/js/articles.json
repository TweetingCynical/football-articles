      "Aston Villa manager Unai Emery has picked out goalkeeper Emi Martinez for his performance, a matter of days after a potential transfer to Manchester United collapsed. The Argentine was heavily linked with a move to Old Trafford on deadline day and throughout the summer.",
      "Martinez was left out of Aston Villa's matchday squad for their Premier League clash against Crystal Palace just a day before the deadline. Emery, at the time, refused to be drawn on the reasons for making that decision.",
      "In the end, United opted to swoop for Senne Lammens ahead of Martinez - with the former joining from Belgian side Royal Antwerp. That, in turn, has allowed Andre Onana to complete a loan move to Trabzonspor.",
      "Having stayed put at Villa, Martinez was back in their starting line-up for Saturday's Premier League clash against Everton at the Hill Dickinson Stadium. The game ended in a 0-0 draw, and Martinez was widely praised for keeping a clean sheet.",
      "\"Firstly, the goalkeeper, Martinez did a fantastic job. He saved us a lot of times.\"",
      "Emery added: \"We were defending with the ball, we were being disciplined and organised. Then we've have to improve offensively, as we are not scoring goals - but with this point I am happy. We are building the team and getting confidence and getting emotions together. This point is necessary to keep going.",
      "\"Everton are performing very well. Of course, they are improving and we are building a team with circumstances that we have and recognising our positivity. Competing and feeling strong.",
      "\"We analysed the last match we played and we were not competing like we were today. Our identify today was [clear] on the field.\"",
      "Once again touching on Martinez's performance between the posts, Emery went on: \"His comeback is fantastic.\" Martinez was serenaded by the travelling Villa fans during the game. The goalkeeper was also the last Villa player down the tunnel after applauding the away support following full-time.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Unai Emery is aiming to end Jadon Sancho's England exile during the Manchester United outcast's time with Aston Villa. Sancho, 25, joined the Midlands side on a season-long loan towards the end of the transfer window.",
      "It was his third such move having been sent to both Borussia Dortmund and Chelsea over the past few campaigns. Chelsea had an obligation to buy him for £25m, but paid a £5m penalty to back out of that deal.",
      "And that has seen Sancho, yet again, look for pastures new with Aston Villa. Boss Emery already has high hopes for the winger having underlined his target to help Sancho return to England contention.",
      "Speaking during his pre-match press conference ahead of this weekend's clash with Everton, Emery said: \"Yes, of course, this is my objective, to get him back to his best - and if he does that, then he'll come back to the national team.",
      "\"Every player wants to be part of the national team. When he was in Borussia Dortmund, he performed fantastic. And he played with the national team 25 matches, more or less. Of course, he's still young.",
      "\"He's still being hungry to show his capacity to play with his skills, his qualities, and hopefully we can exploit here, again, his best.\"",
      "Sancho has 23 England caps to his name so far and scored three goals, but he's not made an appearance for the Three Lions since 2021. Current England boss Thomas Tuchel has yet to comment whether he would be willing to facilitate Sancho's return.",
      "But his predecessor as interim Lee Carsley did give an insight and claimed that regular football could, potentially, help Sancho find a way back into contention. He said: \"Jadon is a player that has huge potential who has hopefully found a home where he feels rated, he feels loved.\"",
      "He added: \"I think he just needs time now to play. I don't ever feel in a rush where a player [who] is doing well for three or four games should be in an England squad.”",
      "England were well stocked for wide options during the latest international break. Tuchel selected Eberechi Eze, Jarrod Bowen, Anthony Gordon and Marcus Rashford in the squad for World Cup qualifiers against Andorra and Serbia.",
      "England are back in action next month when they take on Wales in a friendly, and Latvia in a World Cup qualifier. And Sancho will certainly be aiming to catch the eye for Villa who are in Premier League, Carabao Cup and Europa League action before then.",

      "Sam Mather is still exploring his dwindling options to leave Manchester United after a move to Turkey collapsed.",
      "Mather came through the academy at Old Trafford, but has yet to make a senior appearance. He did travel with the first team on their pre-season tour in 2024, but has thus far failed to make the grade.",
      "The winger spent the second half of last season on loan with Tranmere and is hoping for another move to help kickstart his professional career.",
      "Kayserispor had agreed a permanent move for the youngster, with the fee, buyback clause and personal terms all given the green light. But that move will now have to wait until January, after United’s deadline was not met.",
      "He may still get his wish granted though, with BBC Sport claiming an imminent exit could still be on the cards. Serbia and Israel are the only two UEFA-registered leagues with windows open, while teams in the UAE and Qatar are still able to sign players.",
      "While Mather’s move to Turkey didn’t materialise, Andre Onana did make the switch, signing for Trabzonspor on a season-long loan deal.",
      "The error-prone keeper has fallen out of favour under Ruben Amorim, with Altay Bayindir getting the nod in the first three Premier League games of the season. And with the arrival of Senne Lammens on deadline day, Onana has been deemed surplus to requirements.",
      "Speaking about Onana’s exit, Amorim said: “You can be really experienced but in this club, the pressure is sometimes so hard on every detail.",
      "“I think we understood that this needed a change. Sometimes it's hard to point why. It's the performance, the moments. The bad luck in some moments was hard on him, was hard on us. Our thinking is to have a change in the goalkeepers.”",
      "Tyrell Malacia was also tipped to swap England for Turkey, but has remained at United - and included in their Premier League squad.",
      "The Dutch defender is the only member of United’s ‘bomb squad’ from this summer to stick with the club. Marcus Rashford, Alejandro Garnacho, Jadon Sancho and Antony all moved on, but Malacia could yet force his way back into contention.",

      "Ruben Amorim has been told he will regret starting Altay Bayindir in the Manchester Derby on Sunday because Manchester City will exploit his key weakness.",
      "Amorim confirmed on Friday that Bayindir will start in goal ahead of new signing Senne Lammens. The Manchester United manager had a choice between the Turkey international and £18.2million new arrival after Andre Onana left to join Trabzonspor on loan.",
      "He suggested that the decision had been taken more because Lammens was not ready, rather than having particular faith in Bayindir. Lammens, 23, has only played in Belgium previously and Bayindir has started all three of United’s Premier League games this season.",
      "Bayindir was at fault for Ricciardo Calafiori’s goal in Arsenal’s 1-0 win over United on the opening weekend of the season. The 27-year-old flapped at Declan Rice’s corner and former Scotland international Craig Burley thinks his weakness at dealing with balls into the box will be played on by City.",
      "“With Bayindir, every set-piece I’m putting Haaland and every centre half on him and just swinging it under the crossbar for fun,” Burley told ESPN.",
      "“Hell, if Man City have got someone who takes long throws, I’m throwing it in Rory Delap style. I’m just piling it into the box because he’s absolutely hopeless at coming out and dealing with aerial balls – he’s shown that.”",
      "Amorim chose Bayindir as his starting goalkeeper this season, with Onana coming into pre-season injured after a difficult 2024/25 campaign. He hasn’t convinced in goal and some believed the deadline-day arrival of Lammens would make him the new No.1, only for Amorim to nail his colours to the mast.",
      "“Altay is going to continue,” he said. “It is a different league, different country, different ball [for Lammens]. So they [he and Bayindir] will fight for the position. We are really pleased – he is a goalkeeper with a lot of potential.",
      "“We are in the moment that the goalkeeper needs to be really strong and have a lot of experience but we also have to look at the present with a focus on the future so it is a bit of both. He will be ready.”",
      "United won their first game of the season before the international break, beating newly-promoted Burnley 3-2. But the midfield balance is another obvious problem that Amorim is yet to address, according to Burley.",
      "“I can’t help but think, looking at Casemiro and [Bruno] Fernandes if that is the midfield two, that City have to dominate that area, they just have to,” he added. “And if they do dominate that area as I expect, then the supply line to the wide players and Erling Haaland is going to be plentiful.",
      "“I just don’t see how United are going to dominate the middle of the park. Yeah, they’ve got [Bryan] Mbeumo and some forward players that can get in behind and hurt City, but you have to have possession of the ball, and that’s been their big problem.”",

      "Sir Alex Ferguson left Owen Hargreaves feeling uneasy when he offered to make him a cup of tea. Former England international Hargreaves was signed by Ferguson for Manchester United in a £17million deal from Bayern Munich in July 2007.",
      "Speaking on That Peter Crouch Podcast, Hargreaves recalled how Gary Neville first broke the news to him that Ferguson wanted to sign him. \"So, I remember Gary was the first one to call me after the World Cup. He was like, 'Boss wants to sign you, do you want to come to Man United?' I was like, 'Yeah, if we can make it work,'\" he said.",
      "When asked about conversations with Ferguson, he added: \"Yeah, of course. Do you know what, I remember one of the coolest things was... because it's quite surreal, all those things you know? We all have a poker face, right? So you're just reading it as you go.",
      "\"I remember he said, 'Oh, do you want a cup of tea?' and I remember thinking, 'I can't let him make me a cup of tea, it feels disrespectful.' So I was trying to like get in the mix, but I didn't want to p*** him off either.",
      "\"It was cool that he had acknowledged you as a player and wanted you to be a part...See, I remember he said to me, 'You can help us win the Champions League,' and I said, 'Yeah, boss, that's why I'm here.'\"",
      "It's evident that the now 44-year-old held Ferguson in high regard before joining Manchester United, given the Scot's impressive record of nine Premier League titles, five FA Cups, two League Cups and a Champions League trophy with the Red Devils prior to Hargreaves' arrival.",
      "However, the remainder of his time in the North West was fraught with difficulties. From 2008 to 2011, Hargreaves only managed to play four more games for Manchester United due to a series of injuries, which eventually led him to join cross-town rivals Manchester City.",
      "Knee troubles kept him out of action for 573 days between 2008 and 2010, while thigh problems in 2010/11 saw him miss an additional 148 days. Despite having high expectations for his stint with the Cityzens after signing a one-year deal, he only made four appearances for the club before being released in 2012.",
      "And although City clinched the Premier League title that season, Hargreaves left without a winners' medal due to insufficient game time. Ferguson, on the other hand, continued to manage Manchester United until 2013, when David Moyes took over.",
      "Despite having a host of top-tier managers since then, including Jose Mourinho and Louis van Gaal, none have managed to replicate the golden era that the legendary Scot presided over during his 27-year tenure. Ruben Amorim is the most recent manager to take charge at Old Trafford.",
      "The 40-year-old has brought in several new faces, including Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko, and will be hoping they can provide the goal-scoring prowess his team lacked last season. But with one win, one draw and one defeat from his first three matches, Amorim will be looking for more consistency going forward when United return to Premier League action on Sunday to face City in the Manchester derby.",

      "Rene Aufhaser, a football coach who played a key role in the development of Erling Haaland and Benjamin Sesko, has boldly predicted that Manchester United's forward will match the prowess of Manchester City's goal machine.",
      "Aufhaser, who helped shape Haaland and Sesko into two of Europe's most thrilling forwards at RB Salzburg, was asked to draw a comparison between the two. Ahead of this weekend's Manchester Derby, he confidently stated that Sesko, who made the switch to the Red Devils from RB Leipzig this summer, will be as good as Haaland.",
      "Despite the 22-year-old only starting one game under Ruben Amorim - the disastrous League Cup second-round exit to Grimsby Town - Aufhaser remains confident that the United forward will realise his potential, having seen both Haaland and Sesko when they were still raw talents.",
      "\"He will develop in the next one and two years, I'm sure. Erling reached his mark after his transfer from Dortmund to Man City and we will see. I am quite sure Benji will reach this mark after one or two years. But, of course, Erling is the top. He has 10 out of 10 from me.\"",
      "This isn't the first occasion a direct parallel has been drawn between Sesko and Haaland. The promising United striker even revealed that numerous teammates have told him he surpasses the Norwegian, who has netted 88 times with 17 assists across 100 Premier League outings for City.",
      "In an earlier interview, Sesko revealed: \"Such comparisons motivate me and give me energy. They do not represent pressure. I will listen and learn, so I can be even better than he is.",
      "\"My team-mates at the club tell me that Haaland and I are very similar, especially in terms of speed. Most of them even tell me that I'm better than him!\".",
      "Sesko did backtrack on those remarks when his switch to United was confirmed. This was perhaps sensible as he has yet to make his mark in any of his three substitute appearances for United in the Premier League.",
      "Throughout his stint with RB Salzburg, FC Liefering and RB Leipzig, Sesko has found the net 100 times and provided 26 assists across 228 career outings. He also possesses 16 goals in 43 caps for Slovenia, but couldn't find the target in his country's 2-2 stalemate with Sweden and 3-0 defeat to Switzerland in the recent international break.",
      "Despite this, he still received backing from international colleague Andraz Sporar, who called for patience. He told reporters: \"What does he bring to United? Everything. He has speed, power, intelligence, good football IQ.",
      "\"I believe he can be a complete striker in the next two or three years. But he's still young. He will help Manchester United a lot, they just need to be patient. I believe he'll score the goals and every year he will be better and better.\"",

      "Jadon Sancho's value has nosedived since his move to Manchester United. The 25-year-old, who recently secured a loan switch to Aston Villa, was once hailed as one of the brightest talents in European football.",
      "This reputation convinced United to fork out a whopping £73million to lure him away from Borussia Dortmund in 2021. At that time, the fee - one of the largest in English football history - seemed justified since, just a year prior, Transfermarkt had valued Sancho, then only 19, at an impressive £113m.",
      "However, his value has plummeted ever since. Today, he's estimated to be worth around £24m - a jaw-dropping £89m decrease in just five years. A lacklustre and unproductive spell at Old Trafford is largely to blame, with Sancho struggling for form, confidence and goals.",
      "He managed to score a mere five times in all competitions during his debut season with the club - a stark contrast to the 16 and 20 goals he netted in his last two campaigns in Germany. Managerial changes certainly didn't help matters, nor did the unexpected return of Cristiano Ronaldo.",
      "Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, the man who brought Sancho to the club, was given the boot before Christmas, while Ronaldo's comeback forced a reshuffling of the attack that saw Marcus Rashford moved to the left and Sancho awkwardly slotted into an unfamiliar position on the right.",
      "Things initially looked up when Erik ten Hag joined in 2022. Sancho finished the 2022/23 season with six Premier League goals and a more pivotal role in the first team. But everything fell apart at the start of the next campaign.",
      "In September 2023, Sancho was axed from the squad to take on Arsenal, with Ten Hag openly slamming his training displays. Sancho fired back on social media, branding his boss a liar and insisting he had been turned into a \"scapegoat.\"",
      "What came next was a four-month battle. Exiled to work with the reserves, Sancho eventually landed a loan switch back to Dortmund. By that point, though, his market worth had crashed to £22m - the lowest since his breakout campaign in 2017/18.",
      "Returning to the Bundesliga, Sancho enjoyed a modest renaissance that offered glimpses of the talent United had been desperate to capture. He bagged three goals and three assists in 21 games and played a key role in Dortmund's run to the Champions League final, where they came up short against Real Madrid.",
      "His brilliant semi-final display against Paris Saint-Germain drew compliments from Ten Hag himself, who hailed it as proof of United's initial gamble on him. This period not only rebuilt some of his belief but also steadied his market worth briefly, providing a ray of light during the chaos.",
      "That hope was fleeting, though, as Sancho's 2024/25 loan to Chelsea became another tale of disappointment. Arriving on deadline day with an obligation-to-buy clause valued at around £25m, he battled for regular starts in a packed forward line under Enzo Maresca.",
      "Throughout the season, Sancho managed to net just three league goals, a far cry from his dazzling performances in the Bundesliga. Chelsea, disappointed with his output, chose to fork out a £5m termination fee rather than seal the permanent deal.",
      "Now on his third consecutive loan stint, this time at Aston Villa, Sancho's market value is a mere £24m - barely a third of what United shelled out four years ago. The Red Devils are still footing part of his wage bill, and they're hoping that a successful run at Villa Park could either pave the way for a permanent departure or reignite the possibility of him re-joining the squad.",
      "Regardless, Sancho's career trajectory serves as a stark warning about unmet potential in contemporary football, where hype and hefty price tags can easily collapse under strain.",
      "Perhaps at Villa, under the watchful eye of Unai Emery, Sancho can finally put a stop to his downward spiral, boost his worth, and remind everyone why he was once touted as one of Europe's most promising talents.",

      "Manchester United have a chance to capitalise on their momentum by grabbing a second consecutive win in their derby clash against rivals Manchester City this weekend.",
      "Ruben Amorim's men went into the international break with a hard-earned 3-2 win at home to Burnley but now face a tough test away at the Etihad - though Pep Guardiola's men have shown they have vulnerabilities too.",
      "City have lost two of their first three games this season and are under pressure going into this game, which they cannot afford to lose if they want to keep pace with the likes of Arsenal and Liverpool.",
      "United won this fixture 2-1 away from home last season - which was his second victory against Guardiola in 2024-25 - so Amorim will be fairly confident of getting a result.",
      "Amorim will certainly be under pressure if he continues to pick up poor results this season, with some pundits claiming he should be axed after guiding the team to a 15th placed finish last season.",
      "United only have one win under the Portuguese boss in 2025-26 and the club's higher-ups will be expecting him to bring in more positive results in due course.",
      "Should Amorim be sacked in the future, there would be a number of top managers linked with the role - including ex-Real Madrid boss Zinedine Zidane, who has constantly been rumoured to be a contender in recent years.",
      "But former Burnley, Southampton and QPR star Charlie Austin has offered a more left-field option and tipped his ex-Clarets boss Sean Dyche for the role. He said that Zidane would be his No 1 pick, but if he was not available he'd appoint Dyche because he would give the team \"structure\".",
      "\"I think he's got to go, if it's my decision, I'm going after Zinedine Zidane,\" he said. \"Ultimately, there are a different set of managers that you've got to be looking at, because the situation Manchester United are in, I would take Zidane but is he the right man for the job and how we see them, probably not.",
      "\"In my honest opinion, you have to look at the job Sean Dyche did at Burnley, what he did at Everton,\" Austin added. \"For me, he stabilised the club, at least he's going to put structure in there.",
      "\"Zidane is the top of the tree for me, but what the club needs now is structure because that is something they do not have. I know Manchester United fans will look at me saying, 'he said Sean Dyche', no, they need structure [and] that is a man who will come in and make the team a lot better than what we are all seeing.\"",
      "Amorim knows he won't have Onana in his squad this weekend after the Cameroonian shot-stopper was granted a loan move to Turkish outfit Trabzonspor, with no loan fee or obligation to buy included in the deal.",
      "United signed young keeper Senne Lammens on transfer deadline day and he is now expected to be the club's new No 1.",
      "Onana came under huge pressure during his time at Old Trafford after making a succession of mistakes, including a handful during the team's humiliating Carabao Cup exit to League Two side Grimsby this season.",
      "He appeared to take a swipe at United after being welcomed in by hordes of Trabzonspor fans this week, admitting he had \"never felt so much love from people around me\".",
      "\"I am very happy. I can say that I am very happy,\" Onana told local outlet 61 Saat. I am starting a new project, a new adventure for me, I am very happy to be here.",
      "\"This is a feeling that makes me so happy. I've never felt so much love from people around me.",
      "\"It's a wonderful feeling to be made to feel at home from the very first moment. I want to start working as soon as possible and reciprocate that love by making them happy on the field.\"",
      "United fans have been crying out for a change in ownership for years after being left seething over the Glazers' running of the club.",
      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe has since come in after investing around £1.3bn to give himself a minority stake in United, but he is yet to convince supporters he can bring the glory days back to Old Trafford.",
      "While the Glazers haven't been popular in Manchester, a number of American-based businessman have had success investing in football club after actors Ryan Reynolds and Rob McElhenney took Wrexham from non league to the Championship.",
      "Birmingham are also having a resurgence since NFL superstar Tom Brady took them over, helping the club return to the Championship.",
      "Golf legend Woods has been tipped to get involved in a similar football takeover by former Premier League star Matt Jansen, who played for Blackburn, urging him to invest at United.",
      "Fellow former Rovers star Brad Friedel agreed that Woods would be a great asset to United if he decided to go down the ownership route, but urged him to snub United and instead join his former club Liverpool.",
      "\"I saw Matt Jansen say he'd like Tiger Woods to take over Man United,\" the American told Mr-gamble.com. \"I would prefer he does not go to Old Trafford. But it would be brilliant for the Premier League if he did. Go to Liverpool instead, Tiger!\"",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Pep Guardiola and Ruben Amorim have both revealed they'll be missing several key stars for Sunday afternoon's Manchester derby showdown at the Etihad Stadium.",
      "United face fewer headaches, though Matheus Cunha and Mason Mount have suffered recent blows. Both players hobbled off during the thrilling 3-2 triumph over Burnley a fortnight ago, while Diogo Dalot withdrew from Portugal duty in September's break.",
      "The trio have been ruled out by Amorim for the cross-city clash. They in turn join Lisandro Martinez in Carrington's medical room at United's Carrington base.",
      "\"They are out for this game, I don't know how long it's going to take,\" Amorim stated in Friday's press conference. \"We need these guys to be a competitive team.",
      "\"We have very good players, who are eager to play, so we will be competitive on Sunday. But they are out.\"",
      "When pressed on the potential length of their absences, Amorim continued: \"I don't want to say. If you talk to Cunha outside, he will say he can play this game. They are pushing really hard.\"",
      "As for City, Guardiola appears set to be without several vital figures. However, the Catalan head coach may also welcome back a crucial trio.",
      "On the brighter side, there, Josko Gvardiol and Savinho have both resumed training lately and might therefore be involved, while Phil Foden is anticipated to be available. The September international break didn't treat Guardiola kindly, with Omar Marmoush picking up an injury while representing Egypt, just days after John Stones had to pull out from the England squad.",
      "The City boss provided updates on these two. He also confirmed other names on the injury list.",
      "\"Omar is injured. Rayan Ait-Nouri, Rayan Cherki [is injured]. The rest are fine,\" he stated on Friday.",
      "\"Stones as well is a doubt. Not a big issue, but he is a doubt for Sunday.\"",
      "When quizzed about how long Marmoush might be side-lined, Guardiola disclosed: \"We have to make the last tests. A few weeks. Before the [October] international break he will be ready.\"",
      "Players like Mateo Kovacic, Marcus Bettinelli, Kalvin Phillips and Abdukodir Khusanov have been nursing injuries recently. However, the latter duo could be fit, having been spotted in training.",

      "Erling Haaland has hit out at his Manchester City teammates for their poor start to the 2025/26 Premier League ahead of this weekend's clash with Manchester United. City have lost two of their first three games and currently sit a frustrating 13th in the top-flight standings.",
      "Last time out, they squandered a lead at Brighton to lose 2-1 after also falling to a 2-0 home defeat to Tottenham Hotspur. Pep Guardiola's side had started the season with a 4-0 thrashing of Wolves but they have not once since.",
      "After the first international break of the season, Haaland has labelled their season start as \"not good enough\". This week, City take on United in the first Manchester derby of the season and they will be looking to seek revenge for last season's defeat.",
      "\"We've lost two games in a row, it's not good enough, it's way too bad,\" he told ViaPlay. \"We need to figure it out, get back to winning ways.",

      "Alejandro Garnacho has wasted little time making an impact at Chelsea's Cobham training ground after his move from Manchester United. After signing the winger to a seven-year contract with Stamford Bridge, Blues manager Enzo Maresca didn't hesitate to put Garnacho through his paces.",
      "The Chelsea coaching staff were keen to assess the Argentinian international's fitness, so he was assigned a series of strength and conditioning tasks. Garnacho and compatriot Facundo Buonanotte, who joined the Blues on loan from Brighton on deadline day, began their regime in the gym before joining their new teammates on the pitch.",
      "Once they joined Maresca's squad, the pair were subjected to an intense running drill. In a video shared across the club's social media platforms, Garnacho appeared worn out, but team-mate Wesley Fofana offered little sympathy.",
      "\"Welcome to Chelsea Football Club,\" Fofana told his new colleague, with Garnacho responding: \"I can't move my legs now, man\". The former United winger seems to have settled well in west London, though, with his dedication and conduct not going unnoticed.",
      "Speaking to reporters at Cobham on Friday morning, Maresca commended Garnacho, hinting that he might make his debut against Brentford this weekend. The Chelsea boss said: \"He's working well. For sure he needs to work because he arrived here probably not 100 per cent fit. So he needs to work. He's working well and we'll see. But hopefully soon we can give him minutes.\"",
      "Garnacho gave an interview when he swapped Old Trafford for Stamford Bridge at the end of last month, laying out why he made the move. Speaking to the official club website, he said: \"I have a winning mentality. I have passion and a big personality.",
      "\"It's a natural fit with a club like Chelsea, which have just won the Club World Cup. Chelsea are at the top now, and it's important to fight for the club like the fans deserve. I watched the Club World Cup, and to join the world champions is special – it means we're the best team in the world!\".",
      "\"It's not common to have played a lot of games at this age, but it has helped me a lot. I'm only 21 and I have a lot of experience from these different types of games, stadiums and moments.\"",
      "Garnacho had been a key player under Ruben Amorim until he was unexpectedly benched for the Europa League final. The winger had featured in every previous knockout match in the tournament, so the choice immediately raised questions about his future.",
      "Days later, the United manager left him out of the matchday squad entirely for the Premier League season finale. Garnacho was told he could depart - and promptly sealed a £40million switch to Chelsea.",

      "Shaun Wright-Phillips has revealed that Mario Balotelli once told Manchester police he'd \"robbed a bank\" after scoring twice to help City beat United 6-1 in the derby. The Italian striker spent two-and-a-half seasons with Manchester City and was notorious for his on and off-field antics, which frequently landed him in hot water.",
      "City fans will always fondly remember Balotelli's performance in one particular derby, where reigning Premier League champions Manchester United were humiliated 6-1 at Old Trafford. Balotelli scored twice and famously lifted his shirt to reveal an undershirt that read 'Why Always Me?', a nod to the constant scrutiny he faced while playing in England.",
      "Wright-Phillips, who had two spells with City spanning seven seasons, appeared on BBC Sport's YouTube channel to discuss the upcoming derby this weekend and reminisced about his time during these intense matches.",
      "Speaking about Balotelli, Wright-Phillips said: \"He was like a 12-year-old in almost like an adult's body. Like the things he would do, you'd expect from a 12 or 13-year-old, like the fireworks in his bathroom. Like, who would think of that when you've got a garden? Why would you light fireworks in your bathroom?\"",
      "The 43-year-old recounted a hilarious incident involving Balotelli after the notorious 6-1 match, where the Italian striker found himself in hot water with the police.",
      "\"He said to me one time when he came to training, he's like, 'Shaun, you'll never guess what happened to me yesterday,'\" Wright-Phillips said.",
      "\"So he said to me, 'After the game, I decided I'm just going to drive through Alderley Edge with my roof down and sing Manchester City songs because we beat United.' And then he said he got pulled over.",
      "\"He's obviously got cash on him because he's going somewhere. Police have asked him why he's got cash. He's turned around, he said to me, 'I told them I robbed the bank.",
      "\"I was just like, 'Why would you like think of that?' That's just his personality. Like he said, it's just his character. I bet some player he could've been, and some player he was at the time.\"",
      "Balotelli spent almost three seasons with City, scoring 30 goals and providing six assists in 80 appearances for the club. His time in Manchester was marred by injuries and suspensions, as the young forward also struggled to keep his on-pitch antics in check.",
      "Throughout his entire City career, the now-35 year old was yellow carded 21 times, two of which led to second offences and a sending off, and two straight red cards as well.",
      "Despite his notorious behaviour, Balotelli will forever be etched in memory for his legendary celebration during the once uncommon City victory in the Manchester derby. Regrettably for United, Pep Guardiola's squad now frequently secure the three points in this fierce game.",
      "But now, Ruben Amorim is planning to carry forward the momentum from United's 3-2 triumph over Burnley prior to this month's international break, as the two long-standing rivals prepare to clash once more at the Etihad Stadium on Sunday.",

      "Wayne Rooney opened up on the footballing advice he's handed his children as his eldest son, Kai, deals with injury. The 15-year-old, who is a Manchester United youth player, has followed in his father's footsteps by turning out for the Red Devils and recently earned promotion to the club's Under-19s squad, demonstrating the potential he possesses.",
      "However, the teenager's momentum - which saw him score a left-foot volley for the Under-18s - has been halted in cruel fashion after he took to Instagram to upload a mirror selfie that showed him on crutches whilst wearing a protective boot on his right foot.",
      "Kai, 15, captioned the photo writing: \"Life can't get worse,\" adding a crying emoji alongside the brief message, suggesting he's suffered an injury while playing for United's academy. While the nature of the injury or the length of his absence has yet to confirmed, it remains to be seen when the youngster can expect to return to action.",
      "It was in 2020 when he first joined the United youth set-up at 11 years old, and while he usually plays centrally, similar to Rooney Sr, he's shown versatility in his performances on the flanks.",
      "On top of the coaching he's received at United, he does possess a person at home with a wealth of knowledge of the game – his father. It was during Friday's edition of The Wayne Rooney Show that the 39-year-old delved into the guidance he'd give his sons when it comes to improving their footballing skills.",
      "\"I'm quite lucky where I live as I've got a little pitch there and when the kids say, 'we're coming on the pitch', all they're gonna do is tie the balls on the top corner,\" he said to Shaun Wright-Phillips, Kelly Somers and Kae Kurd.",
      "\"So when I say to them when I was younger, I remember setting a little square to practice passing into it and just playing off the wall. So I'm very similar, [I tell them] 'you need to work on your speed, you need to work on your technique and control.' Otherwise, you go out and you're just like, 'watch me hit the ball in the top corner'.\"",
      "Despite having handed words of wisdom to his children over the years when it comes to football matters, the former England captain admitted he's a proponent of allowing Kai to find his feet in the sport without constant advice from himself.",
      "Speaking with BBC Sport during the Super Cup NI tournament in Northern Ireland, Rooney said: \"I just let him play. I think they started the competition well, they won 3-0, he scored the penalty and got an assist.",
      "\"So I think he started OK. He just plays and that's all he's done during his time playing. I think it's very unfair for anyone to expect him to go and do all kinds. He's just playing, he's a 15-year-old boy playing his football, enjoying it.",
      "\"Of course he gets different attention to a lot of his team-mates but I think he handles that really well.\" After leaving Plymouth Argyle last year following just 25 games in charge, Rooney has yet to return to management.",

      "“Sometimes you as a club you try to see different options. We have an option [in Lammens] who can give us different things in this moment, but who also has a great potential to be our goalkeeper for a number of years.",
      "\"Andre had a very good season and the quality is there, but in the club sometimes things are getting harder and harder and at this club the pressure is so hard in every detail, so sometimes you need a change.",

We need those guys to be a very competitive team, but we have very good players who are eager to play I don’t want to say [how long they will be out for]. If you talk with Cunha, he will say he can play this game, so I don’t know. We'll manage day by day.”",

      "Ruben Amorim has confirmed that new signing Senne Lammens WON'T start the Manchester derby, instead preferring Altay Bayindir. But three Manchester United stars will miss the game through injury.",
      "Lammens, 23, was signed from Royal Antwerp on transfer deadline day, with the Red Devils agreeing to pay an initial £18.2million plus £3.5m in add-ons for the Belgian goalkeeper. A debate quickly ensued regarding who'd get the nod in goal when United take on bitter rivals Manchester City at the Etihad on Sunday.",
      "But Amorim has cleared up the speculation more than 48 hours before kick-off. \"It's the same thing I do with different positions, but Altay is going to continue,\" the Red Devils boss said at his pre-match press conference.",
      "\"I believe in Altay he is ready to play. It's a different league, a different country, a different ball. So they will fight for the position. We are really pleased [with Lammens]. He is a goalkeeper with a lot of potential.",
      "\"We are in a moment where the goalkeeper needs to be really strong and have a lot of experience, but we also have to look at the present, with a focus on the future, so it's a bit of both. He will be ready.",
      "\"Sometimes you as a club you try to see different options. We have an option [in Lammens] who can give us different things in this moment, but who also has a great potential to be our goalkeeper for a number of years.\"",
      "Turkey international Bayindir started all three of United's Premier League games before the international break, regularly looking suspect. That was after the 27-year-old was promoted to first-choice goalkeeper by Amorim, dislodging Andre Onana, who's now joined Trabzonspor on loan.",
      "\"Andre had a very good season and the quality is there, but in the club sometimes things are getting harder and harder and at this club the pressure is so hard in every detail, so sometimes you need a change,\" the United manager explained.",
      "\"I think we - and Andre - understood that this needed a change and sometimes it's hard to point out why. Sometimes it's the moment, the bad luck in some moments, it's hard on him and on us.",
      "\"Our thinking was to have a change in the goalkeepers but I wish the best for Andre, he was really good, working and trying to help the players, but sometimes you can have all the quality in the world but you need a change.\"",
      "Lammens is expected to be on the bench come Sunday, unlike three of his new team-mates. Amorim confirmed that Diogo Dalot, Mason Mount and Matheus Cunha will all be unavailable due to injury.",
      "Mount and Cunha were both taken off during United's last game before the international break, a dramatic 3-2 win against Burnley. Dalot, meanwhile, left the Portugal camp early after suffering an injury.",
      "\"I think they are out for this game,\" Amorim revealed. \"I don't know how long it is going to take. We need those players to be a very, very competitive team, but we have very good players that are eager to play so we will be competitive on Sunday, but they are out, they cannot help us in this game.",
      "\"I don't want to say [how long they will be out]. If you talk with Cunha, if you catch Cunha outside, he will say he can play this game! So I don't know. We will manage day by day, but they are pushing hard and that is a good thing.\"",

      "Ex-Manchester United star Morgan Schneiderlin looks to have had a seamless transition in his post-football career. The Frenchman, 35, enjoyed a 19-year career that saw him represent the likes of Southampton, Everton and the Red Devils in the Premier League.",
      "After beginning his professional career with boyhood club Strasbourg, it was in 2008 that the midfielder swapped the side for the Saints and went on to stay on the south coast for the next seven years.",
      "His consistent performances in the English top-flight caught the eye of the Premier League's elite, which saw him sign for the Red Devils in a £24million transfer in 2015. With the career-defining move came a significant bump in pay as he was awarded a whopping £100,000-a-week contract.",
      "Despite the staggering numbers of his new deal, that didn't stop his wife, Camille Sold, from contributing financially in their relationship. Upon their arrival in Manchester, the couple resided at the five-star Lowry Hotel, with Camille spending her days manning the till and helping customers on the shop floor of the Adidas store in the city centre.",
      "The pair have been together for over a decade, with their romance first being sparked in early 2015. It was in 2016 when Schneiderlin proposed to the former shop assistant during a holiday to the French Riviera before later marrying her the following year.",
      "The Frenchman, who retired from football in 2024, left England in 2020 after a three-year stint at Goodison Park. He went on to play for the likes of Nice, Western Sydney Wanderers, Konyaspor and A.E. Kifisia.",
      "Since calling time on his career, Schneiderlin, as per his Instagram bio, is in the process of completing his UEFA A license, the highest practical coaching award available. He's also ventured into media as a pundit for Canal+ Sport.",
      "His sporting endeavours have not vanished completely as he's become a keen runner alongside his wife and recently completed his first marathon in April at the Paris Marathon. While Schneiderlin went on to experience life in three different countries after departing United, he later admitted that he ended his stay in Manchester prematurely.",
      "\"I learned a lot from my departure from Manchester United,\" the now 35-year-old told L’Equipe in 2022. \"I had played 40 matches the previous season with Manchester. When I come back from the Euros, I take 10 days off and I play very little for three, four months.",
      "\"Then, I have Ronald Koeman and Everton who are pushing hard to get me, every day, from October. I will remember it all my life: I should have played against Liverpool, starter, and the coach (Mourinho) comes to see me.",
      "\"He tells me he doesn’t feel me inside the group. I tell him that indeed, with what has happened in the last three months, I am not in it and I want to go to Everton. I regretted it very quickly.",
      "\"Even if it went very well at Everton, when you play for Manchester United, when you’re at a club like that, it’s not for a moment of doubt that you have to question everything. Look at Ander Herrera: the first year I arrived, he was on the bench; he persevered, and today he is at PSG.\"",

      "Edinson Cavani provided Rafa Cotelo with vital funds when his daughter needed emergency surgery. The former Manchester United striker's friendship with the TV presenter is well documented in their native Uruguay, as is Cotelo's relationship with other stars like Luis Suarez.",
      "And Cavani's true colours shone through for all to see when he ensured that Cotelo's daughter, Emma, received the money for surgery required as a result of being born with hydrocephalus. Described by the NHS as \"a build-up of fluid in the brain,\" hydrocephalus can cause brain damage and even become fatal if left untreated.",
      "During a lengthy boat trip to Buenos Aires, Emma's condition began to worsen by the minute before she was taken to a clinic to be assessed by an assistant neurosurgeon. There, Cotelo was told that his daughter needed immediate surgery.",
      "As Emma was rushed into the operating theatre, Cotelo headed to pay for the operation, only to be hit with a major obstacle. The clinic performing the procedure demanded that the journalist pay in cash, despite him offering to make a bank transfer or to pay by card.",
      "Speaking about the heartbreaking encounter, he told Radio La Red: \"I had brought enough cash for a routine consultation, but as she required further treatment, the costs skyrocketed,\" adding that he was forced to turn to Cavani for help, given he was living in Argentina while playing for Boca Juniors.",
      "He added: \"Desperate, I called him, but he didn't answer. He was asleep. I had his wife's number, who is lovely, so I called her and woke her up. I explained the situation and apologised profusely.",
      "\"She put me through to Edi and he said, 'I happen to have that amount in cash, I'll be right over.' Five minutes later, he called me back, saying he'd set the GPS and was an hour away. 'I have a friend 10 minutes away, he'll take the money to you.'",
      "\"I got out with Emma's mum, freezing cold and scared, and in the dark a skinny guy appeared with a bag full of Argentinean money and said to me, 'Edi sent me, this is for you; if you need more, let me know.' It brought me back to life.",
      "\"He was like an angel to me, standing on the street, with a box full of money that Edi had sent me. I paid with that, it was enough, and the operation was carried out.\"",
      "Thankfully, Emma's operation ran smoothly, and today, Cotelo describes his daughter as: \"beautiful and happy, concerned only about her 15th birthday,\" largely thanks to Cavani's act of kindness. He also explained that after the story of the heroic feat went viral, he apologised to the player for making it public.",
      "He also ensured that his daughter handed the money back to Cavani personally, despite never asking for it to be returned. He added: \"He never mentioned it, but luckily I was able to give it back to him.",
      "\"It was my concern, and he said to me, 'What are you talking about? The important thing is that Emma is well.' The nicest thing was that Emma gave it back to him 15 days later, when we were discharged.\"",
      "In an interesting turn of events, Cavani's friend who gave Cotelo the money on the evening of the operation raised the funds from a tango bar he owns, with the presenter explaining how he emptied the till after a shift and took all the money he had to ensure that Emma could have her operation in an act of selflessness.",
      "After impressing with the likes of Danubio, Palermo, Napoli and Paris Saint-Germain, Cavani made the move to Manchester United in 2020 under the tutelage of Ole Gunnar Solskjaer. There, he scored 19 goals in 59 games before transferring to Valencia.",
      "Following a season under the Spanish sun, Cavani signed for Boca Juniors in 2023, where he has remained since. At the age of 38, Cavani is still proving his worth in the Torneo Clausura, with a goal to his name from six outings for the Buenos Aires-based side.",

      "Premier League icon Brad Friedel has tipped Tiger Woods to be a roaring success if he were to invest in a club like Manchester United. However, he'd preferably like to see the golf great end up at another English giant instead.",
      "The modern age has given way to a number of high-profile athletes and celebrities getting involved in the ownership of British clubs. NFL legends Tom Brady and JJ Watt have succeeded since buying stakes in Birmingham City and Burnley, respectively, while Wrexham have soared up the ranks under the reign of Hollywood actors Ryan Reynolds and Rob McElhenney.",
      "This transformation in the ownership landscape sparked comments from former Premier League star Matt Jansen, who tipped a figure like Woods to be a success if he made a similar investment. And former Liverpool goalkeeper Friedel, who is also a self-confessed fan of the club, agreed it would be a coup for any top club to attract such a name.",
      "\"I saw Matt Jansen say he'd like Tiger Woods to take over Man United,\" the American told Mr-gamble.com. \"I would prefer he does not go to Old Trafford. But it would be brilliant for the Premier League if he did. Go to Liverpool instead, Tiger!\"",
      "Despite the initial excitement surrounding Sir Jim Ratcliffe's minority takeover of United, fortunes on the pitch are yet to have been transformed under the British billionaire's regime. In fact, the Red Devils have registered their two lowest Premier League finishes since he started running the club's affairs in early 2024.",
      "It was back in August of this year that three-time Blackburn Player of the Season Jansen, who was once targeted by United, spoke glowingly of the new investment model in British football. And he brought up names like Woods and NBA Hall of Famer Michael Jordan as two examples of generational stars who could make an impact with the elite.",
      "\"I think Tom Brady is a good one,\" he recently told BettingLounge.co.uk. \"Maybe Michael Jordan or Tiger Woods, people who’ve been at the top of their sport, the No. 1 in their sport, will always be impressive and can relate a little bit more to football than the music industry.",
      "\"It could be any club, couldn’t it? But the likes of Michael Jordan and Tiger Woods would probably be looking at Liverpool, Chelsea or Man United, those kinds of clubs. They’re that big a star. So is Tom Brady, but Birmingham are really putting their money where their mouth is. I think they'll be a force this season.",
      "\"They could target clubs in the EFL. Look at what Wrexham started and they've been a success. It'll be other people putting it to the likes of Michael Jordan or Tiger Woods, rather than them approaching clubs.\"",
      "Jansen went on to note the discontent currently surrounding Ratcliffe's running of the Red Devils. And while Woods may not be a learned mind in the world of football, he believes the 15-time major champion's \"aura could bring success.\"",
      "Woods' move to Old Trafford could be a match made in heaven, though Jansen also teased the idea of him staging a takeover at Lancashire rivals Blackburn. As Jansen noted, Rovers are \"in a bit of a mess\" with incumbent owners Venky's and could welcome the financial influence of a sporting magnate.",

      "Roy Keane has slammed the Football Association of Ireland, claiming they \"couldn't organise a p*** up in a brewery\" following dismal World Cup qualifying performances. The Manchester United icon hinted at his interest in managing his country after discussions, but appears to have ruled out that prospect.",
      "Keane earned 67 caps for Ireland between 1991 and 2005, experiencing a stormy international career that included the infamous Saipan controversy. He subsequently worked alongside Martin O'Neill as assistant manager with the national team for five years until 2018.",
      "Discussions between the 54-year-old and the FAI emerged last year, with Keane acknowledging he harboured ambitions to return to international management. However, following two disappointing World Cup qualifying clashes, his stance appears to have shifted considerably.",
      "\"They're up against it,\" said Keane, speaking on the Stick to Football podcast this week. \"I don't think the players are playing enough at the higher level for the bigger clubs. It's been tough on the manager. Physically, they're not great. My goodness.\"",
      "Asked by former team-mate Gary Neville if he has spoken to the FAI about becoming manager, Keane replied: \"Yeah, I spoke to them, of course. But I think they spoke to everybody.",
      "\"The reason you might take the job is that you think you could help the team. They might lack quality. Try to get them organised with a bit of fight and a bit of spirit.",
      "\"[But] it's a farce. The amount of people who have come up in the last six months saying they were offered a job or they've spoken to them. That's the FAI for you, they couldn't organise a p*** up in a brewery,\" he added.",
      "\"You look at the manager, and you fear for him. He's up against it. To lose to Armenia and be well beaten is a sore one. They've had some tough results over the last few years.\"",
      "This signals a significant shift from Keane's attitude last year, when he made it quite clear that taking the Ireland job could be on his agenda. Such a stark change comes on the back of poor Irish results under boss Heimir Hallgrímsson.",
      "They suffered a 2-1 defeat to Armenia this week after previously managing just a 2-2 stalemate with Hungary. This leaves them at the bottom of UEFA World Cup qualification Group F and facing an uphill battle, with leaders Portugal still to come.",
      "\"I did enjoy the international set-up when I was working with Martin as a coach. I like the dynamics, the flow of international football,\" Keane revealed on the same podcast in 2024.",
      "\"It wasn't 24 hours a day, but you're still working at a good level, so if you're on about dream jobs, I suppose - it's a bit silly saying it, but maybe the Irish job.",
      "\"But obviously, I think that ship has sailed as well. The only thing I have inside me is - I know I'm going back a long time, and obviously I worked with Martin for a while with Ireland - I do think I could do a good job.",
      "\"Maybe it's a bit of ego, I don't know. Maybe that will never leave me. But also, if I didn't go back into management, I'm fine with that. I've a great life. I've never been so contented in my life, so be careful what you wish for.",
      "\"I still have a feeling I could do something. Maybe that will never leave me. That's not a bad thing. But also, I'm very comfortable with what I'm doing.\"",

      "Ruben Amorim has already confirmed Altay Bayindir will start for Manchester United against Manchester City.",
      "Explaining the decision at his press conference on Friday, Amorim said: \"It is the same thing I do with different positions, but Altay is going to continue. It is a different league, different country, different training, different ball [for Senne Lammens]. So they will fight for the position.\"",
      "United completed the signing of Lammens for £18.2million, plus add-ons, on deadline day, and Andre Onana was subsequently shipped out on a season-long loan to Trabzonspor.",
      "When Lammens' transfer was announced, United sources noted the goalkeeper had one of the highest goals prevented metrics in Europe and made the most progressive passes of any goalkeeper under the age of 23.",
      "Lammens was a data-driven signing and the numbers suggest he possesses the potential to be a future star, but Amorim has decided to persist with Bayindir for the Manchester derby.",
      "The 3,000 United fans in the away section at the Etihad may spend much of the game watching through their fingers. It's rarely a comfortable watch when Bayindir attempts to deal with set-pieces.",
      "Bayindir flapped at a corner against Arsenal, he nearly cost United the win against Burnley and he was fortunate not to concede from a set-piece against Fulham at Craven Cottage.",
      "It would be an understatement to say Bayindir struggles to deal with aerial balls. And City know Bayindir is starting on Sunday afternoon, so they will target him from set-pieces.",
      "Thankfully, City only scored seven Premier League goals from set-pieces last season, a record which ranks among the worst in the top flight, but Bayindir will definitely be targeted when deliveries are played into the box.",
      "The selection of Bayindir could backfire, but the goalkeeper selection for the derby was never going to be straightforward for Amorim. There are pros and cons for all of his options.",
      "There is logic in starting Bayindir, despite his poor performances in the opening few weeks of the season, because he has started the campaign as first choice and so has match practice in the Premier League under his belt.",
      "Bayindir's distribution is sometimes iffy, but it can be a strength on a good day. It would also be a risk to throw the untested Lammens into one of the biggest games of the season on his debut.",
      "It would be damaging for Lammens to make a mistake on his debut in the derby. On the other hand, there is no better fixture than the derby for a new United signing to deliver a strong performance.",
      "Lammens won't get that opportunity, so it's a moot point, and all eyes will be on Bayindir.",
      "Speaking about Lammens, Amorim said: \"He is a goalkeeper with a lot of potential. We are in the moment that the goalkeeper needs to be really strong and have a lot of experience, but we also have to look at the present with a focus on the future so it is a bit of both. He will be ready.\"",
      "The uncertainty around United's goalkeepers is not helpful, but the situation was bound to continue when United pushed to sign an inexperienced goalkeeper over Emiliano Martinez.",
      "Although Martinez was an imperfect solution, he wouldn't be starting on the bench this weekend if he had signed from Aston Villa. Lammens needs time to adapt to his new environment and is a long-term project.",
      "City also signed a goalkeeper on deadline day, signing Gianluigi Donnarumma for £26m from Paris Saint-Germain.",
      "It would be a surprise to see Donnarumma on the bench and James Trafford in the team at the Etihad, as Donnarumma has enough experience at the top level to play immediately.",
      "City signed a proven goalkeeper and United signed a goalkeeper with potential. Donnarumma will likely be given the chance to help his side claim a win in the Manchester derby, but Lammens will have to watch on.",

      "Sunday's Manchester derby will mark the 4,326th United first team match with a homegrown player in their squad. Before Ruben Amorim sat down at Carrington on Friday, it was forgivable to think the sequence was under more threat than his position.",
      "\"I don't want to be the guy that broke that record,\" Amorim stressed. \"If you see the past of Manchester United, it's built on kids that grew up here and stayed here for a long time. I think that should be our goal in the future. So I will try to maintain that.\"",
      "In the 25-man senior squad Amorim has assembled, there are now only four academy members. The 39-year-old Tom Heaton has not played since February 2023, Tyler Fredricson may not play for United again after his first half horror show at Grimsby Town, Chido Obi has not had a kick this season and Kobbie Mainoo last started a Premier League match in May.",
      "Mainoo missed four months of last season through injury. In the hypothetical scenario that every United player bar Mainoo is available for a match, Amorim could feasibly pick a 20-man squad of Bayindir, Lammens, Dalot, Mazraoui, Yoro, De Ligt, Maguire, Martinez, Heaven, Shaw, Dorgu, Fernandes, Casemiro, Ugarte, Mount, Amad, Cunha, Mbeumo, Zirkzee and Sesko.",
      "Heaven and Diego Leon, though teenagers, do not qualify as academy members. It was a grey area when Louis van Gaal's debutants were totted up. Reece James and Regan Poole did not qualify as they never played in the youth team.",
      "Amorim has put two 'keepers on the bench before, as Erik ten Hag occasionally used to. It would be a cop-out if the only academy representative in a United matchday squad is Heaton, who turns 40 in April.",
      "United have won only three of the past 11 Manchester derbies and two were decided by academy products. With Matheus Cunha and Mason Mount injured for Sunday's derby, Mainoo is in line for a recall.",
      "Since the Busby Babes, there has always been an academy poster boy through the decades. United's top five appearance makers - Ryan Giggs, Sir Bobby Charlton, Bill Foulkes, Paul Scholes and Gary Neville - are graduates. George Best is 15th in the list. Sammy McIlroy and Arthur Albiston are in the top 25.",
      "Every United manager post-Ferguson has had an academy legacy: David Moyes's was Adnan Januzaj, Marcus Rashford and Jesse Lingard came under Louis van Gaal, Jose Mourinho saw something in Scott McTominay, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer championed Mason Greenwood, Ralf Rangnick brought Anthony Elanga in from the cold while Erik ten Hag had Mainoo and Alejandro Garnacho.",
      "Concern was briefly voiced that United's academy run, which dates back to October 1937, could be jeopardised by Van Gaal amid the Van Gaalactico summer of 2014 when Angel di Maria and Radamel Falcao were headline signings. Van Gaal ended up doling out 12 debutants to academy members, ranging from Saidy Janko to Rashford.",
      "Solskjaer trumped Van Gaal, affording names as obscure as D'Mani Mellor and Will Fish a chance. There were six academy debutants against Kazakhstani side Astana alone. After Solskjaer left, United sources were dismissive of his penchant for granting debuts to talents with little or no chance of breaking into the first team squad.",
      "Mourinho and Ten Hag were more selective, though the latter unfathomably promoted Omari Forson to the starting XI for the home defeat to Fulham in February 2024. Rangnick was also particular and championed Elanga, Garnacho, Hannibal Mejbri and Alvaro Carreras.",
      "It was sobering to hear Dan Ashworth opine that the era of the one-club player was effectively over a year ago. Ashworth, two months into his brief tenure as United's sporting director, was philosophically addressing the departure of McTominay, a sale that has become more contentious since he won the Scudetto with Napoli, was named Serie A's MVP and nominated for the Ballon d'Or.",
      "The former United executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward was dismayed that the club had only two Ballon d'Or nominees in 2013 (Robin van Persie and Wayne Rooney). They did have two Golden Boy nominees last year: Mainoo and Garnacho.",
      "Garnacho is gone and Mainoo was intent on going before United blocked him last month. He has started in a derisory 16 of Amorim's 46 matches in charge but a recall is in the offing against City.",
      "Three of the debutants under Amorim have come from the academy: Obi, Fredricson and Harry Amass. Amass did not train with the first team at all in pre-season and eventually joined Sheffield Wednesday on loan last Monday.",
      "With Noussair Mazraoui fit again, Fredricson is back in the stands. Obi, not 18 until late November, is having to bide his time in the under 21s, for whom he has scored two goals in two starts.",
      "Obi removed United from his Instagram bio last month. He has since restored it and he is not the first teenage footballer to act in a puerile manner. United have two strikers they invested more than £100million ahead of him and Obi has not set the world alight in his eight senior appearances. He has to bide his time.",
      "\"We all know there's probably only two or three strikers in the world who get two goals in every three games,\" the under 21 coach Travis Binnion told the MEN. \"If you're used to scoring two goals in every game, then recognising what the role is, how you have to go around it takes a little bit of time. He is dying to be a footballer.",
      "\"He is hungry. And he's still learning the game, learning how to project himself and learning how to play within a team, the club's shape and system, so there's still lots for him to do.",
      "\"The key is he wants to play, he wants to do well and wants to train. He could train every day if he could.\"",
      "United are undergoing a change of identity. Vital academy products have become sellable assets (McTominay's last start was in the 2024 FA Cup final) as they strive to comply with the Premier League's profitability and sustainability rules. A club famed for their wing play does not use conventional wingers as they dance to the tune of Amorim's 3-4-2-1 and there will be a new Old Trafford in the 2030s.",
      "Eleven academy talents were included in Amorim's maiden pre-season squad but he is not one for gimmes. Dermot Mee, Will Murdock, Jack Fletcher and Reece Munro did not get a kick in the United States. Murdock enjoyed his work experience as Andre Onana was unfit.",
      "Bendito Mantato returned to the glamour of a mid-August friendly at Tamworth. Ethan Williams, a scorer in Chicago, came back down to earth on these shores with a Monday night at Middlesbrough.",
      "In a season where United could have as few as 40 fixtures, that first team ceiling could be impregnable for academy members. At least one will always be on the teamsheet, though.",

      "City vs United continues to be a blockbuster Premier League fixture and the fallout from the contest will be significant, irrespective of who comes out on top.",
      "But, as the players leave the field at the Etihad Stadium, there will be a piece of the Manchester derby playing out more than 2,000 miles away.",
      "Istanbul will be the setting for two debuts that will attract the attention of United and City fans.",
      "Fenerbahce vs Trabzonspor might not be the first fixture football fans in this country look up but this weekend's clash in the Turkish Super Lig will garner extra attention due to the likely debuts of goalkeepers Ederson and Andre Onana.",
      "Both departed Manchester this month with Ederson signing for Fenerbahce on a permanent deal and Onana agreeing a loan switch to Trabzonspor. The latter has been jettisoned by Ruben Amorim while Ederson's glittering City career has ended perhaps a year earlier than most predicted with James Trafford and Gianluigi Donnarumma now in situ at the Etihad.",
      "It is the dawn of a new era for Ederson and Onana, and both will be hoping for a winning start and an error-free debut.",
      "Onana's time at Old Trafford has been characterised by glaring mistakes while Ederson will want to hit the ground running for a side that expects to challenge for the title.",
      "The pair faced off five times in Manchester derbies - Stefan Ortega started for City in the FA Cup final which United won. The most recent was April's stalemate at Old Trafford, and you'd have got long odds on both being out of the picture just five months later.",
      "On a day where their Manchester allegiances meet at the Etihad, Ederson and Onana will come up against each other once again.",

      "Manchester United midfielder Bruno Fernandes was asked what critics get wrong about him and responded: \"Nothing.\"",
      "Fernandes is regarded as the best signing of the post-Sir Alex Ferguson era. The United captain has produced remarkably consistent performances since signing from Sporting Lisbon in January 2020.",
      "The Portugal international won the Sir Matt Busby Player of the Year award for a fourth time last season, joining David de Gea and Cristiano Ronaldo as the only other players to have won the award four times.",
      "Fernandes attracted interest from Saudi Arabian club Al-Hilal in the summer transfer window, but he turned down a lucrative offer to remain in the Premier League.",
      "The United captain is hoping to lead his team to victory against Manchester City this weekend. Speaking ahead of the Manchester derby, Fernandes gave a candid interview to BBC Sport where he was asked: \"What is one thing people get wrong about you?\"",
      "Fernandes responded: \"Nothing. People have an opinion about me and I can't change that. That's the way people want to judge you about what they see on the pitch or the television or interviews.",
      "\"I can't change that. They have the freedom to think the way they want about me, as I have the freedom to think about them. I don't judge people until I know them.",
      "\"They can have an opinion about me, that's fine - we all have an opinion, and that's why life is so good and so different. If we all think the same way it would be so boring.\"",
      "Fernandes was asked what he believed to be the toughest part of football, replying: \"Being consistent, I think. During 90 minutes, you have to be so consistent in everything you do,\" he said.",
      "\"Sometimes it slips away from you and it can change everything. So I think consistency in the first thing - consistent in doing whatever you think is the best for the team, because that has to come first of everything and you can't do anything without thinking of the team first.",
      "\"That's true in football, and it's what has to come above everything because there's nothing more important than the team. And then it comes to yourself to put yourself in the best position to help the team.",
      "\"And when I'm on the pitch, that's the thing that I have most in my head - to do my things will help the team to become better so I have to. I have to be the most consistent and accurate player I can be in any moment of the game, not with the ball, but also without the ball.",
      "\"But also in some things that you have to say to your teammates when you want to change something position-wise, changing set-pieces as to be accurate because if little things change, it can go against you.\"",
      "When asked whether he gets nervous in games, Fernandes said: \"No, never. During the games? No. Before the games I can get nervous. During the game I just think about the goal we have for the game, which is to win.",
      "\"I remember every step that we have trained and that my teammates have to do and I remember every position they have to do.",
      "\"When I go to a training session I focus not only on what I have to do but what is around me because it can change, I have to play a different position or a teammate could not be aware of where he has to be or which position he should stay.",
      "\"On set-pieces, I know exactly where everyone has to be. The only nervous thing is getting everything into my memory so I can remember in the game every step.",
      "\"Also, when I'm on the ball I know every movement my teammates have to do. To be aware of, 'I'm on the ball here so this is what we trained' - but you have to think that in a split second.",
      "\"It gets automatic because I think about that during the week until the game. When you think so many times about something your muscle memory works by itself.\"",

      "It all added up to farcical scenes and prompted anger from both clubs, with Guardiola in particular not holding back.",

      "“We came to play two friendly games so I think it was the first time a game has been cancelled here. They are looking for hotels, inviting players, but at the end, if the pitch is not good enough, all that doesn't matter.",

      "“They are no conditions to play a good game of football, but we have to play. We cannot just run away and disappear and not play. So we have to play and try to be lucky.",
      "“Normally when you say lucky you say lucky because you want a good result. The result I want tomorrow is to go home without injuries and that is the luck I want.”",

      "\"We are really pleased,\" Amorim said of the Lammens signing. \"He is a goalkeeper with a lot of potential, I know we are in a moment where the goalkeeper needs to be really strong and have a lot of experience.",
      "\"But also in the moment we have to look at the present but with a focus on the future, it’s a little bit of both. A guy with great potential, one more option to play and he will be ready.",
      "\"Sometimes you as a club, you try to see different options, sometimes you are able to do one option or another, we have an option that can give us different things in the moment but also has the potential to be our goalkeeper for a lot of years. That was our choice in the end.",
      "\"Altay is going to continue (in goal) because it’s a different league, a different country, different trainings, different ball, so we will try to maintain that. They will fight for the position. For this game, it is clear Altay will start.\"",

We have players who are eager, so we will be competitive on Sunday. But they are out, they cannot help us in this game.",

Sometimes it’s hard to point why. It’s the performance, it’s the moment, the bad luck in some moments was hard on him, was hard on us.",
      "“Our thinking is to have a change in the goalkeepers but I wish the best for Andre Onana. He was really good on working, trying to help the players, but sometimes you can have all the quality in the world but you need to change the environment to return to your level.

      "Manchester United are reportedly considering the possibility of playing mid-season friendlies during Champions League matchdays to boost their revenue this season.",
      "United are without European football for the first time since the 2014/15 season and this has left them with a shortfall in their incoming revenue. While it soon became apparent that the Reds would miss out on the Champions League through their Premier League position, hopes rested on winning the Europa League final instead.",
      "However, a lacklustre performance against Tottenham Hotspur saw them miss out on Europe entirely and has left their schedule looking blank in comparison to many of their rivals. With United also exiting the Carabao Cup earlier than anticipated, The Sun understands the Reds are considering arranging friendlies in countries like the UAE with other top clubs who also missed out on Europe.",
      "Notably, AC Milan, RB Leipzig, Lazio and Sevilla all face the prospect of no European football this season and could be potential opponents for the Reds when their domestic rivals are in the Champions League. Ineos have been no strangers to using unorthodox methods to boost the club's finances since arriving at Old Trafford.",
      "At the end of last season, United toured Asia facing two fixtures against local teams. It is believed that tour generated £7.8m while their participation in the Premier League Series banked them a slightly smaller amount.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "The Sun now claims that United would be able to bank half of that amount for a game against AC Milan or potentially more against a smaller European club who may not have the same pull as the Reds. Failure to qualify for the Champions League is thought to cost any given club £100m.",
      "However, this plan could be considered controversial among some supporters considering the travel strain this would put on the Reds' first-team squad during a season where they desperately need to perform better in the Premier League. There is also the increased, and largely unnecessary, risk of picking up more injuries during these tours.",
      "With Financial Fair Play (FFP) such a big consideration for clubs in this day and age, any extra income is vital to ensure money can be spent on new signings. United managed to bring in more players than was expected this summer thanks to player sales with the likes of Alejandro Garnacho and Antony making way for Matheus Cunha, Benjamin Sesko and Bryan Mbeumo.",

      "United invited Gabriel to watch the season's opening game against Arsenal in the directors' box, following the teenager's decision to commit his future to the club for at least the next two years.",
      "Academy prospects would not usually be invited to meet Amorim and watch a Premier League game in the directors' box, but the feeling is that Gabriel is no ordinary talent.",
      "Fletcher has a talented squad at his disposal and is looking to win the U18 Premier League North this season.",
      "The former midfielder succeeded Adam Lawrence as U18 boss in the summer. “I’ve really enjoyed it,” said Fletcher last month about his new role. “From the first time together in Germany at the adidas headquarters, the boys have been fantastic.",
      "\"We had pre-season games at Carrington and then we went to Zagreb, and the performance levels, the attitude, the application, in every game, they’ve been a real pleasure to work with so I’m really enjoying it.",
      "“It’s nice to lead, to be in charge of your own team. I was always in a support role before, so I felt that for the next stage of my development as a coach, it was important that I led a group, and with Adam Lawrence leaving, the opportunity became available and it made sense from a number of reasons.",
      "“I’m really excited to be on the grass every day, working with the team, implementing Manchester United’s style, club ideas alongside some of my own ideas and it’s been really enjoyable. And the most pleasing thing has been the players’ application and buy-in into it and I’m really enjoying seeing them play the United way.”",

      "“If teams want to come and have a go at us, and try to press, we’ve got the ability to play around them, and if they want to leave a high line, we can be devastating.",

      "But Tevez's future had dominated headlines in the build-up to the Manchester derby. “I didn’t read any of the papers. He’s a Manchester United player,” insisted Sir Alex Ferguson.",
      "Tevez's future at Old Trafford had been dramatically thrown into doubt after he gave an exclusive interview to the News of the World. \"I am very sad about this, but I guess what I’m saying is goodbye. I don’t think I’ll be a United player next season,\" he said.",
      "\"They have never made me an offer or given me a contract. I have not been treated as a member of the family. The fans treat me like family, but United have not signed me, so they don’t respect me.\"",
      "Tevez was coming to the end of his two-year United loan, but the deal was expected to be made permanent, with chief executive David Gill stating the situation would be resolved in 'early June'.",
      "Although United had communicated their intention to sign Tevez permanently throughout the season, the framework for a deal hadn't been finalised and the player felt he'd been disrespected, which led to a dramatic departure.",
      "United submitted their proposal, but it was too late. Tevez's representatives informed the club he would be leaving, and reports then emerged linking him with Liverpool and 'noisy neighbours' City entered discussions.",
      "“He [Tevez] was a thorn in our side. I thought he played exceptionally well,\" said Mark Hughes after City's defeat in the derby. \"I’ve read the reports, but I don’t want to comment.\"",
      "Tevez completed his move to City for £25.5million in mid-July and said: \"City showed me their ambition to be one of the biggest clubs in the world and I was happy to join.",
      "\"Money was not the most important thing about my move. I have a coach who wants me and a good fanbase and environment around me. I'm excited about working with Mark Hughes and building a good relationship with him. The objective is to win the league and I'm here to win things.\"",
      "Speaking about the controversial transfer years later, Rio Ferdinand told William Hill: \"The big one was when Tevez went there from us. That moment I was like 'rah' because I knew how good he was.",
      "\"We knew exactly what player they were getting. We were like 'nah', at the time I was like 'this guy doesn't understand the rivalry, what is he doing?' But at the same time, I knew the story behind it.",
      "\"He wanted to sign the contract at Man United well before that time. United delayed and didn't come to him, and the kind of guy he is, I have respect for him in the end for it, because he said you know what, you have disrespected me.",
      "\"He thought, 'I don't care what you offer me I am not signing'. I remember David Gill, the chairman at the time, asked me to ring him and speak to him and his agent and try to tell him to listen and sign.",
      "\"I remember his agent saying, 'Rio, it doesn't matter what money they offer him, he won't sign. He feels he has been disrespected, so that's it'. As much as I was disappointed, I respected it.\"",
      "However, signing Tevez from under Ferguson's nose wasn't enough for City, who commissioned a billboard to rub their rivals' face in it. David Pullan was City’s chief brand and marketing officer and wanted to make a grand statement.",
      "Pullan masterminded the 'Welcome to Manchester' billboard and persuaded club chiefs to commission it",
      "“He didn’t want to run it because he felt it was antagonistic towards United fans at a time when the whole Abu Dhabi ethos was to be respectful,” Pullan told The Athletic.",
      "“They [the owners] didn’t want to play that game of being antagonistic. I sat down with him and said, ‘Look, this isn’t a big two fingers up at United. It’s tongue-in-cheek, it’s funny, it’s a way of showing our fans that, despite all the changes and all the money coming into the club, we still understand them and we still care about them. We aren’t being disrespectful'.",
      "\"It’s celebratory. It’s the first opportunity for City fans to celebrate getting one over on their old rivals, so why not? He was persuaded that it wasn’t a negative thing to do. The fans loved it. And the rest is history.”",
      "The billboard was positioned in the heart of town in Deansgate. The artwork was soon splattered with red paint and it continued to be targeted by angry fans.",
      "Pullan continued: “Every morning, there would be socks filled with red paint lying on the street at the bottom of the poster. Overnight, the United fans would come down with tins of red paint, fill up these socks and throw them at the poster to try to turn it red.\"",
      "The billboard cost £30,000, but Pullan described it as \"one of the most valuable pieces of marketing ever\".",
      "The world was listening when Ferguson responded to the stunt. \"The billboard in Manchester is just City all over, isn't it? They are a small club with a small mentality, and all they can talk about is Manchester United,\" he said.",
      "\"That's all they've done and they can't get away from it. The poster is a stupid thing using Tevez in that way and they've shown an arrogance which does them no favours.",
      "\"It's clear that it's a go at us because they think taking Tevez away from Manchester United is a triumph. But it's poor stuff. I thought Tevez would go to City a long time ago, so it didn't come as any surprise.\"",
      "Ferguson continued: \"There is an edge being put on us because of all the buying City have done. For me, City's biggest triumph could simply be getting those players to the club. I don't know if they will do anything.",
      "\"It's not easy to get into that top four. City's spending is demoralising only if you panic about the buying. They have the money, and when they offer it, most of it will be cash.",
      "\"But, at the end of the day, Everton did well against us, they did brilliantly against Liverpool and well against Chelsea last season. So it will not be easy for City and they don't even come into my equation at all.",
      "\"I don't look upon City as my biggest challenge. The best City team against the best Everton team is still a game, isn't it? For all the buying they have done, they still have to pick a team with balance.",
      "\"And that won't be easy for Mark. What's he got, eight strikers? So if he picks a squad to go to Chelsea he has to leave four behind. He has to deal with that and I know it will not be easy.\"",
      "Ferguson's response caused a stir in the Etihad boardroom. “The fact it irritated him caused a bit of a wobble with the owners. They didn’t want to take him on, head-on,\" Pullan explained.",
      "\"They didn’t want to make it out that City was the future, United were the past. We weren’t trying to annoy Ferguson, but the fact he allowed himself to get annoyed by something so small tells you everything about the direction of travel at that time.",
      "\"It wasn’t the intention, but the fact it got to him would have been seen, certainly among the fans, as a very positive side-effect.”",
      "Tevez later scored a brace in a 2-1 win against United in the League Cup semi-final and sprinted to the touchline with a message for Gary Neville, gesturing that he talked too much.",
      "Neville had spoken in the media to say United were justified in not signing Tevez. The tensions between the clubs continued to simmer and reached boiling point when City visited Old Trafford in the league.",
      "United won 4-3 thanks to a late Michael Owen goal, and Ferguson gave City’s chief communications officer, Vicky Kloss, the hairdryer treatment for the 'Welcome to Manchester' billboard in the tunnel.",
      "Ferguson believed Kloss had been responsible for the stunt. \"The goal for this club is to win the league, it doesn't matter what we do against Man City. We want to be at the top,\" he said after the game.",
      "\"Okay, at the moment, we have a neighbour and sometimes they're noisy. You cannot do anything about that. You just have to get on with your life. The demonstration of our playing power was obvious to everyone, we were fantastic today.\"",
      "Tevez was involved in more controversy at the end of the 2011/12 season when he waved a banner reading 'RIP Fergie' during a title-winning parade.",
      "The banner was intended to respond to Ferguson’s claim that \"not in his lifetime\" would City be superior in Manchester, but it was widely considered distasteful, and City apologised.",
      "A City spokeswoman said: \"The creation of the tasteless material is in itself reprehensible and in accepting and brandishing it, Carlos has made a significant error of judgment.",
      "\"The club wishes to express its sincerest apologies to Sir Alex Ferguson and Manchester United Football Club for any offence or distress caused.\"",
      "Tevez attempted to clarify: \"I got carried away in the excitement of the moment and I certainly didn't mean any disrespect to Sir Alex Ferguson, who I admire as a man and a manager.\"",
      "United were happy with City's statement and it seemed the incident had been put to bed, but Tevez stoked the fire again when speaking to Spanish media. “It seems like Ferguson is the president of England,\" he said.",
      "\"Because every time he speaks badly of a player or when he always talked rubbish about me, I never went out to say he had to apologise. When you mess up you should go out and apologise, but I do not apologise.”",
      "Despite there appearing to be some bad blood between Tevez and Ferguson, the player insisted in 2016 there was no fallout.",
      "“With Ferguson, nothing bad happened, it was a normal relationship. I went to United for two years on loan, and in the final year, Ferguson told me that they were going to buy me permanently,\" he said.",
      "“We got to the Champions League final in Rome and I didn’t have any contract on the table, even though they’d spent the whole year telling me that, so I went to City and they complained, but I never had the option of signing for United, so I was free.”",
      "Ferguson did not speak to Tevez after his exit and was unimpressed to learn some of his squad remained friendly with him. \"Carlos Tevez was my close friend, but I was not pleased when he joined Manchester City,\" Patrice Evra said.",
      "“‘Carlito’, I said. ‘What are you doing? This shirt isn’t you. I have been to your house and you still have a picture of yourself wearing a United shirt near your pool table. You are a Red, you know deep in your heart that you are a Red’. Deep down, I think he still had a great affection for United.",
      "\"He once told me that he would always respect United fans. I know he did well for City, I know he was a great player for them, but he’d won league titles and the Champions League with United.\"",
      "Tevez was sold by City to Juventus in 2013 having won the Premier League and FA Cup during his time at the Etihad.",

      "Sam Mather's move to Turkish club Kayserispor collapsed on Friday after Manchester United decided there wasn't time to complete the deal.",
      "Mather, 21, was keen to leave this summer to kickstart his career in the senior game. Talks were at an advanced stage with Kayserispor on Turkey's deadline day, but the deal collapsed and Mather remains at United.",
      "Kayserispor pushed hard to sign Mather on a permanent deal. The fee and buyback clause were agreed, and it's understood personal terms were also verbally agreed with the forward.",
      "United outlined a time for an agreement to be finalised and sign-off by the board was required, but the club eventually decided they did not have enough time to facilitate the transfer.",
      "Mather will now have to deal with the disappointment of missing out on a fresh start.",
      "The youngster has outgrown academy football and was hungry to begin the next chapter in his career. Mather had attracted interest from Turkey, Sweden and Germany in the summer window.",
      "Mather's situation will be revisited in the January transfer window. He will spend time training with the first team and making appearances in academy fixtures over the next few months.",
      "He has predominantly played on the left wing during his time in the academy, but his preferred position is the No.10 role.",
      "Mather's contract at Old Trafford expires in the summer of 2027.",

      "It was difficult for Manchester United supporters to imagine a scenario where Kobbie Mainoo may not be part of the club's long-term future.",
      "And yet, as we sit here on the eve of the first match since the 2025 summer transfer window shut, United head coach Ruben Amorim is processing how he can keep the 20-year-old happy. Since the Portuguese head coach replaced Erik ten Hag, keeping Mainoo content has been a task which has eluded him him.",
      "Amorim's 3-4-2-1 system has not benefitted Mainoo. The midfielder has not been able to nail down a spot in the two holding midfield roles or the two more advanced positions.",
      "This season has been the most challenging yet for Mainoo as he has found himself playing second fiddle to Bruno Fernandes, who has been picked ahead of him. Amorim has told reporters that Mainoo is in direct competition with the captain and while it is impossible to drop Fernandes at present, that does not make the pill any easier for the Englishman to swallow.",
      "So, what must United do with Mainoo? Well, it is clear that they want to keep the midfielder in their squad or else they would have granted him his loan request at the end of August.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "But if they wish to keep Mainoo, Amorim needs to make a promise that could be unpopular. He must agree to sell Fernandes next summer.",
      "While it could and should be hard to stomach for United fans considering that Fernandes has been the club's star performer in recent years, it is the only way to keep Mainoo. The midfielder is heading towards the end of his career at the top level and there is undoubted interest from Saudi Arabia.",
      "Reports have suggested that Fernandes has kept the door open to the Saudi Pro League. If this is the case, it could make financial sense for United to sell up if an offer between £80-100m is on the table. Should they do that, they have a ready-made replacement in Mainoo to come into the squad.",
      "The fee for Fernandes would also fund a move for Carlos Baleba to partner Mainoo should Casemiro leave at the end of his current contract. United has previously been guilty of delaying transfers for too long and eventually missing out on the big bucks.",
      "If they choose to hold on for too long again, they could end up being forced to allow Mainoo to leave. It is clear he wants regular playing time and if United are not going to offer that, then they must learn to accept that one of their brightest academy graduates is going to leave next summer.",

      "Manchester United midfielder Kobbie Mainoo was not included in the Reds' 21-man squad for the Premier League season but will still be eligible to play in the top flight for Ruben Amorim.",
      "Mainoo has had a rocky time playing under Amorim since the Portuguese arrived at Old Trafford in November. The midfielder has not played the amount of games he would have liked and has found himself struggling to fit into the new system.",
      "After signing Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo, United have chosen to move captain Bruno Fernandes deeper meaning Mainoo is now in direct competition with the Portuguese playmaker for that position. The Englishman's only start this season came in the Carabao Cup defeat at Grimsby Town and soon afterwards he requested a loan spell away from the club.",
      "This request was denied by Amorim and Mainoo would stay put in the summer. However, there is clearly a desire on Mainoo's side to gain more minutes and, as of yet, it is unclear whether that is something United can offer.",
      "Unsurprisingly, Mainoo is a popular figure among the fanbase and many fans would have had their hearts in their mouths when they saw that the midfielder was not included in Amorim's squad list for the remainder of the campaign. However, thanks to the midfielder's age, he does not have to be registered along with most of his first-team colleagues.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "The Premier League allows its clubs to name an indefinite list of U21 players who they would like to see feature in the division this season on top of the maximum of 25 required on the squad list. An U21 player is defined as anyone who was born on or after January 1, 2004 this season.",
      "As such Mainoo (born April 19, 2005), Leny Yoro (born November 13, 2005) and Ayden Heaven (born September 22, 2006), were all able to feature in the U21 list rather than taking up a space in the main 21-man squad list. As for that squad list, United must ensure that no more than 17 players do not fulfill the 'Home Grown Player' requirement.",
      "To classify as homegrown, a player must, regardless of their nationality, must have been registered with any club affiliated to The Football Association or the Football Association of Wales for a period, continuous or not, of three entire seasons, or 36 months, before his 21st birthday.

      "A football coach who oversaw the development of Erling Haaland and Benjamin Sesko believes the Manchester United forward will reach the same level as the Manchester City goal guzzler.",
      "Rene Aufhaser, who helped mould Haaland and Sesko into two of Europe's most exciting forwards at RB Salzburg, was asked to make a comparison between the two. Ahead of this weekend's Manchester Derby, he boldly said the latter, who joined the Red Devils from RB Leipzig this summer, will be as good as Haaland.",
      "So far, the 22-year-old has only started one game under Ruben Amorim, which was the disastrous League Cup second round exit to Grimsby Town. However, after seeing both Haaland and Sesko when they were both raw football talents, Aufhaser is confident the United forward will fulfil his potential.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "\"He will develop in the next one and two years, I’m sure. Erling reached his mark after his transfer from Dortmund to Man City and we will see.",
      "\"I am quite sure Benji will reach this mark after one or two years. But, of course, Erling is the top. He has 10 out of 10 from me.”",
      "It's not the first time a direct comparison has been made between Sesko and Haaland. The young forward even claimed many of his team-mates told him he is a better player than the Norwegian, who boasts 88 goals and 17 assists in 100 Premier League games for City.",
      "In a previous interview, Sesko said: \"Such comparisons motivate me and give me energy. They do not represent pressure. I will listen and learn, so I can be even better than he is.",
      "\"My team-mates at the club tell me that Haaland and I are very similar, especially in terms of speed. Most of them even tell me that I'm better than him!\"",
      "Sesko did row back on those comments when his move to United was secured. This was perhaps wise as he is yet to make an impact in any of his three appearances off the bench for United in the Premier League.",
      "Over the course of his career with RB Salzburg, FC Liefering and RB Leipzig, Sesko has scored 100 goals and contributed 26 assists in 228 career appearances. He also boasts 16 goals in 43 appearances for Slovenia, but failed to get on the scoresheet in his nation's 2-2 draw against Sweden and 3-0 loss to Switzerland.",
      "Nevertheless, he was still backed by international team-mate Andraz Sporar, who urged patience. He told reporters: \"What does he bring to United? Everything. He has speed, power, intelligence, good football IQ.",
      "\"I believe he can be a complete striker in the next two or three years. But he’s still young. He will help Manchester United a lot, they just need to be patient. I believe he’ll score the goals and every year he will be better and better.\"",

      "Pep Guardiola and Ruben Amorim have confirmed they will be without several key players for the Manchester Derby at the Etihad Stadium on Sunday afternoon.",
      "Manchester United have fewer concerns but the majority are relatively fresh issues with Matheus Cunha and Mason Mount both forced off in the 3-2 win over Burnley nearly a fortnight ago while Diogo Dalot pulled out of the Portugal squad.",
      "The trio have been confirmed as unavailable by Amorim for the trip across the city and have thus joined Lisandro Martinez in the treatment room at Carrington.",
      "\"They are out for this game, I don’t know how long it’s going to take,\" he said at a press conference on Friday. \"We need these guys to be a competitive team. We have very good players, who are eager to play, so we will be competitive on Sunday. But they are out.\"",
      "Pushed on how long they the three players may be out for, Amorim added: \"I don’t want to say. If you talk to Cunha outside, he will say he can play this game. They are pushing really hard.\"",
      "Meanwhile, for City, Guardiola looks set to be without a number of important players but could also welcome back a key trio. Starting with the positive news, Josko Gvardiol and Savinho have both returned to training recently and could therefore feature while Phil Foden is expected to be available.",
      "The September international break was not seemingly kind to Guardiola though, with Omar Marmoush getting injured while playing for Egypt just a few days after John Stones was forced to withdraw from the England squad. The City boss gave updates on that duo while also confirming other members that are on the injury list.",

      "Manchester United have been thanked by Sheffield Wednesday manager Henrik Pedersen after they loaned highly-rated defender Harry Amass to the South Yorkshire club on deadline day.",
      "The Owls are currently in crisis in the Championship with the club's owner Dejphon Chansiri cutting an unpopular figure at present. Wednesday are under a transfer embargo - and were blocked from completing deals that would add expenses on to their wage bill.",
      "This has led to Pedersen having a threadbare squad to choose from - and without any realistic means of improving that situation. Wednesday could not sign any players permanently or on loan for a fee this summer and the same is in place for the next two transfer windows.",
      "However, United were happy to send Amass to the South Yorkshire club as they wanted him to gain regular first-team football this campaign. United are believed to be footing the bill for his wages which allowed Wednesday to complete the transfer.",
      "Speaking ahead of his team's Championship clash with Bristol City on Saturday, Pedersen thanked United for their help. \"I think we have to be proud, and we have to be very thankful, because what they [United] have done for us is fantastic and big respect for what they have done,\" the manager told BBC Radio Sheffield.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "\"I'm proud because they could see that Sheffield Wednesday could be a good space and a good club for Harry and the trust they have in this direction, and on the other hand what that has done for us, it's a big respect, and thanks.\"",
      "When asked if Amass was happy to have joined a club that is so clearly struggling - both on and off the pitch - Pedersen added: \"He feels really well, when I speak with him and see him on the pitch, I see a concentrated and happy boy, who likes his new life in Sheffield and he's doing really well.",
      "\"You always have expectations before when you're choosing players, but it feels like he feels really well and I'm really happy that he's in.\" Wednesday only sit off the bottom of the Championship table owing to their arch rivals Sheffield United losing all of their opening four matches this season.",
      "United have held no reservations in sending some of their younger players to the Championship previously. Radek Vitek could face Amass at Hillsborough this weekend having signed for Bristol City after agreeing a new contract at Old Trafford.",
      "Meanwhile, midfielder Toby Collyer is on loan at West Bromwich Albion. The biggest recent success story from a Championship loan came when Amad was loaned to Sunderland.",
      "Upon his return, the Ivorian was thrust into the first team picture at United and has not looked back since.",

      "Cast your mind back to November 2022, and it felt like Manchester United entered a watershed moment in their history.",
      "With the Glazers overseeing the football operation, club legend Cristiano Ronaldo took the unprecedented step of undertaking an interview with Piers Morgan. During that conversation, he aired all his grievances about the club, the manager and even some of his former teammates to really distance himself from Old Trafford.",
      "United had little choice but to release Ronaldo and the decision was heralded as a victory for Erik ten Hag. The Portuguese forward was the biggest name to try to use his power to influence change at Old Trafford and it had been quashed by the manager and the boardroom.",
      "At the time many of us, myself included, thought the decision to part ways with Ronaldo was the right one. He had burnt bridges purposefully at United and Ten Hag really could not afford to be undermined in such a way.",
      "What we should have realised from then onwards is that Ten Hag's authority had reached its crescendo and it was only downhill from there. The Jadon Sancho saga followed and the Dutchman got his way again but after the winger left on loan for the second time, Ten Hag had just two more months remaining in the job at Old Trafford.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "While many once again agreed with the principled decision of moving Sancho on, Ten Hag was not rejuvenating the players that were remaining and he had to go. Fast forward to this September's international break and that decision from Sir Jim Ratcliffe and his Ineos colleagues has proven to be the right one.",
      "At the beginning of the break, Ten Hag was fired just three matches into his spell at Bayer Leverkusen. The Bundesliga club suggesting that it had become obvious the Dutchman was not the right man to rebuild them following Xabi Alonso's exit.",
      "Then on Thursday, United commemorated four years since Ronaldo returned to Old Trafford and made his second home debut against Newcastle. Any anger or distrust from the Reds towards the Portuguese forward clearly long forgotten.",
      "However, will United commemorate four years since Ten Hag first entered the dugout for a competitive fixture next August? My bet is no.",
      "It may not have been plain sailing for the Reds post-Ten Hag with Ruben Amorim clearly suffering his fair share of struggles too, it is also obvious that United were right to sack his predecessor. Any lingering concerns that this move was premature have now been put to bed for good.",

      "Brighton & Hove Albion have confirmed they have parted ways with technical director David Weir as Manchester United continue to mull over a proposed approach for Carlos Baleba.",
      "Weir, who has worked in the backroom set-ups at Rangers, Aston Villa and Brentford, joined the Seagulls in 2018 as loan manager. Having held that position for four years, the ex-Scotland international became technical assistant for nearly half a year before eventually taking on the role of technical director.",
      "His main duties at the club were to oversee player recruitment and he was responsible, in part, for Brighton signing Baleba in 2023. However, in a statement Brighton owner, Tony Bloom, explained that the Premier League club were now looking to go in a new direction.",
      "\"David has served our club well, but we now wish to refresh our technical area with new leadership and direction,\" Bloom said. \"I'd like to thank David for everything he has done for us, and to wish him well for the future.\"",
      "Brighton CEO Paul Barber added: \"I have greatly enjoyed working with David over these past eight years, and have appreciated his support and hard work throughout this period. I wish David all the best going forward.\"",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "Weir's departure signifies a shift within Brighton's recruitment department, which may alter how United approach potentially bringing Baleba to Old Trafford. At this stage, there are no signs Weir's exit may disrupt the Reds' plans, but it may lead to the Seagulls having an even harder stance on transfer negotiations.",
      "So far this season, Baleba has continued his progression - starting in all three Premier League matches prior to the international break. Crystal Palace's Adam Wharton and Nottingham Forest's Elliot Anderson have also been linked with United in recent weeks as they start to plan for the January transfer window and beyond.",

      "Lammens arrived from Royal Antwerp for £18.2million, plus add-ons, late on transfer deadline day.",

      "Emery omitted Martinez from Aston Villa's squad on the eve of deadline day, which hinted that he could be on the move, but the 33-year-old will remain in Birmingham this season.",
      "Discussing Martinez at a press conference, Emery explained: “Everything that happens with players we have, maybe staying, maybe they were close to leaving, maybe other players were close to others or to join us. For me, it is normal, I understand it completely, everything.",
      "“Staying here, Emi Martinez, it is good news, I am so, so happy. He is the best goalkeeper in the world and his commitment to Aston Villa is massive.",
      "“He is always training to get his best and he is always respecting Aston Villa. It is not changing. Some circumstances happen, but everyone is happy, the energy today was very good.",

      "\"Altay is going to continue (in goal) because it’s a different league, a different country, different trainings, different ball, so we will try to maintain that. They will fight for the position. For this game, it is clear Altay will start.\"",

      "“I think Manchester United really trust him for the present, but also the future. They believe that this is one of the best young goalkeepers in the world, and so they really trust this boy.",
      "“They wanted Lammens strongly. Obviously, there was also the opportunity to go for Emi Martinez, which is a completely different profile – obviously to add some leadership, but also with different costs in terms of salary and transfer fee.",
      "“So they decided for Lammens, because they believe this is the ideal solution for the present and the future. I’m sure that Lammens has a very good chances to be the starting goalkeeper at Manchester United.”",
      "In his press conference, Amorim added on Lammens: “We are really pleased, he is a goalkeeper with a lot of potential.",
      "“We are in a moment where we need a goalkeeper to be really strong, have a lot of experience, but also in a moment we have to look at the present, but with focus on the future, a little bit both. He is one more option to play. He will be ready.”"

      "Yes, Wirtz produced nothing of note in Liverpool’s opening three Premier League games and his outspoken critics will continue to sharpen their pitchforks for as long as his struggles last. However, the former British record signing has been a victim of Arne Slot changing his style, so it’s not entirely his fault that he’s looked out of place as the champions get accustomed to a fresh approach.",
      "Barring the odd exciting touch or pass, the Premier League is yet to see the best of this special talent, though goals and assists should come once he and a player in a typical No.10 role are bedded into this Liverpool side. By which point, his many naysayers would have done a Homer and retreated into the bushes.",

No content is distributed like this anymore; TV, music, film and even books are accessed using models far closer to what Ligue Un are doing.

      "The Mailbox did a dangerous thing this week. It made us think: which country is the best exporter to the Premier League?",
      "Amid the flak flying around Florian Wirtz right now, and while musing over the success of the Portuguese lads at Manchester United, Mailbox stalwart Badwolf pondered which nation produces the best imports into Our League.",
      "Immediately, all hope of any work being done for the following hour vanished. Down the rabbit hole we went…",
      "Wistfully, we reminisced over our personal favourites. Winty went for David Silva because, well, he’s magic. Continuing the theme of pint-sized sorcerers, Joe Williams opted for Juninho. Some other names thrown around the desk: Cantona, Klinsmann, Hazard, Henry, Aguero…",
      "So no consensus there over the best nation to import from. Come to think of it, how do we answer that question?",
      "We could build an algorithm to mine the data… f*** that. Spelling ‘algorithm’ is arduous enough for a Friday, we’re definitely not building one.",
      "Like the rest of the nation’s workforce, we hoped AI might help us get an early dart to the pub. ChatGPT’s answer: ‘France for quantity and consistency; Portugal and Spain for elite influence.’ Thanks for f*** all.",
      "No, instead of digging deep ourselves to answer this question, we’re mining our greatest resource: the knowledgeable and devilishly-handsome F365 readers. You started it, so you can finish it.",
      "So get involved, first by giving a simple answer to a complex question in the poll below.",
      "Then head Below The Line to state your case, and offer up your favourite individual imports. We’ve given you some stats and numbers below if that’s your thing.",
      "Be warned: discussing your personal foreign hero can quickly descend into a game of ‘name the most random foreign player you can think of’ and, instantly, productivity plummets to zero. So you might as well get off now and do it in the pub anyway…",

      "Man Utd head coach Ruben Amorim has confirmed that Altay Bayindir will start ahead of Senne Lammens against Man City in the Manchester Derby on Sunday.",
      "After bringing in Lammens from Royal Antwerp on deadline day, Onana was allowed to join Trabzonspor on loan until the end of the season.",
      "Reports have claimed that Amorim saw Onana’s exit from Old Trafford as key to his rebuild of the club and it was felt that the Cameroon international ‘was showing a lack of involvement and interest in working for the team in the final days before the international break.’",
      "It’s not yet clear whether Lammens has been brought in as number one or to challenge Bayindir but Amorim confirmed on Friday that the latter is starting against Man City on Sunday.",
      "READ: Missing Men: When Gary Neville fed the Goat in the final Maine Road Manchester derby",
      "Amorim told a press conference: “Altay is going to continue. It is a different league, a different country, different training, different ball. So we will try to maintain that and they will fight for the position but for me in this game is clear, Altay will start.”",
      "On Lammens, the Man Utd boss added: “He is a goalkeeper with a lot of potential. I know that we are in a moment where the goalkeeper needs to be really strong and have a lot of experience. We are also in the moment where we have to look at the present but also with a focus on the future – so it is a little bit of both. He’s a guy with a great potential that is one more option [for us] to play, and he will be ready.”",
      "When asked why Man Utd signed Lammens over Aston Villa’s Emi Martinez, Amorim continued: “We have an option that can give us different things in the moment but also has a great potential to be our goalkeeper for a lot of years so that was out choice in the end.”",
      "On why Onana had to leave Old Trafford, Amorim said: “I think we understood that this needed a change and sometimes it is hard to point out why. Sometimes it is the moment, the bad luck in some moments.",
      "“It is hard on him, on us. Our thinking is to have a change in the goalkeepers but I wish the best for Andre Onana.",
      "“He was really good at working and trying to help the players, but sometimes you can have all the quality in the world but you need a change.”",
      "Injured trio Matheus Cunha, Mason Mount and Diogo Dalot, who cost Man Utd £136.5m in total, will be missing against Man City at the Etihad.",
      "Amorim said of the trio: “They are out for this game. I don’t know how long it is going to take. We need our guys to be a very competitive team but we have very good players who are eager to play, so we will be competitive on Sunday but they are out. They cannot help us in this game.”",
      "When asked how long they will be out for, Amorim replied: “I don’t want to say. If you talk to Cunha he will say he is able to play this game. So I don’t know. We will manage day-by-day. They are pushing really hard and that is a good thing.”",
      "A “absolutely hopeless” Manchester United star has been blasted ahead of this weekend’s derby against Manchester City at the Etihad.",
      "Man Utd forward Joshua Zirkzee is one of the players on Juventus’ list to replace Dusan Vlahovic in Turin, according to reports.",
      "Andre Onana is the latest Erik ten Hag signing to leave under Man Utd head coach Ruben Amorim, with the goalkeeper joining Trabzonspor on loan.",

      "‘Unfortunately, he’s been sidelined. Amorim isn’t held in high regard, but there are fans in Turin. Despite his slip-up in England, too many have failed at Old Trafford.’",
      "Former Man Utd winger Lee Sharpe reckons Zirkzee is a “real baller” who will eventually come good for Amorim and start contributing more.",
      "Sharpe said back in May: “I like Zirkzee – he was unfortunate to get injured when he did, but he’s a real baller and I think he can be a superstar for Manchester United if he can get games under his belt.",
      "“He needs a regular run. I don’t think he’s had a 10-game stint where he has actually played week in, week out.",
      "“There were reports that he wasn’t quite fit when he signed, so it took him a bit of time to get up to speed. I think he was just finding his feet when he got injured but I think he’s going to prove a real key player next season.”",

      "Cristiano Ronaldo will once again attempt to persuade Bruno Fernandes to leave Man Utd in January and move to Saudi Arabia, according to reports.",
      "Al-Hilal made Fernandes their priority early on in the summer with the Saudi Pro League side willing to give the Red Devils midfielder a tax-free contract worth £700,000-a-week plus bonuses, which is around three times what he earns at Old Trafford.",
      "After talks between Fernandes’ agent, Miguel Pinho, and the Saudi club, the Man Utd captain decided to stay at the Premier League club for the time being.",
      "Revealing why he opted to stay at Man Utd over a move to Saudi, Fernandes – who has also attracted interest from Al-Nassr and Al-Ittihad – said: “The president of Al Hilal called me a month ago to ask me about it.",
      "“There was a waiting period for me to think about the future. As I have always said, I would be willing to do it if Manchester United thought so.",
      "“I spoke to coach Ruben Amorim who, throughout that period, was very annoying to me not to go! The club said they would not be willing to sell me, only if I wanted to leave, that it was not a financial issue.”",
      "READ: Missing Men: When Gary Neville fed the Goat in the final Maine Road Manchester derby",
      "Fernandes added: “It was a very ambitious proposal. The president was a fantastic person. We never discussed the amount [initially]. With my agent? Of course.",
      "“Then, I spoke to my wife and family, and she asked me what my personal goals were in my career. She was someone who always supported me a lot.",
      "“It was an easy move, even at a family level. I had Joao Cancelo there, my children are used to playing with him in the national team, we have a great friendship.",
      "“But I want to maintain myself at the highest level, playing in the big competitions. and I feel capable of it.”",
      "In a fresh update on Saudi interest in Fernandes, Fabrizio Romano revealed earlier this week that clubs in the Middle East are ready to return for the Man Utd captain in 2026.",
      "Romano explained on his YouTube channel: “From Saudi, they want to return in the future. For 2026, keep an eye on Saudi because they will return. And then, it’s going to be up to Bruno to say ‘yes, I want to come’ or ‘no, I want to stay in Europe, no, I want to stay in Manchester United’.",
      "“But from Saudi, they want to return for Bruno Fernandes, and they keep the name of Bruno Fernandes in their list for the future targets. Keep a close eye on the situation of Bruno Fernandes because Saudi want to return.”",
      "And Spanish website Fichajes claim that current Portugal international team-mate Ronaldo ‘pressures’ Fernandes to join a Saudi club in January.",
      "Ronaldo has ‘stepped up his efforts to convince his compatriot to join the Saudi Pro League’ as the former Man Utd striker’s ‘role in Saudi Arabia’s football project goes beyond his performance on the pitch’.",
      "Although he failed to persuade Fernandes to join him in the summer transfer window, the report adds that ‘interest remains alive and could be revived by January 2026’.",
      "The report continues: ‘The English club is experiencing financial difficulties and could seriously consider selling one of its most valuable assets if an attractive offer comes in. Fernandes is entering the final stretch of his contract, increasing the pressure to define his future.’",
      "Man Utd captain Bruno Fernandes has hit back at pundits and former players who have questioned his demeanour in the past.",
      "Are you really a world-record holder if you have to lower yourself to counting goals scored against Scotland? Cristiano Ronaldo is an embarrassing fraud.",

      "It is, in short, a very Big Weekend. Enjoy.",
      "A Sunday afternoon treat in store for us all in one of those games absolutely guaranteed to provide narrative out the wazoo no matter what happens.",
      "The fixture computer has been cruel indeed to Manchester City, compelling them to play their first two home games against the teams who inflicted the most embarrassing league defeats upon them at the Etihad last season.",
      "History has already repeated itself thanks to Spurs’ alarmingly controlled and tension-free 2-0 victory a few weeks ago, and City really cannot afford any kind of repeat of the late nonsense United pulled on them in a 2-1 win during the depths of City’s late 2024 despair.",
      "Whoever loses this really is in big trouble.",
      "If it’s United, then the difficulty of the fixture list will provide only scant mitigation for a poor league start (not to mention the Grimsby unpleasantness) in which Ruben Amorim has been lucky to nick a point against Fulham and even luckier to beat Burnley at home.",
      "He already sits atop the reformed Sack Race now Nuno Espirito Santo has been Marinakised and has both Chelsea and Liverpool to worry about in the weeks ahead.",
      "If it’s City, then the early crisis club mantle passes to the blue half of Manchester after three straight defeats and a title challenge petering out in mid-September and renewed questions about whether Pep Guardiola has the energy or desire to follow through on building himself another great City side on the back of all 24/25’s relative struggle.",
      "The most damning thing for City would be the fact that those three straight defeats would have come without a meaningful title rival in sight; that looms with next week’s trip to the Emirates which really would start to look like a fixture that could end City’s Premier League season before we’ve even reached the second international break.",
      "Or it could be a draw, in which case no firm answers can be reached but they’re probably both f*cked.",

Which all means the negotiations to appoint a replacement they hadn’t given a moment’s thought to previously were conducted in record time, with Ange Postecoglou appointed mere hours after Nuno’s midnight axe.",
      "Really, it’s just another reminder of what an efficient, well-run club Nottingham Forest are these days. That’s just the speed at which they can get things done.",
      "And another example of how efficient and clear-headed Forest are is in the way they’ve gone straight out and snaffled themselves a manager to provide seamless, frictionless continuity given the obvious similarities in the way he and Nuno operate.",
      "Yes, if unfortunate circumstances outside your control just after the end of the transfer window force you to replace the manager who last season delivered success wildly beyond any reasonable expectation, then really all you can do is go out and appoint the closest thing you can find to what you’ve lost.",
      "Or, of course, there’s the other option, which is to look at what’s worked so well for you and that departing manager and the squad you’d built for him over the last 18 months, and then appoint literally the most polar opposite manager it is possible to imagine, one whose tactics led a bigger and wealthier and far more established club to 17th place last season.",
      "It’s a genuinely brilliant slice of nonsense, this, and one that has absolutely no downside. It’s a plan so stupid that it might in fact be genius and actually work, in which case: great. There really are few things more entertaining to watch in football these days than Angeball when it works.",
      "But do you know what is one of the few things more entertaining to watch in football these days than Angeball when it works? Angeball when it doesn’t.",
      "If you’re not enormously excited by the prospect of Nikola Milenkovic playing a high line then we really are very different people.",
      "At the other end, though, Forest absolutely do have the attacking tools to cause teams serious pain when given freedom and licence to roam and with chests swelled with pride by one of Ange’s patented inspirational team talks.",
      "There’s a reason everyone who has played for Postecoglou seems to adore the bloke. It’s just who he is, mate.",
      "And of course the fixture computer has sent him to Arsenal for his first game back in the Premier League.",
      "It’s unlikely Ange has had time to get all his ideas across to his new charges, which for this game might well be for the best. It is a bit of a free hit for him anyway. Just pump the players’ tyres and send them out there. Get any kind of result and it sets him up for potentially the sort of instant ‘WTF?’ impact he had in those very early games at Tottenham.",

      "Always a highlight of this first post-interlull matchday, of course. We’ve all been starved of delicious Barclays for an agonising, drawn-out fortnight but when it comes back it comes back strong with all those late summer signings set for debuts, from Isak against Burnley to his assorted replacements for Newcastle, to Xavi Simons and Randal Kolo Muani at Spurs, or Harvey Elliott for Villa, and the quite brilliant fact we really don’t actually know with any compelling certainty who will be in either goal for the Manchester derby.",
      "But Isak is clearly the star attraction here. Given that he’s short of match sharpness and had precious little time with his new team-mates due to confirmation of his move coming so late in the window and having to head pretty much straight off to international duty with Sweden, it’s very possible – likely even – that he is only on the bench for Liverpool at Turf Moor.",
      "That’s only a minor consolation for Burnley, though, who will have to deal with a still-elite attack posing nightmarish threats from every direction while also knowing that just as the fatigue of chasing Wirtz and Ekitike and Salah around for an hour or so really starts to kick in, they’re likely to have to deal with perhaps the Premier League’s best centre-forward stepping off the bench with sky-high motivation and myriad points to prove. Very best of luck to you.",

      "West Ham’s 3-0 win at Nottingham Forest just before the international break was perhaps the single most discombobulating result of that entire 30-match intro to the new Premier League season.",

      "But the chaotic final 10 minutes at the City Ground changed everything. It provided cover for Forest to do what they obviously wanted to do to Nuno, for one thing, but also sent the Hammers into the international break looking a very different beast and with potentially a very different season to the one everyone had prescribed for them.",
      "There is still the sense that it was just a freak nonsense. The goals coming in a rush at the end as they did certainly adds to that sense.",
      "So the challenge for Graham Potter and his players is to immediately disprove that theory. To immediately use it as a springboard to launch a season that had started so miserably.",
      "And for that reason there really are few better fixtures to follow it for West Ham than Tottenham at home. Spurs fans have long mocked West Ham for this game being the Hammers’ cup final, noise which quietened when West Ham inconveniently reached and won an actual cup final while Spurs were languishing in trophyless banterland.",
      "Last season’s Europa League win means that noise will return for a fixture that has a compelling history of high-level nonsense, one that has featured dramatic late winners for Spurs from names as varied as Paul Stalteri, Eric Dier and Gareth Bale, to Manuel Lanzini halting Tottenham’s bid to put the pressure on Chelsea in 2017 and more recent match-winning exploits from Michail Antonio and Jesse Lingard.",
      "West Ham haven’t lost at home to Tottenham since 2019, when Jose Mourinho’s first game in charge of Spurs produced a chaotic 3-2 win that was in no way whatsoever a sign of things to come.",
      "The last three have ended in 1-1 draws, and even that would be enough to give West Ham something to work with moving forward. Which really didn’t look likely after those two miserable opening defeats and pitiful Carabao exit.",

      "They then fell off, bobbed around a bit and last year, as Portsmouth finally dragged themselves back up into the Championship, Southampton tumbled back into it after the second worst Premier League season in history.",

      "Andre Onana is the latest Erik ten Hag signing to leave under Manchester United head coach Ruben Amorim, with the goalkeeper joining Trabzonspor on loan.",
      "People will say Amorim has created much of his own mess at Old Trafford with his tactical stubbornness and outspoken, speak-before-you-think nature in press conferences and interviews.",
      "But he is cleaning up an unholy mess left by his predecessor. A mess that was, admittedly, enabled by the Man Utd hierarchy.",
      "The new-ish Red Devils hierarchy has already made several mistakes. One was keeping Ten Hag after a worst-ever Premier League campaign in 2023/24. Another might well be picking Amorim as his replacement less than four months after his contract extension.",
      "There may be a vastly different boardroom, personnel-wise, but the same mistakes the old hierarchy made with Ten Hag have potentially been repeated with Amorim. And if his fate is the same, a club in transition could end up in an even bigger mess than the one the Portuguese inherited.",
      "READ: Amorim sent resignation warning as Rangnick the only Man Utd manager of six still standing",
      "In Ten Hag’s first summer at Man Utd, he was backed with a monstrous, club-record transfer window, spending £227million on Antony, Tyrell Malacia, Lisandro Martinez and Casemiro, while Christian Eriksen joined on a free transfer and Martin Dubravka on loan.",
      "Man Utd had their foreshadowing moments, such as the 7-0 defeat at Liverpool and the Europa League meltdown against Sevilla, but overall, it was a positive first season for Ten Hag, who guided the Red Devils to third in the Premier League, the FA Cup final, and Carabao Cup glory.",
      "The club clearly got giddy and backed Ten Hag with more of ‘his own players’. Rasmus Hojlund, Mason Mount, Andre Onana, Sofyan Amrabat, Altay Bayindir, Jonny Evans and Sergio Reguilon all joined for a combined £166million.",
      "Ten Hag was clearly obsessed with signing players he had previously managed, or at least those with Eredivisie experience.",
      "That approach was again evident in a 2024 summer full of uncertainty surrounding his future, as Matthijs de Ligt and Noussair Mazraoui were among those to move to Old Trafford.",
      "Fast forward to January 2025: Amorim is two months into the job, not being backed with heavy spending because Man Utd’s hands are tied, but supported with the signing of wing-back Patrick Dorgu — a clear sign that Sir Jim Ratcliffe and his board are buying into their head coach’s 3-4-2-1 system.",
      "Six months, two domestic cup exits, a Europa League final defeat, and a record-low 15th-place finish in the Premier League later, they did it again.",
      "Amorim was backed with an enormous transfer kitty as the club remained confident in his managerial ability and in a formation that’s still not working.",
      "But while he has been supported with new signings and patience, he has also been tasked with finding solutions for a host of underperforming players signed by his predecessor.",
      "Onana has now followed Ten Hag signings Antony and Hojlund out under Amorim’s watch.",
      "Those are three extremely expensive mistakes. There are suggestions that Ten Hag preferred other strikers, like Harry Kane, over Hojlund, but there’s no doubt the Dutchman desperately wanted Antony and Onana, both of whom he managed at Ajax.",
      "The goalkeeper situation was one Amorim wanted to address in the summer but knew it was easier said than done with more pressing issues in attack and a restricted budget.",
      "A pre-season injury suffered by Onana got the ball rolling, as Man Utd ended up signing Senne Lammens on deadline day, with the 29-year-old falling from first to third choice in just two months.",
      "Signed for a reported £47m from Inter, Onana has now joined Trabzonspor, who finished seventh in last season’s Turkish Super Lig, on a season-long loan.",
      "It’s another catastrophic transfer loss for Man Utd, who thought they were getting a world-class goalkeeper but ended up with one of the most error-prone and least commanding keepers in the club’s recent history.",

      "Amorim’s decision to publicly claim that Kobbie Mainoo will be competing with Bruno Fernandes for a starting spot this season ’caused collateral damage that the Red Devils’ top brass could have done without as they negotiated a tricky end to the summer window’.",
      "READ: Man Utd exposed by latest transfer mistake as Amorim let down amid two worrying Onana details",
      "Jason Wilcox ended up having to persuade Mainoo to stay late in the window and not pursue a loan move away from Old Trafford and it was ‘seen as a stupid and unnecessary move by Amorim, one lacking emotional intelligence and empathy with Manchester United’s history of homegrown young stars’.",

      "“It’s not the type of result which makes you think they’ll be able to build on it. That is what he needs to do; he needs to put a string of results together and maintain their form.”",
      "“They need to continue winning games, that’s how you ease the pressure.",
      "“After the international break, it’s Man City and then they’ve got Chelsea after that, so it won’t get easier. It’s very easy to start the season and before you know where you are, you’ve lost three or four games and all of a sudden you’re tumbling down the table.",

      "The deadline day arrival of Lammens permitted Man Utd to sanction Onana’s exit, though the club’s hierarchy were clearly not stern negotiators when it came to sorting the goalkeeper’s move to Turkish side Trabzonspor.",

      "The end of the interlull is upon us. Congratulations everyone.",
      "We’ve made it through, and some of us without developing a weird obsession in a national newspaper for making everything about the injured Jude Bellingham.",
      "But with a heavy diet of Premier League and European football to sustain us for the next month, and the first Sack Race casualty and replacement already in the books, the time has surely come to turn our attention once more to the deeply vital and scientific business of the Premier League Mood Rankings.",
      "Fair to say we got Newcastle a bit wrong last time. Who have we got catastrophically wrong now? Let’s find out. Newcastle’s and the other slightly less wrong mid-summer rankings are in brackets.",
      "We were baffled by the response when we had Newcastle that high less than two months ago. Fair enough, we’re less baffled now. Because what we actually were was wrong. Desperately, badly wrong.",
      "Sometimes it takes a big man to admit they’ve made a mistake. And sometimes the mistake is writing ‘No apparent need to or significant risk of selling any of their many very excellent players – most notably of course Alexander Isak’ and you are so bang to rights you have no choice but to admit you’ve f*cked it.",
      "It was hilariously soon after those fateful words that the whole Alexander Isak Saga kicked off and so dominated the final six weeks of the transfer window.",
      "The good news, at least, is that we are no longer baffled by Newcastle fans feeling down in the dumps, and that surely must lift their spirits significantly. Guys? Guys? No? Fair enough, suit yourselves.",
      "As bad as the drawn-out and bitter Isak saga was the ritual humiliations Newcastle endured in trying to source a suitable replacement, and the fact that when they eventually did in bringing Yoane Wissa to St James’ Park, it played out in such a way that they all had to look awkwardly at their shoes or abandon all semblance of self-awareness after spending the previous weeks declaring Isak’s open disloyalty had brought indelible and grave shame on him and his legacy for the rest of days.",
      "Newcastle did also manage to sign Nick Woltemade from Stuttgart, but – while we’re loathe to jump to any conclusions – we’re not sure there’s ever been a more conspicuous and desperate example of the Bundesliga Tax. Suffice to say this was one deal where Newcastle were in absolutely no danger of being hijacked or gazumped at the last by a rival bid.",
      "On the field, it’s been a largely grim start to the season. The goalless draws against Villa and Leeds exposed the already very obvious weakness in Newcastle’s squad to a sarcastic degree, while the admirable heart and fight shown with 10 men against Liverpool only ended up exposing them to the most sickening of sucker-punches.",
      "BREAKING NEWS: Actually we got it wrong on Newcastle and they are ‘absolutely buzzing’.",
      "",
      "Why are you always like this? Hmm? It feels like some kind of deep-rooted self-sabotage at this point. Managers come and go, players come and go, Wolves start the season looking absolutely sh*tbone awful.",
      "Three defeats from three for a side who really did look to have landed on something in the spring is just so dispiriting, yet so on brand.",
      "They didn’t win a Premier League game until November last season, won one of their first six in 23/24, one of their first nine in 22/23, and like this season lost the first three in 21/22.",
      "There’s a glass half-full element to this, of course, in that none of those seasons ended with actual relegation. Wolves are always apparently able to drag themselves out of the trouble they’ve created for themselves in the end.",
      "But this one feels especially galling. Most clubs outside the elite suffered player drain this summer, and Wolves were no exception with Rayan Ait-Nouri and Matheus Cunha heading to Manchester, but it still surely needn’t have become this bleak this quickly.",
      "Not for a team that was giddily winning six matches in a row, scoring 15 goals in the process, only five months ago.",
      "And yet it also feels just so predictable. That run ended any lingering relegation concerns for Wolves, but when they followed it by taking just a single point from the four remaining games of the season you already just knew how this one would begin.",
      "A maddening exercise in self-fulfilling prophecies at this point. Sure, they’ll probably be fine in the end. History tells us that.",
      "But history also tells us that a club that has had managerial changes in June 2021, October 2022, August 2023 and December 2024 might have to also make a sacrificial lamb Vitor Pereira in order to fulfil the prophecy. And that just feels like a terrible waste.",
      "",
      "There has perhaps been no individual result across the early days and weeks of this season more water-muddying than West Ham’s genuinely inexplicable 3-0 win over Nottingham Forest.",
      "It was a result that provided Mr Marinakis just enough cover to make the managerial change he – and increasingly obviously by the end even Nuno Espirito Santo himself – wanted to make at the City Ground, but what if anything does it mean for West Ham?",
      "Until then, it was all very straightforward: absolutely everything was f*cked. The team was playing football the fans hated at a stadium the fans hate under owners the fans hate and a manager whose departure already seemed to be a case of when not if.",
      "They had been slapped silly on the opening day by Sunderland, mercilessly thrashed by Chelsea, and dumped out of the Carabao by rock-bottom Wolves despite leading 2-1 going into the final 10 minutes at Molineux.",
      "A shambolic early exit from the Carabao on the back of chastening defeat to giddy promoted team and a shortcomings-exposing paddling from a title contender just appeared such classic staging posts on the road to an early managerial change that any other course of action appeared unthinkable.",
      "And then came those crazy closing minutes at the City Ground to cast doubt upon everything we thought we knew.",
      "If West Ham can follow that up with a result in their cup final on Saturday evening – and West Ham do historically reserve some of their very best nonsenses for Tottenham games – then we really won’t know what to think.",
      "",
      "We all know that league positions are decided across the entire 10 months of a season and not on the final day, but we’re all also simple creatures who love the appeal of pinning everything on that final twist of the fates.",
      "Sure, Aston Villa could have done any number of things slightly better or slightly differently at any other point of the season to ensure the final-day defeat to Manchester United didn’t end up costing them Champions League football.",
      "But they didn’t and so in the end it did. And it was such a stupid defeat, too, to such a stupid team. And the significance of its consequences are already starting to be laid bare.",
      "From Emi Martinez’s absurd red card against the team he would later unsuccessfully attempt to join to one of the more ridiculous disallowed goals we’ve ever seen in the VAR era, you have to be wilfully obtuse not to understand Villa fans’ gnawing frustration and hurt about it all.",
      "It shouldn’t necessarily have felt quite so much like a sudden jolting stop to three years of progress, and if last season taught us anything it’s that the Europa League can cover a multitude of sins, but it did feel like something ended that day.",
      "Having failed to make either Marcus Rashford or Marco Asensio’s blockbuster loan moves permanent, a slightly desperate Villa moved late in the window to throw a vast chunk of Jadon Sancho’s wages the way of a grateful Manchester United.",
      "It does rather scream of lessons not being learned at a club that continues to teeter and totter on the very brink of PSR ruin with an unsustainable wage bill.",
      "At no other club does the ranting about the unfairness of PSR feel more misplaced than Villa, who will be making all the same noise and looking anywhere but at themselves when they find themselves forced to cash in on Morgan Rogers next summer.",
      "Wild prediction time: Unai Emery won’t be at Villa Park by the time that happens. Yeah, we said it.",
      "",
      "Oh boy. The club is a mess, obviously, the team is a mess, obviously. Manchester United is now a club so consumed by banter that even when losing in the second round of the Carabao – a Carabao round where even just having to play in it while being Manchester United is already a sign of failure – to Grimsby Town isn’t the end of the banter.",
      "The revelation that Grimsby fielded an ineligible player in that tie left United in the grip of an inescapable banter prison. They had already committed the season’s most humiliating act by losing that game, and were now in a position where they either accepted that fate or looked to profit from either an expulsion or a replay. Which would arguably have been even more humiliating and would certainly have prompted even greater waves of banter.",
      "That the one saving grace of their season currently is managing to scrape past promoted Burnley 3-2 at home in a game where they tossed away two leads before having the good sense to take the third lead so late that not even they could spaff it is revealing in its own way.",
      "They are not very good, and even after spending vast sums of money after spending the last two years pleading poverty and making penny-pinching, miserly savings at the expense of ordinary employees, they are still not very good.",
      "They face Manchester City this weekend in a game that is both derby and an early-season Crisis Club play-off.",
      "And their beleaguered manager has already provided one of the season’s starkest memes by sitting playing with his little magnetic tactics board while 2-0 down. At Grimsby.",
      "Manchester United long ago stopped being the club that ruined your childhood, but through all their assorted post-Fergie struggles we’ve always just sort of blithely, unthinkingly assumed they’ll sort it all out and get back to the top one day.",
      "Just always felt like they’re simply too big for that not to happen. But as more and more time passes we find ourselves thinking that maybe they actually might not do that. This might actually be them. This might just actually be what they really are now. Quite a thought.",
      "",
      "On the field, four points from three games against Everton, Arsenal and Newcastle represents an enormously satisfactory opening to the season for any promoted team. It’s a return that sits somewhere right towards the top end of reasonable expectation for pretty much anyone outside the Big Six/Eight/Whatever from that set of games.",
      "But the mood is nowhere near as buoyant as it otherwise would be due to the unavoidable sense that Leeds and Daniel Farke were badly let down by the owners in the closing days and weeks of the window.",
      "There was some good work done early on, but the 49ers lads had made a lot of noise about setting Leeds up to truly compete in the Premier League, so to respond to Farke’s desperate yet obviously correct insistence after the final pre-interlull game that he needed two more attacking players by signing, in fact, no more attacking players has sucked all the early-season optimism out of Elland Road.",
      "Those four points have been amassed via a late and contentious penalty winner against Everton, a goalless draw against an at-the-time similarly toothless Newcastle and an in-your-place hiding from Arsenal. And it does feel rather like a blueprint has been set for Leeds games this year, one where they will be swiftly outclassed by the best and rely on everything going their way and absolutely nothing going wrong against everyone else.",
      "And the legitimate fear for fans now is that it’s all started to look like four points from those three games isn’t just a good return but an unrepeatably fortuitous one.",
      "",
      "Bournemouth are showing that good things can happen even if you lose three or four of your very best players, as long as you can keep hold of your very good manager.",
      "Brentford will, we suspect, as the season’s stagger unwinds show what happens when you lose three or four of your very best players but also what was perhaps pound-for-pound the league’s most irreplaceable manager.",
      "Even the win they have managed this season feels like one that said a lot more about the beaten Aston Villa than it did Brentford.",
      "We fear for them, we really do.",
      "",
      "Shall we be melodramatic and rule them out of the title race already? We’re very tempted to be melodramatic and rule them out of the title race already.",
      "Two defeats in the first three games of the season – neither of which came against title rivals and both of which came meekly and deservedly – is not the foundation upon which a modern title fight is built.",
      "How deep into the season will we get before Arsenal have shed six points to non-rivals? How deep before Liverpool have discarded six points to anyone?",
      "Man City are in the early days of a significant, complex and by definition difficult regeneration. But these early missteps are significant and potentially costly ones already, on the back of what was by the lofty standards Pep Guardiola has set a catastrophic 24/25 featuring no trophy of any kind and no meaningful sustained tilt at either of the big prizes.",
      "City’s and Pep’s pedigree means they do deserve to be cut more slack than others. Even his very best City teams were always (even) better at the end of a season than its beginning. There is, very, very obviously a vast amount of time for things to change.",
      "But this new-look City team is just so visibly a very early work in progress, and we remain wildly unconvinced the manager has the energy or inclination to see that progress through.",
      "READ: Amorim and United should smell City blood before Manchester derby",
      "",
      "One win, two defeats. That’s a start to the season most promoted teams would take, we reckon. And there was a fair bit of encouragement even in those defeats.",
      "The late heartbreak at Manchester United was brutal, but just being that close to that kind of away point this early in the season isn’t nothing. And even in the 3-0 opening-day defeat at Spurs, there were lengthy spells in the 55 minutes of play between Richarlison’s two goals – the second of which is an early goal-of-the-season contender – where Burnley were the better side and an equaliser appeared on the cards.",
      "But it’s still a start that comes with concerns and caveats. Their one win was against a fellow promoted side, and shipping three goals in both the games against established Premier League sides is a stark early reminder that ‘we will simply concede no goals’ was never likely to be as effective a survival tool as it was a promotion one.",
      "Burnley have already conceded only one goal fewer in the Premier League this calendar year than they did in the Championship. And their next three Premier League games are against Liverpool, a newly Angeballin’ Nottingham Forest, and Manchester City.",

      "Even in the very simplest terms of being what it took to keep Glasner at the helm. They might have muddled through okay until January following the loss of Guehi, but there really wouldn’t have been a transfer fee imaginable that could have made up for losing Glasner with the season under way.",
      "And we don’t have Glasner down as the sort to make hasty idle threats. If reports he threatened to walk are accurate, then he meant it.",
      "The atmosphere is likely to be testy for a while now, we’d imagine. There are a few relationships that need some strains sorting out. But there’s also the chance for Palace to win an extremely winnable European trophy this season, and for Guehi to lift it as his final act for the club. What a thing that would be.",

      "They are a football team that almost never gets beyond phase two of any new, shiny project. Constantly starting over, forever regenerating. Forever in transition.",

      "Thomas Frank is the 13th permanent manager Tottenham have appointed in the 21st century. It’s a relevant timeframe for more than just brain-pleasing round-number reasons.",
      "Frank was also the 13th and we now know last managerial appointment of Daniel Levy’s reign as Tottenham chairman.",
      "And that means that while yes, this is a club well used to constant churn, chop and change, this is still nevertheless a time of even greater flux and uncertainty.",
      "Because for the last 25 years, there behind it all has been Levy, a rare executive chair in a world of non-execs and CEOs.",
      "With his departure, the sands shift once again beneath Tottenham’s feet. There is huge celebration among plenty of fans who had grown tired and increasingly frustrated by Levy’s supposed penny-pinching and inability or unwillingness to make the sort of transfer splash – and thus accept not always getting the best possible price for every incoming and outgoing – that might allow them a fighting chance at achieving his stated goals of winning one of the two big prizes.",
      "There are others who are wary of the change, more appreciative of the work Levy did to transform Spurs from mid-table sleeping giant into a member of the Big Six. The idea that Levy has been great for Spurs off the pitch but disastrous for them on the pitch has always been a loud and compelling one, with plenty of reasonable frustrations underpinning it.",
      "But it’s also worth remembering that Spurs had been mostly crap on the pitch for most of the 90s having pretty emphatically missed the Premier League Boat they as a club did so much to help launch.",
      "The Spurs Levy leaves is unrecognisable – literally and figuratively – from the one he joined.",

      "The abruptness and timing of Levy’s departure was a surprise, but in truth we should all have seen it coming. There have been plenty of signs, from Levy himself and around him.",
      "His new-found willingness to front up both for in-house interviews and with Gary Neville on The Overlap hinted at a man who suddenly, for the first time, felt it necessary to try and explain himself. There have been new arrivals that, in hindsight, always looked like they could be used to ease Levy out. Long-time Lewis confidant Peter Charrington – now in position as non-executive chairman – came to the club six months ago, followed by former Arsenal man Vinai Venkatesham.",
      "He is now the CEO and will be the closest thing to a replacement for Levy in the new, more standard structure.",
      "There is a very valid argument that Levy had taken Spurs as far as he possibly could. That everything he had achieved in repositioning the club as a 21st century behemoth off the field would never be replicated on the field while he remained wedded to retaining the Premier League’s lowest wage:turnover ratio.",
      "It might very well be a change that had to happen. Spurs might now compete more robustly in the transfer market with the rest of the Big Six, and are perhaps now in less danger of being instead swallowed up by Aston Villa and Newcastle and other upwardly-mobile members of the Premier League’s middle-classes.",
      "But it might also go catastrophically wrong, something that can never be entirely ruled out at Spurs.",

      "That’s not really the model Chelsea are now pursuing. They will have good teams and good squads and the ensuing on-field success, but that feels more and more like a by-product of the primary business. Which is player trading.",
      "What Clearlake have done is taken what was the necessary evil of player trading and made it the core business. And it’s worth noting that all they’ve actually done is to just go further along a path Roman Abramovich had already started down.",
      "Chelsea now acquire players the way other businesses acquire assets. They might be useful to the side-hustle of trying to win football matches, they might not. It’s almost stopped mattering – to the business, if not the fans.",
      "The long contracts Chelsea tie their players down to are something we were all guilty of misunderstanding in the early stages. They weren’t just a ruse to help with amortisation but that would ultimately stitch them up down the line; they were key to the whole caper.",
      "If you’re signing players as tradeable assets, it’s no use if they’re just going to be available for free four years later.",
      "Sure, you’re going to run into problems with this approach from time to time and end up paying Raheem Sterling £300k a week to train with the youth team, but in the main what Chelsea are doing is protecting the resale value of every player they sign.",
      "It’s already visible on the balance sheet. The absurd front-end outlays and selling-hotels-to-themselves machinations of the early windows have gone. They have pretty much broken even this window despite another vast outlay running into the hundreds of millions.",
      "They’ll take a loss here and there, but they make a profit in the round, and every now and then accidentally sign a Cole Palmer who turns out to be a generational talent, so that’s nice.",
      "It’s also why blasting players for perceived lack of loyalty is only becoming more and more futile. You can shake your head sadly at Viktor Gyokeres or Alexander Isak doing what they did to ‘get their move’ but Gyokeres was entirely right to point out that this is a two-way street and clubs show no loyalty of their own to players they no longer want.",
      "It’s not a pleasant reality, but this is 2025. We don’t do pleasant realities any more.",
      "Chelsea’s multi-club structure helps provide further space to accommodate all the players they acquire, and potential shop windows via loans. And Chelsea know the reality of football right now and the sheer scale of the Premier League’s financial heft means there will (almost) always be takers when it’s deemed time to cash in.",
      "We’re already at a stage where even Bayern Munich aren’t above rummaging around in Chelsea’s garbage and handing over eye-watering sums for the privilege.",
      "It’s not the transfer model football needs, but it is the transfer model football deserves. One where players are treated not like athletes or even human beings but simply another commodity to be bought and sold.",
      "Even 74 charges brought by the FA cannot dim their light.",
      "",
      "We’ve actually delayed publication on this by a couple of days just to be sure of accurately reflecting the prevailing mood at Forest because we weren’t at all certain what it would be.",
      "Giddy and chipper would appear to be that prevailing thought after they sacked the manager who took them to Europe and replaced him with the manager who finished 10 points and 27 points behind them last season.",
      "Which we’d argue is an unusual response to such a scenario. But we’re being facetious, of course. Because Ange Postecoglou is a manager who inevitably prompts giddiness. It is very intoxicating as an idea, is Angeball.",
      "The obvious fear, of course, is that we’ve already seen what happens to it after extended exposure to the harsh glare of Premier League reality. And that was with a far more suitable squad.",
      "We’ve already made the point elsewhere that going for Ange at this delicate stage of their encouraging development as an improving Premier League side might prove a damagingly hubristic act, with the mischievous thought that of the two wild high-profile appointments that appealed to Mr Marinakis it really might be that Jose Mourinho was the less damaging.",
      "It really is hard to imagine more directly opposite methods than Nuno’s tight, compact, controlled football that had worked so well and Postecoglou’s chaos. And it’s also worth remembering that the times when Forest did come unstuck last season were often on the occasions when they tried to move away from or beyond what was working so well.",
      "But the squad isn’t entirely unsuited to Ange’s ways, especially the attacking players. It does also feel like it will make or quite literally break Elliot Anderson as an elite all-round midfielder.",
      "It’s the defence that we worry about, though. We suspect Oleksandr Zinchenko possesses the nous and technical quality to work quite well as a Pedro Porro-style full-back-No 10 hybrid, but nothing about the rest of that defence screams ‘set up camp on the halfway line’.",
      "There’s nothing wrong with a managerial change providing such a stark shift in style. It’s often, by definition, precisely what was needed. But it can also be an indicator of chaos, of uncertainty, of a lack of overall clarity in vision.",
      "We’re not saying for sure which one this is. Just that September is the worst possible month to attempt such a shift. And it’s not like Nuno has been removed because of his on-field methods.",

      "It was a reminder that however carried away any of us get, football really is never more than the most important of all the unimportant things and there was amid the horror of it all something undeniably reassuring about the way, even in the deepest midst of football’s unending and impossible tribal culture ways, a significant break in hostilities took place.",
      "We do, though, just as vividly remember thinking at the time that people saying this would represent a fundamental long-lasting shift in how football fans spoke and treated each other were always going to be well wide of the mark.",
      "And sure enough, two months later, everything’s gone back pretty much exactly to the way it was before, with the esteemed F365 Mailbox coming in recent weeks to be thoroughly dominated by other fans telling Liverpool they are buying the league and we thought you hated that, and Liverpool fans replying in their definitely not-rattled masses to explain why it’s different, actually.",
      "Nature is healing. And you know what? We think on balance we really wouldn’t have it any other way. Sure, we don’t all need to be going around being horrible to each other all the time, but at the same time football fandom isn’t and shouldn’t be some sanitised and pleasant thing. The rivalries, the needle, the niggle are all part of it. When done rightly, like for instance arguing relentlessly about net spend.",
      "One because it makes it slightly less likely they just run away with the league because let’s face it all of us without a dog in the fight would quite like a proper title race again please, but also because it already looks set to make Liverpool even more entertaining to watch even if they do run away with it again.",
      "There is a vulnerability to them that wasn’t there last season, and the fact it might not even actually matter at all is sensational.",
      "They are a new-look team that very clearly hasn’t fully bedded in yet, have vast scope for improvement, have already had those potential defensive flaws alarmingly exposed by Bournemouth and a 10-man Newcastle side who haven’t managed to score another goal anywhere else all season.",
      "And yet they’ve also won three games out of three, including a vital early three points against the team that looks like their biggest and very possibly only meaningful rival.",
      "So it’s going quite well, is what we’re saying here. Just maybe take a deep breath and get some fresh air the next time someone tries to bait you with the ‘buying the league’ stuff. It will never matter how righteous and valid ‘but net spend’ is as a response for any club; it always just sounds whiny.",

      "As well as the nature of the wins, the identity of the opposition is also just so important. They really could be perfect wins, providing both the confidence of belonging at this level by coming against a pair of established Premier League sides, yet also being six-pointer successes against teams that could absolutely be holding the Black Cats above the dropzone when everything starts to get properly real further down the line.",

The only real tangible thing to build this doom-laden scenario upon is a lack of depth at centre-back, but still we keep coming back to the question: what if all those exciting new attacking players turn out to be massive disaster-flops?",
      "Most of our brain thinks they probably won’t f*ck it and might even be better than last season, but even that tiny idiot part convinced of pending disaster doesn’t think it could possibly materialise quickly or dramatically enough for Slot to be in any kind of danger before at least one other poor sod has been given the hook elsewhere.",

      "Especially as Spurs’ environment is… not like that one. He’s going to have a big job on to sort out an awful lot of mess at history’s funniest ever Champions League qualifiers. He appeared to have already thoroughly De-Anged the lot of them only for them to then turn up against Bournemouth and defend like an Ange team while attacking like a Mourinho one.",
      "You know who else won their first couple of games, including one against Man City, after stepping up to Spurs from a smaller but less daft Premier League club? That’s right. But while the Nuno comparisons are obvious, and a world in which Frank doesn’t make the November international break entirely possible, it doesn’t quite feel like the same situation.",
      "Crucially, there has been no undignified scramble to find a new manager this time. Whatever your thoughts on the timing and manner of Ange Postecoglou’s sacking and the identity of his replacement, it’s also clear Spurs have got the man they wanted in a way they very obviously didn’t when Nuno came in.",
      "That surely buys Frank a bit of time even if things do get hairy. Enough at least for someone else to get canned before he does. Probably.",
      "The fact the squad has not (yet) had anything like the summer renovations it required also cuts both ways here, we fancy. Frank clearly wants a few more bodies in, but their absence means he is less likely to be first in line if and when fans start dishing out blame. That is likely to once again be Gary Neville’s new best mate, especially after the Eze Fiasco and despite the Xavi Redemption.",

      "Victory over Sunderland was an impressive and necessary reminder that it might still be enough against teams more on their level, but Parker will still need some fairly early evidence it can also work against established Premier League teams, which makes Burnley’s start so problematic and that win over Sunderland both vital yet potentially deceptive.",
      "There were encouraging signs before late heartbreak against eternally stupid Manchester United, but Burnley must now face Liverpool, Forest, Manchester City and Aston Villa before the first weekend of October is out. And Parker may well be too, ideally after a 9-0 defeat against Liverpool that he regards as unavoidable.",

      "Just a slightly less clear-cut version of Glasner really. Not about to be sacked, but could be in the frame for a poaching. And if that poaching comes from outside the Premier League, then he could technically be the first manager to go.",
      "",
      "Missing out on the Champions League in the manner they did was definitely a p*sser, and while Villa were perfectly good last season, it was one that felt a bit flat in the end. It was good, but it could have been great. They could have finished in the top five. They could have won the FA Cup. They could even have knocked out PSG in the Champions League after thar barnstorming Villa Park comeback.",
      "These annoyances are real and meaningful, and this season is off to a troubling start. But it’s still hard to see how they could possibly translate to Emery being in anything like the sort of bother that put him at risk of being out on his ear in the early months of the season. The latter months of the season? Could be a different tale there.",
      "",
      "The continuity candidate, but how much continuity can there be at Brentford given they’ve sold Bryan Mbeumo and Christian Norgaard, while Thomas Frank took most of the remaining coaching staff with him to Tottenham? It’s a very Brentford move to promote from within but will they be forced into the very un-Brentford move of sacking him in October when the Bees are in a relegation battle?",
      "A win over an Aston Villa side in the midst of their own funk certainly buys some time. At the very least it surely pushes any real sack talk firmly beyond the first international break, and this season that really might be enough to make you third or fourth manager out at worst.",
      "",
      "Feels both absurdly high to be on this list before a ball is kicked, yet also perfectly fair. Postecoglou’s football is high-risk, high-reward and the larger body of Premier League evidence does now point to it being quite dramatically and fundamentally flawed at this level.",
      "And that was when he was deploying it with a Spurs squad far better suited to the approach than Nottingham Forest’s, especially in terms of defensive pace, mobility and technical ability.",
      "While it’s all smiles now between Postecoglou and Marinakis, it’s really not that hard to imagine a world where that all changes very, very quickly.",
      "",
      "",
      "It would have made Spurs’ decision to sack Europa League-winning Ange Postecoglou look positively kind, but there remains a decent case that Leeds – and Burnley for that matter – could or even should have thanked the managers who secured 100 Championship points and got them back into the big time and then sent them on their way.",
      "Farke had a dreadful Premier League record of only six wins and 26 points from his 49 games in charge of Norwich, a team he twice led to promotion from the Championship with 94 and 97 points.",
      "As well as fighting his own record in this competition, Farke faces the added burden of expectation levels very different to those at just about any other club that could possibly find itself promoted into the Premier League in this current era where that represents the most bittersweet of successes.",
      "Leeds do look far better prepared than most for attempting the now fiendishly difficult first-season survival at this time, as victory over a disappointingly passive Everton suggested, but Farke lasted 11 games of the 21/22 season with Norwich and something similar absolutely cannot be ruled out this time.",
      "Arsenal away needn’t be a season-defining fixture, but Leeds had absolutely nothing to offer in that one from the moment the Gunners got going, which doesn’t bode well for future games against teams who aren’t as confused as Everton apparently are.",
      "Leeds were quietly impressive in a goalless draw against a despair-laden Newcastle, but the lack of goal threat is inevitably a concern.",
      "",
      "Won’t be sacked, obviously, because Palace are absolutely punching with an elite-level manager who is quietly delivering astonishing results in trying circumstances.",
      "But with reports he was willing and ready to walk out if Marc Guehi was sold without a replacement point to new strains on a relationship that is bound to be tested in the weeks and months ahead.",
      "Nailed it in the Community Shield, but as ever for clubs on Palace’s level there’s a positive-and-negative scale to be balanced by your manager catching the eye so conspicuously. Glasner absolutely could be poached with bigger beasts surely paying attention to the work he’s done at Selhurst Park.",
      "And if that poaching comes from outside the Premier League, then it comes with the possibility of making Glasner the next Premier League managerial casualty. But still very unlikely.",
      "The nerves at Selhurst Park will really kick in if/when Ruben Amorim gets the tin tack.",
      "",
      "Wolves absolutely love a sh*tbone awful start and enforced managerial change around November. The loss of key players and a disappointingly limp finish to last season after that thrilling run of wins through March and April mean those old doubts were nagging away even before a woeful pre-season, an opening-day paddling from new-look, old-destructiveness Man City and further defeats to Bournemouth and Everton.",
      "Pereira should be fine after the work he did in steering Wolves so comfortably clear of any relegation trouble last season, but making terrible starts that leave them in apparent relegation trouble before surviving comfortably in the end appears to now be ingrained in the club culture, an issue that transcends players and managers.",
      "",
      "That’s what a 3-0 defeat to a newly-promoted club and a 5-1 battering by Chelsea will do to you after a summer where little has gone right for West Ham. Sunderland and Chelsea were both very good, but the Hammers were honking on the opening day and arguably even worse against the Blues, with the perfectly rational view that Potter could not and should not be judged until he’d had the chance to get a pre-season’s worth of ideas across to his players already floundering.",
      "Hard to think of many teams who’ve more thoroughly propelled themselves into full ‘You fear for them’ territory so early in the season.",
      "But that victory over Forest, coming as it did with Lucas Paqueta’s don’t-come-and-get-me plea was impeccably timed. It would’ve been an unmanageable international break void had they lost that, even if Potter is far from out of the woods just yet.",
      "",
      "Feels like one could, if one were so inclined, make the case for him being both top and bottom of this list.",
      "Top because United were staggeringly and at times unwatchably bad last season, as well as bottling the Europa League final in truly dismal fashion against planet earth’s most notorious pot-dodgers. Bottom because United have so clearly and determinedly nailed their colours to the Amorim mast that even if they remain staggeringly and at times unwatchably awful they might just stick with him out of pure stubbornness.",
      "But can he survive defeat to Grimsby Town? Should he? Victory over Burnley helps, but it could scarcely have been less convincing.",
      "READ: Who will be the next Man Utd manager if Ruben Amorim is sacked?",
      "Man Utd head coach Ruben Amorim has confirmed that Altay Bayindir will start ahead of Senne Lammens against Man City in the Manchester Derby on Sunday.",

      "The showing of faith from Amorim comes after Andre Onana's season-long loan move to Trabzonspor was confirmed and the club completed a deadline-day move for Senne Lammens.",
      "The 27-year-old was easily barged out of the way of the ball as Ricardo Calafiori scored the only goal in Arsenal's 1-0 victory at Old Trafford, despite a dominant United display on the opening day. Bayindir was also flung into the spotlight when he parried the ball into the path of Jaidon Anthony during United's 3-2 win over Burnley last time out.",
      "His performances led to some calls from fans to see Lammens given the nod for the derby; however, Amorim maintains that the club will be feeding players in differently to ensure players thrive at the club.",
      "\"It's not just the pressure of Manchester United, but it's a different club,\" Amorim said.",
      "\"We are building stability at the club to make new players better. If you go back into the past, this club had a really good base with Roy Keane, Gary Neville, all of these types of guys, but I remember world-class players like [Juan-Sebastián] Veron had problems.",
      "\"We had a situation in the past with goalkeepers where we spent a lot of time trying to get a goalkeeper and then Edwin van der Sar came and was like a different player in that position.",
      "\"It's not something that is happening now. It's happening now because we cannot win a lot of titles and that adds more pressure to every player, but we've had these kind of moments at this kind of club.",
      "\"We will try to build stability and a base to help all of these players and we are building that. So in this moment, it's really hard for different players to adapt to this club.\"",
      "Asked who the club's next Van der Sar is, Amorim said:",
      "\"This week I hope to see Altay Bayindir doing well like Van der Sar. Then in the future, they have to fight for the places. We as a team can help the goalkeepers be better. We are doing that.\"",
      "Amorim says it was the right time for both the club and Onana to part ways.",
      "Onana, like Bayindir, was beaten to the ball easily as Grimsby doubled their lead over Man Utd in normal time before United fought back to reach a penalty shootout.",
      "United ultimately lost that game, but Amorim denies the notion that the game influenced Onana's loan departure.",
      "\"Sometimes things are not working in some environments, some moments.",
      "\"I think we, as a club, and Andre felt it was a moment to do a little change. We don't know the future, but it was time to change Onana.",
      "\"You look at the moment and the performance, it's not about Onana's last game, but you can feel the environment. We felt it was a good moment to make a change in that position.\"",
      "Amorim also believes that after the transfer window, he can see more things in the team that he likes. United signed the likes of Bryan Mbeumo, Matheus Cunha and Benjamin Sesko, who helped take Man Utd's spending to £232.4m.",
      "Outgoings included Marcus Rashford, Rasmus Hojlund and Jadon Sancho, who secured loan moves elsewhere and permanent departures for Antony and Alejandro Garnacho. Amorim believes his side are better and that owes to losing the Europa League final, which means fewer games and more time on the training pitch.",
      "\"It's going to take time, but we are better,\" Amorim said.",
      "\"I can see more things in my team that I like. More of the things I don't like in my [current] team are more mental because I know the quality is there. We proved in different weekends.\"",
      "\"I think it's hard for the fans, people and some pundits to understand because the Europa League win would have brought us more money to spend and change a lot of things in the team and more games to rotate the team for more players to be happy, but I think we need time.",
      "\"So for me it was the best thing about losing the final, if there can be a best thing. It was time to improve not just the team but also the club.",
      "\"We've shown that a little bit in the games, we play better, we are more dominant, we create more chances, we avoid more chances from the opponent. We are going to use every minute to improve our base. To have our way of playing to be ready for the adaptation, for them to understand every detail of their positions.",
      "Now we have a full week to have a schedule and show the mistakes and now you are showing what you did well in the last game. Now we have more days to focus on the strategy for the next game.\"",

      "Manchester City and Manchester United have a rebuild on their hands, but, despite indifferent starts, have they shown signs of promise going into the new season?;the Manchester derby takes place at the Etihad, live on Sky this Sunday, with kick-off at 4.30pm",
      "Friday 12 September 2025 17:02, UK",
      "The winds of change are sweeping through Manchester.",
      "Manchester City and Manchester United meet at the Etihad on Sunday as the validity of their respective rebuilds continues to be scrutinised.",
      "For the first time in four seasons, the Premier League trophy is in a different home. Tasked with bringing back what has been City's on six of the last eight occasions is Pep Guardiola, but he is in uncomfortable territory.",
      "United are all too familiar with the promise of a rebuild. Ruben Amorim represents the sixth permanent time of asking for a manager at the Old Trafford club to restore the glories of the past.",
      "While for Guardiola, after nine years - his longest spell at a club - he navigates another reboot to restore more recent success, for the first time in his managerial career.",
      "Still yet to provide proof that his footballing concepts can bear fruit, Amorim, on the other hand, must convince fans that a record low finish of 15th in the Premier League was a blip in his first full season at the helm.",
      "United have made an indifferent start to the new season. There was a sense of positivity despite defeat in the season opener to Arsenal. Old habits crept in as United gave away a lead at Fulham and Carabao Cup embarrassment at League Two Grimsby wearied both fans and Amorim himself of whether he could continue as the boss.",
      "After the penalty shoot-out defeat at Grimsby, the Portuguese boss suggested \"something had to change\", implying that it could not be the players, leaving the door open to speculation over his future. Days later, Amorim backtracked on his comments, putting them down to emotion, explaining, \"sometimes I want to quit, sometimes I want to be here for 20 years\".",
      "That frustration perhaps could be borne out of the fact that United are doing the right things but are lacking the results and points to reflect their improvements. United have only scored one goal from open play this season, but the underlying numbers appear much more favourable for United.",
      "It is very early on in the season, but Amorim's side have generated the most expected goals, have had the most shots and created the most chances in the Premier League so far this term, reflecting a freer, flowing attack.",
      "United have also hit the post four times across their three opening fixtures as their new-look forward line attempts to improve on their return.",
      "Incomings in the form of Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo have made for a more expressive United in forward areas, but there has also been a greater emphasis on a more direct style with United also leading the Premier League in long passes completed.",
      "Signs of improvement extend to United's newly-found willingness to battle, a side of their game that has often been criticised. Only one side has bettered United this season when it comes to duels won and aerial duels won.",
      "Amorim will be desperate for his side's promising numbers to translate into victories. United's win over Burnley before the break was a much-needed one but the Manchester derby offers further opportunity to reflect proof of concept.",
      "Guardiola is the only current manager that Amorim has faced more than once in the Premier League while remaining undefeated.",
      "Amorim beat Guardiola twice during the 2024/25 season, the first as he led Sporting to a 4-1 victory in the Champions League days before taking up his post at Old Trafford. Amad then sealed a late comeback win for Amorim at the Etihad last December. The Manchester derby ended goalless when the two last met in April.",
      "City's unprecedented dip in form last season pushed the club into uncharted territory. Their lowest points total under Guardiola in a trophyless campaign last term prompted a summer rebuild. But their woes have dripped into the new season with Guardiola making his worst start to a league campaign since 2008.",
      "Kevin De Bruyne's departure signalled a new era at the Etihad. Summer signings James Trafford, Gianluigi Donnarumma, Rayan Cherki, Rayan Ait-Nouri and Tijjani Reijnders added to January acquisitions of Abdukodir Khusanov, Vitor Reis and Omar Marmoush, among others to create a new-look City under a new director of football, Hugo Viana.",
      "However, with just one win on the table in the Premier League so far, the 'new Man City' have made a stuttering start.",
      "Changes to the technical staff appear to have had some impact. Former Liverpool assistant Pep Ljinders has joined Guardiola in the dugout alongside Kolo Toure. Lijnders, Jurgen Klopp's former right-hand man, was famed for his part in Liverpool's dynamic, high-octane approach.",
      "Jamie Carragher, after City's resounding opening victory at Wolves, noted City's \"rock-and-roll\" approach, akin to Klopp's Liverpool.",
      "\"It felt like in the game, it's almost like a little bit of an obsession, certainly in the first half, about catching them offside,\" Carragher said on Monday Night Football.",
      "\"We always know Pep's team like to push up. We get all that, but that was something a little bit different. It just makes me think of the influence of Pep Lijnders in terms of the offside.",
      "\"When you think of Liverpool as well, keeping back to Pep Lijnders, the amount of counter-attacking goals that Liverpool team would score with [Sadio] Mane and [Mohammed] Salah, breaking forward. When I looked at the goal from Reinders in the game. It was fantastic.",
      "\"But one of the goals was what you'd think of as a counter-attack, not maybe a Pep Guardiola goal. They win it, and then they're off.\"",
      "A change in approach has been evident. With Cherki now involved and the reintroduction of Oscar Bobb, there has been a slightly greater emphasis on individual flair, with City having completed the most take-ons of any side in the Premier League.",
      "Despite Rodri returning to fitness, City appear to have struggled to control games, giving up their lead over Brighton and being blown away by Thomas Frank's rampant Tottenham. It is that perceived lack of control that will be bothering Guardiola the most ahead of the derby.",
      "United head into the derby above City for the first time in five years, but that does not remove the feeling of trepidation that surrounds Old Trafford at the moment.",
      "The added context of key City absentees in the form of Marmoush and Cherki will offer confidence. As will Amorim's record against Guardiola and City's only win in their last four meetings, being the Community Shield shoot-out victory last season.",
      "Derby games are the proverbial great leveller, but when both sides have been equally uninspiring in terms of results, it becomes a must-win for both managers that could be indicative of the validity of their rebuilds.",

      "No goalkeeper made more saves in Europe's top 10 leagues last season during his 30 appearances in the Belgian Pro League. He also had one of the highest goals-prevented metrics in Europe and made the most progressive passes for any goalkeeper under the age of 23.",

      "That quality is shot-stopping. City have faced 15 shots on target across the opening three games, the most of any side in the top flight, meaning Donnarumma's strength in this area will be welcomed with open arms by Guardiola and his staff.",
      "United lead the league in shots taken so far this season (56) and come in at second behind Liverpool for shots on target (15). Right now, City need a goalkeeper to address that threat. Donnarumma is the perfect option.",
      "His ability on the ball and other topics of debate are a discussion for another day.",
      "On the other hand, you could argue Trafford deserves the opportunity to impress in the derby.",
      "He enjoyed a steady start to his return to City, two years after leaving the club to join Burnley, having kept a clean sheet in the season opener against Wolverhampton Wanderers.",
      "However, a major error against Tottenham leading to the second goal of the afternoon during a 2-0 defeat, as well as another loss to Brighton and Hove Albion, has cast an unwanted spotlight on the 22-year-old.",
      "\"He is a keeper for Man City. I can only play one keeper,\" Guardiola added on Trafford now facing competition from Donnarumma.",
      "Despite the error and the new arrival, Trafford can still stake his claim to remain between the sticks for City.",
      "Only Guglielmo Vicario has made more saves than the City 'keeper across the opening three games, while he also comes in at second for goals prevented in the top flight.",
      "Trafford is a solid shot-stopper, capable of the extraordinary, as his tipped save against Brighton showed.",
      "Donnarumma could provide healthy and high-quality competition for the academy graduate, rather than displacing him immediately.",

      "Our football betting expert and top tipster Jones Knows is back to preview all 10 Premier League games with a 4/1 double on his radar.",
      "You couldn't get a more seismic shift in football philosophy from the pragmatism and safety of Nuno Espirito Santo to Ange Postecoglou's front-foot philosophy.",
      "It's a wild appointment from Forest, one showered with risk.",
      "There will be teething problems, especially at the heart of the defence.",
      "Nuno's centre-backs, often protected by a double pivot and narrow shape, were rarely exposed to isolation or high-line races. They weren't expected to be part of the attack, they were there to clear, block and survive. It's what made Nikola Milenkovic and Murillo such an imposing duo last season.",
      "However, Postecoglou doesn't just want control, he wants chaos. The press is high and aggressive. The defensive line creeps ever closer to halfway and centre-backs are no longer shielded - they become part of the plan in possession.",
      "Milenkovic and Murillo are going to take time to adapt which means their prices to be carded offer great value while being caught out of possession is going to be extremely likely. Both are 3/1 with Sky Bet to pick up a booking.",
      "This should be full of goals.",
      "Bournemouth press relentlessly, commit bodies forward in numbers, and play with almost a disregard for defensive structure that leaves their centre-backs asked to do lots of one-on-one work. It's high-risk, high-reward football that leads to goals at both ends when the opposition can hurt them. Brighton are the perfect dance partner in that regard with their last 16 away games in all competitions averaging 3.88 goals per game.",
      "The over 3.5 goals line is on offer at 13/8 with Sky Bet and that looks a price to take seriously.",
      "Oliver Glasner is arguably one of the best pound-for-pound managers in world football and his skills are going to be tested over the next few weeks to keep Palace moving forward. Eberechi Eze has gone while Ismaila Sarr and Adam Wharton are both set to be out for this one.",
      "One player who could take advantage of opportunities is Justin Devenny and if you're digging around the player shots market this weekend, him to have a shot on target at 4/5 with Sky Bet rates as a juicy price. With injuries forcing Glasner to shuffle his pack, Devenny looks set to be handed a more attacking remit and he does love to shoot as outlined by his 2.65 shots per 90 data from his appearances for Palace so far.",
      "There was a time when backing goals in an Everton game felt like throwing cash into a firepit. In recent years with Sean Dyche at the helm the football has been functional, efficient and predictable.",
      "They've been an under-goals gamblers dream.",
      "How times have changed though. Everton are now opening up the game. And the arrival of Jack Grealish has added the kind of attacking intent and tempo that's turning David Moyes' team into a great watch. Backing goals in their games looks to be a sweet spot of value to attack as the markets are sleeping and holding too much emphasis on the Dyche days.",
      "Over 2.5 goals here at Evens is one of the best punts of the weekend.",
      "Opposition centre-backs beware - there's a foul drawing supremo playing as the Leeds centre-forward. And as bettors we must try and take advantage of this edge when assessing the player fouls markets.",
      "Lukas Nmecha isn't renowned as a regular goalscorer but what he does do well is the dirty work needed from a striker. He wins fouls, he's good at the dark arts.",
      "Across his last 50 appearances, he's drawing 3.1 fouls per 90 and has drawn four fouls in his first two starts for Leeds. These types of markets rarely adjust foul lines for defenders based on the specific forward they're facing, so there's an angle to exploit here with Joachim Andersen's price of 5/2 with Sky Bet to make two or more fouls standing out.",
      "This stinks of a Newcastle to win to nil betting opportunity at 13/10 with Sky Bet.",
      "Eddie Howe's side may not get the plaudits they deserve for defensive organisation, but this is a team drilled to an elite level. Despite a tough fixture list of Aston Villa, Liverpool and Leeds, Newcastle have managed the best expected goals against process of any team this season, offering up just 1.58 worth of chances. They've also faced the fewest shots (18), showcasing just how strong they are as a unit.",
      "Meanwhile, without Matheus Cunha injecting his quality and class, Wolves look like a team running out of ideas already in the final third. Boosting the raw Newcastle win price of 2/5 with Sky Bet by adding in the clean sheet looks a smart play.",
      "The narrative of Mohammed Kudus returning to West Ham following his move to Tottenham for £55m adds lots of intrigue to an already spicy London derby. Kudus is the first player to join Spurs from West Ham since Scott Parker in 2011 and - as they should - Hammers fans have taken Kudus' move very personally.",
      "He's in for a hot reception and strikes me as a character who will embrace the hostility.",
      "This makes his price of 13/8 with Sky Bet to rack up five or more foul involvements very appealing.",
      "Across his last 50 games in the Premier League playing for West Ham and Spurs, his per 90 foul involvement average is 3.75. And in his four appearances for Spurs already, he's racked up 15 foul involvements.",
      "If you just pull his foul involvement averages against the bigger clubs - in his last 15 appearances against teams that finished in the top 10 of the Premier League and PSG in the Super Cup final, the number comes in at 5.4 per 90. He can hit that average here.",
      "If Chelsea are to challenge for the Premier League title this season, these are the meat-and-drink fixtures that require a no-thrills return of maximum points.",
      "It's something they are becoming very accustomed to doing, though, as Enzo Maresca's side have won 16 of their last 19 games in all competitions. Chelsea are a very reliable team to trust. There's a calmness and control about this team now.",
      "They possess a machine-like quality, quietly getting results in matches they're expected to win. That makes them a dangerous animal for Liverpool, Arsenal and Manchester City this season.",
      "These newly-promoted teams at home are going to be bigger forces to be reckoned with than last season. Ipswich, Southampton and Leicester only won five home games between them while the new boys are already at four wins combined from just five matches.",
      "Burnley at Turf Moor can make this scrappy and fiddly for Liverpool. Scott Parker's team are unbeaten in their last 24 home league games and although that run is likely to end here, there will be positive vibes with the players likely to feed off the fact they're very used to winning games in front of their own supporters.",
      "Despite Liverpool's perfect start results-wise, it has been clear they've struggled to find their flow and that stodge may just continue for another week due to the international break limiting time on the training pitch for Arne Slot. The Reds beat Leicester, Wolves and Southampton twice across all competitions by a one-goal margin last season on the road. It's 11/4 with Sky Bet to happen again at Turf Moor.",
      "The Premier League might be back on your screen, and you're ready to go goals galore with your punting after sitting through England vs Andorra for the 32,000th time but the trends suggest this is a time in the calendar where goals drop like a stone.",
      "Players have been flying halfway across the globe and managers have had barely a day or two with their full squads.",
      "The result? Slower starts, lower intensity, fewer chances.",
      "Across the last two seasons, this matchday immediately after the international break, the average goals per game sits at a lowly 2.35 which is way down on the overall average of 3.1 per game during those two seasons.",
      "Also, of the last 40 Premier League games played immediately after the first international break, 20 of them have been 0-0 at the break and the average first half goals scored is 0.9 per game.",
      "Matches can be cagey and this one fits the bill where the market is overplaying the chances of goals. That makes the under 2.5 line at 13/8 with Sky Bet a nice edge to attack in a fixture which has only averaged 2.6 goals per game across the last 10.",
