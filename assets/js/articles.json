      "Golf and tennis correspondent. Also lots of football",
      "Instead of facing Tottenham in the Super Cup in his homeland tonight, the best shot-stopping goalkeeper in Europe is up for sale.",
      "And the signing of the giant Gianluigi Donnarumma by Chelsea or Manchester City would boost their Premier League title hopes or make Manchester United genuine Champions League candidates. The 6ft 5in stopper, with the wingspan of a 747, will have that size of impact at his next club.",
      "The Italian captain - who announced he will be leaving PSG on Tuesday - first tormented English fans by saving spot kicks from Jadon Sancho and Bukayo Saka in the Euro 2020 final penalty shootout.",
      "And the former Milan keeper, still only 26, caused heartbreak for Manchester City, Liverpool, Aston Villa and Arsenal fans as he inspired Paris Saint-Germain to their first Champions League trophy.",
      "But only 73 days after the French club’s triumph over Inter Milan - and only five days after he was the only goalkeeper named in the Ballon D’Or shortlist - Donnarumma’s career at PSG is over in ruthless fashion.",
      "While the Champions League winners flew to Udine to face the Europa Cup winners yesterday, the Italy goalkeeper trained alone at the back at the Campus PSG while the club awaits offers for his signature.",
      "Last season’s all-action hero, popular with his fellow players and fans, will not play for the Qatari-owned club again. At least Marie Antoinette had a trial before she was guillotined in Paris.",
      "Donnarumma is out of contract next summer and year-long negotiations to agree a new deal have now stopped. He signed on a free transfer from Milan in 2021 on a gross salary of €10m (£8.64m). After tax breaks and bonuses, his current net annual salary has been £6.5m.",
      "PSG are now offering players lower basic wages with more performance-related bonuses and Donarumma refused the effective pay cut despite his desire to remain in the City of Light.",
      "There was a similar standoff with Kylian Mbappe two summers ago when he refused to sign a new deal and he was excluded from a summer tour to Asia. He was reintegrated back into the group after giving up millions of Euros in bonuses and then used less after Christmas when it was clear he was still leaving for Real Madrid.",
      "This time PSG have already signed Donnarumma’s replacement. Ligue 1 Goalkeeper of the Year Lucas Chevalier joined this weekend in a €55m deal from Lille, the former club of PSG director of football Luis Campos. And the 23-year-old was bought with the backing of Luis Enrique and guaranteed he will be No.1.",
      "The PSG announcement welcoming the signing of Chevalier claimed he is: “Comfortable on his line, in one-on-one situations, and in the air, he also has excellent distribution skills”.",
      "It was interpreted by the Italian media and Donnarumma’s camp as a dig at the Azzurri keeper’s ability with his feet. Former Milan keeper Christian Abbiati told Gazzetta dello Sport: \"There's something crazy about all this. I would say he won more than half the Champions League for them. And yet, from what I hear, it seems he's bad with his feet.",
      "\"We can say that there are many players better with their feet than him, but from there to replacing a goalkeeper who has put a Champions League title in your trophy cabinet! In Europe he's made unbelievable saves, saves that few would have been capable of making.",
      "“Someone of his calibre will certainly land on his feet and go to another big club, although it's a shame he has to end like this. I wish him the best because he deserves it.\"",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Manchester United's frontline has been transformed by an impressive summer of recruitment with three new faces setting them back more than £200million.",
      "The capture of Benjamin Sesko, presented to Old Trafford on Saturday, means Ruben Amorim has addressed the lack of goals in his team last season. With the season fast approaching it is unlikely that any new faces will arrive before they play Arsenal on Sunday.",
      "However Amorim has made it clear he would like a new midfielder with Brighton's Carlos Baleba continuing to be linked with a move to Manchester. He's excelled at the Amex but, given the fee the Seagulls would demand, there's an acceptance that any deal could prove challenging.",
      "PSG's Gianluigi Donnarumma is another player who could be on the move with the Parisians leaving him out of their squad for this week's European Super Cup. PSG are open to his exit with United among those keen. Here's the latest news lines from the Red Devils.",
      "Manchester United supporters group The 1958 has pulled the plug on a planned protest. The group had planned to march against Sir Jim Ratcliffe's ownership ahead of United's opening Premier League game, against Arsenal. Their decision comes just days after Sesko joined the club. The striker signing in a deal worth up to £74m.",
      "In early August, The 1958 shared plans for a protest while claiming \"shiny new signings\" shouldn't distract from minority owner Ratcliffe's involvement. However, following a mixed response to the announcement, the group then put the plans to its membership.",
      "While the majority of those surveyed agreed Jim Ratcliffe and INEOS should be judged on what they have delivered, some 68 percent felt they deserved more time to show what they can do. In announcing the postponement of the march, The 1958 published a breakdown of the voting.",
      "The Red Devils have issued winger Antony with an ultimatum as the Brazilian attempts to secure a move to Real Betis. The club have demanded the Brazilian winger to accept a transfer offer this week or risk remaining on the sidelines at Old Trafford until January.",
      "The La Liga side want to see the former Ajax man return to the club but want to hang on until the final moments of the transfer window to close a deal with United for a loan with option or obligation to buy.",
      "But those on the red side of Manchester want to seal an exit, according to reports in Spain, and have already received offers that they would deem financially suitable and do not want to regard Betis as their only option.",
      "Robert Lewandowski has revealed that he \"said yes\" to the opportunity to move to Manchester to play under Sir Alex Ferguson - only for the move never to happen. The Barcelona star has been one of Europe's outstanding No 9s for more than a decade, but a different path may have seen him play at Old Trafford under the Scot in his final year as a manager.",
      "It was in 2012 that he gave the green light to move to Manchester from Borussia Dortmund for what would've been the final spell of Ferguson's stint in Manchester. The interest came off the back of a season where Lewandowski claimed the Bundesliga title, scoring 30 times.",
      "The Polish star told the BBC: \"To Manchester United I decided and said yes. I wanted to join Manchester United, to see Alex Ferguson.\"",

      "Gianluigi Donnarumma has put Premier League sides on red alert after announcing his departure from Paris Saint-Germain.",
      "Donnarumma has been told he doesn't have a future at PSG by manager Luis Enrique and has said goodbye in a fiery statement on Instagram. \"Unfortunately, someone has decided that I can no longer be part of the group and contribute to the team’s success,” he said. \"I am disappointed and disheartened.”",
      "Earlier in the day, Enrique had confirmed that Donnarumma had been dropped from the squad for the Super Cup against Tottenham on Wednesday night. “Donnarumma is out of the squad as it’s my own decision. I am 100 per cent responsible,\" said Enrique.",
      "“I want a different kind of goalkeeper and I made this decision. Gigio is one of the best goalkeepers in the whole world. The life of a top-level footballer, and the same goes for us coaches, is this: it wasn’t an easy decision but I take full responsibility for it.”",
      "Donnarumma is still only 26 years old and, as a European champion with Italy in 2021 and a Champions League winner with PSG in May, the goalkeeper shouldn’t be short of suitors.",
      "The most recent noises have been coming out of the Etihad, where Pep Guardiola is said to have a soft spot for Donnarumma. There has been a lot of movement in the goalkeeping department at City this summer, with rumours of a possible departure for Ederson to Galatasaray followed by the club re-signing James Trafford for £31m from Burnley.",
      "Late on Tuesday night came news, via L’Equipe, that Donnarumma had agreed personal terms with City. The Italy international is understood to be very keen on a move to City, who will now have to negotiate a fee with PSG.",
      "By making their desire to offload Donnarumma public and promote new keeper Lucas Chevalier, PSG have backed themselves into a corner, yet reportedly value him at £43million.",
      "Donnarumma’s contract expires in less than a year so City will surely try to negotiate that fee downwards. His arrival would surely mean the end to Ederson’s eight-year stay at the club and would mean Trafford once again taking a backseat at his boyhood club.",
      "Question marks over the form of Andre Onana at United have been a constant almost ever since his arrival from Ajax – and things came to a head last season. Ruben Amorim was forced to take Onana out of the firing line after a mistake-filled performance against Lyon in the Europa League, but his replacement Altay Bayindir was no better.",
      "United reportedly contacted Aston Villa to enquire about the availability of Emi Martinez earlier this summer, while they have also been linked with Royal Antwerp’s Senne Lammens.",
      "Donnarumma has always appeared to be an ambitious target, given United’s lack of European football and 15th-placed finish last season. The club have distanced themselves from a move for him, which would seem unlikely anyway.",
      "One problem is United’s lack of available funds. Donnarumma fell out with PSG after demanding a bumper new contract and United would need to offload some of their unwanted players before adding to their £200m summer spending spree. Jadon Sancho and Alejandro Garnacho are their most valuable assets in that regard.",
      "Robert Sanchez has never convinced as Chelsea goalkeeper, who made an attempt to sign Mike Maignan earlier this summer. The Blues have sold Djordje Petrovic to Bournemouth for £25m, sent Kepa Arrizabalaga to Arsenal for £5m and let Marcus Bettinelli go to City.",
      "They still have Filip Jorgensen and Mike Penders on their books, with the latter highly-rated and currently on loan at Strasbourg for the season. Chelsea are reportedly content with their options – and the move for Maignan was an opportunistic one, rather than a planned one.",
      "But the chance to sign Donnarumma, who would clearly be an upgrade on the error-prone Sanchez, might change their minds. Sanchez improved at the end of last season and fits Enzo Maresca’s ethos of playing out from the back, yet will always have a blunder in him.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Paris Saint-Germain goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma has confirmed he will leave the club this summer. However, potential suitors Manchester United are steering themselves away from the Italian, who was never overly keen on joining them anyway.",
      "Donnarumma started for PSG as they won last season's Champions League and reached the final of the Club World Cup. His PSG career is now over though, with Lucas Chevalier joining from Lille and Donnarumma announcing his departure on Tuesday night.",
      "PSG have named their squad for the Super Cup against Tottenham Hotspur, who beat United in the Europa League final in May and Donnarumma isn't in it. Chevalier has been joined by Matvey Safonov and Renato Marin, with last season's first choice keeper nowhere to be seen.",
      "His absence has prompted increased talk of a Premier League switch, with United, Manchester City and Chelsea strongly linked with him, with City said the be front-runners according to reports in France.",
      "United, meanwhile, are distancing themselves from reports of their interest. Ruben Amorim's side have shown ambition by spending £200m on a flurry of attacking talent, but aren't in Europe this season, something which is a key requirement of Donnarummma's.",
      "Chelsea had also been linked with Donnarumma, but the Blues are believed to be happy with current keepers Robert Sanchez and Filip Jorgensen. Belgian youngster Mike Penders is also highly regarded in West London, and is spending the current season on loan at Strasbourg.",
      "According to reports in Italy, Galatasaray and Bayern Munich are among the other clubs able to match the Italian's wage demands. Both clubs are involved in the Champions League, with Gala already flexing their muscles with big contracts for Victor Osimhen and Leroy Sane.",
      "If United did move for Donnarumma, it would likely mean an exit for one of Andre Onana or Altay Bayindir. Turkish keeper Bayindir has played regularly in pre-season as Onana works his way back to full fitness, but the Cameroon international may be ready to return against Arsenal on Sunday.",
      "\"For us, it doesn't matter which team we will play,\" Bayindir told club media after helping United beat Fiorentina on penalties on Saturday. \"Every game is important in the Premier League. This week, we will work for Arsenal, and then from the Arsenal game, step by step for the next game, we will prepare ourselves.\"",
      "United's opponents have added a new keeper themselves this summer, though he is unlikely to start on Sunday. Spanish international Kepa Arrizabalaga joined in a cut-price move from Chelsea, but remains second choice behind David Raya.",
      "The Sunday clash will also allow Viktor Gyokeres to face off against his former manager Ruben Amorim. A reunion for the ex-Sporting pair had looked possible early in the window, but Gyokeres instead moved to North London in a £64m deal.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Ruben Amorin’s side finished 15th last season after scoring only 44 goals in Premier League games. But the £73.7m signing of Slovene Benjamin Seska has taken their summer spending on strikers to over £200m following the arrival of Bryan Mbeumbo and Matheus Cunha.",
      "And former Reds defender Neville believes there will have to be an improvement on the last torrid campaign. “I think they'll be looking at Champions League, I think that'll be the ambition,” he said. “I think we've gone past the point now where we say Manchester United have to win the league, I think that's unrealistic.",
      "“I think top six would be healthy, I think that my feeling is probably between seventh, eighth is where I'm looking at it now, but I think they could, without Europe, they could get into the top six if they have a good run, and those players settling up front, which I'm actually quite happy about the players they've signed up front.",
      "“I didn't think they had the £200 million to spend. If you said to me after that Tottenham game in the Europa League that Manchester United would have a forward line of those three that they've signed, I'd have snapped your hand off. I like the profile of those players, whether they settle in now is obviously the big question.",
      "\"Two of them are proven Premier League players, obviously they've got to step up a level, Sesko's young, he's got potential. He's young, can he get off to a good start? That's important for him.",

If they can get 40 goals, United's goals last season was terrible, they've got a good chance of getting into that top six, but they've got to settle those three players, and we can't take that for granted anymore at United. If they get a goalkeeper, I think that they could get into the top six, but a lot of things have to go on.”",
      "Manchester United conceded 54 Premier League goals to finish the season with a goal difference of -10. Paris-Saint Germain goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma is available for £30m - and big wages - as an upgrade from Andre Onana.",
      "Amorin will also have more time to work with his players without European football. Antonio Conte took Chelsea from 10th to champions in his first season in 2016-17.",
      "“I think it'll help, it has to help, because there's basically more training time, less pressure on the players, less injuries, it means that the best players can play more often in the league, and not have those demands of a Thursday night game,” Neville said. “But I think we've got to start the season well, there were some tough fixtures early on.”",
      "“It's a big game, we're out for Arsenal,” he said. “I think there's going to be that much pressure on Arsenal, just because we're in year five now, I think it's year six, and it just feels like right from the start everyone's eyes are on them. so I don't think it's a great game actually for Arsenal, to kick off the season as well, because of the situation that they're in, where it just feels like all eyes are on them from the very start.",
      "“I'm not saying it's Premier League or bust, that type of thing, because I actually think Mikel Artel has done a brilliant job, and to be second, year after year, people sort of sneer at him, Arsenal finish second again, but there's a lot of good clubs in this, so to second every year is not a mean feat.",
      "“I think it would be good for them to get some sort of trophy. I think they had a good result in their last pre-season match but I think the one before that, they lost at home, and there was a few murmurs in the crowd. It's not just people outside, people in the stadium are worried. It's like: ‘This has to happen now’.”",

      "Jadon Sancho has been bombarded by messages from Besiktas fans on social media after the Turkish side emerged as an escape route for the Manchester United reject.",
      "Sancho has been exiled at United, where Ruben Amorim has placed him and other unwanted players in a so-called ‘bomb squad’. He, Alejandro Garnacho, Antony and Tyrell Malacia have been told to follow in the footsteps of Marcus Rashford by finding a new club.",
      "The 25-year-old winger has been linked with moves to Juventus, Fenerbahce and Borussia Dortmund, but a move is yet to materialise. His £300,000-a-week wages at United, where he is under contract until June 2026, have proven problematic in the market.",
      "However, speculation has ramped up once more with the news that both Roma and Besiktas are actively pursuing a deal for Sancho. New Roma boss Gian Piero Gasperini is keen on signing him, while former United manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer wants a reunion with him in Istanbul.",
      "Besiktas has something that Roma doesn’t: an army of online supporters out to persuade Sancho to move to Turkey. His latest Instagram post, which shows photos of him relaxing on holiday has racked up over 5million comments, the vast majority of which simply read: “Come to Besiktas”.",
      "And the club’s president Serdal Adali is willing to follow through with the fans’ wishes. “Just as much as the community wants him, I want him too,” he told Turkiye Today. “What matters is not only our desire, but also if the player wants to come to Turkey. We have a budget, and we will do our best to bring him here.",
      "“Players like Jadon Sancho usually prefer clubs playing in the Champions League. Whether it happens today or not, it is hard to say. If it is possible, we will get him. Besiktas fans can rest assured.”",
      "Sancho spent last season on loan with Chelsea, but the club turned down the opportunity to sign him permanently, deciding they would rather stump up a £5million fee than pay £25m for his services. He then agreed personal terms with Fenerbahce and Juventus, only for those deals to collapse and former United striker Teddy Sheringham is worried his career is on the downslide.",
      "“Jadon Sancho will definitely not play for a big club ever again. He will probably tell you that he can and he will but not for me,” Sheringham told Snabbare. “I see that he's burned his bridges with the manager. He’s not even got a place in the changing room.",
      "“Maybe if he’d be given another chance he could work for what Amorim wants but I know from experience once you've gone down that path of being unhappy and wanting out that it's very hard to turn it around with the manager, with the supporters, with the other players.",

      "Alejandro Garnacho has been spotted appearing to hold a vape while in the middle of getting a tattoo. While it hasn't been confirmed what specific product it is, the Manchester United winger has previously been spotted with an e-cigarette by his side.",
      "In 2023, the 21-year-old posted a photo of himself watching a United game at home when fans spotted a green vape pen on the table in front of him. Garnacho swiftly deleted the Instagram story before posting it again without the appearance of the vape pen, which was claimed to belong to someone else.",
      "The Argentina international has now been snapped with what appears to be a vape in his left hand while getting a tattoo. The image was plastered across social media, prompting plenty of comments from fans online.",
      "One X user wrote: \"There's your star boy.\" While another commented: \"Don’t let Chelsea see this seriously.\"",
      "The winger - who has agreed personal terms on a move to Chelsea - was told that his United career was over in May after Ruben Amorim informed him that he must find a new club at the end of the season.",
      "Arriving at Old Trafford in 2020, it was in 2022 that he made his first team debut under Erik ten Hag. He has since gone on to make 144 appearances for the club, racking up 26 goals and 22 assists in that time.",
      "While he's reportedly been valued at £70million by United, Chelsea are said to be looking to a deal in the £50million range, despite Garnacho having three years left on his current United contract.",
      "While the youngster's talent is evident, Amorim hinted at the reasons he thinks the forward is open to a move away from Manchester. Speaking earlier this summer, the Portuguese boss said: \"I think with Garnacho, you can understand and you can see that he's talented, he's a really talented boy. But sometimes things don't work out and you cannot explain specifically what it is.",
      "\"But I have the feeling – and I think it's clear - that Garnacho wants a different thing with a different leadership and I can understand that. So I don't think it's a problem. Sometimes you adapt to one guy and you have the connection.",
      "\"Other times you want a new challenge. So we try to make everything OK for all parties. To the club, to the coach and to the player. It's a natural thing in football.\"",
      "Amid Marcus Rashford's exit and the likely departures of Garnacho, Antony and Jadon Sancho, Amorim has reconstructed his attacking force with the signings of Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko.",

      "A number of Manchester United's players have been in contact with Brighton's Carlos Baleba about the prospect of him moving to Old Trafford in the final weeks of the transfer window.",
      "Last week the Red Devils expressed an interest in the player, who has seen his stock rise with the Seagulls. He is the latest player to move to the Amex as a relatively unknown quantity before becoming a huge hit and those in Manchester are now circling.",
      "The Cameroon midfielder will have played with Andre Onana at international level and was previously team-mates with Leny Yoro at Lille. Several of the United squad have been in contact to explain the current landscape and ambitions, reports the Athletic.",
      "Baleba played in both of Brighton's wins over the Manchester outfit last season and was one of the most impressive players in his position across the Premier League. United though accept that any deal may be hard to strike given the numbers involved.",
      "Having already spent more than £200million on new signings there is not huge amounts of budget left. The club are not expected to submit a bid for Baleba unless they believe there is a chance of success as they continue with indirect conversations.",
      "Brighton have already sold Joao Pedro to Chelsea for £60m, lessening their need to sell. The Seagulls also want to retain their top talent and the price they slap on Baleba may curtail United's hopes of getting a deal over the line. The last time the south coast side sold a player of Baleba's profile it was Moises Caicedo - who left for more than £100m.",
      "The Cameroonian himself has shown no great desire to leave the Amex and Brighton. Their chief executive Paul Barber recently played down speculation about Baleba making the move to Manchester.",
      "He said: \"We will always try to make sure we sell our best players at the right time, not just for the player but for us. If we end up doing that with any player, it's with the view to leave Fabian with a competitive squad, whatever happens. We don't want to sell our best players.",
      "\"Carlos is a fantastic talent who has a lot of years ahead of him. We hope he will be here for many years to come. But it's something that, as always, is subjective to the dynamics of the football world which isn't always predictable.\"",

      "Carlos Baleba is top of Ruben Amorim's transfer wishlist, but Manchester United could have saved themselves a fortune if they'd signed the now £104million-rated midfielder in 2023.",
      "The Brighton star has been attracting interest throughout the summer window, and Amorim's team is currently assessing Baleba's willingness to join United and the salary price point required to tempt him into a switch. The Seagulls, though, have no current plans to sell the 21-year-old.",
      "A number of current United stars have contacted Baleba about a move to Old Trafford as part of a charm offensive to convince him to head to the north west. It comes as United learn they could have snapped up the young midfielder for a staggering £81m less than they'll have to pay now if they'd landed him two years ago.",
      "At the time of Baleba's transfer to Brighton in 2023, the then-19-year-old was starring for Lille and shining as a defensive midfielder against the likes of Lyon and Paris Saint-Germain. Many clubs had been linked to the young Cameroonian, but the Seagulls came out on top, snapping him up for £23m and tying him down to a five-year deal.",
      "This contract, which lasts until 2028 with the option of a further year, is the leverage that the Seagulls will use to ensure they get the best deal for Baleba should he push for a move to Old Trafford.",

      "Amorim has already splashed the cash this summer, securing the signatures of Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko for a combined total of over £200m. And it would take a huge bid of £104m to unstick Brighton from their stance on Baleba.",
      "Speaking on United's transfer business in July, Amorim said: \"Cunha and Bryan, they had different solutions [offers]. They had Champions League offers. And they wanted to come here. People that say that they come here because of the money… that is a lie. That I know for sure. So, I’m really happy with that.",

      "\"And then one really important thing is that they want to come here. That is the key point. If during the market we can find someone that can help the team and have all that boxes with them, we are going to do it. If not, we cannot do it because it's an important time in our club.\"",

The La Liga side want to see the former Ajax ace return to the club but want to hang on until the final moments of the transfer window to close a deal with United for a loan with option or obligation to buy.",

      "Manchester United have already received a ringing endorsement of new striker Benjamin Sesko from Slovenia manager Matjaz Kek. The Red Devils signed the RB Leipzig forward in a deal worth up to £74million, with Sesko penning a five-year contract at Old Trafford.",
      "United boss Ruben Amorim is hoping Sesko can lead his new-look attack alongside Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo. The 22-year-old is considered one of Europe's most exciting centre-forwards and joins United after netting 21 goals for Leipzig across all competitions last season.",
      "The striker was on Arsenal's radar earlier this summer and ultimately opted to sign for the Red Devils over a move to Newcastle United. Slovenia boss Kek has witnessed Sesko's development over the last four years and knows exactly what the striker will offer United.",
      "\"From time to time, I have to stop him a bit and calm him down: it's just the amazing energy [that he has],\" Kek told Italian reporters ahead of Euro 2024. \"He is like a magnet, and such a positive one.",
      "\"It is clear that his likeability and splendid public appearances are making it known to little boys and girls that there is a lot of work, training, and sacrifices behind this [success].\"",
      "It appears Sesko's impressive attitude will slot seamlessly into the atmosphere Amorim is building at United. On the field, despite regularly playing alongside the physical Aleksandar Mitrovic for his country, Kek highlighted Sesko's commanding presence up front - a quality that will only have developed further over the past year.",
      "\"We're talking about a physically strong centre-forward who has made great progress, also technically, month after month. He came to [the national team] when he was just a lad: a 17-year-old boy, and since then I have been watching him grow into a man. He has become a very important part of the team.",
      "\"Despite his youthfulness, he carries a sort of energy - the character of a diligent boy who would train day and night to achieve his goal.\"",
      "Kek gave Sesko his Slovenia debut the day after his 18th birthday, with the forward netting 16 times in 41 appearances for his country. Sesko's new boss Amorim agreed with Kek's verdict before seeing the striker in action for United.",
      "\"He has the characteristics that we needed,\" Amorim told MUTV. \"Ben is a player that, with all the information that we have, we need to stop the guy from working - it is not the opposite! That is also important.",
      "\"He is really young, he is good in the air, he is good running the channels, and he is good on the ball, so I think he has great potential. I think he can improve a lot. For sure, he is going to feel at home in our club. He is the right character in this group, so we are really, really happy to have him.\"",
      "\"The history of Manchester United is obviously very special, but what really excites me is the future,\" Sesko said after joining the club. \"When we discussed the project, it was clear that everything is in place for this team to continue to grow and compete for the biggest trophies again soon.",
      "\"From the moment that I arrived, I could feel the positive energy and family environment that the club has created. It is clearly the perfect place to reach my maximum level and fulfil all of my ambitions. I cannot wait to start learning from Ruben and connecting with my teammates to achieve the success that we all know we are capable of together.\"",

      "In an effort to determine how to deal with a dilemma like Alexander Isak, Eddie Howe could do worse than mimic the example set by Sir Alex Ferguson. Newcastle find themselves with a wantaway superstar desperate to leave the club for pastures new, as Manchester United did when Cristiano Ronaldo showed a liking towards Real Madrid in 2008.",
      "Isak, 25, has made no secret of his desire to leave St. James' Park, which has led to him being frozen out of the squad on the eve of the new Premier League campaign. The Athletic reported Isak, who was already the subject of a rejected £120million bid from Liverpool, is \"adamant\" he'll never play in black and white again, having grown despondent after learning he won't yet be offered a new contract.",
      "The details are different, but certain aspects of the stand-off closely resemble United's predicament with Ronaldo 17 years ago. The Portugal talisman had just led the Red Devils to Champions League glory, prompting then-Real president Ramon Calderon to publicly proclaim his intention to make the world-beater one of his own.",
      "Ferguson, 83, didn't take kindly to the declaration and informed his player as such, though there was a caveat to his defiance. Writing in his 2013 memoir, 'My Autobiography', the Scot struck a secret agreement with the five-time Ballon d'Or-winner that he would remain for one more year before being allowed to leave on United's terms.",
      "A passage from the book read: \"I found the boy expressing an urge to go to Real Madrid, and told him, 'You can’t go this year, not after the way Calderon has approached the issue.'",
      "\"I said, ‘I know you want to go to Real Madrid, but I’d rather shoot you than sell you to that guy now. If you perform, don’t mess us about, and someone comes and offers us a world-record fee, then we will let you go.' I had already conveyed that message to his agent, Jorge Mendes.",
      "\"I did well to calm him down. I told him the reason I was refusing to sell him that year was because of Calderon. I said, 'If I do that, all my honour's gone, everything's gone for me, and I don't care if you have to sit in the stands. I know it won't come to that, but I just have to tell you I will not let you leave this year.'\"",
      "The rest is history. Ronaldo saw out one more season at Old Trafford before joining Real for a then-world-record fee of £80m after Florentino Perez took over as Calderon's presidential successor in Madrid.",
      "It ended up being money very well spent on their part, and Ferguson got to keep his honour intact. The same perhaps can't be said for Isak at this rate after reportedly stating his intent to sit in the stands rather than play for Newcastle again.",
      "And if Howe were to replicate Ferguson's line of logic, he may have to make peace with the possibility of Isak seeing out significant game time on the sidelines. It's all but impossible to envision in this day and age, but both Howe and his Saudi bosses have to consider that possibility, with no obvious suitors lining up to meet his supposed £150m price-tag at this stage of the transfer window.",
      "The Swede's alleged act of defiance has angered the talkSPORT duo of Gabby Agbonlahor and Ally McCoist, who criticised his actions on Tuesday. And the pair believe Isak's summer shenanigans, which include missing Newcastle's pre-season tour and training at former club Real Sociedad, have only harmed his appeal in the long run.",
      "Former Aston Villa striker Agbonlahor took aim at Isak after hearing the latest developments and asked: \"Who does he think he is? Disgusting, what that club has done for you.\"",
      "Scottish football icon McCoist hammered home the point by questioning whether Isak's behaviour was becoming of an elite transfer target: \"If you're Liverpool, is that the kind of person you want to be signing?\"",

LiveScore uncovered that just 21 per cent of Premier League fans agreed that it was easy to get tickets to watch the action live, with 81 per cent citing availability and pricing as the two biggest stumbling blocks.",

      "\"And I see, and when I travel a lot into Europe and spoke with the supporters, meeting fans, the demand is still massive. And it's going to be massive because football is the most popular sport in the world.",

      "Brighton boss Fabian Hurzeler does not fear losing his Seagulls stars, and is confident his side will continue to find solutions when their stars are sold. Carlos Baleba is the latest standout player to be linked with a move away from the Amex Stadium, with Manchester United the interested party.",
      "The Red Devils have a midfielder next on their agenda after completing a deal for Benjamin Sesko. The £74million transfer followed the additions of Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha to Ruben Amorim's squad.",
      "Brighton have already seen Joao Pedro depart this summer for a substantial sum and waved goodbye to the likes of Alexis Mac Allister and Moises Caicedo in recent seasons. And Hurzeler, 32, is not perturbed at the prospect of that being a pattern that continues heading into the new season.",
      "While the Seagulls head coach pointed to examples of Brighton not exclusively being a selling club, the German boss' stance may provide United with some heart. There was certainly no hands off warning as Hurzeler discussed his squad.",
      "\"We as a club always find solutions and I'm sure in the future we will find solutions,\" Hurzeler told the Monday Night Club. \"That's our model, we have to accept it.",
      "\"I think that as a club we have proved we are not only selling big players. We have had offers for other players - big offers for [Kaoru] Mitoma and other players. We proved that we are not selling every player.",
      "\"Of course there were some big players who left the club, but there are new players that are coming into the club. With the togetherness we have, with the team chemistry we have, we can compete with the big teams, and we can compete with teams who might be individually better than us.\"",
      "Hurzeler retains confidence in his side's ability to handle any setback. \"No chance. I don't feel fear,\" he said when asked if he worries about being required to sell key players.",
      "\"I'm not afraid of anything because the only thing we can do is be the best version we can be every day, like work as hard as we can. All the other things we can't influence, so we really have to focus on us.",
      "\"For sure, we can't spend the money like the big teams but one of our biggest values is togetherness. And if you stay together, if we try to push our limits and increase the boundaries, then I'm sure we can compete with the big teams.\"",

      "Benjamin Sesko is earning much less than fellow Premier League newcomer Viktor Gyokeres after rejecting a bigger salary elsewhere to join Manchester United.",
      "Newcastle were keen to sign the Slovenian international and even offered him a higher salary to agree terms, but Sesko opted instead to join Ruben Amorin's project at Old Trafford.",
      "Sesko joined United on a five-year deal paying RB Leipzig a potential £74m - £66.4million with £7.6m in add-ons - to finally land a new centre-forward. The 22-year-old will earn around £160,000 per week, just over £8.3m a year. It means Sesko is nowhere near the top earner at Old Trafford, with Casemiro topping the pile, taking home a whopping £350,000 each week and £18.2m annually.",
      "Indeed, Sesko actually left money on the table as he agreed to work under Amorim in Manchester rather than Eddie Howe in the north east, such was his desire to join the Red Devils.",
      "Gyokeres, meanwhile, joined Arsenal from Sporting Lisbon in July in a deal worth £64m. The Swedish striker, who formerly worked under Amorim in Portugal, had a wide range of European clubs monitoring his situation - although few took the plunge to actually negotiate a deal with Sporting - before inking a five-year deal in north London.",
      "The 27-year-old now rakes in a hefty £200,000 per week, or £10.4m a year, at Arsenal before bonuses. Only Declan Rice, Martin Odegaard, Gabriel Jesus and Kai Havertz earn more at the Emirates as things stand.",
      "Sesko is therefore earning £40,000 less than his fellow newcomer. However, if United make the Champions League qualifying spots this season, then the Slovenian's wages will increase to £200,000 per week, putting him on par with Gyokeres.",
      "Gyokeres is set to bring something that has been distinctly lacking at Arsenal in recent times - goals from a striker. While the Gunners were third in the top-scoring rankings last season, they still scored 22 fewer goals overall than they did in the 2023/24 campaign.",
      "The hope at the Emirates is that it will be the determining factor in winning a first title in over 20 years. Gyokeres could well be the man for the job, given that he scored a whopping 97 goals in 102 matches to help lead Sporting to two league titles during his time with the club.",
      "Discussing Gyokeres' signing and what he will bring, Arteta said: \"Viktor has so many qualities. He is a quick and powerful presence up front, with incredible goalscoring numbers at club and international levels.",
      "\"He brings a clinical edge with a high conversion rate of chances into goals, with his intelligent movement in the box making him a constant threat. We're excited about what Viktor brings to our squad and are looking forward to starting working with him.\"",
      "Meanwhile, Sesko is also promising to bring goals and assists to Man United this season. In the 2024/25 campaign, the Red Devils managed only 44 goals - a serious decline compared to their last second-placed finish in 2021/22, where they scored 73.",
      "With Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo already in the building at Old Trafford, Sesko joins a new-look front line that will be planning to turn United's fortunes around this season. During his short Leipzig career, the young forward scored 39 goals and assisted eight times in 87 games in all competitions.",
      "Discussing his new club, Sesko said: \"The history of Manchester United is obviously very special but what really excites me is the future. When we discussed the project, it was clear that everything is in place for this team to continue to grow and compete for the biggest trophies again soon.",
      "\"From the moment that I arrived, I could feel the positive energy and family environment that the club has created. It is clearly the perfect place to reach my maximum level and fulfil all of my ambitions. I cannot wait to start learning from Ruben and connecting with my team-mates to achieve the success that we all know we are capable of together.\"",

      "Robert Lewandowski has revealed that he \"said yes\" to the opportunity to move to Manchester United under Sir Alex Ferguson - only for the move to never materialise.",
      "The Barcelona star has been one of Europe's elite No 9s for well over a decade, setting numerous records, but a different path may have seen him play at Old Trafford under the Scot in his final year as a manager.",
      "It was in 2012 that he gave the green light to move to Manchester from Borussia Dortmund for what would've been the final spell of Ferguson's stint in Manchester. The interest came off the back of a season where Lewandowski claimed the Bundesliga title, scoring 30 times.",
      "Dortmund though simply were not willing to sell up and that put pay to any switch. The Polish star told the BBC: \"To Manchester United I decided and said yes. I wanted to join Manchester United, to see Alex Ferguson.\"",
      "It means that Lewandowski has been prolific in Germany and Spain, but never England. Whilst there is a part of him that would've loved to have tried himself in the Premier League, he insists a CV that boast Dortmund, Bayern Munich and Barcelona cannot be sniffed at.",
      "He admitted: \"Maybe it could be a regret [not to play in the Premier League]. But when I am looking back [having] played for Bayern Munich, Dortmund and now Barcelona I have to say I am very happy with my career.",
      "\"I don't have this kind of feeling that I missed something, because every move or decision... I made because I wanted it.\"",
      "It was another heavyweight managerial figure in Jurgen Klopp who aided Lewandowski's development at Dortmund. The German is regarded among the best managers the club has ever had and his personal touch proved crucial in the Pole's career trajectory.",
      "He moved to the club as a youngster, not long after he'd lost his father in his teenage years, and it was until his relationship with Klopp that he found someone to help fill that void with one interaction changing his life.",
      "\"When I moved to Dortmund I was a very young guy, I lost my father when I was 16,\" he said. \"I for sure was a boy who was more closed, I didn't want to speak about my emotion. However, after a few years I met someone who I don't want to say was like a father but similar.",
      "\"Maybe after so many years the kind of conversation that I missed with my father, I had with Jurgen. I remember the conversation until now because it changed my life, it changed my football life. I put my emotion out, I put out the words I had kept in for a few years and after this I felt freedom. Maybe because of this I started to play better and better.\"",

      "Free agent Dominic Calvert-Lewin would be a steal of a signing for Manchester United, if Frank Lampard's opinion is anything to go by. The Coventry City boss worked with the striker during his time in charge of Everton between 2022 and 2023.",
      "Despite the 28-year-old being blighted with injury for the majority of the season Lampard took tenure, he was left impressed with the star's capabilities. It comes as Calvert-Lewin's nine-year stint with Everton came to a close this summer, with the striker leaving the club as a free agent with 71 goals to his name from 273 appearances.",
      "But it may not take him long to find a new home. Manchester United are currently said to be showing an interest in Calvert-Lewin, as Ruben Amorim looks to further strengthen the side he inherited from Erik ten Hag in November. Calvert-Lewin is also said to be keen on the idea of signing for the club.",
      "And a transfer is good news for United fans if Lampard's gleaming opinion of the player is anything to go off. Speaking about Calvert-Lewin during his reign at Goodison Park, Lampard said: \"Dominic is a high level striker, an England striker, a Premier League regular goalscorer with all his natural attributes that we see in terms of the types of goals that he can score, his strengths, his speed, his aerial ability.",
      "\"You have to try and play to the best strengths of that without a doubt and I think also, Dominic is a forward that can connect the game and hold the ball and drop in between lines at times as well.\"",
      "He added: \"He has been great. When I say that, throughout the period of time I have been here, he has a real desire to be playing regularly and showing what he can do.",
      "\"He has done everything he can do, which can sometimes be frustrating, but has handled himself in the right way. When you take a few knocks like that, and I know it myself as a player at times, they can knock you back and you don't feel like you are contributing to the team.",
      "\"Those things are hard to handle for any player and, looking back on it, I actually think he has handled them very well to get to a place where he should enjoy his moment last week when he shows an individual performance like he did. It's now a maintenance issue of trying to keep him in that level.\"",
      "Lampard was also quick to praise Calvert-Lewin for his rise at Everton under Carlo Ancelotti between 2019 and 2021. As per the Standard, he said: \"Not everyone gets in their first team at 17 or 18, other than the Wayne Rooney and Michael Owen types of the world.",
      "\"Other players have to find different ways and now he has shown himself, last season and particularly this season, consistently he's an all-round striker. Every part of his game is a real threat.\"",
      "Amorim has already spent more than £200million this summer on Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko, but with Rasmus Hojlund's future at Old Trafford in question, he may still want to bring in a backup striker for the fresh season. talkSPORT claims United are one of three clubs in talks with Calvert-Lewin. Hojlund has failed to live up to his price tag since signing from Atalanta in a £72m deal back in 2022, as evidenced by the fact that he scored just four Premier League goals last term.",
      "Hojlund has been told that he is free to leave the Theatre of Dreams for £30m this summer, despite the 22-year-old insisting that he hopes to fight for his place under Amorim. However, it is now reported that Hojluind is open to a move to AC Milan, with Il Rossoneri looking to secure a season-long loan deal for the Dane.",
      "Should Hojlund depart, even just on a temporary basis, then the only backups to Sesko would be Joshua Zirkzee - who managed just three goals in the Premier League last season - and an inexperienced Chido Obi. While Calvert-Lewin may not be the highest name on United fans' list of hopeful signings, the striker would undoubtedly bring a wealth of Premier League experience to Old Trafford, and given he is a free agent, the risk relating to a transfer would be at a minimum outside of the star's wages.",
      "He is also keen on the idea of playing for Manchester United next season, parting ways with his agent with hopes of finding his own way to the club in the coming weeks.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Tom Heaton has revealed that he's already had to give a \"b********g\" to one of his Manchester United team-mates. Heaton, along with Bruno Fernandes and Harry Maguire, are the three players from the old United leadership group who have been included in a new one, set up by Ruben Amorim.",
      "The goalkeeper, who turns 40 next year, signed a one-year contract with United in June and continues to be a key voice in the dressing room. The latest additions to the group are Diogo Dalot, Lisandro Martinez and Noussair Mazraoui. The group is a diverse mix of three players in their thirties and three in their twenties, representing four countries across three continents.",
      "The average age of this group is about 30, and it has now been revealed that the veteran shotstopper has already criticised one of his Red Devils peers.",
      "\"They are responsible for the group,\" Amorim clarified when asked about his leadership selection. \"There are some things that in the last year I had to deal with. I said to them this year, you deal with that. Small issues are with you guys. You are responsible. All these small changes, I think it's helping the group.\"",
      "When asked if he'd had to tell any team-mates some hard truths, Heaton, a member of the old guard, chuckled: \"Yes, but only naturally. It's not just about delivering sort of b********gs. I think it's also about supporting people who need it, trying to make sure we're guiding it and channelling it in the right way.",
      "\"I think he (Amorim) feels quite strongly about having a group of players that have a strong influence on the dressing room. It provides a little bit of support to Bruno in that respect. That's how it came about and obviously honoured as ever to be part of that and try and have as much influence on it as I possibly can.\"",
      "New member Dalot is the second-longest-serving player in the United squad behind Luke Shaw, who is now in his 12th year at the club. Shaw featured in the original eight-man group established by Erik ten Hag but managed just four appearances last season, three of which came in May.",
      "During the 2024 season, Dalot followed Ronaldo's footsteps by claiming the Players' Player of the Year award. A veteran presence in the squad, multilingual, seldom sidelined through injury and personable, it was clear why he secured the majority of his team-mates' backing.",
      "\"It obviously brings you even more responsibility,\" Dalot acknowledged. \"But I think one of the reasons why that happened is because of the way I am.",
      "\"So I try to be the same person, but obviously it brings you even more responsibility because we're talking about a very good group of players with different personalities that I think we can try to create a culture where we demand the maximum from our teammates, from ourselves as well.",
      "\"But we have to be the first ones to give the example. I think that's the best way that I like to lead also. We have to be the first ones to show to everyone where we want to put the club back on top and then try to put everyone in the same. Like we say in Portugal, everyone is in the same boat.",
      "\"I think the decision was clear because obviously we're talking about six players with different personalities, but at the same time we need to start demanding more from each other, create this culture where when things are not going in the right direction, we have to be assertive and put it right.\"",
      "Dalot's conditioning is so legendary that he's been absent for just 13 club matches since returning to United from a season-long stint at AC Milan in 2021. An insider revealed that Dalot \"took every good trait when playing with Cristiano and only further enhanced his dedication.\"",
      "Sources have highlighted the noticeable transformation in Dalot's physique compared to his unveiling snaps in June 2018. Back then, a 19-year-old Dalot was recuperating from a meniscus injury that had him out of action for three months. Now, he employs a personal chef to whip up his meals at home.",
      "Likewise, Fernandes, who has long been part of United's leadership set-up, has been absent from just two matches due to injury in over five years, and his influence continues to be significant. In the 1-1 stalemate with Fiorentina on Saturday, for example, Fernandes encouraged Patrick Dorgu to ramp up his intensity in the 78th minute. A minute later, Dorgu was dashing into the penalty area.",

      "With Benjamin Sesko signed, Manchester United can finally switch their focus to other areas of the squad in need of investment.",
      "The Slovenia international finalised his £66.4million move to Old Trafford from RB Leipzig on Saturday, becoming United's fourth signing of the summer and their third in the attacking department.",
      "Despite signing Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo earlier this summer, the addition of an out-and-out centre-forward remained United's leading priority ahead of the September 1 transfer deadline.",
      "United have finished each of the last two Premier League campaigns with a negative goal difference, meaning they were left with no choice but to prioritise attacking signings this summer. Between them, Mbeumo, Cunha and Sesko scored 58 goals for their former clubs last season.",
      "In Cunha and Mbeumo, United have sourced two players with impressive Premier League records. They have scored 71 career goals in the division between them, plundering 35 of them last season.",
      "Sesko, of course, has arrived from overseas, meaning there is more of a risk attached, but he should benefit from operating alongside two players with Premier League pedigree.",
      "United have often turned to the overseas market for new additions in recent years, regularly taking one too many gambles. The additions of Rasmus Hojlund and Antony, for example, rank as two of the worst signings in United's history when you consider their price tags.",
      "No transfer is guaranteed to be a success at any level of the game, but there is a lot less risk attached when recruiting a player that knows the league.",
      "Having not seen the best version of Manuel Ugarte all that often in the last 12 months, United are hoping to add a midfielder to their ranks before the window closes. Brighton ace Carlos Baleba has emerged as a target and he would be a terrific signing for Ruben Amorim.",
      "Despite only being 21, the Cameroonian, who joined Brighton from Lille two years ago, has become one of the Premier League's most highly-rated midfielders. The latest hidden talent to be discovered by the Seagulls, Baleba is capable of doing a little bit of everything in midfield.",
      "Renowned for his energy, his ball-carrying expertise, his passing range and his hunger to win the ball back, he ticks a lot of boxes for United. The Reds currently lack a midfielder that can do a little bit of everything in the engine room.",
      "Ugarte was drafted in last summer to provide some defensive nous and bite, but it has become clear he is limited when in possession. He struggles to progress the ball in the way United need him to.",
      "Kobbie Mainoo is an excellent operator with enormous amounts of potential, but his long-term position under Amorim is yet to be nailed down. Furthermore, he is a forward-thinking player and lacks the defensive ability to play next to Bruno Fernandes in a midfield duo.",
      "Casemiro is past his best and struggled last season to keep up with the pace of the play in the Premier League, reserving his best performances for the Europa League. He also has less than a year remaining on his contract and should be sold if a new midfielder arrives.",
      "Baleba, on the other hand, is up and coming. He has demonstrated he has what it takes to consistently make his mark in the Premier League and United do lack a midfielder of his profile.",
      "Of course, it has been well-documented Baleba will not come cheap, but United are well aware of that. Brighton will dig their heels in to try and secure as high a fee as possible.",
      "Despite only being 21, Baleba has only played 21 Premier League games fewer than Cunha, racking up 61 top flight appearances in England over the last two seasons.",
      "United often turned to the Premier League's best talent during Sir Alex Ferguson's heyday. After signing Cunha and Mbeumo from domestic rivals already this summer, United would be wise to do the same again to solve their next transfer objective.",
      "Manchester United have unveiled their new third kit for the 2025/26 season.",

      "\"They are responsible for the group,\" Amorim explained. \"There are some things that in the last year I had to deal with. I said to them this year, you deal with that. Small issues are with you guys. You are responsible. All these small changes, I think it's helping the group.\"",
      "Heaton has a 14-year association with United through two separate stints and rejoined his boyhood club in 2021. \"I think he (Amorim) feels quite strongly about having a group of players that have a strong influence on the dressing room,\" Heaton explained, \"it provides a little bit of support to Bruno in that respect. That's how it came about and obviously honoured as ever to be part of that and try and have as much influence on it as I possibly can.\"",
      "Dalot is the second-longest serving member of the United squad after Luke Shaw, into his 12th year at the club. Shaw was a member of the octet established by Erik ten Hag but started four games last season, three of them in May.",
      "The MEN revealed last season Amorim gravitated towards Dalot and Fernandes. A natural development, given their shared nationality. Dalot is also fluent in four languages, which makes him one of the most approachable members of the squad.",
      "Cristiano Ronaldo mentioned Dalot and Martinez among three teammates he admired at United in 2022. Casemiro, the third, was also added to the original leadership group by Ten Hag.",
      "In 2024, Dalot emulated Ronaldo by becoming the United players' player of the year. A senior statesman of the squad, a polyglot, rarely injured and affable, it was easy to see why he got most teammates' vote.",
      "Dalot had his squad number upgraded to '2' by Amorim in the summer and he captained United in the second half of their goalless draw with Leeds United in Stockholm last month. The irony is he is no longer a certain starter, with Amad the favoured option on the right wing to collaborate with Bryan Mbeumo.",
      "Only one of the leadership group could feasibly start against Arsenal on Sunday - Fernandes. It is unlikely to cow the others in the dressing room.",
      "\"It obviously brings you even more responsibility,\" Dalot accepts, \"but I think one of the reasons why that happened is because of the way I am.",
      "\"So I try to be the same person, but obviously it brings you even more responsibility because we're talking about a very good group of players with different personalities that I think we can try to create a culture where we demand the maximum from our teammates, from ourselves as well.",
      "\"But we have to be the first ones to give the example. I think that's the best way that I like to lead also. We have to be the first ones to show to everyone where we want to put the club back on top and then try to put everyone in the same. Like we say in Portugal, everyone is in the same boat.\"",
      "Dalot is close to Ronaldo and had Raphael Varane and Casemiro within earshot during United's successful 2022-23 season, three serial winners to look up to. His fitness is so renowned he has missed only 13 club games since he returned to United from a season-long loan at AC Milan in 2021.",
      "A source said Dalot \"took every good trait when playing with Cristiano and only further enhanced his dedication\". Dalot wears leg compressors on long-haul flights to reduce any muscle soreness and maximise circulation.",
      "Sources have pointed out how much leaner and chiselled Dalot now looks in contrast to his unveiling pictures in June 2018. Dalot, 19 at the time, was recovering from a meniscus injury that kept him sidelined for three months but he had a cherub face. Now he employs a private chef to prepare his meals at home.",
      "Fernandes has only ever missed two United games through injury in five-and-a-half years. \"He has the highest pain threshold I have ever encountered,\" a Carrington source said.",
      "His influence remains profound. As recently as the 1-1 draw with Fiorentina on Saturday, Fernandes urged Patrick Dorgu to show more intensity in the 78th minute. A minute later, Dorgu was sprinting into the penalty area.",
      "Amorim included Mazraoui - signed by Ten Hag - as \"he's a character that I like\". Mazraoui played in seven different positions last season and was rested for only two games.",
      "Joshua Zirkzee enthused about how motivational a presence Martinez, sidelined since February 2 with a knee injury, has been in the treatment room. Martinez captained United in the 1-1 Europa League draw with Fenerbahce last year.",
      "Maguire, stripped of the captaincy by Ten Hag in July 2023, pulled the armband back on for the first time under Amorim during the 4-0 thrashing of Everton on December 1. Maguire's form over the past two seasons, having seen a £30million transfer to West Ham United collapse, is testament to his resolve. He is now one of a handful of respectable signings in the post-Ferguson era.",
      "United opened the doors to their renovated Carrington hub on Friday. Heaton, a veteran of training days at Lyttleton Road and The Cliff as a schoolboy, described the launch as \"a moment in the club. Especially for us as players, we're in it all the time. So I think we can use that to go again and build and move it forward and making sure that all the lads are aligned with that.\"",
      "Dalot is not as demonstrative as his compatriot Fernandes but is emboldened to pull players in line. \"Of course, otherwise we couldn't be in that group,\" he said. \"I think the decision was clear because obviously we're talking about six players with different personalities, but at the same time we need to start demanding more from each other, create this culture where when things are not going in the right direction, we have to be assertive and put it right.",
      "\"I think that's the only way to go to where we want to go.\"",
      "Expect a few more b********gs.",

      "If Ruben Amorim's starting XI against Fiorentina on Saturday confirmed anything, it was that Rasmus Hojlund will not be starting Sunday's Premier League opener against Arsenal at Old Trafford.",
      "The Dane was left out of the starting line-up for the second game running, with Amorim choosing to deploy Mason Mount up front instead.",
      "Whether Hojlund departs or not, Sesko is expected to be thrown straight into the starting XI this weekend and lead United's attack. He should be supported by fellow new recruits Bryan Mbeumo and Cunha, who occupied the two playmaker roles at the weekend.",
      "Following the penalty shootout triumph over Fiorentina, Amorim admitted he has an \"idea\" of what his starting XI will look like for the Premier League curtain-raiser against the Gunners. However, he did concede that his players could still alter his plans.",
      "When asked about having a selection headache, Amorim told MUTV: \"That is a good thing, it's supposed to be like that, not like last season when we had to struggle to put 11 players on the pitch.",
      "\"This is a normal thing, so I have to think and they need to fight during the week so they can change my mind. I have one idea, but they can change my mind during the week.\"",
      "With five days to go until the clash with Arsenal, United fans are beginning to share predictions and their opinions on what the starting XI should look like. Many of their predicted XIs have similar looks and it is unlikely their submissions will be far from the XI that is revealed at 3.15pm on Sunday afternoon.",
      "Factoring in how pre-season unfolded and how the landscape of the squad currently looks, it can be argued that eight starters are guaranteed: Andre Onana (expected to be back fit), Leny Yoro, Amad, Bruno Fernandes, Patrick Dorgu, Mbeumo, Cunha and Sesko.",
      "However, there is a debate to be had about who will start in the centre and on the left of the defence and alongside Fernandes in midfield.",
      "Harry Maguire and Ayden Heaven started against Fiorentina and Casemiro got the nod in the engine room next to Fernandes. The latter's performance reminded United of why they are still in need of a midfielder.",
      "Yoro is the only centre-back guaranteed to start against the Gunners after making four starts in a row in pre-season and producing some really promising performances, particularly in the United States. De Ligt bagged three starts, likewise Luke Shaw, but Maguire and Heaven only started twice.",
      "Maguire and De Ligt are competing to start in the middle of the defence and that battle was always likely to be decided by pre-season performances. Heaven has made rapid progress since joining United and is an exciting option for the left-sided centre-back role, but Shaw is also in the conversation to start.",
      "The other selection dilemma facing Amorim is who should start in midfield next to Fernandes. Kobbie Mainoo, Manuel Ugarte and Casemiro are competing for that spot and the latter earned three starts in pre-season.",
      "However, he showed last season he struggles to keep up with the pace of the play in the Premier League. Ugarte is a solid midfield destroyer, capable of winning the ball back, but he is limited in possession.",
      "Mainoo has talent Amorim needs to tap into, but the prospect of him and Fernandes starting next to each other in midfield risks leaving United exposed in the centre of the pitch.",
      "With eight starters looking nailed on, three places remain up for grabs.",
      "Manchester United have unveiled their new third kit for the 2025/26 season.",

      "The shirt is predominantly black with a yellow and blue trim. The trim features around the collar, on the shoulders and on the sleeve cuffs.",
      "It is inspired by the famous away kit worn by United between 1993 and 1995, including when the club won the Double for the first time in 1993/94.",
      "The Snapdragon logo, just as it is on the home and away shirts that were revealed earlier this summer, is again front and centre on the shirt. Qualcomm Technologies has a £60million a season sponsorship deal with the club and had their brand Snapdragon on the front of shirts for the first time last term.",
      "The shirt also features adidas' iconic Trefoil logo in yellow and the United crest is positioned inside a shield.",
      "Reimagining one of the most storied kits in the club's history, the design focuses on the details, from the engineered devil-base fabric to the authentic three-stripe tape and flat-knit crew collar and cuffs.After last season's celebrated reintroduction of the adidas Trefoil logo on their third shirt, United have said 'its return honours the logo's historic legacy in the sport, as well as acknowledging the rising role of fashion in today's game'.",
      "United's players donned the new away kit in their opening two pre-season friendlies of the summer before wearing their new home strip for the win over Bournemouth and the draws against Everton and Fiorentina.",

      "Hello and welcome to your dedicated Manchester United transfers blog on Wednesday, August 13.",
      "Heading into the final few weeks of the summer transfer window, United remain active and open to pursuing new opportunities. One of the latest names linked is Carlos Baleba of Brighton & Hove Albion.",
      "The young midfielder is considered one of the most highly rated prospects in European football, with a sky-high ceiling. So far, the club have added Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo, Diego Leon and Benjamin Sesko to their ranks.",
      "Ruben Amorim’s side wrapped up their pre-season campaign over the weekend with a 1-1 draw against Fiorentina at Old Trafford, going on to win the match in a penalty shootout. Now, the focus shifts to the start of the Premier League season and Sunday afternoon's clash with Arsenal.",
      "However, despite the significant investment in three high-profile attacking signings, further business could still be on the cards - provided United are able to sanction one or two departures. As for potential outgoings, Tyrell Malacia, Antony, Jadon Sancho, and Alejandro Garnacho are all effectively available for transfer.",
      "Catch up with the latest news, views and Manchester United transfer rumours below.",
      "According to Fabrizio Romano, contact with Brighton for the midfielder has continued from Manchester United's side.",
      "Speaking on his YouTube channel last night, he said: \"Contacts continue for Carlos Baleba. Today, Man United spoke again to the agents of the player. They are prepared to try to understand how much Brighton want.",
      "\"So this week, I expect Manchester United to try to understand the situation directly with Brighton, and let’s see what’s going to happen there. But Baleba remains a topic at United. They are still not moving on another midfielder, and it means that United maintain the contacts active for Baleba and also try to understand if they can really make it happen or if it’s going to be impossible because Brighton still have no intention to reduce their price tag.\"",
      "Give Me Sport report that Man United are keeping an eye on England international, Kane.",
      "The 32-year-old, who joined Bayern Munich from Tottenham Hotspur in 2023, has a release clause in his contract which will come into play in January 2026 and could see him leave the Bundesliga champions for as little as £56million.",
      "Manchester City have reportedly agreed personal terms with Paris Saint-Germain goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma over a move to the Etihad.",
      "The 26-year-old Italy international has been linked with a move to the Premier League after he was deemed surplus to requirements at the Parc des Princes under Luis Enrique. United were one of the Premier League clubs most frequently linked with a move for Donnarumma, though it seems that bitter rivals City are now looking to strike a move for the shot-stopper.",
      "French publication L'Equipe claims that Donnarumma had been in talks with both United and City but it is the latter who have reached an agreement on personal terms with the former AC Milan prodigy.",
      "We'll be keeping you updated throughout the day with the latest United news, as there are now less than three weeks until the summer transfer window closes. The countdown is also on for the Reds' Premier League opener against Arsenal!",
      "So, grab yourself a brew - let's get started, shall we?",
      "Join us tomorrow for all the latest Manchester United transfer news and rumours.",
      "See you then!",
      "Paris Saint-Germain goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma, who has been linked with a move to Manchester United this summer, has issued a statement on his future after being left out of Luis Enrique’s squad for the UEFA Super Cup final against Tottenham on Wednesday.",
      "The Italy international has one year remaining on his contract at the Parc des Princes and has been tipped to leave the club this summer.",
      "Donnarumma’s future in the French capital appears untenable, and his recent statement reads like a farewell to the club and its supporters, strongly suggesting that the decision to leave may not have been his own.",
      "Read what he had to say here.",
      "Manchester United remain confident of selling Rasmus Hojlund before the summer transfer window closes, writes James Quinlan.",
      "A hint to what life could be like at Old Trafford for Hojlund following those three signings came last Saturday too, when he was an unused substitute in 1-1 friendly draw with Fiorentina.",
      "The club have already judged around £30m to be a fair market value for a striker who last season scored only four Premier League goals in 32 outings.",
      "However, the CIES Football Observatory has freshly updated its estimated transfer values and would suggest United are severely underestimating themselves and their Danish international.",
      "Read the story here.",
      "David de Gea had a heartwarming interaction with Bruno Fernandes' children after Manchester United's pre-season friendly against Fiorentina over the weekend, writes Keifer MacDonald.",
      "The Reds drew 1-1 with the Serie A outfit at Old Trafford on Saturday afternoon after Simon Sohm's eighth-minute opener was cancelled out by a Robin Gosens own-goal.",
      "For De Gea, it was his first return to Old Trafford since he left United at the end of his contract in May 2023. The Spaniard spent 12 seasons with the Red Devils, making 545 appearances.",
      "Read the story here.",
      "Manchester United are not actively pursuing Paris Saint-Germain outcast Gianluigi Donnarumma, according to reports.",
      "The goalkeeper has one year remaining on his deal at the Parc des Princes and could depart for a reduced fee this summer. He has not been included in Luis Enrique's squad for their UEFA Super Cup meeting with Tottenham on Wednesday night amid ongoing speculation over his future.",
      "The Italian has been linked with a switch to the Premier League, although the Daily Mail claim United have shut down any suggestions he is a target for Ruben Amorim's side.",
      "Donnarumma is not a target and goalkeeper is not a priority position for the club this summer.",
      "Manchester United midfielder Toby Collyer is in talks over a loan move to Championship side Hull City, according to the Daily Mail.",
      "The article claims initial talks have been held over a season-long loan for the 21-year-old, with the Tigers having a strong track record of devloping young talent.",
      "It has been suggested talks are at an early stage and there remains some competition from Sheffield Wednesday, but the midfielder is open to a loan switch ahead of the new campaign.",
      "Garnacho joining Chelsea on a permanent deal could help Man United fund a swoop for Baleba and, also, hand the midfielder a dream welcome gift.",
      "Baleba appears to be open to an Old Trafford switch, but it seems very likely available (or unavailable) finances will be what prevents a would-be deal. Elsewhere, United are said to want £50million to sell Garnacho, but Chelsea are not currently keen on hitting that figure.",
      "If a compromise is reached on a fee, it seems almost guaranteed that United will put those funds towards signing Baleba. If that scenario does play out, United's latest arrival could be left the perfect welcome gift by the departing Garnacho. That is because both players wore the No.17 shirt last season and Garnacho moving on would leave that free for Baleba to take.",
      "As potential alternatives, Baleba has also worn No.20 and No.35 but - after a few alterations - only the former is available at United. It certainly seems as though the No.17 would be his first-choice considering he changed to that squad number at the start of his second season at Brighton.",
      "Man United have made an unusual Rasmus Hojlund decision after launching their new third kit for the upcoming Premier League season.",
      "The smart design is likely to go down a treat with supporters as the predominantly black kit includes a yellow and blue trim. The Adidas strip was unveiled to the general public on Tuesday morning and while there was not anything overtly unusual about the launch, the Dane's involvement may raise eyebrows.",
      "MEN Sport reported this week that the striker was now open to the possibility of signing for AC Milan.",
      "Throughout the summer, Hojlund had insisted that he saw his future at Old Trafford and was not interested in looking at other challenges. However, following the arrival of Benjamin Sesko last week, that mindset has now changed.",
      "Exactly whether the deal will be permanent or on loan is unclear. If United were to allow Hojlund to leave permanently, they would be looking for a price tag in the region of £30m.",
      "Slovenia coach Matjaz Kek has closely followed Sesko’s progress over the past four years and knows exactly what the striker brings to Man United.",
      "\"From time to time, I have to stop him a bit and calm him down: it's just the amazing energy [that he has],\" Kek told Italian reporters ahead of Euro 2024.",
      "\"He is like a magnet, and such a positive one. It is clear that his likeability and splendid public appearances are making it known to little boys and girls that there is a lot of work, training, and sacrifices behind this [success]. He is the modern striker par excellence. I don't know where he will play next season, he will decide but, for now, I'll enjoy him this summer.",
      "\"We're talking about a physically strong centre-forward who has made great progress, also technically, month after month. He came to [the national team] when he was just a lad: a 17-year-old boy, and since then I have been watching him grow into a man. He has become a very important part of the team.",
      "\"Despite his youthfulness, he carries a sort of energy - the character of a diligent boy who would train day and night to achieve his goal.\"",
      "Manchester United were one of three clubs to make an approach for Fiorentina centre-back Comuzzo, according to Tutto Sport.",
      "The report claims that several sides have expressed interest in the young defender in recent weeks, with Bournemouth and Southampton also making moves.",
      "Fiorentina owner and president Rocco Benito Commisso is said to be a strong admirer of Comuzzo and has rejected all three approaches. The club remain firmly opposed to selling, with Commisso convinced the youngster has a very bright future.",
      "According to a report from La Gazzetta dello Sport, Inter Milan aim to capitalize on the ongoing fallout between Jadon Sancho and Manchester United in a bid to sign him this summer.",
      "Inter, having decided to sign a forward this month, have added Sancho, Chelsea’s Christopher Nkunku, and Ademola Lookman to their target list. However, with Lookman reportedly commanding a hefty price, ‘all eyes’ are now on Sancho this summer.",
      "Speaking to reports, Real Betis' sporting director Manu Fajardo has expressed his desire to sign Antony this summer.",
      "He explained:",
      "The desire on both sides, player and club, is to be together again. Every day that passes, the hope grows, but if Antony arrives, it's because he's doing so in the numbers that suit Betis.",
      "Antony requested to leave United at the start of the summer.",
      "Hurzeler maintains he has no 'fear' of losing key players, even with Baleba the latest high-profile name linked to a potential departure.",
      "\"No chance. I don’t feel fear,\" Hurzeler told the BBC. \"I’m not afraid of anything because the only thing we can do is be the best version we can be every day, work as hard as we can.",
      "\"All the other things we can’t influence, so we really have to focus on us. For sure, we can’t spend the money like the big teams, but one of our biggest values is togetherness. And if you stay together, if we try to push our limits and increase the boundaries, then I’m sure we can compete with the big teams.\"",
      "Hurzeler continued: \"It’s not easy, but we proved last season that we are a very competitive team. Without Joao Pedro, for sure, he was an unbelievable player. But we can’t replace him with one player, we can replace him as a team. And that’s our focus.\"",
      "Former Italy manager Arrigo Sacchi has questioned Hojlund's hesitation to leave Man United despite interest from AC Milan.",
      "\"We’re not talking about van Basten, nor are we talking about one of the strongest centre-forwards in Europe at the moment. He’s a decent player, nothing more,\" Sacchi told La Gazzetta dello Sport. \"I understand the desire of the Rossoneri directors given that there is a shortage of strikers.",
      "\"But it has to be one that wants to come to Italy, one that doesn’t throw a tantrum. I don’t understand his choice. If Milan calls you, you pack your bags and get on the first plane to Malpensa. Milan, in the world of football, is a mystical name. I, along with all the players who are brought in, would take a tour of the trophy room so that we understand where we have come.",
      "\"Of course, Manchester United is also a legendary team. But on the one hand, there is a club, Milan, which is offering you a permanent job, and on the other hand, there is a club that is doing everything to try and sell you. What would you choose?’",
      "According to The Athletic, United's squad are beginning to rally around to try and help the Reds sign Carlos Baleba this summer.",
      "It is claimed that unnamed players have contacted the midfielder to explain the set-up at United.",
      "Onana and Mbeumo both represent Cameroon with Baleba while the midfielder knows Leny Yoro from their time together at Lille.",
      "Despite Brighton's stance that Baleba is not for sale this summer, their manager Fabian Hurzeler has insisted that he is not fearful of losing their better players in the transfer window.",
      "Brighton have already lost the likes of Joao Pedro in this window.",
      "He told the Monday Night Club:",
      "We as a club always find solutions and I'm sure in the future we will find solutions. That's our model, we have to accept it. I think that as a club we have proved we are not only selling big players. We have had offers for other players - big offers for [Kaoru] Mitoma and other players. We proved that we are not selling every player. Of course there were some big players who left the club, but there are new players that are coming into the club. With the togetherness we have, with the team chemistry we have, we can compete with the big teams, and we can compete with teams who might be individually better than us.",
      "So much focus has been on attacking quarters this summer that very few names have done the rounds in other positions. Although the Bayern Munich man is a fine player in his own right, surely United are stocked-up at the back? One to keep an eye on, even if it seems fanciful at this stage;",
      "So there we have it. Benjamin Sesko is expected to wear No.30 for United this season. Diego Leon has seemingly shifted to No.35 - despite only just taking No.30 himself - in a late U-turn from the decision-makers. Perhaps it was part of a deal for Sesko? Here are the numbers still available for further signings before the September 1 cut-off;",
      "No.14 / No.20 / No.27 / No.28 / No.29",
      "Barcelona ace Robert Lewandowski has admitted that he previously gave the green light to United.",
      "This happened in 2012 while the striker was still at Borussia Dortmund.",
      "He would later sign for Bayern Munich in 2014.",
      "MORE HERE.",
      "According to Fabrizio Romano, Chelsea are not interested in signing Gianluigi Donnarumma this summer.",
      "It is believed, despite them being linked with the Italian, that Chelsea are happy with the current goalkeepers on their books.",
      "United have also been linked with a move for Donnarumma this summer and Chelsea's stance comes after PSG left the goalkeeper out of their squad for the Super Cup on Wednesday.",
      "Despite knowing that there is clear interest from United in Baleba, Brighton are reportedly relaxed about the situation.",
      "That is according to journalist Florian Plettenberg, with the Seagulls thought to be against the idea of selling the midfielder this summer.",
      "Plettenberg's report adds that United have continued talks with Baleba's agent over the costs involved in a deal.",
      "Hello and welcome back to the United transfer blog this morning.",
      "My name is Jack Flintham and I shall be taking you through until 2pm with all the latest United news, views and transfer rumours.",
      "We are going to start off by continuing with the situation surrounding this man...",
      "According to The Athletic, United are continuing to explore whether a move for Carlos Baleba can be agreed this summer. The report claims that talks, so far via intermediaries on the Reds' behalf, have held to assess the midfielder's willingness to join, the salary required and Brighton's valuation.",
      "It's said that the Seagulls do not intend to sell Baleba in this window; they want to keep him for at least another season, and have not indicated a price yet. The Athletic adds that Baleba is keen on a move to Old Trafford.",
      "Several United players have reportedly contacted the Cameroonian about a potential transfer, explaining the project and ambitions of the club.",
      "So United fans, what do you think of the new third kit?",
      "The Reds have released the shirt this morning ahead of the new Premier League season! Take a closer look at how you can purchase it below.",
      "According to The Athletic, Chelsea have stepped up talks to sign Alejandro Garnacho from United. The report claims that the Blues view the winger's situation as an opportunity, as they look to sign a right-footed left winger to compete with Jamie Gittens.",
      "It's said that Chelsea are not inclined to simply meet the Reds' valuation. Garnacho reportedly expects to join the west Londoners before the summer transfer window slams shut on September 1, and he's ruled out all options other than moving to Stamford Bridge or staying at Old Trafford.",
      "According to The Athletic, Gianluigi Donnarumma is willing to leave Paris Saint-Germain, but only for the right club and at the right moment. The report claims that those close to the goalkeeper expected him to leave the French capital.",
      "It's said that Donnarumma will not be forced out of the club or made to accept an offer that he does not want. The Italy international continues to be linked with a move to United as Ruben Amorim looks to bolster his options between the sticks."

      "The countdown to the start of the new Premier League season is almost over.",
      "Less than 48 hours after Liverpool and Bournemouth open the 2025/26 campaign at Anfield on Friday night, Manchester United and Arsenal will take centre stage at Old Trafford on Sunday afternoon.",
      "The visit of the Londoners will mark the beginning of Ruben Amorim's first full season as United head coach, and there is an upbeat mood surrounding the club heading into their season opener.",
      "A successful summer transfer window, which has seen four new arrivals, and a positive pre-season campaign means United supporters will be arriving at Old Trafford on confident last season's woes will be banished.",
      "But what could Amorim's matchday squad for the season opener look like?",
      "If Onana wins his fitness battle and gets the green light to start, it will be interesting to see the landscape of the back three he is tasked with marshalling. Leny Yoro is a guaranteed starter after starting four of United's five friendlies, but there is less certainty about who will join him in defence.",
      "Matthijs de Ligt and Harry Maguire are competing to start in the middle of the back three and Ayden Heaven is rivalling Luke Shaw to start as the left-sided centre-back.",
      "All four players will believe they are worthy of starting berths, leaving Amorim with a selection dilemma to solve. There is no obvious answer, but De Ligt and Shaw could get the nod after making three starts each during the summer.",
      "Amad and Patrick Dorgu are shoo-ins to occupy the two wing-back positions. The latter came on in leaps and bounds during pre-season, particularly during the tour of the United States, while Amad started all five warm up matches.",
      "Bruno Fernandes is set to occupy one of the two midfield positions. The United captain has regularly flexed his muscles in the engine room and is a guaranteed starter.",
      "However, there is an ongoing debate about who should partner the Portuguese international. Manuel Ugarte, Kobbie Mainoo and Casemiro are the contenders and they all got opportunities to prove their worth during pre-season.",
      "In an ideal world, United will bring in a new midfielder before the transfer window slams shut, but that mission is unlikely to be fulfilled ahead of Sunday's game. It means Ugarte, amid his defensive profile, is the most logical partner for Fernandes.",
      "Mainoo will believe he is worthy of a starting berth, but he is a forward-thinking player, meaning the prospect of him partnering Fernandes in the centre of midfield would risk leaving United vulnerable to opposition attacks.",
      "Cunha, who scored 17 goals for Wolves last season, should start as the left-sided No.10. Bryan Mbeumo is the obvious pick to fill the other No.10 spot.",
      "Despite only featuring twice in pre-season due to a lack of match sharpness, Mbeumo impressed against both Everton and Fiorentina. He linked up really well with Amad and should be awarded his competitive debut for United from the start.",
      "Supported by Cunha and Mbeumo, Benjamin Sesko should come straight into the team and lead the attack. He arrived from RB Leipzig last weekend to provide the final piece in the attacking jigsaw.",
      "As far as the bench is concerned, Amorim has a competitive squad at his disposal, meaning he will have options to turn to. Tom Heaton had a better pre-season than Altay Bayindir and should be promoted to second-choice in the pecking order.",
      "Defensive cover can come from Diogo Dalot, Maguire and Heaven. Mainoo and Casemiro can offer midfield cover and Mason Mount will be able to offer support to Cunha and Mbeumo in the No.10 position.",
      "Unless an exit materialises beforehand, Hojlund should make the bench. Chido Obi should also make the matchday squad against his former club.",
      "United starting XI: Onana; Yoro, De Ligt, Shaw; Amad, Ugarte, Fernandes, Dorgu; Mbeumo, Cunha; Sesko.",
      "United substitutes: Heaton, Dalot, Maguire, Heaven, Mainoo, Casemiro, Mount, Hojlund, Obi.",

      "With just under three weeks of the summer transfer window remaining Manchester United face a race against time to get their shopping done.",
      "United have drafted in four new faces so far this summer, bringing in Diego Leon, Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and most recently Benjamin Sesko.",
      "The additions of Cunha, Mbeumo and Sesko are statement signings that should transform United's attack. Suddenly, last season's biggest weakness looks like being this season's biggest strength.",
      "Although United found the signing of Cunha a simple deal to complete given the £62.5million release clause he had in his Wolves contract, the deals to bring Mbeumo and Sesko to Old Trafford were not quite as smooth.",
      "United spent several weeks locked in discussions with Brentford to sign Mbeumo and they faced stiff competition from Newcastle United for Sesko. However, both players shared the same ambition: they wanted to join United.",
      "Mbeumo, who was also linked with Newcastle, made it clear to Brentford's hierarchy long before United reached a breakthrough in negotiations that his preferred destination this summer was Old Trafford. Sesko, too, set his sights on a move to M16.",
      "Having failed to qualify for any form of European football this season, concerns were raised about whether United would find it difficult to attract players who would not look out of place in the Champions League. However, just as head coach Ruben Amorim stated back in April, United will always appeal to players.",
      "He said: \"It's Manchester United. What I feel is that there's a lot of players that want to play for our club.",
      "\"I know that if you look at our club at the moment it looks like sometimes with all the problems with the staff, people going, changing coach, the results, it looks like a little bit of a problem at the moment. But we have a clear idea.",
      "\"That is the easiest part to explain to a player. And then it's Manchester United. Everybody wants to play for Manchester United.\"",
      "In Cunha, Mbeumo and Sesko, United have recruited three players who scored 58 goals between them last season. They could have quite easily ended up at clubs who could have offered them Champions League football this term.",
      "Instead, they wanted to move to Old Trafford, attracted to the size and the scale of one of the world's biggest clubs. United will now be hoping Brighton & Hove Albion ace Carlos Baleba subscribes to the same thinking.",
      "United remain keen to strengthen their midfield options ahead of the window closing and Baleba is on their radar. He is one of European football's most highly-rated midfielders and his ceiling is sky-high.",
      "Like Cunha, Mbeumo and Sesko, he would not look out of place in a team playing Champions League football this season. He can do a little bit of everything in midfield and his skillset is very attractive.",
      "With United's midfield in desperate need of fresh blood, the club's hierarchy will be hoping Baleba is the latest player to prove Amorim right and be attracted to the prospect of representing the Reds.",
      "Manchester United have unveiled their new third kit for the 2025/26 season.",

      "So, United feel the time is right to try and cash in on a player who only two summers ago cost them £72m.",
      "The club have already judged around £30m to be a fair market value for a striker who last season scored only four Premier League goals in 32 outings.",
      "However, the CIES Football Observatory has freshly updated its estimated transfer values and would suggest United are severely underestimating themselves and their Danish international.",

      "And they reckon Hojlund is actually worth between £57.8m and £66.4m (€67m and €77m).",
      "What the CIES algorithm may not consider is the immediacy of the situation. United have less than three weeks to seal an exit for the 22-year-old and options will be limited.",

      "United are among several European clubs to have been linked with the 26-year-old, as doubts continue to grow over his future at PSG. However, a recent report from the Daily Mail suggests that a goalkeeper is not currently a priority for the Manchester club, and talk of interest in the PSG outcast has been played down.",
      "That said, Donnarumma’s future in the French capital appears untenable, and his recent statement reads like a farewell to the club and its supporters, strongly suggesting that the decision to leave may not have been his own. \"To the special Paris fans,\" he wrote.",

      "Antony has spent some time with fellow Brazilian Matheus Cunha privately as his future appears to lie away from Manchester United.",
      "Antony spent the second half of the season at Real Betis, where he enjoyed a career revival. He recorded as many assists for the Seville club (five) as he had in 70 more appearances for United, instantly endearing himself to the La Liga side's supporters.",
      "He also helped Real Betis to reach the Conference League final as he later returned to Manchester, informing the club of his decision. Unsurprisingly, his former loan club re-joined the race to sign him, though they are reportedly only prepared to take him back on loan.",
      "While training away from the main United squad, Antony spent time with Cunha, last weekend, after the latter's £62.5million move from Wolves earlier this summer.",
      "On Sunday, Brazil celebrated Father's Day, and Antony appears to have spent the occasion with his family as well as Cunha's.",
      "Taking to Instagram, the Brazilian winger wrote: \"Dinner was really good. Thanks for the laughs and the chats.",
      "\"Chef Mauro Johnson, dinner was excellent. Thanks for dinner my brother Matheus Cunha - love you.\"",
      "Antony's future remains undecided after spending last season on loan at Real Betis. He's been linked with Bayer Leverkusen - now managed by ex-United head coach Erik ten Hag - Juventus and a possible return to Real Betis.",

      "Manchester United know they're a midfielder away from having a hugely competitive starting XI after addressing some key flaws in their squad. The arrivals of Bryan Mbeumo, Matheus Cunha and Benjamin Sesko have given Ruben Amorim a completely new-look starting front three.",
      "They'll need time to bed into their new surroundings at Old Trafford, but the general consensus is they're ready-made signings who can have an instant impact. United will want to avoid a repeat of last season's dismal campaign and the signing of a defensive midfielder could play a major part in that.",
      "Given there'll be no European football for United this season, they can focus on the Premier League and winning some domestic silverware. Recent transfer speculation linking the club with Brighton midfielder Carlos Baleba are exciting links.",
      "The club is crying out for a holding midfielder who can protect the back three and stop the XI being so vulnerable in transition. However, given Brighton have slapped a reported £100million asking price on the Cameroonian's head, the club know they need to offload a number of fringe players before investing that kind of money.",
      "United's transfer spend already exceeds £200million and spending that much on one player would be a huge commitment. Which is why Adam Wharton would be a brilliant alternative signing.",
      "Of course, Palace themselves would want a huge transfer fee, previously valued at around £60million. It's fair to say that his value is only going to increase after shining in the FA Cup-winning run last season and more recently in the Community Shield triumph over Liverpool.",
      "CIES Football Observatory, who use a sample of more than 8,000 past transfers, the website evaluates prices of players from the five major European top-flights using the statistical technique of multiple linear regression - with fees paid by clubs as an independent variable, believe the former Blackburn Rovers player should be valued more in the region of €32million (£27.7m) to €37m (£32m).",
      "Even if United have to pay in excess of £60million, that should be considered a bargain for one of Europe's top midfielders and a rising star in English football.",
      "The current United ownership have stressed the importance of not making similar mistakes in the transfer market, given their torrid fall from grace. And yet, taking inspiration from the Sir Alex Ferguson era at Old Trafford could see them restore their place at England's top table.",
      "Under Ferguson, United would have the best of English talents - Wayne Rooney, Rio Ferdinand, Paul Scholes, Michael Carrick. Wharton has the potential to be right among that calibre of players.",
      "Also just 21-years-old, his best years are ahead of him and if continues to perform as he has for Palace, it's only a matter of time before a top club comes calling. Manchester United should be at the front of the queue.",

      "After missing the Gunners' 3-2 defeat to Villarreal at the Emirates Stadium last Wednesday, some supporters were hopeful of seeing the Belgian back in action for Saturday's 3-0 win over Athletic Club.",
      "However, he was again absent from the matchday squad, sparking fears he could miss the Premier League curtain-raiser at Old Trafford.",
      "Arteta, though, is confident he will be in contention to make the squad for the clash with United, explaining: \"I think he's going to be [okay] in a few days, yes, a little niggle in the groin. But he should be fine.\"",
      "Trossard featured in all three of Arsenal's tour friendlies, starting the 3-2 win over Newcastle United and coming off the bench against both AC Milan and Tottenham.",
      "The 30-year-old, who joined Arsenal from Brighton & Hove Albion in 2023, was a regular fixture for the Londoners last season, making 56 appearances across all competitions, chipping in with 10 goals and 10 assists.",
      "Trossard scored the winner for Arsenal when they won 1-0 at Old Trafford in the Premier League in May last year.",
      "Elsewhere, the only other injury concern playing on Arteta's mind ahead of the trip to M16 is Gabriel Jesus, who has not played since January and remains a long-term absentee.",

      "The options of playing for the Under-21s or going out on loan were considered, but the current indicators suggest that Leon will contribute to United's first-team squad this season.",
      "Leon made a strong first impression at Carrington and was handed a first-team squad number (30) before the opening pre-season friendly against Leeds in Stockholm. Ruben Amorim started Leon in that friendly and he made substitute appearances against West Ham and Bournemouth in the United States.",
      "The 18-year-old has now switched squad number, changing to No.35, with Benjamin Sesko expected to inherit his former number, but that does not mean Leon has been demoted.",

      "Each day we’re ranking the top 20 rumours involving Premier League clubs, the higher the link, the more likely we feel they are to become done deals.",
      "So we start with the tittle-tattle…",
      "",
      "20) 🔼 Cole Palmer – Chelsea to Manchester City\nAll signs point to this being utter horse sh*t, but with these two clubs, you never quite know. Chelsea would sell if the deal was right because business, and City have form for doing daft things. But surely even they wouldn’t do £200million-plus-£50million for a player they sold for £40million two years ago.",
      "",
      "19) Rodrygo – Real Madrid to Manchester City\nWith Grealish gone and interest in Savinho, we could see this happening. And it’s great news for Real, with City, Liverpool and Arsenal threatening a bidding war that didn’t look likely at the start of the summer.",
      "MORE ON THE SUMMER 2025 TRANSFER WINDOW\n👉 Every Premier League transfer and release confirmed in the summer of 2025\n👉 Twenty biggest transfers in the world in 2025 summer transfer window\n👉 Biggest spenders in the 2025 summer transfer window",
      "",
      "18) 🆕 Ibrahima Konate – Liverpool to Chelsea\nThere are whispers that Chelsea will offer £43million for Konate in the wake of Levi Colwill’s knee injury. Liverpool would prefer not to sell to a Premier League rival, but it would see them avoid losing the centre-back for nothing next summer. And they could immediately transfer the cash to Palace for Marc Guehi. So it makes a lot of sense, if they can just park the thought of aiding Chelsea.",
      "",
      "17) 🔽 Carlos Baleba – Brighton to Manchester United\nBaleba would make United a very passable football team. But United are dealing with Brighton, which isn’t easy even when they aren’t reluctant to sell. Apparently, their preference is to hold on to the midfielder for another year before banking another record fee. If United – and Baleba, if that is his preference – can force the issue, they should. But, knowing what we do about both clubs, we just can’t see it this summer. United are still trying, though, bless ’em.",
      "",
      "16) 🆕 Savinho – Manchester City to Tottenham Hotspur\nApparently, Spurs are very keen on the City winger, though the reports that £43million might do the trick appear to be wide of the mark. Pep Guardiola seems to trust Savinho and we can’t imagine that selling the 21-year-old was part of the plan for this summer. Which makes us wonder what City might be up to…",
      "",
      "15) 🔽 Gianluigi Donnarumma – PSG to Manchester United\nThe Italian goalkeeper is in the final 12 months of his contract and has said goodbye to the PSG fans after being ostracised by an unnamed person (it’s Luis Enrique). He looks destined for the Premier League, but United aren’t his most likely destination.",
      "",
      "14) Jorgen Strand Larsen – Wolves to Newcastle\nLarsen could be the next player to get the opportunity to snub Newcastle while they continue to tread on rakes. There have been whispers of the Toon’s interest in the striker throughout the summer, and Wolves could see an opportunity to milk their desperation. Nantes’ Matthis Abline is being eyed as a possible replacement should Newcastle come for Larsen.",
      "",
      "13) 🆕 Rasmus Hojlund – Manchester United to AC Milan\nPre-Sesko, the noises coming from Hojlund suggested he wanted to stay at United. Then he watched the Sesko unveiling before staying on the bench for the entirety of the draw with Fiorentina, all of which seems to have opened his mind more to the idea of joining AC Milan. The obvious problem for United: Milan can’t afford the £40million being asked. Mercifully for them, it seems there is a queue starting to form in Italy, with Inter, Roma, Juve and Napoli all jostling for position.",
      "",
      "12) 🔽 Harvey Elliott – Liverpool to Tottenham\nThomas Frank was, well, frank in admitting that Spurs will need a replacement for James Maddison after the playmaker was ruled out for much of the season with an ACL injury. This makes sense if the two clubs can make the numbers work. And Liverpool want that number to be at least £40million. RB Leipzig are keen. The Germans are unlikely to compete in a bidding war but they could offer a buy-back option which is said to be part of the conditions Liverpool have laid out.",
      "",
      "11) Dango Ouattara – Bournemouth to Brentford\nApparently, the Bees are one of a few clubs to have been in touch about the 23-year-old, who has told Bournemouth that he wants to explore his options. With all due respect, though, we doubt he had Brentford in mind when he was thinking about taking the next step.",
      "",
      "10) Alexander Isak – Newcastle to Liverpool\nIsak is employing a scorched earth approach to getting out of Newcastle, leaving his legacy in tatters by refusing to play for the club again or reintegrate with Eddie Howe’s squad. It’s a ballsy approach – a d*ckish one too – and Isak needs to hope his desire is matched by Liverpool. We expect a move will happen because it’s in neither the player nor Newcastle’s interest to stay together, but the Toon need something they can present as a win, like a British transfer record fee up front. Not one made up of countless add-ons if Isak wins the Ballon d’Or or Grand National.",
      "RANKING: Isak crashes into best available strikers ranking as Liverpool eye £130m Newcastle rebel",

      "9) 🆕 Gianluigi Donnarumma – PSG to Manchester City\nDonnarumma will definitely leave PSG. Where he ends up is less certain, but City are the current frontrunners…",
      "",
      "8) Eberechi Eze – Crystal Palace to Arsenal\nEze is the Gunners’ next top target and the England star has, apparently, been telling his mates he’s moving to the Emirates, but Arsenal are yet to deliver on Palace’s clear demand for his £68million buy-out clause to be met. And their dithering could leave the door open for…",
      "",
      "7) Eberechi Eze – Crystal Palace to Tottenham\nSpurs’ need for attacking reinforcements is clear and multiple reports suggest they have opened talks about a move for Eze. They, though, do not intend to pay the amount necessary to trigger the England star’s buy-out clause. And the feeling is Eze would prefer Arsenal, which gives Spurs a brief window to strike a deal while their north London neighbours attempt to raise the necessary cash through sales.",
      "",
      "6) 🔽 Tyler Dibling – Southampton to Everton\nDavid Moyes has voiced his concerns about the Toffees’ lack of transfer activity, and his bosses have taken note. Dibling is reportedly the subject of a £35million-plus-£8million offer, but the Saints want more up front. Dibling has been withdrawn from some aspects of training and wasn’t included in Will Still’s squad for their Championship opener, though, so a deal cannot be far off. Could Jack Grealish’s arrival impact things?",
      "",
      "5) 🔼 Yoane Wissa – Brentford to Newcastle\nEveryone seems to be turning down Newcastle recently, but Wissa is one player who does want to join the Magpies. Strongly enough to go up against Brentford while they rebuff the Toon’s interest. At least until the offers reach around £40million. The best Newcastle have come up so far is £25million but an improved offer is expected this week. They would be wise not to waste theirs and Brentford’s time with another low-ball bid.",
      "",
      "4) Xavi Simons – RB Leipzig to Chelsea\nA Chelsea move appeals to Simons and the Blues are keen to make it happen. They are hoping Leipzig take back £40million-rated Christopher Nkunku as part of the deal.",
      "",
      "3) 🔼 Alejandro Garnacho – Manchester United to Chelsea\nIt’s ‘Chelsea or nowhere’ in Garnacho’s mind and, to be honest, we’re curious to see what ‘nowhere’ looks like. Of course, it won’t reach that stage because United want rid as much as the winger wants out. All of which Chelsea know and they will take their sweet time to get the best possible terms. United wanted at least £40million; we think they will settle for less as the deadline approaches.",
      "",
      "2) 🔼 Marc Guehi – Crystal Palace to Liverpool\nPalace admit they may have to sell Guehi this summer rather than lose a £40million-rated asset for nothing in a year. Liverpool’s struggles in defence against the Eagles in the Community Shield ought to refocus their minds, especially with Chelsea pondering how to fill the void left by Levi Colwill’s injury; not so especially Manchester United’s ‘official approach’ for which huge fistfuls of salt are required. Alas, their interest has intensified and personal terms reportedly agreed.",
      "",
      "1) 🔼 James McAtee – Manchester City to Nottingham Forest\nIt looks like Forest will win the race for McAtee, who has attracted interest from Germany. Reports suggest he’ll cost north of £20m having agreed personal terms with the City Ground club."

Full-backs Jeremie Frimpong and Milos Kerkez have joined for £29.5m and £40m respectively, and we have also added the £25m on Giorgi Mamardashvili as that transfer will be counted in this summer’s accounts."

      "Manchester United are considering a loan move for Paris Saint-Germain goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma, according to reports.",
      "United have focused heavily on attacking reinforcements this summer, bringing in Matheus Cunha from Wolves, Bryan Mbeumo from Brentford and Benjamin Sesko from RB Leipzig.",
      "Attention is now turning to other areas of Ruben Amorim’s squad, with goalkeeper reportedly identified as a position the club could strengthen if the right opportunity arises.",
      "That opportunity could be presented by Donnarumma’s situation at PSG.",
      "MORE: Who will be the next Man Utd manager if Ruben Amorim is sacked?",
      "The Italy international was a key figure as Luis Enrique’s side won the Treble in 2024/25, keeping 17 clean sheets in 47 appearances. However, he has been left out of Wednesday’s squad for the UEFA Super Cup final against Tottenham Hotspur, after the signing of Lucas Chevalier, who is set to become first choice.",
      "With Donnarumma entering the final year of his £300,000-a-week contract, PSG are ‘ready to move him on’ this summer, according to GiveMeSport.",
      "United are understood to be ‘open to taking advantage’ of the situation with a loan offer, with a permanent deal ‘difficult to sanction’.",
      "That stance is largely due to the presence of Andre Onana, with the club reluctant to have two high-earning goalkeepers on their books.",
      "The Red Devils have explored potential exits for the Cameroon international, with interest from Saudi Arabia and AS Monaco earlier in the window, but no agreement has been reached.",
      "The website suggests that United could look to move Onana out on loan, or even keep him to compete with Donnarumma if a financially viable loan arrangement with PSG can be struck.",
      "PSG are not presently open to a loan move for the 26-year-old, preferring to secure a permanent sale. However, the Italian international is unhappy with how he has been treated, which has caught the attention of city rivals Manchester City.",
      "Should any other club attempt to sign Donnarumma permanently, then United’s chances of landing him on loan should be dashed.",
      "The report states:",
      "Any loan deal for the former AC Milan stopper would mean PSG need to change their stance on a loan move though, as PSG are not currently open to that situation. However, the player is disappointed with the way he has been dealt with this summer and it’s possible he could push for an exit on his own terms.",
      "United know what it’s like to get stuck with players they’ve been keen to move, and they could look to use that experience by negotiating terms with PSG that are favorable for all parties.",
      "However, there is a threat that any loan move could fall apart if another club made an offer to sign the player permanently instead, as that is PSG’s preferred option. Premier League rivals Chelsea and Manchester City have both been linked with an interest in the 26-year-old, but sources understand nothing of substance has happened in either case so far.",

      "The 22-year-old seems determined to prove himself at Old Trafford and is reluctant to leave.",
      "He said last month: “I am still very young, people sometimes forget that. I am only 22 years old. I have learned a lot, and I think that shows in my game.",

      "Indeed, the United man is ‘the hottest prospect’ with a €4million net salary, compared to Vlahovic’s €12m per year.",
      "Discussions are ongoing but the ‘draft agreement on the deal’s formula and figures’ is confirmed, with United agreeing to loan Hojlund out in a deal worth €6m.",

      "It’s added, however, that ‘a transfer market meeting took place today’ (Tuesday) between Hojlund and the Red Devils hierarchy, with the club emphasising their desire for him to move.",
      "Milan might have to move on to alternative targets, which include the more expensive Vlahovic and Paris Saint-Germain’s Goncalo Ramos.",

      "It is therefore this absolutely adequate away kit that ends up the spare wheel. There is quite literally nothing wrong with this at all, but the other West Ham kits simply have more that is right.",

      "And while we’re on the subject: just look at that badge. We are suckers for a club crest re-rendered in the appropriate colourway for an away kit and this is just an absolutely fabulous example of it. More excellent use here of that lighter blue that really pulls the whole kit together.",

The vibrant yellow and navy is a classic Tottenham change kit colourway, the Total 90 template remains sensational even if we do find the very idea that anything from a year beginning with a ‘2’ might now be considered fair game for raking in the retro-nostalgia coin slightly uncomfortable.",

      "We’ve said it before and we’ll say it again: if you must deploy a central club crest, you simply must also centralise the maker’s mark. It’s a basic question of balance.

      "We like this one a lot, especially for the clever use of the ‘snowflake’ imprint. It’s a motif whose association with United goes all the way back to that belting early ’90s away kit, and a design adidas have since leant on for United with even more enthusiasm than they have Arsenal and the lightning bolt. They even did it last season and have gone back to the well again.",
      "But if it works, it works. And what they’ve done for United here that maybe isn’t quite so true of the (nevertheless strikingly excellent) Arsenal away kit is do something new and different with it. In this case that means making it all massive.",

      "Andre Onana had a poor season, like many of his Man Utd colleagues, and there have been calls from some sections of supporters to replace the Cameroon international.",
      "And widespread reports indicate that Man Utd are looking to sign a midfielder and a goalkeeper in the final weeks of the transfer window after completing deals for Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo, Benjamin Sesko and Diego Leon.",
      "Paris Saint-Germain’s Donnarumma and Aston Villa’s Emiliano Martinez have been the two main names linked to Man Utd in recent weeks as they look to give Onana some serious competition.",
      "Chelsea have shown interest in Italy international Donnarumma but transfer expert Fabrizio Romano revealed on Tuesday that he is no longer a target for the Blues.",
      "Romano wrote on X: ‘Chelsea are not in active talks to sign Gigio Donnarumma despite links. He’s not a target as Chelsea are happy with their goalkeepers.’",
      "READ: Liverpool clash with Newcastle and Chelsea while Forest dominate the most bitter games this season",
      "There is also interest from Man City, who could allow Ederson to leave this summer, although Pep Guardiola’s side have already signed James Trafford from Burnley this summer.",
      "And TBR Football journalist Graeme Bailey has revealed that Donnarumma “will move to England” and has confirmed that Man Utd are still interested.",
      "Bailey told the website: “Donnarumma being left out of the Super Cup squad is a real statement of intent – am told that the Italian has been told by PSG that he is no longer wanted at the club, they have now moved on from him with Lucas Chevalier.",
      "“They are fully backing Chevalier and don’t want that pressure of Donnarumma hanging around – PSG don’t want him hanging around to go on a free transfer next summer, they want this chapter to end his month.",
      "“Speaking to those around PSG and to Donnarumma’s camp, the belief is that he will move to England.”",
      "Bailey added: “Manchester United, as we have revealed, have an interest; they wanted to improve their goalkeeping department this summer, and two options they like are Donnarumma and Emi Martinez, but a deal for the Italian is there for them, in theory, to do.",
      "“But others are looking – I am told Donnarumma’s camp have spoken to Chelsea and Manchester City. City, for their part, are in talks with Galatasaray, who were keen on Donnarumma, over Ederson.",

      "Man Utd have been responsible for three of the 20 biggest signings ever involving defenders, while rejecting then buying another who is in the top ten twice.",
      "",
      "1) Harry Maguire – £80m/€97m (Leicester to Man Utd, August 2019)\nAfter vetoing a summer 2018 move for Maguire because of a reticence to pay a potential world-record fee for a defender, Man Utd paid a very much real world-record fee for a defender to sign the Leicester centre-half the following year. And it would probably take about a quarter of that to tempt them into selling now.",
      "",
      "2) Josko Gvardiol – £77m/€89m (Leipzig to Manchester City, August 2023)\nA standout World Cup for Croatia and another season of Bundesliga excellence – although Lionel Messi and Erling Haaland tried their utmost to ruin both respectively – finally earned Gvardiol his long-awaited Premier League move for less than the original world-record demands.",
      "",
      "3) Virgil van Dijk – £75m/€84m (Southampton to Liverpool, January 2018)\nThe benchmark was set by Van Dijk, who claimed “I can’t do anything about the price” before doing everything to justify it, helping Liverpool reach a Champions League final within his first few months, winning the lot by his fourth year and raking in awards and acclaim in equal measure.",
      "",
      "4) Wesley Fofana – £70m/€80.4m (Leicester to Chelsea, August 2022)\nIt took three rejected Chelsea bids – worth £50m, £60m and finally £70m with add-ons included – before Leicester finally caved and accepted up to £75m for a defender with 57 top-flight career league appearances. Even before Fofana’s serious knee issues, it wasn’t exactly going to plan.",
      "",
      "5) Lucas Hernandez – £68m/€80m (Atletico Madrid to Bayern Munich, July 2019)\nBayern Munich’s record signing was a bit of a dud, reaching just over 100 games in four years but watching the entire 2020 Champions League final win from the bench and being sold at a considerable loss to PSG.",
      "",
      "6) Matthijs de Ligt – £67.8m/€75m (Ajax to Juventus, July 2019)\nWhen the vultures picked at the carcass of Ajax in 2019, De Jong and De Ligt were the parts deemed most succulent. Man Utd might have had their ridiculous reasons for turning the latter down before signing him years later, but Juventus were not put off by his father’s weight; after three underwhelming years they might wish they had been.",
      "",
      "7) Ruben Dias – £65m/€71.6m (Benfica to Manchester City, September 2020)\nTwo days after Jamie Vardy scored a hat-trick in a 5-2 humbling of Manchester City, Pep Guardiola took his Etihad spending on defenders beyond £400m on one of the best of the lot.",
      "",
      "8) Matthijs de Ligt – £62m/€70m (Juventus to Bayern Munich, July 2022)\n“I was still really young. I went from a kid who did everything well at Ajax to a defender at Juventus, where every little thing I did wrong was seen by everybody,” De Ligt has said of his brief time in Turin, which he swapped for a role out of the spotlight as the “boss” of Bayern’s defence for a couple of years.",
      "",
      "9) Achraf Hakimi – £60m/€71m (Inter to Paris Saint-Germain, July 2021)\nAfter playing for Real Madrid, Borussia Dortmund and Inter, Hakimi had enough of representing clubs with European pedigree and so rocked up in Paris to win a few domestic trophies and keep Kylian Mbappe company for a bit. Then Mbappe left and PSG won the sodding big one after Hakimi’s muted celebration kicked off a Champions League final dismantling of former club Inter.",
      "",
      "10) Joao Cancelo – £60m/€65m (Juventus to Manchester City, August 2019)\nSwapping places with Danilo, Cancelo went from bit-part player to one of the best in the league, then suddenly a Bayern Munich and Barcelona loanee and Saudi import, all within five ludicrous years.",
      "",
      "11) Aymeric Laporte – £57m/€65m (Athletic Bilbao to Manchester City, January 2018)\nAfter Manchester City balked at the numbers involved in procuring Van Dijk from Southampton, they simply switched them around and went for Laporte in a club-record move instead. It went less well but still OK.",
      "",
      "12) Marc Cucurella – £55m/€68m (Brighton to Chelsea, August 2022)\nIt doesn’t feel as though the add-ons potentially taking this deal to £63m were activated in a dreadful couple of years for Cucurella the individual and the Chelsea collective. European Championship glory with Spain sparked a turnaround at club level.",
      "",
      "13) Illia Zabarnyi – £54.3m/€63m (Bournemouth to Paris Saint-Germain, August 2025)\nAndoni Iraola would have preferred not to lose his entire centre-half pairing in the same summer Bournemouth also sold their left-back and returned their loanee keeper. But that is the model and such a phenomenal stepping stone must appeal to players.",
      "",
      "14) Leny Yoro – £52.1m/€61.8m (Lille to Man Utd, July 2024)\nAnother £7m in add-ons is built into a deal which saw Manchester United ‘outmanoeuvre’ Real Madrid and Liverpool by spending sums other clubs absolutely did not want to spend on an 18-year-old with 60 first-team career appearances.",
      "",
      "15) Benjamin Mendy – £52m/€57.5m (Monaco to Manchester City, July 2017)\nAn incredibly rare misstep for a Manchester City side which tends to spend such considerable sums well.",
      "",
      "16) David Luiz – £50m/€62.5m (Chelsea to Paris Saint-Germain, June 2014)\nDomestic Quadruples were won in both his full seasons in Paris, before Chelsea bought the Brazilian straight back for £16m less.",
      "",
      "17) Dean Huijsen – £50m/€59.4m (Bournemouth to Real Madrid, June 2025)\nA ridiculous success story for Bournemouth, who plucked Huijsen from a panicking Juventus and flipped a huge profit on the Spanish centre-half within a single season when Real Madrid came calling.",
      "",
      "18) Benjamin White – £50m/€58m (Brighton to Arsenal, July 2021)\nArsenal started the bidding at £42m and had five offers turned down before acquiescing to Brighton’s initial demand for a guaranteed £50m, and all parties can be happy with their lot.",
      "",
      "19) John Stones – £50m/€57m (Everton to Manchester City, August 2016)\nReckon it might be safe to assume the £2.5m in add-ons have been achieved for a brilliant defender and apparently even better midfielder, even if various parts of him are made of glass.",
      "",
      "20) Kyle Walker £50m/€56.7m (Tottenham to Manchester City, July 2017)\nIt seemed preposterous at the time but the only absurd thing six years on is just how much Walker won as a trusted Guardiola lieutenant before both player and club sought something new.",

      "The Red Devils have drastically improved their attack this summer with Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko all joining Ruben Amorim’s squad this summer.",

      "The Athletic‘s David Ornstein and Laurie Whitwell also brought an update on Tuesday with Man Utd ‘continuing to explore whether a move’ for Baleba ‘can be agreed this summer’.",
      "Brighton ‘do not intend to sell the 21-year-old in this market’ but Man Utd ‘are determined to reshape Ruben Amorim’s squad as much as possible in his first summer transfer window, and adding a top-level No 6 has been central to the club’s plans’.",
      "The report adds: ‘A number of United players have been in contact with Baleba about a transfer to Old Trafford, explaining the current landscape and ambitions.’",

      "But there are two more potential destinations for Sancho in Italy, which could hurt Juventus.",
      "Said to not be ‘short of options’, Sancho is on the radar of Inter Milan, with an intermediary having held meetings to discuss the winger’s salary and the potential transfer fee.",
      "But Inter are still holding out for the signing of Ademola Lookman, so with him as the plan A, Sancho is simply a back-up option.",

      "However, Sancho was playing UEFA Conference League last season, where he scored twice and assisted five times, which included a goal in the final.",

      "9) Leeds v Sunderland – The Summer Spend derby\nWhile sacking Peter Reid and flirting with financial implosion was the strongest common denominator between Leeds and Sunderland prior to this summer, promotion has pulled them closer together despite being remarkably far apart in their approach to Premier League preparation.",
      "Leeds have recruited sensibly if slowly, focusing on defensive additions to solidify their spine and avoid having to make another panicked May phone call to Sam Allardyce.",
      "Fees have been spent on a goalkeeper, two centre-halves, a left-back and two more defensive-minded midfielders. The free agent Lukas Nmecha has been their only attacking signing after a move for Igor Paixao proved too difficult.",
      "Sunderland have taken a slightly different view, albeit out of necessity due to a less prepared squad and to offset sales. Only seven clubs in the entire world have spent more than the Black Cats this summer, with Habib Diarra becoming their record signing.",
      "Trying to achieve the impossible feat of surviving in the Premier League as a promoted club already pitted Leeds and Sunderland against each other; that dichotomy in perceived ambition has stoked the flames for some.",
      "",
      "8) Chelsea v Liverpool – The Tribunal To Determine Compensation derby\nAmong the many words used were ‘seething’ and ‘furious’ when Chelsea had what they felt was ‘a generational talent’ snatched from under their noses in summer 2024.",
      "Their habitual hoarding of ludicrously prodigious teenaged wide forwards at least compensates the selling club fairly; the final amount Liverpool will pay for Ngumoha is unknown but his pre-season performances suggest it won’t be commensurate to his ability and potential.",
      "The results of a tribunal to determine the compensation owed to Chelsea have not been disclosed but previous such hearings have only returned pay-outs of up to £10m, a valuation Ngumoha might well far exceed by the end of a season in which he only turns 17.",
      "A clear first-team pathway at Liverpool was crucial in the forward’s decision to move to Anfield and Arne Slot has already outlined the role Ngumoha can play across four competitions of a gruelling season.",
      "Chelsea will be keeping a keen eye, although arguably should have done so far sooner.",
      "",
      "7) Aston Villa v Manchester United – The Selection Methodology derby, ft. Emi Martinez and maybe Ollie Watkins\n“Aston Villa can confirm the club has written to the PGMOL to raise concerns over the selection process of match officials following today’s game with Manchester United at Old Trafford.",
      "“With such high stakes surrounding today’s fixture, the club believe a more experienced referee should have been appointed. Of the 10 referees to officiate across the Premier League today, Mr. Bramall was the second least experienced.”",
      "It was a wonderfully impotent announcement issued by an Aston Villa side who, by their own account, “acknowledge that the outcome for us will not change, but we believe that it is important to address the selection methodology to ensure that high stakes matches are treated as such”.",
      "The PGMOL response never was revealed but could well have amounted to Howard Webb pointing out they should probably just have beaten a Manchester United side which had already lost 22 games last season by then, regardless of the referee chosen.",
      "Unai Emery hinted that Thomas Bramall had apologised for his “huge mistake” but the consequences of Villa failing to leave Old Trafford with the single point they needed for Champions League qualification are still being felt.",
      "Evann Guessand of Nice has been their only significant first-team signing and there has been a clear reluctance to make the same player PSR sacrifices which defined their summer of 2024.",
      "Emi Martinez was one of those made available for transfer but Manchester United rubbed salt in that wound by only asking for him on loan.",
      "",
      "6) Brentford v Newcastle – The Broken Promises derby\nAn alternative name pitch might be The Hypocrisy derby, so wonderfully has Newcastle’s entire transfer window captured the perennial insincerity at the very heart of football fandom.",
      "Alexander Isak is a treacherous, villainous turncoat who has betrayed Newcastle, been misadvised and refused to train, play or join the club on tour after having his head turned and ear burned by supposed broken promises about being allowed to go.",
      "Yoane Wissa just wants to leave Brentford and is being held against his will.",
      "These contortions and contradictions are a necessary part of supporting a club but a Brentford side already pillaged by richer and bigger teams must have enjoyed any and all attempts to paint Newcastle as an innocent victim of the hierarchy this summer.",
      "",
      "5) Newcastle v Manchester United – The Transfer Food Chain derby\nThe Magpies have, however, been reminded of their place in that food chain to an uproariously chastening degree.",
      "Their best version in a generation, arguably ever, has been routinely upstaged by the worst modern iteration of Manchester United by an absurd margin.",
      "Champions League qualification and a trophy has been outweighed by the very fact Old Trafford is crumbling and players would prefer to be part of rebuilding it rather than having to call Jason Tindall ‘Bossman’.",
      "The semantics on Matheus Cunha can and have been debated but Newcastle were absolutely interested in Bryan Mbeumo before the player removed himself from their equation after Ruben Amorim’s admiring glances, while the moves were put on Benjamin Sesko before his public rejection of the Eddie Howe project.",
      "Newcastle still and will always have a win in the Alan Shearer battle of 1996, but their war over signings with Manchester United incurred some really quite embarrassing casualties in 2025.",
      "",
      "4) Manchester United v Brentford – The Refuse To Be Held For Ransom derby\nThe most high-profile of these disputes this summer have largely involved the same set of clubs cast in different roles: Newcastle as both victim and aggressor; Nottingham Forest as predator and prey.",
      "Manchester United trying to pretend they were fighting the good fight against Brentford was a curious development but Sir Jim Ratcliffe has to get his kicks somewhere and if it doesn’t involve people losing jobs we should take it.",
      "There were 44 days between Manchester United bidding £45m plus £10m in add-ons for Mbeumo and agreeing a deal at £65m plus £6m in add-ons.",
      "The intervening weeks were filled with intermittent noise including a claim the buying club would not be held to ‘ransom’, which they eventually and inevitably were.",
      "But even upon the conclusion of the deal, Manchester United were not done. They leaked their fury with Brentford to the usual cabal of journalists after it emerged that the Bees shamefully tried to secure the best possible deal they could for their most valuable player.",
      "Good on little Manchester United for sticking it to big bad Brentford.",
      "",
      "3) Newcastle v Liverpool – The £150m Valuation derby\nWhen the signing of a potential £79m forward is only ever presented as a secondary plot point to the wider overall narrative, you know a lot of water has gathered under the bridge connecting Newcastle and Liverpool.",
      "A wise sage once referred to their rivalry as ‘toxic’ because of 1) some results, 2) Newcastle once poaching an analyst from Liverpool, 3) Liverpool being one of many clubs to oppose their takeover, and 4) Liverpool having spent some money more than four decades ago, but this summer did mark a definitive turn in their relationship.",
      "The Ekitike hijack could be forgiven by a club who have known nothing different in this transfer window. A target choosing to join someone else is part and parcel of the game, and losing a race to the Premier League champions who will be among the Champions League favourites can be brushed off quickly.",
      "But the Isak saga has cast an uncomfortable cloud over Newcastle’s summer and left a sour taste. Even when handed all the cards of a three-year contract with no release clause and no need to make a book-balancing sale, the Magpies have looked thoroughly unconvincing with their hard-line stance.",
      "They did land one shot with the loaded claim that Liverpool had ‘bottled’ their first and as yet only actual bid for Isak but there is a clear sense that even if he stays, the damage has been done.",
      "The best-case scenario for Newcastle is that they will be without their best player for the first couple of games of the season, and perhaps on a mental level well beyond that, before he recovers something close to the form which has made him so desirable.",
      "But bridges between player and club can be mended if not fixed completely; any club-to-club camaraderie has been torched.",
      "",
      "2) Nottingham Forest v Spurs – The Release Clause derby\nIt seems like an age since the capture of Mohammed Kudus was followed up with the stunning revelation that Spurs would be signing Morgan Gibbs-White the next day.",
      "More than a month has passed and not only have Spurs not invested that £60m elsewhere, they have also lost to a probable season-long injury the sort of player Gibbs-White would have shared the creative burden with.",
      "Daniel Levy still struggles to understand Spurs fans and was given a public crash course in Evangelos Marinakis this summer too. But the Spurs chairman has played the role of 2013 Arsenal impeccably, understandably but clearly mistakenly believing that triggering a release clause in the contract of a player keen to join would indeed be enough to procure them.",
      "One legal threat, renewed deal and announcement with the air of a hostage video later, all with Marinakis front and centre, Spurs were left wondering what had just happened while Forest merrily went about their business.",
      "Then it emerged that Marinakis felt ‘it would have been a backward step’ for Gibbs-White to leave the City Ground for Spurs and suddenly sacking Nuno or waiting to poach Brennan Johnson felt remarkably tame.",
      "",
      "1) Crystal Palace v Nottingham Forest – The Blind Trust derby\nA trick has been missed. There is a chance to rectify it, even if that would require some manoeuvring and would impact a few different clubs. But it must be done.",
      "One of the games between Crystal Palace and Nottingham Forest, currently scheduled for late August and January, must be moved to March 1. The narrative must be fed.",
      "It shouldn’t be that match at Selhurst Park on the season’s second weekend; that promises to be biblical. Palace’s first home game, their demotion from the Europa League for Forest to benefit still fresh, perhaps with the FA Cup and Community Shield paraded beforehand, played in between a pair of Conference League play-off qualifier legs, will have a glorious edge to it.",
      "Steve Parish certainly won’t be rushing to offer out any executive boxes.",
      "If Forest supporters aren’t already arranging chants of “decisive influence” to the ‘is there a fire drill?’ tune, or scribbling ‘Rules Are Rules’ on a crude Photoshop of Marinakis and John Textor shaking hands, then they too should have their Europa spot revoked.",
      "And if the losing team doesn’t take the result to the Court of Arbitration for Sport it’s worth wondering what we’re all doing here.",
      "According to reports, Nottingham Forest owner Evangelos Marinakis ‘erupted’ in a second clash with head coach Nuno Espirito Santo at the weekend.",
      "‘Scandalous from that Forest owner,’ said Gary Neville, but both owner and manager have downplayed the dressing-down.",
      "Nottingham Forest owner Evangelos Marinakis has stepped down from his role to avoid future complications if the club qualify for Europe."

      "Mo Salah won the Golden Boot as the Premier League top scorer in 2024/25 after Erling Haaland won in both 2022/23 and 2023/24. As it stands, the Norwegian is the favourite to regain his title.",
      "We bring you the top 10 favourites for the Golden Boot according to the latest odds; we will update once the Premier League goals start going in…",
      "",
      "10) Dominic Solanke (Tottenham)\nThe odds are long at 33/1 – he only scored nine Premier League goals last season – but he is still ahead of Omar Marmoush and Liam Delap among others. Perhaps the theory is that if Thomas Frank can coach a 20-goal campaign out of Bryan Mbeumo, he might just work wonders for Solanke. One thing we do know: The Golden Boot would get him on the plane to the World Cup.",
      "",
      "9) Ollie Watkins (Aston Villa)\nManchester United have decided that Benjamin Sesko for £74million makes more sense than Ollie Watkins for £50million; it feels like they may have made a familiar mistake just because he is the wrong side of 28. But he scored 16 Premier League goals last season and remains Villa’s first-choice striker (we presume), and he will be supremely motivated ahead of the 2026 World Cup.",
      "",
      "7=) Hugo Ekitike (Liverpool)\nOddly long odds – 25/1 – for the most expensive striker signing of the summer, but he did massively underscore according to his xG last season for Eintracht Frankfurt. Perhaps there is value to be found in backing Ekitike here; he did score in the Community Shield, after all.",
      "",
      "7=) Benjamin Sesko (Manchester United)\nSesko was the man left standing in the Manchester United striker position when the music stopped, but he scored only 13 Bundesliga goals in 24/25 so it feels like a massive ask for him to come to the Premier League and win the Golden Boot with a club that struggled with chance creation (and everything else) last season.",
      "",
      "5=) Cole Palmer (Chelsea)\nThe stand-out player as Chelsea won the Club World Cup but it’s tricky to envision a 15-goal Premier League season becoming the 25 goals – at least – necessary to win the Golden Boot. Mind you, we do think Chelsea might win the Premier League title after that summer.",
      "",
      "5=) Joao Pedro (Chelsea)\nLooked excellent for Chelsea at the Club World Cup and in pre-season, with the Brazilian seemingly ready to lead the line ahead of Delap. The Brazilian has never scored more than 10 Premier League goals before, but he has never played in the Premier League with Cole Palmer, Estevao, Jamie Gittens and Pedro Neto before.",
      "",
      "4) Alexander Isak (Newcastle United, for now)\nNow we hit the big boys. Isak is a 13/2 shot to win the Golden Boot despite the fact that he might not kick a ball in the Premier League until after the transfer window has closed. Will he eventually play for Newcastle United, Liverpool or (don’t laugh) Tottenham?",
      "",
      "2=) Mo Salah (Liverpool)\nThe Golden Boot holder broke several records on the final day of last season, but the Egyptian is now 33, it’s an Africa Cup of Nations season, and he’s no longer playing for a new contract.",
      "",
      "2=) Viktor Gyokeres (Arsenal)\nThe top scorer in 2024 is only being beaten in 2025 by Kylian Mbappe, but he is untested at this kind of level. The final piece of the Arsenal jigsaw? If that’s true, the Golden Boot trophy will surely come with a Premier League title win.",
      "",
      "1) Erling Haaland (Manchester City)\nWe all just assume he will be brilliant, right? Even after that embarrassing 22-goal season.",

      "The Magpies were also keen on Bryan Mbeumo, who moved to Old Trafford from Brentford earlier in the summer, and now could be beaten by the Red Devils to free agent Dominic Calvert-Lewin.",
      "Ben Jacobs revealed interest from Newcastle in Calvert-Lewin last month, writing on X: ‘Newcastle retain an interest in Dominic Calvert-Lewin, but are reticent to meet his terms. Nothing is advanced currently, nor has a new offer been presented to Calvert-Lewin so far. #NUFC are still assessing several options after missing out on Joao Pedro, and learning Callum Wilson would not extend.’",
      "‘A move will only progress if Calvert-Lewin reduces his terms from 12 months ago when #NUFC made a concrete offer. And even then, Newcastle are somewhat wary of Calvert-Lewin’s injury record.’",
      "Around the same time in early July, transfer expert Fabrizio Romano gave an update on Man Utd interest in Calvert-Lewin, he said: “What happened with Calvert-Lewin is that the player has been offered to Manchester United.",

      "CaughtOffside claimed on Sunday that Man Utd are considering the England international ‘as back-up option’, ‘exploring the possibility of adding Calvert-Lewin to Ruben Amorim’s squad as a depth option in attack’.",

      "By Laura Hunter",
      "Wednesday 13 August 2025 06:24, UK",
      "No 9s and No 10s have been the talk of the summer and big money has been spent in the pursuit of goals.",
      "Chelsea are hanging their hopes on Liam Delap and Joao Pedro, Arsenal have got all their eggs in the Viktor Gyokeres basket, while Man United have gone wild and revamped their entire forward line by signing Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko for a combined £207m.",
      "Liverpool have front-loaded, too, splashing a nine-figure sum on Florian Wirtz before pushing overall spending beyond the £250m mark with a £79m outlay on Hugo Ekitike.",
      "And we are yet to reach a conclusion on the Alexander Isak saga, with any potential fee for the Newcastle forward likely to eclipse anything we have seen so far. So, who has spent wisely? And how will each team best utilise their new weapons in the hunt for Premier League glory?",
      "After their worst season in 51 years, the only way is up for Man United and their shiny new three-pronged attack, moulded in the shape of Ruben Amorim's famous 3-4-2-1 system.",
      "Amorim always maintained, given the choice, he would not have taken on the unenviable task of awakening English football's most successful club from its decade-long malaise midway through a season, had the proposal not been 'now or never'.",
      "What followed was fairly disastrous: most defeats (18), fewest points (42) and fewest goals (44) in the club's Premier League history. But now, with a full pre-season to impart his particular style and the tools with which to make it succeed, can we expect an upturn?",
      "Mbeumo and Sesko are exciting additions. Both had offers from other clubs and still chose Man United, despite no participation in European competition for the first time in 11 years and no title since 2013.",
      "Sesko hit 21 goals in all competitions for RB Leipzig last season, finishing with 39 in 87 appearances overall. His pace, movement and sharp finishing should suit Amorim's fluid attack, with Mbeumo and Cunha doing the creative work.",
      "Some daunting early fixtures, with Arsenal, Manchester City and Chelsea in their opening five games, will stress test that theory. Clearly all three have proven pedigree - each is an obvious improvement on the luckless Rasmus Hojlund - but whether they offer the right balance of creativity to goal threat will have to be judged at a later date. Suffice to say, 44 is not a difficult tally to beat.",
      "Most believe both Wirtz and Ekitike to be the real deal despite their relatively modest ages. The latter scored 15 goals and assisted eight more in 33 Bundesliga games for Eintracht Frankfurt last season, while Wirtz just makes playing football look frightfully easy.",
      "Over the last two years, the German international landed 67 goal involvements in 75 matches across all competitions for Bayer Leverkusen, with an equally efficient split of 34 goals to 33 assists.",
      "Both are model forwards for fast transitions and have an ability to play between the lines, ready to complement Liverpool's already abundant attacking riches. Mohamed Salah's eyes must have lit up when Wirtz walked through the door at Melwood - a quick, skilful, progressive playmaker with shades of Kevin De Bruyne? Yes please.",
      "In Arne Slot style, expect aggressive counter-pressing too.",
      "Chemistry between Wirtz and Ekitike already shows outstanding promise. This is an ominous development in the evolution of Slot's incumbent champions.",
      "Let's be honest, Arsenal have been fudging it for years, somehow managing to get away with scoring enough goals to satisfy consecutive second-place finishes thanks to the brilliance of Bukayo Saka and Martin Odegaard. Not nearly enough for a title, though.",
      "Every transfer window teased a big-name signing without ever actually delivering on that pledge. Until now.",
      "Gyokeres \"will destroy defenders\", insisted Mikel Arteta last weekend. Perhaps the fact he has been given Thierry Henry's iconic #14 shirt is intentionally foreboding. Like the legendary Frenchman, Gyokeres thrives within the width of the posts. He has a desire to stay on the last line, complete with intimidating physicality and running power.",
      "A forward who can charge through defences and speed up attacks - scoring 23 times from fast breaks last year - will aid Arsenal's plight greatly. And most importantly, no player in Europe's top eight divisions matched Gyokeres' 39 league goals for Sporting.",
      "In fact, across his two seasons in Portugal, Gyokeres hit Erling Haaland-level numbers: 79 goals in 83 matches in the Primeira Liga and Champions League, proving he might very well be the missing piece in Arsenal's title-chasing dream.",
      "Chelsea's willingness to part with big sums of cash has been a transfer market staple ever since Todd Boehly took a controlling stake at Stamford Bridge just over three years ago.",
      "In the immediate aftermath of the introduction of the Premier League's PSR rules, they were the only club keeping the magic of the transfer window alive. Now others have caught up, but we still thank Boehly for plugging the intrigue gap.",
      "And yet Chelsea's latest spree is more interesting still, as newcomers Delap and Pedro jostle for first-choice striker. The Brazilian is arguably more mobile and dynamic than Delap, but has struggled to stay injury-free over the past 12 months.",

      "Delap, meanwhile, has already shown himself to be a good ally to Chelsea's greatest asset, Cole Palmer. The pair were prolific for Manchester City's youth teams in years gone by.",
      "Pedro and Delap, both on the scoresheet as Chelsea thrashed AC Milan in a recent pre-season friendly, registered a combined 30 goal contributions in the Premier League last season (22G, 8A) and that kind of firepower can sustain a meaningful title charge - at least beyond Christmas, which is realistically where Chelsea's ended last term.",

      "A Messi-like ability to open up a game is what was captured in glimpses for Lyon last season, particularly noticeable in Europa League performances, with 12 goal contributions from 11 starts.",
      "Of course, City do not need another marquee No 9 signing, they have Haaland, who will be buoyed by the addition of Cherki to supplement his own goal-scoring habits as City bid to forcibly reassert themselves back in the title picture. Things just got interesting.",

      "In his first interview as a Man Utd player, Sesko said: \"When we discussed the project, it was clear that everything is in place for this team to continue to grow and compete for the biggest trophies again soon.",
      "\"From the moment that I arrived, I could feel the positive energy and family environment that the club has created. It is clearly the perfect place to reach my maximum level and fulfil all of my ambitions.\"",

      "The forward's strong desire to join Man Utd was not lost on club officials - they have consistently said they only want players who want to be part of what they are trying to build, regardless of whether they can offer Champions League football or not.",
      "Director of football Jason Wilcox has played a key role in getting Sesko's deal over the line, while director of recruitment Christopher Vivell and chief negotiator Matt Hargreaves had been in Leipzig finalising the deal.",
      "Talking about the new signing, Wilcox said: \"Benjamin possesses a rare combination of electrifying pace and the ability to physically dominate defenders, making him one of the most exceptional young talents in world football.",
      "\"We have followed Benjamin's career closely; all of our data analysis and research concluded that he has the required qualities and personality to thrive at Manchester United.",

      "\"The desire that all of our new signings have shown to join the club this summer highlights the appeal and stature of Manchester United as we continue to build and develop a team capable of challenging for the biggest honours.\"",
      "Manchester United have been aware of Sesko ever since he moved to Red Bull Salzburg aged 16. They've scouted him for many years and this isn't actually the first time they have tried to sign him. In the summer of 2022 - three years ago now - there was some concrete interest from Man Utd.",
      "Sesko reached an agreement to join Leipzig a year later instead. That was because he didn't feel ready to make that jump to a club in the Premier League. He has now made that big move.",
      "What makes Sesko so appealing?",
      "Sesko scored 39 goals in 87 games for RB Leipzig after joining them from Red Bull Salzburg two years ago, but what qualities will the 22-year-old bring to the Premier League?",
      "And could he really be the next Erling Haaland?",
      "Read Nick Wright's feature here.",
      "Sesko's signing will raise further questions over Rasmus Hojlund's future at Old Trafford. It is understood the club would consider offers of around £40m for the player, and AC Milan are interested.",
      "It was thought United would have to make sales in order to bring in a striker. However, while the priority is to offload players, it is understood they can buy before selling, provided there are sales before the window closes.",
      "It is understood Leipzig are also interested in Hojlund and have explored the conditions of a loan. Leipzig had proposed taking the striker on loan as part of any possible deal for Sesko.",
      "Hojlund has started two of Manchester United's four pre-season games so far and scored in their 4-1 win over Bournemouth, but the arrival of a new striker could limit his game time.",

      "Manchester United have signed Benjamin Sesko from RB Leipzig; Slovenia international striker has impressed in Germany and drawn style and stature comparisons with Manchester City's Erling Haaland",
      "Saturday 9 August 2025 23:57, UK",
      "Manchester United have beaten Newcastle to the signing of Benjamin Sesko, while Arsenal were also interested in him - so what makes the striker so appealing?",
      "Sesko scored 39 goals in 87 games for RB Leipzig after joining them from Red Bull Salzburg two years ago but what qualities will the 22-year-old bring to the Premier League?",
      "And could he really be the next Erling Haaland?",
      "Here we take a closer look at Man Utd's new £73.7m frontman...",
      "His scoring record is modest by comparison but Sesko is a rare breed of striker with a similar physical profile to Haaland. At 6ft 4in, he is exactly the same height and similarly quick.",
      "His stature allows him to play the role of a targetman, holding the ball up, bringing team-mates into play and providing an outlet for long passes, crosses and set-piece deliveries.",
      "Like Haaland, he combines those qualities with explosive pace.",
      "Last season in the Bundesliga, Sesko's top speed of 35.69 km/h put him 26th among 492 players to feature in the competition. He ranked even higher in the previous campaign, at 15th.",
      "His pace no doubt formed a significant part of his appeal to Newcastle as they face the potential prospect of having to replace Alexander Isak, though it is Manchester United who have added more explosiveness to their attack following the signing of Bryan Mbeumo from Brentford.",
      "Sesko's speed can stretch and destabilise defences. It is also a devastating weapon on the break and on transitions, something he has demonstrated throughout his time in Germany.",
      "RB Leipzig are known as one of the country's most effective counter-attacking teams - their total of 17 counter-attack goals since the start of last season is the second-highest among Bundesliga sides, behind only Eintracht Frankfurt - and Sesko has been a big part of it.",
      "His total of five fast-break goals across the last two Bundesliga seasons puts him third in the division, behind his RB Leipzig team-mate Lois Openda and former Eintracht Frankfurt forward Omar Marmoush, who have scored six each.",
      "Sesko's most recent example came during a 3-3 draw with Bayern Munich in May, when he accelerated away from Eric Dier to latch onto a Xavi Simons pass and send a superb, first-time finish past stranded goalkeeper Jonas Urbig from long range.",
      "That attack saw the ball travel from the edge of RB Leipzig's box to the back of the Bayern Munich net in a matter of seconds and it was enabled by the speed and ruthless efficiency of Sesko.",
      "It is also worth noting that it is not just in open spaces that Sesko is able to carry the ball upfield.",
      "Unusually for a player of his stature, Sesko is also an accomplished dribbler with the technical skill to beat defenders in tight spaces before accelerating towards goal.",
      "His average of 1.46 successful take-ons per 90 minutes was in fact the highest of any out-and-out striker in the Bundesliga last season, highlighting another area of strength.",
      "Sesko's scoring rate dipped slightly as RB Leipzig endured a poor campaign last term but his penchant for the spectacular remains, thanks largely to his outstanding ball-striking ability.",
      "That opening goal against Bayern Munich in May, curled around Urbig using the outside of his boot from 40 yards out, was one of four he has scored from outside the box in the Bundesliga since the start of last season. Only a handful of players have scored more.",
      "Even fewer can claim to have found the net from distance with the same level of ferocity.",
      "Sesko is able to generate astonishing power with his shots, as seen most memorably with his stunning strike against Werder Bremen in January, rifled into the top corner from 25 yards out. The ball was later revealed to have travelled at a speed of 126.43 km/h.",
      "That goal against Werder Bremen, like the one against Bayern five months later, was hit with his stronger right foot but he can muster similar power using his weaker foot too.",
      "Playing for Slovenia in a Nations League game against Sweden in September 2022, he scored a sensational, left-footed volley which drew comparisons with Marco van Basten.",
      "Sesko's willingness to shoot from improbable angles and unlikely positions can, on the flip side, be frustrating. His shot map for the last two Bundesliga seasons shows a high percentage of his shots were statistically unlikely to result in goals.",
      "It is also worth noting he has significantly overperformed relative to his expected goals at RB Leipzig, scoring 27 times in the Bundesliga from only 17.7 xG across the last two seasons. The numbers raise questions over whether his scoring rate is sustainable.",
      "At the same time, though, knowing what he is capable of, it is easy to see the logic behind his ambitious shot choices. Sesko has shown he can score from just about anywhere. His directness is another part of his appeal.",
      "Another of Sesko's biggest attributes is his prodigious leap.",
      "He was a promising basketball player in his teens and the agility honed on the court can now be seen in the way he challenges for headers and controls high balls on the pitch.",
      "Coupled with his height, it gives him an edge in the opposition box, as seen when he leapt above the outstretched hand of Eintracht Frankfurt goalkeeper Kevin Trapp to head home a rebound before Trapp could reach it during a 2-1 win in December.",
      "That goal was one of eight Sesko has scored with his head across the last two Bundesliga seasons. It is the fourth-highest total in the competition behind Harry Kane, Serhou Guirassy and Tim Kleindienst, and underlines the extent of his aerial threat.",
      "That threat is particularly pertinent to Manchester United as they aim to increase their set-piece threat. They rank as the Premier League's lowest scorers from set-pieces over the last three seasons.",
      "Sesko is not yet the finished article having only turned 22 at the end of May. Some elements of his game are still raw. His goals tend to come in bursts rather than consistently.",
      "This move to the Premier League will come with considerable pressure and high expectations but his age ensures he has plenty of room to grow and develop.",
      "There is of course an element of risk in signing Sesko ahead of a more established option. He does not boast the same prolific scoring record as Haaland when he made the move to England. Haaland had scored 86 goals in 89 games for Borussia Dortmund whereas Sesko has scored 39 goals in 87 games for RB Leipzig.",
      "But his potential is huge and the parallels in style are clear. The pair have even followed similar routes, with Sesko effectively brought in as Haaland's replacement at former club Red Bull Salzburg.",
      "It is also worth noting that, at only 22, Sesko has already amassed considerable experience, making more than 250 appearances for club and country, featuring at Champions League level, and reaching double figures for goals in five consecutive campaigns.",
      "He has done all that while avoiding any serious injury setbacks. That durability is another factor in his favour, and another source of encouragement to Manchester United.",
