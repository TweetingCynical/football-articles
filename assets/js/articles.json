      "Gary Neville has slammed Ruben Amorim for fostering an “excuse mentality” at Manchester United after the manager suggested negative comments from pundits was affecting his team.",
      "Amorim said his players were susceptible to taking media criticism to heart before the 2-0 win over Sunderland on Saturday. Neville and other high-profile ex-United players like Wayne Rooney and Paul Scholes have been open in their concerns about Amorim’s lack of tactical flexibility.",
      "The United manager has stubbornly stuck to his 3-4-2-1 formation and is convinced it will work out. But the 3-1 defeat by Brentford last weekend saw many openly questioning his job, which has been eased with the Sunderland victory.",
      "Neville has now responded to Amorim’s comments with a scathing rant about the culture at the club. “I’ve not got a lot of time for that. For a start, if pundits are getting in your head, you shouldn’t be playing for Manchester United. Simple as that,” he said on the Gary Neville podcast.",
      "“Do people not remember Alan Hansen criticising us, saying we’d win nothing with kids? That was the greatest and most successful centre-back of all time at that moment. Do they not think we got criticised during our careers? I’m sorry, you’re playing for Manchester United, it comes with the territory. You’ve got to step up.",
      "“Look, they’ve been hopeless in the system. Absolutely hopeless. Alright, it’s not the system, it’s you, the players, we can just start battering the players. I’ve mentioned the system because I’ve not liked certain things that I’ve seen, for instance Mason Mount playing left wingback. That can’t happen. Changing the back three all the time. Having two in midfield means that Bruno has to play in midfield. I don’t like that aspect of it.",
      "“So there are parts of the system that are a problem in the sense that they haven’t got the right players, or it’s meaning that Bruno’s not in his best position. The system does create problems, but he’s right in what he says, it’s not the entirety of the problem.",
      "\"The players are a problem. The manager is a problem. The whole thing is a problem if you’re losing football matches to the level that Manchester United have been doing then… I don’t know, I never blamed anybody else when we lost football matches.",
      "“I played in a dressing room that when you lost there was accountability. Why would you blame other people when you’re losing matches? That’s a pretty big problem itself. I’ve not got any time for it, excuse mentality, short cuts, blaming other people, it’s the worst thing you can do in life. I think they need to concentrate on doing their jobs, doing it well and winning matches, it’s the only thing that’s going to shut people up.”",
      "Goals from Mount and Benjamin Sesko gave them their third win from seven Premier League games on Saturday and moved United up to ninth place going into the international break.",

Hojlund departed United on deadline day following indications that his role as first-choice striker at Old Trafford faced uncertainty.",
      "Sesko arrived from RB Leipzig with the task of filling the Danish international's boots in the starting eleven. It was subsequently revealed that Hojlund remained receptive to departing Old Trafford should his playing opportunities diminish.",
      "Following his displacement by Sesko, the striker agreed to join Napoli on a temporary deal running until the campaign's conclusion. Prior to last weekend, Sesko had failed to find the net for the Reds since his switch from Germany.",
      "Nevertheless, he broke his duck with a close-range finish during the 3-1 reverse at Brentford. Fortunately for the Slovenian international, his second strike for the club proved far more celebratory as he extended the lead against Sunderland in a 2-0 triumph.",
      "Posting on Instagram following the result, Sesko shared his joy. \"What a feeling,\" he wrote.",
      "\"A goal at the Stretford End and three points to go with it. Let's build on this. Hungry for more!\"",
      "Hojlund might have been pardoned for harbouring resentment towards Sesko for scoring for United after taking his place in the squad. Instead, the Dane offered his support to the striker in the comments section.",
      "Reacting to the 22-year-old's achievement, Hojlund penned: \"Congratulations my friend.\" This sentiment was echoed by United skipper Bruno Fernandes who chimed in: \"Buzzing for you.\"",
      "Since his move to Napoli, Hojlund has netted three goals in five outings. His latest goals were scored midweek when he bagged a brace in the 2-1 triumph over Sporting in the Champions League.",

      "Many members of the United squad, including Sesko, will join their national teams for the next two weeks before regrouping at Carrington for the showdown against Liverpool in the Premier League later this month.

      "Sesko also elaborated on the emotions he felt after scoring his first Old Trafford goal for United. Despite the goal being a personal landmark for the striker, Sesko still pointed to the importance of the team getting all three points in a crucial Premier League fixture.",

      "Referees’ chief Howard Webb has reportedly admitted to Manchester United that they were the victims of a big mistake in their defeat by Brentford last weekend. United lost 3-1 in west London in a result which piled pressure onto Ruben Amorim, but the club felt hard done by.",
      "Bruno Fernandes saw his penalty saved by Caoimhin Kelleher after Nathan Collins' foul on Bryan Mbeumo offered them a route back into the game. Collins was bailed out by his goalkeeper and got lucky twice as he escaped a red card for pulling back the United forward inside the box.",
      "Referee Craig Pawson opted against the dismissal and his decision was upheld by VAR, with a statement released to explain the reasoning. “The referee’s call of penalty was checked and confirmed by VAR – with Collins deemed to have pulled Mbeumo back,” it read. “VAR also checked the referee’s call of yellow card to Collins – and deemed that Mbeumo wasn’t in control of the ball.”",
      "That decision was questioned by many and had an obvious impact on the game, with Brentford keeping 11 players on the pitch and going on to score again. United felt aggrieved and The Daily Mail says that they wrote to the Professional Game Match Officials for an explanation.",
      "United chief executive Omar Berrada and technical director Jason Wilcox got a response from PGMO chief Webb, who accepted that Pawson and the VAR had made a mistake and Collins should have seen red. It is not the first time that Webb has conceded a high-profile error this season and ex-Premier League referee Mark Halsey was stunned at this one.",
      "Halsey told the Sun: “The statement from the Match Centre said that Mbeumo did not have control of the ball. It doesn’t say in law about having the ball under control.",
      "\"It’s about the likelihood of keeping control of the ball. “In my opinion, the Match Centre statement was absolute nonsense and it was a clear, clear denial of a goalscoring opportunity.”",
      "Webb also came out this week to defend the decision to overturn Arsenal’s penalty against Newcastle when Viktor Gyokeres clashed with Nick Pope. “The VAR checks the penalty,” Webb explained on Premier League's Match Officials Mic'd Up show.",
      "\"When he does that, he clearly sees that Gyokeres gets to the ball, pokes it a little bit forward but then, importantly, Nick Pope also gets a very clear touch on the ball as he steps forward with that right foot and deviates the direction that the ball is going in. That hadn't been appreciated on the field by the referee.”",

      "Senne Lammens made a bright start to his Manchester United career this weekend, but as history shows, a strong debut doesn't always guarantee a permanent spot in the first team. This is a lesson that former United goalkeeper Dean Henderson learned the hard way.",
      "After a sparkling debut for the club in a League Cup match against Luton back in 2020, Henderson was tipped for big things. Many, including then-boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, saw him not only as United's future No. 1, but also England's. However, neither of these predictions came true.",
      "With David de Gea firmly cemented as first-choice keeper, Henderson found chances hard to come by. He later hinted that promises had been broken and admitted that his patience at Old Trafford \"wasted\" a significant part of his career.",
      "After joining United's academy in 2011, Henderson took his first steps into senior football on loan at Stockport County. His breakthrough, however, came at Sheffield United, where his standout performances in the club's 2019/20 Premier League campaign solidified his reputation as one of England's most promising talents.",
      "Interest in Henderson was high at the end of the season, but he chose to stay at United after reportedly being told he'd be the first choice in a year's time.",
      "Things initially started brightly. After making what Henderson described as a \"dream\" debut for the club, he went on to make 26 appearances in all competitions in 2020/21.",
      "\"I dreamt about this my whole life!\" Henderson wrote on social media after his first appearance in a United shirt. \"Unbelievable feeling to make my debut for the club I love! Clean sheet and a win to top it off!!!\"",
      "Yet when the 2021/22 campaign got underway, it became obvious that De Gea wasn't going anywhere and would retain his status as first choice - leaving Henderson understandably disappointed.",
      "\"To sit there and waste 12 months is criminal really, at my age. I was fuming,\" he told talkSPORT in 2022. \"I turned so many good loans down last summer for that reason [being promised No.1 spot], and they wouldn't let me go. It was frustrating.\"",
      "Henderson decided to take control of his own destiny, hastily arranging a temporary switch to Nottingham Forest ahead of new boss Erik ten Hag's summer 2022 arrival. \"I didn't really want the manager to come in and be able to see me in training because I knew he'd probably want to keep me,\" Henderson explained.",
      "\"So I tried to do it all before I left for the season, I told all the hierarchy I need to go and play football. I don't want to be here playing second fiddle. And it panned out so I was almost gone before the manager came in the door and I haven't spoken to him since.\"",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "At the City Ground, Henderson finally secured the regular minutes he'd been desperate for. However, an untimely thigh problem sidelined him for the second half of the campaign, disrupting the progress he'd at last begun to make.",
      "After a permanent switch to Crystal Palace in 2023, he initially shared goalkeeping duties with Sam Johnstone. However, by the 2024/25 campaign, Henderson had truly made his mark - securing his spot as Palace's top-choice goalkeeper.",
      "He ended the season on the highest of notes, saving a penalty in Palace's stunning 1-0 triumph over Manchester City in the FA Cup final. Now, he stands as a pivotal figure in the squad as the club embarks on its maiden European journey in the Conference League this season.",
      "United must be ruing their decision to let Henderson leave, at least to some degree. The man who was blocking his path, David de Gea, left the same summer he did, and De Gea's successor, Andre Onana, endured a torrid two-year spell between the sticks before being loaned out to Trabzonspor last month.",
      "In the weeks since, Altay Bayindir has been given the task of filling the void, with varying degrees of success. However, there is a glimmer of hope. Summer recruit Lammens made a promising impression during Saturday's 2-0 victory over Sunderland, pulling off a couple of key saves to secure United's first clean sheet of the season.",
      "The Belgian also stood out for his composure, both on the ball and when facing shots, and seems well on his way to establishing himself as United's No. 1. But as Henderson's cautionary tale has shown us, a positive start doesn't guarantee anything.",

      "And yet, instead of dwelling on the issue, Bayindir showed his maturity and celebrated with his teammate after he made a solid first appearance for United. This is exactly what the Reds need now more than ever.",
      "Yes, there has been a lack of quality at times under Amorim but team spirit has been clear for all to see. Fortunately, what we saw from Bayindir is a player who will not sulk and mope around the club because he has missed out on a start.",
      "It seems he's genuinely pleased for Lammens and his fellow players, as evidenced by his post-match social media activity. This surely contributes to a more positive vibe in the changing room.",
      "Naturally, you wouldn't want to lose that competitive drive and the will to fight for your place in the team. From Amorim's point of view, he'll be hopeful he sees this squad take inspiration from Bayindir and Lammens, striking the right balance between competitiveness and team unity.",

      "Wayne Rooney joked that Michael Owen was \"clearly\" a better footballer than he was at 17 in the most recent edition of Match of the Day. The Manchester United legend has been embroiled in a debate with the Liverpool icon as of late over who held more talent in their breakthrough year.",
      "The debate initially kicked off when Owen told the Rio Ferdinand podcast: \"I saw Wazza got asked who was the best out of us at the age of 17 or 18. And I did smile,\" before adding: \"The only person you could possibly compare me to in our country is Wayne Rooney.\"",
      "Rooney, meanwhile, responded to the striker's take by explaining: \"I think his comments are fair. Of course, he's going to back himself. I'd back myself.",
      "\"But, I'd never judge myself against Michael Owen because he's someone I actually looked up to and had the pleasure of playing alongside.\"",
      "After the nation fiercely debated who was the better player, it appears as though Rooney has now settled the argument once and for all. Speaking on Match of the Day on Saturday evening alongside Rooney and Alan Shearer, in the wake of Bukayo Saka achieving his 100th goal involvement during Arsenal's 2-0 win over West Ham, Gabby Logan pulled up a chart of the players who have achieved the same feat as well as how many games it took them to do so.",
      "The presenter added: \"You’re just behind Michael Owen, he’s top of the pops there, for players with 100 Premier League goal involvements and how few games they’ve got there - 153 for Michael, 187 for you, 212 for Bukayo.\"",
      "To which, Rooney replied: \"Yeah, I think that clearly shows that Michael was a better player than I was at that age,\" before erupting with laughter. He then added: \"But no, I think for Saka, he’s such an important player for Arsenal and for England.",
      "\"I think over the last three or four years, he’s probably been Arsenal’s most important player. He’s had a few injuries which have affected…them numbers would even better if that weren’t the case I believe. But yeah, he’s such an incredible player.\"",
      "Declan Rice opened the scoring against his old club on Saturday afternoon with a well-placed strike past Alphonse Areola into the top left corner with 38 minutes played. Saka then doubled Arsenal's lead in the second-half, coolly converting from the spot after Jurrien Timber was brought down in the West Ham box.",
      "Both Rooney and Owen enjoyed incredible playing careers in the Premier League. Rooney currently sits third in the Premier League's tally of all-time top scorers with 208 goals to his name with Everton and Manchester United, with Shearer and Harry Kane ahead of him with 260 and 213 respectively.",
      "Owen, meanwhile, failed to make it into the top 10, with 150 goals across his incredible career with Liverpool, Newcastle United, Manchester United, and Stoke City.",

      "Marcus Rashford is rapidly closing in on a personal milestone he set himself for his loan stint at Barcelona. The England winger secured his switch to Spain from Manchester United over the summer after finding himself frozen out by Ruben Amorim's plans.",
      "Raphinha and Lamine Yamal predictably limited Rashford to brief substitute appearances during his opening weeks at the Catalan giants. But fitness problems have elevated him to a key role under Hansi Flick - and he's seized that opportunity.",
      "Rashford has delivered a goal contribution in five of his previous six outings across all competitions, including an assist before his spectacular double against Newcastle United in the Champions League. Making his return to St James' Park, Rashford nodded Barcelona ahead before unleashing a sensational long-range effort.",
      "He has since provided assists in his subsequent three appearances, serving as a stark reminder to United of his capabilities.",
      "His most recent came earlier this week versus Paris Saint-Germain - a sublime first-time delivery to Ferran Torres.",
      "With Barcelona hunting a decisive goal following Senny Mayulu's leveller, Rashford was withdrawn as Flick justified his substitution.",
      "\"I think you could see in the second half that some players were very tired. Marcus, Pedri, [Frenkie] De Jong,\" he told Diario AS.",
      "\"They gave their all on the pitch. At 1-1, you have to defend better. You have to learn and improve against teams of this quality.\"",
      "Despite the looming threat of injury, Rashford's stellar performances have earned him a spot in Thomas Tuchel's England squad for the forthcoming October international fixtures.",
      "He netted a goal in the 5-0 World Cup qualifying victory over Serbia last month, but it appears that's not his primary focus. As per Spanish daily Mundo Deportivo, Rashford is setting his sights on racking up between 30 to 40 assists this season.",
      "From his initial nine competitive outings for the Catalan giants, Rashford has already chalked up four assists and with approximately 40 matches still to play, he'll need to step up his game. Given he's playing alongside the likes of Raphinha, Yamal, Torres and Robert Lewandowski, it's hardly surprising he's set such an ambitious goal.",

      "Senne Lammens kicked off his Manchester United career with a victory and a clean sheet, earning widespread praise from Belgian media outlets back home. Lammens made the switch to United from Royal Antwerp on transfer deadline day but had to bide his time for his debut whilst Ruben Amorim persisted with Altay Bayindir between the sticks.",
      "The young goalkeeper finally got his chance on Saturday, with Amorim giving him the nod against Sunderland. Everything went to plan for the 23-year-old, as strikes from Mason Mount and Benjamin Sesko secured United all three points and lifted some heat off their under-pressure boss.",
      "United's triumph came at a crucial moment for Amorim, amid whispers that his position could be under threat following a defeat. Following the result, he heaped praise on Lammens whilst also commending the squad's collective effort.",
      "\"We didn't play well all the game, but we had our moments and we defended well,\" Amorim said. \"I think Senne did a great job and gave us confidence. It was a good day, not a perfect day, but to win like this with a clean sheet is important for our team.",
      "\"We need to understand that we need everyone to be ready to play. It's a long season, we have a lot of problems, anything can happen. The important thing is that the teammates helped Lammens a lot to have a very good performance.\"",
      "Whilst Lammens will undoubtedly encounter stiffer challenges than Sunderland this campaign, potentially beginning with his next outing, he still garnered acclaim from the Belgian press. Here's a selection of their comments.",
      "\"Against Sunderland, the scenario was perfect for Lammens,\" Sporza's verdict began. \"He was barely challenged in the first half and took no risks in possession. It was striking how he constantly connected with his backline and made adjustments. Sober, precise and controlling. Old Trafford appreciated this and gave Lammens plenty of opportunities at times.\"",
      "The same publication highlighted his brilliant stop from a long-range Granit Xhaka strike, plus the fortunate moment when Bertrand Traore was cautioned for simulation after it briefly appeared Lammens might have given away a penalty kick. \"If Ruben Amorim still had any doubts about who would be the first choice goalkeeper, Lammens has more than left his mark today,\" Sporza added.",
      "Another Belgian outlet, HLN, emphasised Amorim's commendation of Lammens whilst noting the shot-stopper observed much of the opening period 'from a distance'. They wrote: \"Just over a month after his arrival and after three matches on the bench, Lammens finally made his debut for Manchester United.",
      "\"The goalkeeper thus became the seventh Belgian to feature for the Red Devils. Marouane Fellaini, Romelu Lukaku, Adnan Januzaj, Ritchie De Laet, Marnick Vermijl and Largie Ramazani preceded him.",
      "\"Lammens had to prove himself once in the first half. The former Antwerp goalkeeper made a good save on a powerful shot from Xhaka. His play on the ball at his feet and on high balls was also flawless. From a distance, our compatriot saw Manchester United dominate.\"",
      "The report went on to suggest his upcoming fixture might prove far more challenging. \"All in all, Lammens can look back with satisfaction on his debut in the Manchester United shirt,\" it continued.",
      "\"His first clean sheet is a fact. This debut will leave him wanting more. His next assignment? The top-flight match at Anfield against Liverpool on Sunday, October 19th. Lammens will likely be tested more then.\"",
      "Nieuwsblad's Brian Dewulf highlighted United supporters' reaction to the outstanding debut. \"Just before half-time, Senne Lammens finally got the chance to show his true colours,\" he wrote.",
      "\"Granit Xhaka had the first attempt for Sunderland, but Lammens saw the long-range shot come from far out and made a good save. There was applause in Old Trafford. The Belgian goalkeeper remained virtually unemployed in the second half, though it was a bit of a shock after an hour of play. Bruno Fernandes gave his keeper the runaround with a long ball, causing the pair to collide. Sunderland winger Traoré lurked and nearly capitalised, but also went down in the action.",
      "\"Ultimately, Man United were given the foul, allowing Lammens and his teammates to breathe a sigh of relief. He was applauded again in the final seconds for his second save of the evening, but Lammens was never given another opportunity.",
      "\"It was certainly a successful debut for the Belgian goalkeeper. Manchester United secured only their third Premier League victory and the young Belgian also secured their first clean sheet of the season for the Mancunians.",
      "\"Has the train departed? During the match, the home fans were already singing loudly for the goalkeeper: \"Are you Schmeichel in disguise?\" fans wondered aloud if Lammens wasn't just the former Danish legend of Man U.\"",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Manchester United have been warned off trying to sign Frenkie de Jong by a former Barcelona coach. The Red Devils have been linked with the Dutch midfielder since Erik ten Hag pinpointed him as a priority target following his arrival in 2022.",
      "The former United manager was eager to reunite with his former player after their successful spell together at Ajax, with reports suggesting Barcelona were willing to offload the star. However, with De Jong determined to stay in Spain, he turned down United.",
      "Three years on, De Jong is approaching the end of his Barca contract, meaning, as it stands, he will be a free agent next summer unless the Catalans try and recoup a transfer fee in January.",
      "Therefore, he could soon come back onto United's radar if Ruben Amorim, or whoever is in charge, decides he would bolster the team's midfield. However, Oscar Garcia, a former Barca youth coach, has advised against signing De Jong.",
      "He argued that while De Jong is a talented player, he doesn't justify his wages. Speaking on Cadena SER's Què t'hi Jugues show during Barcelona's 3-1 victory at Real Oviedo on Thursday, Garcia said: \"I think he's better than you say and worse than what he's paid to do.",
      "\"He's a good player, but he's not the typical footballer we've always had in that position in front of the defence. And he's not decisive enough to be one of the highest-paid.",
      "\"Normally, the highest paid are the ones who decide games. Yes, he's a very good player, but I don't think he can decide a match.\"",
      "De Jong is one of the top earners in the squad, with only Robert Lewandowski earning a higher salary. According to SPORT, Barcelona president Joan Laporta wants to maintain the terms of De Jong's current contract if he stays at the club.",
      "Despite Garcia's criticism, De Jong has made a good start to the season, with seven appearances across La Liga and the Champions League. Barca are currently second in La Liga, two points behind Real Madrid but with a game in hand.",
      "United were linked with a host of top-class midfielders in the summer but failed to add to their ranks in that position. If Amorim is still at the helm come January, he will surely be looking to strengthen that area of the pitch.",
      "The Portuguese coach bought himself some more time on Saturday by leading United to a much-needed 2-0 victory over Sunderland at Old Trafford.",

      "And Maguire has become a target of Saudi sides Al-Nassr and Al-Ettifaq. He is free to open talks with clubs when January 1 hits and would be able to command huge wages if he decided to head to the Middle East and join the Pro-League.",

      "Ruben Amorim's Manchester United squad stepped up to the plate, saving their manager from another uncomfortable post-match inquest and, potentially, even losing his job.",
      "Ahead of the match, Amorim confessed that if results didn't pick up, it would be impossible for him to continue, with this game being touted as a do-or-die situation for the beleaguered United boss. However, first-half goals from Mason Mount and £74million summer recruit Benjamin Sesko paved the way for a comfortable United victory, propelling them to eighth place in the Premier League standings.",
      "Amorim will now hope to see out the international break without the fear of receiving a call from chief executive Omar Berrada thanking him for his services.",
      "This win was crucial for Amorim to alleviate the mounting pressure on him, amid rumours of players losing confidence in his tactics and the United board beginning to question his suitability. United are still a team under construction and have yet to secure consecutive league victories under Amorim, but this win – even against a lacklustre Sunderland side – has bought the head coach some time.",
      "Amorim made five changes from the team that suffered a 3-1 defeat at Brentford a week ago, giving goalkeeper Senne Lammens his United debut, while Altay Bayindir was relegated to the bench. The United boss had previously stated that the two would compete for the No. 1 spot, and Lammens' performance suggests that Bayindir will struggle to reclaim his position.",
      "Lammens dominated his area, earning a massive cheer in the first half when he confidently collected the ball, and made two impressive saves in each half to round off an excellent debut. Bayindir has struggled to impress early in the season, so it was a breath of fresh air to see some stability brought to the defence.",
      "Sunderland rocked up at Old Trafford following their best start to a top-flight season in 70 years, having racked up 11 points to kick off the game in sixth place in the league table.",
      "Given this context, Amorim and his squad anticipated a tough challenge from Regis Le Bris's team, but the newly-promoted side failed to deliver. United got off to a dream start, taking the lead after just eight minutes, with Bryan Mbeumo setting up Mason Mount, who controlled the ball with his left foot before clinically finishing with his right from just inside the 18-yard box.",
      "Amad nearly doubled the lead in the 20th minute, cutting in from the left into the penalty area, then firing a left-footed shot towards goal which Sunderland 'keeper Robin Roefs did well to deflect.",
      "Roefs had to be on his toes again a few minutes later to fend off a shot from Mbeumo, as United ramped up the pressure in pursuit of a second goal to give them a bit more breathing room. United captain Bruno Fernandes then saw a delightful chip tipped onto the bar by Roefs, as the hosts bombarded the goalmouth at the Stretford End.",
      "The second goal arrived in the 31st minute, with Benjamin Sesko pouncing on a loose ball and slotting it into the net after Diogo Dalot's long throw-in was flicked on by Sunderland's Nordi Mukiele. It marked Sesko's second goal for United, following his strike in last weekend's defeat at Brentford, and was no more than Amorim's side deserved.",
      "Sunderland struggled to pose an attacking threat, but when they did, Lammens was there to thwart them, diving early to his left to save a low shot from Black Cats captain Granit Xhaka.",
      "United had a scare just before half-time when referee Stuart Attwell awarded a penalty following a high challenge from Sesko on Sunderland's Trai Hume. However, after a VAR review and a check on the pitchside monitor, Attwell reversed his decision.",
      "In the end, United's first-half performance was enough to secure the win, setting them up nicely for a massive test after the international break – a trip to reigning champions and fierce rivals Liverpool.",

      "It'll be tough to dislodge him.",
      "Leny Yoro - 7",
      "The Frenchman deserved his return to the starting line-up after being benched for the previous two matches. He brings a better balance to United's back three.",
      "Matthijs de Ligt - 7",
      "He was constantly alert to danger and never found himself out of position while defending his goal. He played a crucial role in United's second goal, challenging for the flick-on that ultimately led to it.",
      "Luke Shaw - 7",
      "He retained his spot on the left side of United's back three, but moved inside to a more central position at times after the interval, giving United greater control on the ball.",
      "Amad - 7",
      "He was a constant menace down the right flank. He tormented Sunderland's defence and was unlucky not to score in the first half when he cut inside and saw a goal-bound effort saved.",
      "Casemiro - 7",
      "Back in the starting line-up following his one-match ban, he was disciplined in midfield, although he picked up an obligatory booking late on for a poor challenge.",
      "Bruno Fernandes - 7",
      "The United captain put in a spirited performance, covering an impressive amount of ground and nearly scoring with a sublime chip that was tipped onto the bar by Robin Roefs.",
      "Diogo Dalot - 7",
      "Despite the Brentford mishap, Dalot retained his spot and it was from his long throw-in that Sesko managed to bag United's second goal. His energy levels were commendable.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo - 7",
      "Mbeumo was a constant thorn in Sunderland's side, providing the assist for Mount's opening goal and consistently making dangerous runs behind the defence.",
      "Benjamin Sesko - 7",
      "Sesko found the back of the net for the second consecutive game with a classic poacher's goal from close range in the first half. His aerial threat was utilised effectively by United throughout the match.",
      "Mason Mount - 8",
      "Returning to the starting line-up, Mount justified his selection by setting United on the path to victory with a brilliantly executed goal. He received a standing ovation when he was substituted.",
      "Subs:.",
      "Dorgu (for Dalot, 64) 6 - Solid performance at left wing-back.",
      "Cunha (for Mount, 64) 6 - Provided a lively attacking threat",
      "Mainoo (for Mbeumo, 76) 6 - Didn't have enough time to make an impact on the game.",
      "Ugarte (for Casemiro, 85) N/A - Came on late in the game.",
      "Maguire (for Yoro, 85). N/A - Helped secure the win.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Manchester United fans serenaded new goalkeeper Senne Lammens after his winning debut for the Red Devils. Lammens, 23, made his long-awaited first start for United in Saturday's comfortable 2-0 win at home to Sunderland.",
      "The Belgian joined Ruben Amorim's team from Royal Antwerp for an initial £18.2million on transfer deadline day. Altay Bayindir kept his place for the next three Premier League games, but after the Turkey international struggled in last weekend's 3-1 loss against Brentford, Amorim made a change.",
      "Lammens repaid his faith with an assured performance, making a diving save to deny Granit Xhaka a goal from distance in the first half before denying Chemsdine Talbi with his legs late on. Responding to the 23-year-old's stop, the Stretford End chanted: \"Are you Schmeichel in disguise?\", referencing their legendary former goalkeeper, Peter.",
      "Amorim will be delighted with Lammens' performance and the result, which eases pressure on his position during the forthcoming international break. It was billed as a must-win game for the Red Devils boss, with speculation that United were looking at options to replace him after a wretched 11 months in charge and woeful start to the new season.",
      "Ahead of Sunderland's visit, his side had lost four of their opening seven games. First-half goals from Mason Mount and Benjamin Sesko were the perfect tonic, as was a Sunderland penalty which was overturned following a VAR review.",
      "\"That is the kind of game where when we're not playing well we're defending well,\" Amorim told BBC Sport after giving the perfect reply to his doubters. \"We had our moments, we were focussed and competitive. Not the perfect performance.",
      "\"Senne did really well. We were a competitive and adult team today. We need to win these games with a clean sheet. Good for us.\"",
      "Mount also discussed Lammens' debut, saying: \"It's important in the Premier League keeping clean sheets, you have chances to score and then to keep the clean sheet in the second half was so important.",
      "\"He was solid, when we were under pressure, the option was Ben [Sesko] and we worked off that. Buzzing for him, everyone was around him today, it can be tough making your first start we wat to be together and I felt that today so we keep moving forward.\"",

      "Things finally clicked into gear for Manchester United on a pivotal afternoon for Ruben Amorim, who will be able to enjoy some respite during the international break following a comfortable 2-0 win over Sunderland.",
      "The pressure and scrutiny has grown on Amorim in recent weeks due to United's poor form and it was imperative United signed off for the international break with a positive result. Step forward Mason Mount, who gave United the perfect platform to do just that with a crisp finish in the eighth minute after he was picked out expertly by Bryan Mbeumo in the penalty area.",
      "The hosts kept pushing with Robin Roefs in the away goal keeping the score down, thwarting Amad, Mbeumo and Bruno Fernandes. But he was helpless on the half hour mark when Benjamin Sesko tucked home a first time finish in the six-yard box to give United some breathing space.",
      "It may only be the first weekend in October, but this game felt like must-win territory for Amorim and United. And for all the criticism that has been levelled at the Portuguese coach and his team in recent weeks, they delivered here.",
      "United were far more fluent and looked how you would expect Man United to look playing at home to Sunderland, with all due respect to the visitors. Amad was super effective getting forward at right wing-back and Bruno Fernandes, though playing in a deeper role again, was heavily involved in advanced positions and only denied a goal by an exceptional save from Roefs.",
      "On an afternoon where something had to give, United stepped up. They could - and maybe should - have got more goals, but this result could yet kickstart for their season.",
      "After weeks of talk over the goalkeeper situation, Amorim decided today was the day for Lammens, an £18.2million deadline day signing, to make his bow. And thankfully for United, their new man didn't disappoint on his maiden outing between the sticks.",
      "United are in desperate need of a strong figure in goal with neither Altay Bayindir or Andre Onana convincing during Amorim's tenure. Lammens was assured here and didn't put a foot wrong in difficult conditions.",
      "If Lammens is to be United's No 1 long-term, then he did his chances no harm with this display, which saw him keep the team's first clean sheet of the season.",
      "United spent £200million to address their goalscoring problem in the summer and there are now signs that the tide could be turning. Sesko, the club's marquee signing, has now scored in consecutive Premier League games, while Mbeumo grabbed the assist for United's first.",
      "Some of United's attacking play was slick. Mbeumo's fizzed pass into Mount was a thing of beauty and the former Chelsea midfielder's finish did it justice, while Sesko grew into the game and seems to be finding his feet at Old Trafford.",
      "It's still early days but United's new signings will be scrutinised when it comes to returns given the club's outlay. But as long as the goals and assists keep coming, like they did here for Sesko and Mbeumo, then there will be few grumbles.",
      "While all the talk before the game was of Lammens, it was Roefs who stole the show in the first half with a string of fine saves to keep the score down, particularly one world-class save to tip an effort from Fernandes onto the post in the first half.",
      "Sunderland have made a fine start to life back among England's elite but struggled to trouble a United side who finally showed some promise to ease the pressure on their beleaguered head coach.",
      "Make no mistake, today was huge for Amorim. Was his job on the line, as some have suggested? We'll never know given United have won, but it certainly felt must-win. And give credit where credit is due, he got his big calls right here.",
      "The decision to give Lammens the nod in goal was a shrewd one and United looked comfortable defensively. Much has been made of Amorim's 3-4-3 system - and his refusal to deviate from it - but key players such as Amad and Fernandes were effective here as United clinched a much-needed win. United's new-look attack recorded more returns, too, if you're looking for another positive.",
      "This will give him some welcome breathing space during the international break. But as positive as this afternoon was, it will count for little if United don't kick on after the break.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Sunderland were denied a penalty in controversial circumstances against Manchester United. Benjamin Sesko's high foot came close to Trai Hume's head but did not appear to connect, which saw the initial penalty decision overturned.",
      "There was confusion as Stuart Attwell pointed to the spot amid appeals from the visitors at Old Trafford. The official required some consultation with his linesman before initially awarding an opportunity from 12 yards.",
      "VAR then intervened to assess the incident and ultimately sent Attwell to rewatch the play. It transpired that the ball connected with Hume's face while Sesko did not make contact in the incident, other than perhaps grazing his opponent's shoulder.",
      "Once again, the pace of the decision-making proved infuriating for players and fans alike, as Bruno Fernandes appeared to indicate that it was not a penalty before the official.",
      "The Premier League Match Centre confirmed the process. \"After VAR review, the referee overturned the original decision of penalty to Sunderland.",
      "Referee announcement: “After review, there is no foul by the Manchester United player. He does not make contact with the head of the attacker. As the ball is out of play when the decision was made, the final decision is corner kick.”",
      "Dean said on Soccer Saturday: \"The issue I have, we have referees as VARs and assistant referees as assistant VARs.",
      "\"For some reason today, we've got an assistant referee as VAR and an assistant VAR. So they don't really know what's happened.",
      "\"For me, there's no contact whatsoever. He shouldn't have been sent to the screen, it should have been cleared on the field.\"",
      "It appears, Dean had been caught up in the confusion himself, and had not realised that Attwell's first decision needed to be overturned. The former-ref later clarified: \"The pictures me and Tim [Sherwood] were seeing, unfortunately, looked like it wasn’t given on field and was sent to VAR, I did a bit of digging at half-time and the referee actually gave the decision on field, so for me, he’s got that wrong.",
      "\"I had a bit of a go at Neil Davies, the VAR, saying he shouldn’t have got involved, but he was right to get involved as it was the wrong call by the referee. Neil got it right, sent him to the screen, it was overturned and the correct decision was made.\"",
      "The decision threatened to dampen what had been an exciting opening 45 minutes for Ruben Amorim's side. Mason Mount opened the scoring after just eight minutes as United started on the front foot against their in-form opposition.",
      "Sesko then doubled his side's advantage just after the half-hour mark as the Red Devils looked to get back to winning ways following defeat to Brentford seven days ago. United saw out the second period to earn a 2-0 win.",

      "Jamie Redknapp has suggested that Manchester United target Andoni Iraola could manage 'any club in the world'. The Red Devils are pondering a managerial shake-up following their dismal start to the season.",
      "Current boss Ruben Amorim is feeling the heat, and a change could be imminent if United's dreadful form persists. A host of managers have been linked with the Old Trafford hot seat, including Bournemouth's Iraola.",
      "The Basque coach has made waves during his stint on the South Coast, with Friday night's victory over Fulham propelling the Cherries into the Champions League spots. Redknapp has been so taken aback by Iraola's performance that he believes he would be a boon to any club, including United.",
      "\"He's got so much quality, he improves players, he gives young players opportunities, the system is great, everything you do is very progressive, it's exciting, it's on the front foot.",
      "\"I would say he's one of the best managers in world football right now. They've just got to enjoy him while he's here. How long? Who knows... amazing manager at such a small club.\"",
      "Fellow pundit Steve Sidwell was in full agreement, stating that players would jump at the opportunity to play under the Spanish coach. He elaborated: \"He simplifies the game. As a footballer, when you go out onto the pitch, you just want two or three instructions, don't overcomplicate, I think that's what he does.",
      "\"If you look at the way Bournemouth play, high intensity, win the ball as high up the pitch as we can. They go direct; they know how to turn teams and play to their strengths.",
      "\"They've got the players around there that will do that. No egos, know their jobs, know their roles. It looks like everyone is enjoying themselves. I'd love to have played under him.\"",
      "Iraola took the reins at Bournemouth back in 2023 after previous manager Gary O'Neil was given his marching orders. In his first season, he guided the club to a respectable 12th place finish, improving to ninth in the subsequent campaign.",
      "The Cherries underwent a significant revamp in the summer, with key players such as Milos Kerkez, Ilya Zabarnyi, Dean Huijsen and Dango Outtara all being shown the door during the transfer window. However, this hasn't slowed down Bournemouth's momentum, who have managed to secure four victories from their first seven league matches of the season.",
      "Last summer, Iraola put pen to paper on a new two-year contract with the club, although discussions regarding a contract extension are expected.",

      "It took just eight minutes for Mount to vindicate his selection and the standing ovation for the midfielder when he was substituted spoke volumes. It was probably his best performance for United.",

      "\"Bruno spoke about before the game, before kick-off in the huddle. So I felt that, I felt the energy at the beginning of the game and obviously to get the goal, I think really settled us.",
      "\"And then to go on and get another goal, going into half-time 2-0 up, you're in a good place. I don't think we stepped off at all in the second half, it was kept a bit cagey, but it was massive to get a clean sheet as well. So yeah, a very important win for us.\"",
      "Mount continued: \"I think it was massive to really start sharp today. Big character to step up after a difficult game and we did that. Now we've got to push on, we obviously have a bit of a break now before the next game, but we need to take positives from this game and take them into the next one.\"",
      "Amorim has admitted he \"loves\" Mount. \"I see myself as bringing a lot of energy into the team and setting off the press at times, being a bit of a catalyst going forward,\" he reflected.",
      "\"So, yeah, that's always something that I focus on, helping the people around me and really bringing the energy. And to get the goal was obviously massive for me, getting the first goal of the season at home in the Premier League. Important. So, yeah, I really enjoyed that.\"",
      "Mount rounded off an 18-pass sequence - the most passes United have made before a league goal for two years - in the style akin to previous holders of the number seven shirt.",
      "There were green shoots after United's setback against Brentford last weekend. Amorim spoke about negative press potentially affecting the dressing room before Sunderland, but Mount insisted the players are focused on delivering what the manager wants to see on the pitch.",
      "When asked if external noise permeates the dressing room, Mount said: \"No. For us, it's just focusing on what the manager wants and that's in training. And then when it comes to the games, doing exactly what he asked for. And I think, as you see today, we stuck to the job in hand.",
      "\"Everyone did their roles and responsibilities and it was a good performance. I think in the second half it got a bit cagey and there were times where we had to defend. We had to put the body on the line.\"",
      "Mount praised the contributions of Senne Lammens and Benjamin Sesko, while reiterating that the squad is fighting together and behind the manager to 'continue moving forward'.",
      "He said: \"The defenders were amazing. So that was really important for everyone. I mean, for Ben [Sesko], scoring his goal was so important. I'm absolutely over the moon for him.",
      "\"And obviously, Senne [Lammens] coming in as well. It was a solid performance. Any danger of them pressing, he puts it into Ben and we work off that. I think he kind of released the pressure a lot today.",
      "\"And everyone was around him. Altay [Bayindir] was around him. Tom [Heaton] was around him before the game. And that shows the togetherness we have.",
      "\"Obviously, even in this season, we've gone through ups and downs, but we're together. And we'll continue to be together with the manager, with the staff, to continue moving forward.\"",
      "Speaking about his relationship with Amorim, Mount added: \"I have a good relationship with the manager. I don't think it's any better than all the other lads. I think I have the experience of playing a similar formation to what he likes. As I have played it before in the past.",
      "\"So, knowing the roles and what he wants out of the team resonates with me because I've done it before. So, I think that's something that I obviously understand.",
      "\"I think all the players understand it now. But I think at the beginning, especially, it was something that maybe he could lean on me because I know the positions.\"",
      "Mount admitted United's players were hurt after losing against Brentford. \"It's difficult sometimes when you only have one game a week because there's a lot of time to think,\" he said.",
      "\"After a game like Brentford, we're hurt. As a team, as a staff, because we know we can do better. It really hurts us, obviously, as a club as well. It feels like a long time until the next game.",
      "\"But when that game does come around, you're prepared. You're ready to really start sharp, as I said before. That was our goal from the beginning. Because we know if we start sharp and we're on the front foot, especially at home, then it can definitely go our way.\"",

      "Manchester United won 2-0 against Sunderland in the Premier League on Saturday afternoon.",
      "United made the perfect start to the game when taking an early lead through Mason Mount, and Benjamin Sesko extended the advantage as United led by two heading into the interval.",
      "Ruben Amorim needed a positive result after losing against Brentford last weekend, and there were huge cheers at the final whistle as United moved into the top half of the Premier League.",
      "Here are the talking points and moments you might have missed at Old Trafford:",
      "Lammens sparkles on his debut",
      "Lammens finally made his debut after his deadline day signing from Royal Antwerp. Fans had wondered when Lammens would be given his first start, and it felt sensible to play him against Sunderland.",
      "The bar is low for Lammens to impress at United, given that supporters have watched error-prone goalkeepers Andre Onana and Altay Bayindir underperform over the last few seasons.",
      "That was highlighted when Lammens made a good save to deny a powerful shot from Granit Xhaka near the end of the first half. It was a decent save from Lammens - but a stop any goalkeeper worth their salt should make - and it was met by huge applause from each corner of the ground.",
      "Then Lammens came to claim a cross into the box with authority just minutes later - and the reaction from the crowd was so loud you would have thought they were celebrating a goal.",
      "Matthijs de Ligt sprinted to Lammens to congratulate him after the final whistle. Lammens also received a hug from Harry Maguire and a high five from Luke Shaw.",
      "Mount's first pump to the crowd",
      "Amorim made five changes to his starting XI to face Sunderland and Mount was selected to start over Matheus Cunha, a decision which was vindicated just eight minutes into the contest.",
      "Mbeumo picked out Mount in the box, but he still had plenty to do. Mount brought the ball down with his left foot and the touch was slightly heavy, although that didn't stop him from finishing intelligently.",
      "Amorim reacted on the touchline by calmly giving a simple thumbs up to his coaching staff, however, Mount's celebration in front of the Stretford End was a tad more enthusiastic.",
      "Mount roared to the terraces and passionately fist-pumped as his teammates prepared for the restart. You can tell the 26-year-old genuinely cares when he plays, and that goes a long way in the modern game.",
      "The towel worked a treat",
      "Amorim wore a full tracksuit against Sunderland and United scored a goal that Tony Pulis, who famously wore a full tracksuit during his managerial days in the Premier League, would have been proud of.",
      "Dalot launched a long throw into the box for Sesko's goal to make it 2-0. The Slovenia international reacted well to the flick-on to score his second goal for United in a week.",
      "Before taking the throw-in, Dalot dried the ball with a towel to improve his grip, which worked a treat. Arsenal have enjoyed success with Mikel Arteta in charge by making the most of the 'dark arts' and the introduction of towels around the side of the pitch was a no-brainer for United.",
      "Following Sesko's goal, Dalot created another opportunity with a long throw-in and he benefited from the towel again. United must do everything they can to give themselves the best chance of winning.",
      "Amorim learned from Chelsea",
      "It was disappointing to see Casemiro receive a second yellow card against Chelsea, as United were cruising into half-time before he foolishly made a cynical foul, which meant both sides had 10 men for the second half.",
      "However, Amorim learned from that episode by substituting Casemiro off against Sunderland just minutes after he had received a yellow card for bringing Brian Brobbey to the ground.",
      "Amorim could not take any risks with five minutes remaining and introduced Manuel Ugarte.",
      "No banner, no problem",
      "Amorim emerged from the tunnel for kick-off shortly after his players had walked out from the dressing room. And there wasn't much applause for Amorim from the Stretford End.",
      "It was also interesting that \"the good days are coming\" banner could not be spotted among the banners and flags that were unfurled. That banner was seen in the Stretford End before the Burnley game last month, but it appeared to be left at home after a bad result against Brentford last weekend.",
      "Amorim did receive some applause from fans in the Sir Bobby Charlton Stand, though.",
      "Matchgoing fans have continued to back Amorim, despite him failing to give them a reason to, but the muted reception for his emergence from the tunnel suggested a few have started to change their minds.",
      "Amorim desperately needed a win and will be relieved to have secured three points. His name was chanted loudly in the final seconds of the game - Amorim just needs to continue to win games.",

      "The Slovenia international reacted quickly to poke home at the Stretford End in the 31st minute, which extended United's advantage following an opening goal from Mason Mount.",
      "Sesko celebrated by leaping into the air and he was clearly delighted during his post-match interview with MUTV. \"It feels amazing,\" he said. \"It feels even better because I helped the team win the game. Because in the end, it's important to win the match. I try to help the team as much as possible.",

      "Speaking about the difference between the Premier League and Bundesliga, Sesko said: \"I would say it's way quicker and you have less time in general. This is one of the biggest changes, I would say. Everyone is really physical and athletic, but I'm getting used to it. I'll come to this level soon.",
      "\"To play for a club like this, even train every day, is an obvious pleasure and I'm looking forward to being back [after the international break].\"",

      "First-half goals from Mason Mount and Benjamin Sesko were enough to earn United three points that move them up six places to eighth in the Premier League going into the international break.",
      "Here is how United's players rated this afternoon:",
      "Senne Lammens",
      "An assured United debut from the deadline day signing. Confident coming for the ball and made a fine save from Granit Xhaka and one near the end. Will be hard to dislodge him. 8",
      "Leny Yoro",
      "Disciplined in his defending and deserving of his recall to the starting line-up after being benched for the previous two games . Brings better balance to United's back three. 7",
      "Matthijs de Ligt",
      "Alert to danger throughout and never caught out of position defending his goal. Played a key role in United's second goal, challenging for the flick-on that ultimately led to it. 7",
      "Luke Shaw",
      "Kept his place on the left side of United's back three, but moved inside to a more central position at times after the break, giving United greater control on the ball. 7",
      "Amad",
      "A constant threat down the right side. Tormented Sunderland's defence and unlucky not to score in the first-half when he cut inside and saw a goal-bound effort saved. 7",
      "Casemiro",
      "Back in the starting line-up following his one-match ban, he was disciplined in midfield, although he picked up an obligatory booking late on for a poor challenge. 7",
      "Bruno Fernandes",
      "Another ebullient performance from the United skipper, who was seemingly everywhere, covering so much ground. Had an exquisite chip tipped onto the bar by Robin Roefs. 7",
      "Diogo Dalot",
      "Kept his place following the Brentford debacle and it was from his long throw-in that Sesko was able to plunder United's second goal. Impressive energy levels. 7",
      "Bryan Mbeumo",
      "Provided the assist for Mount's opener and never gave the Sunderland defence any peace with his runs in behind and ability to pick up dangerous positions. 7",
      "Benjamin Sesko",
      "Scored for the second game running with a classic poacher's goal from close-range in the first-half. United exploited his aerial threat throughout to win second balls. 7",
      "Mason Mount",
      "Restored to the starting line-up and justified his selection by setting United on their way to victory with a superbly-taken goal. Standing ovation when taken off. 8",
      "Subs:",
      "Dorgu (Dalot, 64)",
      "Solid at left wing-back. 6",
      "Cunha (Mount, 64)",
      "Lively attacking threat. 6",
      "Mainoo (Mbeumo, 76)",
      "Not enough time to impact the game. 6",

      "Ruben Amorim's Manchester United players delivered for their boss to spare him another uneasy inquest and potentially the sack.",
      "Amorim admitted ahead of the game that it would be impossible for him to carry on if results did not improve – with this game billed as make-or-break for the embattled United boss.",
      "Amorim will hope he can now head into the international break without worrying about getting a call from chief executive Omar Berrada thanking him for his time in charge.",
      "Amorim needed this victory to ease the growing pressure on him, amid suggestions of players losing faith in his methods and United's hierarchy starting to harbour doubts about him.",
      "United remain a work in progress and have yet to win back-to-back league games under Amorim, but this win – albeit against a meek Sunderland side – has bought the head coach more time.",
      "Amorim made five changes from the side that lost 3-1 at Brentford a week earlier, handing goalkeeper Senne Lammens his United debut, with Altay Bayindir demoted to the bench.",
      "The United boss had already declared the pair would fight it out for the No.1 spot and the way Lammens performed suggests it will be hard for Bayindir to win back his place.",
      "Lammens commanded his area, earned a huge first-half cheer when he came for the ball and confidently collected it, and produced two fine saves in either half to cap a solid first game. Bayindir has failed to convince in the early parts of the season and it was refreshing to see some stability brought to the backline.",
      "Sunderland arrived at Old Trafford on the back of their best start to a top-flight season for 70 years, having amassed 11 points to start the game in sixth position in the table.",
      "Against that backdrop, Amorim and his players expected Regis Le Bris's side to provide a stern test, but it was anything but that as their newly-promoted opponents failed to show up.",
      "United made the perfect start, taking the lead after eight minutes, Bryan Mbeumo picking out Mason Mount, who took the ball down with his left foot before producing a clinical finish with his right to score from just inside the 18-yard box.",
      "Amad came close to making it 2-0 in the 20th minute, cutting inside from the left and into the penalty area, then unleashing a goal-bound left-footed strike which Sunderland 'keeper Robin Roefs did well to turn away.",
      "Roefs had to be alert again a couple of minutes later to repel a shot from Mbeumo, as United stepped up a gear in search of a second goal to give them some more breathing space.",
      "United skipper Bruno Fernandes saw a delightful chipped effort tipped onto the bar by Roefs, as the hosts laid siege to the goalmouth at the Stretford End.",
      "But the second goal duly came in the 31st minute, Benjamin Sesko reacting quickest to turn the loose ball into the net after a long throw-in from Diogo Dalot was flicked on by Sunderland's Nordi Mukiele.",
      "It was Sesko's second goal for United, having scored in the defeat at Brentford last weekend, and no more than Amorim's side deserved.",
      "The visitors did not provide much in the way of an attacking threat, but when they did, Lammens was there to deny them, getting down early to his left to keep out a low shot from Black Cats skipper Granit Xhaka.",
      "United survived a penalty scare in first-half added time when referee Stuart Attwell pointed to the spot following a high challenge from Sesko on Sunderland's Trai Hume. VAR checked the incident and after Attwell went to the pitchside monitor to review it, he reversed his original decision.",
      "Ultimately, United did enough in the first-half to secure the win ahead of a huge test after the international break – a trip to champions and arch rivals Liverpool.",

      "First-half goals from Mason Mount and Benjamin Sesko eased the pressure on Reds boss Ruben Amorim after a week of intense scrutiny of his position at Old Trafford. Amorim's side were lacklustre in defeat at Brentford last weekend but enjoyed a positive day at M16 against the Black Cats.",
      "United will now have the international break to reflect on what has been a difficult start to the season after finishing 15th in the top-flight last term - the club's lowest-ever Premier League finish.",
      "But Amorim has almost certainly earned himself some breathing room ahead of United's next fixture - a clash at bitter rivals Liverpool on October 19.",
      "The Reds' win over Sunderland has moved them up to eighth in the table for now, and supporters will have been pleased to see a positive debut from new goalkeeper Senne Lammens. Benjamin Sesko also impressed in a good afternoon for United.",

      "Manchester United's Premier League clash against Brentford has remained a trending topic eight days on from their 3-1 defeat.",

      "It is claimed that United did not want to make a 'public fuss' about the situation and appreciated Webb's rational explanation for why the mistake was made. Of course, had Collins been sent off the context of the game could have been a lot different with United having roughly 20 minutes against ten men to seek an equaliser.",

Do people not remember Alan Hansen criticising us, saying we’d win nothing with kids? That was the greatest and most successful centre-back of all time at that moment. Do they not think we got criticised during our careers? I’m sorry, you’re playing for Manchester United, it comes with the territory. You’ve got to step up. The players are a problem. The manager is a problem. The whole thing is a problem if you’re losing football matches to the level that Manchester United have been doing then… I don’t know, I never blamed anybody else when we lost football matches.",

You see him get on that left foot, with that much space, and he normally just curls that one in the bottom or top corner. But he was slightly off balance and it wasn’t quite meant to be. I still don’t think he’s at his best and he caused a lot of problems today without maybe the end product, but still the assist was still there. The end product is a little bit off but, again, he’s a brilliant signing for us and exactly what we needed.",

      "PGMO chief Howard Webb has reportedly admitted to Manchester United that Brentford defender Nathan Collins should have been sent off in their defeat on September 27.",
      "With United trailing 2-1 after an Igor Thiago brace which was pegged back by Benjamin Sesko, the Reds won a penalty after Collins tugged back Bryan Mbeumo inside the penalty area. The spot kick was rightly awarded but the punishment for Collins by referee Craig Pawson was merely a booking.",
      "Had Collins made a genuine attempt to play the ball, a booking would have sufficed in this scenario thanks to the recently introduced 'double jeopardy' rule. However, it seemed clear at the time that Collins did not make a genuine attempt and he was the last man, thus preventing Mbeumo having a goalscoring opportunity.",
      "The decision not to send off Collins would feel even more bitter when Bruno Fernandes missed his penalty and Mathias Jensen scored late to win the game 3-1. According to the Daily Mail, United chiefs Omar Berrada and Jason Wilcox sought clarification on the decision with Webb who admitted the mistake.",
      "It is claimed that United did not want to make a 'public fuss' about the situation and appreciated Webb's rational explanation for why the mistake was made. Of course, had Collins been sent off the context of the game could have been a lot different with United having roughly 20 minutes against ten men to seek an equaliser.",
      "What's more, the defeat caused significant pressure to mount on Ruben Amorim which may not have been the case had the match finished differently. MEN Sport understands that United are not currently considering sacking their Portuguese head coach.",
      "Despite reports stating that Gareth Southgate is among the names that Ineos are considering replacing Amorim with, there are believed to have been no contacts made with other managers regarding the currently filled position at Old Trafford. Fortunately for United, they put the defeat to Brentford behind them on Saturday with a 2-0 victory over Sunderland.",

      "Undoubtedly that will give Lammens a lift moving forwards but interestingly, the choice of chant taught us two things about the current goalkeeper situation. First and foremost, it was evidence of the competent display that the 23-year-old produced.",
      "As mentioned, he did not have to do anything too flashy to grab the headlines. He was confident, despite the pressured circumstances of his debut and that managed to filter out to the defenders in front of him and the fans behind him.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "But perhaps the more damning thing we were taught is just how starved this United crowd has been of a competent goalkeeper. When David de Gea left United in 2023, there was sadness at seeing him leave in such an undignified manner but few would have argued that it was the wrong call.",
      "De Gea was making some basic errors towards the end of his tenure at the club and there was an acceptance that he needed to be replaced. It was only thanks to the benefit of hindsight that we can say today that Erik ten Hag made an error replacing him.",
      "Andre Onana, on paper, was the right man to replace De Gea. He joined off the back of a Champions League final finish with Inter and his arrival promised to allow Ten Hag to play his natural style.",
      "Instead, United regressed with Onana as first-choice and the Cameroonian was seemingly blocked from playing out from the back to his defenders - the whole reason he was considered to be the top target for United in the summer of 2023. It was not all bad under Onana, he did make some good saves, but he lacked consistency and was largely incompetent at times for the Reds.",
      "Bayindir has suffered his own struggles with the weight of that shirt too. That is arguably not his fault as he was brought in as a back-up, not to uproot Onana.",
      "But comparing Lammens to Schmeichel after one good display, paints its own picture for United. The Reds have been crying out for just a steady goalkeeper to instill confidence and the early signs suggest they have just found that man.",

      "Matheus Cunha had \"nothing to say\" about being dropped for Manchester United's 2-0 win over Sunderland on Saturday.",
      "The Brazilian playmaker has been a welcome addition at Old Trafford since securing a £62.5million move from Wolverhampton Wanderers this summer, showing a wealth of potential despite failing to find the back of the net or register an assist just yet. However, Ruben Amorim opted to bench the 26-year-old when United played host to the Black Cats this weekend in favour of Mason Mount.",
      "The decision ultimately paid off for the Portuguese tactician, as Mount scored his first goal of the season eight minutes into the fixture, taking down a pinpoint cross from Bryan Mbeumo before bending the ball past an outstretched Robin Roefs.",
      "Cunha then replaced the goalscorer midway through the second half, by which time United had doubled their lead through Benjamin Sesko. The summer signing has since shared a post on social media.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "\"Nothing to say about how beautiful it is to win like this, at home and with the fans by our side,\" the message punctuated by a heart on fire emoji reads. Sunday is also a special day for the player, as his wife, Gabriela Nogueira da Cunha, celebrates her birthday.",
      "In a separate post, he shared a photo of himself, his wife and their son, Levi. The latter is wearing this season's third shirt, while Gabriela is wearing a retro long-sleeve top featuring the club's old crest.",
      "Translated into English from Portuguese, he captioned the post: \"Happy birthday, my love, you are our rock for every moment. Thankful for my wife, mother and friend every day. Me, Lele, and Liloca are in love with you\".",

    "body": [
      "Senne Lammens made quite the impression on his Manchester United debut this weekend - but a strong first showing doesn't always guarantee a long-term place in the first team.",
      "It's a lesson former United goalkeeper Dean Henderson learned the hard way. After dazzling in his first appearance for the club during a League Cup tie against Luton back in 2020, Henderson was tipped for the very top.",
      "Many - including then-manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer - saw him not just as United's future No. 1, but England's as well. Ultimately, though, neither prediction came to pass.",
      "With David de Gea firmly established ahead of him, Henderson found opportunities hard to come by. He later suggested that promises had been broken and admitted that his patience at Old Trafford \"wasted\" a large portion of his career.",
      "After joining United's academy in 2011, Henderson took his first steps into senior football on loan at Stockport County. His breakthrough, however, came at Sheffield United, where his standout performances in the club's 2019/20 Premier League campaign cemented his reputation as one of England's brightest talents.",
      "Interest in Henderson was high at the end of the season, but he decided to stay at United after reportedly being told he'd be first choice in a year's time. Things initially started brightly. After making what Henderson described as a \"dream\" debut for the club, he went on to make 26 appearances in all competitions in 2020/21.",
      "\"I dreamt about this my whole life!!\" Henderson wrote on social media after his first appearance in a United shirt. \"Unbelievable feeling to make my debut for the club I love! Clean sheet and a win to top it off!!!\"",
      "However, by the time the 2021/22 season rolled around, it was clear that De Gea would not only remain at the club, but also keep the No. 1 shirt - leaving Henderson understandably feeling let down.",
      "\"To sit there and waste 12 months is criminal really, at my age. I was fuming,\" he told talkSPORT in 2022. \"I turned so many good loans down last summer for that reason [being promised No.1 spot], and they wouldn't let me go. It was frustrating.\"",
      "Henderson took matters into his own hands, hurriedly organising a loan move to Nottingham Forest before new manager Erik ten Hag's arrival in the summer of 2022. \"I didn't really want the manager to come in and be able to see me in training because I knew he'd probably want to keep me,\" Henderson explained.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "\"So I tried to do it all before I left for the season, I told all the hierarchy I need to go and play football. I don't want to be here playing second fiddle. And it panned out so I was almost gone before the manager came in the door and I haven't spoken to him since.\"",
      "At the City Ground, Henderson finally got the game-time he'd been craving. But an ill-timed thigh injury ruled him out for the second half of the season, halting the momentum he'd finally been building.",
      "A permanent move to Crystal Palace followed in 2023, though his first season at Selhurst Park saw him share goalkeeping duties with Sam Johnstone. By the 2024/25 campaign, however, Henderson had truly come into his own - establishing himself as Palace's first-choice goalkeeper.",
      "He capped off the campaign in style, saving a penalty in Palace's remarkable 1-0 victory over Manchester City in the FA Cup final. Now, he stands as a key figure in the squad as the club embarks on its first-ever European adventure in the Conference League this season.",
      "United must be looking on with some regret. The man who was blocking Henderson's path, David de Gea, left the same summer the Red Devils academy graduate did. De Gea's successor, Andre Onana, then endured a difficult two-year spell between the posts before moving on loan to Trabzonspor last month.",
      "In the weeks since, Altay Bayindir has been tasked with filling the void, with mixed results. However, there is cause for optimism. Summer signing Senne Lammens made a bright impression during Saturday's 2-0 win over Sunderland, producing a couple of crucial saves to secure United's first clean sheet of the season.",
      "The Belgian also stood out for his composure, both on the ball and when facing shots, and looks well on his way to establishing himself as United's No. 1. But as Henderson's cautionary tale has taught us, a positive start doesn't guarantee anything.",

      "Amorim is wearing a full tracksuit on the touchline today and Dalot's long throw-in created the chance for Sesko to score. Tony Pulis would be proud of this proper Barclays football.",

This has left Ruben Amorim’s side level on points with Man City, who travel to Brentford on Sunday before the season pauses for the latest round of World Cup qualifiers.",

      "Man City and Man United launched their current strips ahead of the 2025/26 Premier League season to mixed reactions from fans. Perhaps the most unique of the strips is Man City’s third kit, which features a raindrop design said to be a ‘tribute to Mancunian weather’.",
      "It drew criticism from fans on social media, with one person harshly arguing that the designer ‘should be sacked’. Another said: “Not a bad shout to say this is the worst kit of all time.”",
      "It found some fans though, as this Blue said: “Wow, this is super cool.” Elsewhere, Man United fans were more positive to their club’s retro third strip inspired by the black away kit worn between 1993 and 1995.",
      "One Red said: “This looks amazing, Man United nailed the retro vibe.” Another said: “This is absolutely fire.”",
      "However, this fan had a more tongue-in-cheek response, saying: “Will look nice in the away end when they’re playing Stockport next season.”",

      "Manchester United boss Ruben Amorim has endured another few days to forget following on from last weekend's defeat to Brentford in the Premier League. That was United's fourth defeat of the season already with the upcoming fixture against Sunderland now very important to relieve pressure on his job.",
      "Despite being beaten 3-1 at the Gtech Community Stadium, MEN Sport reported earlier this week that Amorim retains the backing of United's hierarchy with no replacement being lined-up.",
      "There was at the very least one positive from Saturday with Benjamin Sesko on target. He has joined fellow summer signing Bryan Mbeumo in scoring his first goal for the club, but Matheus Cunha is still yet to find the back of the net.",
      "That attacking trio replaced the likes of Rasmus Hojlund, Marcus Rashford, Alejandro Garnacho, Jadon Sancho and Antony in the United squad. Those five players were all deemed surplus to requirements by Amorim but some already look to be proving that decision wrong.",
      "Since re-joining Real Betis, Antony has picked up a goal and assist while Sancho has looked bright in cameos for Aston Villa. However, it is the impact of the remaining three in Champions League action that has spoken volumes all while United are preparing for their next game.",

      "After a poor start to the season, Ruben Amorim's position in charge of Manchester United is under scrutiny.",
      "The Portuguese coach has recorded just 19 wins from 49 matches in his first 11 months with the club, and despite leading them to the final of the Europa League, he has failed to figure things out domestically. After finishing 15th in 2024/25, United currently sit 14th in the division this term, with just two wins from six matches.",
      "With that said, we round-up some of the latest news surrounding the former Sporting CP boss' future.",
      "Gareth Southgate would reject an approach from United in the event Amorim is sacked. The former England boss was previously among the top contenders to become United boss in March 2024.",
      "While Southgate's determination to focus on England ahead of the European Championships prevented United's desire to enter talks on that occasion, the coach is not out of work.",
      "The Daily Star reports however, that Southgate is in no rush to return to football, and continues to keep his options open. Perhaps crucially, Southgate is close friends with Dan Ashworth, whose long-term plan was to appoint Southgate during his time at United before departing after five months.",
      "\"One or two matches, you get flashes. They [United] played quite well against Arsenal on the opening day, but still lost.",
      "\"I've never seen a manager go about their business the way that Ruben Amorim is at the moment. It's a well-trodden path about his system and the fact that it maybe doesn't suit a lot of the players.",
      "\"But you're not telling me he shouldn't be doing better, even with that system. You look at the players at the back - Matthijs de Ligt, Harry Maguire - Bruno Fernandes going forward, [Matheus] Cunha and [Bryan] Mbeumo. They've got good players.",
      "\"It doesn't look like the right fit and that's putting it mildly. There's a lot of talk that they're not going to sack him until a certain date towards the end of this year to save a pay-off.",
      "\"It's difficult to read the minds of the hierarchy at United as to what they're thinking, but I think they know and everyone will be telling them that it is time for a change.\"",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "Few appear certain that Amorim's position is secure, with journalist Fabrizio Romano suggesting while the coach is not going to be sacked imminently, upcoming games could prove crucial.",
      "\"I'm not here saying that Amorim is absolutely safe,\" he said. \"Amorim’s job is not absolutely safe in this moment because they need to perform in a different way because Man United want to see results.",
      "\"But it doesn't mean that Manchester United have met with Southgate or already started the process to appoint Gareth Southgate as new boss.",
      "\"So let's wait. Let's see what happens. But for sure, the next games will be important for Ruben Amorim.\"",
      "Amorim may have one more month to convince United chiefs he is worth persisting with. It was previously reported that United may delay any sacking of Amorim until he reaches a year of service due to the substantial compensation package he would receive.",
      "As per the Daily Mail, United would need to pay up a hefty £12m bill if they sack the 40-year-old before he reaches 12 months in the hotseat.",
      "On the other hand, there are fears that Amorim could be the one to instigate the exit. United's co-owners, Ineos, are said to be worried that their boss might choose to resign before being dismissed.",
      "It is claimed that Amorim could do this in an attempt to preserve his managerial reputation, as he becomes increasingly frustrated by the constant criticism following losses.",
      "According to the i Newspaper, Sir Jim Ratcliffe and Ineos are prepared to stand by their manager but Amorim might soon have to contemplate stepping down to 'preserve his managerial career'.",
      "The United boss believes assessments of United's defeats can be 'knee-jerk' reactions and is reportedly taken aback by the intense scrutiny surrounding his managerial tenure.",

He was told it was now or never, and United had their man.",
      "While the club's stance worked - and had United started this season in good form we'd all be praising the decision to appoint him mid-season in getting the teething problems out of the way last term - their ultimatum may well have done more harm than good.",
      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe might be keen to view this campaign as Amorim's first at the club, but the disaster that was the 2024/25 season simply cannot be forgotten.",
      "The league campaign was nothing more than an inconvenience in the final months of the season. It was Europa League or bust and United produced a performance befitting their season in Bilbao as they surrendered to perennial nearly-men Tottenham.",
      "Had Amorim arrived in the summer, a new man full of new ideas with a winning reputation, the flurry of big-money moves and uplifting pre-season campaign would have been the perfect platform from which to launch the Amorim era.",
      "As it is, the United boss' methods will forever be synonymous with the worst United team in 51 years. Trying to convince a group of players that the system that led them to their worst season in half a century is the one that will bring the glory days back to Old Trafford is a tall order.",
      "It may well be that Amorim turns the ship around, but the United boss needs to starting picking up points and he needs to do it fast.",

    "body": [
      "Casemiro made a beeline for Ruud van Nistelrooy in the Old Trafford tunnel on his return with Leicester City in February.",
      "Van Nistelrooy, a fluent Spanish speaker, was the conduit between Casemiro and Erik ten Hag after his Portuguese-speaking assistant Mitchell van der Gaag left. Van Nistelrooy started Casemiro in all four of his matches as caretaker manager. Casemiro lingered as Van Nistelrooy spoke, as attached to him as a comfort blanket.",
      "At that time, Casemiro had not started for United in 39 days. He did not get a kick between December 30, the night of the Newcastle United debacle, and January 30. He emerged on 70 minutes in Bucharest with United 2-0 up. The transfer window was still open but the chances of United shifting Casemiro were, like the Trinity test igniting the atmosphere, near zero.",
      "People at United's Carrington training complex noticed Casemiro's personality never wavered during a trying first half of the season. They have always found him to be a warm presence.",
      "His transformation at United in the past two months has been as unexpected as their 3-0 triumph in Bilbao. This is the midfielder who was dropped for last year's FA Cup final and replaced by Toby Collyer with United 2-0 down to Liverpool at half-time eight months ago. Casemiro’s declaration that he was keen to see out his contract in March was framed as more bad news for the club.",
      "Casemiro used his head before Athletic lost theirs in San Mames. Returning to Spain emboldens Casemiro. In San Sebastián and Bilbao, he has reminded Spanish audiences he can still cut it nearly three years on from leaving their shores. United supporters serenaded Casemiro on Thursday night.",
      "The draw with Real Sociedad in mid-March has marked a late turning point in Casemiro's third season in Manchester. With Manuel Ugarte out injured, Ruben Amorim had little choice but to turn to the older defensive midfielder.",
      "Casemiro has since been a fixture in the United starting XI, his importance highlighted by the early withdrawal at Bournemouth last week to preserve him for Bilbao. Ugarte admitted this week he is copying him.",
      "Within a matter of months, Casemiro has gone from unsellable to undroppable. If or when United reach the Europa League final, Casemiro is a shoo-in in midfield. The 3-4-2-1 system Amorim swears by has closed the yawning gaps that developed between the defence and midfield under Ten Hag and Casemiro has the safety net of a third centre back.",
      "United have adjusted Casemiro’s running and pressing triggers. “I think he has improved a lot also,” Amorim opined. “You can see not the way he plays but the way he runs. You can see it, we have the data to show him where he worked really hard.",
      "“He is a very good example. Even Toby sometimes was playing in front of him and [that] it is hard to take for Casemiro. So it is a lesson for all the players in Manchester United.",
      "“No matter what is the past or the last month, everything can change in one moment. Then we understood that he cannot jump all the time pressing high. We need to let him understand and sometimes it is better to put three defenders and let him be the fourth defender and put the wing-backs pressing high. These are all things we are understanding and trying to cope with all the criticisms of the team. But the credit is for Casemiro.”",
      "Amorim has been impressed by how hard Casemiro has worked to meet his demands to regain his place in the team. He noticed that he never complained during those winter weeks warming the bench.",
      "Selflessness is a natural trait of Casemiro's. It was also his undoing this time last year. With United depleted at centre half, he dropped back and was humiliated in the 4-0 drubbing by Crystal Palace.",
      "With Kobbie Mainoo and Christian Eriksen a flimsy shield and Jonny Evans his creaking partner, Casemiro abandoned his position to engage Michael Olise, overcommitted, lost his balance and Olise scored. Six days later, he trundled out of the United third and played Arsenal winger Gabriel Martinelli onside to square for Leandro Trossard’s tap-in. Sofyan Amrabat was ushered back in from the cold and played his way into the FA Cup final XI.",
      "Jamie Carragher urged Casemiro to “leave the football before the football leaves you”. Casemiro had been pencilled in to flank Amorim for pre-match press duties against Athletic and he would be a worthy choice at Carrington next week. He is a positive story again and one of the squad’s figureheads. United view Casemiro as a quiet leader, mind.",
      "The 33-year-old shared Raphael Varane’s view that a “disconnect” had developed between the players and Ten Hag. It is not a coincidence that Casemiro scored two goals in the first game after Ten Hag was finally sacked. He was committed enough to claim the last goal of the Ten Hag era at West Ham.",
      "When Casemiro discussed the possibility of joining United, he wanted to know three things: where he would live, where he would train and where the stadium was. During FaceTime conversations, he requested to see the club’s gymnasium at Carrington.",
      "United sources have been struck by how leaner Casemiro is this season. People in Madrid said Casemiro used to be in the club's Valdebebas gym at 8am and he often has gym sessions before and after training at Carrington.",
      "Casemiro has struck up a close rapport with some of the masseurs and his English is now a very good level of conversational. He understood our questions in the mixed zone two years ago, when his handshake grip was as tight as a vice. Casemiro's wife, Anna, and children Sara and Caio, are happy in Manchester amid the prospect of a fourth year in England's north west.",
      "Staff at Carrington regard Casemiro as one of the most respectful players they have encountered and that he is strident in protecting the club's image. Sir Jim Ratcliffe dubbed Casemiro as \"overpaid\" and \"not good enough\" in March. Three days later, Casemiro trumped his first-leg performance against Sociedad in the 4-1 win at Old Trafford.",
      "His steep decline over 18 months - dropped for Amrabat, substituted for Collyer, omitted from the Brazil squad - makes Casemiro’s revival so singular. If United win the Europa League it would be churlish to argue someone who has won three trophies in three seasons has been an unsuccessful signing.",
      "Casemiro drove United to a successful 2022-23 season. Without him, they would not have qualified for the Champions League. Ten Hag dubbed him the “cement between the stones”, essentially the glue in the team. Casemiro was central to the Latino rebranding of the United defence that kept the most clean sheets in the Premier League.",
      "Casemiro has returned to that level of influence he wielded in his first season. In Europe, at least. The concern if United do not triumph in Bilbao again this month is Casemiro could be redundant in a campaign devoid of Champions League midweeks. His recent domestic form has been inoffensive but not stellar and United need a young and dynamic new central midfielder in the summer.",
      "The senior figures made the difference in Bilbao, though. Casemiro and Bruno Fernandes, two 30-something Portuguese speakers, are naturally close.",
      "“We've got a lot of senior players who need to step up in their moments,” Harry Maguire explained. “I think Case was brilliant tonight. Bruno as well. So we have senior players who need to handle these moments really well.”",
      "Van Nistelrooy, a champion of Casemiro’s, merits credit for that.",

      "Chelsea have risen to the top of the Premier League prize money table alongside Liverpool as one of four teams to be picked for TV four times in November.",
      "Premier League clubs received a total of £2.83billion last season, which was comprised of six payments through the division’s ‘central revenue system’, something the Premier League says ‘ensures the most equitable distribution of funds of any major European league’.",
      "Liverpool were paid £174.9m as champions – short of Manchester City’s record £176.2m in 2022/23 – while Newcastle received just over £160m to chuck into their PSR black hole.",
      "Southampton were handed £109.2m for their efforts in finishing a distant bottom. It pays to be in the Premier League.",
      "Some of those payments are fixed. All 20 clubs automatically receive around £96.9m through an equal share distributed based on both the domestic (£29.8m in 2024/25) and international (£59.2m in 2024/25) broadcast deals – those TV rights are lucrative for a reason – as well as £7.9m each from central commercial revenue streams.",
      "The rest is variable, based on where clubs finish and how often their games are selected for broadcast.",
      "",
      "The Premier League merit payments are distributed on a sliding scale from 1st to 20th, made up of combined earnings from domestic and international broadcast deals.",
      "For the 2024/25 season, the difference in prize money was around £2.7m per position. Southampton were given as much for finishing bottom, all the way up to champions Liverpool receiving £53.1m. It basically helped pay for 97.4% of Giorgi Mamardashvili and Jeremie Frimpong.",
      "That can be expected to fluctuate with inflation and other factors – it was around £2.8m per position in 2023/24 – but it offers a rough guide as to what clubs should expect to earn this season.",
      "",
      "1st (Liverpool) – £53.1m",
      "2nd (Arsenal) – £50.4m",
      "3rd (Crystal Palace) – £47.7m",
      "4th (Spurs) – £45m",
      "5th (Sunderland) – £42.4m",
      "6th (Bournemouth) – £39.8m",
      "7th (Manchester City) – £37.1m",
      "8th (Chelsea) – £34.5m",
      "9th (Brighton) – £31.9m",
      "10th (Fulham) – £29.1m",
      "11th (Leeds) – £26.5m",
      "12th (Everton) – £23.8m",
      "13th (Brentford) – £21.2m",
      "14th (Manchester United) – £18.6m",
      "15th (Newcastle) – £15.9m",
      "16th (Aston Villa) – £13.3m",
      "17th (Nottingham Forest) – £10.7m",
      "18th (Burnley) – £7.9m",
      "19th (West Ham) – £5.2m",
      "20th (Wolves) – £2.7m",
      "",
      "The only other part of the prize money which is not fixed and shared equally are the facility fees, which are based on how many times each club has been selected for television.",
      "In 2024/25, Liverpool had 30 games televised in the UK, for which they received £24.9m in facility fees. Arsenal had 29 matches and were paid £24.2m, while Manchester United (28 games for £23.4m), Aston Villa (27 games for £22.6m) and Chelsea (26 games for £21.8m) were televised frequently and rewarded handsomely.",
      "Ipswich were shown on the fewest occasions and received £8.9m in facility fees for their 10 live televised UK fixtures.",
      "This can lead to discrepancies in terms of those variable payments. Manchester United’s prize money after finishing 15th last season was £136.2m, more than the four clubs immediately above them – West Ham (£130.9m in 14th), Everton (£131.8m in 13th), Crystal Palace (£136.1m in 12th) and Fulham (£135.5m in 11th) – as Ruben Amorim’s side were picked for far more live TV games.",
      "Spurs were another massive outlier, earning more in 17th (£127.8m) than Wolves did in 16th (£123.1m) in part because they had nine more games picked for live UK broadcast.",

      "",

      "Ruben Amorim ought to be a sack race shoo-in but Sir Jim Ratcliffe’s thriftiness and the worst start to a Forest reign in a century keeps the Manchester United manager in Ange Postecoglou’s slipstream.",
      "Graham Potter was sacked by West Ham – even that they managed to make a pig’s ear of – and replaced by sack-race winner Nuno Espirito Santo, who will duly return somewhere in the middle of the pack here in due course.",
      "We can only assume that Potter will therefore replace Postecoglou, Nuno’s replacement at Nottingham Forest, at the City Ground as the Aussie is the favourite to be binned next, replacing Amorim, who is probably still in a job so United can save a few quid on his pay-off.",
      "The managerial merry-go-round has never felt more real.",
      "Meanwhile, here are possible replacement managers currently between jobs. Pretty much every one of them would have avoided defeat to Grimsby Town, we reckon.",
      "",
      "An earlier version of this oft-updated piece speculated on what might happen to Mikel Arteta should Arsenal suffer from their Nightmare Start. What if they lost a few early games? What then? We concluded this:",
      "It’s far likelier that Arsenal emerge blinking into the autumn sunshine broadly unscathed from their nightmare horrors. No denying that this season does represent one in which Arteta might completely lose the plot and go entirely off the rails. Or the one where he wins the league by 10 points. Feels like we’re odds-on to get one or the other.",
      "Arsenal emerged duly unscathed, and have already cashed in on the shift to easier fixtures of their own alongside much tougher ones for Liverpool to take top spot in the Premier League.",
      "Only question that remains, therefore, is what Arsenal do from here. We are absolutely certain that it either involves p*ssing the league by 10 points or a complete and total meltdown. Nothing in between. We’re definitely leaning towards the former, though.",
      "READ: Who will be the next manager of Arsenal if Mikel Arteta is sacked?",
      "",
      "Among the least sackable managers in the top flight, and the only club we could really picture trying to lure him away this summer was Spurs and that’s now safely off the table.",
      "It was a difficult summer for Bournemouth but Iraola had masses of credit in the bank and the excellent start they’ve made despite everything is only strengthening his standing.",
      "",
      "Things would have to go unbelievably wrong unbelievably fast, but this is Everton so, you know. Maybe. And there are few things that straddle the blessing-curse divide in football quite like a new stadium.",
      "The benefits Everton should accrue come in the long term. In the short term there’s the loss of familiarity and – something that feels specifically important in this particular case – atmosphere while everyone gets used to the new surroundings.",
      "Defeat at Leeds on the opening weekend was distinctly squibbish, but Everton have bounced back in some style since to suggest they could not just survive but thrive. With Jack Grealish in impish early-season form, they might even be fun. Ending Crystal Palace’s unbeaten run in such dramatic circumstances was certainly that.",
      "",
      "It is still very early days and still too early to tell which way a promising-but-not-flawless start eventually breaks for Frank and Spurs.",
      "He arrived to a club and squad with an awful lot of mess to sort out at history’s funniest ever Champions League qualifiers. He appeared to have already thoroughly De-Anged the lot of them only for them to then turn up against Bournemouth and defend like an Ange team while attacking like a Mourinho one.",
      "You know who else won their first couple of games, including one against Man City, after stepping up to Spurs from a smaller but less daft Premier League club? That’s right. But while the Nuno comparisons are obvious, and a world in which Frank doesn’t make the November international break entirely possible, it doesn’t quite feel like the same situation.",
      "Crucially, there has been no undignified scramble to find a new manager this time. Whatever your thoughts on the timing and manner of Ange Postecoglou’s sacking and the identity of his replacement, it’s also clear Spurs have got the man they wanted in a way they very obviously didn’t when Nuno came in.",
      "That surely buys Frank a bit of time even if things do get hairy, which they haven’t done yet. Certainly a few others going to get canned before he does. Probably.",
      "",
      "West Ham at home was a kind start for Sunderland and Le Bris, but boy did they cash in. Came back down to earth with a bump at Burnley, but the late turnaround to beat Brentford plus another win at Nottingham Forest have everything looking peachy. And most sides are going to be pretty happy any time they take a point from Palace this season, we reckon.",
      "Losing at Old Trafford is quite embarrassing, though.",
      "",
      "At various points we’ve expended daft amounts of energy attempting to manifest a ‘Howe Sack’ crisis because we’re messy bitches who live for drama. But we’ve never managed to make it stick even a tiny bit and we started the summer thinking there was little imminent prospect of going for it again with Howe the hero of the Geordie Nation for delivering silverware and more lovely, lovely Champions League football.",
      "Now, though, after a traumatic summer and the Alexander Isak Saga and a sometimes iffy start to the season, our Spidey Sense is tingling once more. We’re going to be right back in the saddle come November after a run of two draws and a defeat leaves the Magpies seven points outside the top six.",
      "",
      "A sacking remains out of the question despite last season’s (relative) struggles. There hasn’t been a Premier League manager since Fergie in his pomp with more credit in the bank than Pep.",
      "But is there still a distinct chance Guardiola decides he’s had enough and simply walks away? We reckon there is, and it’s always worth remembering that we’re talking Next Premier League Manager To Leave here, and that the traditional ‘Sack Race’ shorthand is a bit misleading.",
      "Still, though. Almost no chance at this point that any of that could happen swiftly enough for nobody else to have been canned first.",
      "",
      "Fine end to 24/25 put a different complexion on Brighton’s season than at one time appeared likely. Ending up a clear best of the rest outside the quickly established top seven represented at least a passing grade and they’d have to make a truly awful start to the season to get in any kind of managerial-change bother.",
      "Victory at Chelsea to go with a win over City reaffirms Brighton’s big-boy-bothering calibre, but does also make some of their other results – draws with Fulham and Wolves, for instance – a bit annoying.",
      "",
      "Won’t be sacked, obviously, because Palace are absolutely punching with an elite-level manager who is quietly delivering astonishing results in trying circumstances.",
      "But with reports he was willing and ready to walk out if Marc Guehi was sold without a replacement point to new strains on a relationship that is bound to be tested in the weeks and months ahead.",
      "Nailed it in the Community Shield, but as ever for clubs on Palace’s level there’s a positive-and-negative scale to be balanced by your manager catching the eye so conspicuously. Glasner absolutely could be poached with bigger beasts surely paying attention to the work he’s done at Selhurst Park.",
      "And if that poaching comes from outside the Premier League, then it comes with the possibility of making Glasner the next Premier League managerial casualty. But still very unlikely.",
      "The nerves at Selhurst Park will really kick in if/when Ruben Amorim gets the tin tack.",
      "",
      "The continuity candidate, but how much continuity can there be at Brentford given they’ve sold Bryan Mbeumo, Yoane Wissa and Christian Norgaard, while Thomas Frank took most of the remaining coaching staff with him to Tottenham? It’s a very Brentford move to promote from within but will they be forced into the very un-Brentford move of sacking him in October or November if and when the Bees are in a relegation battle?",
      "Currently benefiting twice from the Ruben Amorim situation, gleefully helping himself to a much-needed win over a man also helping to keep him and others away from the head of this market.",
      "",
      "Burnley really did have a horrible fixture list in these opening weeks under a manager with a horrible record at this level, and were given an opening-day reminder by the team that finished 17th last season of just how much harder the ‘simply don’t concede any goals at all’ tactic is going to be to deliver in the Premier League.",
      "Essentially, Burnley have got back to this level the same way Homer Simpson got to a heavyweight title fight. And Spurs and City have already given them a pummelling.",
      "Victory over Sunderland was an impressive and necessary reminder that it might still be enough against teams more on their level, but Parker will still need some fairly early evidence it can also work against established Premier League teams, which makes Burnley’s start so problematic and that win over Sunderland both vital yet potentially deceptive.",
      "There were encouraging signs before late heartbreak against eternally stupid Manchester United and against champions-elect Liverpool. A point against Forest was certainly a step in the right direction, but they are firmly in the bottom three as we reach the October international break where club decision-makers do start to get antsy.",
      "",
      "That’s what a pair of back-to-back league defeats sandwiching a European setback will do. One minute you’ve won five games out of five and everyone is handing you another Premier League title, the next you find yourself level with Scott Parker in the Sack Race. Life comes at you fast.",
      "",
      "Just a slightly less clear-cut version of Glasner really. Not about to be sacked, but could be in the frame for a poaching. And if that poaching comes from outside the Premier League, then he could technically be the next manager to go.",
      "",
      "Wolves absolutely love a sh*tbone awful start and enforced managerial change around November. The loss of key players and a disappointingly limp finish to last season after that thrilling run of wins through March and April mean those old doubts were nagging away even before a woeful pre-season, an opening-day paddling from new-look, old-destructiveness Man City and further defeats to Bournemouth, Everton, Newcastle United and now Leeds.",
      "Pereira should theoretically be fine after the work he did in steering Wolves so comfortably clear of any relegation trouble last season contributed heavily to him being give a new three-year contract in September. But making terrible starts that leave them in apparent relegation trouble before surviving comfortably in the end after a managerial change appears to now be ingrained in the club culture, an issue that transcends players and managers.",
      "Looked set to get the full benefit of good ol’ Dr Tottenham before having to settle for a point that really should have been three; they were much the better side in a low-quality caper.",
      "Sent off in the 1-1 draw with Wolves for ‘irresponsible behaviour in the technical area’. Which we just love. Was he running with scissors? Did he return to a lit firework? Buy some alcohol for some youths?",
      "",
      "One of the key early-season imponderables for 25/26 was just how big and what kind of impact the Club World Cup might have on the way Chelsea and Man City start the season. Would they hit the ground running, or would they be a bit tired and out of sorts? For both, it’s been rather more of the latter than the former.",
      "He definitely still has some hearts and minds to win at Chelsea despite the fine finish to the season that saw them tick off Champions League qualification while completing their collection of UEFA pots and pans and then winning the actual Club World Cup.",
      "A home draw with Crystal Palace wasn’t ideal, but the paddling dished out to West Ham has what really should at least be some kind of halfway credible title bid up and running at least. And we strongly suspect Fulham won’t be the last team left scratching their head after losing to Maresca.",
      "There was some talk of ‘Maresca out’ after a draw with Brentford but that was surely only a minority view. After losing to Manchester United in shambolic fashion, there were more on the bandwagon.",
      "That win over Liverpool was big, though, and a particularly good one for Maresca himself.",
      "",
      "It would have made Spurs’ decision to sack Europa League-winning Ange Postecoglou look positively kind, but there remains a decent case that Leeds – and Burnley for that matter – could or even should have thanked the managers who secured 100 Championship points and got them back into the big time and then sent them on their way.",
      "Farke had a dreadful Premier League record of only six wins and 26 points from his 49 games in charge of Norwich, a team he twice led to promotion from the Championship with 94 and 97 points.",
      "As well as fighting his own record in this competition, Farke faces the added burden of expectation levels very different to those at just about any other club that could possibly find itself promoted into the Premier League in this current era where that represents the most bittersweet of successes.",
      "Leeds’ lack of firepower against teams wallowing in slightly less despair than Wolves remains a concern, but two wins from the opening seven games to go with creditable draws against Newcastle and Bournemouth ought to be plenty enough to keep Farke gainfully employed, for now.",
      "",
      "Really isn’t that long ago that Emery was listed among your Slots and your Iraolas in this market, but it’s been an alarmingly bleak start to the season for a striving club with lofty ambitions but a worrisome balance sheet.",
      "Missing out on the Champions League in the manner they did at the end of last season was definitely a p*sser, and while Villa were perfectly good last season, it was one that felt a bit flat in the end. It was good, but it could have been great. They could have finished in the top five. They could have won the FA Cup. They could even have knocked out PSG in the Champions League after thar barnstorming Villa Park comeback.",
      "These annoyances are real and meaningful, and have leaked into this season. They are already out of the Carabao and took until the fifth game of the season just to score a Premier League goal that still wasn’t enough to secure a first victory of the season at 10-man Sunderland.",
      "But the win over Fulham was much, much better and beating Feyenoord and then Burnley for four wins in a row feels restorative.",
      "",
      "Feels like one could still, if one were so inclined, make the case for him being both top and bottom of this list.",
      "Top because United were staggeringly and at times unwatchably bad last season, as well as bottling the Europa League final in truly dismal fashion against planet earth’s most notorious pot-dodgers, and haven’t delivered anything conspicuously better in the early weeks of this season. Bottom because United have so clearly and determinedly nailed their colours to the Amorim mast that they might just stick with him out of pure stubbornness.",
      "But can he survive defeat to Grimsby Town? Should he? Victory over Burnley helps, but it could scarcely have been less convincing. And my word, they looked broken against Manchester City. We said at the time that the wild 10-man win over 10-man Chelsea was not a turning point; Brentford proved it.",
      "At this point, Sir Jim and his nowhere-to-be-seen pals are probably sitting tight, waiting for a year to pass just to save a few quid on his pay-off. In which case, Amorim and United have a month before both can be put out of their misery.",
      "READ: Who will be the next Man Utd manager if Ruben Amorim is sacked?",
      "",
      "Postecoglou’s football is high-risk, high-reward but the increasing body of Premier League evidence does now point to it being quite dramatically and fundamentally flawed at this level.",
      "He is currently trying – and failing – to deploy it with a Forest squad far less suited than Tottenham, especially in terms of defensive pace, mobility and technical ability. Throw in the fact that when it did work at Spurs, it worked early on due to its shock-and-awe newness before everyone figured it all out. There has been no early benefit reaped at Forest. Actually the opposite is true.",
      "Postecoglou is the first Forest manager in a hundred years – an actual century – to go winless in his first six matches in charge. And it’s now seven after defeat at Newcastle.",
      "It helps not that he replaced a popular figure but the shadow of Nuno would be no inconvenience if Forest weren’t shipping goals for fun while showcasing all the flaws associated with Angeball. Fifteen goals conceded, seven from set-pieces, is it? Stunning.",
      "What Postecoglou needs is a patient owner willing to wait for an undefinable period in the forlorn hope the new manager’s messages might eventually land. He’s got Evangelos Marinakis.",

      "When Ruben Amorim prophesised after his first match in charge of Manchester United that “we are going to suffer for a long period,” he perhaps didn’t realise he was issuing the most egregious understatement in human history.",
      "Before Saturday, that 1-1 draw against Ipswich 314 days ago was the last time Manchester United scored in the opening ten minutes of a Premier League game. And an inability to start strong ranks absurdly low on the list of causes for these unnecessarily agonising year-long growing pains.",
      "But Manchester United failing to build on those leads or even just capitalise on brief moments of ascendancy has been an infuriating trait. So too their incompetence in simply trying to keep a clean sheet.",
      "No-one will be foolish enough to read too far into a 2-0 win over Sunderland secured through goals in the eighth and 31st minutes, buttressed by a stable and secure defensive platform. Not when the infernal search for consecutive Premier League wins will take in a visit to Anfield after the international break.",
      "Yet this was the club’s best performance of the season in a ‘must-win’ game for the manager.",
      "It is, of course, heartening that this Manchester United hierarchy might still be making decisions based on the circumstances of one fixture. If one stunning FA Cup final can keep Erik ten Hag in employment well beyond the glaringly obvious end of his road, setting this eternal restoration project back at least another year or so, then why shouldn’t a home win over promoted opposition secure Amorim’s future for the remainder of the season?",
      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe and the INEOS brains trust would ideally never learn any lessons ever, perennially extending this exasperating process by ignoring every issue and clinging to all potential positives.",
      "Sure, Old Trafford is surrounded by myriad dumpster fires but at least they’re generating enough light and warmth to save on the energy bill and avert any further redundancies.",
      "It should be said that this was a rare break from the “suffering”. Manchester United were competent against Sunderland. Good, even. Great at times. Mason Mount continues to prove himself to be any manager’s favourite player, Amad and Bryan Mbeumo have formed a tantalising link on the right, and Benjamin Sesko needed only one gilt-edged chance rather than three in succession to score.",
      "And on his Premier League debut, Senne Lammens kept the club’s first clean sheet of the season. He was hardly needed to produce the sort of volume of saves which attracted Manchester United to his ability in the first place, but one confident claim from a high Noah Sadiki cross was greeted with rapturous applause and very possibly a few disbelieving supporters fainting in the stands.",
      "Robin Roefs was once again more outwardly impressive at the other end, tipping a wonderful Bruno Fernandes effort onto the bar in his most eye-catching stop. But Manchester United twice found a way through one of the better defensive teams in this myriad Premier League season and wholly deserved their win.",
      "It is vanishingly rare that everything Amorim touches turns to gold. But the Lammens call, bringing Leny Yoro in for Harry Maguire, even dropping Matheus Cunha for Mount were all vindicated.",
      "Kobbie Mainoo got his 13-minute cameo, Casemiro was substituted before he was given the opportunity to get stupidly sent off, and Amorim managed to both have and eat his cake with a trademark centre-half swap with five minutes remaining as Sunderland laboured to find anything resembling a foothold.",
      "Regis Le Bris even felt compelled to alter his system in the first half to match the hosts with the introduction of large Dan Ballard. Amorim, for once, had no reason to follow suit.",
      "He knows “results dictate everything”. Amorim had ventured into the ever so slightly desperate before the game with his controversial rework of a John Lennon classic, saying: “Imagine if we had won the first game against Arsenal, hadn’t missed the penalty, and had won against Fulham even without playing well.”",
      "His basic point was that winning breeds confidence and fine margins have often been the difference. But it is gloriously quaint to hear the manager of Manchester United essentially say: “Imagine if we had just won these games.”",
      "This weekend and over the international break, they need no such creative thinking. An entirely routine, straightforward victory with no suffering in sight might be the most significant result of Amorim’s reign yet.",
      "Ruben Amorim ought to be a sack race shoo-in but Man Utd’s thriftiness and the worst start to a Forest reign in a century keeps him in Ange Postecoglou’s slipstream.",
      "Erling Haaland has been a Premier League player for barely three seasons but has already outscored a legion of legends and is firing Norway to the World Cup.",
      "Man Utd are “not going to rush into a decision” over sacking Ruben Amorim as a journalist reveals the likelihood of the Red Devils head coach resigning.",
      "Man Utd legend Gary Neville insists the Red Devils hierarchy will be “relieved” at the win over Sunderland but Ruben Amorim is not “off the hook”.",
      "Liverpool are officially in a ‘mini crisis’ which Arne Slot and two players in particular seems to be making worse. Chelsea and Enzo Maresca took advantage.",
      "Liverpool’s “mess” is worse than it initially seemed as this form of Arne Slot’s side have no chance of winning the Premier League title this season…"

      "When Ange was appointed, he wasn’t everyone’s choice but like many fans, we did want to give him a chance. I read a lot from Spurs fans and a few pieces on F365 saying how he will be a disaster, the players will start to pick up injuries, there is no real patterns of play apart from running around a lot, we will concede a lot from set pieces and most importantly, will lose a lot of games.",
      "I thought this was a harsh and an almost ungrateful approach from Spurs fans, especially given the trophy he delivered and that the league form was a sacrifice towards delivering this.",
      "Spurs fans (and F365), i apologise and you were 100% right.",
      "The one positive thing i would say about Ange is that the time he has taken to deliver his style of play and principles has been incredibly quick. Unfortunately his style, coaching and tactics are sh*t. Last night pretty much ticked the Ange bingo card – centre back getting injured, player rushed back after injury and getting injured again, goals conceded from set plays, possession with few chances created. And, again, most importantly, losing a game that should really have been a comfortable win.",

      "We’ve probably all read about and then tried to ignore all of the stuff about men’s mental health and the epidemic of male suicide that we’re currently living in the middle of, and it is an epidemic any way you look at it – up by 30% in the last 10 years, now the leading cause of death for men under 50 and male suicide now counts for 80% of all suicide. And the best, only, way we have of combating this is to be able to talk about bad things that happen when they happen, but we’re crap at it.",
      "Diogo Jota’s death is tragic on many levels, firstly and most obviously to his family, friends and those who knew him and that’s what the Liverpool players are dealing with at the moment. Grief is hard and it comes at you sideways and repeatedly. The idea that the players dealt with his death with one emotional evening at Anfield and then moved on is madness, but we all struggle to talk about the fact that the pain for the players (and fans) is still there and will be for a good while yet.",
      "Their heads aren’t clearly not in it and we have to be able to say that out loud and understand that that’s both really sad but also completely okay and normal (and then, crucially, not murder them for it on social media and in the press).",
      "When the autobiographies come out in a few years time and we learn the real story behind this season it’ll be obvious that the thing affecting the start of this season wasn’t the new formation or Florian Wirtz getting up to the speed of the league, it was, as it clearly is, a group of people struggling with how to cope with a tragedy. And the way we all keep ignoring it in the conversation just shows how far we still have to go in learning to communicate with each other when things go South.",

      "While many would have sent Ruben Amorim packing from Manchester United already and almost all others would see an inevitable defeat to high-flying Sunderland on Saturday as the final straw, amid reports claiming that Sir Jim Ratcliffe will give the Portuguese boss a full season as he fails to come to terms with yet another Old Trafford mistake, Amorim is indeed set to survive the upcoming international break.",
      "But in clarifying the full-season “yardstick” Ratcliffe and Ineos will use to decide his future, journalist Ben Jacobs has confirmed his sacking in the next international break.",
      "“Ruben Amorim, I think, doesn’t have that many games to turn things around,” Jacobs said. “I’m not so sure, despite the fact that I respect other reports, that it’s as clear-cut as he’ll get a full season. Speaking to people in and around the club, he’ll get 38 games split across two seasons and they’ll use that somewhat as a yardstick.”",

      "It will have been seen as an absolute banker by Manchester United fans trawling the fixture list at the start of the season. An Old Trafford clash against newly-promoted Sunderland, who have beaten United just twice in the Premier League in 30 meetings, losing 22 of them, since Michael Gray and John Mullin goals earned them all three points in March 1997, give it a tick and move on.",
      "But six games into the season we’re wondering if there is a worse fixture for Amorim and United to be playing. Sunderland are sixth having conceded just four goals in those six games, and while no-one expects them to hold that position, there also won’t be many still considering them as relegation candidates. They’ve got good players, a good manager and crucially – in stark contrast to United – are a team.",
      "And yet, they are still Sunderland. They’ve still only just come up, they’ve still got plenty of players in their first Premier League season, just like their manager. It would therefore still be written up as a disaster of biblical proportions if United were to lose to them.",

      "Amorim said afterwards that he was “upset” United didn’t claim all three points, but while we’re all doing our level best to insist Premier League leaders Liverpool are currently in the midst of a mini-crisis and defeat to Chelsea on Saturday would ensure a full-blown one for us all to ruminate over for the international break, it’s hard to imagine the level of catastrophe required for Arne Slot’s side not to beat United at Anfield.",

      "",
      "This fixture last season was very nearly the end of Amorim, who had reportedly become so ‘disenchanted’ with life at United after a run of one Premier League win in six culminated in the 3-1 defeat to the Seagulls at Old Trafford that he was ‘prepared to resign’ and had to be talked off the ledge by the United bosses.",
      "Despite there being ‘no formal move to quit’ after the game in January, the Portuguese head coach ‘had to be reassured by senior figures at the club, including CEO Omar Berrada, that he would be backed to turn the team’s fortunes around.’",
      "We don’t know how Amorim could see a summer in which United failed to sign a new No.6 or No.1 as one in which he received sufficient backing, but it feels as though he’s been on the brink of resignation as well as the sack pretty much ever since.",
      "Fabian Hurzeler has already led Brighton to victories over Manchester City and Chelsea this season. 1-2.",

      "Ange Postecoglou being sacked twice before Ruben Amorim after beating him in the Europa League final is both brilliant and famously unjust in equal measure, if it wasn’t definitely actually slightly more brilliant than unjust.",

      "Amorim is f***ed either way. Ange got the better of him three times last season – 1-0 wins in the UEL final and the Premier League and a 4-3 in the League Cup quarter-final. United also lost both games to Forest and if Ange has gone then they may still be in the midst of a new manager bounce, which they’re due having experienced more of a splat post Nuno-Espirito Santo.",

      "From beating Newcastle United to several summer signings to recently gaining the favour of Glasner, Man Utd’s lure is still overwhelming, so when it came to making a decision, it would be a surprise if Iraola said no to INEOS.",

      "Regardless of how this weekend’s match against Sunderland goes (another harrowing loss wouldn’t be a shock at all), Amorim is done at Man Utd because he won’t oversee a long-term fix amid his unrelenting insistence on playing his 3-4-3 formation, which is not suited to the club or his squad.",
      "The sooner he and Man Utd move on, the better, though talk regarding a caretaker appointment is nonsense, as INEOS cannot be seen to write off a season after fewer than ten games.",
      "So, a repeat of last year’s raid for Amorim is needed; only this time to appoint a proven Premier League head coach, with the potential to become elite, who adopts a front-foot playing style and formation that naturally lends itself to the United way.",
      "In hindsight, INEOS’ appointment of Amorim was a huge mistake, but the ruthless manner in which they went about this raid should be commended as a deal was struck under the noses of Man City, who appeared to be laying the groundwork for Amorim to replace Pep Guardiola.",
      "The same mid-season method is required for standout candidate Iraola, mainly due to his potential, suitability and the underlying risk of disappointment in the summer amid heavy competition from across Europe.",

      "Hear us out. Ruben Amorim to Nottingham Forest and Ange Postecoglou to Manchester United in a manager swap deal actually makes sense…",
      "Over the past year, our Premier League sack race leaderboard has been dominated by Amorim and Postecoglou, who are currently first and second (or 20th and 19th?) in the standings.",
      "In Postecoglou‘s case, this is mightily impressive as he has changed clubs and arguably remains under as much scrutiny as Amorim, who is still on the brink at Man Utd.",
      "Postecoglou could and perhaps should have hammered the final nail in Amorim’s coffin at Man Utd when his Spurs side did a job on the Red Devils to win last season’s Europa League. However, it was Big Ange, whose position at Tottenham remained untenable amid their dire Premier League form, who was sacked following the match.",
      "Amorim, meanwhile, was backed with Man Utd’s £230m summer spend on signings intended to make his squad more capable of thriving in his preferred 3-4-3 formation.",
      "There was pre-season optimism at Man Utd, as there often is, but this has swiftly evaporated following a string of poor results, with even Amorim’s strongest supporters losing faith following last weekend’s damaging 3-1 loss to Brentford.",
      "READ: A full 20 reasons why Manchester United should sack Ruben Amorim",
      "In the summer, Man Utd overhauled their attack and signed a new goalkeeper, but they remain equally ineffective across the pitch, with Amorim’s go-to system not suited to this group of players or the club overall, and this won’t change.",
      "Despite this, Amorim had gone for the method of dying on his sword and has refused to change, saying before Saturday’s match against Sunderland: “I don’t think we’ve lost because of the system. That’s my opinion.”",
      "You somewhat have to admire Amorim’s bullish refusal to adapt in an attempt to save face (and boost his chances of falling on his feet elsewhere a la Vincent Kompnay), but this decision will be his undoing at Man Utd.",
      "And while Amorim’s disastrous reign has continued to descend, Postecoglou has returned to management by replacing Nuno Espirito Santo at Nottingham Forest.",
      "For Postecoglou, the attraction to Forest was clear as they are, undeservingly, in the Europa League and are striving for more under an ambitious (and batsh*t) owner.",
      "However, the decision from Forest to appoint Postecoglou was nonsensical, given that he and Nuno have polar opposite playing styles and that they are attempting to usher in this seismic change a few games into the new season rather than in the summer.",
      "Nuno also retains the support of Forest’s supporters, so Postecoglou to Forest was destined for disaster from the get-go, and it’s already falling apart, with home fans calling for his demise during the 3-2 loss against FC Midtjylland on Thursday.",
      "So Forest, like Man Utd, should soon be looking for a new manager and their search could begin as early as this month’s international break if this weekend goes awry.",
      "Then, a swap deal involving Amorim and Postecoglou obviously won’t be considered, but this would be a less daft route than Man Utd and Nottm Forest appointing their current managers in the first place.",
      "Put simply, this is because Forest, unlike Man Utd, actually has players ready-made for Amorim’s 3-4-3 system, while Postecoglou would immediately get brownie points at Old Trafford for using players in their natural positions in a 4-3-2-1 formation, which is perfect for this current Red Devils squad.",
      "I’m not saying that Amorim would excel at Nottm Forest and vice versa with Postecoglou at Man Utd, but the two managers and clubs would be better if they sanctioned this never-before-seen swap deal than they are at the moment.",
      "READ NEXT: Big Weekend: Chelsea v Liverpool, Tottenham, Postecoglou, Haaland, Kane",
      "Ruben Amorim ought to be a sack race shoo-in but Man Utd’s thriftiness and the worst start to a Forest reign in a century keeps him in Ange Postecoglou’s slipstream.",

      "Whether after a summer move or having simply failed to maintain form for the same club, these guys are all a worry.",
      "",
      "“Who doesn’t cause Konate problems right now?” Jamie Carragher asked having watched another one of the centre-back’s Liverpool performances directed by Mel Brooks, featuring the Laurel and Hardy theme. It was Victor Osimhen on Tuesday, Jean-Philippe Mateta last weekend and Joao Pedro will be champing at the bit on Saturday, assuming Slot doesn’t remove the opportunity for further farce by taking him out of the firing line.",
      "There are indeed rumours of a move to Real Madrid, and no progress on a new contract suggests he will move on a free transfer at the end of the season. But the way his head has been turned and seemingly removed entirely from his neck stands in stark contrast to Marc Guehi’s reaction to what was a transfer that actually very nearly happened.",
      "“The sun goes up, the sun comes down, life goes on,” the wonderfully sanguine Guehi said. What Slot wouldn’t give to have him over Konate right now.",
      "",
      "Very difficult for any Manchester United player who was around last season to experience a slump in form that doesn’t leave them as a boneless mess of offal on the Old Trafford turf, though human entrails may have been a more useful plug for the midfield hole than Manuel Ugarte has proved to be this term.",
      "Fortunately they spent £200m on a whole new forward line, and we could just as easily have plumped for either Matheus Cunha or Bryan Mbeumo here, who have scored a goal and claimed no assists in the Premier League in 846 minutes combined, but we must all at least concede that they are an improvement on whomever was operating in those inverted positions last season.",
      "That’s not the case with Sesko, though. He’s got one goal, and needed three bites at that before he scored against Brentford, and is doing excellent work to realise the Manchester United fear that they have replaced one inexperienced striker who crumbled under the pressure with another.",
      "Rasmus Hojlund starring for Napoli having escaped Old Trafford is one of a full 20 reasons United should sack Ruben Amorim.",
      "“He is not injured but in the tendon he has a difficulty,” Guardiola said when asked about Rodri’s absence against Burnley, before claiming he was taken off after an hour against Monaco for tactical reasons. ACL injuries are famously difficult to return from and easing him back into action is the way to go.",
      "But Nico Gonzalez replacing him on Wednesday before allowing Eric Dier a good sniff of his shin pad to concede a penalty in the dying moments, while simply a poor decision, will only add to the feeling that the £50m(?!) signing from Porto is not the Spain international’s long-term successor.",
      "Rodri should be in his prime at 29, but City’s metronome has lacked rhythm this season, and the apparent search for another No.6, just eight months after Gonzalez was recruited, which has seen Carlos Baleba, Adam Wharton and Elliot Anderson linked with a move to the Etihad, in itself raises huge questions as to whether Guardiola and the City bosses ever expect Rodri to return to his Ballon d’Or best.",

      "While we’re reticent to judge books by covers and refuse to sign up to the view that All Footballers Are Idiots, we can’t help but feel – entirely unfairly – after a start to his Liverpool career in which Kerkez doesn’t really look like he knows what he’s doing, that the 21-year-old may not be the fastest of learners.",
      "He’s the only Liverpool player to appear in all nine of their games this season, starting seven of them, and having got two goals and six assists in the Premier League for Bournemouth last season, he’s not got a sausage for the Reds, while ducking out of headers and providing nothing like the left-side solidity in defence next to Virgil van Dijk that Liverpool reaped the rewards in eight seasons of Andy Robertson.",
      "",
      "We loved watching Rogers last season, the goals and assists, but mainly because he’s not your typical No.10. He’s not renowned for delicate touches, a small turning circle or for having his head on a swivel in those tight spaces between midfield and defence.",
      "Of course, he can get on the half-turn and play defence-splitting passes, often as well as his namby-pamby counterparts in that position. But he also bullies his way through challenges, with his most memorable moments those in which he picks the ball up with no space in front of him and thinks ‘f*** it I’m just gonna run at the goal anyway’.",
      "But he always looked like a player – and he reminds of us Dele Alli in this way – that would really suffer when things aren’t quite right. The first touch is now worse than imperfect and therefore often unrecoverable, and while we’re not sure how Martin Keown expects Ezri Konsa to “lead” Rogers to improve his retention of possession, we don’t blame him for seeking answers to Rogers’ dramatic drop-off this season.",

      "We all extolled the virtues of 20-goal Chris Wood, 11-assist Anthony Elanga, the creative excellence of Morgan Gibbs-White, the rise of Elliot Anderson and the eye-catching displays of fellow centre-back Murillo last term. But in our eyes – and we suspect in Nuno Espirito Santo’s – 2024/2025 was the season of Milenkovic.",
      "And we can’t imagine a defender who quite clearly bloody loves defending has ever had a more enjoyable time than while playing under a manager who values that art at least as much as he does. We therefore wonder whether he’s had a less enjoyable time than he’s enduring right now under a manager who sees defending as the scourge of football and now faces the sack just three weeks into his reign with no wins and four defeats in six games.",

      "In search of The Problem with league-leaders Liverpool, short of calling out scapegoat-in-chief Konate, most fingers of blame are currently pointing in Wirtz’s direction.",
      "While fellow nine-figure summer signing Alexander Isak has so far avoided rebuke having not had the benefit of pre-season and starting just three games, much like Mikel Arteta manages Netflix FC, as we’re always waiting for the next Arsenal season for them to win anything, we’re at risk of giving up on a Wirtz series which promises plenty but is yet to feature an episode in which anything really happens.",

      "“What he has given us in recent seasons is nothing short of brilliant,” John McGinn said after Watkins broke his duck and Villa’s in their 3-1 win over Fulham last weekend, hoping the goal will “shut a few people up”.",
      "“When he gets the ball you expect that he will score,” McGinn added. But we put it to the Villa captain that that’s rarely been what people have thought when Watkins gets the ball, and definitely not now.",
      "He has the air of a man who’s been linked with a big move for two seasons and is coming to terms with the fact that that will now never happen for him. We’re apparently not among the few people to have shut up.",
      "",
      "It wasn’t all that long ago that Pep Guardiola had such centre-back riches that he had to play a couple of them at full-back, maybe one in midfield and leave at least one very fine one on the bench. It was sort of a toss-up then as to who would play in those central positions, but at that point because they were all excellent. Now it feels more as though they’re much of a mediocre muchness.",
      "Dias has always been held up as the best – of a very good bunch and now a not-so-good bunch. Having rivalled Virgil van Dijk for at least a couple of seasons at the Premier League pinnacle, we’re now not convinced he would make a top ten.",

      "Nine games into last season, Salah had six goals and five assists compared to three goals and three assists this term, but the eye test grants a far greater indication of his struggles. He looks nowhere near as vital, and we mean that both in terms of his energy and his importance to the team.",
      "Slot claims the way in which opposition sides are now looking to play against Liverpool is having an effect on Salah, whom he does admit is “out of form”, but he must be wondering – as we all are – just how big an impact the departure of Trent Alexander-Arnold and the arrival of Florian Wirtz, and him favouring the other side of Liverpool’s attack, is having on the Egyptian.",

      "The journalist added: “I think, ironically, I’m told, but some of the new players in particular are the most disillusioned because the pitch that they were given tactically, in football terms, hasn’t yet matched up to the reality, so that’s quite intriguing.",

      "There have been claims that Man Utd co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe wants to give Amorim the full season but Jacobs reckons he may be given 38 Premier League matches from when he first joined.",
      "Jacobs continued: “Ruben Amorim, I think, doesn’t have that many games to turn things around.",
      "“I’m not so sure, despite the fact that I respect other reports, that it’s as clear-cut as he’ll get a full season.",
      "“I think more likely, from speaking to people in and around the club, he’ll get 38 games split across two seasons and they’ll use that somewhat as a yardstick.”",
      "Gareth Southgate has been linked with taking over from Amorim, if Man Utd decide to sack him, but ex-Red Devils goalkeeper Ben Foster is unsure why the former England boss would want the role.",
      "Foster said on talkSPORT: “He’s got to be enjoying his life. Surely, for England, I don’t know why he would want to jump back into that frying pan, to be perfectly honest. Yeah, the answer for United, though, I honestly don’t know. I really don’t know.",
      "“I came on the show actually, I think it was probably about a month ago. I actually said maybe they do something like a Gareth Southgate. The only reason why I say that is because everything else just doesn’t seem to work.",

      "Jude Bellingham has been both AXED and DROPPED by England after Thomas Tuchel REFUSED an obvious request. Gareth Southgate has some shock Man Utd demands.",
      "As one of precious few individuals to manage the seemingly impossible feat of winning back-to-back games as a Premier League coach, Gareth Southgate is inevitably front and centre of any conversation surrounding Manchester United and Ruben Amorim.",
      "He really could be the next Manchester United manager. Probably not. But he could. And that is enough.",
      "The claim, however, is that he is hardly jumping at the chance. Southgate has his reservations, perhaps because it would be difficult to persuade Sir Jim Ratcliffe to spend £50m on Kieran Trippier.",
      "But someone in the Southgate camp has clearly been speaking to certain voices in the media, because…",
      "‘Southgate ‘lays out two demands’ to even consider Man Utd talks as pressure builds on Red Devils boss Amorim’ – Daily Mirror website.",
      "‘Gareth Southgate ‘insists on two Man Utd promises’ to replace Ruben Amorim if he’s sacked’ – Daily Star website.",
      "So what precisely is Southgate asking for? Only green M&Ms in his office? His initials emblazoned on a waistcoat? The suspense is killing us.",
      "‘Gareth Southgate would demand time and patience from Manchester United if he was to succeed Ruben Amorim.’",
      "Oh for fu…",
      "Come back to us when Gareth Southgate demands impatience and to be judged after a couple of games. Then you’ve got an actual story.",
      "",
      "‘More relevantly, the status quo from the United hierarchy has not changed. Amorim retains the backing of the United board and will do so until he is sacked.’",
      "Next week: Bruno Fernandes will remain captain until he is not.",
      "",
      "England squad announcement day offers brief respite from what has become an intensely competitive Premier League manager sack race.",
      "And it is absolutely, undeniably noteworthy that Jude Bellingham is not part of Thomas Tuchel’s selection.",
      "But a) he has not been ‘DROPPED’, and b) it is only really ‘a major shock’ if you have been paying no attention or are a tabloid journalist. In which case, Mediawatch offers its sincere condolences.",
      "John Cross writes that Bellingham ‘has been sensationally left out’ of the squad and Thomas Tuchel ‘has effectively admitted’ he was ‘DROPPED’.",
      "Well he wasn’t part of the last England squad due to injury, only made his return for Real Madrid after more than two months out following surgery on September 20, and has played precisely 100 minutes of football in his four appearances since.",
      "As Tuchel pointed out in a press conference, while Bellingham “wanted to be called up” he ultimately “lacked rhythm”.",
      "But does it really need to be explained why a player who has started one game for club and country in the last 86 days not being picked to potentially face Wales in a friendly or Latvia in a World Cup qualifier isn’t a particularly ‘massive surprise’?",
      "The ‘effective admittance’ from Tuchel was his quote asking the proverbial question: “Why not bring the same group in because they set the standards?” And, of course, not mentioning Bellingham or indeed any player specifically by name in his helpful clarification as to why Bellingham has been ‘DROPPED’.",
      "‘It also comes just two days after Bellingham was named as the England fans’ Player of the Year so this must be seen as a major shock,’ Cross adds, as if an award for performances last season bears any relevance whatsoever to a decision made based entirely on circumstances in October 2025.",
      "Bellingham not being picked is notable and interesting. But it is also completely explicable and understandable if given more than a moment’s thought.",
      "",
      "Bellingham had been both ‘AXED’ and ‘DROPPED’ according to the MailOnline, who say ‘Tuchel’s cryptic comments hint it’s INTENTIONAL’, as if he might have accidentally left him off the list initially.",
      "Tuchel also ‘REFUSED Jude Bellingham’s request,’ which is one way of interpreting a elite-level professional footballer predictably wanting to play football all the time and a manager making decisions based on more things than that one-eyed desire.",
      "The Mail are no doubt thrilled by Bellingham’s omission after laying into him throughout the last international break.",
      "And Craig Hope picks up where he left off with a lengthy opinion piece again calling out Bellingham’s ‘leading man syndrome’, ‘intimidatory manner’ and ‘ego’.",
      "‘Tuchel clearly feels a change of mindset is needed if they are to prosper together,’ he writes. Either that or Bellingham’s four appearances since returning from a quite significant surgery in the summer have totalled one minute, 19 minutes, 70 minutes and ten minutes respectively, and England have more than enough good players to not feel the need to take unnecessary risks over fitness and, as Tuchel said, “rhythm”.",
      "",
      "This line from Hope brings up a point worth reiterating far and wide considering some of the coverage Mediawatch has seen of the England squad announcement:",
      "‘[Tuchel] needs to know if [Bellingham] has listened. He needs to know the reaction after he branded the 22-year-old’s on-field demeanour ‘repulsive’ in June.’",
      "A couple of points.",
      "Tuchel didn’t ‘brand’ Bellingham’s ‘on-field demeanour ‘repulsive”. He said sometimes people on the outside “cannot see the nice and well-educated and well-behaved guy that I see and the smile. If he smiles, he wins everyone but sometimes you see the rage, the hunger and the fire and it comes out in a way that can be a bit repulsive. For example, for my mother when she sits in front of the TV.”",
      "And more importantly, Tuchel also apologised unreservedly for using that word “unintentionally”, adding: “I am experienced enough and should’ve known better, I should’ve done better. I thought I had a little more credit with you guys (the media) that I do all this in my second language.”",
      "Obviously not. We would apologise but it seems like they are completely ignored by the following month.",
      "",
      "And of course Henry Winter reckons Bellingham being left out is ‘baffling’. To be fair, everything must be confusing when you view life through the prism of the first half of Peter Beardsley’s debut season for Liverpool, 1987/88.",
      "Erling Haaland has been a Premier League player for barely three seasons but has already outscored a legion of legends and is firing Norway to the World Cup.",
      "Liverpool are officially in a ‘mini crisis’ which Arne Slot and two players in particular seems to be making worse. Chelsea and Enzo Maresca took advantage.",
      "Liverpool’s “mess” is worse than it initially seemed as this form of Arne Slot’s side have no chance of winning the Premier League title this season…",
      "Manchester United beat a thoroughly decent opponent and manager in a game of association football. It was ‘must-win’ and Ruben Amorim just…did.",
      "Arsenal will be praying for a potentially game-changing reprieve after Mikel Arteta’s new experiment against West Ham United confirmed a turning point…",
      "If Thomas Frank needs to make one change to his Spurs team, it’s in goal. Another mistake at Leeds surely means Guglielmo Vicario is for the chop."

      "\"Manchester United win the odd game but that's nowhere near enough. I don't think anybody would be kidded on by the fact that Manchester United beat Sunderland at home. The fact that it was even in doubt before the game is probably the problem in itself.\"",
      "Amorim said ahead of the game that he is convinced criticism from within the media is affecting his players and their confidence in his much-maligned 3-4-3 system. He said: \"My players, I guarantee you, they are listening to all the opinions and they are putting that inside because we are not winning games. They have to believe in me.

      "Manchester United made it three wins in a row at Old Trafford as they eased the pressure on Ruben Amorim with a 2-0 win over Sunderland.",
      "Mason Mount, selected ahead of Matheus Cunha, scored a fine opening goal before Benjamin Sesko netted at Old Trafford for the first time in front of his home supporters. Sunderland struggled to cope and even switched to 3-4-3 in a bid to alter the flow.",
      "There were flashes from Regis Le Bris' side that hinted at their confident start to the campaign, Bertrand Traore almost opening the scoring and Granit Xhaka firing off a shot. They also thought they had a penalty against Sesko but VAR rightly overruled it.",
      "Man Utd: Lammens (7), Shaw (6), De Ligt (7), Yoro (6), Dalot (7), Amad (7), Casemiro (6), Fernandes (7), Mount (8), Mbeumo (7), Sesko (8).\n\n\nSubs: Dorgu (6), Cunha (6), Mainoo (6), Ugarte (n/a), Maguire (n/a).\n\n\nSunderland: Roefs (7), Hume (5), Mukiele (6), Alderete (5), Masuaku (6), Xhaka (7), Sadiki (6), Le Fee (6), Traore (5), Adingra (6), Isidor (6).\n\n\nSubs: Ballard (6), Mayenda (5), Talbi (6), Brobbey (6), Geertruida (7).\n\n\nPlayer of the Match: Mason Mount.",
      "But United were the better side and could have punished the visitors even more but for Robin Roefs pulling off some good saves, including a fingertip effort to deny Bruno Fernandes. Senne Lammens, making his United debut, was less busy at the other end.",
      "Mason Mount's opener for Manchester United against Sunderland rounded off an 18-pass move, the joint-most for a goal in the Premier League this season.",
      "Lammens' best save came late in the game when he kept out a Chemsdine Talbi effort with his legs but the Belgian goalkeeper was hardly overworked. There were bigger cheers when he claimed a cross in stoppage time, his second good claim of the game.",
      "Manchester United kept their first clean sheet of the season in what was also Senne Lammens' debut for the club.",
      "How United need that sort of commanding presence in goal with supporters unconvinced by the performances of Altay Bayindir. Lammens, signed from Antwerp late in the window, also looked composed when kicking with his right and left foot.",
      "There was one hairy moment when he chased out of his goal on the angle only to see Traore get there first amid some uncertainty with Fernandes. But as debuts go, this was a fine effort from a 23-year-old goalkeeper with a huge task ahead of him.",
      "Manchester United head coach Ruben Amorim in the press conference:",
      "\"I think he looked confident in the first game. But the important thing is that the teammates helped Senne to have a good game. Because everyone was focused, not a lot of mistakes against a team that was really comfortable playing football.\"",
      "Asked why he delayed starting him, Amorim added: \"He arrives and you can feel it that he needs to adapt. New country, new training, the pressure that you guys put on the goalkeepers are massive. So it was like a little preparation for the guy to be ready to start his first game.",
      "\"But now it's just one game and he needs to work. Because he needs to be prepared that in our club things are really hard. But he did well in the game. He was comfortable during the game and that is a very good sign.\"",
      "Asked whether the international break denies United the opportunity to build momentum, Amorim joked that \"there is no momentum with our team\" - a reference to the fact that they are still looking for back-to-back Premier League wins under him.",
      "But Amorim was encouraged by the performance. When asked about Mount's comments that the players were 100 per cent behind their coach, the Portuguese suggested that the performance was proof of that.",
      "\"I saw it today. And I know they want to do the best and I know they don't want to change the coach all the time.",
      "\"We need to show with actions. Sometimes when we look at our team, I know for sure that when we see the games in the end I know sometimes we can do better. I feel it during the week but we need to show it on the pitch.\"",
      "It is easy to talk about heart, about shape, about defending with your lives - something which has provided the platform for some impressive results for Sunderland against Crystal Palace and Nottingham Forest. But resolve only gets you so far.",
      "At some point, you have to hurt teams and possess quality in the final third. And at Old Trafford, Sunderland looked woefully short in that department, creating just 0.71 worth of expected goals and rarely testing Lammens, who would have been feeling it ahead of his United debut.",
      "And while it's fair to say United were efficient rather than exceptional once racing into their 2-0, the gap in quality was undeniable. This was a bit of a reality check. A performance that strips back the optimism and lays bare the challenge ahead of survival.",

      "Ahead of Saturday's game at Old Trafford, read the full transcript as Amorim outlines his determination to turn Manchester United's form around, denies reports he is unhappy in Manchester, and argues that he used 4-4-2, rather than a back three, against Brentford.",
      "AMORIM: \"Because the worst thing in this job is to not win games. That is the same feeling I had in Casa Pia when I lost in the third division.",
      "\"And then it's a job. Of course, it's a dream to be here. And I want to continue here. And I want to fight for this. But the problem is now, what makes me suffer is to lose games, not to lose my job.",

      "\"That feeling sometimes hurts me a lot. Also the players and especially the staff here.",
      "\"But that is not my decision. And I think it would be really hard to leave if I don't do everything to follow my career here.\"",
      "AMORIM: \"It's really important because there is no one in the world that can read everything and listen to everything about people that understand football and not be influenced by that.",
      "\"So I'm trying to listen and to see all the games because I know that I see the game more times than all those guys together because they have to see all the games in the Premier League and give an opinion.",

      "\"There is no back three against Brentford. Lately we play with Luke Shaw, two centre-backs and the right back. They play in different positions in the beginning.",
      "\"So it's not three centre-backs, it's the same thing with a little bit different positions. Against Brentford, second half, it was like a 4-4-2. The problem is that we were not good with the ball, we were soft without the ball and we lose.",
      "\"But imagine that we score the penalty. In the final goal we are trying to win the game, everyone is out of position. That can happen in the 4-3-3 or the 3-4-3. So I think the details matter more than the system.\"",

      "Amorim fell to another sobering defeat as a rampant Brentford beat United 3-1 at the Gtech last weekend.",
      "It denied Amorim the chance to end a dismal record of failing to secure back-to-back league games in the same season since May 2024. United now sit in 14th, having lost three games this season, losing two and drawing one of their six fixtures, which has prompted huge concerns for Neville.",
      "\"I'm very worried,\" Neville told NBC, Sky's US partner, following the 3-1 defeat at Brentford. \"There's no point in me sitting here and saying that I'm not.",
      "\"The levels of performance, the results, the substitutions...[at Brentford], I saw something [which happened] at the end of the Grimsby game that they lost in the Carabao Cup a couple of weeks ago, which was Mason Mount ending up at left wing back.",
      "\"Now, look, we admire managers who are resilient, who are stubborn around the system. We want them to stick to the plan.",
      "\"But when you've got Mason Mount playing at left wing-back, you're going to look pretty stupid. And that's happened twice now. It can't happen. The first time I thought was unforgivable and it's happened again.",
      "\"He changes his back three and his back five every single game. And the performances and the results are just unacceptable. So I'm really, really worried.",
      "\"I would never go on television - I know how difficult a manager's job can be - and say that a manager should be sacked. But I suspect that the hierarchy at Manchester United are going to want to see a turnaround very quickly.\"",
      "Neville: \"When you've got Mason Mount playing at left wing-back, you're going to look pretty stupid.\"",
      "What the stats say: A manager's substitutions are meant to help a team, but Ruben Amorim's in-game changes at Manchester United have so far proven to be more of a hindrance. His Premier League substitutes have made more errors leading to goals than they have scored goals.",
      "That is as damning as stats come for a coach. The tally stands at 3-2 since he took charge nearly 11 months ago. In six games this season, two of Amorim's substitutes have made errors leading to a goal and none have scored off the bench.",
      "Neville: \"The results are just unacceptable.\"",
      "What the stats say: Results have been bad ever since Amorim arrived, so it is difficult to tell what it would take for the situation to become intolerable for the decision-makers at Old Trafford.",
      "Graham Potter was sacked by West Ham last weekend with a win percentage of 26.1 in the Premier League. Amorim's stands at 27.27 per cent after 33 games.",
      "For context, that is identical to Chris Wilder's record at Sheffield United in the top-flight after 66 games.",
      "Steve Bruce had a marginally better win rate when he was sacked by Newcastle, and so did Gary O'Neil at Wolves. This is the ballpark Amorim is in.",
      "Compared to coaches at 'Big Six' clubs since that moniker came into being in the early 2010s, Amorim has the worst Premier League record of those with at least 30 games. Juande Ramos was not much better at Spurs (28.6 per cent), but the 'Big Six' didn't exist then.",
      "Neville: \"He changes his back three and his back five every single game.\"",
      "What the stats say: Amorim has used 21 different back threes in his 33 Premier League games at United, which is by far and away the most of any other side in the competition during that timeframe. Southampton (13) and Wolves (10) are the closest behind.",
      "A change to the back three worked against Amorim last time out, with Harry Maguire starting in the back three for the first time in the league last season and playing a part in the first goal United conceded.",
      "Tinkering with his back line appears to be a consistent theme under Amorim. Leny Yoro, who started each of United's first four league games of the season, hasn't started since but has been introduced in the last two. Matthijs de Ligt and Luke Shaw have both started all of United's league games so far. However, Shaw has only completed 90 minutes in three of those games.",
      "The lack of consistency at the back of United has proved to be a reflection of their lack of consistency in both results and performances."

      "That was the sight of summer signings Benjamin Sesko, Matheus Cunha and Mbeumo starting a Premier League game together for the first time.",
      "United spent over £200m on their new attacking trio, and now the focus will be on seeing how quickly they can click to catapult the team up the table.",
      "\"It's exciting, because we get to learn to play with new players and it's always challenging, but that's what we like as footballers,\" Mbeumo said.",
      "\"Of course it will improve, we haven't played a lot together, so there are certain things that we're going to improve, and there are different types of players, but it's good to be with them.\"",

      "Tuesday 30 September 2025 17:00, UK",
      "PGMOL chief Howard Webb says it was \"good use of VAR\" to overturn Arsenal's 'penalty' at Newcastle and explains Nick Pope's challenge on Viktor Gyokeres was \"quite different\" to the foul committed by Chelsea's Robert Sanchez that saw him sent off a week prior.",
      "Magpies goalkeeper Pope eventually avoided conceding a penalty after he came out to challenge Gunners forward Gyokeres in the first half of Arsenal's 2-1 win at St James' Park. Running towards the ball in the Newcastle area, Pope rushed out to challenge Gyokeres, appearing to bring him down in the process.",
      "Referee Jarred Gillett initially gave a penalty for the challenge; however, VAR Darren England recommended an on-field review. After around three minutes, Gillett then announced the decision had been overturned.",
      "Bukayo Saka and Mikel Arteta were critical of the decision after the game. The pair questioned how it was deemed 'clear and obvious' to overturn the decision.",
      "REF: On-field decision is a penalty. Nick Pope, a trip by Nick Pope.",
      "VAR: OK, checking the on-field decision of penalty.",
      "VAR: Got a better angle?",
      "Replay Operator: Yeah, I've got a better angle from behind here.",
      "VAR: Does he get a touch on the ball, the goalkeeper? I think he gets a touch on the ball. Nick Pope gets a touch on the ball here.",
      "Assistant VAR: Yes, he does, yeah.",
      "VAR: Does he? One more time. He actually gets a touch on the ball, doesn't he?",
      "AVAR: Yeah, there's a secondary touch.",
      "VAR: Give me another angle, please. Just make sure that Pope touches the ball, please.",
      "Replay Operator: I've got an SSM (Super Slow Motion), but it's from the other side.",
      "VAR:  He does touch the ball, doesn't he? Touches the ball first, then there's contact afterwards. Therefore, that's not a penalty kick. He touches the ball there.",
      "Replay Operator: This is the best angle.",
      "AVAR: Have you got the behind view?",
      "Replay Operator: Yeah, this is the best angle I've got.",
      "VAR: He does, doesn't he? He touches. OK, let's just check the APP (Attacking Possession Phase) as it goes over as well.",
      "AVAR: It's definitely played by a defender. But check it anyway.",
      "VAR: Jarred, I'm going to recommend an on-field review for possible no penalty. Let me know when you've got the monitor. I am going to check APP as well. Nick Pope gets a touch on the ball.",
      "Replay Operator: I'll go slowly so you can check the APP.",
      "VAR: Yeah, yeah. It's his defender, a clear defender, isn't it? It's always clear defender, that's fine. The APP has been checked, the APP is clear as well. I'm going to show you the tight angle first with the ball being touched by Nick Pope. Any contact that happens thereafter, after the contact has been made.",
      "VAR: Nick Pope gets a touch with his right foot, I'll give you another angle on the touch.",
      "REF: Show me a better angle to see that he touches the ball.",
      "VAR: I will do, I'll show you a better angle.",
      "Replay Operator: Do you want the SSM from the other side?",
      "VAR: Yeah, yeah, yeah, super slow. Super slow, coming in now. Gets a touch on the ball there. And then just plants his foot in a normal action.",
      "REF: The attacker plays the ball first. I don't know if the goalkeeper actually plays the ball.",
      "VAR: The attacker plays the ball. Yeah, the attacker plays the ball, and the goalkeeper plays the ball then with his right foot, there.",
      "REF: Just play it at full speed, please.",
      "VAR: Any contact there, any contact after that is normal contact, because the goalkeeper just plays his foot.",
      "REF: Can you play it at full speed?",
      "VAR: Playing at normal speed for you.",
      "REF: So I'm seeing the goalkeeper get a toe to the ball first, prior to making contact.",
      "VAR: Agree.",
      "REF: So after a view, the goalkeeper plays the ball, there's no foul. Final decision, we drop ball.",
      "VAR: Confirmed.",
      "\"At full speed, it looks a penalty, doesn't it? And you can absolutely understand why the referee gave it from what he saw on the field.",
      "\"He gave it for a tripping action by Nick Pope. The VAR checks the penalty. Obviously, it's a reviewable situation, penalties, goals, etc.",
      "\"So he checks the penalty, makes sure that the decision is not clearly wrong. When he does that, he clearly sees that Gyokeres gets to the ball, pokes it a little bit forward, but then, importantly, Nick Pope also gets a very clear touch on the ball as he steps forward with that right foot and deviates the direction that the ball is going.",
      "\"And that hadn't been appreciated on the field by the referee. Pope then plants his foot on the ground. He doesn't drive it forward into Gyokeres.",
      "\"There's a gap, clearly a gap, between the two players after Pope has played the ball, and then the two players come together quite normally. The action by Pope is normal. It's not reckless. It's just a kick out towards the ball. The ball deviates.",
      "\"No contact on the player until the ball has been played away, and then the contact happens fairly normally. So, not a foul, and therefore a good use of the VAR to intervene to show the referee what really happened.",
      "\"The deviation's quite clear. You'll see that touch by Gyokeres, and you'll see Pope's right leg come in. It touches the ball, it moves the ball away in a different direction to the direction it was previously going in.",
      "\"When he then puts his foot on the ground, having made contact with the ball, there's a separation between him and Gyokeres. There's no contact at that point. The contact only happens after Pope has played the ball.",
      "\"So, it's a good challenge by Pope. It's not a foul, and there was an important part around this in that the referee didn't recognise that touch by Pope in real time.",
      "\"Hence the reason that when the VAR saw it, he deemed it to be a clear and obvious error because that touch by Pope hadn't been seen, and therefore the referee could go to the screen to look at that really important aspect and make a judgement for himself, and the judgement was: I've seen the touch, therefore it's not a foul, and I'm going to start with the drop ball.",
      "\"The referee hadn't recognised that touch, that was important, the VAR saw it and deemed it was a clear error. I agree with the VAR's intervention, so the referee can go to the screen, look at the full sequence, see that touch, see that there was a normal playing action by Pope and the penalty was rightly cancelled.\"",
      "A similar scenario happened during Manchester United's 2-1 win over Chelsea. Early on in the game, an onrushing Sanchez hacked down Bryan Mbeumo just outside the area and was subsequently sent off for denying a clear goalscoring opportunity.",
      "Webb's verdict:",
      "\"I know people have compared the two situations. I think they're really quite different, and we'll talk about why.",
      "\"I think the only similarity is that there is a touch on the ball from the goalkeeper in both situations, but the way that touch happens is quite different.",
      "\"Now, in this situation, Sanchez was sent off for denying Mbeumo an obvious goalscoring opportunity. He committed a foul, which prevented Mbeumo from continuing through to try to score.",
      "\"When you see the way that Sanchez comes out to try to play that ball, whereas we saw Pope play the ball low, his foot went straight to ground, and then there was a normal coming together.",
      "\"In this situation, he leads with a raised leg and stud showing, which goes into the leg of Mbeumo. It's at least a reckless action. Some people have talked about it, maybe even being more serious foul play, endangering the safety of the opponent.",
      "\"I think it's reckless, at least. It has to be penalised. There is that small touch on the ball, but that doesn't negate the fact you have to penalise this sort of action.",
      "\"And that touch, by the way, is quite different to the Pope one in that the ball doesn't really deviate, it just continues.",
      "\"It touches the top of the boot of Sanchez, and then continues in the same line with Mbeumo about to run onto it. In Pope's situation, we saw quite a deviation of that ball.",
      "\"So, for all of those reasons, this is absolutely something we have to penalise, primarily, though, because of the nature of the way that Sanchez went in, stood exposed on to the leg of Mbeumo.",
      "\"It has to be a foul. And then, of course, we know that the conditions are there for an obvious goalscoring opportunity.",
      "\"Mbeumo running on to that ball, the defenders are not there to cover. It's obviously a goalscoring opportunity. And therefore, the red card comes out for that reason.\"",
