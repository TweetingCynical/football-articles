      "Marcus Rashford has reportedly turned down a hugely lucrative offer from Saudi Arabia because he only has eyes for Barcelona. Rashford is in the wilderness in the summer transfer window, having been told he doesn’t feature in Ruben Amorim’s plans at Manchester United, but without an exit route lined up.",
      "Rashford has made it clear that he is keen to join Barcelona ever since concluding a long spell at Aston Villa. While his brief loan spell at Villa ended in injury, Rashford still managed to revitalise his career with four goals and six assists in 17 appearances.",
      "But things have moved slowly, largely due to the financial situation at play. Rashford is paid £325,000 per week at United, where he is under contract until June 2028, and Barca do not have the money available to match those terms.",
      "United would like to sell to whoever will match their £40million asking price, so will have been excited to hear of interest from the Saudi Pro League. However, Rashford has vetoed a move to the Middle East, according to Mundo Deportivo, who say he is waiting on Barca.",
      "The report says that Rashford was offered a deal worth €40m (£34m) by an unnamed Saudi side, but he dismissed it out of hand. His representatives have held talks with Barca and the England forward is said to be willing to lower his wages in order to achieve his dream move.",
      "The problem is that United want a permanent sale for their academy product and Barca would like to sign him on loan with the option to buy for £30m to £40m. If they accept a loan deal on the condition that Barca pay Rashford’s wages that would save them around £17m over a year.",
      "Rashford wants a move sorted as soon as possible, knowing that the Catalan giants begin their pre-season on July 24. Barcelona consider Rashford an alternative to Liverpool winger Luis Diaz, who has long been scouted by sporting director Deco.",
      "It comes after Barca failed in their pursuit of Nico Williams, who ended up signing a new 10-year contract with Athletic Bilbao after Barca said they were willing to trigger his €58m release clause.",
      "Rashford has been working on his fitness by himself, but has issued a clear plea to Barca. Speaking while on holiday in Marbella, he was asked by Spanish YouTube channel XBuyer whether he wants to play with Barca wonderkid Lamine Yamal in the future.",
      "\"Yeah, sure. Everybody in the world wants to play with the best,\" the forward replied. \"So hopefully, we'll see.\"",

      "Manchester United boss Ruben Amorim wants a deal for Bryan Mbeumo finalised before their pre-season tour of the US begins on July 22. The Red Devils have already had two bids rejected by Brentford, who want more than the £62.5million United paid for Matheus Cunha.",
      "And United are now in a race against time to sign Mbeumo before they leave for America later this month to play three games against West Ham, Bournemouth and Everton. Mbeumo has also been left frustrated by the situation, with negotiations dragging on.",
      "Mbeumo has made it clear that he wants to join United and Ashu Cyprian Besong, Cameroon's assistant coach, has revealed the forward is not happy with how things are going. \"Yes, obviously he's very frustrated with how long it's taken,\" Besong told Telecom Asia.",
      "\"But he's a professional and anticipates these things. I spoke to him about a week ago and he is very calm with everything that is going on. 'But of course, he's already told them he wants to go to United.",
      "\"He just wanted the two clubs to find an agreement, as he's very grateful for the opportunity that he's been given by Brentford in his career.\"",
      "However, Brentford have hinted that Mbeumo will remain at the club if their asking price is not met, with director of football Phil Giles telling BBC Sport last month: \"He had a fantastic season.",
      "\"We expected big interest in him, we have had big interest in him. He has his ideas about where he wants to take his career, of course he does – he is well within his rights to do that. We are in constant dialogue with him and representatives about that.",
      "\"As it stands at the minute we don't have an agreement in place for him to leave. It is not impossible he is still a Brentford player next season if we agree he is going to stay. It has to be the right deal for Brentford, any club will tell you that.",
      "\"If it's not right deal why would we do it? He is certainly one of our best players, if not our best player, and we need our best players. There's no harm in keeping your best players.\"",
      "Mbeumo enjoyed an outstanding campaign for Brentford last season, netting 20 Premier League goals in 38 appearances. Only Liverpool's Mohamed Salah, Newcastle star Alexander Isak and Manchester City striker Erling Haaland managed found the back of the net more times",

      "The Argentine also risked the wrath of the club as he slammed their 2024-25 season as \"s***\" after the Red Devils finished 15th in the Premier League, their worst season in top flight history.",
      "Garnacho is one of five players who were allowed extra time before returning to pre-season training in order to find new clubs, but he has since come back into the fold at Carrington among the first team squad.",
      "The 21-year-old is still intent on a move but has snubbed the opportunity to move to the Saudi Pro League with Al-Nassr, as reported by the Telegraph, because he wants to prioritise a European club.",
      "Napoli and Chelsea are among the teams who have been linked with a move for Garnacho in the past, with ESPN also claiming he has \"firm interest\" from teams in Germany.",
      "Joining Al-Nassr would have reunited Garnacho with Ronaldo, a player he idolised while the two were briefly at United together.",
      "Garnacho has previously been seen copying Ronaldo's trademark 'siiiuu' celebration on the pitch and the pair shared a close relationship during the Portuguese legend's two years back at United between 2021-22 and 2022-23.",
      "But it appears Garnacho is not ready to give up the chance of playing top level football in Europe, following the lead of United captain Bruno Fernandes - who snubbed interest from Al-Hilal because he wanted to continue with the elite for as long as possible.",
      "The Telegraph report goes on to say that United are still happy for Garnacho to pursue a move away from the club but are said to have placed a £60million price tag on him - which may put off some suitors.",
      "However, the Daily Express have claimed that some United figures have conceded they may have to settle for a bid closer to £45m in order to clear him off their books.",
      "Garnacho initially started his career in the Atletico Madrid academy before joining United's youth system in 2020, making his first senior appearance the following year. He has made a total of 144 appearances for United, scoring 26 times.",

      "Aston Villa have been watching their wallets in the transfer window so far, but a vital summer looms. Unai Emery's men will again play European football for the upcoming campaign.",
      "Wounds were licked on the last day of the past Premier League season when the Villans missed out on Champions League football and the funds that accompany it under cruel circumstances away to Manchester United.",
      "However, they will grace the Europa League for the upcoming term, and the club will have to prepare accordingly this summer. UEFA has thrown a slight spanner in the works, fining the club £9.5million for breaching financial rules and imposing a sporting sanction.",
      "Marco Asencio and Marcus Rashford's loan signings proved instrumental in Emery's side enjoying a stellar campaign last year. They’ll leave behind a gaping hole if not signed permanently, which at the moment looks unlikely.",
      "As per Gazzetta dello Sport, Asencio is reportedly being targeted by Inter Milan, Champions League finalists, and Rashford's potential PSR hit looks to be just out of the Villans' reach. So, attacking reinforcements may be top of the club's list when spending commences, with only youngster Zepiqueno Redmond signed so far, and a surprise target has emerged in the form of Barcelona's Ferran Torres.",
      "Reports in Spain suggest that the Catalan giants would be willing to accept a fee in the region of £43m for the 25-year-old former Manchester City winger. Former Villa scout Bryan King informed Villa News that Emery could also be key in forcing through a prospective deal.",
      "\"I think Emery will be a big factor,\" he stated. \"The promise of regular first-team football, working under a Spanish manager and Spanish coaching staff. Life at Villa would be quite enjoyable, I think, for Torres.\"",
      "In terms of exits, Emi Martinez is expected to leave Villa Park this window. The 32-year-old World Cup winner has been a goliath between the sticks for Villa, but Manchester United and Atletico Madrid have been mooted as likely destinations.",
      "Should Martinez, who left the Villans' final home game in tears last season in what looked like a goodbye, head out the exit door, then securing the signature of a competent replacement will be a priority.",
      "Chevalier is valued at around £40m and kept 11 clean sheets in Ligue 1 last season, the second most in the French top flight, as his side finished in fifth.",
      "One area where the Villans are not lacking is at left-back. Lucas Digne arrived from Everton in January 2022, and while at times he has looked sub-par, his set-piece abilities and pinpoint crosses can be lethal.",
      "Last summer, Ian Maatsen was brought in from Chelsea. He had spent the previous campaign on loan with Borussia Dortmund, where he made the Champions League final.",
      "Emery rotated both, favouring Digne, who seems to come alive in the face of competition, last season, but rumours suggest the French full-back could be leaving Villa Park in the coming months, with Atletico Madrid a potential suitor says The Times.",
      "The 31-year-old is in the final year of his current contract, and while he has been consistent for Villa, getting his wages off the books and receiving a fee for a player who may walk on a free next summer could be smart, considering that Maatsen is waiting in the wings.",
      "With Jhon Duran sold in January, Villa favourite Ollie Watkins led the line for most of the season and mustered 16 league goals, an impressive total despite being three less than he managed the previous term.",
      "Unlike Digne, he is contracted to Villa until 2028, but, having reached the age of 29 and with the likes of United sniffing around with big money to offer, he has been linked with a move away from the West Midlands.",
      "A fee of £60m has been bandied around, but the role that Watkins plays under Emery, not even taking into consideration his goal output, should render him relatively priceless. Watkins is a workaholic.",
      "While his finishing can leave a lot to be desired at times, the ground he covers not just through the centre but also out wide is vital to Villa's play. With no Rashford to force him onto the bench, he could string together some impressive performances next season in Europe and domestically, while replacing him with an unknown entity could hinder what is a vital campaign.",

      "Their north London rivals Tottenham have sealed the £55m arrival of Mohammed Kudus. And Manchester United are still yet to reach an agreement with Brentford for Bryan Mbeumo.",
      "With seven weeks left before deadline day, there's plenty of time to negotiate down asking prices. After all, you don't get if you don't ask.",
      "Where else can you start but with Arsenal's laughable £40m+£1 stunt. After hearing about a supposed release clause in Luis Suarez's Liverpool contract, the Gunners submitted an offer that was one Great British pound over the sum in order to activate it in 2013.",
      "They were left with egg on their face when it turned out that it only required a potential move to be merely discussed, and wasn't a fully-fledged release clause. The bid was therefore swiftly rejected.",
      "It was much to the humour of Reds owner John W. Henry, whose iconic tweet remains on the platform, now X, to this day: \"What do you think they're smoking over there at Emirates?\" Suarez, meanwhile, was convinced to commit to Anfield for another year by Steven Gerrard, before joining Barcelona in a £75m deal the following year.",
      "Doing business with one of your closest and fiercest rivals is never going to be straightforward, and there's often going to be an extra charge compared to if the player is being sold abroad. But Chelsea went the other way when they made a very cheeky attempt to sign Luka Modric from Spurs in 2011.",
      "They opened with a bid of £22m for Modric, who'd moved to White Hart Lane from Dinamo Zagreb for £16.6m three years earlier. His boss Harry Redknapp fumed: \"That is ridiculous. There are people being sold for £20m who are not fit to lace Luka's boots.\"",
      "Stamford Bridge chiefs did respond by upping their offer. But they were unable to hijack Real Madrid's move 12 months later, with the Croatian heading to the Spanish capital for around £30m – a sum that proved to be a steal.",
      "Clint Dempsey was coming off the season of his life in the summer of 2012 having scored 23 goals and registered seven assists in all competitions for Fulham. So you can forgive them for not rolling over when Liverpool came calling to the tune of just £3m.",
      "The Reds were very much in the midst of their banter era and their refusal to go any further than £4m once again left their rivals laughing at them. Although they did maybe dodge something of a bullet.",
      "Dempsey ultimately joined Spurs on deadline day for £6m. A return of 12 goals and seven assists was respectable enough, but he headed home to his native USA after just one season to join Seattle Sounders.",
      "Perhaps this should have been taken as a sign of things to come... United have been quite frankly tragic in the transfer market for over a decade, dating back to Sir Alex Ferguson's departure.",
      "When David Moyes took the reins, he was keen to bring with him some of Everton's most prized assets. His former club were in no mood to help him out when they received a £28m offer – for both Marouane Fellaini and Leighton Baines!",
      "\"Those bids were immediately rejected out of hand as derisory and insulting,\" a spokesperson for the Toffees slammed. It says it all about United's transfer nous that they then signed just Fellaini on deadline day for just £500k less than the joint bid.",
      "While all of the above have been intentionally insulting, Manchester City can be slightly excused here on the basis that they accidentally bid £30m for Lionel Messi. Although it does make it all the more embarrassing on their part.",
      "Former City executive Garry Cook explained the mix-up in ‘The Manchester City Years’ by Gary James. Sheikh Mansour had just completed his £210m takeover of the club in August 2009, with chiefs – located in Manchester, London and Abu Dhabi – scrambling to sign a forward before the window slammed shut.",
      "After failed swoops for Fernando Torres and Dimitar Berbatov, Cook explained: “He (an executive) made a comment like, ‘It’s all getting messy.’ Via the telephones and other communication lines, this somehow translated into, ‘Get Messi.’ An offer was made for Lionel Messi of about £30million. Needless to say, it was rejected.”",
      "Cherry picking a relegated club's top talent is always a fun exercise for the Premier League's big boys, who know full well the selling club are bent over a barrel. But there's still a line – and Spurs well and truly crossed that two years ago.",
      "Leicester City had one of the most stacked squads a relegated Premier League team has ever seen, and James Maddison and Harvey Barnes were both destined for big moves. £50m for both of them, however, was never going to fly.",
      "Maddison did end up signing on the ever-shameless Daniel Levy's dotted line, but he cost £40m alone, while Newcastle signed Barnes for £38m. Hey, you were nearly two thirds of the way there lads.",

      "However the club underlined that Eze not being selected was unrelated to any potential move away, instead he had not began his pre-season yet and has been allowed an extended break. England last played on June 10 with Eze starting in attack as the Three Lions were stunned by Senegal.",
      "Liverpool are prepared to enter the race for Rodrygo, whose Real Madrid future appears incredibly uncertain, with Arsenal heavily linked with the Brazilian. The forward's game time has massively decreased and he has lost his starting spot over the summer.",
      "Arsenal want to bolster their forward line, but are closing in on the signing of Noni Madueke from Chelsea. It remains to be seen whether that would see their interest in Rodrygo cool, which could open the door for Liverpool if they needed to fill a hole in their squad.",

      "And when asked if Barcelona's plans included the option of signing Rashford, or Liverpool forward Diaz, he added: \"We have been focusing on renewing contracts, after that, we'll discuss players to come.",
      "\"Of course, these two players, like you mentioned, they are good but have contracts in their clubs, so we won't speak because it's not fair. But when you decide to go to the market, for sure, we find some names. In my opinion, we don't need to bring many players.\"",
      "Deco continued: \"When I speak with the agents of the players, everyone wants to come or stay. So this is important. The image of the club is still good. We are proud because Barcelona is still such a big club, and the way we are playing football makes players want to come.\"",
      "In the meantime, Rashford has returned to Carrington to train on his own in the afternoons, despite the club granting extra time to the players who want to explore a departure.",
      "Rashford is also without a squad shirt number after United decided to give the No.10 shirt to new signing Matheus Cunha. Some fans believe that was disrespectful, and others just want to see Rashford out the door.",
      "Regardless of those different opinions splitting the fanbase, it's sad to see the most successful United academy graduate of recent times end his time at his boyhood club on a sour note.",
      "Rashford will hope for a move to Barcelona to turn a negative situation into a positive, but Liverpool could have an influence this summer and essentially hurt United in the transfer window."

      "Manchester United have enjoyed a week of training in tropical conditions at Carrington.",
      "Hot weather has swept across the United Kingdom as Ruben Amorim prepares his players for their opening pre-season friendly of the summer against Leeds in Stockholm on July 19.",
      "All of the squad have now reported back to Carrington, with the exception of those who wish to explore a move away this summer, and spirits seemed high in the training footage released by club media.",
      "So here are five things we spotted in training at Carrington...",
      "Altay Bayindir, Casemiro, Diogo Dalot, Patrick Dorgu, Bruno Fernandes, Manuel Ugarte, Rasmus Hojlund and Chido Obi all reported back to Carrington for pre-season on Thursday morning.",
      "The players who were on international duty at the end of last season were given extra time to enjoy a break.",
      "The 'welcome back tunnel' has become a tradition for players who return from injury at Carrington, but it was rolled out for those who returned from international duty on a sun-kissed pitch.",
      "Hojlund spectacularly regressed last season, scoring just four goals in the Premier League, and a move to Italian club Inter Milan could be on the cards in the summer transfer window.",
      "It feels more likely that Hojlund will stay and fight for a starting place, though. The 22-year-old recently played down suggestions he could leave United when he spoke to Danish media and his finishing must improve if he stays.",
      "Perhaps that's why United included footage of Hojlund finding the back of the net on three successive occasions in a training drill, with the striker blasting past Radek Vitek.",
      "Earlier this month, new signing Diego Leon promised he would \"kill it\" in pre-season to impress Amorim.",

      "Since moving to Botafogo in January 2024, John has managed to become a regular for the Brazilian club.",

      "Speaking to L'Equipe, the Swede said:",
      "Maybe [I will leave]. That’s football, you never know. I don’t think about it; we’ll see what happens. If something happens, it will. The most important thing for me is to play for a club that really wants me. It’s one of the biggest leagues (Premier League) in Europe. I spent several years there without being able to play a single match. So, of course, it’s something I’d like to do. It would be great revenge.",
      "According to the Daily Telegraph, Garnacho has rejected the chance to sign permanently for Al Nassr this summer.",
      "It is believed that Ronaldo's team tried to persuade the Argentine to join them for their Saudi Pro League title pursuit.",
      "However, Garnacho's aim is to stay in the Premier League and is unwilling to move to the Middle East at this stage.",
      "There is a clear reason behind that, and it all stems from the valuation Sporting have for Gyokeres.",
      "The Swede was under the impression that should a bid of £52m plus £8.67m in add-ons was to be submitted, he would be allowed to leave the Lisbon club.",
      "While Varandas agrees that holding out for his £85m release clause would not be possible, he is also unwilling to let the striker leave for that little.",
      "It is believed that Sporting's asking price is £60.67m plus £8.67m in add-ons and, as of yet, no club has reached that valuation.",
      "In the latest twist in the Gyokeres saga, the striker has been issued with disciplinary action from Sporting after failing to arrive for pre-season training.",
      "Sporting president Frederico Varandas sent a clear message to the striker on Saturday:",
      "We're calm. Everything can be solved with the closure of the market, a hefty fine and an apology to the group. If they don't want to pay Viktor's fair market value, we'll be very comfortable with that for the next three years. If the geniuses who are devising this strategy think that this puts pressure on me to make it easier for him to leave, not only are they completely wrong, but they are also making it more complicated for the player to leave. No one is above the interests of the club. Whoever they are.",

      "My name is Jack Flintham and I shall be keeping you across the latest United news throughout the morning.",

      "Ollie Watkins has been linked with a summer move to Manchester United. Ruben Amorim's side are in the market for a new No.9 and the Aston Villa forward is among those on the club's shortlist.",
      "Watkins, 29, signed for Villa in a £33million deal from Brentford in September 2020. Since then, the 18-time England international has cemented himself as one of the top strikers in the Premier League. He has scored 87 goals and provided 42 assists in 223 appearances during his time at Villa Park.",
      "However, Watkins could leave Villa this summer after growing frustrated with his game time last season. He was left \"fuming\" after Marcus Rashford took his place up front for some important matches in April, including the two-legged Champions League quarter-final against Paris Saint-Germain.",
      "This followed a spell earlier in the season where Jhon Duran was preferred as the lone centre forward. But Watkins did regain his spot after Duran was sold to Al-Nassr in January for around £65m.",
      "United are among those interested in a move for Watkins and their pursuit of the former Exeter City man could be boosted as Villa eye a blockbuster deal for Porto hitman Samu Aghehowa.",
      "According to Portuguese outlet A Bola, Porto are considering selling Aghehowa after just one season. The 21-year-old signed for the Primeira Liga outfit in a permanent move from Atletico Madrid last summer.",
      "But, despite netting 27 goals in 45 games for Porto in 2024/25, Francesco Farioli's side are weighing up cashing in on Aghehowa and making a considerable profit on the £23.3m they paid to sign him.",
      "It's added that Villa have expressed an interest in signing Aghehowa and have identified the Spaniard as a possible replacement for Watkins. Porto value Melilla-born Aghehowa at £69m.",
      "Aghehowa scored twice against United in the Europa League last October and he could do serious damage in the Premier League. Only Sporting CP's Viktor Gyokeres (39), who has been linked with a move to United this summer, netted more in Portugal's top tier than Aghehowa (19) last season.",
      "Indeed, should Villa opt to sign Aghehowa, Watkins could therefore be allowed to leave, opening up a potential move to United. Amorim's side want a new No.9 and the Villa forward could be the perfect man to strengthen their attack, having scored 17 goals and added 14 assists in 54 games last term."

      "In two seasons in Portugal, the 27-year-old has scored 97 goals in 102 appearances. However, United haven't been alone in the race to sign him and it now looks like Arsenal will bolster their centre-forward ranks.",

      "Since Manchester United lost the Europa League final to Tottenham on May 21, talk has materialised day-by-day calling for a desperate overhaul of the playing squad.",
      "Ruben Amorim's first 'phase' at Old Trafford has been faced with countless problems ranging from player fall-out, disappointing results and now a lack of some much-needed transfer business.",
      "So far, United have bought just Matheus Cunha. The Brazilian's £62.5million release clause was triggered at the start of June and he's already been introduced to his teammates at Carrington. But, despite Amorim admitting a number of times that his team requires attention, United have not yet acted.",
      "Their interest in Bryan Mbeumo has been ongoing for well over a month now with two bids turned down by Brentford. Any hope that the 25-year-old would be part of United's pre-season squad have rapidly dwindled and the apparent lack of a third offer has cast doubts over an actual deal happening.",
      "Whilst the main focus for Jason Wilcox and the recruitment team at United is to sign Mbeumo sooner rather than later, the Reds have other positions that need strengthening. One of them areas at centre-forward with United expected to sign a striker with better goalscoring prowess than Rasmus Hojlund.",
      "However, a new midfielder has also been tipped to come in. Amorin's dream front three of Mbeumo, Cunha and a striker means Bruno Fernandes is expected to be play in one of the two central midfielder spots. One issue Amorim has, though, is that there isn't an obvious candidate to partner him.",
      "Manuel Ugarte and Casemiro both featured heavily for United last term with Kobbie Mainoo's season being stagnated by injuries. The likes of Ederson, Wilfried Ndidi and Douglas Luiz have all been linked with coming to the club but Palmeiras' Richard Rios is a name that doesn't seem to be fading from United's catalogue of reported transfer targets.",
      "Rios has flourished at the Brazilian outfit and is one of the many players to come away from the Club World Cup with a glowing reputation. The box-to-box midfielder has been mentioned for a couple of weeks now but reports in Italy have suggested that United have finally entered the race.",
      "Gazzetta dello Sport has claimed that the Reds have stepped up their interest in the 25-year-old and have taken 'concrete steps' towards signing him. Roma have recently failed with a £22m bid for the Colombian, falling short of Palmeiras' £26m asking price.",
      "It leaves the door open for United to swoop in and add him to Amorim's squad. Many may question the Reds' need for a midfielder of Rios' profile but having an energetic character alongside a technician and creator like Fernandes could be a perfect piece of United's puzzle.",
      "Heavy emphasis is on the two wing-backs in Amorim's system. Getting Patrick Dorgu and Diogo Dalot, or Amad, wide and forward is pivotal to United gaining success. The problem they've had at times is that the lack of energy and connection in the middle of the park has left them short when wing-backs go forward.",
      "Rios' arrival wouldn't guarantee an immediate starting place at Old Trafford. However, there is reason for the energetic and combative midfielder to be signed. Not only would he add the liveliness required to free Fernandes to pull the string in the final third, but he would provide the defensive stability to allow the wing-backs to stretch the pitch and cause havoc out wide."

      "Altay Bayindir is expected to take his spot in Ruben Amorim's starting XI during pre-season but the Turkey international's future at the club has been in doubt. It's believed that the goalkeeper's agent has been at Carrington this week to discuss the £4.3million signing's future at the club.",
      "With Onana's injury and the prospect of Bayindir leaving the club in search of first-team football, United are considering a move for a new goalkeeper - to replace Onana as first-choice or Bayindir as the back-up.",
      "United are also in the market for other players and their budget not being at the level of their rivals, players like John Victor from Botafogo have been linked with a move to Manchester. Goal Brazil has reported that United are now ready to sign the Brazilian for his £6million release clause after his Club World Cup performances.",
      "However, Emiliano Martinez continues to be heavily tipped to become United's brand new number one. Talks to sign the Aston Villa shot-stopper have already been held with Martinez said to be open to a move to Old Trafford.",
      "His £40m asking price has meant any potential move is yet to be made but the 32-year-old continues to be linked with the club. Martinez's name could be a one that United re-consider in the coming weeks after Aston Villa moved closer to finalising an agreement for a new goalkeeper of their own.",
      "The Athletic has reported that Brest's Marco Bizot is expected to move to Villa Park this summer for a low-cost fee. He's anticipated to come in as the club's No.2 but uncertainty over Martinez's future means Unai Emery now has a short-term fix.",
      "BBC Sport has reported that Bizot is set to arrive to the United Kingdom soon and complete his move to the Premier League side. Personal terms are thought to be a 'formality' meaning a deal could be close to completion.",

The Mirror reported on Sunday that United are interested in signing another goalkeeper this summer with Botafogo's John thought to be high on their shortlist.",
      "If he was to arrive, Bayindir's position at Old Trafford would start to look even more uncertain. MEN Sport understands Onana has received reassurances from the United backroom staff that he remains part of the plans and Tom Heaton signed a new contract to be third choice.",
      "As such, The Mirror reports that Bayindir's agent Sefa Seyrek has flown to Manchester to discuss his client's position at the club. It is believed that the 27-year-old fended off interest from Europe for his signature in January as he did not want to leave.",
      "In recent weeks, that interest has resurfaced again and Bayindir could, this time, welcome such an approach."

      "Despite making a flying start to this summer's window, announcing they had reached an agreement to sign Matheus Cunha 14 hours after it opened on June 1, progress has been slow at Old Trafford.",
      "United have become bogged down in negotiations with Brentford over signing Bryan Mbeumo, meaning other objectives they want to try and complete this summer are yet to be properly explored.",
      "The Reds have prioritised strengthening their attacking options after recording a negative goal difference for the second Premier League campaign running last term and the decision to commit £62.5million to the signing of Cunha has been applauded.",
      "He scored 17 goals last season, meaning he will add a much-needed goal threat to United's attack. The club remains hopeful Mbeumo, who scored 20 Premier League goals in 2024/25, will soon join the Brazilian at Old Trafford.",
      "However, United need to do more in the attacking department before the start of the season than just sign Mbeumo. With that said, MEN Sport has had a look at what deals United need to complete to revamp their forward line ahead of the big kick off.",
      "As already documented, United are still striving to reach an agreement with Brentford to sign Mbeumo. The 25-year-old has been the subject of two offers from the Reds and the second - understood to be in excess of £60m - looked as though it would be enough.",
      "Both United and Mbeumo are equally keen to get the deal done. The attacker informed Brentford at the beginning of June that he wants to move to M16.",
      "It is widely believed United want to sign Mbeumo to install him as their right-sided No.10. Cunha is expected to operate as the left-sided No.10, meaning United are looking to give their attack a completely new look.",
      "That, of course, is because the club remains determined to sign an out-and-out centre-forward. United need to invest in a reliable goalscorer this summer and the prospect of ending the summer without having recruited one could prove to be very costly.",
      "Liam Delap was identified as United's primary striker target ahead of the start of the summer amid his £30m release clause at Ipswich Town, but he was snapped up by Chelsea. He held talks with United and other Premier League clubs before moving to Stamford Bridge.",
      "Although missing out on Delap was not as big a blow as some suggested given he only has one full season of top flight football under his belt, it has had an impact on United's search for a No.9. They have been linked with the likes of Viktor Gyokeres, Victor Osimhen and several others, but they are not believed to have tabled a concrete offer for a goalscorer yet.",
      "The problem United are facing, of course, is that they need to sell players to bring in new faces, and that has so far been easier said than done.",
      "Missing out on Champions League qualification for 2025/26 has significantly reduced United's revenue streams, meaning they need to be smart this summer.",
      "Having already spent £62.5m on Cunha and being prepared to spend possibly a little bit more on Mbeumo, United need to make their presence felt in the seller's market. Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho and Antony were identified as priority sales in May, while Alejandro Garnacho was informed he will be allowed to leave at the right price.",
      "The quartet, alongside defender Tyrell Malacia, informed United last week they want to leave the club this summer to explore different opportunities, meaning both the players and the club are aligned in the direction they want to head in.",
      "United value Rashford at £40m, Antony is available at £32.58m and Sancho is on offer for somewhere in the region of £20m-£25m. Garnacho is valued at north of £50m.",
      "If United can command the aforementioned prices for those four players and get them off the books, it would go a long way towards boosting their chances of overseeing more incomings, both in attack and elsewhere in the squad.",

      "They have got to be smart this summer and that is the balancing act they are currently facing. United know just how desperate both the fans and Amorim are for new signings, but they can't lose sight of the finances despite that increasing hunger."

      "Mason Mount and Matheus Cunha won't have played together before, but the duo appear to be bonding and getting on well during Manchester United's first week of pre-season.",
      "Most of Ruben Amorim's squad returned Carrington on Tuesday to begin training for the 2025/26 season, while the rest - all of whom were involved in international matches in June - were back on Thursday.",
      "Mount and Cunha, who made the £62.5million move from Wolves last month, were among those to have returned first and the pair seem to be forming a friendship, despite only training together for a couple of days.",
      "In fact, Mount posted an Instagram story of him and Cunha standing side-by-side during a training session earlier this week. Alongside that image, the ex-Chelsea man included the heart hands emoji and face exhaling emoji.",
      "Should Mount and Cunha continue to bond, that could be a partnership that Amorim decides to use on a more frequent basis - and it could in fact unlock Rasmus Hojlund to get more opportunities in front of goal.",
      "Mount joined the Reds in a £60m deal from Chelsea in 2023 but hasn't set the world alight, with the midfielder struggling with form and injuries. In fact, he started just six Premier League matches in 2024/25. He missed a sizeable chunk of the season after suffering two muscle injuries and was never able to get a consistent run in the XI.",
      "When Mount is at his best, he can cause a real problem for opposition defences, there is no doubt about it. He can drift in between the midfield and the front line and feed passes through to United's forward players. As well as that, Mount has the potential to nick a goal or two here or there.",
      "Amorim appears to like Mount and sees him as an important part of his United squad this season. Whether that is as a No.10 or a No.8, Mount can help unlock the best of Hojlund with his high creative potential.",
      "The same, however, can be said about Cunha. The Brazilian created 57 chances in the Premier League last season - the 15th-highest in the division - and he has the potential to conjure up even more next term.",
      "When both Mount and Cunha link-up, there is a high chance that either of them are going to create chances for their teammates to score. Having both of them on the pitch at the same time is no doubt going to boost Hojlund - and even Zirkzee - and his opportunities to score on a more regular basis."

      "“There is interest in Sporting’s Martin Hjulmand, Bayern Munich’s Joao Palhinha and Palmeiras’ Richard Rios. As almost goes without saying, they of course need to sell first.",
      "“Bayern may be in the same situation, however, which is what makes the Palhinha interest intriguing. The lamentable injury to Jamal Musiala means they have to go back into the market, and that could create a few openings.”",

      "United have also been linked with a host of new strikers despite Rasmus Hojlund’s desire to stay at Old Trafford this summer, and still have the faintest glimmer of hope of signing Viktor Osimhen from Napoli after Romano revealed Galatasaray have had a €70m bid rejected for the Nigerian.",
      "He tweeted: ‘EXCL: Galatasaray submit new proposal to Napoli for Victor Osimhen after €70m rejected! The Turkish club now offers €75m with €40m immediate payment and €35m in installments, with bank guarantees as key point again. Decision up to Napoli once again.’",
      "The transfer guru did though claim on Thursday that both the fee for Osimhen and the striker’s wage demands make a United move unlikely.",

      "“I am not aware of Manchester United entering into this one not just for the 75 million euros but also because of the salary.",
      "“The real point between Premier League clubs last summer and this summer has always been about the salary.",

      "Very good chance we’re projecting a little bit here, but if there were a theme to this summer’s Premier League transfer business thus far it would be Okay, You’ve Had Your Fun.",
      "Everyone enjoyed themselves, didn’t they, watching unlikely and less familiar teams compete for European spots? And everyone really enjoyed watching Tottenham and Manchester United be astonishing levels of sh*t for astonishing periods of time, right up until Spurs somehow unSpursed themselves at the best/worst possible moment.",
      "But we get the impression now that it’s not just Spurs and United themselves spooked by last season’s ineptitude. Some of the other big clubs might have been hit by the realisation that this could happen to them if the Premier League’s middle-class weren’t brought to heel.",
      "Let’s not pretend that the biggest clubs buying the best players from the other clubs in the league is a brand new phenomenon, but we’re not even at the middle of July yet and the heart has been ripped out of several of the upstarts who made last season so different.",
      "And it’s the big clubs doing that ripping. Four of the traditional Big Six are currently Europe’s four biggest spenders this summer, and all of them have moved to take some of the best players from elsewhere.",
      "Liverpool have Milos Kerkez. Chelsea have Joao Pedro. Tottenham have Mohammed Kudus, even if they have managed to Spurs their pursuit of Morgan Gibbs-White up. Man City have got themselves a Rayat Ait-Nouri.",
      "Arsenal will be very much in the top five once they and Sporting stop their absurd game of chicken and just get a deal done for Viktor Gyokeres as we all know they eventually will once everyone can agree a way to proceed that allows everyone to feel like they’ve won. They’ve also got themselves a Christian Norgaard to continue the theme anyway.",
      "Man United sneak into the top 10 as well after signing Wolves lunatic Matheus Cunha, and again the only reason they’re not higher is because Sir Jim Ratcliffe hasn’t yet decided precisely which and how many unimportant disposable meatbags he needs to sack to scrape together enough coppers to get himself a Bryan Mbeumo.",
      "Is it too early to officially Fear for Brentford? We really think it might not be. They must have known the day would come that Thomas Frank tried his luck at somewhere bigger and also probably stupider, and he will certainly be doing those things.",
      "One of the most interesting things we thought we might learn next season was just how good Frank is, and that this would involve not just what he did at Spurs but what Brentford did in his absence. How much of Brentford’s success has been down to him personally? How able is he to replicate that in a very, very different environment?",
      "But Brentford appear to be about to take on that challenge in even more extreme circumstances than anyone could have imagined. They approach the dizzying uncertainty of life without their inspirational manager – and several members of his backroom staff – also without Norgaard, who did so much to make them tick, as well as almost certainly Mbeumo and quite possibly Yoane Wissa.",
      "And promoting a manager from within represents an admirable but enormous gamble. The desire for some continuity may be understandable, but when you don’t have continuity of players we do wonder how prudent a move that actually is.",
      "The good news for Brentford is that they are far from alone. Wolves have lost Cunha and Ait-Nouri. Brighton have lost Pedro. Forest are about to lose Anthony Elanga and Gibbs-White. Bournemouth have lost Kerkez and Dean Huijsen – even Real Madrid are helping out their big-club mates – while Palace will surely be stripped of some combination of Marc Guehi, Eberechi Eze, Adam Wharton and very likely the Europa League.",
      "West Ham’s situation is slightly different, with the sanctioning of Kudus’ sale even to the worst possible place very likely a pretty smart, hard-headed decision to generate significant funds for their squad rebuild by offloading a player who doesn’t quite fit with the new manager’s plans. But it’s still another chastening reminder of how the land lies.",
      "These clubs have all trod this path before and at least some of them will be absolutely fine and possibly even improve for smartly reinvesting that cash in new, cheaper players who go on to become the next big-money signings for the larger beasts.",
      "Last season’s upsetting of the Premier League applecart came about in large part because the money sloshing around the Premier League is such that even the division’s proletariat now find themselves with spending power to outgun pretty much anyone outside the superclubs anywhere else.",
      "But right now it’s an uncomfortable time for a lot of the Premier League’s middle-class as the old order seeks to re-establish itself at their enormous expense."

      "Marcus Rashford’s dream move to Barcelona may never materialise as the Spanish giants have reportedly selected an alternative, Ademola Lookman.",
      "Rashford’s time at Manchester United is realistically over, but both he and the club are struggling to find an exit route.",
      "The 27-year-old spent half of last season on loan at Aston Villa but has made it clear that he favours a move to Barcelona, with the Catalan club looking to strengthen their attacking depth.",
      "Initially, it looked as if Rashford’s move would not come to be with Barceloan going all out to sign Nico Williams, only for the 22-year-old to go sign a ten-year deal with Athletic Bilbao.",
      "Rashford then would have been hopeful about his chances, but a report from Spain suggests Barcelona are going after an alternative, former Everton winger Lookman.",
      "Sport, a newspaper based in Barcelona, says head coach Hansi Flick ‘likes’ the 27-year-old and that he could be available for less than €50 million.",
      "“The Blaugrana have other options on the table, such as Rafa Leao, and are also reportedly keeping a close eye on the situation of Atalanta star Ademola Lookman,” journalist Lluis Miguelsanz said. “He’s a player Flick likes, but his situation isn’t encouraging because relations with his entourage are currently strained.",
      "“Lookman has been trying for years to make the big leap from Atalanta to a top-flight Champions League club, but so far no one has taken the step to sign him.",
      "“The Italian club took a chance by signing him from Leipzig for €10 million, and he’s exploded onto the scene. He’s been gaining international prominence and is now a more mature player, although he needs to take a definitive step to establish himself at the elite level, as his performance is still very inconsistent.",
      "“He’s a pure winger, fast and capable of scoring goals. And he can play in all attacking positions, something Barça highly valued in Luis Díaz, the leading candidate to fill that position if financially possible. Atalanta would be willing to negotiate his sale for less than €50 million because his contract expires in 2027 and he hasn’t renewed yet, and Tottenham are strongly interested in signing him.”",
      "One stumbling block, though, could be Lookman’s choice of agency and their involvement with an ongoing issue at Barcelona.",
      "“The major handicap is that Lookman shares a representation agency with Marc-André ter Stegen, and problems with the goalkeeper are brewing.",
      "“The German will push hard to stay at Barça, and this could create an awkward situation for all parties, which could significantly impact relations with Lookman’s entourage. For now, Barça only has information about his situation, like that of many wingers, but nothing has been done about it.”",
      "Meanwhile, transfer reporter Fabrizio Romano says Rashford is “very open” to the Barcelona move and is “basically waiting for Barca.”",
      "“Marcus Rashford would be very keen on a move to Barcelona. Marcus Rashford is very open to that opportunity. I always told you since January and I keep repeating that Rashford would love Barca move and he’s basically waiting for Barca move because he has many opportunities.",
      "“Rashford is losing the number 10. He was informed 24 hours before about that, through his agents of course, but let me say that it’s not just Marcus Rashford desire to leave Manchester United.",
      "“All of this also starts from Manchester United desire to part ways from Marcus Rashford since January and continuing this summer. So it’s not only Rashford who wants to leave United but there is also United who are pushing the opportunity to sell Marcus Rashford or to find a solution for him this summer.",
      "“When I say Man United it’s the management, it’s the coach Ruben Amorim. So all parties are going to the same direction for Marcus Rashford to leave.”",

      "20) 🆕 Khvicha Kvaratskhelia – PSG to Liverpool\nThe story goes that Liverpool will ‘consider’ a move for Kvaratskhelia if they receive a ‘substantially’ better offer from Barca or Bayern for Luis Diaz, who they see as ‘a more proven player’ than the Georgian star, who only joined PSG in January before winning the lot. We know we ought to be more mature and offer a more considered response, but all we’ve got is: Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.",
      "",
      "19) 🔽 Benjamin Sesko – RB Leipzig to Arsenal\nArsenal, finally, appear to have chosen a lane, one that takes them to Gyokeres’ door. We would never rule out a sharp U-turn, but Sesko’s hopes of joining Arsenal this summer have never seemed as slim as they appear right now.",

      "18) Jadon Sancho – Manchester United to Juventus\nDespite speculation that Juve preferred a permanent move for Francisco Conceicao, many reports suggest a deal has been agreed with United and it’s now down to Sancho to decide if how much he might be prepared to sacrifice to kickstart his career. The signs so far: not much…",
      "",
      "17) 🔼 Dusan Vlahovic – Juventus to Manchester United\nJuve’s problem here is similar to United’s with Sancho: they owe the player another year of a huge salary. But Vlahovic may be prepared to forego it if Juve simply cut him loose and allow him to find a contract elsewhere as a free-agent. Which would certainly suit United.",
      "",
      "16) Marc Guehi – Crystal Palace to Liverpool\nWith a year left on his contract and a renewal unlikely, Palace are willing to cash in on their captain – but Liverpool won’t pay the £50million or so the Eagles are demanding. Currently, we are at stalemate. Liverpool don’t seem twitchy yet, but they are keeping the lines of communication open.",
      "",
      "15) 🆕 Yoane Wissa – Brentford to Nottingham Forest\nBrentford won’t sell Wissa and Mbeumo, which surely means Forest’s failed bid for the former will give Manchester United a kick up the backside in their pursuit of the latter…right?",
      "",
      "14) 🔽 Cristhian Mosquera – Valencia to Arsenal\nArsenal had one bid rejected for the 2024 Golden Boy-shortlisted defender but they remain in talks with Valencia. Which don’t appear to be going well.",
      "",
      "13) 🔽 Sean Longstaff – Newcastle to Leeds\nAh. It was initially thought Newcastle had accepted what was thought to be Leeds’ best and final offer, worth £10million plus add-ons, but it seems not. The Toon clearly feel they can squeeze more out of Leeds. Though probably not the £50million Man Utd were once quoted by Mike Ashley.",
      "",
      "12) Eberechi Eze – Crystal Palace to Arsenal\nArsenal have met with Eze’s representatives and the player is said to be keen on the prospect of moving to the Emirates. Arsenal’s next call ought to be to Palace, who will tell the Gunners they expect Eze’s £67.5million release clause to be paid in full, not as a part-exchange deal involving players we can’t be sure actually exist.",
      "",
      "11) Djordje Petrovic – Chelsea to Bournemouth\nSunderland have expressed an interest in signing Petrovic, who impressed on loan at Strasbourg last season, but it’s Bournemouth who are in the driving seat. Andoni Iraola needs a new goalkeeper and his side have made an offer, according to Fabrizio Romano, who says the Serbian goalkeeper is ‘keen on the move’. You can’t blame him; it’s an opportunity to become the No.1 at a mid-table Premier League team.",
      "",
      "10) 🔼 Marcus Rashford – Manchester United to Barcelona\nWith Nico Williams signing a new contract with Athletic Bilbao and Liverpool ignoring interest in Luis Diaz, Rashford is said to have found himself at the top of Barca’s wish-list and the Catalans are ready to go ‘all in’. Unfortunately for Barca – and United – ‘all’ doesn’t amount to much these days. Rashford wants the move and, most likely, United will be paying him to play as a loanee at the Nou Camp next season.",
      "",
      "9) Bryan Mbeumo – Brentford to Manchester United\nUnited were confident of getting a deal done before now, with a big chunk of Ruben Amorim’s squad due back for pre-season on July 7, but still we wait. The beauty of missing your own deadline is you can simply set another. And another if need be. The latest guess for when United want Mbeumo on board is July 22 when they fly off to the United States.",
      "",
      "8) 🔼 Darwin Nunez – Liverpool to Napoli\nNapoli are ready to pay £43million plus about £4.4million for Nunez, who will be offered £100k a week after tax, which represents a slight raise on what he trousers at Anfield. Liverpool might get more from Saudi but, wisely, the Kop’s Captain Chaos prefers to stay in Europe for now. That Galatasaray are now ready to meet Napoli’s demands for Victor Osimhen ought to speed this up.",
      "",
      "7) James Trafford – Burnley to Newcastle\nThis has been going on for over a year but Newcastle are likely to get this done – finally – once the two clubs stop faffing and agree on all the T&Cs around a £30million deal.",
      "",
      "6) 🔽 Viktor Gyokeres – Sporting to Arsenal\nSo many claims and counter claims now, we’ve almost given up trying to keep up. The latest: Arsenal have offered £56million, with £4.3million then £8.6million in add-ons, which could take the total to £69million. But Sporting aren’t interested in bonuses; they are insisting on £60million up front. Just pay it, FFS, Arsenal and complete that jigsaw. They will. We think. Won’t they?",
      "",
      "5) 🔼 Evan Ferguson – Brighton to Roma\nAfter a loan spell at West Ham in which he did absolutely nothing, Ferguson is now mulling over an opportunity to join Roma on loan, with some claiming the Italians will retain the option to buy. Sounds like a great opportunity for a striker once rated at £100million to kickstart his stalling career.",
      "",
      "",
      "3) 🆕 Jordan Henderson – Ajax to Brentford\nNo romantic return to Sunderland, who are a bit busy signing everyone else, Henderson is reportedly close to signing for Brentford to replace Arsenal new boy Christian Norgaard. Thomas Tuchel will be chuffed, and so will Arne Slot, since Henderson will probably refuse to tackle any Liverpool player out of #respect.",
      "",
      "2) 🔼 Noni Madueke – Chelsea to Arsenal\nChelsea have agreed a fee with Arsenal – £52m, says Orny – and the winger has been given permission to fly back before the Club World Cup final to have a medical with the Gunners. Which will prompt some screeching U-turns among the Arsenal fan base, you would expect.",
      "",
      "1) 🔼 Anthony Elanga – Nottingham Forest to Newcastle\nNewcastle have finally reached an agreement with Forest worth £52million plus add-ons and Elanga is apparently in the North-East for a medical."

      "Does Forest making an offer about £30m below Brentford’s valuation of Wissa really constitute a ‘fresh twist’ over Man Utd’s pursuit of Mbeumo? No. If anything it reflects better on Man Utd who are far closer to finding a breakthrough in negotiations. But also obviously yes if you need to pretend things are happening at Old Trafford.",

      "That is a brave and bold line from Lloyd Canfield, Sports Journalist and Sport Social Media Manager, who reckons the Blues are ‘selling what seems to be the most obvious Salah replica the club have had in years’.",
      "Good lord. There are some similarities in underlying numbers and style but it is a frankly ludicrous and unhelpful comparison.",
      "And pretending ‘it signals the sale of a player who perhaps epitomises BlueCo’s model better than any other’ is also quite weird for two reason: the £52m sale itself of a player Chelsea signed for £29m less than two years ago epitomises that model, as does the fact ‘his replacement is an 18-year-old Brazilian wonderkid who is a talented but still relatively unknown outside of South America in Estevao Willian’.",
      "This is remarkably BlueCo Chelsea.",
      "Madueke’s modest output last season is then excused because it is ‘important to remember he had Nicolas Jackson on the end of many chances he was creating’.",
      "Why that didn’t stop six different Chelsea players assisting at least one of Jackson’s 13 goals but held Madueke back to the extent he set up fewer goals than Christopher Nkunku, Tyrique George and Jackson himself last season is unknown.",
      "‘With Liam Delap and Joao Pedro already looking clinical in the Club World Cup, Chelsea’s frontline next season could have represented an opportunity for Madueke to explode into the player most fans know he can become.’",
      "Someone’s forgetting the other £55m forward Chelsea have signed; that frontline needs to make room for Jamie Gittens too and the player with 20 combined goals and assists in 67 Premier League games makes sense if a buyer is willing to meet his price tag.",

But the combination of Kante’s inherent likeability and the Freaky Friday scenario Leicester and Chelsea found themselves locked in a decade ago led to one of the strangest yet most straightforward transfers imaginable.",

The Nigerian said he would have to consider leaving Arsenal if Zaha joined the Gunners due to the added “stress” of competing for places, with that pressure enough to evoke panic even when it was only Nicolas Pepe who moved to north London.",

He helped Spurs claim the Put The Pressure On Cup, securing his place in the PFA Team of the Year in the process, before being dropped by Mauricio Pochettino for the FA Cup semi-final, a north London derby and a match with Manchester United. Those seven minutes in a 2-1 win at White Hart Lane in May 2017 happened to mark Walker’s last in a Spurs shirt.",

Brighton, who ended the 2022/23 just a place behind Liverpool, were happy enough to watch the auction unfold and escalate.",

      "2) Declan Rice – £100m/€117.4m (West Ham to Arsenal, July 2023)\nRice could be a game-changer for Arsenal – for £100m and another £5m in add-ons, he ought to be. The double free-kick to sink Real Madrid will live long in the memory and basically helped pay back his fee.",
      "",
      "3) Moises Caicedo – £100m/€117.1m (Brighton to Chelsea, August 2023)\nThere is every chance Caicedo could jump to the top of this list soon, with around half of the £15m in add-ons a grovelling Chelsea had to offer described as easily achievable in some quarters. Liverpool had put together a £111m package but, much to some hilarious and entirely grown-up Proper Red fury, the Ecuadorean wasn’t interested.",
      "",
      "4) Paul Pogba – £93.2m/€110m (Juventus to Man Utd, August 2016)\nMan Utd never did figure out how to unlock Pogba, with the weary efforts of three different managers ultimately ending in frustration, viruses, haircuts and a second Old Trafford exit to join Juventus as a free agent.",
      "",
      "5) Jude Bellingham – £88.5m/€103m (Borussia Dortmund to Real Madrid, June 2023)\nThe idea of a £100m bargain sounds particularly weird but Bellingham is as close as is possible. Real Madrid would be thrilled if add-ons taking the deal to £115m/€133.9m were activated over the course of a six-year contract for a 21-year-old with more than 300 senior career appearances who will probably break soon.",
      "",
      "6) Frenkie de Jong – £74.5m/€86m (Ajax to Barcelona, July 2019)\nGiven a choice also involving Paris Saint-Germain and both Manchester clubs, De Jong cashed in on his rising Ajax stock at the absolute peak to join Barcelona just as they started financially collapsing in on themselves. The Dutchman has been central to their revival.",
      "",
      "7) Aurelien Tchouameni – £68.3m/€80m (Monaco to Real Madrid, June 2022)\nSimilar to Bellingham, Real Madrid would not mind paying an extra £17m/€20m if Tchouameni holds up his end of a quite stunningly executed midfield renovation.",
      "",
      "8) Arthur Melo – £66m/€72m (Barcelona to Juventus, June 2020)\nLiverpool did indeed borrow the world’s fourth most expensive midfielder ever at the time to solve problems which Arthur’s injuries only exacerbated.",
      "",
      "9) Rodri – £62.8m/€70m (Atletico Madrid to Manchester City, July 2019)\nIt was not the most seamless transition to Pepball – it never is – but Rodri went from ropey to learning the ropes and then master of the tactical fouling rest defence rope-a-dope, all the way to Champions League final goalscorer.",
      "",
      "10) Casemiro – £60m/€70m (Real Madrid to Man Utd, August 2022)\nIn a mild panic induced by consecutive defeats to Brighton and Brentford, Man Utd chucked up to £70m on a 30-year-old and gave him a four-year contract. It has worked equal parts well and disastrously.",
      "",
      "11) Martin Zubimendi – £60m/€69.5m (Real Sociedad to Arsenal, July 2025)\nLiverpool could not persuade Zubimendi to abandon the food or mountains of San Sebastian but Arsenal made the right pitch a year later, reuniting Mikel Merino with his former La Real teammate.",
      "",
      "12) Jorginho – £57m/€65m (Napoli to Chelsea, July 2018)\nManchester City could not force a deal over the line but the pull of London and Maurizio Sarri delivered Jorginho to a productive if never unanimously popular half-decade at Chelsea.",
      "",
      "13) Tanguy Ndombele – £55.4m/€62m (Lyon to Tottenham, July 2019)\nA club-record signing made so long ago that Mauricio Pochettino welcomed him to north London when Ange Postecoglou was busy winning titles with Yokohama F Marinos, Ndombele left for nothing nine games short of a century of Spurs appearances.",
      "",
      "14) Kevin de Bruyne – £55m/€75m (Wolfsburg to Manchester City, August 2015)\n“I thought it was lira,” said Paul Merson of the fee an English club had agreed to pay a German side for a Belgian player. “The world is going mad,” added Phil Thompson. That fee does look crazy for what Manchester City received in return over a decade, to be fair.",
      "",
      "15) Miralem Pjanic – £54.8m/€60m (Juventus to Barcelona, June 2020)\nRemember the Arthur entry? Well as part of a fudged pandemic transfer which seemed to point towards a future of big clubs swapping their wage-drainers because no-one had any money, Barcelona were able to press the Pjanic button for a couple of years.",
      "",
      "16) Romeo Lavia – £53m/€61.9m (Southampton to Chelsea, August 2023)\nThirty-six senior career appearances was enough for a Chelsea side gripped by their insatiable obsession with signing young midfielders. And indeed anyone. Manchester City even received £8m or so after sticking a sell-on clause into the deal which saw Lavia join Saints a year earlier.",
      "",
      "17) Matheus Nunes – £53.2m/€62m (Wolves to Manchester City, September 2023)\nThe Portugal international went on strike to force through a move to work with Pep Guardiola at City after Wolves refused the Treble winners’ first offer. The fee includes a 10 per cent sell-on clause when City are done with the 26-year-old.",
      "",
      "18) Naby Keita – £52.75m/€60m (Leipzig to Liverpool, July 2018)\nThat rare example of an expensive Liverpool transfer committee misstep. Keita seemed absolutely perfect for Klopp but 75 starts in five seasons tells a particular story which revolves around hamstrings.",
      "",
      "19) Sandro Tonali – £52m/€60m (Milan to Newcastle, July 2023)\nHelping knock new teammate Bruno Guimaraes (£40m/€50.1m) off this list, the most expensive Italian footballer in history has followed a similar path into the collective hearts of the Geordie nation.",
      "",
      "20) Fred – £52m/€58.9m (Shakhtar Donetsk to Man Utd, June 2018)\nManchester City tried to get a deal done for a little less the winter before but their exit from the race left the path clear for Man Utd to polarise their fanbase for years to come by signing a diligent, determined but ultimately limited midfielder.",

      "So the pity is out of the way let’s stick the boot in, a year ago before you came 16th I said that you were just a poor team, it’s still true, you have next to nothing in terms of players that are “Man United” standard, Bruno is the best of a bad bunch and sadly he wouldn’t get into a lot of Prem sides because he’s a bit sh*t.",
      "I really hope that this is the year you get relegated, last year was a close call and Ruben is going to keep his terrible form because he’s not that good, they’ll sack him before Christmas as they should but which idiot will take the poisoned chalice, a lot of managers have taken the United job and none have come out of the other end smelling of roses (maybe the little Norwegian but his other jobs were Molde and Cardiff), you won’t get a good manager and even if you do it won’t matter because you’re poor and will come close to the bottom 3 again (hopefully Leeds spends this mystical £300 million so they can overtake you).",
      "This team is on par with West Ham just 10 times more expensive, it’s not an insult, West Ham are okay, the problem that Man U have is, coming back to the start of this e-mail, your owners have created a toxic atmosphere, every player that has been brought in the last 5 years has been rather good at the club they were at before joining United, Onana looked like he had hands when playing for Ajax, Sancho was in German team of the season, Mason Mount wasn’t constantly injured from embarrassment and Antony was touted as a world beater.",
      "They then joined United and became terrible, this is due to the horrible place that Old Trafford and Carrington has become, it wouldn’t matter if United bought prime Messi and Ronaldo, they would go to United and fall out of love with football and turn poo, you did this to yourself.",
      "Don’t think of relegation as a problem, it is freeing, it is the only way you are going to be sold to someone who may actually like the club more than money, one of your owners has a Chelsea season pass for God’s sake, you should be protesting every match but it doesn’t matter, it won’t get the club sold, just hope for relegation and that someone nice takes over you.",

In the same way that there is logic suggesting Liverpool are one of the favourites this year, which you did, rather hypocritically after pointing out that everyone starts on zero points.",
      "There is also logic in people suggesting that the reasons for failing to do better than they have are being addressed could see them become more successful. Yes Liverpool were the best team last season and deserved the title, but Arsenal struggled without a recognised striker and should they get one, then their chances of going one better than second place are increased.

Manchester City made one offer and promptly withdrew from the race upon its rejection, leaving the Gunners with a clear track.",

      "",
      "7) Arsenal – £75m\nReports suggest that the Gunners paid £60m for Martin Zubimendi in the end, and we’re adding a few quid for Kepa from Chelsea, because Arsenal always have to buy somebody from Chelsea. And then a tenner for Christian Norgaard.",

      "",
      "4) Manchester City – £109.6m\nThat’s the price of a Rayan Ait-Nouri from Wolves, a Rayan Cherki from Lyon and a Tijanji Reijnders from AC Milan, and all of them feel like bargains. Pep Guardiola wanted Florian Wirtz but he will eventually cost more on his own.",
      "",
      "3) Tottenham – £120.52m\nSpent a decent whack of money spent on Kevin Danso, Mathys Tel, Luka Vuskovic and Kota Takai before Thomas Frank even got a say. Mohammed Kudus has shot Spurs up into the top three here and Morgan Gibbs-White will get them closer to Liverpool.",
      "",
      "2) Liverpool – £194.5m\nFlorian Wirtz has cost an initial £100m (yes, it could rise to £116m but we’re not worried about add-ons on this particular list) and Jeremie Frimpong has cost £29.5m. We have also added the £25m on Giorgi Mamardashvili as that transfer will be counted in this summer’s accounts. And now Milos Kerkez has joined for a cool £40m.",

      "1) Chelsea – £210.6m\nThey were the top spenders in the summers of 2024, 2023 and 2022 and will be up there in 2025 thanks to pre-arranged moves for Estevao, Dario Essugo, Mamadou Sarr and Kendry Paez. Throw in the £30m signing of Liam Delap and the Blues were already making very expensive waves before they signed Joao Pedro for an initial £55m and Jamie Gittens for not much less."

      "Marcus Rashford's preferred destination this summer is Barcelona and with the Catalan side missing out on Athletic Club's Nico Williams and Liverpool fending off bids for Luis Diaz, the Man Utd forward's prospects of a Spanish switch have increased...",
      "By Lyall Thomas, Senior Football News Editor",
      "Friday 4 July 2025 11:10, UK",
      "Marcus Rashford has returned to Manchester United after his loan with Aston Villa officially expired on June 30.",
      "However, the forward faces no real future at Old Trafford and he would rather be at a new club than returning to Carrington this summer.",
      "So, with pre-season looming, where does Rashford go next?",
      "Barcelona remains Rashford's preferred destination should he leave United this summer.",
      "And, intriguingly, the door could be opening on a move to Catalonia.",
      "That's because in the past week, Barcelona have seen their hopes of landing either Liverpool's Luis Diaz or Athletic Club's Nico Williams more or less extinguished.",
      "Liverpool rejected Bayern Munich's offer for Diaz - just as they rebuffed Barca's advances earlier this summer - and made it clear the Colombian is not for sale. Then on Friday, Williams signed a new 10-year deal with Athletic Club.",
      "Financial issues remain a concern at Barcelona. They have tight financial parameters set by LaLiga and a recent history of failing to register players due to problems around funding those deals.",
      "Rashford's prospects of a switch to Barcelona look more likely now than they did a week ago - but how a deal will be structured will take some work given Barcelona's financial issues, Rashford's wages at Manchester United, and the Old Trafford club's preference to sell rather than sanction another loan.",
      "It is understood that, if he cannot move to Barcelona, Rashford wants a move to another Champions League club.",
      "It is for that reason that Aston Villa appear out of the running for the moment and have not pursued a permanent deal at the £40m mark set by United.",
      "Rashford moved to Villa on loan in January and he had a promising spell there, recovering some of his best form, but Villa missed out on Champions League qualification on the final day of the season.",
      "In April, it was reported that Rashford does not want to move to London, which seemingly rules out Chelsea, Arsenal and Spurs.",
      "As United's biggest rivals, Man City and Liverpool can also be considered highly unlikely. If he wants to play for a Champions League club in England, that just leaves Newcastle.",
      "Alexander Isak is their main striker, and Eddie Howe has other targets for wingers including Anthony Elanga - who they have made a second, increased bid of around £55m for - Johan Bakayoko, Karim Adeyemi and Mo Kudus.",
      "An issue for clubs in Europe more than Saudi has been Rashford's high wages at United and how to reach an offer that would be attractive to him.",
      "A loan deal would be more manageable for European clubs but United are not keen on this and prefer a permanent sale; as they also do with Antony, Jadon Sancho and Alejandro Garnacho.",
      "However, Sancho has more concrete interest from Europe so far including Juventus, Napoli and former club Borussia Dortmund.",

      "\"There is significant interest in Bryan. His current preference has been well publicised,\" Giles said.",

      "Speaking for the first time since taking the helm at Brentford, Keith Andrews echoed Giles' stance on Mbeumo, saying it would be \"ideal\" if the forward was to stay.",

      "\"He's such a talented player. Someone I enjoyed working with, I worked closely with him last season around set pieces, so that will be the ideal scenario.",
      "\"I want the most talented players in the building. I'm very understanding of the way football and this football club work when it comes to transfers, but ultimately, I want the best players in the building.\"",
      "\"Of course, he will be a miss,\" Andrews said.",
      "\"It's a move for him that would be amazing to go to a club of that magnitude and play Champions League football. I would miss him as a person because I value him very highly.",
      "\"Christian has been pivotal in the recent history of the football club; he's worn the armband now for years. He's someone that I admire, really understand his quality and what he brings both on and off the pitch.\"",
      "The potential departure of Mbeumo and Norgaard's impending move to north London will leave Brentford with gaps to fill in their squad. Asked about whether the club will look to the market to bolster positions, Andrews said:",
      "\"It's always been about players in the building for me; that has to be the priority. There are players in the building now that have huge scope to kick onto new levels. I firmly believe that and the club has also demonstrated every season, if players leave, players will come in and the trust I have in that department is really strong.\"",
