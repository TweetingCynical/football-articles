      "Former Manchester United midfielder Scott McTominay does not appear to have any regrets about his move away from Old Trafford. He issued a 13-word statement after winning the Serie A Player of the Year award at the Gran Gala del Calcio awards on Monday night.",
      "\"Coming to Napoli was an easy choice, I came to the right place,\" he said after winning the award, as reported by The Sun. McTominay was a key figure in Napoli's Serie A title success last season, with 13 goals and six assists in all competitions for Antonio Conte's side.",
      "His fine form at the Diego Armando Maradona Stadium saw him win the Serie A MVP award for the 2024–25 campaign. The Scotland international's first season away from Old Trafford was a huge success and he's carried that on into this season, helping Scotland qualify for the World Cup in 2026.",
      "Speaking at the award ceremony on Monday night, the former United midfielder would hail his special bond with Napoli after his move in 2024. He said: \"It’s sensational, it’s incredible to be here and win this award.",
      "“Thank you to everyone, the team, the staff, and my teammates. My bond with Napoli is special, there are so many special places here.\"",
      "The 28-year-old, who made 255 appearances for United and scored 29 goals, was also named in a star-studded Serie A top XI. Current Manchester City midfielder Tijani Reijnders was named in the squad along with Inter Milan stars Alessandro Bastoni and Federico Dimarco.",
      "United supporters have been questioning the decision to sell McTominay after his brilliant start to life in Italy, with the club bringing in just £25million from his sale. Former United boss Erik ten Hag cited the need to comply with PSR as the reason behind the midfielder's departure.",
      "\"He was so important for our team,\" Ten Hag said. \"He was at Manchester United for over 22 years. But unfortunately, it’s the rules. You have to discuss the rules to do sales, and obviously homegrown players, academy players, bring more value.",
      "\"It’s not the right thing to do but, for everyone, for all parties, it’s a good deal. For Scott, he is happy with it.",
      "\"Of course, for Napoli. (They are getting) a very good player. But also for us (it’s a good deal too).\"",
      "However, the reported £25million deal now looks a bargain for Napoli and McTominay would have been an ideal candidate to play in Ruben Amorim's 3-4-3 system. McTominay will be back in action with Napoli in the Coppa Italia clash with Cagliari on Wednesday night.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Premier League clubs including Manchester United and Liverpool have been handed a boost with a new FIFA ruling allowing them to keep players for an extra week ahead of the Africa Cup of Nations. The tournament starts on December 21 with several Premier League players involved.",
      "FIFA have said that clubs do not have to release their players for the tournament until December 15. The deadline is a week later than had initially thought.",
      "It means that players including Mohamed Salah will be available for Premier League games over the weekend of December 13-14. Arne Slot, speaking on Tuesday morning, admitted: \"He'll go on December 15.\"",
      "The Kop boss added: \"The way we have worked is that there's a communication between all three - the player, the club and country. That's nothing new. But FIFA have said December 15 is last day player has to be released.\"",
      "If the deadline will allow Manchester United's Bryan Mbeumo, Amad and Noussair Mazraoui to play in their clash against Bournemouth on December 15, is still to be seen.",
      "It's not only Liverpool and United who could benefit. The Premier League side most impacted by the tournament is newly-promoted Sunderland. The Black Cats have as many as seven players expected to feature. They could all now be available for the Wear-Tyne Derby against Newcastle United on December 14.",
      "Three teams who will not be impacted at all by the tournament are Arsenal, Chelsea and Leeds United. The trio have no players in their squad who will represent their countries in the competition.",
      "Speaking ahead of his team's Premier League game against Everton last week, United boss Ruben Amorim said that the club was working to keep the players at the club for as long as they could.",
      "“We have the rules, when we have to release the players, so we will see,\" he said. “We are doing our job to try and maintain the players a little bit longer, but it is not just in our hands. We need to respect that, but we will try to do everything to protect the club, protect the players and protect the national team.\"",
      "He also took a positive view on the absence of the players for the tournament.",
      "“It is a circumstance that we already knew, but it is an opportunity for other players,\" he said. \"We also have the Under-21s and we need to also send a message in that time, so we will see.",
      "\"But of course, it is not ideal because they [Amad, Mazraoui and Mbeumo] are so important in our team and we don't have a long squad. But our Academy is for this moment, and we will be ready.”",

      "Manchester United are back in victory lane after securing a hugely valuable 2-1 win at Crystal Palace on Sunday. However, even Selhurst Park decider Mason Mount wasn't expecting to convert the decider.",
      "United skipper Bruno Fernandes made the surprise decision to tee up Mount for the winning striker rather than have a crack himself. And it was a call that even caught Mount off-guard as he recounted his moment of triumph in south London.",
      "Fernandes' free-kick finesse is well-known among fans by this stage, but United's captain stepped aside for the crucial clincher at Palace on Sunday. Or rather, he stepped up to take control of the situation before watching on as Mount delivered when the team needed him most.",
      "Making his first start in more than a month, Mount was as surprised as anyone else to see the ball had been laid off for him to hit on the edge of Dean Henderson's box. One could tell by his reaction that his skipper had caught him unaware, not that the quality of his strike gave that impression.",
      "\"We always have a little conversation,\" said Mount while recapping his pre-set-piece chat with Fernandes. \"I said to him, 'I will roll it for you,' and then he said, 'You stay there,' and then I said, 'You shoot,' because obviously the sun was difficult today and was causing a few problems for us first half with long balls and I thought it would be difficult for Deano [Henderson] to see the ball in goal.",
      "\"And then he said: 'You stay there,' and rolled it over and you can see with my reaction to getting on the end of it... He obviously said it but really quick and that's why it helped out the situation. They didn't see it coming, they didn't see us talking, they were late to react, and it is about finding that little bit of space in the wall, that little disruption, and then hit the target.\"",
      "He did precisely that, and the splintered Palace wall couldn't protect Henderson's near post as the decider bobbled home. The result was enough to move United up to seventh and just four points behind bitter rivals City in second place.",
      "Speaking of the Manchester rivalry, United and City appear to be on a collision course next year concerning the signature of Elliot Anderson. That's after it was reported City are ready to step up their interest in the Nottingham Forest star.",
      "Ruben Amorim's side have been linked with a steady string of midfield recruits over the last year. And after the buzz surrounding the likes of Adam Wharton and Carlos Baleba has died down, Anderson has taken over as United's supposed No. 1 recruit.",
      "However, the Daily Mail reported City are escalating their interest to ensure Anderson doesn't fall into the clutches of fellow admirers United or Liverpool. It's suggested Forest want in excess off £80million for the player, though a January move looks highly unlikely.",
      "Newcastle begrudgingly sold Anderson to Forest last year in order to comply with Premier League spending laws. A little more than one year on, and it looks as though the 23-year-old could fetch up to three times that fee.",
      "United could well part ways with Casemiro in the summer when his contract, which has a 12-month extension clause, is due to expire. There are also major question marks around the future of Kobbie Mainoo, whose sale could help United challenge City in the race for Anderson.",

      "The Argentina international has steadily been rebuilding his fitness over recent weeks and was included among the substitutes for last week's Premier League loss to Everton.",
      "More than 24 hours following the final whistle in south east London, Martinez has shared a post with his 6.8 million Instagram followers to reflect on his United comeback.",
      "\"Long time not being able to do what I love most and what better way to return to the court [pitch] with a very important win,\" wrote Martinez.",
      "\"They were months of suffering, uncertainty, anguish, imbalance... where the lack of energy was nothing to beat me, but I was lucky enough to count on my family, friends, teammates, fans, the club and the national team, to recharge the heart.",
      "\"Just thank you, everyone.\"",
      "Former United goalkeeper David de Gea among those responding to Martinez's post in the comments. The shot-stopper, now plying his trade with Fiorentina in Serie A, posted 'he's back' alongside a knife emoji - a nod to Martinez's butcher nickname.",
      "United teammate Joshua Zirkzee joined in with 'welcome back' accompanied by a red love heart in the comments, while Argentina teammate Rodrigo De Paul penned 'we were waiting for you, beautiful butcher'.",
      "United skipper Bruno Fernandes revealed his delight at having Martinez back in the matchday squad following the triumph over Palace.",

      "Matheus Cunha has confirmed his return to Manchester United training after a two-game absence due to a head injury. Ruben Amorim had previously stated that he expected the Brazilian star to be fit for their upcoming match against West Ham United this Thursday, and with Cunha now back in training, it seems likely he'll be available.",
      "In a recent press conference, Amorim confirmed Cunha's potential return date, stating: \"I expect to have Matheus in the next one [West Ham United], not this one [vs Crystal Palace].\"",
      "Without their summer signing, United suffered a disappointing defeat to ten-man Everton, but bounced back impressively with a 2-1 victory away to Crystal Palace last Sunday. Goals coming from Joshua Zirkzee and Mason Mount at Selhurst Park could mean Cunha starts on the bench for his comeback game.",
      "Amorim will undoubtedly be pleased to have Cunha back in his squad though, and it's clear the player himself is also delighted. Via an Instagram story with Cunha in full training gear at Carrington, he stated: \"Back back back.\"",
      "In terms of a possible fresh injury blow, there was concern over Bruno Fernandes as he was seen limping towards the end of the win over Palace. However, Amorim seemed to confirm that the Portuguese midfielder would be fine to play in future matches.",
      "\"It was a kick, I was shouting at him because he needs to learn we make a substitution in the end, he needs to talk to the bench,\" he said. \"But he said it was just a kick, so everything is OK.\"",
      "The Portuguese manager will certainly require his captain's presence during the upcoming hectic period, as United face their most congested fixture list since their Carabao Cup exit to Grimsby Town.",
      "After hosting the Hammers, United make the trip to Molineux to face Wolves next Monday night before welcoming Bournemouth for another evening fixture a week later. Their final match before Christmas sees them take on Aston Villa, followed by a Boxing Day encounter at St James' Park against Newcastle United.",
      "Lisandro Martinez is expected to make his first start in more than nine months during this run of fixtures, having made a brief substitute appearance in last Sunday's match against Palace.",
      "Meanwhile, Benjamin Sesko remains sidelined with a knee complaint sustained during the Tottenham Hotspur fixture, while Harry Maguire continues his recovery from a muscle injury picked up in that same encounter.",
      "Amorim provided updates on both players during last week's press conference, indicating that while returns could be imminent, neither player is quite match-ready.",
      "\"Sesko is going to take a little bit more time. It will take a little bit longer, and we are taking care of him,\" he said. \"Harry is the same [he will need more time].\"",
      "However, despite these cautious remarks, the Slovenian international has not experienced any complications and remains on course to feature in the Wolves fixture later this month.",

      "And while he has been in better form recently, that has not been enough to see Onana earn a reprieve when it comes to Cameroon. Onana has been left out of his nation's squad for the upcoming AFCON tournament.",
      "The 29-year-old has collected 53 caps for his country so far and played every minute during the African side's World Cup qualifying campaign that ultimately ended in failure. AFCON gets underway on December 21, with Cameroon set to take on Gabon, Ivory Coast and Mozambique in the group stage.",
      "Onana's axe comes on a dramatic day for Cameroon, with manager Marc Brys having been sacked just days before the tournament gets underway.",
      "Onana has made 11 appearances for Trabzonspor so far this season in all competitions. His performances have however reportedly been good enough for club chiefs to make a move for him on a permanent basis.",
      "Speaking earlier this season, Amorim said on his goalkeeper's loan departure: “We saw Andre had a very, very good season at Inter. The quality is there. But we are in the club and sometimes, in the moment, things can get harder and harder.",
      "“You can be really experienced but in this club, the pressure is sometimes so hard on every detail. I think we understood that this needed a change. Sometimes it’s hard to point why. It’s the performance, the moments. The bad luck in some moments was hard on him, was hard on us. Our thinking is to have a change in the goalkeepers.”",
      "Onana started his career with Dutch side Ajax before moving to Italian giants Inter Milan. He went on to become one of Europe's standout goalkeepers during his time in Serie A.",
      "His form was good enough to convince the Red Devils to pay £43m for his services in 2023. He spent two seasons as United's number one, albeit high-profile mistakes blighted his game at Old Trafford.",
      "He was eventually allowed to leave the club this summer and was replaced by Senne Lammens, who joined United from Royal Antwerp. The Belgian has enjoyed a bright start to life at Old Trafford despite just one clean sheet in his opening seven games.",

      "A clumsy challenge by Leny Yoro on the Palace striker handed him an opportunity to break the deadlock from the penalty spot. Mateta coolly converted his effort, with Senne Lammens diving the wrong way, but replays revealed the ball had accidentally brushed his left foot.",
      "VAR directed Rob Jones to announce to the stadium that Mateta would be permitted to retake the penalty. He said: \"After review, Crystal Palace No.14 touches the ball accidentally twice as the ball goes into the net. The final decision is a retaken penalty.\"",
      "\"What they decided now is because it's accidental and he's scored it's a retake. If he missed, it would've been an indirect free-kick. I think it's only fair. He doesn't mean to slip.\"",
      "Nevertheless, Jay Bothroyd has explained why United should feel aggrieved by Mateta being granted a second opportunity after his blunder. \"I don't agree with that,\" he added.",
      "\"You step up to take a penalty and you plant your foot and touch the ball, it's bad technique. If you take a bad touch, it's just a bad touch. He's planted his foot ahead of the ball and has cut across it.",
      "\"That's his fault. He shouldn't get the opportunity to take it again for his mistake.\"",
      "Had this situation occurred last season, it would have been deemed a missed penalty by Mateta, but Julian Alvarez's contentious double-touch in Atletico Madrid's Champions League shoot-out defeat to Real Madrid prompted Ifab to enter talks with UEFA.",
      "The regulation has since been amended to specify if an accidental 'double-touch' spot-kick finds the net, then it should be retaken rather than disallowed. Fortunately, it didn't prove too crucial, with Joshua Zirkzee and Mason Mount both finding their mark to swing the match in United's direction.",
      "The triumph at Selhurst Park provided the ideal response to their home defeat against Everton on Monday night, despite enjoying a man advantage for more than an hour. With Palace having featured in France just days before, Amorim acknowledged that factor contributed to their success.",
      "He said: \"It was small details that helped. The pace and intensity was better in the second half. I could see that Palace were getting tired at the end of the first half and knew they would suffer if we scored.",
      "\"We went on to control the game well away from our goal and in the opposition's half. We controlled the game well, but just have to be careful about what we did in the first half.\"",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Gary Neville has been accused of ‘killing’ Scott McTominay’s career at Manchester United by Jamie Carragher. The Red Devils academy graduate made 255 appearances for his boyhood club before making a shock move to Italian giants Napoli.",
      "McTominay has shone during his time in Naples, scoring 18 goals in 53 appearances in all competitions. He claimed the Italian title in his debut season and was named the best player in Serie A. Ex-United star Neville has claimed that it might have been an error letting him leave.",
      "Speaking on The Overlap, Neville said: “What’s happened to Scott McTominay? Have we made a massive mistake?”",
      "Fellow pundit Jamie Carragher replied: “You’ve killed another Man United player, that’s what happened. Too much criticism, [saying] he’s not good enough.”",
      "Ian Wright then chimed in as he said: “I remember Gary saying they’ve got to get rid of him. Poor Scott. He just wanted some freedom.”",
      "However, Neville then insisted that he wasn’t as critical as others thought and suggested that McTominay should have been kept. He added: “I didn’t say he wasn’t good enough… Not me. Seriously I never thought they should have got rid of him. I always said at the time, he’s a squad player, in the 15 or 16. He should never have been got rid of.”",
      "Despite his defence Neville had indeed been critical of McTominay on a number of occasions in the past. Speaking in 2018, he suggested that the Scottish international may have to consider changing his position in order to have a career at Old Trafford.",
      "He said: “McTominay, when I watch him, I’m not sure he’s actually good enough on the ball to be a Man United midfield player.",
      "“I do think he’s the type that it’s good for him to play games in there – but I do wonder whether if actually he’s got more of a position at centre back eventually, the physicality that he has. He’s a big lad. Is he sharp enough on the ball to be a Man United central midfield player?”",
      "McTominay could potentially be celebrating a second league title come the end of the season. Having helped Napoli to the Italian crown last term, Antonio Conte’s men sit second and are only behind leaders AC Milan on goal difference this time around.",
      "McTominay has actually been linked with a move back to the Premier League on a host of occasions. Everton have recently been credited with an interest. His deal with Napoli is set to run until 2028.",

      "Former Manchester United flop Antony was the subject of abuse while watching the chaos-filled Seville derby. The 25-year-old was ineligible to play for Real Betis in their Sunday clash against rivals Sevilla after being sent off a week prior against Girona.",
      "Taking his place in a box in the stands, the Brazilian was present to watch his side earn an impressive 2-0 victory, thanks to goals from ex-West Ham midfielder Pablo Fornals and Sergi Altimira.",
      "Antony, who joined Betis on a permanent deal this past summer after his six-month loan, was spotted supporting his team via footage taken from the stands. The winger was seen taunting the home fans when celebrating one of Betis' goals at the Ramon Sanchez-Pizjuan Stadium.",
      "Videos posted across social media platforms showed Antony shouting and raising his arms at Sevilla fans, who retaliated by throwing bottles and other objects at his box. Other fans could be seen gesturing their middle finger at the footballer in what was a fierce atmosphere that eventually boiled over on the pitch.",
      "With Betis 2-0 up and just eight minutes left to go, Sevilla winger Isaac Romero was shown a straight red card for a dangerous challenge on Betis's Valentin Gomez. Romero being given his marching orders only led to further chaos in the stands with bottles and other projectiles being thrown on the pitch.",
      "The rising unrest led referee Jose Luis Mubuera Montero to suspend the game. Proceedings were halted for 15 minutes before the two teams returned and played out the final few minutes of the clash.",
      "The victory for ex-Manchester City boss Manuel Pellegrini saw Betis rise to fifth in LaLiga and are now seven points behind Atletico Madrid in the final Champions League qualification place.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "After a nightmare three-year stint at Old Trafford, Antony has reignited his once-blossoming career in Spain with 15 goals and eight assists in his 39 appearances for Betis thus far. After leaving United this past summer, the winger said: \"What happened in Manchester, only I know how difficult it was.\"",
      "With six goals in 13 games already this season, the Brazil international has played a huge role in Betis' recent ascendancy but his ill-discipline almost flared up again during their Europa League match against Utrecht.",
      "In the Thursday night game, Antony very nearly picked what would have been a second consecutive red card when appearing to headbutt his opponent, Souffian El Karouani.",
      "The Utrecht left-back went down clutching his head, but the Betis ace escaped a caution. The clash was then sent to review by VAR, but the officiating team also cleared Antony of any punishment.",

      "Antony has been told that \"no one cared if he played or not\" at Manchester United. The Brazil winger endured a lacklustre three-year stint with the Red Devils between 2022 and 2025, albeit the last half-year of his tenure was spent on loan at Real Betis.",
      "Despite being unable to hit the ground running at Old Trafford, the 25-year-old ultimately thrived on Spanish soil at the back end of 2024/25, racking up nine goals and five assists across all competitions for the club. As a result of his fine form, Betis opted to make his transfer permanent this summer, securing Antony on a fee of around £21.5million.",
      "This season so far, Antony has managed another six goals and three assists for his new club, in 13 appearances across La Liga and the Europa League. And while he has enjoyed a career turnaround at the Estadio Benito Villamarin, a Spanish football expert has now explained where he believes it all went wrong at United for Antony.",
      "\"It was an obvious case of a player who was down in the dumps at Man Utd, wasn't popular with the fan-base. No one cared if he played or not, if they were a Man Utd fan.",
      "\"Most of them preferred he didn't play. The manager didn't have any faith in him. So when he gets off the plane at Betis and there's a whole host of supporters there waiting to greet him, and the manager picked him and told him how important he was, I just think his self-esteem was back.",
      "\"And he can play. It can be a bit of a joke; 'Oh, Anthony, the league can't be very good if he's scoring goals, blah, blah, blah'. But he's a really good player. He's the second most popular player at Betis, though he's never going to overtake Isco.\"",
      "Gibson had the pleasure of watching Real Betis in the flesh this weekend, on co-commentary duty for Premier Sport 1 as the club ran out 2-0 winners over Sevilla. Pablo Fornals opened the scoring for the club in the second-half, before Sergi Altimira sealed the deal with around 20 minutes left to play.",
      "However, Antony was not included in Pellegrini's squad for the derby, as a result of sustaining a red card against Girona on November 23. In that incident, Antony attempted a late overhead kick, missing the ball completely and accidentally kicking Joel Roca in the head.",
      "While he was initially only shown a yellow card for it, the referee upgraded it to a straight red after a VAR review. As a result, he missed the all-Seville showdown weekend.",
      "It comes as Gibson also highlighted potential problems with Marcus Rashford securing a permanent switch to Barcelona next summer. The 28-year-old is currently enjoying a season-long loan under Hansi Flick at Barcelona, after falling out of favour under Ruben Amorim.",
      "And with the Catalan giants holding an option to make the move permanent come season's end, Rashford's future could be set at the Camp Nou. However, Gibson has highlighted that Barca might struggle to raise the funds, given their struggles in that area.",
      "He said: \"It's not as easy to find £30m for Barcelona as it is normally. But back in the new stadium now, charging a fortune for tickets at the moment, 45,000 at the weekend, it's going to keep creeping up.",
      "\"And then Barcelona, before too long, will be back on a familiar financial footing. And they'll be setting their sights very high to bring back in superstars at Barcelona.\"",
      "Rashford will hope to make an impact in Barcelona's clash with Atletico Madrid on Tuesday night, after appearing as a second-half substitute against Alaves this weekend. Barca currently top the La Liga table, just three points ahead of Diego Simeone's side at present - and they will hope to expand that gap when the two teams meet at the Camp Nou.",
      "FC Barcelona vs Atletico de Madrid is available for fans in the UK to watch live on Premier Sports 1, from 7.55pm on Tuesday night.",

      "After Joshua Zirkzee ’s equaliser, the former Chelsea man fired home from a short Bruno Fernandes free-kick. The win at Selhurst Park lifted United to seventh and just three points behind the top four.",
      "And Mount believes that the Champions League places should be a tangible target for the side. He said: “It's been up and down but I think we are in a lot better place, not just me personally but as a group, and we really need to kick on now and win more games. That's the most important thing now.",
      "“A difficult result last game [vs Everton ] but to come back and win today was massively important. Yeah, it's time to really kick on and shoot for those top four positions.”",
      "While United are now setting their sights on the top four, they have already claimed one title this season. Amorim’s side have already scored from a league-high 10 set piece situations - the same amount as table-topping Arsenal.",
      "After finding the net from another, Mount expressed his satisfaction at the Red Devils’ threat from dead balls. He said: “I love being in those situations and you don't always get that many chances in a game, especially in the Premier League. So when that chance is there it's about taking that chance and hitting the target and at least making the keeper make a save.",
      "“How big set pieces are in the game now… yeah, for me hitting the target I'm very buzzing to see it hit the back of the net and to score and most importantly get the three points for the team.”",
      "Mount is not the only one to have expressed the importance of set pieces for United this season. Boss Amorim has also suggested that it would be nonsensical to not practice them - regardless of the opponent.",
      "He said: “It’s so important in our league because it's hard to play against every opponent. You can sense throw-ins, free-kicks, corners, to score a goal and open the game to give confidence to the team. In the Premier League, if you don’t work on set pieces, you are losing the game already.”",

      "Eduardo was in action for Brazil in Qatar and was one of the players heavily scouted across the tournament. The South American nation finished fourth in the World Cup, losing on penalties in the semi-final to Portugal.",
      "Spanish outlet AS has claimed that Eduardo's performances have seen him emerge as one of the standout players. The Brazil captain's electric pace has put clubs, including United, on red alert.",

      "United have emphasised signing wonderkids with an eye on developing them and using them in the first team. In previous years, the Reds have bought Chido Obi, Sekou Kone and Diego Leon in a bid to bolster their next generation of talent.",
      "Ruben Amorim has also earned plaudits for the trust he places in his younger players. 15-year-old JJ Gabriel has already been invited to train with the first team, with the wonderkid making the headlines over the weekend.",
      "The midfielder scored three goals in a 7-0 win over Liverpool for the Under-18s with silky footwork, dribbling and finishing wowing figures at the football club. Gabriel has been involved in first-team training in recent weeks, with speculation over his senior debut growing by the week.",
      "Gabriel has the potential to become United's youngest-ever Premier League player. Angel Gomes (16 years, 263 days), Shola Shoretire (17 years, 19 days) and Chido Obi (17 years, 79 days) are the youngest players to make an appearance for United in the Premier League.",
      "He could even topple the Premier League record held by Ethan Nwaneri (15 years, 181 days). Max Dowman (15 years, 235 days) is the second youngest. The teenager turns 16 next October.",

      "\"It was sad, we lost to Watford of course and I knew this was more or less the end. [I] drove my family to the airport, they went back to Norway actually and I was going to work. I got a text, 'Ole, I need to see you in my office', and I knew what was going to happen so I rang my wife straight away.",
      "\"'I'll be back, I'll catch you up', I said. I think it's sudden but not surprising. If you don't get results, you do make a change in football but I felt we had something going.\" Taking the United job is a daunting prospect at any time, especially for a manager who hadn't even coached a side in the English top-flight as was the case for Solskjaer.",
      "But even for the most seasoned of bosses, it was a job that proved too pressurised, according to the Norwegian. During the interview with the BBC, he claimed that then-Everton boss Carlo Ancelotti said he wouldn't want the United job mid-way through a clash against the Toffees.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "With the likes of Juventus, AC Milan, Chelsea, Paris Saint-Germain, Real Madrid and Bayern Munich on his CV, it was quite the statement from the Italian. Solskjaer explained: \"I remember one game - Everton. Stood there in my technical area.",
      "\"Carlo Ancelotti comes across, so he's more or less in my technical area. Fourth official says, 'Carlo, you need to go back into your technical area, unless you want Ole's job.' And he said 'no, no, no, too much pressure.",
      "\"That job is too much pressure'. You know pressure is a privilege, he's always said that as well, and I felt privileged to be the manager of Man Utd, but of course, you're the face of everyone, everything surrounding Man Utd.\"",

      "There have been bumps along the way - the defeats to Grimsby Town, Manchester City and Everton were particularly shocking - but United are in a strong position as they head into the winter.",
      "Crystal Palace felt like a must-win game given the context of the last few weeks. United started November with draws against Nottingham Forest and Tottenham, and then lost to Everton in a lifeless display, so they could not afford to end the month with a defeat at Selhurst Park.",
      "United welcome struggling West Ham to Old Trafford on Thursday night, and the fixture is a superb opportunity to record back-to-back league wins for just the second time this season.",
      "The in-house target for this campaign was to secure a spot in European football. Club sources deliberately did not specify the Champions League, but United must be aiming to return to that competition.",
      "That means winning back-to-back games regularly throughout the campaign. West Ham have won just once on the road this term, and United can't squander such a presentable opportunity.",
      "Matheus Cunha is expected to return to the squad to face West Ham. Cunha suffered a 'minor injury' in training last month, but it was serious enough to keep him out against Everton and Crystal Palace.",
      "Cunha's absence was a blow and the presumption is that he will return to the starting team upon his return, although that would mean one of the goalscorers from last weekend would lose their place.",
      "Amorim stuck by Joshua Zirkzee when most would have dropped him to face Palace. Zirkzee didn't offer much against Everton, but he was given another chance to show what he can do.",
      "That looked like a bad decision in the first half. Zirkzee followed every good touch with a loose touch and wasn't a goal threat, but he popped up quickly following the interval to score a superb goal.",
      "Zirkzee is not a natural goalscorer, yet he found the net like a prolific forward, brilliantly taking the ball down and lashing a volley beyond Dean Henderson, who was guarding the front post.",
      "The finish was so good that it was almost as if a Zirkzee doppelgänger had come out to play the second half. The Dutchman has not been associated with such goals during his up and down time in Manchester.",
      "\"It was really important,\" said Amorim of Zirkzee's goal. \"But again, it was not just the goal, even the runs behind. In the first half he struggled on the duels and he won some duels in the second half.",
      "\"We improved a lot because of the quality of Josh in the second half. That is important for him to understand. That is not just the goal. We play better because Josh played better in the second half.\"",
      "Mason Mount made his first start for United since playing against Liverpool at Anfield, and the midfielder delivered another strong performance, working tirelessly and scoring to make it 2-1.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo, Mount and Zirkzee were the attacking trio and Amorim will have to decide who to drop between the Palace goalscorers if he wants to bring Cunha back into the side.",
      "It's not out of the question that Cunha starts on the bench. He was named on the bench against Chelsea in September after returning from an injury, and Amorim could ease him back into action again.",
      "However, Cunha returned from a muscle injury on that occasion, whereas the reason for his recent absence has been said to be due to a training ground accident, which shouldn't be as serious as a muscle issue.",
      "It will be a tough decision between Mount and Zirkzee if Cunha is immediately recalled. The Dutchman is the favourite to lose his place, but his second-half performance against Palace was impressive, and there is a train of thought that a forward shouldn't lose their place after scoring.",
      "Nonetheless, it's a welcome attacking headache for Amorim ahead of the West Ham game.",

      "It may have been freezing conditions near the away dressing room at Selhurst Park at full time, but the jovial mood among the Manchester United squad was keeping spirits warm. Captain Bruno Fernandes joked with Joshua Zirkzee to pull his trousers up while a beaming Luke Shaw spoke at length with veteran commentator Martin Tyler before heading to the team bus.",
      "Ruben Amorim was keen to continue the positive atmosphere as he took one look at the assembled cast of journalists waiting in the mixed zone and teased doing a preliminary press conference before the main event. In the end, he made his apologies and ran up the stairs to the Media Centre.",
      "Match winner Mason Mount's positivity was obvious as he strolled up to the journalists, joking that we were blocking him from exiting. When the laughter subsided, Mount took us into the conversation between himself and Fernandes shortly before the winner.",
      "He explained: \"We always have a little conversation. I said to him: 'I will roll it for you,' and then he said: 'You stay there,' and then I said: 'You shoot,' because obviously the sun was difficult today and was causing a few problems for us first half with long balls and I thought it would be difficult for Deano [Henderson] to see the ball in goal.",
      "\"And then he said: 'You stay there,' and rolled it over and you can see with my reaction to getting on the end of it...He obviously said it but really quick and that's why it helped out the situation. They didn't see it coming, they didn't see us talking, they were late to react and it is about finding that little bit of space in the wall, that little disruption and then hit the target.\"",
      "Sunday was the first time Mount has completed 90 minutes in the league since he was at Chelsea, coincidentally against the same opposition as this weekend. \"It felt like a long time,\" Mount laughed when asked about playing the full game.",
      "\"It is obviously a massive positive for me as well. I have been working hard recently, I feel really good now so to get that 90 minutes under my belt is really positive, it is all about recovery now and going towards the next game.\"",
      "At half-time it felt as though such a light-hearted conversation with Mount was not going to take place. United were poor in the opening 45 minutes and were deservedly behind at the break thanks to Jean-Philippe Mateta's re-taken penalty.",
      "While United fans may have been panicking, this was not the case for Amorim in the dressing room. Mount said: \"He was saying to keep going, stay calm do what we needed to do. We all knew what to do in that second half.",
      "\"They have just played recently so we felt they could drop off in that second half, there was chances there for us so just carry on what we are doing. Obviously difficult to go down 1-0 but we showed character to get back into the game in the second half.\"",
      "While not the perfect performance, the result is all that matters at this stage for the Reds. They are now back within touching distance of the top four and Mount was clear his desire is now to push on.",
      "He said: \"I have had niggles but nothing bad at all [this season]. I have felt good this season, I had a good pre-season under my belt, I have been working hard in training every week, not just me, but as a group we have been at it, it's up and down but we are in a lot better place me personally and a group.",
      "\"We need to kick on now, win more games and the most important thing is to win, difficult result in the last game but to come back today was massively important. So yeah it is time to kick on now and shoot for those top four positions.\"",

      "As Manchester United applauded the away section at Selhurst Park, Leny Yoro walked with his hood up. Yoro was visibly disappointed with his performance and Mason Mount put an arm around him.",
      "Mount spoke a few words of encouragement to Yoro and patted him as if to say 'don't worry about it'. The defender was brought off in the 54th minute and TV cameras showed him crestfallen on the bench.",
      "Yoro appears to be his own harshest critic. He was aware his performance against Crystal Palace was poor and seemed to be beating himself up, even after the three points were secured.",
      "United now have one choice with Yoro: support him and take him out of the firing line to help restore his confidence. He only celebrated his 20th birthday last month, and every young player is bound to have challenging moments, but what truly matters is how one reacts to adversity.",
      "Yoro's display wasn't a complete surprise after his showing against Everton last Monday, as he'd been one of the culprits in the build-up to Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall's goal at Old Trafford.",
      "The warning signs were there in Croydon. Matthijs de Ligt and Yoro got their wires crossed, which led to a sitter for Jean-Philippe Mateta, but Yoro redeemed himself with a superb block to deny Yeremy Pino.",
      "That was until Yoro made a clumsy challenge to concede a penalty. It was the type of tackle made by a player struggling with confidence. Yoro was not in a position to yield a clean challenge and he still attempted to win the ball, which inevitably meant Mateta was fouled in the penalty area.",
      "Yoro probably wouldn't have tried to make that challenge if he were in a better vein of form. He was aware he wasn't playing at his best and was desperate to try to make a difference, which led to a bad decision.",
      "The consensus in the press box during the interval as United trailed 1-0 was they had little chance of winning after an awful 45 minutes, but they reacted in a much-improved second half.",
      "Johsua Zirkzee and Mount scored brilliant goals to wrap up a victory, condemning Palace to a first defeat at Selhurst Park in the Premier League for nine months. Palace grew weary due to their Thursday night exploits, but that should not take away from United's reaction after a dismal first half.",
      "Mount should be lauded for exchanging a few thoughtful words with Yoro after the final whistle. The midfielder comes across as genuine when he speaks to journalists in the mixed zone, and made sure to comfort Yoro when he could have just lapped up the adulation for his goal.",
      "When Yoro recently spoke to reporters at Carrington, he spoke about strong bonds in the dressing room after the decision from Amorim to axe a handful of players in the summer window.",
      "\"This is just one group of friends. This is the best for the team,\" said Yoro. His teammates will support him after Palace and remind him that peaks and troughs are all part of the journey as a player.",
      "Rio Ferdinand wrote on social media: \"This game can send you crazy at times… Use these learnings as fuel. He’s a young player and will bounce back. It's a new day tomorrow.\"",
      "Yoro suffered a bad week and will become a better player for it, because making mistakes is the only way to learn. Amorim was right to bring him off early in the second half, and it's logical to remove him from the spotlight against West Ham on Thursday night to protect his confidence.",
      "Lisandro Martinez made his first appearance since picking up an anterior cruciate ligament injury at the beginning of February and could replace Yoro in the starting team, while Noussair Mazraoui is also an option, along with Ayden Heaven, so there is no need to start Yoro against West Ham.",
      "Giving Yoro a breather after two disappointing performances will do him the world of good. It would be common-sense management of a player who is still young and developing aspects of his game.",
      "There will be a time when Yoro is held to a higher standard, but he wouldn't have been human if he hadn't had a few off days along the way to reaching his full potential. He will come back stronger after Selhurst Park.",

Bryan Mbeumo, Noussair Mazraoui and Amad are all set to travel to Morocco for the tournament but Ruben Amorim will be able to select them for slightly longer.",
      "United will have their trio for a week longer, which could see them feature against Bournemouth on December 15, having initially been due to join up with their international teammates a week earlier. The Daily Mail has reported that players will report for duty around December 15, seven days later than the initial deadline.",
      "The Portuguese tactician revealed recently that United would speak to the respective federations over a possible extension, in order to avoid losing star players for longer.",
      "United will now have Amad, Mbeumo and Mazraoui available for selection for their clash against winless Wolves. If FIFA had denied the request for an extension, this week's visit from West Ham United would be the final time that the likes of Amad and Mbeumo could be selected.",
      "The competition kicks off on December 21 before the knockout stages begin at the beginning of January. The latter stages will take place between January 9 and 10 then the semi-finals will be staged on January 14, while the championship match will be played on January 18 with the third-place playoff a day earlier.",
      "Depending on how far the likes of Ivory Coast (Amad), Cameroon (Mbeumo) and the hosts Morocco (Mazraoui) go in the tournament, they will miss Aston Villa (December 21), Newcastle United (December 26) and the reverse fixture against Wolves (December 30) at the minimum.",

      "Manchester United returned to winning ways on Sunday with a 2-1 victory at Crystal Palace. The Reds were slow in the first half and an opener from the home side always looked to be on the cards.",
      "When Leny Yoro clumsily brought down Jean-Philippe Mateta, the striker gave Palace the lead. United were revitalised after the break and two set pieces made the difference. Fernandes set up Joshua Zirkzee for the equaliser and then laid the ball off for Mason Mount to win it.",
      "After a much-needed three points for United, MEN Sport has taken a look at the moments you may have missed from the game:",
      "Martinez leads the way",
      "Coming onto the pitch before the game, the substitutes arrived around ten minutes after the starting XI. As they emerged, most of the players trudged towards the centre circle. But one man who was definitely ready for action was Lisandro Martinez. He led the way onto the pitch and looked back at his fellow subs as if to demand they picked up the pace. It shows the mentality and standards he is setting.",
      "United need leaders in the dressing room and having Martinez back fit is a huge boost.",
      "Casemiro and Henderson reunion",
      "Just before the first big chance of the game, Casemiro took the chance to reunite with Dean Henderson. He clasped hands with the former United goalkeeper. Moments later, the Brazilian gave him a gift as he somehow did not convert from close range.",
      "Special kind of pain",
      "It was a special kind of torture for United as they conceded the opener. The first goal looked fine at first glance, and \"Boom, boom, boom, boom, Mateta's in the room\" was chanted by the home fans.",
      "United fans could be heard chanting ‘What the f****** hell was that?’ but unfortunately for them, VAR ensured another rendition would follow as Mateta converted his second attempt.",
      "Yoro head in hands",
      "After United equalised there were wild scenes in the away end, but Yoro couldn't hide his frustration at his own performance. He had his hands on his head while sitting on the bench after being replaced by Noussair Mazraoui. It has been a difficult week for Yoro but he is still young and he will learn from a tough few days.",
      "Fernandes comes good",
      "After the Everton defeat, Bruno Fernandes will not have been happy with his own performance. However, the theory that when the captain plays well, United play well was clear after this victory.",
      "Fernandes was not in the first half but he led from the front in the second. His two free kicks aside, the Portuguese midfielder impressed with his work rate and set the standard for his teammates - a good afternoon after a rocky start for him.",

      "Manchester United won 2-1 against Crystal Palace in the Premier League on Sunday. United needed to respond to a shocking defeat against Everton at the beginning of the week and they secured an important win on the road.",
      "Jean-Philippe Mateta opened the scoring in the 36th minute from the penalty spot. Leny Yoro clumsily brought the forward to the ground and Mateta fired Palace into a well-deserved lead.",
      "United equalised in the second half through Joshua Zirkzee before Mason Mount scored the winner.",
      "Here are how United's players rated at Selhurst Park:",
      "Senne Lammens",
      "Made a few saves you would expect him to make in the first half, but he was the pick of a bad bunch in the opening 45 minutes. 6",
      "Leny Yoro",
      "Had another bad game. Yoro got away with a blunder when Mateta failed to finish and appeared to redeem himself with an important block, but he made a clumsy challenge to concede the penalty. 3",
      "Matthijs de Ligt",
      "Mateta is an old-school centre-forward and asked questions of De Ligt from the first whistle, winning the physical battle and pulling him out of position. Looked more comfortable in the second half. 5",
      "Luke Shaw",
      "Shaw made a great block to deny Palace a two-goal advantage just before half-time. Not much attacking threat came down his side all afternoon, which was a compliment from the hosts. Booked for a professional foul. 6",
      "Amad",
      "Was relocated to right-wing back, where he has looked comfortable, but he wasn't involved with the intricate play he is capable of orchestrating down that side. Could have done better. 5",
      "Casemiro",
      "Amorim could not believe that Casemiro did not fire United into the lead just a minute into the match. The Brazilian wasted a header from a free-kick, but improved after a shaky start. 5",
      "Bruno Fernandes",
      "Fernandes is world-class because he creates something even when he is having an off day. Fernandes was responsible for both of United's assists from set-piece routines. 7",
      "Diogo Dalot",
      "Dalot was recalled by default but made a difference with his long throw-ins, although it would have been difficult to have been a downgrade on Patrick Dorgu after his display against Everton. 7",
      "Bryan Mbeumo",
      "Mbeumo was untouchable before the international break, but he hasn't returned with as much zest. He still worked hard down the right, but he is capable of more in the final third. 5",
      "Mason Mount",
      "Made his first start since playing a key role in the win against Liverpool at Anfield. His performance was similar - hard working and industrious, but there was a key difference: he scored. 8",
      "Joshua Zirkzee",
      "Offered nothing in the first half, following up a good touch with a bad one, but equalised with a brilliant finish. Zirkzee's half-volley had to be powerful to beat the goalkeeper - and it was. 7",
      "Noussair Mazraoui",
      "He was an improvement on Yoro. 6",
      "Lisandro Martinez",
      "Fine on his appearance since February. 6",
      "Patrick Dorgu",
      "Arrived late on. N/A",
      "Kobbie Mainoo",
      "Same as Dorgu. N/A",

The 29-year-old goalkeeper was exiled from Ruben Amorim's squad before signing for Trabzonspor on a temporary basis in the summer, though he does not seem to have a future at Old Trafford.",
      "Altay Bayindir and later on summer signing Senne Lammens saw Onana omitted from United's set up before his move to Turkiye. He has since made ten appearances for Trabzonspor with three clean sheets arriving in that time.",
      "Onana has also made three appearances for Cameroon with two of those fixtures ending in defeat for his national team. The most recent loss came against DR Congo which saw Cameroon out of the running to qualify for next summer's World Cup.",

Instead, Simon Omossola, Devis Epassy, Simon Ngapandouetnbu and Edouard Sombang will be the 'keepers heading to the tournament.",

      "Matheus Cunha has confirmed he is back in Manchester United training after missing their last two games with a head injury. Ruben Amorim stated last week that he expects to have the Brazil international back to face West Ham United this Thursday and with Cunha back on the grass, he looks set to be available.",
      "Amorim had confirmed as such in a recent press conference when asked about a potential return date for Cunha. He said: \"I expect to have Matheus in the next one [West Ham United], not this one [vs Crystal Palace].\"",
      "Without the summer signing, United suffered a very bad defeat to ten-man Everton but the response was emphatic this past weekend as they beat Crystal Palace 2-1 at Selhurst Park. Joshua Zirkzee and Mason Mount were both on target which could see Cunha on the bench for his return match.",
      "Nonetheless, Amorim will almost certainly be pleased to have Cunha back in his squad and its fair to say the man himself is also very pleased. Via Instagram stories, with Cunha in full training gear at Carrington, he said: \"Back back back.\"",
      "That fitness boost looked set to arrive alongside a major blow as Bruno Fernandes was captured on camera limping in the latter stages of the win over Palace. However, Amorim seemingly confirmed he would be fine to feature going forward.",
      "“It was a kick, I was shouting at him because he needs to learn we make a substitution in the end, he needs to talk to the bench,\" he said. \"But he said it was just a kick, so everything is OK.”",
      "And Amorim will certainly need his captain over the coming weeks as United face a busier schedule than usual with their first midweek clash since the Carabao Cup defeat to Grimsby Town.",
      "Following the visit of West Ham, United travel to Wolves next Monday evening before hosting Bournemouth under the lights again seven days later. Their last clash before Christmas comes against Aston Villa with a Boxing Day clash at Newcastle United following that.",
      "A first start in over nine months for Lisandro Martinez will likely arrive during that period after his brief returning cameo against the Seagulls last Sunday.",
      "As for Benjamin Sesko, he is still missing because of a knee injury picked up against Tottenham Hotspur while Harry Maguire is yet to return from a muscular problem suffered in that same game.",
      "Amorim delivered updates on both in his press conference last week which suggested that returns are on the way, but neither are quite ready just yet.",

      "Manchester United have returned to winning ways as they came from behind to beat Crystal Palace 2-1.",
      "United were second best in the first half and went behind with ten minutes remaining as Jean-Philippe Mateta was clumsily brought down by Leny Yoro. After VAR ordered a retake due to a double touch, the striker scored from the spot.",
      "But after the break United made their fresher legs count. They equalised from nothing as Bruno Fernandes’ free kick picked out Joshua Zirkzee who composed himself before firing in.",
      "Moments later the game was turned on its head. Fernandes laid off a free kick for Mason Mount to fire home through a crowd and the Reds did well to hold on and claim a big three points on the road.",
      "Follow all the reaction and look back at the highlights below…",
      "Thank you for joining us on the United blog. This is the end of our coverage",
      "Amorim joked United have improved their set-piece record by \"stealing\" ideas from rivals in the Premier League, following a 2-1 victory over Crystal Palace on Sunday. Jean-Philippe Mateta opened the scoring from the spot in the 32nd minute. United were awful in the first half and the hosts thoroughly deserved their one-goal advantage at the interval.",
      "United looked like a different team when play resumed. Joshua Zirkzee equalised, firing his half-volley beyond Dean Henderson, and Mason Mount made it 2-1 from another set-piece routine.",
      "Read what he said here >>>",
      "\"Great feeling, it’s always a good feeling but most importantly just got us back into the game and this guy [Mount] scored a pretty good goal after. It was all about three points today, just very happy we got them.",
      "\"It’s one of the biggest clubs in the world and you have to perform so if you don’t score for a long time it can get to you but I’m surrounded by great players, great people and we help each other every day.",
      "\"So they made it quite easy for me and today is just a reward I think for patience, hard work, trying to be consistent and I’m just thankful to them.\"",
      "\"We’ve not found it easy away from home this season, obviously a very difficult result in the last game so we knew we needed to bounce back.",
      "\"That’s what we spoke about before the game, I thought we showed good character to come back after the 1-0 down first half so it was about reacting in the changing room. Second half, and I thought we did that really good. We came out and we were at it.",
      "\"I’m feeling good, the win obviously was massive but also for me to play the full game, I can’t remember, I haven’t done that in a while. I’ve been feeling really good recently, no problems, I’m enjoying my football and when you have days like this in front of fans like this it makes it all worth it.\"",
      "Ruben Amorim hurried to the Selhurst Park dressing room at half-time. Manchester United were trailing 1-0 after an awful first half. Whatever Amorim said to the players worked when play resumed.",
      "The good work of October was in danger of being undone by an awful November, but United clawed their way back into the game, winning the battle of endurance against a tired Crystal Palace. The season is a marathon and it was crucial United stopped the rot, and they did in Croydon after a concerning first half.",
      "Read the full report here >>>",
      "Senne Lammens",
      "Made a few saves you would expect him to make in the first half, but he was the pick of a bad bunch in the opening 45 minutes. 6",
      "Leny Yoro",
      "Had another bad game. Yoro got away with a blunder when Mateta failed to finish and appeared to redeem himself with an important block, but he made a clumsy challenge to concede the penalty. 3",
      "Matthijs de Ligt",
      "Mateta is an old-school centre-forward and asked questions of De Ligt from the first whistle, winning the physical battle and pulling him out of position. Looked more comfortable in the second half. 5",
      "Read the ratings here>>>",
      "That's it, United hold on for a big three points. Zirkzee and Mount with the goals in the second half win it.",
      "Devenny hits it and into the wall",
      "Hughes is brought down by Casemiro in a dangerous position",

      "Wharton, Pino OFF",
      "Hughes, Uche ON",
      "Zirkzee and Mbeumo nearly trip each other up, eventually the latter has a go but it is easily saved. United will hope these misses don't come back to haunt them.",
      "The ball ends up falling to Dalot on the edge but it is well over the bar",
      "Mazraoui rolls Guehi and is brought down by the Palace man, booking given and now a dangerous free kick to come.",
      "Shaw is booked for a foul but United aren't happy. Dalot looked to be fouled at the other end of the pitch by Richards moments before.",
      "Deep ball into the area is flicked on by Nketiah but the ball drops wide.",
      "De Ligt clatters Mateta as they go for the ball and the free kick is given.",

      "GOAL UNITED. Mason Mount. Fernandes over a free kick after Dalot was fouled. He steps up and lays it off for Mount to fire in!",
      "Mateta gets some luck and charges towards goal but he fires it over the bar",
      "This is where United's fresh legs could count. Palace feeling the effects of midweek and the Reds look the better team. If they can grab another, it would be impressive.",

The season is a marathon and it was crucial United stopped the rot, and they did in Croydon after a concerning first half.",
      "United had won just one of their last 11 Premier League away games - against Liverpool at Anfield last month. Speaking during the pre-match press conference, Amorim admitted he didn't know why his team struggles on the road, but he said that his players need to learn how to \"finish games\".",
      "Amorim axed Patrick Dorgu from his starting line-up following his admission that he senses \"anxiety\" from the defender when he's on the ball. Diogo Dalot came into the team, but the Portugal international has also been unconvincing at left wing-back this season.",
      "Shea Lacey, 18, was the only attacking option on the bench. Kobbie Mainoo has played as a No.10 in Amorim's system, but the United boss has confirmed he views him as a deep midfielder. Only Arsenal (six) had conceded fewer goals than Palace (nine) in the Premier League this season, and United had been hopeless in the final third against Everton earlier in the week.",
      "But United still had no excuse not to pose a threat on Sunday. Palace were in European action against Strasbourg in France on Thursday, meaning they had just two days to prepare, compared to United's five days of preparation at Carrington, so the Reds rocked up to Selhurst Park with an immediate advantage.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo gave Amad a pat on the back as the players returned to the dressing room to prepare for kick-off. Amad assisted Mbeumo against Liverpool and Tottenham, and it felt like their relationship could be key again. As it turned out, United managed to claim a win despite the pair not being at their best.",
      "Dalot contributed more in the first 30 seconds than Dorgu had in 58 minutes against Everton, launching a long throw-in into the box, which Casemiro remarkably did not find the net from.",
      "The away section belted out '12 Days of Cantona' for two obvious reasons: December is now just around the corner and United were playing at the scene of the infamous kung fu kick.",
      "Amorim looked frustrated as Palace began to carve out opportunities. He paced up and down the touchline and was reminded by the fourth official to stay within his area. Then Mbeumo was shown a yellow card for throwing the ball to the ground, clearly frustrated at how the game was unfolding.",
      "Adam Wharton sent a shot straight at Senne Lammens from the edge of the box, Jean-Philippe Mateta missed a sitter after a mistake from Yoro, and Yeremy Pino was stunned to see his effort blocked by Yoro in a later move. Yoro managed to redeem himself for his blunder leading to Mateta's chance.",
      "Mateta continued to ask questions. He bullied Matthijs de Ligt and drew another mistake from Yoro, who needlessly fouled him in the box from a position that was never going to yield a clean challenge.",
      "The penalty was converted - but there was a double touch and VAR ordered it to be retaken. That rule needs to change because the opponent should not be given another bite at the cherry after botching the first penalty. Nonetheless, Mateta scored his second penalty.",
      "\"Boom, boom, boom, boom, Mateta's in the room\" was chanted twice to the tune of the Vengaboys hit. The double embarrassment should have sparked a response, but the white shirts limped into the interval. Amad and Mbeumo were not at the races, and United do not tend to fire when the pair underperform.",
      "Luke Shaw shook his head as the whistle went for half-time. Shaw has been at United for 11 years and was making just his 300th appearance for the club. The defender has played for five permanent managers during his time at Old Trafford and might have been close to playing for another if the Reds had not completed a comeback. There will not be another inquest come on Monday morning.",
      "Amorim made two changes and both had the desired effect. Dalot had a great game and Mason Mount finished brilliantly to fire United into a 2-1 lead. It was a brave decision from Amorim to stick with Joshua Zirkzee, but even that call was vindicated by the Dutchman's well-taken half-volley to equalise.",
      "Zirkzee's shot had to be powerful to beat Dean Henderson - and it was. Zirkzee has not looked like a striker since his arrival from Bologna, but he will be alright if he can score more goals like that for United.",
      "The Everton performance was shocking and Amorim needed to produce an answer. He did.",

      "The Reds are now level with Arsenal with the joint-most set-piece goals in the top flight this season, having scored 10 goals from set-play scenarios just 13 games into the campaign.",
      "Amorim was asked whether United had put more work into set-pieces during training, and he said: \"No, we work a lot. We have more time to work, we work a lot and we learn a lot in England.",
      "\"I think you are used to seeing that, but when you come for the Premier League you learn a lot with other teams how to do it and we are stealing a lot of things to score goals. \"",
      "Amorim discussed what he said to the players at half-time, saying: \"It's just to understand for everyone to understand the game. I felt in the last ten minutes of the first half, I felt that the opponent was struggling and they would struggle in the second half. We had that feeling that we needed to do something to change the way we were playing.",
      "\"And it was that, of course. We tried to change little things in the game. But the intensity and the quality in the way we connect, especially Josh in our connection, was better and that improves a lot the way we play.\"",
      "When asked whether he believed United could turn the game around, he said: \"I felt that because I had the feeling that if you see the last plays of the game, they were struggling so much to take the ball out of the box and you can feel it the way they move.",
      "\"They were getting tired for the second half and we talked about that. And again, our pace in the first half, intensity, we cannot play like that in the Premier League. So we increased that and I had the feeling that if we score one goal this is going to change completely.",
      "\"I really like also the way we controlled the game with the ball, winning the game. So we were in front but we were not afraid of trying to score the next one and to control the ball in their half.\"",
      "Amorim believes the lack of intensity in the first half was due to 'small details'. \"Sometimes it's a lot of things,\" he added. \"Sometimes you don't need to move but the pace of the ball can be better.",
      "\"You need to understand that Mateta was the man that had the time to think and if you see in the second half, sometimes it was him that starts the play. All these small details I think we improved. And when you have one play, two plays, the rhythm flows better and you increase everything mentally and physically.\"",

      "Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has opened up about the shock he felt upon learning of his dismissal as Manchester United manager.",
      "The ex-United boss took over the reins at Old Trafford in December 2018, stepping in after Jose Mourinho's departure. He was then awarded the permanent role in March 2019, following a string of successful results - a position he held until his sacking in November 2021.",
      "Solskjaer, who had an 11-year stint as a player at United, presided over a summer of significant expenditure in his last transfer window, which saw Cristiano Ronaldo make a sensational return to Manchester.",
      "The £72million signing of Jadon Sancho stirred excitement among fans, while Real Madrid defender Raphael Varane was brought in after a decade in Spain. United kicked off the 2021/22 season on a high note, securing victories in four of their first five Premier League matches.",
      "However, things started to unravel for Solskjaer as United suffered five losses in their subsequent seven games, leaving them languishing in seventh place. A crushing 4-1 defeat to Watford proved to be the final straw for the Norwegian, with his dismissal announced the next day.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "Reflecting on his unceremonious exit from Manchester four years later, Solskjaer told the BBC that while his departure was justified, it did little to ease the disappointment he experienced when he was informed of his termination.",
      "Speaking to Kelly Somers, the 52-year-old reflected on his tenure at Old Trafford: \"That pressure is a privilege because I was allowed to do that and I was allowed to deal with it in my way and that was [by] having great staff around us.",
      "\"[The] environment in and around the club was very positive. But in the end, it doesn't matter if you enjoy coming to work everyday, you need results. We unfortunately had a very bad six-week spell and that's too long at a club like Man United and they made a change, which is fine.",
      "\"It was sad, we lost to Watford of course and I knew this was more or less the end. [I] drove my family to the airport, they went back to Norway actually and I was going to work. I got a text, 'Ole, I need to see you in my office', and I knew what was going to happen so I rang my wife straight away.",
      "\"'I'll be back, I'll catch you up', I said. I think it's sudden but not surprising. If you don't get results, you do make a change in football but I felt we had something going.\"",
      "Accepting the United position represents an intimidating challenge at any point, particularly for someone like Solskjaer who had never managed in England's top division before taking the role.",
      "However, even for the most experienced managers, the position proved overwhelmingly demanding, the Norwegian admitted. During the BBC interview, he revealed that then-Everton manager Carlo Ancelotti confided during a match between the sides that he wouldn't fancy the United job.",
      "Boasting a CV that includes Juventus, AC Milan, Chelsea, Paris Saint-Germain, Real Madrid and Bayern Munich, the Italian's statement was quite significant. Solskjaer recalled: \"I remember one game - Everton. Stood there in my technical area.",
      "\"Carlo Ancelotti comes across, so he's more or less in my technical area. Fourth official says, 'Carlo, you need to go back into your technical area, unless you want Ole's job.' And he said 'no, no, no, too much pressure.",
      "\"That job is too much pressure'. You know pressure is a privilege, he's always said that as well, and I felt privileged to be the manager of Man Utd, but of course, you're the face of everyone, everything surrounding Man Utd.\"",

      "Ruben Amorim praised Joshua Zirkzee and Diogo Dalot following Manchester United's 2-1 comeback victory against Crystal Palace in the Premier League. Zirkzee brought United level at the start of the second half with a well-taken half-volley. Then Mason Mount fired United into the lead, finding the bottom corner from a set-piece routine.",
      "Amorim stuck by Zirkzee after a disappointing performance against Everton, and he made the decision to recall Dalot to the starting team after moving him to the bench on Monday night. Both Zirkzee and Dalot were praised during Amorim's post-match press conference.",
      "\"It was really important,\" said Amorim of Zirkzee's goal. \"But again, it was not just the goal, even the runs behind. In the first half he struggled on the duels and he won some duels in the second half. We improved a lot because of the quality of Josh in the second half. That is important for him to understand. That is not just the goal. We play better because Josh played better in the second half.\"",
      "Bryan Mbeumo drifted closer to Zirkzee in the second half. \"I didn't say 'go near Josh',\" Amorim said. \"I just said to the players we need to be more alive and you can feel that. So if you are more alive, you are in more places, you are near the ball more often. I think everyone did that.",
      "\"But we also need to understand that the opponent was tired also in the second half. And when you increase the rhythm and the opponent gets tired a little bit, suffers right away a goal, you felt that we had the control of the game and that's it.\"",
      "Amorim was critical of his options at left wing-back at his pre-match press conference on Friday, and admitted he was pleased with the response from Dalot at Selhurst Park. When asked whether Dalot's display was the benchmark for a player in that role, Amorim said: \"It's of course defending and attacking. If you have certain characteristics, the pace, you can go right or left because you also can play with your left.",
      "\"You need to use that in every single game in the Premier League and not just one game and then we drop a little bit the level. But it's the same thing that I said with Patrick.",
      "\"I know they have a lot of quality. They just need to be relaxed sometimes and show that and show the intensity and the pace that they have.\"",

      "Barcelona's sporting director Deco has suggested Marcus Rashford was burdened with excessive responsibility \"too young\" - which ultimately contributed to his difficulties at Manchester United.",
      "The 28-year-old, currently on loan with the Catalan club, emerged as a teenage sensation a decade ago but has struggled to consistently perform season-on-season at Old Trafford, leaving his long-term future uncertain. He made his breakthrough under Louis van Gaal in 2016 - netting twice on his European debut.",
      "Rashford's reputation soared rapidly, yet he has already served under five permanent bosses in Manchester and, from an early age, was viewed as one of the squad's key figures. He frequently found himself amongst the first to face criticism when the team underperformed.",
      "Ruben Amorim seemed to question Rashford's commitment and he is now on his second temporary move away from Manchester, with Deco arguing he has been compelled to shoulder too much responsibility whilst the persistent instability has created problems.",
      "He told The Times: \"He's happy with us. Marcus is a fantastic player. He faced the responsibility of becoming an important player at Man United - United, like us, are one of the biggest clubs in the world - too young.",
      "\"He suffered a bit with this change of generation at United too. If you see United in the last five years, they had difficulties rebuilding the team, to become stronger again.",
      "\"He was there. So it's not easy for a player [from whom] people demand a lot. When you are an important player, you have a lot of responsibility.",
      "\"We were looking for a player like him on the market. A player that could play in the three positions up front.",
      "\"We were able to sign Marcus on loan now because of his desire to play for Barcelona. He waited a lot. He knew that we were dealing with financial rules. But he was patient. He waited and we're happy to have him.\"",
      "It's yet to be determined whether Rashford's move to Barcelona will become a permanent one, although there is an option in his loan agreement. Despite a wealth of talent in Catalunya, Rashford has still proved a valuable addition, scoring an impressive double on his return to England against Newcastle earlier this season.",
      "The United loanee has found the back of the net six times during his loan spell and appears to have regained his form. With his childhood club, he has experienced significant highs, including a season where he reached the 30-goal mark, but has also faced harsh criticism when things haven't gone as expected.",

      "After starting Monday's 1-0 defeat at home to Everton, Dorgu dropped down to the bench for the trip to Palace. However, he still managed to get some game time, replacing Amad Diallo in stoppage-time.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "Amorim decided to go for Diogo Dalot at left wing-back with Amad on the other side. Leny Yoro, Matthijs de Ligt and Luke Shaw made up the back-three with Mount, Bryan Mbeumo and Zirkzee up front.",
      "Amorim's decision came after comments he made in a press conference regarding Dorgu and the contrast in performances for his country, Denmark, and United.",
      "\"When I see them training they are doing so much better than in games,\" Amorim said. \"Then Patrick, when I see him playing for the national team, he’s scored a great goal against Scotland, the decision that he made under pressure was completely different to the decision('s) he’s making in our team.",
      "\"You can feel the anxiety every time Patrick touches the ball. \"I can feel it, the anxiety.\"",
      "It was Bruno Fernandes who stole the show against Palace, assisting both Zirkzee and Mount as United recorded a first win since October. Casemiro started alongside him in midfield with Senne Lammens completing the XI in goal.",
      "Reflecting on his side's win, Amorim cut a relieved figure. When asked if he said anything at half-time to prompt a reaction from his United team, the Portuguese said: \"No, we just wanted everyone to understand the game.",
      "\"I felt in the last 10 minutes of the first half that the opponent was struggling, and that they would struggle in the second half. We had that feeling, and we needed to do something to change the way we were playing.",

      "\"It was massive,\" Fernandes, meanwhile told MUTV, when asked how big the win was for United. \"We needed the three points after the performance and the result we had last week.",
      "\"We needed a response very quickly. I think first half was not great for us, but the second half was a very big response.\"",

      "Senne Lammens wore a polo shirt and a navy sweatshirt when he visited Old Trafford after signing for Manchester United. The young goalkeeper looked as though he could be joining United to work in their HR department.",
      "The same observation was made when Lammens reported for international duty with Belgium last week - the 23-year-old was dressed in a beige collared jacket, a khaki t-shirt and chinos.",
      "\"By accident, I saw an article saying he was wearing something boring when he reported for international duty and fans saying they hoped he stays like this,\" laughed Hayk Milkon, one of Lammens' former coaches.",
      "\"This 'boringness' is just the way Senne is, he's really calm and no excesses. He focuses on what he needs to focus on and is open with the people around him. He keeps his feet on the ground.\"",
      "If Lammens looks like someone who could work in an office, every workplace would love to have him in their five-a-side team. United believe they have signed a young goalkeeper with huge potential, and fans who were present at Old Trafford against Sunderland left the stadium buzzing about his debut.",
      "The quirk is that Lammens appears to be a different person when he wears his goalkeeper kit. He made a supremely confident United debut, aggressively commanded his area and kept a clean sheet.",
      "Milkon coached Lammens during their time together at Club Brugge. Milkon is now the youngest manager in the Belgian top-flight and Lammens plays for the biggest club in England.",
      "\"It was Senne with his headphones on. He would go into the gym to do his recovery or some extra top-ups. Or he would just go to relax by playing basketball - he loved to play basketball.\"",
      "Milkon coached in different roles at Club Brugge. He was the assistant of Club NXT (their reserve team), served as their interim manager, was in charge of the Under-18s and eventually became a first-team coach.",
      "His time at Club Brugge coincided with Lammens progressing from the academy to their first team, so he is uniquely positioned to provide insight into United's new goalkeeper signing.",
      "Lammens joined Club Brugge's academy when he was 12. \"He was a guy with huge potential,\" said Milkon. \"As I learned from colleagues who had worked with him when he was much younger, I heard there was a moment that clicked in his head when he became super professional.",
      "\"He was one of the guys during Covid - when the players were not able to train - who was doing a lot at home, he was really going far with this to be the best in these types of areas.",
      "\"Then he continued like this when he joined the first team to train with them. He always wanted to improve. We also had something in place to look at the parameters on which goalkeepers are judged.",
      "\"You see the potential of the goalkeeper based on what they do in games; so their positioning, their decision-making and so on, and Senne was always quite high in these areas.",
      "\"The only bad luck that he had was that the first-team goalkeeper was Simon Mignolet. He's an amazing goalkeeper, so it was difficult for Senne to stay over there in the role of No.2.",
      "\"That would have also blocked his growth, so it was good for him in the end to make the step to go to Antwerp and he did a tremendous job there. It was amazing to see how fast he adapted.\"",
      "Milkon continued: \"I think for us at Club Brugge, it was very clear to everyone that Senne was a top goalkeeper. He would have been the perfect fit for Club Brugge to be the No.1.",
      "\"That was not possible because Mignolet was there. But the parameters that we used to judge his performances indicated he was ticking so many boxes already, and he was consistently doing it.",
      "\"There weren't ups and downs with his performances. He was consistently really high and when you compare this to the top goalkeepers, you have a benchmark to say 'Ok, what potential does this guy have?'",
      "\"He had some chances with the first team at Club Brugge and made a mistake, or maybe two, but in the end it was very clear to everyone that he was a top goalkeeper.",
      "\"It was impossible to try to extend his contract because, again, you have Mignolet, and you cannot block a guy like this. You know he has to go out, he has to play, and he will improve even more.\"",
      "When asked about Lammens' strengths, he said: \"I would say that his decision-making was very good. He is very calm, he sees the solutions on the pitch, he has a quick reaction time and understands the balance between risk and reward, and which decisions are the right ones to make.",
      "\"His clean passing is great, his footwork was really good, and he's just an amazing goalkeeper with the shot-stopping. He made some incredible saves back then already. He's quite a complete goalkeeper.",
      "\"But making the right decisions at a very young age, being very mature with this, was really impressive. And the fact that he is good with both feet is another big strength.",
      "\"For me, Senne is a very calm guy and has all the qualities to be a top professional. That was my impression when I first met him when he was younger and he never changed.\"",
      "Lammens joined Royal Antwerp on a free transfer in the summer of 2023. He was handed his debut a few months later and served as an understudy that season, but earned first-choice status for 2024/2025.",
      "His performances drew attention from the Belgian media. Lammens saved four penalties across a successful first full campaign and received a call-up to Belgium's senior squad in March.",
      "Milkon said: \"I was not surprised when I saw Manchester United had come calling. And to record his first clean sheet, I was really happy for him. Senne is a potential No.1 for the Red Devils - the Belgium national team.",
      "\"He got his chance, he took it, and we're all really proud of him, but we knew it would happen. I believe he has all the capabilities to become the best in the world, so I wish him all the best. I'm sure he will have a very good career in England, and Manchester United should return to the big club they used to be.",
      "\"He will have a positive impact on that, for sure, and hopefully he will be Belgium's first-choice goalkeeper soon. I believe he has the potential, the skillset and the personality to do that.",
      "\"For me, it was just having a tiny little part in having an influence on him at Brugge, but it was the most positive memories of our relationship that we had during this spell.",
      "\"I'm very proud that he is reaching these high levels and not surprised. I believe he will be successful because he is a guy who will not change his focus or start to do something different. He is calm, that's his personality and character, and he wants to succeed. He is hungry and will keep working to be his best.",
      "\"He is so calm, and you have to be patient in football. You cannot worry too much and want things too early, but finding the balance between not being impatient and, at the same time, pushing and demanding what you deserve in a good way, means everything will sort itself out.\"",
      "United staff who have worked with Lammens at Carrington have echoed Milkon's sentiments. He has been described as \"really mature for his age\" and is said to have taken the move in his stride.",
      "Lammens is understood to have impressed coaches during training sessions and a United source said that lots of people have been speaking positively about him. He has already relocated from the luxury hotel where he was initially staying and into a house.",
      "It's no surprise that Lammens likes to play basketball at 6ft 3in, but he is a keen golfer, which is common ground with the likes of Tom Heaton, Luke Shaw, Mason Mount and Harry Maguire.",
      "Matthijs de Ligt, Amad, Maguire and Shaw jogged straight to Lammens to congratulate him after full-time against Sunderland. \"Are you Schmeichel in disguise?\" was chanted at Lammens from the Stretford End.",
      "It remains to be seen whether Lammens will start against Liverpool on Sunday, but it would be a surprise to see him on the bench after delivering a strong debut before the international break.",
      "There would be nothing boring about keeping another clean sheet - this time at Anfield.",
      "Kitbag has slashed the price of Man United kits and merch with up to 65% off select items.",

      "Send your thoughts to theeditor@football365.com.",
      "Just to reply to Mat’s mail in Monday afternoon’s (or late morning here!) mailbox about Paqueta sending off.",
      "Specifically Mat mentions ‘Jarred Bowen as captain was oddly passive about the whole thing’ , which having seen (only) the highlights I tend to agree with – he wan;t really getting involved at all.",
      "If anything the Liverpool goalkeeper Allison was the one player trying to get him to shut up and f**k off away from the referee! I presume this is because they are both Brazilian and speak the same language and have maybe been in international squads together, and therefore Allison didn’t want to see him get himself sent off.",
      "I appreciate that Paqueta has raised the investigation into his off field activities and lack of psychological support as issues. I do not know if this was meant to be mitigation for his sending off and I also do not know how this may have affected him.",
      "In my mind Allison shouldn’t get involved if an opponent is going to get  / wants to be sent off if it is going to give his struggling team something of an advantage!",

      "",
      "Good Day",
      "Just some responses to today’s mailbox. Firstly Mr Garey Vance. He says that Amorim used his halftime talk to inspire urgency. Fair point but that undermines the “whole coaching them all week” point you made. What was he coaching them? Because it wasn’t urgency against a team that played in Europe on Thursday. We were the team who looked like we had played in midweek such was our apparent apathy and lack of urgency. Why do we need to sacrifice a whole half for the manager to get this team to do what he had a whole week to prepare for?",
      "Also if looking at your bench and choosing the only non-youth team player who can play striker because of an injury is management then I’m expecting a call up any day now. I will concede that the Mount pick was good but again those two goals came from two moments of individual genius from dead ball situations. Like I said up until the 76th-ish minute the only touch we had in the opposition box was Zirkzee’s goal.",
      "And this domination you’re talking about was not part of the game I watched because we were under siege in the last ten minutes or so and Opta (however much weight you’d like to give them) showed that except for 15 minutes, it was Palace who were the more threatening team. We were lucky not to be 3-0 down at half time with Mateta just squeezing one wide and that Palace shot from a long throw in that went straight at Lammens.",
      "Sorry mate. I really do want to celebrate a United win but this win had some SERIOUS caveats attached to it and we as United fans shouldn’t be happy with a band aid victory after that Everton defeat where Amorim REFUSED to change shape and left us with 5 at the back against ten men.",
      "Andreas Hasle makes some excellent points and I agree with almost his whole email. One thing I absolutely agree has to be changed in the PL and football in general is the after shot tackle as he mentions about Konsa. How a player is allowed to absolutely plough into an attacker and face no censure after the player has taken his shot is completely ridiculous. I don’t know why it’s allowed and honestly it’s ridiculous and dangerous. But I suppose asking for refereeing consistency and accountability is tilting at windmills in the extreme",
      "All the respect in the world to Ed and my fellow mailboxers. Have a great week\nDisgruntled (Anonymous as is my right. Thank you very much) RSA",
      "",
      "Tommy Frank. As I watched his soon to be last days at Brentford, all wild-eyed, furiously chewing gum but completely relaxed, half listening to whichever coach was talking in his ear, total master of his wee domain – bored even – I thought he looks ready for ‘The Step Up’.",
      "Fast forward to now, and he’s a nervous wreck who looks like he has actually physically shrunk. Confusion written all over his face at Spence & Roadrunner ignoring him. STARTING with damage limitation as his NLD masterplan. Picking a fight with the fans for god’s sake!",
      "Arne Slot, despite finally beating someone (a self flagellating West Ham, wonder how much Paqueta had on his red card…), is still only visible because of his bald dome just about breaking the surface of the deep end.",
      "Or Spain, where Xabi Alonso is having to deal with used to be mustard manchild Vini Jr leading a dressing room revolt because….ummm……he’s a spoilt little pr*ck?",
      "Different levels of prior achievement to land their jobs, and different records thus far, but all catapulted waaaaaaay higher than their last jobs, and all struggling.",
      "(Convoluted) point is, seems to me that football’s impatient culture in 2025 is in danger of preventing a new generation of managers becoming an Ancelotti, or a Sacchi, or a ‘insert elder statesman of choice here’.",
      "Even Arsenal, who have displayed a ton of patience with Legohead as he slowly and painfully learned what to do with attacking players, like the ape in 2001 finally lobbing that femur into the air – which, coincidentally, he resembled on the touchline v Chelsea as they dropped two points, squealing and windmilling away – doesn’t really count here given the levels of wedge deployed to provide him with 4,629 players for every position with which to inch towards winning something significant. Anything Mikel. Please.",
      "Football is eating itself anyway, as anything of value tends to when the big money ghouls and their front men appear to pillage and ruin it (hi Gianni!), but if there’s no managers allowed to develop a bit of gravitas and experience before taking the big jobs, or even – heaven forbid – when IN said jobs, we’ll be in an even sorrier state IMO. Thoughts?\nRHT/TS x",

      "What a win on Saturday for Newcastle. Everton were poor but this version of Newcastle hasn’t shown up on the road for so long. I wondered before the game if having two away matches back-to-back would help – all other recent losses away have been followed by a home match, so the tired line was repeated about ‘putting things right’ which you can’t do by retreating back to your comfort zone. We’ll never know but psychologically I wonder if going straight to another hostile stadium and tough opponent was what changed the mentality from seeking comfort to sharpening focus.",
      "The Pope decision being taken out of Howe’s hands due to injury was helpful. Burn being trusted at CB showed us again that he is an outstanding defender in the right position, but that cannot be full back where Hall was excellent and brings so much to the attack that Burn cannot. Thiaw is just in that kind of form top CBs can get into – imperious in defence but in the right place in attack – peak Van Dijk, Dias & Gabriel have shown how much impact that kind of defender can have at both ends of the pitch, we have to keep him fit.",
      "Miley took a lot of ball playing stress off Bruno who looked like Home Bruno in this outing. I wasn’t reading too much into Tonali not playing as he needs a rest but if Bruno is left to do all the playmaking we’ve seen that doesn’t work, Miley helped balance that and Joelinton was very impressive in the 2nd half. Now we know we can rotate in midfield we need to see more of it.",
      "Woltemade’s finish was filthy, but like the City game he played better overall, had more chances and if anything looks more of a threat than those earlier games where he was scoring maybe from one chance. And Elanga gave what was comfortably his best performance. He should have done better with that first chance in the first few seconds of the game, but tactically he was very good and that was key to a very good team performance. Getting his first assist will help I’m sure.",
      "Only downside is how dependent we are on Hall and Livramento staying fit in order to play as we did against Everton and against City. Lovely when they are together but if either is out our other options at FB cannot offer the same mobility, drive and dynamism. We need another left back as Burn should not be the first choice back up.",
      "What I love about Howe is that he does change things. He might wait a bit too long and he seems reactive rather than proactive, but he will adapt. Contrast that with Amorim who won’t change a thing regardless of circumstances and I can only give my opinion that Howe will outlast Amorim as a top coach. I wrote in a couple of weeks ago saying this period will make or break the season and Howe’s reputation and I stand by that, but we’ve got a home match against a Spurs team who are at a very low ebb tomorrow, win that and its three league wins back-to-back, with another home game against Burnley at the weekend.\nJames, Leeds",
      "",
      "I felt sorry for Gary Lineker when he lost his cushy gig at the Beeb. MOTD isn’t the same without his charm. Just like Two and a Half Men wasn’t the same after Charlie Sheen was fired for using Tiger’s Blood and erm, WINNING.",
      "But Lineker’s comments regarding Caicedo’s deserved red card is absolute codswallop. I now understand why his “disciplinary” record is so spotless. Back in his days, being thuggish and brutish was an acceptable means of showing your presence on the field. I felt sick to my stomach reading his bizarre comments. I now understand why they fired his @$$…\nMuthama Gitonga, Nyeri (Mount Kenya)",
      "",
      "This may not hit home with a lot of readers but I actually thought the referee had a decent game on Sunday.",
      "He let a lot of the play go, ignored lots of Villa (and Wolves) players falling to the floor and had the bottle to ignore VAR calling for a red card where there blatantly wasn’t one.",
      "For what it’s worth it was a foul in the build up to Villa goal but there was also lots of other Wolves players who could have closed down and didn’t.",
      "I think Wolves are doomed but I’m a Huddersfield fan who is engaged to a Wolves fan so am looking forward to away trips next season.\nSara HTFC",
      "Lucas Paqueta is not getting any sympathy even from the woke folk while Arsenal fans do not really know how to feel.",
      "Thomas Frank lands himself another spot in the losers alongside Lucas Paqueta, Bournemouth and Everton. How they all wish they could be Sunderland.",
      "Three teams have been picked for more Premier League TV games than Arsenal, Liverpool and Chelsea this season. Manchester United, obviously, but also…",
      "Fans always think their ‘system’ has finally clicked when in reality they’re just playing West Ham. But also Joe Gomez is the truth for Liverpool.",
      "Jordan Henderson really did make an absolute hash of his Liverpool exit, but two years and some atrocious career moves later he is back and relevant again.",
      "Arne Slot produced a tactical masterclass to get Liverpool a much-needed win: dropping Mo Salah, picking a right-back and above all, playing against West Ham."

      "They need an upgrade on Scott McTominay, who’s consistently proved himself not quite good enough for a club that still stands alone as The Greatest In English Football History, and for Casemiro, who’s just been told to “leave the football before the football leaves you” by Jamie Carragher.",
      "Names are put forward, but all pale in comparison to a man who’s who’s not good enough for PSG but is still very good (promise), as proven by him thriving at Sporting under a manager not yet attractive enough to unseat Erik ten Hag at Old Trafford.",
      "Burnley’s Sander Berge and Wolves’ Joao Gomes are on their radar, but chief among the alternatives is Atalanta star Ederson. If only the Serie A side weren’t asking for just as much as PSG want for an evidently superior midfielder in Ugarte.",
      "In quite the catalogue of midfield recriminations at Manchester United, the summer of 2024 is a doozy. Pushing McTominay to Napoli for him to be named Serie A MVP while winning the Scudetto and signing Ugarte in his stead is extraordinarily poor judgement by their own extraordinarily low standards.",
      "Eventually PSG dropped their price for Ugarte to what was at the time thought to be a €50m bargain but has since proven to be a gross overpayment for a footballer who’s at best a midfield passenger rather than the fighter the United hierarchy were hoping for, and more often than not an ally to opposition teams in their routine bypassing of the Red Devils midfield.",
      "But United have now been offered an opportunity to right that landmark wrong and sign Ederson, albeit a glimmer of one owing to the Brazilian’s almost comically bolshy agent making no bones about the preferred destination for his client, whose contract expires in 2027.",
      "“It’s an opportunity because his contract is expiring,” Andre Cury said. “His side didn’t want to sell him despite very high offers. I think they will do it in this January window or in the summer.",
      "“Atalanta were asking for a lot of money, between 60 and 75 million euros, but now his contract is almost up, they could even halve the price, between 30 and 40 million.",
      "“He’s a spectacular player with some of the best statistics in Europe for his position.”",
      "“I’m friends with Deco and the Barcelona president. I do my job. I will always help them with transfers because I have a very special affection for Barcelona.”",
      "A man claiming “I do my job” before immediately revealing he “will always help” Barcelona with transfers is someone very evidently not doing his job of working on the best outcome for his client. But that, along with this pretty grim come-and-get-me-plea 18 months out from Ederson’s contract expiry, suggests Cury could perhaps be encouraged (if you catch our drift) to vote in favour of a move to Old Trafford.",
      "And at, say, €35m [£31m], Ederson would be well worth the outlay for a football club currently regretting him being the alternative rather than the top target 18 months ago.",
      "Manchester United head coach Ruben Amorim has admitted that one of his players is “struggling”, while he has opened the door to two transfers.",
      "Manchester United have a problem player, but his mooted ‘surprise’ January replacement has the joint-worst record in Europe’s top five leagues this season.",
      "Man Utd head coach Ruben Amorim reportedly called out Manuel Ugarte in front of his team-mates for letting ‘his work rate slide’.",
      "£51m midfielder Manuel Ugarte is clearly hurting Man Utd, not helping them. The statistics don’t lie and supporters are losing patience.",
      "According to reports, two ‘struggling’ Manchester United stars face being offloaded next year, while the Red Devils could seal a bargain transfer.",
      "Man Utd face ‘decision time’ on the futures of Kobbie Mainoo, Manuel Ugarte and Harry Maguire, according to transfer expert Fabrizio Romano."

      "Rio Ferdinand has urged Kobbie Mainoo to be “razor sharp” for the Manchester United game time he won’t be handed by Ruben Amorim in the next few weeks.",
      "Mainoo has featured for just 261 minutes for United this season as he plays the most second of second fiddles to Bruno Fernandes in midfield. The captain’s position alongside a more typical defensive midfielder – Casemiro as thing stand – in the double pivot is the only role Amorim sees Mainoo playing in, and what we’ve seen in recent games suggests not even AFCON will offer the academy graduate the football he needs.",
      "The imminent departures of Bryan Mbeumo and Amad Diallo has been seen as Mainoo’s golden opportunity to play and stake a claim for a more permanent spot in Amorim’s starting XI, and Ferdinand still believes that to be the case.",
      "“If I’m Kobbie Mainoo now I’m probably sitting there for the last couple of weeks, I’m going to get myself razor sharp, majorly fit and ready for when the African Nations hits,” Ferdinand said on his podcast.",
      "“Because if I don’t get in the team, then what is going on?",
      "“The manager could easily, easily move Bruno even into the false nine if Sesko is not fit. He’s done that before. If Cunha is not fit as well, he can move Bruno to the left and play Kobbie in the midfield.",
      "“I think it’s a big, big few weeks for Kobbie Mainoo in determining how he feels about his role at the football club, how he feels about staying or going.",
      "“These next few weeks are going to be telling in that department. So watch this space.”",
      "There’s a whole lot of “ifs” in there and we’ve essentially seen a dry run for AFCON in the last two games. With two forwards – Matheus Cunha and Benjamin Sesko – not available to play, Mainoo has still only played 32 minutes off the bench in the defeat to Everton, and came on in the last minute in the victory over Crystal Palace.",
      "With Cunha posting a picture of himself in training with the caption ‘back back back’ and Joshua Zirkzee coming up trumps in that win over Palace with a very fine finish, the nailed-on front three when Mbeumo and Amad depart will see Mason Mount and Cunha either side of Zirkzee, who may or may not drop out of the team when Sesko returns from injury in a couple of weeks’ time.",
      "A report last week claimed Mainoo has ‘said yes’ to Napoli ahead of the January transfer window and the Serie A side are ‘growing positive’ about securing his services, with Mainoo is said to be ‘specifically open to a loan deal’.",
      "And even if Mainoo was given ample opportunity over the Christmas period to prove his worth to United, there’s simply no way he will retain a spot in the team ahead of Mbeumo when he returns or Cunha in one of those inverted No.10 spots.",
      "Because as Amorim has already made very clear, he doesn’t see Mainoo as a player for one of those positions. It’s him or Bruno Fernandes, and it will always be Bruno Fernandes.",
      "Manchester United legend Rio Ferdinand has claimed Arsenal star Bukayo Saka is “unplayable” after the Gunners’ 1-1 draw at Chelsea on Sunday.",
      "England international Kobbie Mainoo is reportedly edging closer to leaving Manchester United, who have already ‘sealed’ a January signing.",
      "According to reports, Manchester United are still backing Ruben Amorim as they are preparing to let eight players leave and make four priority signings.",
      "Manchester United star Kobbie Mainoo has been told that he should be “furious” at Ruben Amorim as he is in a “horrible” situation at Old Trafford.",

      "Man Utd are offering ‘a fixed fee of €100 million plus €20 million in add-ons to try and lure one of the most complete, physically imposing, and decisive players in world football away from Real Madrid’.",
      "The €120m (£105m) fee would be a record-breaking deal for the Red Devils, whose biggest ever purchase was the £89m they paid to Juventus for Paul Pogba in 2016, and INEOS and Sir Jim Ratcliffe ‘want to build a project with Valverde as its cornerstone and don’t hesitate to place him among the most expensive signings in the club’s history.’",
      "There could be a lot of change at Man Utd over the next couple of transfer windows as the Red Devils look to cut their current wage bill – but former Man City financial adviser Stefan Borson doubts it will reduced as much as some think.",
      "Borson told Football Insider: “I don’t think United are going to cut £100m off the wage bill. Wage bills always come down slower than people think. United have already cut the wage bill quite aggressively.",
      "“Every team has got players who are surplus to requirements who you go, ‘Well, of course, we’ll sell these players in the summer and then the wage bill will just collapse and we’ll have a tiny wage bill’. It just never works that way.",

      "“There’s an interesting situation with Sancho.",
      "“I think he’s got a one-year option that United talked about exercising, but they probably won’t exercise it, so maybe he’ll go for free.",
      "“I think they will probably sell Mainoo, but then that’s more of a profit and not really a massive wage saving because he won’t be on top-tier wages.",
      "“They’ll probably end up keeping Casemiro rather than shipping him out. They’ll probably end up keeping Bruno Fernandes. They’ll probably end up doing a deal to keep Maguire. They might be on reduced salaries, but they’re not going to go to zero. They’ll just trim 25 per cent off.”",

      "But let’s be honest: you’re only here to see which arbitrary section Arsenal have been put in so you can properly word the furious comments that will never be read.",
      "",
      "Chelsea indiscipline probably ought to be addressed at some point but the genuine growth and maturity in their manager and players in such a short space of time has been impressive.",
      "The Blues have had four players sent off since that abhorrent response to an early red card against Manchester United in September and collapse after a red card against Brighton the following week.",
      "That is a problem in itself, and many of those were late on with games already largely settled.",
      "But this was a substantial development. Chelsea lost their best player after 38 minutes against the best team in the league and perhaps world, yet were still the better side thereafter as a result of the coming-of-age of those who managed to stay on the pitch, and the decisions the manager made in response.",
      "",
      "Even Regis Le Bris can’t be sure “what we can achieve this season”. But there is one certainty with Sunderland: “This team has a strong character and they want to fight.”",
      "That much was evident against Bournemouth, which in itself was a neat microcosm of their season. Sunderland have salvaged more points from losing positions than any Premier League club in 2025/26, and here were three more rescued in historic fashion.",
      "Never before in 621 Premier League games had they come from two goals down to win. Yet even when Bournemouth capitalised so ruthlessly on a couple of individual errors in the first 15 minutes it never really felt as though Sunderland were out of it.",
      "As Le Bris said, they have mastered how to “change the dynamic”, to “reset” and to “find solutions”, either from the dugout or on the pitch through the guidance and experience of Granit Xhaka, Nordi Mukiele, Reinildo or any of the numerous other leaders emerging in this squad.",
      "It is a neat trick – remarkable for a promoted club under a manager new to the Premier League, really – to be able to compartmentalise situations and setbacks and respond so emphatically. Sunderland following all three of their defeats so far with a win in the next game (a feat only Arsenal can match and they’ve lost just once) is no happy accident.",
      "",
      "It sums up their early-season malaise that consecutive Premier League wins have lifted Fulham from 15th to 15th. But the complexion of their campaign has transformed: they are closer to a Champions League qualification place than the relegation zone in terms of points.",
      "Marco Silva has landed on a happy balance: the defence is settled; the Iwobi-Berge midfield axis is working; the competition for places in the attacking positions buzzing behind and around the centre-forward is healthy; and Raul Jimenez is still playing that line-leading role impeccably.",
      "When they start as rapidly as in north London and fortune favours that bravery, it is difficult to work out quite why they have struggled so fundamentally this season.",
      "Silva credited “the Nigerian boys” for fostering “a great atmosphere” within the squad, and singled out one soaring Super Eagle.",
      "Samu Chukwueze has been Fulham’s best and most decisive player in consecutive games. He leads the entire league for touches in the opposition penalty area per 90 of those who have played more than a handful of minutes, and Spurs could not handle him.",
      "That £21.9m loan option might just be explored; the outcome of Silva’s ongoing contract negotiations could depend on it.",

      "Recent evidence of that promotion has been scant. Foden did impress in the Champions League against Borussia Dortmund last month but his last proper scruff-of-the-neck performance might have been as far back as Brentford in January, or the final day of 2023/24.",
      "Foden started something Manchester City inexplicably couldn’t finish and ultimately needed him to. Pep Guardiola has been calling seemingly all season for someone to help Erling Haaland with those bags and finally his prayers were answered.",
      "The previous latest goal to put Manchester City in the lead in the Premier League this season was scored in the 61st minute against Burnley. Some stoppage-time heroics – and Foden being the one to conjure such majesty – was long overdue.",

      "Rough calculations suggest Nick Woltemade scoring from an Anthony Elanga pass is the second-most expensive goal combination of two summer signings this season behind Benjamin Sesko setting Bryan Mbeumo up against Brighton in October.",
      "Newcastle signing Woltemade and Elanga in part because both those players chose Manchester United instead adds another delicious layer of narrative.",
      "Another interesting Woltemade line: his six domestic goals so far have all been assisted by different players. Newcastle diversifying their supply line is no bad thing.",

      "Has Amorim got Man Utd on the Arsenal path to Premier League dominance? Probably not; can’t even instinctively tell you the name of their set-piece coach for a start.",
      "But they are definitely on the right track towards, well, something. Which is more than can be said for the last few years.",
      "The Everton defeat was an abomination, but it seems increasingly like the exception to a new rule the club is trying to implement. Even against Palace they were poor for large periods of the game and could have been further behind at half time.",
      "Yet that only reinforces how things are changing slowly under Amorim. Where once they would have been swept away by that sort of storm, this group is learning how to weather it and emerge for the better.",

      "For so long Leeds have needed a variation on a tired, failing blueprint, with the desire for a different approach painfully obvious. The minute Farke reverts to his beloved 4-3-3, the axe should swing.",
      "But this was finally proof that he can adjust and adapt, even if it was entirely forced by the prospect of a defeat so chastening that unemployment was the only feasible outcome at half time.",
      "When the barrel is staring down at you so forebodingly, it’s almost easier to chuck Dominic Calvert-Lewin on, stick two up top, call for more physicality and go for it with nothing to lose. The real test will be how he sets up from the start against Chelsea in midweek.",

Fulham have joined Bournemouth in recording their only Premier League away win this season at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium. It remains the only venue Wolves have scored in or taken a point from as visitors in 2025/26.",

Being beaten after leading 2-0 and investing time in anything other than introspection only ever comes across, as Iraola said, like the actions of a “bad loser”.",

      "David Moyes and Ruben Amorim actively praising the literal fight shown by the midfielder at Old Trafford always seemed at least slightly disingenuous. Everton holding out for that win reflected well only on the players who managed not to slap a teammate, and abysmally on the hosts who failed to take advantage.",
      "Everton were considerably worse with 11 men against Newcastle than 10 on Monday. Gueye’s absence sapped their energy and solidity and without that flashpoint to bring them together, it was as disjointed a performance as the Hill Dickinson has seen.",
      "With the Senegalese out for two more games and then away on international duty at AFCON soon after, this was a humbling insight into how that period could look for Everton.",

After marking thin air for the first goal – with others far more culpable – his brace of weak header back to the keeper and curious choice of backheeling the ball into the path of Stefanos Tzimas will have had the City Ground sports science department quadrupling their order of cotton wool to wrap Murillo in.",

      "Three teams have been picked for more Premier League TV games than Arsenal, Liverpool and Chelsea this season. Manchester United, obviously, but also…",
      "Premier League clubs received a total of £2.83billion last season, which was comprised of six payments through the division’s ‘central revenue system’, something the Premier League says ‘ensures the most equitable distribution of funds of any major European league’.",
      "Liverpool were paid £174.9m as champions – short of Manchester City’s record £176.2m in 2022/23 – while Newcastle received just over £160m to chuck into their PSR black hole.",
      "Southampton were handed £109.2m for their efforts in finishing a distant bottom. It pays to be in the Premier League.",
      "Some of those payments are fixed. All 20 clubs automatically receive around £96.9m through an equal share distributed based on both the domestic (£29.8m in 2024/25) and international (£59.2m in 2024/25) broadcast deals – those TV rights are lucrative for a reason – as well as £7.9m each from central commercial revenue streams.",
      "The rest is variable, based on where clubs finish and how often their games are selected for broadcast.",
      "",
      "The Premier League merit payments are distributed on a sliding scale from 1st to 20th, made up of combined earnings from domestic and international broadcast deals.",
      "For the 2024/25 season, the difference in prize money was around £2.7m per position. Southampton were given as much for finishing bottom, all the way up to champions Liverpool receiving £53.1m. It basically helped pay for 97.4% of Giorgi Mamardashvili and Jeremie Frimpong.",
      "That can be expected to fluctuate with inflation and other factors – it was around £2.8m per position in 2023/24 – but it offers a rough guide as to what clubs should expect to earn this season.",
      "",
      "1st (Arsenal) – £53.1m",
      "2nd (Manchester City) – £50.4m",
      "3rd (Chelsea) – £47.7m",
      "4th (Aston Villa) – £45m",

      "20th (Wolves) – £2.7m",
      "",
      "The only other part of the prize money which is not fixed and shared equally are the facility fees, which are based on how many times each club has been selected for television.",
      "In 2024/25, Liverpool had 30 games televised in the UK, for which they received £24.9m in facility fees. Arsenal had 29 matches and were paid £24.2m, while Manchester United (28 games for £23.4m), Aston Villa (27 games for £22.6m) and Chelsea (26 games for £21.8m) were televised frequently and rewarded handsomely.",
      "Ipswich were shown on the fewest occasions and received £8.9m in facility fees for their 10 live televised UK fixtures.",
      "This can lead to discrepancies in terms of those variable payments. Manchester United’s prize money after finishing 15th last season was £136.2m, more than the four clubs immediately above them – West Ham (£130.9m in 14th), Everton (£131.8m in 13th), Crystal Palace (£136.1m in 12th) and Fulham (£135.5m in 11th) – as Ruben Amorim’s side were picked for far more live TV games.",
      "Spurs were another massive outlier, earning more in 17th (£127.8m) than Wolves did in 16th (£123.1m) in part because they had nine more games picked for live UK broadcast.",

      "",
      "One big change in Premier League prize money going forward is that the 2025/26 season represents the start of a new four-year TV deal cycle.",
      "A new record £6.7bn domestic rights deal will see the number of live games rocket up to 267 of a possible 380, with every Premier League game outside the protected Saturday 3pm kick-offs to be broadcast live.",

      "Overseas TV rights are worth more than £2bn per year to the Premier League with new deals signed with broadcasters in Japan and Mexico to go alongside lucrative packages in America, Scandinavia, Thailand, China, India and elsewhere.",
      "But the facility fee payments are tied to how many times a team is picked for broadcast by Sky and TNT, with both broadcasters having made their picks up to before Boxing Day. One game generally translates to roughly £0.83m but does fluctuate.",
      "Aston Villa, Manchester United and Newcastle were the biggest winners from the latest round of picks up to February 2 with three more games each.",
      "Arsenal were among seven teams to only have one more match chosen.",
      "=1st) Aston Villa and Manchester United (21 games televised live in the UK) – worth around £18.5m in 2024/25",

      "Manchester United have no chance of signing Elliot Anderson for a cut-price fee, while Manchester City’s hijack is another blow for Ruben Amorim…",
      "Anderson is on a list of ten non-Big Six stars primed for a transfer in 2026, but he is far more likely to leave Forest in the summer than in January.",
      "The former Newcastle United star has had an extraordinary rise since departing his boyhood club, establishing himself as one of the finest defensive midfielders in Europe and a near-certain starter for England at next summer’s World Cup.",
      "Anderson‘s sudden rise is a huge boost for England as he provides a fix in a problem position, and Man Utd appear to hope that he can have the same effect on Amorim’s team.",
      "It is clear for all to see that the Red Devils are crying out for a top-tier No.6 to be Casemiro’s long-term replacement, and Anderson is widely reported to be a preferred target with Brighton’s Carlos Baleba and/or Crystal Palace’s Adam Wharton.",
      "READ: Has Amorim got Man Utd on the Arsenal path to Premier League dominance?",
      "Man Utd’s willingness to test Brighton’s resolve over £100m-rated Baleba in the summer proves they are aware that they need to sign a new defensive midfielder soon, with Anderson standing out as a perfect fit.",
      "Unfortunately for Man Utd, a January deal involving Anderson has never been likely. This is presumably why they are also reportedly looking at Wolves’ Joao Gomes as a potential low-cost target until they can sign a midfielder of a higher level and price bracket in the summer.",
      "With Anderson, Forest are bound to put financial obstacles in the way of a winter exit as they will know it would be foolish to sell their best player while they are far from safe from relegation and are hoping to progress deep into the Europa League.",
      "Anderson, too, should be against a January move because he would be in a far stronger negotiating position and would have more options once he’s presumably shone as a key player for England at a World Cup.",
      "So it was confusing when it was reported last month that the Red Devils are ‘confident’ of signing Anderson in January for a cut-price fee worth around £70m.",
      "Unsurprisingly, this nonsense report has now been exposed by an update from journalist Sacha Tavolieri, while Man City’s interest is another blow for Man Utd.",
      "Tavolieri claims Man City are ‘in love with Anderson’, while he is ‘giving priority’ to Pep Guardiola’s side over other teams. Also, the ‘only snag’ for this deal is something anyone with their head screwed on was already aware of.",
      "‘The only snag is that Evangelos Marinakis’ demands are far higher than City’s valuations so far, and they have refused to offer Nottingham Forest the £100 million.",
      "‘Whatever happens, Anderson will remain in London in January. His departure is only conceivable after the 2026 World Cup.’",
      "Man Utd (and others) put Newcastle United in their box in the summer window, though Arsenal, Chelsea, Vikor Gyokeres and Liam Delap proved where the Red Devils are in the pecking order, so Anderson’s reported transfer stance is justified.",
      "And while it is conceivable that United outbid City to gain favour for Anderson, it would still take a large portion of next year’s budget to sign him, and they have no hope of landing when a new midfielder is ideally required in January.",
      "Nottingham Forest are hoping to get around £100m for Elliot Anderson after Man City put him at the top of their midfield shortlist, according to reports.",
      "Man Utd will not be signing Nottingham Forest midfielder Elliot Anderson in the January transfer window, according to reports.",
      "Man Utd are now ‘confident’ that they can seal a cut-price deal for Nottingham Forest midfielder Elliot Anderson, according to reports.",
      "Man Utd legend Paul Scholes thinks Nottingham Forest midfielder Elliot Anderson would be a “really good signing” for Ruben Amorim’s side.",
      "According to reports, Manchester United have already ‘decided’ who is at the ‘top of the list’ as they look to sign a new midfielder in 2026.",
      "Arsenal have reportedly entered the race to sign Nottingham Forest midfielder Elliot Anderson with the Gunners ‘not backing down’ over his price tag."

      "The Dutch forward has not had an easy time of things since moving to Old Trafford in a £36.5m (€42.5m, $49.5m) deal from Bolonga in summer 2024. While he scored on his debut, a 1-0 win over Fulham at the start of the 2024/25 campaign, Zirkzee has netted only eight times in his 56 appearances for United, while just three assists show he’s not really good enough to play as a No.10 either.",
      "However, the 24-year-old spent the recent international break preparing for his big opportunity in the team as Manchester United reacted to Benjamin Sesko’s injury.",
      "Amorim has always admired Zirkzee on a technical level, but has been unsure how to fit him into the team’s plan.",
      "However, after spending a lot of time coaching the player and working on his game in a programme designed to not just work out his role for the club but how they could unlock his full potential within the current set-up, United and Amorim are now starting to see their efforts bear fruit.",
      "And while Zirkzee has been linked with a move away – and Roma are confirmed admirers of the player and are very much open to a January deal if an arrangement could be agreed – this spell was always viewed as a pivotal period in determining his future.",
      "If it had gone badly, then United were willing to open up to a departure. However, he scored a good goal in the 2-1 win against Crystal Palace on Sunday, and sources are now suggesting that Amorim is now very much keen to keep him for the rest of the season.",

      "An exit has never been pushed by the boss because he is concerned about the lack of depth and likes the fact that Zirkzee understands his game plans.",
      "And with Zirkzee on the scoresheet and helping United overturn a 1-0 half-time deficit to win 2-1 at Selhurst Park, Amorim was quick to praise the Netherlands international.",
      "“It is more important than just the goals. Again, the small details, win the first ball, so we can win the second ball, the connection, that is so important for our game. And the goal is really important for us and for him.”",
      "The game also saw Kobbie Mainoo enter the action as a 90th-minute substitute, meaning he has still only played 170 minutes of action in the Premier League this season – and all eight of his appearances have come off the bench, with none as a starter.",
      "Also strongly linked with a January departure, the midfielder still faces a fight to get a move to another team in January, with Amorim only willing to sanction his exit if a replacement is signed first.",
      "Zirkzee, meanwhile, had played just 82 minutes combined across this Premier League season leading into the last international break, but has played the full 90 minutes of their last two games.",
      "As a result, Amorim is aware that it only takes one injury for the situation to change; hence the manager’s unwillingness to let the 20-year-old midfielder leave without a fight.",

      "On the subject of potential new midfielders, United have been given a golden opportunity to sign Atletico Madrid star Conor Gallagher, as speculation ramps up over a potential January switch to Old Trafford.",
      "As reported by TEAMtalk transfer insider Fraser Fletcher, Crystal Palace’s Adam Wharton, Brighton’s Carlos Baleba, and Nottingham Forest’s Elliot Anderson top the shortlist.",
      "But the trio will all command fees north of £70m, perhaps even as high as £100m, so their potential signings will likely have to wait until next summer.",
      "Wharton, meanwhile, showcased exactly why United should move for him with an outstanding first-half display in Palace’s 2-1 defeat to the Red Devils, and with sources able to shed light on the likelihood of a switch to Old Trafford.",
      "In other news, a shock report claims United have presented a ‘contract offer’ to Antoine Semenyo, after holding a meeting with his representatives on Wednesday last week.",
      "Liverpool are still considered frontrunners to sign the Bournemouth winger, but Amorim is a big admirer of his."

      "That put Nuno Espirito Santo and West Ham in clear and present danger of both seeking their third appointment of the season already, but he’s pulled off a couple of wins to ease those fears. Even Nottingham Forest have been a different beast under Sean Dyche.",

      "An earlier version of this oft-updated piece speculated on what might happen to Mikel Arteta should Arsenal suffer from their Nightmare Start. What if they lost a few early games? What then? We concluded this:",
      "It’s far likelier that Arsenal emerge blinking into the autumn sunshine broadly unscathed from their nightmare horrors. No denying that this season does represent one in which Arteta might completely lose the plot and go entirely off the rails. Or the one where he wins the league by 10 points. Feels like we’re odds-on to get one or the other.",
      "Arsenal emerged duly unscathed, and have already cashed in on the shift to easier fixtures of their own alongside much tougher ones for Liverpool to take top spot in the Premier League.",
      "Only question that remains, therefore, is what Arsenal do from here. We are absolutely certain that it either involves p*ssing the league by 10 points or a complete and total meltdown. Nothing in between is acceptable or even conceivable. And it really is looking more and more like it’s the first one.",
      "READ: Who will be the next manager of Arsenal if Mikel Arteta is sacked?",
      "",
      "One of the key early-season imponderables for 25/26 was just how big and what kind of impact the Club World Cup might have on the way Chelsea and Man City start the season. Would they hit the ground running, or would they be a bit tired and out of sorts? For both, it’s been a little from column A, a little from column B.",
      "Maresca definitely still has some hearts and minds to win at Chelsea despite the fine finish to the season that saw them tick off Champions League qualification while completing their collection of UEFA pots and pans and then winning the actual Club World Cup.",
      "A home draw with Crystal Palace wasn’t ideal, but the paddling dished out to West Ham has what really should at least be some kind of halfway credible title bid up and running at least. And we strongly suspect Fulham won’t be the last team left scratching their head after losing to Maresca.",
      "There was some talk of ‘Maresca out’ after a draw with Brentford but that was surely only a minority view. After losing to Manchester United in shambolic fashion, there were more on the bandwagon.",
      "That win over Liverpool was big, though, and a particularly good one for Maresca himself. The second half thumping of Forest was handy, too, albeit inevitably saying far more of their opponents than it did of Chelsea. Home defeat to Sunderland saw awkward questions resurfacing, but three wins from three before going toe-to-toe against champions elect Arsenal despite playing most of the game down to 10 men appears to have rubber-stamped Chelsea’s bona fides.",

      "Six wins in the bag already and comfortably more points than Southampton managed in the entirety of 24/25. Widespread expectation that tougher games would bring Sunderland back down with a bump have thus far proved wide of the mark; there won’t be many teams unhappy at taking four points from two games against Chelsea and Arsenal this season. The comeback victory over Bournemouth was evidence, if indeed it was still required, that Sunderland are proper.",

      "Nailed it in the Community Shield, but as ever for clubs on Palace’s level there’s a positive-and-negative scale to be balanced by your manager catching the eye so conspicuously. Glasner absolutely could be poached with bigger beasts surely paying attention to the work he’s done at Selhurst Park.",
      "And if that poaching comes from outside the Premier League, then it comes with the possibility of making Glasner the next Premier League managerial casualty. But still very unlikely.",
      "We’d imagine the significant lowering of the threat level for a Ruben Amorim Sack at United eased some nerves at Selhurst Park, but the significant raising of the threat level for a Thomas Frank Sack at Spurs has them looking a bit nervous once more.",

      "The continuity candidate in the summer, and looked to have received the ultimate hospital pass. How much continuity could there be at Brentford given they’d sold Bryan Mbeumo, Yoane Wissa and Christian Norgaard, while Thomas Frank took most of the remaining coaching staff with him to Tottenham? It was a very Brentford move to promote from within and we’ll hold our hands up and admit we thought it would go far, far worse than it has.",

Then jumped right up to third favourite when Villa’s rankling disappointment at how last season ended leaked into a six-match winless start to this campaign.",
      "But then along came four Premier League wins in a row to thoroughly lift the mood at a club where a few short weeks earlier it really did feel like they’d come to the end of something special without ever getting the definitive moment of success it deserved.",
      "That run is now seven wins in eight Premier League games and has lifted Villa right through the mid-table slop and up into the top four. Four wins in five games have a distinctly winnable Europa League campaign bubbling along nicely, too. An astonishing shift from what felt like an inexorable downward spiral not that long ago.",
      "We could all learn something from that, but we won’t.",
      "",
      "A sacking remains out of the question despite last season’s (relative) struggles. There hasn’t been a Premier League manager since Fergie in his pomp with more credit in the bank than Pep.",
      "But is there still a distinct chance Guardiola decides he’s had enough and simply walks away? We reckon there is, and it’s always worth remembering that we’re talking Next Premier League Manager To Leave here, and that the traditional ‘Sack Race’ shorthand is a bit misleading.",
      "Still, though. Almost no chance at this point that any of that could happen swiftly enough for nobody else to have been canned first. Even if that defeat at Newcastle and near disaster against lowly Leeds do highlight the very real risk of a second consecutive season without a meaningful title challenge.",
      "",
      "Fine end to 24/25 put a different complexion on Brighton’s season than at one time appeared likely. Ending up a clear best of the rest outside the quickly established top seven represented at least a passing grade and they’d have to make a truly awful start to the season to get in any kind of managerial-change bother.",
      "The win over Newcastle to go with victory at Chelsea to go with a win over City reaffirms Brighton’s big-boy-bothering calibre, but does also make some of their other results – draws with Fulham and Wolves, for instance – a bit annoying.",
      "Still, though. Top five after 13 games is fine work whichever way you slice it.",
      "",
      "Has done more than could ever have been expected given the chaos he walked into. That epic pants-pulling at Anfield surely leaves Dyche as safe as any manager ever can be in Mr Marinakis’ lair. Were oddly rubbish against Brighton, though.",

      "Still among the least sackable managers in the top flight despite Bournemouth now being in the depths of one of the familiar lows that have always existed alongside the highs under Iraola.",
      "A streaky manager of a streaky team, but he must still be in credit overall given the prognostications of doom when he had to sell pretty much his entire defence in the summer. It’s hurting him and Bournemouth now – only the bottom four have conceded more goals – but mid-table comfiness remains an impressive effort on the back of such a challenging summer.",
      "",
      "Seven points from three games against Newcastle, Burnley and Bournemouth left things looking far comfier than might have been expected for a manager who, when the Magpies took an early lead at the London Stadium, looked to be heading for a second sack of the season long before the Christmas decorations went up.",
      "But quite why Nuno had to be so very Nuno in the way he, on the back of 3-1 and 3-2 wins and a 2-2 draw, decided to approach a home game against a Liverpool team that had just suffered three consecutive three-goal defeats, is puzzling, irritating and, above all, a reminder that he is here as a firefighter and that the marriage to a fanbase with limited patience for drab and functional let’s-not-get-relegated football is merely one of convenience.",
      "",
      "A 4-1 thumping of Everton followed a simply huge and wildly unexpected win over Manchester City. Had Newcastle lost that, as all pre-interlull indications suggested they would, then the spotlight would have been harsh indeed on Howe and his team. They would at that point find themselves slap bang in the muck of a relegation scrap; instead they have lifted themselves back into the mid-table morass where – luckily for them – absolutely nobody is any good at all and the chance of re-establishing themselves in there and even emerging out the top is very real indeed.",
      "There are multiple reasons for Newcastle making such a sticky start to the season and very few of them are directly the fault of a man who did deliver the club’s first trophy in bloody ages last season. That one seismic result against City had vast implications for the title race – in that it confirms there almost certainly won’t now actually be one – but was so big for Newcastle and their manager themselves.",
      "",
      "Sounds preposterous, but there really is a non-zero chance Moyes gets punished for easing Everton’s immediate relegation fears and they seek some more enterprising football from a squad that is, in fairness, capable of that. Does feel like a very familiar Everton story, though, and one that ends with them 16th, chastened, and bringing in another firefighter.",
      "We are treating the Brendan Rodgers links with mountains of salt.",
      "",
      "Time to stop trying to work out if Man United are good or rubbish. They’re just meh. Arguably that’s even worse, really, when This Is Manchester United Football Club We’re Talking About. But trying to look for clues in the tea-leaves of their results is completely futile when they do things like win three games in a row and then come unstuck at Nottingham Forest or fail even to win at Tottenham like literally everyone else is able to do at the moment.",
      "Losing at home to 10-man Everton and then winning from a goal down at Crystal Palace just highlights the pointlessness of trying to read anything into what Manchester United are doing. It’s just a bunch of stuff that happens.",
      "What does that mean for Ruben Amorim? That he’s probably fine. They’re slightly less bad than they were, and he wasn’t sacked then. So probably won’t be now.",
      "",
      "So doomed now they might as well stick with Edwards for a bit. He’s only just got here.",
      "",
      "Backed in to a hot favourite as the whispers began before the international break. But just when we thought it might be time to accept something is fundamentally broken here as a relegation fight bubbled up, an impressive win over Sunderland and a restorative visit to Dr Tottenham have sorted things right out.",
      "That’s good news, because we remain firmly wedded to the idea that both Fulham and Silva would be worse off without the other.",
      "",
      "Burnley really did have a horrible fixture list in these opening weeks under a manager with a horrible record at this level, and were given an opening-day reminder by the team that finished 17th last season of just how much harder the ‘simply don’t concede any goals at all’ tactic might be to deploy in the Premier League.",
      "Essentially, Burnley have got back to this level the same way Homer Simpson got to a heavyweight title fight. And Spurs and City have already given them a pummelling.",
      "Victories over Sunderland and Leeds were an impressive and necessary reminder that it might still be enough against teams more on their level, and while a 3-2 win at Wolves was not exactly The Burnley Way it’s still three points against an established – if struggling – Premier League side.",
      "But for all the talk of an encouraging fight from the promoted teams this time around, two of the three now find themselves in the bottom three after runs of four straight defeats. And that quickly builds pressure.",
      "",
      "Impossible to avoid the conclusion that Slot’s reaction to Liverpool’s mini-crisis becoming actual-crisis was poor. He went Full Klopp with his salty loser behaviour when Manchester United committed the crime of altering their tactics to give themselves the best chance of success against Liverpool, and the headloss continued after another chaotic and unstructured performance led to a 3-2 defeat at Brentford.",
      "Having ticked ‘opposition doing tactics wrong’ off his rattled manager bingo card, he can now add ‘losing his mind over entirely uncontroversial refereeing decisions’ with his response to both the Cody Gakpo non-penalty and Virgil van Dijk penalty at the Gtech.",
      "It has to be a worry for Liverpool that Slot has for the first time in his Anfield career found himself under any kind of pressure after a chastening run of defeats, and has suffered severe and instant headloss as a result.",
      "Funny to think of a manager who’s just beaten Real Madrid in the Champions League being under threat, but defeat at the Etihad was miserable before Nottingham Forest came along and achieved the amusing feat of being the first team to shut Liverpool out in the Premier League at Anfield since Nottingham Forest.",
      "And then there was a new nadir against PSV. That really was very, very bad. West Ham were wonderfully welcoming hosts on Sunday, but to such an inexplicable extent that it’s hard to know just how much to read into Liverpool’s 2-0 win at the London Stadium against opponents who were barely there.",
      "",
      "There have been good days and bad, and our whole pondering of Frank’s situation at Spurs has been about determining which of the two would eventually win out. And after a brutal, disastrous week, it’s really now starting to look like it’s the bad days.",
      "Spurs were timid and abysmal in the North London Derby, the second big London derby in a row which Frank had approached more in the manner of a League One manager attempting to avoid a paddling in the FA Cup third round than a legitimate rival facing a familiar foe.",
      "There was some encouragement in a 5-3 Champions League defeat at PSG, but even the very fact it’s possible to write the words ‘some encouragement in a 5-3 Champions League defeat’ is in its own way damning.",
      "But at least those two defeats came against what genuinely might be the two best teams in Europe at this time. With all due respect to Fulham and the sterling work of Marco Silva in recent years, they are not one of the two best teams in Europe at this time, and they were still much better than Spurs who torpedoed themselves inside the opening seven minutes to extend their extraordinarily – and in fairness largely pre-Frank – awful home record in the Premier League to three wins in 21 games since an increasingly odd-looking 4-1 win over Aston Villa in November last year.",
      "Frank’s response to the booing of Guglielmo Vicario after his hideous blunder was firmly in the ‘That’s true, but he shouldn’t say it’ category. And the way he went about it was all wrong.",
      "There should have been some acknowledgement that the booing of Vicario, unsavoury and unhelpful as it may have been, did not burst forth from a clear blue sky but instead a bubbling frustration from fans who pay among the highest ticket prices in the country to watch what is now among the worst and least effective football in the country.",
      "To instead label those supporters – and the boos did not come from a tiny minority inside the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium – not real Spurs fans was another gaffe that pushes the manager further towards the exit.",
      "Until now we’d felt the obvious comparisons between Thomas Frank and Nuno Espirito Santo didn’t quite fit.",
      "But it’s certainly starting to look uncomfortably similar in familiar ways; the small-time approach to big games has not been well received and the fear grows that he just doesn’t understand what this job requires. The fact almost no manager in Premier League history has managed to understand what this job requires is cold comfort at this time.",
      "Spurs go to Newcastle – where their recent record is utterly horrific – this week before welcoming Frank’s old club Brentford at the weekend. Entirely conceivable now that the Bees could put their former manager out of a job in that one.",
      "READ: Ten reasons why it’s going wrong for Thomas Frank’s Spurs – and it’s going to get worse",
      "",
      "Surely doomed now, and the hard-nosed yet valid argument persists that Leeds could and perhaps should have taken drastic action in the summer. It would have made Spurs’ decision to sack Europa League-winning Ange Postecoglou look positively kind, Leeds – and Burnley for that matter – might now be better off had they thanked the managers who secured 100 Championship points and got them back into the big time and then sent them on their way.",
      "Farke had a dreadful Premier League record of only six wins and 26 points from his 49 games in charge of Norwich, a team he twice led to promotion from the Championship with 94 and 97 points.",
      "As well as fighting his own record in this competition, Farke faced the added burden of expectation levels very different to those at just about any other club that could possibly find itself promoted into the Premier League in this current era where that represents the most bittersweet of successes.",
      "Defeat at Burnley was honking, but bouncing back to win another six-pointer against West Ham eased the stress significantly before a paddling at Brighton and events elsewhere – including West Ham themselves – left Farke desperately short of immediate cover before a desperately poor show in a six-pointer at Nottingham Forest.",
      "Another painful defeat having gone in front, against Villa this time, saw Leeds drop into the bottom three ahead of a brutal run of games, and he’s now passed the point where ‘credit in defeat to Manchester City’ does anything more than delay the inevitable ahead of Chelsea, before some hope of respite against mid-table Liverpool.",
      "Manchester United beating Palace ‘had some SERIOUS caveats attached. And Thomas Frank and Arne Slot show why there will not be another Carlo Ancelotti.",

      "Arne Slot, Ruben Amorim, Thomas Frank…they will all be thrown from the top-floor window of the Premier League’s gaudy, gold skyscraper of excess.",

      "A game which allowed for a like-for-like comparison between managers and players in the same system saw Ruben Amorim and Manchester United overwhelmingly pale in that comparison to their Crystal Palace counterparts in the first half, before they took full advantage of their hosts’ malaise after the break to claim victory.",
      "As Jean-Philippe Mateta bulldozed his way through the United defence the ball was frequently seen bouncing off Joshua Zirkzee on at the other end, as Maxence Lacroix treated the maligned Red Devil’s attacking presence with the disdain it deserved with a dominating display completely at odds with that of Matthijs de Ligt, who shrunk in the presence of the Palace striker.",
      "Luke Shaw continued to ‘amble’ and so too did Marc Guehi, but the latter in a peak Virgil van dijk ‘I’m better than you’ sort of way rather than the former’s tribute to the current ‘his legs have gone’ iteration of the Liverpool captain.",
      "The most damning contrast came in midfield, where Casemiro and Bruno Fernandes routinely played passes to where teammates could and perhaps should have been but weren’t, often into spaces actually occupied by Crystal Palace players, as Adam Wharton and Daichi Kamada showed them how that midfield pivot can function effectively.",
      "Wharton is inarguably the star man in the pairing. His excellent round-the-corner pass for Mateta before Leny Yoro tumbled into the striker to concede the penalty was one of many examples in the first half of his forward-first desire and ability.",
      "As both Casemiro and Fernandes dawdled on the ball, Wharton – and to a lesser but still notable extent Kamada – didn’t hand their opposite numbers the opportunity to catch them in possession as they did to them. It works because, unlike the United duo, they can both do everything, albeit with varying levels of quality.",
      "Mateta could easily have scored a couple more and Palace really should have been at least two up at the break as Eddie Nketiah ran in sand to deny himself a clear opportunity to score in stoppage-time. A United comeback looked incredibly unlikely.",
      "They were better in the second half and showed plenty of the “fight” Amorim was desperate for after the defeat to Everton. Crucially, they were playing for the manager.",
      "But it did feel as though their superiority was more down to Palace’s dwindling reserves of energy than their own uptick in intensity.",
      "Oliver Glasner’s side hadn’t won any of their previous three Premier League clashes after Thursday night Conference League commitments, losing to Everton and Arsenal, and drawing with Brighton. And they looked as though they had quite simply run out of gas after their 2-1 away defeat to Strasbourg.",
      "Eight of the starting XI for the midweek game started here and while Wharton only played an hour in France, his downturn in the second half was as notable as anyone’s, and he was hooked with 15 minutes to go here as Palace searched for an equaliser after Casemiro and Fernandes wrestled control in the second half.",

But it was a glorious finish from Fernandes’ free-kick as he controlled on his chest and smashed the ball across Dean Henderson from a tight angle.",

But he made the difference in a moment, as Mason Mount did with a drilled shot after a short Fernandes pass from another free-kick to draw United level with Arsenal at the top of the charts with ten goals from set pieces this term.",
      "And in what Arsenal have shown to be a tried-and-tested method of picking up Premier League wins for much of this season, United followed up their set-piece goals with some solid defending.",
      "Has Amorim therefore in fact got United on the same path imperiously trodden by Mikel Arteta’s side on their way to Premier League dominance? They played similarly safe, often boring football before a recent surge in quality and impact from open play.",

      "Manchester United are widely expected to target new wing-backs in the transfer market as Ruben Amorim has struggled to find a workable solution for either flank this season, and after giving a brutal assessment of Patrick Dorgu on the back of the Dane’s ill-advised use of social media this week, the Red Devils manager’s team selection for the clash with Crystal Palace suggests the 21-year-old could soon be out in the cold.",
      "Dorgu was Amorim’s first signing as Manchester United boss when he joined in a £25m move from Lecce in January. He struggled along with the rest of his teammates in his debut half-season and there are no real signs of improvement in the left wing-back this term, with recent performances leading him to be picked out as a weak link in the United side.",
      "In a withering assessment of his contributions ahead of the Palace game, Amorim said: “You can feel the anxiety every time Patrick touches the ball. I can feel the anxiety. When I see Patrick playing for the national team, he scored a great goal against Scotland and the decision that he made under pressure was completely different than the decision he’s making in our team. I think it’s the decision, he needs to be calmer playing the game.",
      "“I remember the shot against Everton. That was easier than the decision he had to make when a guy from Scotland was there. I saw it when he played in Italy. But again, here is different and sometimes the pressure is hard for them in the beginning. He has time to improve. I just need to understand the context in trying to help them (Dorgu and Dalot). They are far from their best, and they know it. Like a lot of players in our team, like myself. I just look at them, and think they have so much more to give. So let’s see this week if we can improve that.”",
      "Dalot, who’s also been far from his (mediocre) best takes Dorgu’s place on the left, with Amad Diallo dropping deeper in place of Noussair Mazraoui at right wing-back and Mason Mount coming into the starting lineup to occupy one of the inverted No.10 spots.",

      "Third, how the hell can the board sack a man who won the league last season? I don’t care about Klopp’s team blah blah blah – He took that team to the top of the league and on an excellent run in the Champions league – not to mention Carabao cup Finalists.",
      "Furthermore to my last point, if the board do part ways with him they must be firmly aware that if the incorrect choice in replacement is made and it fails; which I suspect it would, the fans would turn fully against them. The trues red supporters are far from stupid and blind",

      "",
      "This week we saw an impressive team display by a team from Merseyside where they showed a clear collective desire to fight for the good of the team, working tirelessly in that regard whilst having a clear incisive plan about how to attack the opposition – it’s just a shame to me that the team in question wore blue ( .. a genuine congratulations to the toffees for a performance that they can be rightly proud of against Man Utd).",
      "Which leads me to the crux of this mail – where is the collective fight to overcome adversity within this Liverpool team that we are watching this season?",
      "I have always felt across my many decades of supporting Liverpool that the collective spirit/battling qualities are part of our DNA and therefore a given. Recent viewings appear to be bringing this into question.",
      "That is not to say that if we solve that particular aspect that everything else will just fall into place – it feels to me that there are many layers to our current malaise (layers may be the wrong term here … perhaps a tangled ball of wool is more apt).",
      "Let me briefly comment on one or two (but not all !) of those key aspects as I see it:",
      "From a squad balance perspective there appears to have been a questionable prioritisation of transfer funds across the summer that has led to a situation where we are too thin in defensive areas. I can’t complain about the purchase of Wirtz as he looks to be an incredibly gifted footballer, but one who is struggling to adapt to the pace and physicality of the premier league as things stand (still feel he’ll likely come good though). What would also help is him having a clearer role in the team in terms of where he plays – I am not saying we have to build the team around him, but it does feel like the opposite has happened with Slot’s decisions to shunt him around to different positions.",
      "You won’t get many Liverpool fans complaining about Ekitike, but the manner in which the Isak saga played out after his signing just feels that we got suckered into a ‘whose got the biggest d*ck’ contest with Newcastle and ended up spending top dollar for an ingredient that we may not have explicitly needed – as others have pointed out, there appears to have been no winners as things stand from that soap opera of a signing.",
      "So that’s £125m that could perhaps have been repointed to other key areas, namely defensive spine, and I include the No6 position in that.",
      "We have a scenario at the moment where our CB’s are not performing individually / collectively to the standards previously set, yet there appears to be no consequence to them for that – they effectively know that they are going to be starting the next game. Quite what Gomez has to do to get a start in the prem is beyond me – Slot says he is not match fit / sharp, yet fails to enlighten us as to how he can solve that whilst giving him no game time.",
      "I very much hope that Marc Guehi ends up being a Liverpool player, the sooner the better.",
      "Liverpool’s midfield have been off it this year – lacking aggression and togetherness – and providing a weakened shield to a more troubled defence (= goals against).",
      "I have said it in previous mails that I would like Liverpool to get a decent No6 to improve our options and add a bit of needed steel (Ederson from Atalanta would be an ideal).",
      "… but the summer money was spent elsewhere.",
      "Lastly, thoughts about how the team is being led currently.",
      "I’ve previously said that Slot has tried to integrate too many different new ingredients into the team stew whilst expecting the overall outcome to taste the same – previous experience both inside and outside the club should have told him that was perhaps a little naïve.",
      "He appears to be quite stubborn in some of his continued selections of certain new players who appear to be struggling form wise (eg. Kerkez), when I feel an alternative blanket approach should have been adopted, namely that each new player should have come to the club on the broad understanding that they had to earn their place in the team. Robertson should have played ahead of Kerkez until form dictated otherwise. Bradley (when fit !) should start at RB.",
      "The one new player who answered that form call in spades is Ekitike, and he finds himself marginalised in favour of a more expensive and currently less effective alternative (sigh).",

      "I want to reply to this comment from Micky P, ‘I don’t think the Jota situation has ever been seen anywhere in elite sport – a player in his prime dying suddenly.’ I would refer him to the 2020 season when Kobe Bryant died. While not all of the players and staff at the Lakers had played with Kobe and he wasn’t in his prime I’m sure the shadow of his loss stretched over the season. How did they respond? They won the championship. IF Liverpool were flying right now I am sure that would be the narrative. The ‘this means more’ drum would be beaten, the team would be speaking about it in the press. Instead it appears poor squad building as much as anything has disrupted their season. I’m not discounting the impact of grief. I am sure it plays a part in the situation but to write of the season seems a bit much for the ‘mentality monsters’ of LFC.\nHanKolo, Vietnam",

      "Mikey P, Cardiff brings up good points about the impact of Diogo Jota’s death on the Liverpool team, and while he felt there weren’t any other case histories in elite sport where the untimely death of a beloved teammate has had a profound effect on performance of the team, I can share two from American major league baseball history.",
      "So the Pittsburgh Pirates were a dominate team in the early 70s. They won their NL division three years consecutively with records of 89-73 (1970), 97-65 (1971) and 96-59 (1972), and won the 1971 World Series (I know…it’s called what it’s called).",
      "Then on Dec 31, 1972, Roberto Clemente, a true talisman for the Pirates who had been at the club for 18 years, died in a plane crash while on mercy mission to deliver aid and food to Nicaragua after a massive earthquake. He chartered the airplane himself and packed it with emergency supplies. I’ll let the good people at Wikipedia fill you in:",
      "“Clemente visited Managua, the capital city of Nicaragua, in late 1972, while managing the Puerto Rico national baseball team at the 1972 Amateur World Series. When Managua was affected by a massive earthquake three weeks later, on December 23, 1972, Clemente immediately set to work arranging emergency relief flights. He soon learned, however, that the aid packages on the first three flights had been diverted by corrupt officials of the Somoza government, never reaching victims of the quake. He decided to accompany the fourth relief flight, hoping that his presence would ensure that the aid would be delivered to the survivors.",
      "The airplane which he chartered for the New Year’s Eve flight, a Douglas DC-7 cargo plane, had a history of mechanical problems and it also had an insufficient number of flight personnel (the flight was missing a flight engineer and a copilot), and it was also overloaded by 4,200 pounds (1,900 kg). It crashed into the Atlantic Ocean off the coast of Isla Verde, Puerto Rico immediately after takeoff on December 31, 1972, due to engine failure.",
      "It would be an understatement to say Clemente was baseball GOAT conversation material from an on-field performance perspective and a saint of a humanitarian.",
      "What happened to the Pirates? Well the club and his adopted city of Pittsburgh were devastated. Many of Clemente’s teammates traveled to Puerto Rico to be with his family and his buddy Manny Sanguillén even personally went to the crash site and literally dove in the water to participate in recovery efforts.",
      "And the aftermath: the Pirates tanked in 1973, going 80-82 and finishing 3rd in the NL East after winning the division 3 years in a row. In 1974 they returned to winning ways topping their division in 1974, 1975 and 1976, and capped off a productive decade by winning the World Series in 1979.",
      "There is another baseball player, the New York Yankee’s Thurmon Munson, who also died in an airplane crash in August of 1979 – won’t share the whole story – but the Yankees had won their AL division and consecutive World Series in 1977 & 1978, but finished 1979 in 4th place in their division, way out of contention.",
      "MLB baseball teams play 162 game seasons, so that’s a lot of datapoints to establish trends of causative and correlative relationships.",
      "It’s no revelation that personal grief impacts humans in profound ways, but the sudden loss of a beloved teammate and “brother in arms” has happened before in elite sport and while it’s difficult to calculate/quantify the effect from a human perspective, you can see it on the pitch/baseball diamond, and it’s real.",
      "There are fans in Pittsburgh and New York still alive and old enough to remember the trauma of losing Clemente and Munson…and they probably would assume YNWA is a rap band, but YNWA is felt in spirit by the many who love their sports teams and have been through a grieving process similar to yours.

I would slightly disagree with Ian Wright that it is solely racially motivated when black players are criticised. I think the UK press has, on the whole, an issue with people, black/white/ whatever, that they perceive as above their station, too big for their boots, especially where they think that station feels like it has not been fully earned (same papers will have no problem with the royals mind).

      "Odds of 5/2 with Sky Bet for an Everton win certainly catch the eye when you dig into Bournemouth's recent defensive slide.",
      "The Cherries are conceding goals at a rate that should concern Andoni Iraola, with 15 shipped in their last six games. The departures of Dean Huijsen and Illia Zabarnyi are now being felt, stripping Bournemouth of both mobility and composure in central areas. The situation is compounded further by Marcos Senesi's suspension here, leaving Iraola without his most reliable defender in terms of timing, duels and experience of the Premier League.",
      "Everton thrive on territory, pressure and set-piece moments, precisely the areas where Bournemouth have begun to wobble. Under David Moyes, they've won seven of 15 away days. That could become eight.",
      "Manchester City's away form has developed a whiff of vulnerability that makes the 4/6 with Sky Bet for an away win look very skinny. The bookmakers must be quietly confident of getting Pep Guardiola's team beat here.",
      "City's problems aren't headline-grabbing collapses, they're subtle, the sort of issues that only appear when you start peeking a bit deeper. Across their last 17 Premier League away games, City are averaging just 1.19 goals scored per game. That's mid-table output - far from the title-winning days where they'd be averaging nearly two goals per game on the road. It's not a metric of dominant, odds-on favourites.",
      "Marco Silva's men can be ragged on their travels but at Craven Cottage they play with much more cohesion. Only Arsenal have conceded fewer (2) than Silva's men (3) in home matches this season.",
      "Fulham draw no bet at 5/2 with Sky Bet is a big price.",
      "Tottenham arrive at St James' Park carrying all the hallmarks of a team running on fumes in the final third.",
      "Across the season they're averaging just 9.5 shots per game and 3.2 shots on target per game, their lowest Premier League output since Opta started collating the data. Spurs remain a team that struggle to generate anything resembling sustained pressure.",
      "The underlying numbers paint an even bleaker picture. Spurs have posted an expected goals tally under 1.0 in each of their last four Premier League matches, and in seven of their last eight. That isn't a blip, that's an identity crisis. Thomas Frank is already under serious pressure.",
      "Newcastle are a beast at home, too. The intensity, the physicality, the speed of their press. Opponents get smothered long before they reach the final third.",
      "With Tottenham's chance creation non-existent and Newcastle's defensive metrics at St James' Park consistently strong, the win to nil at 2/1 with Sky Bet becomes the natural landing spot for the value hunters.",
      "Arsenal keep rolling in an efficient and relentless manner.",
      "Mikel Arteta's men are now unbeaten in 17 matches in all competitions, their longest streak under the Spaniard, and they're doing it with a defensive base that is as sturdy as anything in Europe.",
      "In fact, Arsenal boast the most clean sheets (7) and joint-fewest defeats (1) across all competitions in Europe's major leagues - elite numbers that tell you precisely where their authority lies.",
      "And Brentford are exactly the sort of team Arsenal tend to keep at arm's length.",
      "Arsenal and under 3.5 goals has landed in nine of their last 15 Premier League outings. That's the pattern. Professional wins.",
      "No need for fireworks when discipline and dominance will do, and that bet is on offer at Evens with Sky Bet.",
      "Ezri Konsa has quietly become one of the Premier League's most adept players at winning fouls. The numbers make the case: Konsa has been fouled at least twice in six of his last 11 starts, and across the season he's averaging 1.6 fouls drawn per game.",
      "Konsa's role under Unai Emery is tailor-made for drawing pressure. He steps into midfield, he drives into space and he becomes the trigger point for opposition presses.",
      "Konsa is on offer at 5/4 with Sky Bet to draw two or more fouls - it's a price that hasn't fully caught up with the player's true foul-drawing ability.",
      "Crystal Palace are giving off uneasy vibes - even for a fixture of this winnable magnitude.",
      "On the pitch, they remain a team with so much going for them but the mood music in the background is beginning to change. Oliver Glasner isn't exactly hiding his frustration with the lack of ambition being shown above him, and when a manager starts sounding such soundbites, it rarely stays contained.",
      "You don't need a psychology degree to know how quickly that can seep into a dressing room. Players can sense uncertainty. And suddenly a team that should be bullying lesser opposition becomes tentative and starts to feel that extra workload in their legs the world has been talking about.",
      "A draw looks on the cards, with Burnley on the double chance at Evens with Sky Bet looking a bet with potential.",
      "Wolves and their increased threat from set pieces under Rob Edwards remains a betting angle to explore.",
      "Yerson Mosquera has the attributes to be a big threat from such situations - he's tall, athletic and aerially competitive - and those qualities have been spotted by Edwards, based on how prominent Mosquera was in Wolves' set-piece structure in the defeat at Villa.",
      "The defender had two shots there and was denied a goal by a save-of-the-season contender from Emiliano Martinez. If Edwards rinses and repeats those set-piece routines, then Mosquera is great value in the shots market where he's Evens with Sky Bet to have one or more shots.",
      "Football seasons aren't defined by the headline fixtures like beating Liverpool at home and grabbing a point with 10 men against Arsenal. Those moments can create momentum and belief but they don't win titles. What does define a challenger for top honours are the awkward and gritty away days where the favourites must prove their resilience rather than their brilliance. And Chelsea's visit to Elland Road falls into that category. Win here and a title push could be on.",
      "If Chelsea are genuine title contenders then these are the games they must navigate. It's easy to raise your levels for Liverpool and Arsenal, it's far harder to reproduce that clarity when you're getting hunted by a team whose primary motivation is to make your evening a miserable one. This could be a fiddly fixture for Chelsea. The draw looks the bet at 3/1 with Sky Bet.",
      "If you've been riding the Liverpool goals conceded train in recent weeks, Sunday's 2-0 stroll against a meek and mild West Ham shouldn't spook you off the scent.",
      "One clean sheet against a side seemingly allergic to progressive passes doesn't suddenly fix what has become a very clear trend in that Liverpool are conceding big chances - and plenty of them. Only West Ham, Burnley, Manchester United and Everton are conceding more than Liverpool (23).",
      "Across their last eight games, Liverpool have shipped 16 goals.",
      "The aura of defensive invincibility that Virgil van Dijk and Ibrahima Konate once radiated has dimmed.",
      "Sunderland tick the exact boxes Liverpool have struggled with in that they're energetic, press with enthusiasm and attack space quickly when it's there. They don't need to dominate the game to score. All this adds up to both teams to score and over 2.5 goals being a nice slice of value at 11/10 with Sky Bet.",
      "Jarrod Bowen to score at 3/1 with Sky Bet is a generous gift from the traders at Sky Bet. An early Christmas present perhaps.",
      "Bowen is the spark in this West Ham side. He leads the way for shot-creating actions, progressive carries, ball progression and shots on target - Bowen does it all. When West Ham manage to pose a threat, it often goes through him.",
      "Manchester United have kept just two clean sheets in their last 21 games and there remain big structural issues in defence, with no authority in key areas."

      "That goal, Mount's second of the season, came minutes after Joshua Zirkzee ended a year-long wait for a Premier League goal with a finish from what looked like an impossible angle.",
      "With a combined xG of 0.05, United completed a second-half turnaround in a game that, before the halftime whistle, offered very little hope for Ruben Amorim's side. The Portuguese boss was critical of their display in the early exchanges in his post-match, saying his side \"cannot play like that in the Premier League\".",

      "United were outclassed and outfought by Palace in the opening 45 minutes despite showing early promise when Dean Henderson denied Casemiro an early goal with a smart stop. Amorim watched on as his side generated just 0.01 expected goals without set-pieces.",
      "In a run of play that summed up United's sorry showing, Leny Yoro clumsily brought down Jean-Philippe Mateta in the area to give away a sure penalty.",
      "Having initially sent Senne Lammens the wrong way, Mateta had to do the same again after being adjudged to have touched the ball twice by VAR.",
      "More chances followed for Palace in the first half with Matthijs de Ligt and Luke Shaw called upon to make huge interventions to prevent further damage.",
      "Amorim could be seen anxiously pacing in the mixed zone during the half-time break, taking a moment before what would have been his most significant talk to his players, hoping to avoid a repeat of Monday's hopeless showing against the 10 men of Everton.",
      "Whatever he said worked, helping United end a run of three without a win to move up to sixth, above Palace who are denied a place in the top four. Amorim also becomes the first United boss to win at Selhurst Park since Ole Gunnar Solskjaer in 2020.",
      "Manchester United must figure out a way to overcome their Jekyll and Hyde complex. Ruben Amorim's side were nowhere near it in the first half at Crystal Palace.",
      "They lacked energy, belief and any ideas as they were under the pump at Selhurt Park. But then a moment of magic from Joshua Zirkzee changed it all.",
      "Across the season, United's starts have been fairly positive and where United have typically found their joy.",
      "However, they have failed to sustain their early displays. In recent performances, United have been far more effective in the second half; their problem, though, is their slow starts.",
      "The defensive numbers are where the difference is stark. Across United's first 11 games this season, in the first half, they had an expected goals against of 5.71. This changed in the second half where that number nearly doubled to 11.07.",
      "However, in their last two games, at Palace and in defeat to Everton, United have a first-half expected goals against of 1.26, while after the break, this number massively decreases to 0.26.",
      "It's important to note that in both games United fell behind in the first half, therefore were naturally more attack-minded in the second period.",
      "However, there's a clue in the numbers that Amorim's team are a different side when they go ahead early, like they did eight times in their first 11 league games, compared to when they concede early on.",

      "\"And we improved a lot because of the quality of Josh in the second half. And that is important for him to understand. That is not just the goal. We played better because Josh played better in the second half.",
      "\"I just said to the players [at half time] we need to be more alive, and you can feel that. So if you are more alive, you are in more places, you are near the ball more often and I think everyone did that.",
      "\"But we also need to understand that the opponent was tired in the second half. And when you increase the rhythm and the opponent gets tired a little bit, suffers a goal right away, you feel that we had the control of the game and that's it.\"",
      "Asked whether he felt his side would come back, Amorim said:",
      "\"I felt that because I had the feeling, if you see the last plays of the game, they were struggling so much to take the ball out of the box.",
      "\"And you can feel it, the way they move, that they were getting tired for the second half.",
      "\"We talked about that and again, our pace in the first half, intensity, we cannot play like that in the Premier League.",
      "\"So we increased that and I had the feeling, we had the feeling that if we score one goal, this is going to change completely.\"",
      "\"Ismaila Sarr has been, by far and away, one of Crystal Palace's standout players since he arrived at the club from Marseille in August 2024. The numbers speak for themselves: 66 appearances, 20 goals, 10 assists.",
      "\"But he may well have played his last game of the year for Oliver Glasner's side.",
      "\"The Senegal forward went down under a challenge from Luke Shaw inside the first four minutes at Selhurst Park and made a motion with his hand as if to suggest he had twisted his ankle. He lasted just over half an hour more, before being replaced by Eddie Nketiah.",

      "\"I can't remember a big chance from open play in the whole game.",
      "\"We are not fresh enough in many games and the energy level dropped, but I think we made it just harder for us because we conceded these two goals.",
      "\"In the situation we are in now, it looked like it was tough, but I think, at the end, we tried everything.",
      "\"We had a few set-plays as well, an even better situation, the free-kick. But we missed it, they took it, and so that's why we lost it.\"",

      "\"Those things can change how you see teams, but we need to improve in a lot of things. We need to close our goals because we are scoring goals. It's an issue, it's not about the defenders, but about the team and the way we feel our danger near the box.",

      "Amorim, chasing a goal against Everton after Idrissa Gueye's red card, replaced left wing-back Patrick Dorgu with Diogo Dalot, naturally a full-back, in a like-for-like change that left United devoid of any attacking threat down that side.",
      "Palace's attack-minded wing-backs, Daniel Munoz and Tyrick Mitchell, have been a cornerstone of Oliver Glasner's success, while United only have Amad Diallo in that mould and Amorim admits that will have to change for the team to improve.",

      "\"It is these characteristics that in time we will try to get to be a better team. If we are the perfect set-up to play in this way, not yet. But like any team, we need time to put the right characteristics into every position.\"",
      "The United boss dismissed direct comparisons with Palace ahead of Sunday's game but acknowledged Glasner's side are outperforming them at the moment as they sit in 10th.",
      "Although Palace are fifth in the table, they are only two points better off than United, who could go above them with a win at Selhust Park.",

      "\"You don't say that all 4-3-3 teams play in the same way. We play in a different moment, we defend in a different space, we attack in a different way. They are just doing things better than us.\"",

      "\"For me, it's impressive to see. We compared it [their last meeting] to where they are now. I think their work-rate is much higher than it was last year and then they get the reward.\"",
      "Amorim admits he would have preferred to bring on a more attacking alternative to Dalot at Everton with no other options available on his bench, but stuck with the same shape nonetheless.",
      "\"Ruben Amorim has a question to answer,\" he said. \"Bringing Dalot on over there in front of Luke Shaw? I don't quite see it. You have five at the back, why? Embarrassing.",
      "\"This should be like the Alamo. Really quick, high-tempo passing side-to-side, getting into good wide areas, putting crosses in, getting bodies in attack, sustaining attacks. It's very slow from United. There is no presence in the box whatsoever.\"",
      "\"Ruben Amorim feels like the first manager I've seen who sticks with a system rather than an idea of how to play,\" Carragher said. \"It feels like the formation is his baby and to not change it or alter it in certain situations like that [against Everton], I don't understand how you can stick with it so steadfastly.",
      "\"It's not about losing the three points against Everton, I think it is one of those moments where people will really question the manager. He will take a lot of the blame.\"",
      "At Sporting, Amorim's wing-backs were attacking outlets vital in making his system work. In his final full season in charge, in 2023/24, Nuno Santos, Geny Catamo and Ricardo Esagio, his three most-used wing-backs, contributed a combined total of 26 goals or assists between them in league games alone.",

      "The struggles of Amorim's wing-backs raise further questions about Amorim's devotion to his system. If they are not contributing offensively, then what are they really bringing to the table? It is just one of many questions for their under-fire head coach.",

      "Sunday 30 November 2025 09:19, UK",
      "Just when there was a bit of momentum at Manchester United, and doubts about Ruben Amorim's much-maligned formation were vanishing - then came the loss to Everton.",
      "It was a game that put the Amorim project back to square one in terms of how much faith there is in this specific era. Gary Neville said the complacency shown by United will erode confidence in the team - but there was just as much criticism about the 3-4-2-1 system.",
      "Despite playing over 75 minutes with an extra player after Everton's Idrissa Gueye was sent off, Amorim chose to stick with his preferred formation - keeping three centre-backs and two wing-backs on the pitch.",
      "\"You have five at the back, why?\" asked Neville, while Jamie Carragher added: \"I don't understand how you can stick with something so steadfastly in a situation like that. You don't need three [centre-backs] there.\"",
      "Next up for United is a trip to Crystal Palace, where Oliver Glasner has made a success of that 3-4-2-1 formation. The Eagles sit in the top five - where United want to be - having won a trophy via the FA Cup, which has eluded Amorim in his year in charge thus far.",
      "Glasner's formation has even survived the departures of Michael Olise and Eberechi Eze, highlighting how the system thrives on more than a few top-level players - it is a collective structure that works. How United need that at the moment.",
      "\"We have found a system where we are very balanced, where we can threaten the opposition goal and also be very consistent in our defence,\" said Glasner last month. \"That's why we stick to it.\"",
      "So why does it bring success for Palace, but less so for Man Utd? Using the Palace boss' own words, we take a look at Glasner's formation from back to front.",
      "The back three of Chris Richards, Maxence Lacroix and Marc Guehi have marshalled things brilliantly in front of Dean Henderson - one of the statistically best goalkeepers in the division.",
      "Palace have the Premier League's second-best defence in terms of goals conceded - and are one of only two backlines to let in a single-digit goal tally after a dozen Premier League games. The other team is league leaders Arsenal.",
      "The central areas are the most important part of the pitch for Glasner, as it is the most vulnerable area for any side. \"The centre determines the game. It starts with the back three - you're talking about the core,\" he says.",
      "One of the reasons three centre-backs is a good system in the modern Premier League era is the way wide centre-backs protect the 'half space'.",
      "It is the area where most dangerous attacks emerge from via defence-breaking passes or runs - these areas are also described as the 'pockets'.",
      "As Glasner says: \"The half runs, which is where most of the assists are coming from, in defence you have to protect these areas.\" And Palace appear to have the right profiles in those centre-back positions.",
      "No Premier League defender has more interceptions this season than both Richards and Lacroix, while only six defenders have won more possession in the defensive third this season than Palace captain Guehi.",
      "Even Neville spoke about the importance of positioning the three centre-backs on Monday night against Everton. \"Matthijs de Ligt is much more dominant and certain in that central role,\" he said. \"When Harry Maguire plays, De Ligt goes into the right channel where he gets caught out and doesn't look comfortable.\"",
      "Palace have perfected their back three, but on the basis of recent displays, United need a bit more work.",
      "The four in Palace's midfield are divided into two areas: the wing-backs and the two sitting midfielders.",
      "The flying wing-backs of Daniel Munoz and Tyrick Mitchell are critical to this Palace team because of the intensity they bring.",
      "Munoz is the most intense player in the Premier League, clocking nearly 14.5km per game at high intensity this season - nearly 1.5km more than the next-best player.",
      "It is not a singular thing to Munoz, it is part of Glasner's instructions. That's because Mitchell, on the opposite flank, sits fifth for current Premier League players in the same metric. Palace are the only team in the Premier League with two players in the top dozen top-flight players in this category.",
      "What is more striking is how Palace's wing-backs compare to Man Utd's wing-backs. For example, Munoz runs further per game at high intensity than Amad Diallo and Noussair Mazrouai combined.",
      "Meanwhile, Mitchell is streets clear of what United's left-wing-back options, Patrick Dorgu and Diogo Dalot, produce.",
      "Then comes the importance of the two sitting midfielders - rotated between Adam Wharton, Daichi Kamada and Jefferson Lerma - who set the tone for Palace's play.",
      "\"The central midfielders, we call them the quarter-backs,\" says Glasner. \"They are responsible for the speed of our attacks, if we go forward or keep possession. So they are important.\"",
      "Palace and United's midfield set-up is similar. In Wharton, the Eagles have their own version of Bruno Fernandes - a player who sits and tries to break the opposition's lines.",
      "\"That's why the manager wants me there,\" said Man Utd captain Fernandes on Monday night. \"To have more of the ball and control the tempo of the team.",
      "\"He [Amorim] knows I can run a lot, press high and get my body back there when we need to get to the box and defend.\"",
      "Meanwhile, the other sitting midfielder - Kamada for Palace or Casemiro at Man Utd - sits and shares defensive duties with the other player.",
      "For Palace, the system works defensively as well as offensively. Kamada sits in the top five midfielders this season for tackles won per 90, with a slightly better record than Chelsea's Moises Caicedo.",
      "But for United, how Casemiro and Fernandes cope in midfield as a two has been much-maligned. They were cut wide open at times against Everton on Monday, with Gueye showing signs of frailty within the opening minutes.",
      "But even after the Everton midfielder's red card, the Toffees still had joy playing around United's midfield two - with the winning goal coming from direct passing through the middle of the pitch.",
      "But it is not just Palace's sitting midfielders who play Glasner's side progress the ball centrally - the two No 10s also help to create overloads in the most important area of the pitch.",
      "\"We try to play with the two No 10s narrow, with the striker - so we can maybe have eight players in the centre to combine together,\" says Glasner. Those eight players being three centre-backs, two sitting midfielders, two attacking midfielders and one striker.",
      "\"You can't pass with one touch if players are 30 or 40 yards away from each other in the distances,\" Glasner added. \"You need connections on the pitch.\"",
      "The two No 10s, normally Ismaila Sarr and Yeremy Pino in this Palace team, are helping them to break through the middle of the pitch by creating a four-man box with the sitting midfielders. No matter if you face a team with two or three in midfield, you will always have an overload.",
      "But they also assist in pinning opposition teams back. \"Some teams mark our No 10s with their No 6s [defensive midfielders] - so they're pretty much playing with a back six,\" says Glasner.",
      "If a busy striker like Jean-Philippe Mateta can occupy multiple centre-backs at once - as he tends to do - then the two No 10s need to be marked by midfielders. If they aren't, the likes of Sarr and Pino have more space.",
      "All those eight players being central can create a very congested area in the middle of the park, but Glasner has plans for that. \"If the opposition closes the middle, then somebody can drop out and you can overload the wing,\" he says.",
      "Palace's front three is a perfect system set up by the right profiles. \"You need pocket players, you need runners - the mix makes it,\" he says. The pocket players are Sarr and Pino, the runners are Munoz and Mitchell.",
      "It allows Mateta to do what he does best - be physical and hold the ball up. Mateta ranks top for the number of hold-ups in the Premier League this season.",
      "\"You need the right players for it,\" says Glasner about his attack. \"You can't ask all the players making runs in behind if they are used to playing in the pockets.\"",
      "United tried to address these forward areas in the transfer window, forking out big fees for Benjamin Sesko, Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha.",
      "They fit the United structure in places, as has been seen this season in bright attacking moments. But any injuries - such as Cunha and Sesko's this past week - and there are holes. And they are holes that Palace do not seem to have.",

      "Luke Shaw came under fire as Man Utd's defeat to Everton raised more questions of Ruben Amorim's system; Gary Neville on Luke Shaw against Everton: \"He's ambling. You can't do that. He should be running forward every single time\"",
      "By Nick Wright, Oliver Yew and Adam Smith",
      "Tuesday 25 November 2025 15:06, UK",
      "Gary Neville slammed Luke Shaw's lack of intensity as Manchester United slumped to another low under head coach Ruben Amorim with their 1-0 defeat to 10-man Everton.",
      "The 30-year-old, playing as the left-sided centre-back in Ruben Amorim's back three, was singled out for \"ambling\" forward as Manchester United tried, and failed, to recover from a goal down.",
      "Shaw is one of four Manchester United players, along with Matthijs De Ligt, Bruno Fernandes and Bryan Mbeumo, to have started every Premier League game this season. It has been a rare period of availability for a player dogged by fitness issues.",
      "Last season, he only completed 90 minutes once in the Premier League, having only done so seven times in the campaign before that. You have to go back to 2022/23 for the last time he managed to feature consistently across a full season.",
      "Staying fit has proved a major challenge for Shaw.",
      "Once a marauding full-back with the energy to shuttle between the two boxes, his physicality is not what it used to be. His lack of intensity against Everton riled Neville with Manchester United trailing against 10 men and needing a goal.",
      "\"You have Shaw, [Leny] Yoro and [Matthijs] De Ligt behind the ball,\" he said on co-commentary. \"Shaw is getting forward more, but he's ambling forward, let's be clear. He's been bugging me for the last 20 minutes. He's ambling. You can't do that.",
      "\"He should be running forward every single time. I don't care. Yoro, I have a little bit more sympathy for but Shaw? That's a waste of time. I don't care. It's not conning anybody. I'm not having it.\"",
      "Shaw's physical decline can be seen in the numbers. There is a caveat in that he has been used in a role which requires less running under Amorim, as a centre-back rather than a full-back, but the drop-off in many areas predates the head coach's arrival.",
      "Shaw's sprints and kilometres covered per 90 minutes have followed a downward trend and his attacking output has also declined.",
      "Shaw has steadily contributed fewer crosses, goal involvements and chances created over the course of the last five seasons.",
      "Gary Neville says Manchester United's performance in the 1-0 defeat to 10-man Everton \"smelt of complacency\" and will \"erode trust\" in Ruben Amorim's team.",
      "Despite Shaw's limitations, Amorim's system once again came under intense scrutiny.",
      "Still trailing, Amorim made changes to try and get back into the game, bringing on Diogo Dalot for Patrick Dorgu and Kobbie Mainoo for Casemiro. They were like-for-like substitution as the United boss left Shaw, De Ligt and Yoro on the pitch, sticking with his three-at-the back system for the full 90 minutes.",
      "It was a move that left many Man Utd fans frustrated, particularly bringing on the right-footed Dalot to play in front of Shaw as the pair ended up getting in each other's way on Manchester United's left side.",
      "\"You have to have urgency and make the pitch as big as possible, and you have to put as many players as possible in forward areas,\" said Neville.",
      "\"Ruben Amorim has a question to answer,\" he added.",
      "\"Bringing Dalot on over there in front of Shaw? I don't quite see it. You have five at the back, why? Embarrassing.",
      "\"This should be like the Alamo. Really quick, high-tempo passing side-to-side, getting into good wide areas, putting crosses in, getting bodies in attack, sustaining attacks. It's very slow from United. There is no presence in the box whatsoever.\"",
      "Once again, Amorim being wedded to his 3-4-3 formation and his reluctance to change in-game proved costly for United. His devotion to playing three at the back has come to be seen as a flaw, especially when trying to chase games.",
      "Questions will be asked again of Amorim and his flexibility. It's hard to see why he kept his three central defenders on the pitch and didn't throw extra attackers on against Everton when it was obvious they were lacking a focal point in the absence of the injured Benjamin Sesko and Matheus Cunha, something which was also highlighted by Jamie Carragher after the game on Monday Night Football.",
      "\"Ruben Amorim feels like the first manager I've seen who sticks with a system rather than an idea of how to play,\" Carragher said. \"It feels like the formation is his baby and to not change it or alter it in certain situations like that [against Everton], I don't understand how you can stick with it so steadfastly.",
      "\"If you have to stick with the system, put a midfielder in defence, which we have seen managers do in the past, because you are going to have so much of the ball.",
      "\"It's not about losing the three points against Everton, I think it is one of those moments where people will really question the manager. He will take a lot of the blame.\"",
      "Amorim still has Lisandro Martinez to return from injury. The Argentina international will likely slot back into the left-sided centre-back role, but Shaw looks unsuited to playing at wing-back and Amorim's other options are also underperforming.",
      "At Sporting, his wing-backs were attacking outlets vital in making his system work. In his final full season in charge, in 2023/24, Nuno Santos, Geny Catamo and Ricardo Esagio, his three most-used wing-backs, contributed a combined total of 26 goals or assists between them in league games alone.",
      "Amorim's wing-backs at Manchester United have contributed half as many goals or assists across a similar number of league games.",
      "And nine of their 13 goals and assists, roughly 70 per cent, have come from Amad Diallo, with the others used in the position, Dorgu, Dalot, Noussair Mazraoui, Harry Amass and Tyrell Malacia, only managing four between them in a combined 67 starts at wing-back.",
      "The struggles of Amorim's wing-backs raise further questions about Amorim's devotion to his system. If they are not contributing offensively, then what are they really bringing to the table?",
      "It is just one of many questions for their under-fire head coach, who can add Shaw's decline to a growing list of problems.",
