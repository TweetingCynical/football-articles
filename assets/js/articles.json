      "John Terry is auctioning the kit he wore during his infamous penalty slip and miss in the 2008 Champions League Final against Manchester United. The former Chelsea captain is clearing out his wardrobe of some iconic pieces of memorabilia in order to raise money for charity.",
      "In addition to the strip from that notorious moment, a more difficult goodbye may come as he parts ways with the kit which he wore when lifting the 2011/12 Champions League trophy. Terry was in his full Blues kit despite being suspended for the penalty shootout win itself.",
      "While Chelsea fans may be queuing up for a Champions League-winning top, perhaps there will be some United fans in search of the grass stains left in Terry's 2008 shirt after his slip. After being called upon to take the decisive penalty following Cristiano Ronaldo's miss, Terry slipped as he hit the ball and struck the post in Moscow. The Red Devils went on to win in sudden death.",
      "The bidding will begin at $5,000 (£3,700) for that shirt. Others have a cheaper entry with the tops from the final game of his Chelsea career and his last career match listed at $1,000 (£740). They are among more than 20 items that the 45-year-old is putting up for auction with proceeds going to charity.",
      "The funds will be directed to the John Terry Foundation, which supports a range of charities nationwide. \"My foundation is going to benefit with two very close to my heart foundations that are in desperate need of the money,\" Terry said. \"It's going to a great cause, so all the support is going to be welcome.\"",
      "More high-ticket items will also be available. Terry is also set to let go of his first Premier League winners' medal.",
      "The Chelsea icon captained his team to a dominant title win under Jose Mourinho, ending the club's 50-year wait for the title. The medal could raise up to £75,000.",
      "Shirts that Terry has claimed in some of his biggest battles will also be available. Match-worn tops from Thierry Henry, Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi will all go under the hammer.",
      "The sale will take place on Wednesday, December 31 via an online auction house, Goldin. A spokesperson said that the collection was a testament to Terry's truly 'remarkable' career.",
      "\"When considering the greatest defenders in the history of English football, John Terry's name can often be found at the forefront of the conversation,\" a statement read. \"A stalwart and imposing presence on Chelsea's vaunted back line, a position he held with the club for nearly 20 years, Terry quickly was anointed as the club's skipper under newly arrived manager Jose Mourinho, a decision that proved wise beyond measure.",
      "\"Among the lots is Terry's Premier League medal from his first win in 2004-05 and some of the shirts exchanged with opponents, including Lionel Messi",
      "\"In addition to his domestic achievements, Terry established himself as an accomplished lynchpin on the backline of England's National Team, appearing in 78 international competitions while representing the Three Lions and scoring six goals total.",
      "\"Goldin is proud to present a remarkable array of memorabilia sourced directly from John Terry's personal collection, testaments to various stages of Terry's illustrious and accomplished career.\"",

      "Marcus Rashford has been a hit during his Barcelona loan spell - and the majority of the Catalan club's fans want the club to sign the Manchester United man permanently next summer according to a vote held by a Spanish outlet.",
      "Rashford joined the La Liga giants in the summer, with United and Barca agreeing to a deal that includes an option for Barca to sign him permanently at the end of the season. The Spanish giants will have to pay around £26million to keep Rashford in Catalonia beyond May 2026.",
      "The 28-year-old has scored seven goals and provided 11 assists in 24 appearances under Hansi Flick. Such form has placed him in contention for an England call-up for the World Cup next summer Flick, according to reports in Spain, wants to retain Rashford's services, and the club are actively working towards a deal.",
      "Mundo Deportivo hosted a poll which revealed 54.6 per cent of Barca fans would be in favour of keeping Rashford at the club, by activating the purchase option in his loan. A total of 6.3 per cent reckon that sporting chief Deco should hold off until the end of their season.",
      "That leaves almost 40 per cent of fans in opposition to signing Rashford permanently.",
      "For his part, Rashford appears content at Camp Nou. The Manchester United academy product has discussed his future ambitions with the club. He told SPORT in an interview: \"I'm adapting very well to the club and the city. From the moment I arrived, I felt that everyone welcomed me very well.",
      "\"For me, the reason I'm here is to help the team win trophies. Last season was fantastic, but in life, everything happens very quickly, things change, and the goal is to repeat the successes. I'm totally focused on this.",

      "\"The purpose is to win. Barca is a huge, fantastic club, built to win titles.\"",
      "With time off this Christmas, during La Liga's winter break, Rashford delivered presents to children at two Barcelona Foundation centres. The forward explained: “I grew up in this type of environment.",

      "He came on for Luke Shaw in the 88th minute and assisted Ruben Amorim's team in securing crucial three points, drawing them level with Chelsea in fifth place. The left-back had spent the latter part of last season on loan at PSV Eindhoven after failing to impress Amorim.",
      "Despite appearing destined for a summer departure, he has since been brought back into the United fold. Following six consecutive matches on the substitutes' bench, Malacia finally made his comeback at Old Trafford against Newcastle.",

      "Kobbie Mainoo has, for the first time, been considering leaving Manchester United on a permanent basis, a new report claims. Mainoo, 20, has been left disgruntled by his lack of game time under Ruben Amorim.",
      "The midfielder's only start this season came in United's humiliating Carabao Cup loss to Grimsby Town in August. Mainoo pushed to leave his boyhood club on loan towards the end of the summer transfer window, but the Red Devils weren't willing to let him go.",
      "Amorim was set to turn to Mainoo for United's game at Aston Villa last Sunday before he suffered an injury in training. The calf problem also ruled him out of Friday's hard-fought 1-0 win at home to Newcastle.",
      "With just a few days until the January window opens, it's emerged that Mainoo is once again weighing up a departure - but this time not on loan. The i Paper report that sources close to the 10-time England international say that he's been exploring a permanent exit, with a number of clubs across Europe registering their interest.",
      "Napoli could be one of them. Former Old Trafford team-mates Scott McTominay and Rasmus Hojlund have reignited their careers in Naples, and Mainoo has been tipped to be next.",
      "United, however, would only entertain a huge offer and are lacking depth in midfield. Bruno Fernandes is currently out injured and Casemiro has only played 90 minutes three times for United this season.",
      "Unless the Red Devils were able to sign one of their top midfield targets - Elliot Anderson, Carlos Baleba or Adam Wharton - selling Mainoo would leave Amorim with only Mason Mount and Manuel Ugarte as backups to Fernandes and Casemiro. Ugarte has started United's last two games while Mount picked up an injury on Boxing Day.",
      "Before beating Newcastle, Amorim said that Mainoo was the club's 'future', appearing to rule out a January exit. \"That is my feeling,\" the Red Devils boss said. \"He just needs to wait for his chance and everything can change in football in two days.\"",
      "Amorim went on to say: \"If we are not getting someone, it is hard to leave. Even with a full squad we are shorter [in terms of players] for something that can happen here so it's going to be hard for someone to leave the club if we don't get a substitution.\"",

      "\"I don't think that helped at all, no. Then if he's right or wrong, whatever, but I think for us it was a bit of like, 'Oh, here we go again. Another headline.'\"",
      "Amorim's remarks followed a disappointing display against the Seagulls at Old Trafford in mid-January. Bruno Fernandes managed to equalise, but the suffering persisted as Kaoru Mitoma and Georginio Rutter compounded their woes.",
      "The United boss has come under fire for his side's displays this season, but last term it was the players who bore the brunt of criticism after struggling to reverse their fortunes despite a managerial change.",
      "Amorim made waves with his assessment when he branded his squad as \"maybe the worst\" in the club's 147-year existence.",
      "He said: \"In [the past] 10 games in Premier League, we won two. Imagine what this is for a fan of Manchester United. Imagine what this is for me.",
      "\"We are getting a new coach who is losing more than the last coach. I have full knowledge of that.",
      "\"We are the worst team maybe in the history of Manchester United. I know you [media] want headlines but I am saying that because we have to acknowledge that and to change that. Here you go: your headlines.\"",
      "Eriksen's deal at Old Trafford ran out in the summer before he joined Wolfsburg on a free transfer.",
      "He featured 22 times under Amorim during his 107 matches at United, netting once. Fifteen of those appearances came in the Premier League, though he was named in the starting XI on just six occasions.",
      "Eriksen said: \"Yeah, he came in with his ideas. He tried to change things as you still see, tried to get it his way.",
      "\"Certain players for certain positions, for a certain style of play, that's how he sees success. He has to change a lot because the players were not used to that system.",
      "\"Also, historically, United always liked a different system. And yeah, he's been very honest and also, yeah, honest with me from the beginning. Very, very, very honest, I would say.\"",

      "The life of a football manager can be a lonely one, especially when the threat of the sack looms large. So Wayne Rooney might have been forgiven for feeling somewhat abandoned when his wife, Coleen, was nowhere to be seen as he faced the axe at Plymouth this time last year.",
      "It was almost exactly one year ago this Sunday that Rooney coached the Pilgrims for the last time. The Devon outfit travelled to Oxford on December 29, 2024, in desperate need of points to improve their Championship relegation odds against a rival in similar circumstances.",
      "Many managers might expect to turn around and see a few familiar faces in the crowd for moral support on such occasions. And yet Coleen was nowhere to be seen during Rooney's make-or-break moment.",
      "Instead, she was taking in some festive football at Goodison Park, where she watched her local team take on Nottingham Forest instead. Rooney's better half posted a picture from the directors' lounge on Merseyside, almost 300 miles from her hubby.",
      "In the end, it proved to be the final nail in the coffin for Manchester United legend Rooney. A 2-0 loss at Oxford ended up being his last test as Plymouth chief, and he promptly left the club just two days later.",
      "He departed Home Park with five wins and 14 losses from 25 games in charge. And though not as bad as his stint with Birmingham City, he nonetheless departed Plymouth having failed to build any more credibility as a coach.",
      "Any legacy was only damaged further when his successor, Miron Muslic, did a superior job in his five months as a replacement. The Austrian even suggested Plymouth would have survived had he been appointed sooner.",
      "It was always established that Coleen wouldn't be moving with Wayne to the south coast. Stability for their four young sons remained the priority, though she acknowledged the long-term setup was nothing compared to his time as coach of DC United.",
      "\"We see him a couple of times a week, which is good,\" Coleen told the Sunday Mirror in September 2024. \"He went to America, so this is a bonus because even though it seems like far away, it's easier to get to than Washington, DC.\"",
      "She continued: \"We thought long and hard about it (moving to Devon) but with the kids it didn’t work. Kai’s now in Year 10 and just starting GCSE prep, and everything’s going well with football, and the other boys are all settled at school.",
      "\"So it didn’t seem fair on the children to pick them up and take them away, and start in a whole new place. It’s manageable. It’s life. Other couples and families have similar situations and have to get on with it.\"",
      "One year on from his Plymouth departure, there's no sign of a new coaching position on the horizon for Rooney. However, he may have to pick a position closer to home if he expects his adoring wife to be on hand for the big occasions.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Amorim switched to a back four and was rewarded when Patrick Dorgu scored his first goal for the club. The United boss also used academy graduates Jack Fletcher and Tyler Fredricson off the substitutes’ bench, which also contained fellow youngsters Tyler Fletcher, Shea Lacey and Bendito Mantato.",
      "United legend Rooney was happy to see his former side hang on and claim three points, which left them sixth in the Premier League, and academy players given a chance to impress, but couldn’t hide his overall feelings. “I was worried when I saw the performance, if I’m being honest,” Rooney said on Match of the Day.",
      "“The manager changed the formation and he went with a back four, which a lot of people have been asking for. I know they didn’t concede a goal but they didn’t really look comfortable and Newcastle put them under pressure, especially in the second half.",
      "“And when I look at the squad and the bench, what they’ve got there, they really need players in to try and help them to challenge and get into the top four.",
      "“It’s great to see the young players on the bench and getting that opportunity, but it needs to be at the right time as well. It’s not sustainable at all. They need players in. They’ve obviously lost some important players and Bruno is a big loss.",
      "“They had 33 per cent possession in the Newcastle game – and I know when those fans go to Old Trafford they want to see the team with the ball, they want to see them entertaining, getting crosses into the box and getting shots off. It was a poor performance, but they found a way to win.”",
      "United are understood to be chasing a midfielder in the January transfer window, with Everton’s James Garner and Atletico Madrid’s Conor Gallagher among the targets. The club have previously considered Crystal Palace’s Adam Wharton and Brighton’s Carlos Baleba after spending £200million in the summer transfer window to bolster their attack.",
      "Amorim has already ruled out panic-buying in January after losing captain Fernandes to injury. “What we cannot do is to reach January and try to do everything in urgency and make mistakes and then [it’s] ‘here we go again’ with a lot of mistakes,” Amorim said last week.",
      "“I’m not going to get [together] with [club chiefs] Jason [Wilcox] and Omar [Berrada] and say: ‘We need a lot of players.’ Because we have a plan.",
      "“If we have to suffer, the club comes first. Of course, we are in a moment where we need points but we need to find solutions and we are going to continue with our plan. You can feel in this moment that we are going to struggle, but we will see. We have to deal with it.”",

      "Sir Alex Ferguson believes academy players are still the future of Manchester United despite the likes of Scott McTominay and Alejandro Garnacho being sold. Both former Carrington stars have left the club in the last year with fellow academy boy Kobbie Mainoo potentially following suit in January.",
      "McTominay graduated from the United youth team in 2013, working his way up the ranks until he made his senior debut in 2017. The Scottish midfielder made 255 appearances for the club, scoring 29 goals and providing eight assists before moving on to Napoli in 2024.",
      "Former manager Ferguson was full of praise for McTominay during his time at the club. He insisted the playmaker would go on to become one of United's biggest stars.",
      "\"Scott McTominay is now emerging as one of Man United's big players,\" Ferguson told the Scottish FA in 2021. \"When you watch Man United pick their team for a big game, McTominay's name is in it. He's a good character, a great trainer. I know a little bit about the boy and I think that's the background.\"",
      "Just three years later, McTominay left United and became Italy's newest hero as he helped Napoli win the Serie A title at the first time of asking.",
      "Now, fellow midfielder Mainoo may be following in his former teammate's footsteps and Fergie will likely be left saddened by this. Speaking at a golf event in 2024, the iconic manager insisted that the likes of Mainoo and Garnacho - who is now at Chelsea - are the beating soul of the club.",
      "Ferguson said: \"It's the foundation isn’t it? It's the heart and soul of what Manchester United has been since the days of Sir Matt Busby, who started the whole process of trusting young players playing.",
      "\"They're young. What they’re showing at the moment, the composure and confidence to play in the first-team, and not be daunted by it. In a way, it shows you the kind of courage they have.\"",
      "Ferguson's thoughts are clear on the sale of Mainoo from these comments - sell him and you are losing the true meaning of Manchester United.",
      "Despite rumours circling that the England international is set to leave Old Trafford, current boss Ruben Amorim claims he isn't the one who wants to see Mainoo go. Speaking before United's 1-0 win over Newcastle on Boxing Day, the Portuguese boss insists the midfielder will not leave.",
      "Amorim said: \"Kobbie Mainoo will have the opportunity he has all the time. He played in different positions - we talked about the position of Casemiro, he can do that.",
      "\"If you play with a three, he can play like we did in the last game with the position of Mason Mount, he can play there. He is going to be the future of Manchester United, that is my feeling, he just needs to wait for his chance and everything can change in football in two days.\"",
      "Reflecting on United's depth in midfield, the 40-year-old added: \"If we are not getting someone, it’s hard to [let Mainoo leave]. We are shorter.",
      "\"Even with a full squad, we are shorter with something that can happen here. We are a club with a big responsibility. We are dealing with all these issues and in everybody’s head, we need to win every game, there are no excuses. So it’s going to be hard to leave the club if we don’t get a substitution.",
      "\"A few days before [his injury], we were talking about Kobbie doesn’t have the minutes he deserves or needs. Then there’s an opportunity, and Kobbie is not there.",
      "\"Sometimes, it is bad luck and during this year, we have some moments with a bit of bad luck.\"",

      "Manchester United are preparing for a crucial period on and off the pitch. The Red Devils secured a hard-fought 1-0 win over Newcastle United on Boxing Day and another three points over Wolves on Tuesday would end a tough year on a high note.",
      "Ruben Amorim must have wondered whether he would see in 2026 as United boss at one stage, as the team lurched from one disaster to another at the start of the season. However, the Portuguese coach has steadied the ship, with United looking in better shape than 12 months ago.",
      "Next year could be another one of change at Old Trafford, with the futures of numerous players up in the air. With the transfer window looming, here's a round-up of the latest United news…",
      "Roma have submitted an official offer to sign striker Joshua Zirkzee, according to various reports. The Rome club are said to have tabled a loan bid with an obligation to buy.",
      "However, while the Dutchman is evidently not in Amorim's long-term plans, the coach must consider whether he would be prepared to let him go as early as next month, given Bryan Mbeumo and Amad Diallo are away at the Africa Cup of Nations.",
      "While a loan offer is believed to have been received, United are said to be taking their time to mull over their options before making a firm decision on Zirkzee's future. The 24-year-old came off the bench against Newcastle but struggled to get into the game as United tried to protect their lead.",
      "Mbeumo of Cameroon and the Ivory Coast's Amad are due to meet in a group match on Sunday, having won their opening games. It's entirely possible that both countries could go deep into the tournament, ruling them out of United action until late January, leaving Amorim and United with a tricky decision to make.",
      "Incoming signing Cristian Orozco has described moving to United as a dream come true. The Colombian teenager is due to join the club when he turns 18 in July.",
      "The Red Devils have cast their net far and wide as they seek to build for both the present and the future. They signed 18-year-old Diego Leon from Paraguayan side Cerro Porteno earlier this year and have since moved for Orozco.",
      "The 17-year-old midfielder plays for Fortaleza CEIF in his homeland and captained Colombia U17s to the South American Championship final in April. The youngster recently visited Manchester and was impressed with what he saw.",
      "He said: \"It went really well, to be honest. I was looking around the city. Everything was beautiful. I was able to see the facilities, the stadium. I'm truly fulfilling a childhood dream. It was a wonderful experience.",
      "\"My expectation right now is to learn English a lot. I realised it’s very important. I want to arrive, learn, and adapt as quickly as possible. That’s what’s required to demonstrate my level there, what I can do.",
      "\"I know that with my abilities, I can be key, with the strength and technique I have. I’m very young and I need to adapt.\"",

      "Kobbie Mainoo has been served a harsh dose of reality as speculation continues around his Manchester United future. The 20-year-old has become one of Old Trafford's most discussed figures this season, despite barely featuring on the pitch.",
      "Mainoo hasn't been given a single Premier League start under Ruben Amorim this term and has only started once across all competitions in a shocking Carabao Cup exit to League Two outfit Grimsby Town back in August. Despite his limited game time, the England international continues to attract attention from European giants Napoli and Bayern Munich, who are reportedly keeping tabs on his situation.",
      "Mainoo even sought a loan switch late in the summer transfer window, raising doubts about his standing in Amorim's plans. The Portuguese manager insisted this week that the youngster remains integral to his vision for the club, even branding him the \"future of Manchester United\".",
      "But former Premier League striker Dean Saunders believes the hype around Mainoo has spiralled beyond what he's actually achieved, whilst questioning whether Amorim truly means what he says.",
      "Speaking on talkSPORT, the ex-Wolves and Wrexham boss said: \"I've never known a player get so much airtime and so much press without kicking a ball. He's in the back pages of the paper every day. Mainoo this, Mainoo that and he hasn't started since Grimsby away in the cup when they got knocked out.",
      "\"They were horrendous against Grimsby and I think sometimes, as a manager, you watch that game and you think, 'that's it, he's never playing again. He [Amorim] has played Fernandes in that role with Casimero and he [Mainoo] has not got the chance to play.",
      "\"It won't go on forever, because he's played for England and he's shown his potential. He scored a couple of good goals, but I don't think he does know that position. He [Amorim] has just gone, 'I've had enough of this every day. Mainoo this, Mainoo that. I'll put it to bed by just saying he's not going anywhere.'\".",
      "The harsh assessment stands in stark contrast to Amorim's public support, after the United manager dismissed any talk of a January departure.",
      "He said: \"He's going to be the future of Manchester United, that is my feeling. He just needs to wait for his chance and everything can change in football in two days.",
      "\"Kobbie Mainoo will have the opportunity he has all the time. He played in different positions; he can do that [defensive midfield] position, he can play if we play with three, he can play like we play in the last game - the position of Mason Mount in this game [against Villa].\"",
      "Amorim subsequently dismissed speculation about Mainoo departing Old Trafford next month, saying: \"If we are not getting someone, it is hard to leave. Even with a full squad we are shorter [in terms of players] for something that can happen here so it's going to be hard for someone to leave the club if we don't get a substitution.\"",
      "However, despite being recently sidelined with a calf injury, there are ongoing queries about why Mainoo hasn't been able to secure a spot in Amorim's starting line-up. Saunders suggests that a short-term loan move overseas could be beneficial for the midfielder, identifying Italy as an ideal place for development.",
      "He added: \"He's shown potential, but this is Man United we're talking about. They're trying to win everything they enter. They're a massive club and in that number six position, you have to smell danger from all angles.",
      "\"I think, for a young lad to learn that, it's difficult unless he's playing every week. I think you're doing good if you go to Napoli or somewhere like that, one of these Italian teams.\"",

      "Ex-Premier League referee Keith Hackett has backed Anthony Taylor's decision not to award Newcastle a penalty for a handball by Manchester United captain Lisandro Martinez.",
      "During the match on Boxing Day, a shot from Fabian Schar hit the stand-in United captain inside the six-yard box. Despite Martinez's claims to referee Taylor, that the ball had struck him in the stomach, replays suggested his arm had made contact with the ball.",
      "Video assistant referee Stuart Attwell reviewed that incident, but decided against any further action. Hackett, who previously served as the general manager of Professional Game Match Officials Limited (PGMOL), has now given his verdict on the contentious decision.",
      "Speaking to Football Insider, Hackett said: \"The referee has to judge if the action by the player is deliberate when deciding that an offence has taken place, not every time the ball comes into contact, is it an offence. There is sufficient doubt in this action not to award a penalty kick.\"",
      "\"Schar hits it, his arm is up above his head, and it's stretched. Is it because he's pushing [Malick] Thiaw?",
      "\"That might just save him. He's actually wrestling with the other Newcastle centre-back; his arms are already there.",
      "\"If Thiaw is nowhere near him, then that's definitely a penalty. I think the fact that he has just had a wrestle with the other centre-back might just save him.\"",
      "Neville also revealed what the VAR officials made of the controversial moment. The pundit added: \"He's saying the context is because there's another situation whereby he's fighting with another player, and his arm's are already up there and he's just not got back down.\"",
      "Main commentator Peter Drury explained: \"They are calling it mutual contact between Martinez and Thiaw. And that's essentially the explanation for the fact that there won't be a penalty.\"",
      "Following United's triumph, head coach Ruben Amorim heaped praise on Martinez. He said: \"I think he's a guy with a lot of character. He's really good on the ball, and that came with the quality that he has.",
      "\"He played [in the] World Cup, he won [the] World Cup. He's used to that stress, and he showed today that he's a top player, and sometimes people talk about the way he defends the box because he's a small guy, but today he did really well against a team that just has tall players.\"",
      "Yet when he was in turn pressed on whether the squad would be stronger with Martinez maintaining his fitness, Amorim declined to single out individuals. He responded: \"No, I don't want to say that because - if we don't have more points - it's because of the team, not because of a specific player.\"",

      "Much has changed in the 12 months since Marcus Rashford first signalled that he wanted to move on from Manchester United. The 28-year-old is currently experiencing something of a career revival with Barcelona, but his outlook once appeared far less encouraging after a breakdown in his relationship with United head coach Ruben Amorim.",
      "Following 18 months of poor form and with Amorim determined to shape his team around a strong, central No. 9, Rashford found himself at a crossroads. Despite being born and raised in Manchester, Rashford had carried ambitions that stretched beyond Old Trafford.",
      "Barcelona was always his dream move abroad. However, getting to the Camp Nou was never going to come easily and demanded both patience and resilience.",
      "When the January transfer window opened, talks with the Catalan giants took place, but a deal was never reached. Instead, Rashford sealed a loan switch to Aston Villa on deadline day, viewing it as a chance to rebuild his damaged standing.",
      "He managed just four goals in 17 games at Villa Park, yet his overall contribution in the West Midlands proved sufficient to reignite Barcelona's interest later that summer. \"I just believe that things happen when they're supposed to happen,\" Rashford told ESPN in October.",
      "\"It's not the first time I spoke with Barcelona about potentially coming here, but for whatever reasons it didn't happen in the past and now is my opportunity to make it happen. I feel like there's no time like the present now. So I just take things day to day.",
      "\"The key thing for me is just to continue to improve because when you retire, you're going to miss everything - the good stuff, the bad stuff - you're going to miss it about the sport. Every day I just take it day by day and just try to improve from the day before.\"",
      "Those comments underline Rashford's mindset - an aspect of his career that was often examined closely during his spell at United. The England forward frequently faced criticism for his conduct on and off the field, but a renewed sense of purpose and a quieter dedication to his work appear to have transformed perceptions and produced clear results.",
      "\"I was clear on my preference from the beginning,\" Rashford explained after completing his move to Barcelona in July. \"It didn't work out in January so I went to Aston Villa and enjoyed a good period there. I'm very grateful for the opportunity to play there.",
      "\"The summer came around very quickly, it was time to make another decision. My choice was easy.\"",
      "Life at Barcelona has suited Rashford well so far. He has established himself as a near constant presence in Hansi Flick's line-up, sitting out just one of Barcelona's 25 fixtures across all competitions to date.",
      "Statistics back up his importance. Rashford has delivered nine goals and 11 assists, with his influence especially evident in the Champions League, where he has been directly involved in seven goals in six matches.",
      "That resurgence has also helped him reclaim a regular role with England. As Barcelona are widely expected to make his loan deal permanent next year, Rashford's call to leave last January - no matter where he landed - looks increasingly astute.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Patrick Dorgu will have to be on his best behaviour against Wolves next week if he wants to avoid a suspension. The full-back, who scored the winner in the 1-0 clash with Newcastle United on Boxing Day, is currently walking a tightrope.",
      "The 21-year-old has totted-up four yellow cards this season after 18 games. Collecting five before reaching the 19-match threshold of a campaign triggers an automatic one-match ban for any Premier League player.",
      "This means Dorgu - and his manager for that matter - face a tense 90 minutes against Wolves in their next fixture, with three teammates unavailable due to the Africa Cup Of Nations and Bruno Fernandes amongst those still side-lined through injury.",
      "After being dropped and openly criticised by Ruben Amorim just a few weeks earlier, Dorgu has forced his way back into their starting XI with an assist (vs Aston Villa) and goal (vs Newcastle), helping United feel significantly more secure despite their depleted squad.",
      "\"He needs to be calmer playing the game,\" Amorim said during a press conference when asked about what Dorgu needs to work on, adding: \"You can feel the anxiety every time Patrick touches the ball. I can feel the anxiety.\"",
      "After that press conference, Dorgu was dropped from the United starting line-up. He was subsequently named among the substitutes for the following five fixtures, before then being brought back into the fold against Villa.",
      "Speaking to reporters after the final whistle against Newcastle, Dorgu addressed how he's handled recent criticism. He said: \"Of course, it's never nice to get criticism, but you will always get it as a player.",
      "\"And you need to react well to it, and I think I've reacted well in the last couple of games.\"",
      "He added: \"The manager spoke about my confidence a few weeks ago. I just looked inside and tried to understand what he meant. And I just tried to build myself up.\"",
      "Now perhaps a guaranteed starter for the Wolves clash on December 30, Dorgu has carved out a fresh role in the revamped line-up. But one mistake against the bottom-placed team will see the Denmark international suspended for a crucial trip to Leeds United.",
      "Amorim will be desperate to have the ex-Lecce man available for the journey to Elland Road. A few weeks back, however, he might not have anticipated relying on him so heavily.",
      "Brought back into the fold out of necessity due to three teammates being away at AFCON, Dorgu has, on initial evidence, seized his opportunity. The last thing he'll want now is to lose his grip on the starting place and hand a similar chance to another squad member under Amorim.",
      "Dorgu arrived at the club courtesy of Amorim during last season's January transfer window, with United paying £30million for his services. In his time wearing United's colours, the wing-back has racked up 38 appearances.",
      "His strike against Newcastle marked his maiden goal for the club, complementing his three assists along the way. Dorgu, who has earned 12 senior caps for Denmark, is also tied to Old Trafford until 2030.",

      "Ayden Heaven was showered with praise after earning the man of the match award in Manchester United’s backs-to-the-wall win over Newcastle on Boxing Day. Heaven is just 19 years old and was making just his 13th appearance for the club in a new position, but shone at Old Trafford.",
      "United were without Bruno Fernandes, Harry Maguire and Matthijs de Ligt for the game, while Mason Mount also went off injured. Meanwhile, Bryan Mbeumo, Amad Diallo and Noussair Mazraoui are away at the Africa Cup of Nations, forcing Ruben Amorim to adapt.",
      "The home side took the lead through Patrick Dorgu’s stunning volley from a Diogo Dalot long throw-in and then managed to weather the storm of Newcastle pressure. Key to their victory was the performance of Heaven, who slotted in at right centre-back, despite being left-footed.",
      "Amorim has been stubborn in his use of a 3-4-2-1 formation since becoming United boss, but did adapt against Newcastle, with a rare back four often resembling a back six in the latter stages of the match. It helped United keep just their second clean sheet of the season and their first since a 2-0 win over Sunderland on October 4.",
      "Former United defender Gary Neville added: “Manchester United hung in there. Heaven was absolutely brilliant. Those Newcastle players… four or five of them collapsed to the ground at the end. Heaven has been the man of the match.”",
      "“This guy (Dorgu) here helped us get there, so thankful to everyone that helped us. It was different, I was playing on the right side, obviously my weaker foot. The manager, we play loads of formations with him, whatever he does we know it’s going to work, you saw today. I’m so proud of the team.”",
      "Amorim praised his players for toughing out the win despite seeing little of the ball and was particularly happy with his young defender. “I'm really pleased with Ayden. You can feel that he’s improving every game,” he said. “He's young, but you don't feel that he has a good game and then he slows the game or the thinking during the game.",
      "“No, you feel that he’s improving during the game. I think he was not playing, but he trained really well. You just need to train really well to be ready when the opportunity comes. So, in this moment, if you continue to play like that, it's going to be really hard to take his place.”",

      "It's been a tough year for Manchester United fans. The Red Devils finished 15th - their worst position in Premier League history - lost a European final and failed to win a domestic trophy.",
      "Ruben Amorim's credentials are still being questioned on a weekly basis, and on paper, many would argue that he's in charge of the weakest United squad of the post-Sir Alex Ferguson era. That's despite another injection of £215million over the summer.",
      "One player who's still shining, however, is Bruno Fernandes. That is until he got injured.",
      "Red Devils captain Fernandes went off at half-time with a hamstring problem during last Sunday's toothless 2-1 loss away to Aston Villa. His absence was immediately felt, as United showed little goal threat.",
      "It was the same during their Boxing Day victory over Newcastle. Although Patrick Dorgu's strike gave them a 1-0 home win, Newcastle fired off six more shots and had treble the amount of touches in the opposition box.",
      "Matthijs de Ligt came third with 36 votes while Casemiro earned 28. In fifth place, Harry Maguire got 19 - likely thanks to that special moment at Anfield.",
      "The gulf between Fernandes and his team-mates is undeniable and Amorim must find a solution when he's missing. That's not just for this season either, as the 31-year-old has left the door open to a departure from Old Trafford next summer.",
      "As for when he'll return from his injury, Amorim said earlier this week: \"I don't want to say. I have an idea but let's see.\"",
      "The United boss even told his players that Fernandes was 'impossible to replace'. \"I said that this morning to the team,\" Amorim revealed. \"We need to take the good thing - if there is a good thing on that - that a lot of people need to step up and understand we cannot rely on one player for everything.",
      "\"Sometimes we rely on Bruno for organisation and the creation. We have lost Bruno on set-pieces, Bryan [Mbeumo] and Amad on set-pieces, so this is massive for the team. But it is an opportunity for other players to step up and show the leadership that we need in the team.\"",

Heaven earned man of the match honours for his display at Old Trafford after helping the Red Devils secure a clean sheet in their victory against the Magpies.",
      "The 19-year-old said: \"It was [big]- finally a clean sheet. We've been waiting for this for a couple of weeks. I'm just so happy. I'm so thankful for everyone who helped us [win].",
      "\"As Manchester United, we belong in Europe, and we want to get back there next season. We can push for the top four, possibly push for the league; anything is possible. We are just going to keep trying.",
      "\"The manager, we play loads of formations with him, whatever he does, we know it's going to work, you saw today. I'm so proud of the team.\"",
      "However, Roy Keane has suggested United are not quite prepared to challenge for the title. The club's former skipper said during Sky's match coverage: \"[Heaven] mentioned there about winning titles - they're not quite ready for that, but you have to start somewhere.\"",
      "Heaven has previously voiced his confidence that United will return to UEFA competitions next season. Following their 4-1 triumph over Wolverhampton Wanderers in early December, he said: \"I don't think anyone can stop us when we play like this. We want to win as many games as possible. Hopefully we can be in Europe next season, which I think we'll do.\"",

      "There were plaudits aplenty for Manchester United players on Boxing Day, particularly the defenders who had managed to dig in and preserve a backs-to-the-wall clean sheet that secured a 1-0 win against Newcastle. It was a win that temporarily moved them up to fifth and showed a different side to their game.",
      "United had just 24% possession in the second half and had to do plenty of defending, with Ayden Heaven and Lisandro Martinez excellent. However, throughout the siege, there was a sense of calm that isn't always associated with Ruben Amorim's side, particularly when under pressure.",
      "The return of Martinez might have helped in that regard, but 23-year-old goalkeeper Senne Lammens has also had an impact, even if his statistics aren't yet making that clear after his £18.2million move from Royal Antwerp. This was just Lammens' second clean sheet in 12 games.",
      "His celebrations at the end showed he was desperate to get the shut-out and although he didn't have to make any outstanding saves, he was secure in goal. There was one excellent claim under a high ball in injury time that relieved the pressure and earned him a pat on the back from teammates.",
      "It was hard to imagine United defending with the poise they did had a different goalkeeper been behind the defence. Andre Onana's form fell apart at Old Trafford and his inconsistency too often spread panic and uncertainty to his teammates. Altay Bayindir has had his moments, but has shown vulnerabilities under the high ball.",
      "Lammens is still learning as a goalkeeper and has just 106 senior appearances to his name, with only 55 of those in Belgium's Pro League before his move to United. It was a signing based on potential, but he has faced little competition in goal, and the improvement when he plays is clearer in the way his teammates have reacted to him than in the saves he has made.",
      "That is something one of United's greatest ever goalkeepers has noticed. Speaking before the Newcastle game, Peter Schmeichel was full of praise for Lammens.",
      "\"He's only 23 years old, he's come in and there's calm at the back four, there's not this chaos where they don't want to pass him the ball back to him. They trust him. He seems a very, very confident young man,\" Schmeichel told Viaplay.",
      "\"And also, one more thing I like about him is he is so quick in turning the game. So when he gets the ball, he's not afraid of kicking the ball up the other end or throwing the ball up. Starting a counter-attack very quickly.",
      "\"I don't think he pays too much attention to the results of the goals he conceded. I think he's living a dream and everyday he comes in and he wants to learn and he wants to improve and I think he's done really well.\"",
      "That calmness was a trait noted by Boxing Day matchwinner Patrick Dorgu. “I think he helped with his calmness,\" he said. “He’s very calm and he’s talking a lot to the defenders and helping everyone on the pitch with his communication.",
      "“He’s just calm and he tries to take responsibility to help us defenders as well. He came in well and he’s doing really well, so he just needs to keep going.”",
      "Lammens is yet to make an error leading to a goal this season and, as Schmeichel touched on, he is happy to go long with his kicking when required. The sound of Old Trafford getting agitated as United try and fail to play out from the back has gone, with their new No.1 better at picking his moments to go short.",
      "It hasn't been a faultless start, and Lammens would have expected to do better with a couple of Bournemouth's goals in the 4-4 draw at Old Trafford earlier this month, but he is still inexperienced for the role he is now fulfilling and there has been plenty more in the positive column in his first few months at the club.",

      "Much has been made of Ruben Amorim's view of the Manchester United academy in recent days. It was only earlier this month when the United boss was having to defend his selection and reasoning behind overlooking the potential of youth.",
      "That changed at Old Trafford on Boxing Day night with United naming five academy graduates on the bench and bringing two of them one. Tyler Fredricson was given the final few minutes as the Reds saw out a 1-0 victory while Jack Fletcher played the second half in place of the injured Mason Mount.",
      "It was a show of faith from Amorim in Fletcher given the manager could have called upon Joshua Zirkzee to fill the second striker role. But the Dutchman was introduced off the bench, just as he had been at Villa Park a few days prior.",
      "United had impressed in the first half with Patrick Dorgu's fine goal the difference at the interval but the Reds were forced to defend deep in the second period to see out the contest, meaning Fletcher didn't get on the ball as much as he would have liked. But after adjusting to the pace of the contest, the 18-year-old didn't look out of place in senior football.",
      "“I think it might take a while to adjust to the tempo and intensity,\" said Fletcher after the game. \"It was really tough out there, heavy on the legs, 45 minutes of defending, I think we did well. Hopefully, I can showcase my talent more.”",
      "His showing will provide food for thought for United, who will be looking to strengthen their midfield given the likely departure of Casemiro at the end of the season. There are question marks over Kobbie Mainoo's long-term future while Manuel Ugarte has struggled to make his mark since arriving at Old Trafford.",
      "Fletcher, son of former United man Darren, has a bright future ahead of him and is likely to gain more minutes over the coming weeks. He might not be ready for the rough and tumble of top flight football every week just yet, but the experiences over the next few months could mean he's ready sooner rather than later. Amorim has made a point of not promoting academy talents the sake of it, so when one does come into the fray it's all the more impressive.",
      "\"Jack did a very good job,\" said Amorim of Fletcher. \"It's a very important moment for any kid. He's going to hear from his father. He's going to talk a lot about a lot of things, but he needs to calm down and just praise the kid because he's really humble, works really hard, and he deserves this.\"",

      "Ruben Amorim would have been under no illusions as to the challenges facing him when he took on a job the size of Manchester United just over a year ago. But he was perhaps not ready for the constant headaches he would have to deal with. The nature of United means there are very few quiet days.",
      "At the moment, he is currently juggling several issues. An injury crisis is plaguing his team with absentees across the defence and midfield stretching the squad to the maximum. Speculation surrounding the future of Kobbie Mainoo continues to rattle on as does talk of Bruno Fernandes leaving.",
      "This is on top of the everyday challenges of pushing this club back to the heights they once reached. But one topic which has gone under the radar in the past couple of weeks is the contract situations of Casemiro and Harry Maguire.",
      "Both men will be free agents at the end of this season, as things stand. The Brazilian has a clause in his contract which United can utilise to extend his stay in Manchester but Maguire will need to agree to a new deal if he is to stay beyond 2026.",
      "Maguire and Casemiro can both negotiate with overseas clubs freely from the start of January as they enter the final six months of their current deals. In his pre-Newcastle press conference on Christmas Eve, Amorim was asked by MEN Sport if any further talks had taken place with the duo over their Old Trafford deals.",
      "\"No, there is no decision, we have a lot to do,\" Amorim responded. \"We need to understand what is going to happen in the next season because we need to understand there are European games, and what we are doing.",
      "\"So we have so much to do at this moment. We are not thinking about that. We will think just think about the next game.\"",
      "He added: \"I'm really happy with them, but I don't know what is going to happen, so we will see what will happen until the end of the season, what position we will be, and then we will see.\"",
      "Whether more is going on behind the scenes than we know remains to be seen, but at least in the case of Maguire, the decision could be being made easier by Ayden Heaven.",
      "The Arsenal academy graduate traded the Emirates Stadium for Old Trafford last January. A matter of weeks prior to that switch he made his first-team debut for the Gunners against Preston North End in the Carabao Cup but it was clear this would be the exception, rather than the rule.",
      "Gabriel and William Saliba are Mikel Arteta's first choices when fit, regardless of who is coming through the academy. Clearly, Heaven felt chances would be easier to come by in Manchester and so it has proved.",
      "In the first half of the year, he was called upon four times in the Premier League. An injury picked up against Leicester City scuppered his momentum and it was obvious this season would be a big one for him.",
      "When he was initially brought in to cover injuries, he underwhelmed which was to be expected given he is still only 19 and he had not played much football since the injury at the King Power Stadium.",
      "But in recent weeks, with Maguire and Matthijs de Ligt out, Heaven has impressed. Against Aston Villa he shone in the centre of the back three and again on Boxing Day, he showed maturity above his years.",
      "The Englishman is starting to look fully at home in the defensive line and his form is beginning to alleviate the pressure surrounding Maguire. Amorim will be the first to say Maguire is more than just a competent defender, he is part of the leadership group and this cannot be understated.",
      "However, Heaven is showing on the pitch he is capable of performing to the required level, even though he is still a teenager. He is a realistic successor to Maguire.",

      "But speaking on his YouTube channel, Romano hinted that United have not fully given up the chase.",
      "“Man United I can guarantee that even in their internal talks at the club have not stopped discussing the name of Carlos Baleba, because Baleba is still seen as an ideal solution by Ruben Amorim and people at the club,\" he said.",
      "“So Baleba together with Adam Wharton at Crystal Palace, together with Elliot Anderson at Nottingham Forest are seen as the ideal midfielders for Amorim. Baleba is super appreciated by Man Utd.",

      "Manchester United defender Patrick Dorgu believes he has responded to Ruben Amorim's criticism with his recent performances. At the end of November, Amorim said he could feel \"anxiety\" from Dorgu when he picked up the ball, and suggested the Denmark international needed to perform better.",
      "\"He needs to be calmer playing the game,\" said Amorim to a question about what Dorgu needs to improve. \"You can feel the anxiety every time Patrick touches the ball. I can feel the anxiety.\"",
      "Following that press conference, Dorgu lost his starting place. He was named on the bench for the next five matches, but he was recalled to the starting team against Aston Villa last weekend.",
      "The 21-year-old assisted Matheus Cunha for United's goal in the Midlands and delivered another improved performance against Newcastle, scoring in the first half with a brilliant volley to claim three points for United.",
      "Dorgu spoke to reporters following the full-time whistle and was asked how he dealt with the criticism. \"Of course it's never nice to get criticism, but you will always get it as a player,\" he said. \"And you need to react well to it, and I think I've reacted well in the last couple of games.\"",
      "He added: \"The manager spoke about my confidence a few weeks ago, so I just looked inside and tried to understand what he meant. And I just tried to build myself up.\"",
      "Dorgu sought advice from the leadership group in the dressing room, which includes Bruno Fernandes, Diogo Dalot, Noussair Mazraoui, Lisandro Martinez, Harry Maguire and Tom Heaton. \"My teammates help me as well,\" he added. I spoke to Bruno [Fernandes] and some of the leader group in my team. They just try to help me on a daily basis to grow in confidence in training and stuff. \"",
      "Dorgu continued: \"We have players at AFCON and injured players, so this is my chance to show I belong in this team, and I feel like I'm doing it in the last couple of games, so I just need to keep going and try to keep the manager happy.\"",
      "Dorgu played on the right, in a more prominent position, against Newcastle. \"I've done that in my old team as well, so it's nothing new to me. I'm just happy to score the goal,\" he said. \"I've been training to shoot more in the games and I think I hit it really well. I'm really happy that it went in. I knew already a few days ago [about playing on the right], so I just tried to remember how to play there.",
      "\"It's the same, just you come inside to your stronger foot, so sometimes it's even easier to attack and connect with the teammates, so I find it really easy.\"",

      "The striker scored both goals as the Italian champions defeated Cremonese on Sunday, in his latest statement for the Naples-based side. He has now scored seven goals in 19 appearances this season, just three less than the ten he managed for United last term.",
      "Hojlund moved to italy on a season-long loan on deadline day after United opted to spend big on Benjamin Sesko. The deal includes an obligation for Napoli sign the Denmark international on a permanent deal if they qualify for the Champions League.",
      "Following the win in Cremona, Hojlund took to Instagram to post a message to his fans. Posing with the Serie A Man of the Match trophy, he wrote: \"Christmas came late this year.\"",
      "Bryan Mbeumo, Patrick Dorgu, Andre Onana and Ethan Wheatley were among the thousands who liked the striker's post within the first hour. Napoli boss Antonio Conte went on to praise his striker following the win, in comments that spoke volumes about the player's standing in his side: \"Hojlund is a player who, first of all, is very young, but above all, has a lot of room for improvement.",
      "\"He's becoming a dominant player in that position. He's very connected to the team. In my style of football, everyone knows that strikers have a very important and unique role.",
      "\"The road to success? Annibale said that there isn't a road, it has to be built. We are doing it despite the great difficulties.\" He added: \"We're celebrating a wonderful year where we achieved something extraordinary and unexpected.",
      "\"We crowned the Scudetto with the Super Cup, where we beat Milan and Bologna. It was a wonderful year, full of emotions. Napoli, when you win, makes you celebrate in a different way. We're up there in the league and we're trying to stay close to the top spots. This season, we're facing several challenges, and we're always facing them with courage.\"",
      "Hojlund form comes amid doubts about United's current attacking options. Sesko has managed just two goals since his move from RB Leipzig, and Joshua Zirkzee has been tipped to secure a return to Italy in January.",
      "However, Amorim has admitted that a move for any of his players next month will only be completed if they can bring in a replacement. \"It's going to be hard for someone to leave the club if we don't get a substitution,\" he said.",
      "\"We are a club with a big responsibility. We are dealing with all these issues and in [the media's] heads, in my head, in everybody's head, we need to win every game. It doesn't matter. There are no excuses.\"",

Taking to social media, Malacia posted a series of images of himself from the game, with him quoting the bible verse Romans 8:18, which reads: “For I consider that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory that is to be revealed to us.”",

      "Manchester United's strong end to 2025 could see them enter the New Year full of confidence, as well as a desire to hit the January transfer market with some intent.",
      "Ruben Amorim's tactical changes have seen an uptick in performances, even if the results haven't always been there, which has put a top-four finish in their sights.",
      "However, given how thin the squad can appear at times, Man United may look to bolster their options and increase the quality with a few key additions.",
      "Plenty of midfielders have been rumoured with a switch to Old Trafford, while a few forwards have also been touted with a possible transfer in the weeks ahead.",
      "Antoine Semenyo is among the names of targets who have been linked with a move to Man United this winter. With a £65m release clause in his contract that can be triggered in the opening ten days of the market, a switch seems likely.",
      "However, rivals Manchester City seem to be leading the race for his signature, though there could bea late move from Liverpool, making it a challenge.",
      "Verdict: Unlikely - With Man City leading the race, it seems like a lot would have to happen for him to end up at Old Trafford instead.",
      "As Man United line up a way to improve their midfield ranks, the form of Elliot Anderson has naturally put him on their radar. The Nottingham Forest star has become a regular with England, and still has room to grow further.",
      "Verdict: Unlikely - With Forest embroiled in a relegation fight, it seems likely that they would want to keep their best talent. His valuation may well surpass £100m, making it tough to put in a bid in January, so attention may have to turn towards the summer.",
      "Another midfield option is Conor Gallagher, who has previously been linked with United. The England international has been in and out of the team for Atletico Madrid, and may be open to a return to the Premier League.",
      "Verdict: Possible - If Gallagher agitates for a move before the World Cup, then he may be available. With a contract until 2029, he may not be the cheapest option, but it would be less pricey than the others.",
      "Ruben Neves is one of those players who has been linked to United for years now. However, the possibility of him landing at Old Trafford seems more likely now, as he enters the final six months of his contract at Al-Hilal.",
      "Verdict: Possible - While Neves may not be the long-term solution, he is in his peak years and could offer plenty for the next few years. He has lots of quality, and with only a few months left on his deal, he could be available.",
      "Brazilian youngster Breno Bidon has been linked with a move to Manchester United for the January window. The 20-year-old is a central midfielder and could grow plenty in the future.",
      "Verdict: Possible - Breno Bidon is available if Man United decide to make an offer. It remains to be seen if they push for him, however, with some more immediate impact needed.",
      "Another of the midfield options available to Man United is Adam Wharton. The Crystal Palace star has impressed in the past two years, since making the step up to the Premier League from the Championship.",
      "Verdict: Unlikely - Given the large price tag Palace would slap on Wharton, it seems unlikely that United will land him this January. A move in the summer could be possible, depending on a few factors.",
      "United pushed to sign Carlos Baleba in the summer transfer window, but decided against a deal. Links have appeared again since, suggesting he is still a target and could be on their radar.",
      "Verdict: Unlikely - Much like Wharton and Anderson, Baleba is likely to cost over £100m, making him a difficult target to land this January.",
      "A slightly different option in the January transfer market is Angelo Stiller. The Stuttgart star is being tracked by plenty of teams after impressing at the very top level.",
      "Verdict: Unlikely - With the World Cup coming up next summer, it seems as though Stiller will only entertain a move after the tournament. While United could look towards completing a deal, they may have to wait.",
      "Coming through as a Man United academy product, James Garner is an option linked with a return in the weeks ahead. He has been a versatile option for Everton since making a switch and could offer plenty.",
      "Verdict: Possible - It's the sort of move that could happen, but it's unclear just how much Everton would ask for, and whether that would match the quality he can truly offer."

      "Wayne Rooney has explained why he was impressed by Jadon Sancho's cameo performance for Aston Villa. Sancho left Manchester United during the summer transfer window to join Villa on loan for the remainder of the season.",
      "Saturday night saw Villa in action against Chelsea in the Premier League, with Sancho given the chance to feature against his former club from the bench, having spent last season on loan at Stamford Bridge.",
      "Chelsea had the option of signing Sancho on a permanent deal from United in the summer, with a £25million obligation to buy clause included in the loan agreement.",
      "However, the Londoners opted not to activate the clause and instead paid a penalty fee to United, which saw Sancho return to Old Trafford.",
      "This was despite Sancho playing a key role in helping Chelsea win the UEFA Conference League title, with the on-loan United star scoring in the final against Real Betis. However, he was not in the squad that travelled to the United States for the FIFA Club World Cup.",
      "Sancho had been restricted to just 13 appearances for Villa before making a cameo from the bench against Chelsea on Saturday night.",
      "The 25-year-old was not able to feature against United last week due to loan rules preventing players from going up against their parent clubs.",
      "Rooney has explained why he was impressed by Sancho's performance from the bench for Villa, with the United legend noting the forward's lack of regular minutes this term.",
      "\"Jadon Sancho came into this as well, and we haven't seen much of him this season, but I thought he was excellent when he came on,\" Rooney said on BBC's Match of the Day.",
      "\"Getting the ball, driving with the ball and committing the Chelsea defenders and then they had runners, they had Morgan Rogers making runs in behind.\"",
      "It remains to be seen what the future will hold for Sancho at United, with his contract at Old Trafford set to expire next summer.",
      "The Reds do have the option of extending the deal by a further 12 months should they wish to do so, which could give United the opportunity to receive a fee for Sancho in the summer rather than see the former Borussia Dortmund star leave on a free transfer.",
      "The next opportunity Sancho will have to star for Villa will be when they travel to face Premier League leaders Arsenal on Tuesday night at the Emirates Stadium, in their final match before the New Year.",

      "A few months ago, Ruben Amorim said even the Pope couldn't convince him to change his system at Manchester United, but on the second day of Christmas, he gave in to popular demand. If a back three is United's past, then could this back four be their future?",
      "Amorim had been teasing the idea of a change of shape in recent weeks and had worked on it in training, so the ghosts of Christmas hadn't visited him in his sleep and brought about an epiphany, yet however it came about, Old Trafford delighted in the reversion to a flat back four and the end of wing-backs.",
      "There is enough material from the past 13 months to give Amorim nightmares, but this change in formation delivered a change in fortunes as well. After six weeks of blowing chance after chance to go fifth in the Premier League, they finally took it. It might last for less than 24 hours, but it shows that this side is in the hunt for a Champions League spot, even if they spent almost the entire second half on the back foot.",
      "When the teamsheets dropped at Old Trafford, it didn't look like it was the night when Amorim changed his ways, but Patrick Dorgu was right-wing rather than left-wing back. That change caught Newcastle by surprise.",
      "On the touchline, Eddie Howe and Jason Tindall debated a solution, while the Newcastle analysts sat in the press box tried to work out what was happening. The shrugging of shoulders showed they hadn't been expecting this.",
      "A few weeks ago, Amorim had talked of the anxiety he could feel whenever Dorgu was on the ball, so when he watched his left-wing-back-cum-right-winger settle over a dropping ball 16 yards from goal, he probably didn't expect to see a sweetly struck volley whizz past Aaron Ramsdale and into the corner of the net.",
      "Dorgu visibly grew in confidence after that. He forced Ramsdale into a smart save soon after and contributed defensively with one thunderous tackle on Lewis Hall that earned a chest bump from Casemiro, but the loss of Mason Mount to injury at half-time turned this into a rearguard effort.",
      "Fabian Schar saw a shot deflected just wide from a corner and was furious when Newcastle were denied a penalty when his shot was blocked by the arms of Lisandro Martinez. Lewis Hall hit the bar from distance and Anthony Gordon dragged a shot narrowly wide.",
      "United's attacks were few and far between. Benjamin Sesko clipped the top of the bar with a left-footed shot in his last action before being replaced by Joshua Zirkzee, part of a double change that saw Leny Yoro come on, giving the hosts the chance to drop into a back six when required.",
      "And it was needed regularly as Newcastle piled on the pressure. Diogo Dalot and Dorgu were wingers dropping in at full-back as Yoro and Luke Shaw went narrow.",
      "Senne Lammens saved from Joelinton and plucked a cross-shot from Joe Willock out of the air. Anthony Gordon should have done better than swiping a shot over after good work by Harvey Barnes, Schar looped a header onto the roof of the net and then Lewis Miley fired wide from 12 yards.",
      "It summed up Newcastle’s wastefulness in the final third as wave after wave of attack came to nothing. It wasn’t convincing from Amorim’s side, especially after the break, but after four successive defeats without Bruno Fernandes in the Premier League, victory was all that mattered.",
      "Fernandes was in the directors' box to watch his teammates go into battle without him. Amorim had talked of how difficult it was to replace the captain on Christmas Eve and with Mount missing as well, United's creativity is being tested. That this game finished with Jack Fletcher and Tyler Fredricson on the pitch, as well as the lesser-spotted Tyrell Malacia, said everything about the resources Amorim now has at his disposal.",
      "He will need to continue to find solutions over the next few weeks, but the fist-pumps that greeted this victory showed how valuable it was, and the sight of Lisandro Martinez blowing kisses to the Stretford End was a reminder that at least one key man is back in the groove. The Argentine was vital to this defensive effort and proved to be the perfect stand-in for Fernandes.",

      "Ruben Amorim said Manchester United's backs-to-the-wall win against Newcastle United was one of his best as Old Trafford boss after his injury-hit side held on to a valuable three points against the Magpies. United were down to the bare bones after losing Mason Mount at half-time and they had to hold on during a second-half onslaught to earn a 1-0 win that temporarily moved them into fifth in the Premier League.",
      "Although United have produced more convincing performances under Amorim, the Portuguese head coach hailed it as one of his best wins during his 13 months in charge and insists the spirit they showed could be valuable in spreading belief through the squad.",
      "Asked if the win was one of his most enjoyable, he said: \"Yeah, especially if you see the second half, we managed to defend sometimes with a back six, but we suffer together, and that is a good feeling. I felt we are here talking about the game, and if we always have this spirit, we are going to win so many games. We need to feel we can win games without playing so well and win with spirit and togetherness.\"",
      "It was just a second clean sheet of the season and Amorim felt the luck was on United's side against Newcastle when it has deserted them at other times this season. \"The feeling is good but if you compare to other games we suffered so much more today, but in certain moments we put everything on the line,\" he said. \"We’re defending every cross, trying to push out the box, that is a good feeling to have but we had so many games we controlled much better and conceded a goal.\"",

      "It's going to be a strange experience for Bruno Fernandes on Boxing Day when he sits down to watch Manchester United and is unable to influence the action. Whether Fernandes has his hamstring wrapped up in the warm at home, or has his big coat on at Old Trafford, he isn't going to know what to do with himself when his teammates take on Newcastle United.",
      "Fernandes is 31 and a veteran of 683 appearances for club and country, but astonishingly, he has missed only four games in his career through injury. Two of those were for Portugal in the March 2019 international break and then two for United in May 2024. He has missed two more games due to illness, in 2017 and 2022, and that is it.",
      "It's a remarkable injury record, but one that was unlikely to last as age caught up with the durable Portugal international. The sight of him clutching his hamstring just before half-time at Villa Park on Sunday confirmed Ruben Amorim's worst fears.",
      "Amorim will offer an update on Fernandes' fitness when he holds his pre-Newcastle press conference on Christmas Eve, but he is expected to be absent for around a month. Amorim might also offer a few clues as to how he might replace his captain, although he is arguably irreplaceable.",
      "Fernandes has again been the beating heart of this team this season. Playing slightly ahead of Casemiro, he has 12 goal involvements in 17 Premier League games and set the tone for performances, as he often does.",
      "Amorim has two issues now. How to replace Fernandes in the team and who to hand the captain's armband to. Let's start with the first problem.",
      "In truth, there aren't a lot of options. Kobbie Mainoo will be frustrated that a calf problem has denied him the chance to earn a first start of the season. Amorim has said all season that the 20-year-old is competing for a place with Fernandes, but now he finds himself sitting next to him in the physio's room.",
      "That only leaves Casemiro and Manuel Ugarte. The former will return to the team after serving a suspension on Sunday and perhaps the Uruguayan will keep his place. That would likely mean Casemiro being given the freedom to get forward in the way that Fernandes does.",
      "Amorim ruled out Lisandro Martinez as a regular midfield option last month, but the Argentine looked good there at Villa Park. He is only going to play the holding role, however, and is currently competing with Ugarte for that position.",
      "If Amorim wants a more progressive option, he could turn to 18-year-old Jack Fletcher, who came on for the final 17 minutes on Sunday, or drop Mason Mount back from his position as one of the No. 10s. That would mean Joshua Zirkzee coming in alongside Matheus Cunha. The knock-on effect is that United would have no senior attacking options on the bench.",
      "Amorim will also have to decide who to hand the captain's armband to. It was Diogo Dalot who took it for the second half at Villa and he described that as \"a very proud moment\".",
      "The only game Fernandes hasn't started this season was the Carabao Cup defeat to Grimsby, when Harry Maguire was skipper, but Maguire is now absent with a thigh problem. In the Premier League, the last time Fernandes didn't start was at Brentford in May, when Luke Shaw was captain. Maguire and Diogo Dalot were also missing that day as focus turned to the Europa League.",
      "At Wolves, a couple of weeks earlier, it was the now departed Victor Lindelof who captained United. The only other time Fernandes didn't start in the league last season was against Newcastle nearly a year ago, when Lisandro Martinez wore the armband. That's four different captains in four Premier League games without Fernandes in 2024/25.",
      "The fact that Dalot was captain while Shaw and Martinez were on the pitch would suggest he is now ahead of them. He is in the six-man leadership group named in the summer, alongside Fernandes, Tom Heaton, Noussair Mazraoui, Martinez and Maguire. Of that six, Dalot is the only guaranteed starter on Boxing Day and the only other player from that group who could feature is Martinez.",
      "Casemiro was suspended against Aston Villa but has some leadership experience. He has captained Brazil on 18 occasions, although never skippered Real Madrid. He has worn the armband twice from the off against United, in a 4-0 Premier League defeat to Crystal Palace and a 3-0 Carabao Cup loss to Newcastle.",
      "So everything points to Dalot getting the captaincy in Fernandes' absence. Who replaces him in midfield might be a little trickier.",

      "Welcome along to our latest Manchester United question and answer session with senior club writer Tyrone Marshall, who covers the daily goings-on at Old Trafford.",
      "It's been another busy week in M16. A 4-4 draw with Bournemouth last week, a 2-1 defeat to Aston Villa on Sunday, speculation around the future of Kobbie Mainoo and an injury for Bruno Fernandes, not to mention attempts to sign Antoine Semenyo.",
      "We asked for questions and you delivered. The responses to those submitted are below. We will be running weekly question and answer sessions from now, so keep an eye on our social media feeds and get your questions in as we seek to keep you plugged in to everything going on at Old Trafford.",
      "Appreciating that we don't want to completely undermine the summer budget, how feasible is it that we could trigger Semenyo's release clause and still look at a loan-with-an-option deal for someone like Conor Gallagher?",
      "From a budget point of view, I think that would be doable. The question is whether they want someone like Conor Gallagher. The noise coming out of United is that they will only move for long-term targets next month, which essentially means bringing forward a deal for someone they had lined up in the summer.",
      "Semenyo ticks that box. They looked at him earlier this year, remained interested and would have waited until next summer but for the fact that his release clause meant there was suddenly a queue for him. I believe his release clause might be smaller in the summer, but nobody can afford to wait now.",
      "I don't see United being able to get the calibre of midfielder they want in the summer on loan this winter. Someone like Gallagher or Ruben Neves might tick a box as a short-term, emergency option, but even Ruben Amorim said on Sunday they were keen to avoid making mistakes and would rather suffer short-term pain than make a transfer mistake.",
      "When will the manager give more of the young players a chance instead of buying expensive flops?",
      "To be fair to Amorim, he has given young players a go. As he pointed out, Toby Collyer, Harry Amass and Chido Obi got chances last season. I don't think any of them could say they have been harshly treated.",
      "Collyer has had injury issues since, and Amass is doing well at a struggling Sheffield Wednesday. He will come on for the experience but I don't think anyone thinks he's ready for first-team football at Old Trafford. Chido struggled to influence first-team games last term and isn't exactly knocking the door down now.",
      "There are question marks over how many players at academy level are ready to step up and I don't think Amorim is alone in having doubts. United have made costly mistakes in the market in recent years, but under Amorim, their record looks to have improved.",
      "Senne Lammens looks like a solid signing and Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha look like very good deals. Benjamin Sesko has had a slow start, but there have been flashes of quality.",
      "Fans always want to see young players, especially when a team is struggling, but I don't think the answer lies in youth at the moment.",
      "When was the last time United made a profit from selling a player they had bought? They always seem to take heavy losses when selling \" flops\".",
      "I think the clue is in the question. If you are selling a flop, you aren't going to make a profit on him. It goes without saying that a player's value will have shrunk if they have been a disappointment since signing.",
      "I often think the discourse around United's ability to sell players is a little overplayed. They could certainly get better at it, but Manchester United aren't a selling club. There are usually only two reasons for United to sell, A) that player isn't good enough for the club, or B) they want to move elsewhere (such as Cristiano Ronaldo).",
      "It isn't always that clear-cut, of course, but let's look at a couple of recent departures. Antony and Aaron Wan-Bissaka were poor signings who were never likely to live up to their price tag. That is a failure of recruitment rather than selling.",
      "Aside from academy graduates, one of the last players United made a profit on was Daniel James, but that was always a weird deal. He was never likely to make the grade, improved a little and was 'flipped' for a profit. That is what you expect of Brighton or Brentford, not Manchester United.",
      "Manchester United should not go for a defensive midfielder in this January transfer window. But if we can get the Antoine Semenyo deal done, then it will be considered a good window.",
      "I think if United finish this window with just Semenyo, then it will be a good month. There is fierce competition for his signature but he would follow the trend of Cunha and Mbeumo as Premier League-proven players ready to 'plug and play' under Amorim, even if he ends up playing left wing-back.",
      "There is a concern at the lack of options in midfield and it feels like all four midfielders have question marks over their futures beyond the summer, but United are determined not to panic. They are planning a midfield rebuild in 2026 and it might have to wait until the summer, when we can expect similar sums to the £200m+ spent on forwards in 2025 to be splashed on midfielders.",
      "Did United receive any compensation from the FA for Luke Shaw being injured for months after ridiculously playing for England at the Euros?",
      "FIFA's Club Protection Programme covers the salary of anyone injured on international duty. They must be out for a period of at least 28 consecutive days and the scheme is capped at €7.5million.",
      "However, Luke Shaw was not injured on international duty in 2024. You could argue he rushed back to play for England, having missed the last three months of the season for United, but which professional footballer wouldn't want to play in a major tournament final for their country?",
      "It's worth remembering that Shaw played the full 90 minutes in England's Euro 2024 final against Spain. He played 42 minutes against Switzerland in the quarter-finals and 45 minutes against the Netherlands in the semi-final. He returned to pre-season training at Carrington on time.",
      "It was while wearing United training kit that he picked up another injury. Maybe that was due to the efforts made to get fit for England, but we can't be sure. What we can say is that those problems look to be a thing of the past and his fitness record this season has been exceptional.",

      "How do you solve a problem like Bruno? In a week when Manchester United had to consider the possibility of losing their best player after his unexpected comments about his future, they are about to get a taste of what life without Fernandes might actually be like.",
      "The 31-year-old reckons United's powerbrokers wanted to sell him last summer but lacked the \"courage\" to go through with it. His performances this season have once again made him indispensable, but after picking up a hamstring injury at Aston Villa, he now faces a spell on the sidelines.",
      "What are the patterns they can take from those four defeats? These are the games and what sticks out from a Fernandes-less United.",
      "Fernandes wasn't really missing back in May. He was at the Gtech Community Stadium, but spent the whole game sat on the bench. It summed up how United's focus had turned away from the Premier League and towards the Europa League.",
      "Amorim's selection shows how priorities had changed and maybe this game belongs in a category of its own. There were starts for Tyler Fredricson, Harry Amass and Chido Obi. United added gloss to the scoreline but were 4-1 down with eight minutes to go. Mason Mount, Alejandro Garnacho and Amad got the goals and only one of that trio will be available on Boxing Day.",
      "With Fernandes absent, it was Kobbie Mainoo who played next to Manuel Ugarte, another option that is off the table against Newcastle. Amad came on at half-time and he and Garnacho provided some spark to the attack, but that won't be possible now.",
      "Maybe the most relevant game of them all, given Newcastle will be the first opponents United confront without Fernandes. The captain was suspended after being sent off against Wolves, and this was a grim day nobody wants to remember.",
      "Newcastle were 2-0 up inside 20 minutes and it felt like they declared after that. Joshua Zirkzee was hooked after 33 minutes and booed off. Casemiro was given such a run around that it felt like it might be the end for him at Old Trafford.",
      "United mustered just one shot on target as they lost for the fourth game in a row. \"It is a really difficult moment, one of the more difficult moments in the history of Manchester United and we have to address it with honesty,\" Amorim said after the game.",
      "On this occasion, it was Casemiro and Christian Eriksen in midfield, but the ageing duo were run ragged by Sandro Tonali, Joelinton and Bruno Guimaraes. That trio will be licking their lips at the chance to inflict more damage on the United midfield.",
      "The second of two successive games that Fernandes missed with a knee injury. This time, United managed two shots on target and were comfortably held at bay by an Arsenal side still pushing for the title.",
      "United went into the game with a midfield trio of Sofyan Amrabat, Mainoo and Scott McTominay, while Erik ten Hag finally handed a chance to Amad. That is at least something to emerge from the wreckage of the defeats without Fernandes.",
      "There was a lack of creativity on show and with injuries forcing Ten Hag to field Jonny Evans and Casemiro together in the centre of defence, United did well to keep the score down to one.",
      "That was a marked improvement from what happened at Selhurst Park six days earlier. This was a defeat that should have sounded the death knell for the Ten Hag era.",
      "United were ripped to shreds in South London, when Palace had four goals by the 66th minute and could have easily had more. It remains one of the worst nights in the post-Sir Alex Ferguson era, which is saying something.",
      "Palace racked up 10 shots on target to a pitiful two for United, who played with no intensity or imagination. A midfield of Mainoo, Eriksen and Mount might look good on paper, but they were trampled all over.",
      "Ten Hag insisted after the game that \"I will keep fighting\" and somehow United beat Manchester City in the FA Cup final a few weeks later. Thankfully, Fernandes was fit for that one.",
      "Four games without Fernandes and four defeats. Three of them without scoring, and two of them scoring highly on the embarrassment scale. It doesn't bode well.",
      "United managed 10 shots on target in those four games, but half of those were in the chaotic game at Brentford, which had a significant end-of-season vibe.",
      "Across those four games, United created an expected goals (xG) tally of 3.2, of which around half came at Brentford. Fernandes might be playing a deeper role, but he is still miles clear when it comes to creating chances and in his absence, it's pretty clear that there will be fewer opportunities, which is going to put a premium on taking them.",

      "If Manchester United need an example of a January transfer deal that turned out to be a success, then they only need to look at the captain they are now dreading being without for a week. Bruno Fernandes arrived in January 2020 and is the best signing the club have made in any transfer window for a long, long time.",
      "Those sorts of success stories can be few and far between, but the secret to success in the mid-season market is not to get blown off course. The deals that turn out to be good ones are usually a case of a club fulfilling a long-standing interest in a player, rather than rushing into short-term or panicked deals.",
      "Far too often, United's recent January business has tended towards the latter. The jury is open on last season's mid-season window dealings. Ayden Heaven had a good start to his United career but still has plenty to learn and after a shaky spell, Patrick Dorgu was much improved when returning to the team against Aston Villa on Sunday.",
      "Maybe, in time, those will look like January steals, although United were shopping in the sales a year ago, so tight was their precarious financial situation. The purse strings are a little looser now and a £65million deal for Antoine Semenyo would fit the Fernandes mould. He is a player they have long admired and are making a move now because he is set to leave Bournemouth next month.",
      "But that was not the case when loan moves were made for Wout Weghorst and Marcel Sabitzer in the winter of 2023, or Odion Ighalo in 2020. They might have been loans, but they don't come without a cost and all of them speak to poor squad planning.",
      "Amorim was asked about January plans at Villa Park, in the wake of seeing his captain go off injured, an extremely rare sight in the career of Fernandes, who has missed two games in nearly six years at Old Trafford. His answer might have disappointed fans desperate for a raft of activity next month, but it was sensible and reassuring for those keen to see a new outlook on recruitment.",
      "\"What we cannot do is to reach January and try to do everything in urgency and make mistakes,\" he said. \"And then here we go again with a lot of mistakes. I'm not going to get with Jason [Wilcox] and Omar [Berrada] and I'm going to say we need a lot of players because we have a plan.",
      "\"If we have to suffer, the club comes first. Of course, we are in the moment that we need points, but we need to find solutions and we are going to continue with our plan. Of course, you can feel that in this moment we are going to struggle, but we'll see.\"",
      "We've seen plans change before, but it certainly sounds like Amorim is determined not to go down the short-term fix route. His reference to the mistakes of the past is accurate and those deals have got United nowhere. Loan moves in the middle of the season are unlikely to significantly enhance the quality of this squad.",
      "Amorim would rather face short-term pain, whether that be turning to the academy or getting creative with his squad, such as fielding Lisandro Martinez in midfield. The risk is that it compromises the ambition of qualifying for the Champions League, but then who could add enough quality to strengthen that aim next month, without breaking the bank?",
      "Maybe United will suffer for a little while. Amorim is banking that in the long run, focusing finances on targets that really will add quality will pay off. It sounds like a sensible strategy.",

      "Sunday, December 21, 2025, will forever be a special day for Jack Fletcher and Shea Lacey, regardless of Manchester United's defeat at Aston Villa. The 18-year-olds will never forget their professional debuts, especially coming for United on a big Premier League stage.",
      "It's an interesting time for two academy graduates to be adding their names to a historic list of youngsters making the step up to the first team as well. Ruben Amorim threw them both on at Villa Park with resources stretched to breaking point, and he did so having been critical of the academy in recent weeks.",
      "The relationship between Amorim and those nurturing the stars of the future could be strained after recent comments, with the head coach not always giving the impression he was happy with the quality or the attitude of those being developed.",
      "However, in the West Midlands, he demonstrated that he was still willing to turn to them when needed. Fletcher came on with 17 minutes remaining and Lacey got the final six minutes, having been an unused substitute on four occasions recently. Both can be happy with their brief cameos.",
      "There could be more opportunities to come. Casemiro will return on Boxing Day, but United will be without seven first-team players, with Noussair Mazraoui, Harry Maguire, Matthijs de Ligt, Amad, Kobbie Mainoo, Bruno Fernandes and Bryan Mbeumo all set to be out. That could hand more squad places to academy kids.",
      "As good as Fletcher and Lacey might be feeling this morning, however, they have been warned that making their debuts is far from the end of the road and after Amorim's recent comments, they will know hard times could be ahead as well. Even for the best players, the path is very rarely smooth.",
      "That is the point Amorim made a week ago when he cited the debuts handed out to Harry Amass and Chido Obi last season, who played for United at the ages of 18 and 17, but now find themselves going through different periods. Amass is playing well for a struggling Championship side and Chido is having a more difficult season at academy level.",
      "Both players reacted badly to those comments, posting photos on Instagram of successful moments in recent months, only to then delete them. Amorim was unflinching in his criticism last week, but made the valid point that it can be dangerous to cosset young players and that sometimes they need to go through tougher spells as part of their development.",
      "\"Sometimes strong words is not bad words. Sometimes difficult moments is not a bad thing for the kids,\" he said. \"We don’t need to be always with accolades in everything, in every situation. We are not helping.\"",
      "Those are words that Fletcher and Lacey should remember. A month from now, the injured players are likely to return, and the Africa Cup of Nations trio of Mazraoui, Amad, and Mbeumo will be back. With a fully fit squad to pick from, Amorim won't be calling on Fletcher or Lacey.",
      "They have had a taste of first-team football for one of the world's biggest clubs, but very soon they will be playing academy football again or having a loan spell in the EFL. When that happens, they should take Amorim's comments on board. They have enjoyed a memorable day in their young careers, but the hard work has barely even begun.",

      "Manchester United boss Ruben Amorim defended Leny Yoro, Ayden Heaven and Benjamin Sesko after the team's 2-1 defeat to Aston Villa. United left Birmingham empty-handed on Sunday following two goals from Morgan Rogers.",
      "Yoro gave Rogers yards of space for the opening goal of the game, and he was at the scene of the crime again when the in-form England international fired his side back into the lead. Heaven was tested against the experienced Ollie Watkins, while Sesko missed two chances in quick succession in the first half on his first start since recovering from a knee injury.",
      "Discussing Sesko in his post-match press conference, Amorim said: \"He is returning to competition, really fast, he is going to improve a lot, the idea was 70-75 [minutes], he stopped for a while, we are trying to help the players.\"",
      "When discussing whether United conceded similar goals at Villa Park, Amorim defended Yoro and Heaven, saying: \"Sometimes we can suffer goals and concede. When you want to press and they kick the ball, Rogers can go both sides, it is really hard to defend a player like that one against one.",
      "\"We had some games against Nottingham Forest, Ayden [Heaven] and Leny [Yoro] defend one against one most of the time, Luke Shaw is the same. It is not just if you suffer goals, but the way. Sometimes the details can change the narrative.\"",
      "United had the opportunity to move up to fifth in the table with a victory against Villa, but they will head into the Boxing Day game against Newcastle sitting in seventh position in the league.",
      "Amorim will be without Bruno Fernandes, who picked up a muscle injury in the first half of the game. \"I think it's soft tissue so it's going to be a while. We'll see,\" the United boss said.",
      "When asked whether Kobbie Mainoo could return to face Newcastle, he added: \"Kobbie Mainoo is out, Bruno is out, so we'll see. No excuses, we'll try to win the next game.\"",

      "Senne Lammens wore a polo shirt and a navy sweatshirt when he visited Old Trafford after signing for Manchester United. The young goalkeeper looked as though he could be joining United to work in their HR department.",
      "The same observation was made when Lammens reported for international duty with Belgium last week - the 23-year-old was dressed in a beige collared jacket, a khaki t-shirt and chinos.",
      "\"By accident, I saw an article saying he was wearing something boring when he reported for international duty and fans saying they hoped he stays like this,\" laughed Hayk Milkon, one of Lammens' former coaches.",
      "\"This 'boringness' is just the way Senne is, he's really calm and no excesses. He focuses on what he needs to focus on and is open with the people around him. He keeps his feet on the ground.\"",
      "If Lammens looks like someone who could work in an office, every workplace would love to have him in their five-a-side team. United believe they have signed a young goalkeeper with huge potential, and fans who were present at Old Trafford against Sunderland left the stadium buzzing about his debut.",
      "The quirk is that Lammens appears to be a different person when he wears his goalkeeper kit. He made a supremely confident United debut, aggressively commanded his area and kept a clean sheet.",
      "Milkon coached Lammens during their time together at Club Brugge. Milkon is now the youngest manager in the Belgian top-flight and Lammens plays for the biggest club in England.",
      "\"It was Senne with his headphones on. He would go into the gym to do his recovery or some extra top-ups. Or he would just go to relax by playing basketball - he loved to play basketball.\"",
      "Milkon coached in different roles at Club Brugge. He was the assistant of Club NXT (their reserve team), served as their interim manager, was in charge of the Under-18s and eventually became a first-team coach.",
      "His time at Club Brugge coincided with Lammens progressing from the academy to their first team, so he is uniquely positioned to provide insight into United's new goalkeeper signing.",
      "Lammens joined Club Brugge's academy when he was 12. \"He was a guy with huge potential,\" said Milkon. \"As I learned from colleagues who had worked with him when he was much younger, I heard there was a moment that clicked in his head when he became super professional.",
      "\"He was one of the guys during Covid - when the players were not able to train - who was doing a lot at home, he was really going far with this to be the best in these types of areas.",
      "\"Then he continued like this when he joined the first team to train with them. He always wanted to improve. We also had something in place to look at the parameters on which goalkeepers are judged.",
      "\"You see the potential of the goalkeeper based on what they do in games; so their positioning, their decision-making and so on, and Senne was always quite high in these areas.",
      "\"The only bad luck that he had was that the first-team goalkeeper was Simon Mignolet. He's an amazing goalkeeper, so it was difficult for Senne to stay over there in the role of No.2.",
      "\"That would have also blocked his growth, so it was good for him in the end to make the step to go to Antwerp and he did a tremendous job there. It was amazing to see how fast he adapted.\"",
      "Milkon continued: \"I think for us at Club Brugge, it was very clear to everyone that Senne was a top goalkeeper. He would have been the perfect fit for Club Brugge to be the No.1.",
      "\"That was not possible because Mignolet was there. But the parameters that we used to judge his performances indicated he was ticking so many boxes already, and he was consistently doing it.",
      "\"There weren't ups and downs with his performances. He was consistently really high and when you compare this to the top goalkeepers, you have a benchmark to say 'Ok, what potential does this guy have?'",
      "\"He had some chances with the first team at Club Brugge and made a mistake, or maybe two, but in the end it was very clear to everyone that he was a top goalkeeper.",
      "\"It was impossible to try to extend his contract because, again, you have Mignolet, and you cannot block a guy like this. You know he has to go out, he has to play, and he will improve even more.\"",
      "When asked about Lammens' strengths, he said: \"I would say that his decision-making was very good. He is very calm, he sees the solutions on the pitch, he has a quick reaction time and understands the balance between risk and reward, and which decisions are the right ones to make.",
      "\"His clean passing is great, his footwork was really good, and he's just an amazing goalkeeper with the shot-stopping. He made some incredible saves back then already. He's quite a complete goalkeeper.",
      "\"But making the right decisions at a very young age, being very mature with this, was really impressive. And the fact that he is good with both feet is another big strength.",
      "\"For me, Senne is a very calm guy and has all the qualities to be a top professional. That was my impression when I first met him when he was younger and he never changed.\"",
      "Lammens joined Royal Antwerp on a free transfer in the summer of 2023. He was handed his debut a few months later and served as an understudy that season, but earned first-choice status for 2024/2025.",
      "His performances drew attention from the Belgian media. Lammens saved four penalties across a successful first full campaign and received a call-up to Belgium's senior squad in March.",
      "Milkon said: \"I was not surprised when I saw Manchester United had come calling. And to record his first clean sheet, I was really happy for him. Senne is a potential No.1 for the Red Devils - the Belgium national team.",
      "\"He got his chance, he took it, and we're all really proud of him, but we knew it would happen. I believe he has all the capabilities to become the best in the world, so I wish him all the best. I'm sure he will have a very good career in England, and Manchester United should return to the big club they used to be.",
      "\"He will have a positive impact on that, for sure, and hopefully he will be Belgium's first-choice goalkeeper soon. I believe he has the potential, the skillset and the personality to do that.",
      "\"For me, it was just having a tiny little part in having an influence on him at Brugge, but it was the most positive memories of our relationship that we had during this spell.",
      "\"I'm very proud that he is reaching these high levels and not surprised. I believe he will be successful because he is a guy who will not change his focus or start to do something different. He is calm, that's his personality and character, and he wants to succeed. He is hungry and will keep working to be his best.",
      "\"He is so calm, and you have to be patient in football. You cannot worry too much and want things too early, but finding the balance between not being impatient and, at the same time, pushing and demanding what you deserve in a good way, means everything will sort itself out.\"",
      "United staff who have worked with Lammens at Carrington have echoed Milkon's sentiments. He has been described as \"really mature for his age\" and is said to have taken the move in his stride.",
      "Lammens is understood to have impressed coaches during training sessions and a United source said that lots of people have been speaking positively about him. He has already relocated from the luxury hotel where he was initially staying and into a house.",
      "It's no surprise that Lammens likes to play basketball at 6ft 3in, but he is a keen golfer, which is common ground with the likes of Tom Heaton, Luke Shaw, Mason Mount and Harry Maguire.",
      "Matthijs de Ligt, Amad, Maguire and Shaw jogged straight to Lammens to congratulate him after full-time against Sunderland. \"Are you Schmeichel in disguise?\" was chanted at Lammens from the Stretford End.",
      "It remains to be seen whether Lammens will start against Liverpool on Sunday, but it would be a surprise to see him on the bench after delivering a strong debut before the international break.",
      "There would be nothing boring about keeping another clean sheet - this time at Anfield.",
      "Kitbag has slashed the price of Man United kits and merch with up to 50% off select items.",

      "Casemiro made a beeline for Ruud van Nistelrooy in the Old Trafford tunnel on his return with Leicester City in February.",
      "Van Nistelrooy, a fluent Spanish speaker, was the conduit between Casemiro and Erik ten Hag after his Portuguese-speaking assistant Mitchell van der Gaag left. Van Nistelrooy started Casemiro in all four of his matches as caretaker manager. Casemiro lingered as Van Nistelrooy spoke, as attached to him as a comfort blanket.",
      "At that time, Casemiro had not started for United in 39 days. He did not get a kick between December 30, the night of the Newcastle United debacle, and January 30. He emerged on 70 minutes in Bucharest with United 2-0 up. The transfer window was still open but the chances of United shifting Casemiro were, like the Trinity test igniting the atmosphere, near zero.",
      "People at United's Carrington training complex noticed Casemiro's personality never wavered during a trying first half of the season. They have always found him to be a warm presence.",
      "His transformation at United in the past two months has been as unexpected as their 3-0 triumph in Bilbao. This is the midfielder who was dropped for last year's FA Cup final and replaced by Toby Collyer with United 2-0 down to Liverpool at half-time eight months ago. Casemiro’s declaration that he was keen to see out his contract in March was framed as more bad news for the club.",
      "Casemiro used his head before Athletic lost theirs in San Mames. Returning to Spain emboldens Casemiro. In San Sebastián and Bilbao, he has reminded Spanish audiences he can still cut it nearly three years on from leaving their shores. United supporters serenaded Casemiro on Thursday night.",
      "The draw with Real Sociedad in mid-March has marked a late turning point in Casemiro's third season in Manchester. With Manuel Ugarte out injured, Ruben Amorim had little choice but to turn to the older defensive midfielder.",
      "Casemiro has since been a fixture in the United starting XI, his importance highlighted by the early withdrawal at Bournemouth last week to preserve him for Bilbao. Ugarte admitted this week he is copying him.",
      "Within a matter of months, Casemiro has gone from unsellable to undroppable. If or when United reach the Europa League final, Casemiro is a shoo-in in midfield. The 3-4-2-1 system Amorim swears by has closed the yawning gaps that developed between the defence and midfield under Ten Hag and Casemiro has the safety net of a third centre back.",
      "United have adjusted Casemiro’s running and pressing triggers. “I think he has improved a lot also,” Amorim opined. “You can see not the way he plays but the way he runs. You can see it, we have the data to show him where he worked really hard.",
      "“He is a very good example. Even Toby sometimes was playing in front of him and [that] it is hard to take for Casemiro. So it is a lesson for all the players in Manchester United.",
      "“No matter what is the past or the last month, everything can change in one moment. Then we understood that he cannot jump all the time pressing high. We need to let him understand and sometimes it is better to put three defenders and let him be the fourth defender and put the wing-backs pressing high. These are all things we are understanding and trying to cope with all the criticisms of the team. But the credit is for Casemiro.”",
      "Amorim has been impressed by how hard Casemiro has worked to meet his demands to regain his place in the team. He noticed that he never complained during those winter weeks warming the bench.",
      "Selflessness is a natural trait of Casemiro's. It was also his undoing this time last year. With United depleted at centre half, he dropped back and was humiliated in the 4-0 drubbing by Crystal Palace.",
      "With Kobbie Mainoo and Christian Eriksen a flimsy shield and Jonny Evans his creaking partner, Casemiro abandoned his position to engage Michael Olise, overcommitted, lost his balance and Olise scored. Six days later, he trundled out of the United third and played Arsenal winger Gabriel Martinelli onside to square for Leandro Trossard’s tap-in. Sofyan Amrabat was ushered back in from the cold and played his way into the FA Cup final XI.",
      "Jamie Carragher urged Casemiro to “leave the football before the football leaves you”. Casemiro had been pencilled in to flank Amorim for pre-match press duties against Athletic and he would be a worthy choice at Carrington next week. He is a positive story again and one of the squad’s figureheads. United view Casemiro as a quiet leader, mind.",
      "The 33-year-old shared Raphael Varane’s view that a “disconnect” had developed between the players and Ten Hag. It is not a coincidence that Casemiro scored two goals in the first game after Ten Hag was finally sacked. He was committed enough to claim the last goal of the Ten Hag era at West Ham.",
      "When Casemiro discussed the possibility of joining United, he wanted to know three things: where he would live, where he would train and where the stadium was. During FaceTime conversations, he requested to see the club’s gymnasium at Carrington.",
      "United sources have been struck by how leaner Casemiro is this season. People in Madrid said Casemiro used to be in the club's Valdebebas gym at 8am and he often has gym sessions before and after training at Carrington.",
      "Casemiro has struck up a close rapport with some of the masseurs and his English is now a very good level of conversational. He understood our questions in the mixed zone two years ago, when his handshake grip was as tight as a vice. Casemiro's wife, Anna, and children Sara and Caio, are happy in Manchester amid the prospect of a fourth year in England's north west.",
      "Staff at Carrington regard Casemiro as one of the most respectful players they have encountered and that he is strident in protecting the club's image. Sir Jim Ratcliffe dubbed Casemiro as \"overpaid\" and \"not good enough\" in March. Three days later, Casemiro trumped his first-leg performance against Sociedad in the 4-1 win at Old Trafford.",
      "His steep decline over 18 months - dropped for Amrabat, substituted for Collyer, omitted from the Brazil squad - makes Casemiro’s revival so singular. If United win the Europa League it would be churlish to argue someone who has won three trophies in three seasons has been an unsuccessful signing.",
      "Casemiro drove United to a successful 2022-23 season. Without him, they would not have qualified for the Champions League. Ten Hag dubbed him the “cement between the stones”, essentially the glue in the team. Casemiro was central to the Latino rebranding of the United defence that kept the most clean sheets in the Premier League.",
      "Casemiro has returned to that level of influence he wielded in his first season. In Europe, at least. The concern if United do not triumph in Bilbao again this month is Casemiro could be redundant in a campaign devoid of Champions League midweeks.

      "Fabrizio Romano has revealed there has been contact between Manchester United and Ruben Neves, as he revealed the chances of a move for the midfielder.",
      "That United want to improve their midfield is evident. One of their favoured options, Casemiro, is due to exit in the summer, while his usual partner, Bruno Fernandes, is currently injured, and Manuel Ugarte and Kobbie Mainoo are not often given a lot of minutes.",
      "Big names such as Adam Wharton, Elliot Anderson and Carlos Baleba are all on United’s radar but will prove too expensive in January.",
      "A move for former Wolves man Neves, then, could have been ideal, as he’s out of contract with Al-Hilal in the summer, when he’d be free, or they could sell him on the cheap before that.",
      "Speaking on YouTube, transfer insider Romano has confirmed contact for Neves, but nothing so serious that it will lead to a transfer.",
      "He said: “I wanted to clarify a couple of things, the first one about Ruben Neves, as I saw many of you asking me about what I said the other day here on the channel.",
      "“Let me be clear, I didn’t post anything on Ruben Neves on my social media, because there is no news on Ruben Neves in terms of negotiations, in terms of bids, in terms of talks.",
      "“What Manchester United did is to be in touch with the agent who also represents Ruben Neves. “But Man United didn’t start a real negotiation with Ruben Neves, with Al-Hilal to sign the player.",
      "“So at this stage, nothing is moving. They spoke about several players, not just Ruben Neves, several opportunities, something like ideas, opportunities, talents.",
      "“Ruben Neves is represented by one of the most powerful agents in football. So that’s something absolutely normal, but nothing has really changed so far.”",
      "It comes after a report stated that United and Newcastle were both preparing offers for Neves.",
      "That came amid suggestions that Neves wanted to leave Saudi Arabia, with United looking a suitable destination for him.",
      "He will get the opportunity to leave in the summer, but whether the Red Devils still want him by then remains to be seen, as it’s felt they’ll have a better chance at landing one of the star Premier League midfielders by then.",
      "According to reports, Al Hilal midfielder Ruben Neves wants to leave Saudi Arabia and has interest from Manchester United, Newcastle and Spurs.",
      "According to reports, Manchester United are ‘ready to act’ under the right circumstances in January and could make a bargain signing.",
      "Man Utd were reportedly the frontrunners to sign Al-Hilal midfielder Ruben Neves in the January transfer window until Real Madrid joined the race.",
      "According to reports, Manchester United have decided that they will ‘go all out’ for Liverpool and Manchester City target Antoine Semenyo in January.",

      "But of late, City have pushed their way to the top of the pile for him. Fabrizio Romano revealed things were trending very much in the right direction for the transfer just before Christmas, and that seems to remain the case.",
      "Liverpool are reportedly still alive in the race, though it’s felt Semenyo would rather head to City.",
      "According to Merson, a different club entirely, Tottenham, could be where the winger lands.",

That might be one of the reasons.",
      "“Man City? We don’t know if Pep is going to be there next season. So for me, I think Tottenham.",
      "“It’s really open, need a left-sided midfielder, there’s plenty of space and he’ll play every week. He plays every week at Bournemouth. Will he get used to being able to play two games, coming out for one or two, playing another two.",

      "“He might be one of them players that needs to play week in, week out. It’s hard. The foreign players can do it, they’ve been used to it. But for English players, and especially for someone like him who has been playing consistently all the time, he might not like that.",
      "“So, it’s one for him to think about. He’s got the world at his feet, and all he’s got to do is make sure, thank God, he doesn’t get injured in the next 12 days or so.”",

      "According to recent reports, including from Italian journalist Francesca Teodori, the signing of Kone at United is essentially a certainty.",

      "This term, the additions of Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko have helped to increase the goals output, which is now the third best in the league.",
      "Mbeumo is currently away at AFCON, where assisted in Cameroon’s tournament opener – a 1-0 victory over Cameroon.",

      "The forward started AFCON well, scoring Mali’s opening goal of the tournament in a 1-1 draw with Zambia, before also bagging a goal against Morocco in the next game.",
      "That follows on from some good club form this season, with the 26-year-old, who has largely played as a striker this term, having scored six goals and assisted two more for Auxerre this term.",
      "In his last three games prior to heading to AFCON, Sinayoko scored three goals and assisted once.",
      "It will be ideal for United, should the Malian join, that he can play anywhere across the front line, as he’s featured on both flanks as well as up top this term.",
      "As a result, should the form of Cunha and Mbeumo drop, he’d be an option in their positions, but could chiefly rival Sesko in the centre of the attack."

      "– The Man Utd medical staff, for failing to overrule Amorim and protect Dorgu from long-term consequences?",

I suspect that only the shot to the face had any actual effect on him and the rest of the injuries were feigned. (And has Amorim encouraged him to cheat?)",
      "If a player goes down holding his head that many times, it’s clear that he’s either cheating or in danger. In neither case should they remain on the pitch. And if players and coaches continue to fake head injuries, a likely consequence is that the protections in place will become less effective.",
      "I think that when play stops for a possible head injury, the player should leave the pitch for an actual neuro exam by an actual physician.

Four wins in five games have a distinctly winnable Europa League campaign bubbling along nicely, too. An astonishing shift from what felt like an inexorable downward spiral not that long ago.",

West Ham were wonderfully welcoming hosts on Sunday, but to such an inexplicable extent that it’s hard to know just how much to read into Liverpool’s 2-0 win at the London Stadium against opponents who were barely there. Predictably, they were poor in a 1-1 against proper team Sunderland and showed no backbone in the collapse at Leeds United, which was then followed by a distinctly unwelcome MO SALAH BOMBSHELL that does leave things looking distinctly like either he or the manager will have to go.",

      "One of the key early-season imponderables for 25/26 was just how big and what kind of impact the Club World Cup might have on the way Chelsea and Man City start the season. Would they hit the ground running, or would they be a bit tired and out of sorts? For both, it’s been a little from column A, a little from column B.",
      "Maresca definitely still has some hearts and minds to win at Chelsea despite the fine finish to the season that saw them tick off Champions League qualification while completing their collection of UEFA pots and pans and then winning the actual Club World Cup.",
      "A home draw with Crystal Palace wasn’t ideal, but the paddling dished out to West Ham has what really should at least be some kind of halfway credible title bid up and running at least. And we strongly suspect Fulham won’t be the last team left scratching their head after losing to Maresca.",
      "There was some talk of ‘Maresca out’ after a draw with Brentford but that was surely only a minority view. After losing to Manchester United in shambolic fashion, there were more on the bandwagon.",
      "That win over Liverpool was big, though, and a particularly good one for Maresca himself. The second half thumping of Forest was handy, too, albeit inevitably saying far more of their opponents than it did of Chelsea. Home defeat to Sunderland saw awkward questions resurfacing, but three wins from three before going toe-to-toe against champions elect Arsenal despite playing most of the game down to 10 men appeared to have rubber-stamped Chelsea’s bona fides.",
      "And then they lost to Leeds United. Which was largely Maresca’s fault. And then continued their self-fulfilling 2024-redux tumble out of the title race with a draw against Bournemouth. Sigh.",
      "Then even a welcome victory has put Maresca under even more pressure after he decided to be very, very weird about everything immediately afterwards.",
      "And while Chelsea aren’t the first team to see apparent control of a game against Villa turn into a painful, perplexing defeat, they are perhaps the most profound example. And it was another that raised serious questions about the players and manager.",

      "A 4-1 thumping of Everton followed a simply huge and wildly unexpected win over Manchester City. Had Newcastle lost that, as all pre-interlull indications suggested they would, then the spotlight would have been harsh indeed on Howe and his team. They would at that point find themselves slap bang in the muck of a relegation scrap; instead they have lifted themselves back into the mid-table morass where – luckily for them – absolutely nobody is any good at all and the chance of re-establishing themselves in there and even emerging out the top was very real indeed.",
      "But instead, they haven’t kicked on at all. A home win over Burnley is their only success in five subsequent games, all of which were winnable. It’s emblematic of a season stubbornly refusing to get going and could yet prove costly for Howe.",
      "",
      "So doomed now they might as well stick with Edwards for a bit. He’s only just got here. And narrow defeats at Arsenal and Liverpool have at least showed a bit of something.",
      "",
      "The hard-nosed yet valid argument persists that Leeds could and perhaps should have taken drastic action in the summer even after their very good week. It would have made Spurs’ decision to sack Europa League-winning Ange Postecoglou look positively kind, Leeds – and Burnley for that matter – might now be better off had they thanked the managers who secured 100 Championship points and got them back into the big time and then sent them on their way.",
      "Farke had a dreadful Premier League record of only six wins and 26 points from his 49 games in charge of Norwich, a team he twice led to promotion from the Championship with 94 and 97 points.",
      "As well as fighting his own record in this competition, Farke faced the added burden of expectation levels very different to those at just about any other club that could possibly find itself promoted into the Premier League in this current era where that represents the most bittersweet of successes.",
      "Defeat at Burnley was honking, but bouncing back to win another six-pointer against West Ham eased the stress significantly before a paddling at Brighton and events elsewhere – including West Ham themselves – left Farke desperately short of immediate cover before a desperately poor show in a six-pointer at Nottingham Forest.",
      "Another painful defeat having gone in front, against Villa this time, saw Leeds drop into the bottom three ahead of a brutal run of games, but that run has gone surprisingly well. The narrow loss to Man City preceded a rare home win against Chelsea and comeback draw against Liverpool.",
      "The question now is whether Leeds and Farke have really hit on something sustainable, or this is merely delaying the inevitable. After the 4-1 win against Crystal Palace, it really does start to look like it might be the latter which has enormous repercussions for both Farke and several other names around him on this list.",
      "",
      "Seven points from three games against Newcastle, Burnley and Bournemouth left things looking far comfier than might have been expected for a manager who, when the Magpies took an early lead at the London Stadium, looked to be heading for a second sack of the season long before the Christmas decorations went up.",
      "But quite why Nuno had to be so very Nuno in the way he, on the back of 3-1 and 3-2 wins and a 2-2 draw, decided to approach a home game against a Liverpool team that had just suffered three consecutive three-goal defeats, is puzzling, irritating and, above all, a reminder that he is here as a firefighter and that the marriage to a fanbase with limited patience for drab and functional let’s-not-get-relegated football is merely one of convenience.",
      "Especially as we still await truly compelling evidence that this football won’t, in fact, get them relegated. They are still in the bottom three and the increasing signs of life at Nottingham Forest, Leeds and others have to be a concern.",
      "Are there three worse teams than West Ham in the Premier League this season? It’s an extremely fair question with an increasingly troubling conclusion for those of a Hammers persuasion.",
      "",
      "Decision time for Burnley. There are two options available, and they prompt inevitable questions.",
      "Option one: Burnley decide to really try and beat relegation, and must decide whether they think Parker is the best man for that job.",
      "Option two: Burnley accept their overwhelmingly likely fate, and must decide whether Parker the best man to get them back up again.",
      "Parker’s job prospects likely rest on the decision. Because if it is indeed option two, he has a compelling case. Option one? He’s f*cked.",
      "",
      "There have been good days and bad, and our whole pondering of Frank’s situation at Spurs has been about determining which of the two would eventually win out. The harrowing NLD-PSG-Fulham week was the first time he really did look f*cked.",
      "Spurs were timid and abysmal in the North London Derby, the second big London derby in a row which Frank had approached more in the manner of a League One manager attempting to avoid a paddling in the FA Cup third round than a legitimate rival facing a familiar foe.",
      "There was some encouragement in a 5-3 Champions League defeat at PSG, but even the very fact it’s possible to write the words ‘some encouragement in a 5-3 Champions League defeat’ is in its own way damning.",
      "But at least those two defeats came against what genuinely might be the two best teams in Europe at this time. With all due respect to Fulham and the sterling work of Marco Silva in recent years, they are not one of the two best teams in Europe at this time, and they were still much better than Spurs who torpedoed themselves inside the opening seven minutes to extend their extraordinarily – and in fairness largely pre-Frank – awful home record in the Premier League to three wins in 21 games since an increasingly odd-looking 4-1 win over Aston Villa in November last year.",
      "Frank’s response to the booing of Guglielmo Vicario after his hideous blunder was firmly in the ‘That’s true, but he shouldn’t say it’ category. And the way he went about it was all wrong.",
      "There should have been some acknowledgement that the booing of Vicario, unsavoury and unhelpful as it may have been, did not burst forth from a clear blue sky but instead a bubbling frustration from fans who pay among the highest ticket prices in the country to watch what is now among the worst and least effective football in the country.",
      "To instead label those supporters – and the boos did not come from a tiny minority inside the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium – not real Spurs fans was another gaffe that pushes the manager further towards the exit.",
      "Until that point we’d felt the obvious comparisons between Thomas Frank and Nuno Espirito Santo didn’t quite fit.",
      "But it’s certainly starting to look uncomfortably similar in familiar ways; the small-time approach to big games has not been well received and the fear grows that he just doesn’t understand what this job requires. The fact almost no manager in Premier League history has managed to understand what this job requires is cold comfort at this time.",
      "However, from there Spurs went to Newcastle and got a draw (albeit a ludicrous one) before they had a dominant 2-0 win against Frank’s old club Brentford, which everyone at Spurs sorely needed. It was easily their most convincing Premier League performance since the win at City on matchday two and a result that could have been even more compelling.",
      "They then pretty much secured a Champions League play-off round spot at the very least with a fine 3-0 win over Slavia Prague.",
      "But Spurs are Spurs, so they followed that with the worst performance yet of Frank’s reign in a truly inept and miserable 3-0 defeat at Nottingham Forest.",
      "Bringing Joao Palhinha and Ben Davies on to try and hold on to a 2-0 defeat and not even managing that feels uncomfortably like the infamous Nuno Moment against Manchester United.",
      "Have reached the kind of state where a dreadful home defeat to a very poor Liverpool is being dressed up as ‘signs of encouragement’. In reality, it might have been the worst possible result; still a defeat, yet one that risks extending the increasingly obviously doomed reign of the latest manager to be chewed up and spat out by the country’s most preposterous football club.",
      "But with Palace and then another date with his old club Brentford, it’s not hard to picture what might happen next.",

      "Man Utd head coach Ruben Amorim has explained why he substituted Casemiro over other players during their 1-0 win over Newcastle on Boxing Day.",
      "The Red Devils were missing a number of key players with Bruno Fernandes injured, while Bryan Mbeumo, Amad Diallo and Noussair Mazraoui were all missing.",
      "With Man Utd captain Fernandes absent through injury, Casemiro and Manuel Ugarte started as their central midfield pairing with Amorim bringing Leny Yoro on for the Brazilian on 61 minutes.",
      "Casemiro didn’t look too impressed by Amorim’s decision to take him off with the 33-year-old pointing to himself as the substitution board was held up.",
      "And when asked to explain why be brought off Casemiro over other players, Amorim told reporters: “In that moment I did not want to take [Matheus] Cunha because he’s the only guy who can allow us to breathe and I put him in a No.10.",

      "“Jack [Fletcher] was fresh to continue, Manu [Ugarte] was fresher than Casemiro, we took a chance because they were making a lot of corner runs and I feel he was going to struggle in that moment.”",
      "“I’m surprised, I am really surprised. I thought [Joshua] Zirkzee would’ve come on for Ugarte and Jack Fletcher would have gone back one [into midfield].",
      "“That is a surprise, I’m shocked, maybe it’s a back five, I’m not sure what it is, maybe it’s a back six, it looks like it. I thought the shape of the team was actually okay.",
      "“Look, Newcastle were on top anyway, I don’t want to be a pessimist if you’re a Manchester United fan watching, but I’d be surprised if this goes well in the next half hour because they look all at sea now, I’m really not sure about those substitutions.”",
      "On the performance of matchwinner Dorgu, Amorim added: “Because you put him in one position that is more in front. The responsibility is not the same. He had a little more freedom, he can take more risks, and I think it helped Patrick to play better.",
      "“They just need to understand, and Manu [Manuel Ugarte] did a very good game today, they must understand that, sometimes, you can have a good day and the next day can be worse. You have to deal with that and train well and to go forward.”",

      "The Frenchman went to Liverpool after Newcastle United failed to sign him and has registered eight goals in 16 Premier League matches, scoring in six separate matches.",
      "Gyokeres, meanwhile, scored twice (one penalty) against Leeds United, one against Burnley, one against Nottingham Forest, and one (penalty) against Everton. He’s struggling to avoid the flat-track bully allegations and has looked a shadow of the player who banged them in for fun at Sporting.",
      "There is an argument that Mikel Arteta and Gyokeres’ teammates are not utilising their new centre-forward very well. He is making all sorts of runs that are being ignored, and the service to him hasn’t been great as Bukayo Saka, Ebere Eze, and Martin Odegaard all struggle to create.",
      "He is hardly missing sitters every game, and his mere presence up top has been enough to make a positive difference. But most big-money strikers would have done the same.",

      "Just a s**t move for everyone involved, really. It actually looked like the perfect move at the time. Elliott was ready to assume an important role at a decent club, and Villa gave him the platform to do so, only to swiftly decide they have no intention of triggering his buy option.",
      "A return to Liverpool following the termination of Elliott’s loan in January looks on the cards. The Reds could have done with having him around during a testing first half of 2025/26.",

      "He has been linked with every big club in Europe during his time at little ol’ Bournemouth, but his stock is quite low at the moment. The Cherries are winless in eight Premier League games as they continue to be the streakiest of all streaky teams, and that means Iraola isn’t being linked with anyone. But the streaky Cherries will soon be on an 11-match unbeaten run, making the Spaniard the most sought-after manager in Europe again.",
      "Perhaps their poor form offers the perfect time for the club’s hierarchy to sit down with Iraola and offer him a new deal. It could come across as a huge display of faith, and then Bournemouth will benefit financially when Manchester City or someone else pays a hefty compensation fee.",
      "Finances are obviously not the biggest positive of renewing Iraola’s contract. They should be desperate to keep the man who’s led them to 12th and 9th in the Premier League.",
      "",
      "Gambling on Keith Andrews felt like a guaranteed inclusion when he was chosen as Thomas Frank’s replacement, but Brentford’s in-house style has not come back to bite them in the backside. We all tipped them to go down, and while that’s still realistic, the Bees are doing much better than most expected following the departures of head coach Frank, star players Yoane Wissa and Bryan Mbeumo, and club captain Christian Norgaard.",
      "Brentford might’ve enjoyed even more success last season if Kayode was allowed to properly channel his inner Rory Delap, and not unleashing it sooner – or at least more often last season – is their biggest mistake of 2025. Yes, we are struggling a bit.",
      "Brentford are 10th for throw-ins taken this season with 325, but Kayode is top in the player ranking with 191 – that is 58.77% of his side’s throws and the highest in the Premier League for an individual by 33.",

      "If there is a blueprint for avoiding immediate relegation, Sunderland have found it. Clubs have spent big following promotions but nowhere near as savvily as the Black Cats. Their signing of Xhaka has been the biggest factor in their success, and Burnley’s recruitment didn’t include anyone close to Xhaka’s experience and ability. Amazingly, it could’ve made such a significant difference.",

      "We are again questioning why Chelsea still don’t have an elite striker or goalkeeper after spending so much money.",
      "Joao Pedro showed us at the Club World Cup that he is capable of being a world-class No.9, but he’s not really played there this season. Meanwhile, Robert Sanchez has never been so comfortably No.1 at Stamford Bridge. Still, it’s weird that Chelsea were properly stingy with Milan in negotiations for France goalkeeper Mike Maignan.",
      "Maignan is one of the best goalkeepers in the world and was available for around £20million, yet Chelsea didn’t want to pay over £12m. Yes, he is out of contract next summer, but we’re completely baffled that a club so scattergun and trigger-happy in the transfer market were unwilling to pay an extra ~£8m to fix a problem position with a world-class signing.",
      "",
      "Palace are going to lose Oliver Glasner. That is obvious. When? Probably at the end of 2025/26. Where will he go? That’s anyone’s guess.",
      "After guiding the Eagles to their first-ever trophy and subsequently their first-ever European campaign, Glasner wanted more backing in the summer transfer window. He felt massively let down by chairman Steve Parish and let the media know as much, while Parish couldn’t fight his corner as losing the Austrian before 2025/26 started would’ve been an absolute disaster.",
      "It’s felt inevitable that Glasner would take the step up to a bigger club, and a disappointing summer is one of the biggest reasons he won’t renew his contract and walk away in June, if not sooner.",
      "",
      "Everton have lacked a prolific goalscorer for a while. It’s something they desperately needed to address last summer, and they did so by signing a top, young player with bags of potential in Thierno Barry. It’s safe to say it hasn’t worked out for him so far.",
      "Dominic Calvert-Lewin, at his absolute best, scored 16 Premier League goals in 2020/21, the most for the Toffees since Romelu Lukaku backed up an 18-goal campaign with a 25-goal 2016/17.",
      "Everton should probably stick to recruiting strikers from English clubs. Their list of top scorers in each Premier League season goes as follows (centre-forwards only): Calvert-Lewin, Richarlison, Calvert-Lewin, Richarlison, Calvert-Lewin, Richarlison, Wayne Rooney, Lukaku x4, Nikica Jelavic, Tim Cahill, Louis Saha, Cahill, Yakubu, Andy Johnson, James Beattie, Cahill, Rooney, Tomasz Radzinski, Radzinski and Duncan Ferguson, Kevin Campbell x3, Ferguson x2, Paul Rideout, Tony Cottee x2.",
      "Jelavic and Ferguson hadn’t played in England before joining but were signed straight from Scotland. Radzinski is the only non-Brit there playing for his first English club.",
      "The moral of the story is: keep your striker recruitment a little more local, Everton.",
      "",
      "After watching Crystal Palace win their first major trophy, Fulham must’ve felt desperate to experience the same. Their summer transfer business suggests they’re happy where they are – winning sod all but comfortably avoiding relegation every season.",
      "Kevin was an exciting signing, and Samuel Chukwueze has shown promise, but it was a very underwhelming summer window for the Cottagers.",
      "",
      "As the alphabet would have it, Leeds follow Fulham, and the latter’s best decision of 2025 has created the former’s worst.",
      "Leeds were reportedly interested in signing Wilson in the summer transfer window but couldn’t get a deal over the line. Who knew that he would become a bloody revelation at Craven Cottage a couple of months later? We certainly didn’t.",
      "Daniel Farke was actually let down badly in the end after a strong start to the club’s summer business. He needed more in attack. At least Calvert-Lewin is doing well now.",
      "",
      "Choosing Jeremie Frimpong as Trent Alexander-Arnold’s replacement, picking Florian Wirtz over Rayan Cherki, and signing a player who might be the biggest flop of all flops in Premier League floppyville were big gaffes, but it’s hard to argue that they were worse decisions than waiting until deadline day to have a bid accepted for Marc Guehi.",
      "Guehi leaving could have been the straw that broke the camel’s back for Glasner at Palace, and it could have made a huge difference in an awful first half to the season for the Reds.",
      "He would’ve been able to take a struggling Ibrahima Konate out of the firing line and surely played well enough to stay in the team. Had Guehi been playing well next to Virgil van Dijk, the Liverpool captain and the two full-backs would also look a lot more comfortable.",
      "Yes, Liverpool can get Guehi for nothing next summer, but they have desperately needed him this term.",
      "",
      "This isn’t a huge error on City’s side, but a case of hindsight being a wonderful (or gut-wrenchingly frustrating) thing for young Trafford.",
      "An honourable mention is rejecting big money from Tottenham for Savinho. We’re really not sure what either side was thinking there.",
      "",
      "How long have you got with this lot? It’s pretty difficult to pinpoint the worst decision United made in 2025. Sir Jim Ratcliffe has done and said some very odd things. Ruben Amorim might’ve been sacked four or five times. Spending all of their summer budget on attackers might not have been the best move. Not signing a goalkeeper in January was also a bit silly, if not completely forced by a shoestring budget.",
      "We have landed on a specific part of their Europa League final preparation.",
      "Basically, Amorim opted for continuity and confidence by playing his strongest team in the weeks building up to the final. Spurs boss Ange Postecoglou, meanwhile, rested everyone to ensure his players were fit and well-rested for an absolutely monumental game of football.",
      "Ultimately, one decision aged well, earned the club £100m, and qualified them for the Champions League. And the other decision might’ve cost United the £100m windfall and Champions League football, which Amorim swears he didn’t really want anyway.",
      "",
      "In terms of 2025 transfers, the richest club in the Premier League have had a torrid time. The £55m they spent on Elanga surely goes down as their biggest gaffe, though.",
      "He has really struggled. Like really, really struggled. We don’t want to absolutely hammer the poor lad, so we’ll leave it at that.",
      "",
      "Eight games, zero wins, two draws, six defeats, zero clean sheets, seven goals scored, 17 goals conceded, 39 days in charge, sacked 18 minutes after losing his final match.",
      "Need we say any more?",
      "",
      "If we’re poking holes in their summer recruitment, it would be that they signed quite a few African players in an Africa Cup of Nations season.",
      "AFCON will affect the Black Cats more than any other Premier League club with regular starters Bertrand Traore, Noah Sadiki, and Reinildo all representing their countries, while another important player, Habib Diarra, has returned from injury just in time to link up with his Senegal teammates. Morocco’s Chemsdine Talbi and DR Congo’s Arthur Masuaku are also away and have featured plenty this term.",
      "",
      "On paper, Spurs have a pretty good squad. But football isn’t played on paper, and clearly something is missing. Xavi Simons and Mohammed Kudus should’ve brought an X-factor to Thomas Frank’s squad, but they’ve blown very hot and cold in their early months at the club.",
      "‘Hiring Thomas Frank’ is just the tip of the iceberg. It’s maybe harsh on him because he is a good manager who is willing to adapt, but it’s more that he isn’t the right profile for Spurs.",
      "They needed someone with a proper coaching identity, which Frank unfortunately lacks. He is chopping and changing his tactics too often. We honestly don’t know if he’s an attack-minded coach or a defense-minded coach. He does lean more towards the latter, which is fine for Brentford, but not for a ball-dominant team.",
      "Hopefully Frank is given enough time to prove us wrong and does exactly that, but his first six months at Spurs have been concerning.",
      "",
      "Feels like a lifetime ago, doesn’t it? Well, it happened in January 2025. Potter replaced Julen Lopetegui, and despite defeat in his first game, we thought there was already marked improvement and that the Englishman’s long-awaited return to the dugout was going to go just fine.",
      "Alas, he was sacked in September with West Ham 19th in the Premier League. His win rate was an abysmal 24% during his time at the club. West Ham were the worst ever-present Premier League club during his tenure, accumulating 23 points, four fewer than Wolves, who were above Spurs and Man United by two points and one respectively.",
      "Nuno Espirito Santo has slightly steadied the ship, but we’re not fully convinced West Ham won’t sink into the Championship for the first time since 2011/12.",
      "",
      "Replacing star players like Matheus Cunha and Rayan Ait-Nouri were the trickiest of tasks for any Premier League club last summer, and Wolves did so…very poorly.",
      "Ait-Nouri’s replacement, David Moller Wolfe, cost £10m but didn’t really come into the team until Rob Edwards joined. Less can be said about that because Ait-Nouri was important to Wolves, but his importance didn’t come close to Cunha’s.",
      "He basically was Vitor Pereira’s system. That does make replacing him almost impossible, but his importance underlined how vital it is for a relegation candidate to have a proper game-changer in attack. Leeds survived because they had Raphinha. Wolves survived because they had Cunha…and Ipswich, Southampton, and Leicester were atrocious.",
      "Tasked with filling the Cunha void were Jhon Arias and Fer Lopez, who joined for a combined £34m. Neither has impressed, and Wolves only have two points this season, which hints at more complex problems than ‘they couldn’t replace their best players very well’.",

      "In a way it is difficult not to admire Ruben Amorim, the dogmatic Manchester United manager appointed specifically for his unwavering faith in principles which have broken myriad negative records, delivered a 15th-placed Premier League finish and produced one of the most miserable major tournament final surrenders in modern history.",
      "The Portuguese, having realised that Sir Jim Ratcliffe and INEOS have taken a Ludovico Technique-style approach to this infernal staring contest with a manager they have wedded themselves to for better or considerably worse, finally admitted he “would do 75% of things different” if offered the opportunity again.",
      "While that does beg the question of precisely how much of this year-long agony was entirely necessary, it also suggests a level of hitherto denied malleability, the sort required for any coach to succeed.",
      "But it leaves two intriguing points: what things would Amorim change? And far more fascinating: what would he not?",
      "It might ordinarily be assumed that giving Newcastle 66% of the ball at Old Trafford would fall under the 75% of things Amorim would alter but when such a sacrifice of possession is made at the altar of victory, perhaps not.",
      "And the first half especially was generally positive. Patrick Dorgu marked a fine performance on the right wing with a spectacular first goal for the club, Benjamin Sesko led the line admirably, Matheus Cunha sparkled and Lisandro Martinez helped pull it all together at the back as captain.",
      "Yet as with the other wins Amorim has overseen at Manchester United, his 25th was underpinned by questionable calls and a sense of general chaos.",
      "On the face of it, this was a Premier League win, lifting them to fifth in the table, with: a 19-year-old at centre-half partnering a player making his first start in almost a year; their three best forwards of the season either at AFCON or watching from the stands with a dodgy hamstring; a player making the second and longest appearance of his Premier League career at 45 minutes; another making his third Premier League career appearance, and first in a win; and someone playing his first game of professional football in more than seven months.",
      "Ayden Heaven, Lisandro Martinez, Jack Fletcher, Tyler Fredricson and Tyrell Malacia is pure, unadulterated, found-down-the-back-of-the-sofa-in-time-for-Boxing-Day nonsense.",
      "And it just about worked. Only by technicality of the scoreline, the most important technicality of all. But those are three crucial points all the same, the sort which these players and this manager would rarely have held out for in the past.",
      "The awfulness of Newcastle helped. They had four times as many shots as their hosts in the second half and three-quarters of the ball but at no stage did they look particularly likely to decimate the deficit. Beyond the excellent Lewis Hall striking the bar it was an absurdly tiresome slog and a continuation of their away angst.",
      "Those travel travails were summed up neatly by the moment in the second half when Nick Woltemade’s clever flick allowed Jacob Ramsey time and space to move into the area, at which point he stumbled over his own feet and collapsed to the floor.",
      "Both were removed in a triple substitution around the hour mark which Eddie Howe designed to capitalise on the momentum that had long since settled in Newcastle’s favour. Yoane Wissa, Joelinton and Harvey Barnes entered as Manchester United were starting to sink deeper into their own half.",
      "Yet at no real point did Amorim’s side look like caving in. Not when Sesko – and Manchester United’s pressure-relieving forward pivot – was taken off, nor when a bemused Casemiro followed. Not when the manager substituted his two most senior defenders with backs against the wall in the 88th minute.",
      "Some of that is on Newcastle’s inability to create much of note. But it is also credit to Manchester United for digging in.",
      "And it gave Amorim an opportunity to showcase a side of himself which has been lost in the mess of the last year: his charisma.",
      "“Back four, clean sheet, Kobbie Mainoo is injured. I don’t need a press conference, we covered all the subjects, so can all go away and enjoy Boxing Day,” were his CliffsNotes from an evening in which Manchester United made hard work of putting in the hard work, only for it to actually pay off for once.",

      "“They’ve got a few players that they can probably expect to sell. You would expect Rashford to go, which will bring in let’s say £25-30m, so that’ll be positive.",
      "“You would think they will start saving some money because some of these big earners will go. Casemiro in particular will go at the end of the season. There are players like Mainoo that will also help on that side of things.”",

      "According to reports, Al Hilal midfielder Ruben Neves wants to leave Saudi Arabia and has interest from three Premier League clubs, including Manchester United.",
      "Neves joined Al Hilal from Wolves in a club-record sale worth around £47million in June 2023.",
      "The 28-year-old was linked with a host of European clubs, including Man United and Barcelona, before landing in Saudi Arabia.",
      "As is the case with most players his age, it never felt like Neves’ long-term future was in the Middle East and, two-and-a-half years later, he is reportedly keen to return to Europe.",
      "Neves’ contract expires at the end of the season and a renewal looks unlikely.",
      "Man United have been linked with the Portugal international again, with Real Madrid also mentioned, but Galatasaray, Tottenham Hotspur and Newcastle United have now been added to the mix.",
      "According to Sabah in Turkey (via Sport Witness), Al Hilal do not want to lose Neves on a free and the three Premier League clubs are on red alert.",
      "The report says United, Spurs and Newcastle are all providing ‘significant and strong competition’ and are ‘preparing offers’ expected to be submitted during the January transfer window.",
      "With Neves’ contract set to expire in June, he is not expected to cost more than £22m, though a fee as low as £15m is not ruled out.",
      "Neves would be a brilliant signing for Ruben Amorim’s 3-4-2-1 system.",
      "There may be concerns about whether Neves has the legs to cover ground relentlessly for United, but his technical quality is not up for debate.",

      "United need a player who can dictate play while also contributing defensively, which is exactly the sort of midfielder required to play alongside Bruno Fernandes.",
      "Neves could elevate Fernandes’ game to another level, which is quite frightening given the captain is already producing in such an inconsistent and underperforming team.",
      "Newcastle, meanwhile, already have Sandro Tonali operating in the No.6 role, but he could potentially move further forward in a tactical switch similar to Declan Rice’s role at Arsenal.",
      "There might be concerns about a lack of goals from a midfield trio of Neves, Tonali and Bruno Guimaraes, but it would still be a very strong unit.",
      "If Tonali can become what Rice has been for Arsenal as a No.8, Newcastle’s season could turn positive after a miserable first half of 2025/26.",
      "Joelinton appears to be on the decline and a natural replacement for him may be more of a priority than a deep-lying playmaker like Neves. That said, if Eddie Howe sees Tonali further up the pitch, signing the Portuguese midfielder could prove a masterstroke.",
      "Spurs would be silly not to seriously compete for Neves’ signature as well. They desperately need more quality in midfield and their No.6 options are limited offensively.",
      "Joao Palhinha is a brilliant player, but he is not someone capable of unlocking defences or dictating the tempo of a match. Neves can do both.",

      "Manchester United held on to beat Newcastle 1-0 at Old Trafford to move fifth in the Premier League after claiming their first clean sheet since early October; Ruben Amorim started a Premier League game with a back four for the first time since taking charge",
      "Saturday 27 December 2025 10:17, UK",
      "\"Sometimes you need to adapt and there is no tactic in that moment,\" said Ruben Amorim after Manchester United's 1-0 win over Newcastle. He was responding after acknowledging that he had gone with a back six late in the game.",
      "His patched-up side were holding on with Patrick Dorgu and Diogo Dalot playing ahead of the full-backs in a six-man defence. Of course, the fact that Amorim had been playing a back four at all was a fascination and an indication that his team is evolving tactically.",
      "There was a time when he would not have countenanced such a thing but he feels a little more emboldened now, able to adjust from a position of relative strength having got United up to fifth - and potentially even higher before a difficult 2025 is through.",
      "The reason for that growing confidence owes as much to the togetherness as the results, however, and that is the takeaway from this win as much as the formation. Amorim agreed that, in its own way, it was one of the most satisfying wins in that sense.",
      "\"I think it's something that we need to feel that, that we can win sometimes without playing so well, that we can win games with the spirit and with the togetherness in the team.\" He talked of his young team defending every cross and putting bodies on the line.",
      "\"We were suffering a lot,\" he explained. \"We were just trying to survive.\" He was talking about those final moments against Newcastle but it might just sum up his time at the club so far. They came through it, though. Perhaps Amorim will come through it all too.",
      "Amorim finally changed formation and his back four delivered a first clean sheet in nearly three months. Many will be wondering what took him so long - and rightly so - after more than a year of stubbornly sticking to one shape.",
      "He delivered the surprise with maximum impact by having his players warm up in a back three. It was quite the shock when United lined up at kick-off. This was the first time Amorim had started with a back four.",
      "But it begs the question of why now? This can't have been the first such game.",
      "The change becomes even more curious when you hear Amorim's comments about Dorgu, the goalscorer against Newcastle, and how he benefitted from playing as winger rather than a wing-back.",
      "\"You put him in one position that is more in front, the responsibilities are not the same, and he has more freedom to lose the ball. I think it helped Patrick to play better.\"",
      "Amorim's analysis is inarguable. This was probably Dorgu's best performance in a United shirt. But that in itself and the head coach's acknowledgement of it bring us back to that earlier question.",
      "These are points that onlookers have been making ever since Amorim took the job over a year ago. What might have happened had he listened earlier? It makes you think.",
      "Dorgu's improvement will raise questions about how other, better players might have flourished in a different shape. Bryan Mbeumo and Amad Diallo spring to mind for that position on the right wing. It certainly seems a more natural fit for Amad than wing-back.",
      "But perhaps their return from AFCON will signal an end to the experiment. There has been no clear communication about how long this will last.",
      "After spending so long defending his way there is no telling what Amorim is planning long-term. It would seem almost silly in a way, albeit totally necessary, if he were to go back on his word now and move on from solely playing three at the back.",
      "Ruben Amorim's side finished their 1-0 win over Newcastle with a back four of Lenny Yoro, Ayden Heaven, Tyler Fredricson and Tyrell Malacia.",
      "Surely, however, the conclusion for Amorim must be that his previous position of having one shape and sticking to it, regardless of personnel or game state, is a mistake not to be repeated.",
      "There are signs of genuine improvement thanks to Amorim's flexibility. That's what he should stick to.",

      "Amorim's tactical change to a 4-2-3-1 formation with Dorgu playing on the right wing appeared to confuse Newcastle early on, with Casemiro and Benjamin Sesko going close. And though Eddie Howe did adjust, Dorgu's wonderful volley beat Aaron Ramsdale.",
      "The 21-year-old Denmark international has had his struggles since arriving from Lecce last winter but he impressed here even beyond his spectacular goal, although it was Matheus Cunha with his driving runs from deep who lit up the first half at Old Trafford.",
      "Man Utd: Lammens (7), Heaven (8), Martinez (8), Shaw (7), Dalot (7), Ugarte (7), Casemiro (7), Dorgu (8), Mount (6), Cunha (8), Sesko (6).\n\n\nSubs: Fletcher (6), Yoro (6), Zirkzee (5), Fredricson (n/a), Malacia (n/a).\n\n\nNewcastle: Ramsdale (5), Miley (6), Schar (6), Thiaw (6), Hall (7), Guimaraes (7), Tonali (6), Ramsey (5), Murphy (6), Gordon (6), Woltemade (6). \n\n\nSubs: Joelinton (6), Wissa (6), Barnes (6), Willock (6).\n\n\nPlayer of the Match: Ayden Heaven.",
      "Although Sesko did hit the crossbar on the counter-attack, Howe's side certainly stepped up the pressure in the second half with Lewis Hall striking the underside of the bar himself. Amorim had Dorgu and Diogo Dalot as his wingers in a 4-4-2 formation.",
      "Dalot even came close to doubling the lead but it was Newcastle pushing - Lisandro Martinez, on his return to the starting line-up, surviving a VAR call for a penalty against him. They lacked the cutting edge to break down a resolute defensive effort.",
      "Manchester United finished this game with a back four of Leny Yoro, Tyler Fredricson, Ayden Heaven and Tyrell Malacia - a trio of youngsters and a left-back making his first appearance of the season. Martinez had earlier shone on his first start.",
      "The midfield two were Jack Fletcher and Manuel Ugarte, the former having come on for the injured Mason Mount at half-time. On the wings were Dalot and Dorgu. Joshua Zirkzee was up front. That Amorim was able to fashion this into a rearguard action that kept out Newcastle was a minor Christmas miracle.",
      "Manchester United won a Premier League game without Bruno Fernandes for the first time since Ralf Rangnick was in charge.",
      "On the night that Amorim changed his formation, something he had once said he could never do, he comes out of it strengthened. By the victory, of course. But, in a curious way, the manner of it too. It was not fluent but resolute. They are battling to improve.",
      "\"We had to suffer altogether in the stadium. It was really difficult for us. We had a good first half and then the second half we just defend and tried to do something with Cunha. We had our opportunities in transitions.",
      "\"It was a good win, but I had so many games here when we played well and didn't get the three points. Today it was the opposite.\"",
      "\"We have seen a big win for Man Utd. To come out and win an ugly game, specifically from a defensive point of view, keeping that clean sheet. There has to be pride in your defending.",
      "\"The goal was fantastic, a special goal. But if you want to make progress, it has got to be about being defensively solid. It is a start in terms of momentum for the younger players but you have to find something.",

      "\"Second half a lot better than the first but we didn't do enough. It was not for a lack of effort. Felt if we scored we could have gone on to win the game.\"",
      "Asked if he had been caught out by the change of formation by Amorim, Howe replied: \"Caught out? I actually thought we started the game really well for 15 to 20 minutes.",
      "\"But we didn't respond well to the goal. I was disappointed at half time with our inability to grab control of the game because I thought it was there for us to take.",

      "\"I don't think there was a tactical problem for us at any stage of the game. We are disappointed with the way we defended the goal. Long throws were something we prepared for.",

      "\"Sometimes we rely on Bruno for the organisation and creation. We lost Bruno, Bryan [Mbeumo] and Amad in set pieces so this is massive for the team.",
      "\"This is a good chance for Lucha [Lisandro Martinez], Luke Shaw, all of these guys to step up and have more leaders in the group.\"",
      "On who might come in for Fernandes in Man Utd's midfield, Amorim added: \"We have other players. We maybe need to see different ways of playing.",
      "\"I think Jack Fletcher did a very good job [against Aston Villa] and that's why when we have this opportunity, we need to give space to guys like Jack and others. We will find solutions to play.",
      "\"I am confident we can win any game. We have some problems, but I believe in the team, even without many players in this moment. It is more difficult, but I trust in my players. If we are really focused in the game, we can win.\"",
      "Amorim's comments on Fernandes come almost a week after the midfielder claimed Manchester United bosses wanted to cash in on him in the summer but lacked the courage to defy the head coach.",
      "The United captain, who could have joined Saudi Pro League club Al Hilal for £100m, said he was \"hurt\" and \"sad\" about how the situation had been handled in an interview with Portuguese TV station Canal 11.",
      "He said: \"I would love to go back to the last year. We suffer a lot in this moment and I would do things so differently.",
      "\"I learned more this year than the other five as a manager. I will do so many things in a different way, not just in everything but also on the pitch, the way we play the game.",
      "\"No matter what happens in the future, I learned so much and I'm a different manager.",
      "\"It's hard to pinpoint one thing, but to take all the value of the squad that I had last year, maybe it was not the right choices all the time. I watched the games from last season to understand different things.",
      "\"I'm a different manager today. I will do maybe 75 per cent of the things different, but the key things, the red lines would be the same. I think I'm a better manager now.\"",
