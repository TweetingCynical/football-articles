      "Manchester United face Brentford with the Red Devils looking to win their second successive game in the Premier League. Ruben Amorim relieved some of the pressure on himself last weekend thanks to a 2-1 win over Chelsea at Old Trafford.",
      "The beleaguered United boss had been battling mounting criticism with just one win in the league so far. However, goals from Bruno Fernandes and Casemiro were enough to see off Enzo Maresca's side in a game that saw both teams reduced to ten men following the sendings off of Casemiro and Chelsea goalkeeper Robert Sanchez.",
      "Brentford have found themselves in similar trouble to United so far this season. The Bees have only won one league game under new manager Keith Andrews and sit in 17th, just one point above the relegation places, having lost 3-1 to Fulham last weekend.",
      "The clash at the Gtech Stadium will have the added spice of Bryan Mbeumo heading back to his old stomping ground after signing for United this summer.",
      "The 26-year-old forward was at the centre of a transfer tussle that rumbled on for much of the summer until finally securing his move to Old Trafford in July. Brentford also beat United 4-3 in the same fixture last season.",
      "Brentford host United at the Gtech Community Stadium on Saturday, September 27. Kick-off is set for 12:30pm UK time.",
      "Amorim will be without Casemiro after he saw red in last weekend's tie against Chelsea. Diogo Dalot could return however, but the game against Brentford is expected to come too soon for Lisandro Martinez.",
      "Kobbie Mainoo could find himself starting in midfield with Casemiro's absence, while Matheus Cunha is likely to be drafted into United's front line. Altay Bayindir is still expected to keep new goalkeeper Senne Lammens on the bench as he waits for his debut.",
      "Meanwhile, Brentford boss Andrews has minor injury concerns with striker Gustavo Nunes missing through a thigh problem."

      "Cristiano Ronaldo once highlighted his eagerness to play every minute by responding furiously to being substituted during a game at Brentford.",
      "A few months into his turbulent second spell at Manchester United, Ronaldo had already witnessed a managerial change, with Ole Gunnar Solskjaer getting the axe and Ralf Rangnick taking charge on an interim basis. In January 2022, with United leading 2-0 at Brentford, the Portuguese superstar was withdrawn for Marcus Rashford after 71 minutes.",
      "Ronaldo struggled to accept the call, appearing furious as he trudged off while seemingly voicing his displeasure to his boss. However, Rangnick had no issues with Ronaldo's annoyance, maintaining he was prepared to discuss the move with the forward. The German coach quipped: \"I didn't expect him to hug me after being substituted.\"",
      "He added: \"He was asking why me, 'Why do you take me off?' I said, 'Listen, I have to take the decision in the interest of the team and the club. We had exactly the same situation five days ago at Villa Park, being 2-0 up with 15 minutes to play [Villa came back to draw 2-2], and we didn't want to make the same mistake again.'\"",
      "\"I decided to switch to a back five with Harry Maguire and bring on Marcus as another fast winger on the right-hand side, and I think it was the right decision.",
      "\"Cristiano was not happy. He's a goalscorer, he wished to stay on and maybe score himself. But, for us, it was more important to be compact.\"",
      "Rangnick's call proved spot on as Rashford netted the crucial third goal before Brentford managed a late consolation. He responded to that strike by offering Ronaldo some words of wisdom, revealing: \"When we scored the third, I said exactly that to him. I said, 'Look, Cristiano, I understand you're still ambitious and want to score yourself. Maybe in a couple of years, when you're a head coach yourself, you will hopefully take the same decision and be in the same role I was today after 75 minutes.'\"",
      "Rangnick then emphasised there was no rift between him and his superstar player, insisting: \"I have no issues whatsoever with Cristiano. He came back from a little injury, he didn't train for one-and-a-half weeks, and being 2-0 up with 15 minutes to play, having players like Marcus on the bench and even Anthony Martial, why should I not make use of that?",
      "\"And that's why I would always do it again in a situation like that. I've been here now for six weeks, I've never had any kind of issue with Cristiano.\"",
      "Their working relationship proved short-lived, as Rangnick departed the club by mutual agreement the following March. Ronaldo, who is still playing at 40, also left Old Trafford later that year following his explosive interview with Piers Morgan, in which he criticised how the club was run.",
      "United visit Brentford in Saturday's lunchtime kick-off, hoping to improve on their poor recent record at the Gtech Community Stadium. United have lost two of their last three visits, drawing the other. Their last victory there was the aforementioned match involving Ronaldo.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "However, they'll be missing some key players for the early kick-off against the Bees, with Casemiro out of action due to suspension following his red card in the first half of Saturday's 2-1 victory over Chelsea.",
      "Consecutive wins would mark the first time the 40 year old has achieved back-to-back successes since March when United triumphed over Real Sociedad in the Europa League, followed by a comfortable win over Leicester City.",

      "Keith Andrews will be hoping for a return to form as he seeks his second Premier League win of the season. Brentford are just one point clear of the relegation zone after the first five matches and haven't tasted victory since their second game of the season, when they narrowly beat Aston Villa.",
      "Since then, their only success has been in the Carabao Cup, with the last four games resulting in two losses and two draws. Here's the latest injury and suspension news for United ahead of the 12:30pm kick-off.",
      "Injury: Knee.",
      "The Man United gaffer has confirmed that the Argentine centre-back will miss this weekend's trip to the capital. Martinez is still on the mend from a knee injury that necessitated surgery in February.",

      "Manchester United's clash with Brentford on Saturday has been spiced up following the summer saga over Bryan Mbeumo. The lunchtime kick-off will see Mbeumo return to his former club for the first time since his contentious £65million move to United, which could potentially rise to £71m with add-ons.",
      "Mbeumo finalised his transfer on July 21. However, the switch was marred by a dispute between the two clubs. United accused Brentford of inflating the forward's price and pressuring him to reduce his wage demands to secure a larger transfer fee.",
      "United insiders also alleged that Brentford tried to persuade Mbeumo to join Tottenham or Newcastle instead. However, the Cameroon international, a lifelong United supporter, insisted he would only move to Old Trafford and stood firm on his decision.",
      "Mbeumo is likely to receive a warm welcome from Brentford fans upon his return. However, it remains to be seen whether the controversy surrounding his move to United will create a chilly atmosphere between officials from both clubs at the Gtech Community Stadium on Saturday.",
      "It's no secret that United have had a tough time at Brentford's home ground since the Bees earned their Premier League stripes in 2021, establishing themselves as a formidable top-tier team.",
      "Despite securing a 3-1 victory during their first visit under temporary manager Ralf Rangnick, the win was overshadowed by United legend Cristiano Ronaldo's infamous tantrum.",
      "The following season saw Erik ten Hag's United suffer a crushing 4-0 defeat in his second match at the helm, leading him to order his squad to report for a gruelling 14km training run the next day - the distance they were outpaced by Brentford.",
      "In Ten Hag's second trip to Brentford, it seemed a last-gasp goal from Mason Mount in the 96th minute would secure the win, only for Brentford to equalise in the 99th minute, resulting in a 1-1 draw.",
      "Ruben Amorim's initial visit to Brentford in May concluded with a narrow 4-3 loss. The United gaffer is hoping to turn the tables this Saturday by clinching back-to-back league victories for the first time since taking over, following last Saturday's hard-won 2-1 success over Chelsea.",

      "The pressure has eased on Ruben Amorim following Manchester United's 2-1 win over Chelsea last weekend. But more hazards lurk just round the corner, with United's trip to Brentford this weekend chief among them.",
      "The Red Devils face the Bees and newly-promoted Sunderland before the international break, when tricky fixtures against old rivals Liverpool and Europa League side Nottingham Forest loom into view. Nevertheless, it has been a positive week for Amorim, who has been able to welcome Diogo Dalot back into full training and seen the club make progress on two transfers for highly-promising youngsters.",
      "With two defeats in their opening five Premier League games and having been unceremoniously dumped out of the Carabao Cup by Grimsby, it's probably fair to say United have had a somewhat underwhelming start to the season.",
      "However, that doesn't appear to have affected morale around Old Trafford, according to Bryan Mbeumo. The forward was one of the club's marquee buys in the summer, joining from Brentford in a deal worth more than £70million.",
      "He has already scored twice for his new employers, a tally he'll be hoping to add to against his old club this weekend. Mbeumo has now spoken about his arrival at United, including the positive atmosphere around Carrington.",
      "\"They [the United players] have welcomed me straight away,\" Mbeumo said. \"They're a big part of it. Changing city or club always needs a bit of time, but everyone helped me a lot.",
      "\"When I first arrive somewhere, I don't like to be loud or show myself a lot, but I can go with people well and now that's what I've done. It's been great. It's a big club – everything about it – and I'm really happy.",
      "\"The team-mates and staff and everyone at Carrington are lovely people, so you really want to come and work here every day. So it's really good.\"",
      "Once upon a time there was a genuine belief that Marcus Rashford could depose Wayne Rooney as United's all-time top goalscorer. Events over the last 12 months mean that is now extremely unlikely, with Rashford enjoying life on loan at Barcelona, who also have an option to buy the England centre-forward.",
      "Rooney's advice to Barca star while he was still at Old Trafford has now emerged after the former Everton man spoke about Rashford on his Wayne Rooney Show podcast.",
      "\"I spoke to Marcus Rashford on this a couple of years ago, because I felt he was slowing the ball down too much and passing back and turning,\" Rooney said. \"I said, right, when you get the ball, all you need to do is get a full back one v one, knock it past him and run.\"He won’t catch you. And even if they do, you might win a free kick, might win a penalty, you get a throw-in high up the pitch. Be positive, because if you ask any defender, that’s what they don’t like, and then running behind off the ball.\"It’s so simple to be effective that way. And now players may want to do four, five, six step overs, and then they get a clip on YouTube, which they can show everyone. That’s the way it’s going.\"",
      "Amorim relieved the pressure on himself with last weekend's 2-1 victory over Chelsea. But that hasn't stopped the punditry world from chattering away about the Portuguese manager's future – and who could replace him.",
      "Former Blues star Pat Nevin has now weighed in, suggesting that former Red Devils midfielders Michael Carrick and Darren Fletcher could be in the frame, on a short-term basis at least. Carrick is currently out of work after being sacked by Middlesbrough in June, while ex-Scotland international Fletcher is an under-18s coach at Old Trafford. Nevin also offered a theory as to why United are willing to stand by Amorim, despite the issues the club are facing on the pitch.",
      "\"Short term, I wouldn't be surprised at [Carrick or Fletcher to replace Amorim] at all,\" Nevin said, speaking to gaming news publisher Escapist Magazine. \"That would be absolutely fine. And they might do well.",
      "\"They offered the caretaker role to Ole first didn’t they. It takes the pressure off, you can have a good look around. And if he does well, we just keep him. That's fine. You'll get a bit of pressure in the press saying, ‘They don't know what to do, they haven't got a clue, they can't get the right man, all that sort of stuff.’",
      "\"I''ve been there before. I just blanked it. I don't care. I've got a guy doing a good job here and I wouldn't look for the other manager. And I'll say to them, ‘If you keep on doing well, you can get a job.’ I'm not hiding anything from anyone here. I'm looking at every possible option.",
      "\"But what you have to do is give it a number of months in that situation. If it does happen and things go badly for him then you have to have a direction. You have to have a two, three, four, five year plan.",
      "\"Maybe that's been United's problem. They’ve tried, they've had plans. They've had two, three, four, five year plans that have all lasted a year. And that's not good. Because the next person comes in and they change it, the next one changes it.",
      "\"That's the only reason why they're standing by Amorim just now. It's because they know they didn't spend time with the other ones, so we now end up with a Frankenstein team. All bought by different managers. None of it really fits together. And then you find out they got rid of some people they shouldn’t have gotten rid of like McTominay.\"",

      "Following their disappointing 2-1 defeat to Manchester United last weekend, they returned to winning ways against Lincoln City in the Carabao Cup on Tuesday. But Enzo Maresca’s side were largely disappointing and had to fight back from a goal down to beat League One opposition.",
      "As the Blues look to deliver a more convincing performance at home against Brighton on Saturday, there are still question marks over the quality of Chelsea’s squad and Maresca’s ability to get the best out of his players.",
      "Maresca has delivered the hugely disappointing news that talisman Cole Palmer is set for a spell on the sidelines. Palmer was substituted in the first half of the recent defeat to United, after which he was seen putting ice on his groin on the substitute's bench.",
      "The Blues are expected to be without their talismanic playmaker for around two to three weeks due to the ongoing groin injury, which has disrupted his 2025/26 season.",
      "Maresca said at his press conference on Friday: \"We decided to protect Cole a little bit in terms of not letting his injuries get worse. We decided to rest him for the next two or three weeks before the international break to see if he can recover 100% and be fully fit from the international break.",
      "\"I don't think he needs surgery. It's a matter of managing his pain in his groin, with the amount of games, it is something that can happen.\"",
      "Maresca was then asked who would replace the Englishman, before name-dropping Facundo Buonanotte, currently on loan from Brighton until the end of the season, as the player to step up in his place. The head coach said: \"Buonanotte can play in that position. But it depends a little bit on the game, the other team and how they defend. It depends.\"",
      "That could be seen as huge pressure to place on the 20-year-old Argentine, who played his first full 90 minutes in the 2-1 Carabao Cup win over Lincoln City in midweek. But it may also be a sign of Maresca’s faith in the player, who impressed by scoring the winner and his first goal for the club in that outing. However, the youngster is ineligible to face his parent club Brighton this weekend.",
      "Robert Sanchez’s red card against Manchester United and Filip Jorgensen’s poor display against Lincoln City have done little to alleviate concerns over Chelsea’s goalkeeper position. But the Blues are reportedly now eying up a move for Mike Maignan.",
      "France’s first-choice goalkeeper was heavily linked with the west Londoners in the summer transfer window, but Chelsea failed to agree a fee with AC Milan. However, the 30-year-old is in the final year of his contract at the San Siro, meaning he can either be bought for a cut-price in January or signed as a free agent next summer.",
      "TBR reports that, despite United’s interest in Maignan, Chelsea are further along than their Premier League rivals in their negotiations with the shot-stopper, who is considered one of the best in Europe and is said to specifically want a transfer to Stamford Bridge. Whether Chelsea opt to wait until next summer for the experienced goalkeeper or look to sign him in January remains to be seen.",

      "Ruben Amorim has admitted he still never knows which version of his Manchester United team will turn up for games. But the United boss said he no longer travels to games dreading them like he did last season, because he knew beforehand his players were not able to compete with their opponents.",
      "United travel to Brentford on Saturday with Amorim aiming to put together back-to-back wins in the Premier League for the first time since taking charge nearly a year ago.",
      "It is a damning statistic for Amorim and underlines the unpredictable nature of his players, with the 40-year-old head coach admitting even he does not know what to expect when they play. “It's normal that the fans don't know what's going to happen in the next game,” said Amorim.",
      "“To be honest, I have an idea, but I don't know how it's going to be and I'm the manager of the team. The best way of dealing with that is approaching every game like it's the last one. I always have the feeling that we can win the next game and we can be dominant. I have that feeling now. It's in our hands to change things.",
      "“What I'm saying is that sometimes in the small things, in that urgency, if you compare the way we started against Chelsea, to the way we started against City, it's completely different. So in that, I'm not certain all the time what's going to happen and I'm really clear on that with you and with the players, but the feeling is completely different.",
      "“I look at my team and I'm going to play against City, Arsenal and I'm feeling that we can score goals, we can be dominant, we can control the game in certain moments, so it's a completely different feeling from last year. I know it's going to be tough, but it's more excitement than fear, this year. But it's about the way we're going to do the warm-up and the preparation.",
      "“If we're excited to go to the game like we are sometimes when we are at the limit and if we always have that feeling, I think it's going to be massive for us. So it's massive to win this game.”",
      "Bryan Mbeumo returns to his former club for the first time since leaving for United in a £71million deal, with Amorim claiming the forward can help change the negative mentality among his players.",
      "Mbeumo, who has scored twice already for United, was voted their player of the month for August and Amorim said: “If you look at Bryan in that moment when we're struggling, you feel a different guy compared to the rest of the team.",
      "“You have to understand that some of the guys have been here for a while and that feeling is still here and for that we need to win games.”",

Against that backdrop, Amorim has told his players they must show the same energy, focus and aggression they display against the so-called smaller teams, not just the big guns.",

      "Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink has questioned why Manchester United failed to make a serious move for Nicolas Jackson before his summer exit. United were among the Premier League clubs linked with the Senegal striker during the window as his departure from Chelsea appeared inevitable.",
      "Bayern Munich completed a deal to sign Jackson, despite enduring multiple twists following reports that the move was blocked after Liam Delap's injury setback. However, Jackson eventually signed for the German giants on transfer deadline day.",
      "Ruben Amorim's side was among the most active sides in the market. They focused heavily on bolstering their attacking options, with Benjamin Sesko joining Bryan Mbeumo and Mathues Cunha.",
      "Hasselbaink, who bagged 87 goals across 177 outings for the Stamford Bridge outfit, leapt to Jackson's defence, expressing his amazement that neither United nor Newcastle pursued the striker.",
      "\"I've always liked Nicolas Jackson,\" Hasselbaink told Betway. \"I think he could bring something to the team, but obviously two strikers have come in and he felt that he was not going to play as much as he was.",
      "\"He wanted to leave and you can understand that. I think Chelsea were happy to sell him.",
      "\"I was just surprised that Newcastle or Man Utd didn't try to get him.",
      "\"But he asked to leave, and I don't know what I can say about that really. He's at another club outside of England and I think Chelsea wish him well.\"",
      "Jackson secured his move to Bavaria on deadline day, with the deal keeping him at the Bundesliga outfit on loan until the season concludes.",
      "It has been claimed that the 24-year-old's temporary switch will become permanent if he reaches a specified number of appearances - netting Chelsea a reported £56.2million for the former Villarreal star.",
      "It has been a tough start for the forward. So far, he has failed to register a goal in his opening three outings in Germany, including a brief substitute appearance against his parent club in the Champions League as Harry Kane's brace helped defeat Enzo Maresca's team 3-1.",
      "Sesko has also drawn a blank in his early United stint following a sluggish beginning to Premier League life.",

      "Manchester United have reportedly revised their plans for the new Old Trafford, ditching the controversial canopy from their initial designs unveiled earlier this year.",
      "The club had released concept images and videos of their proposed 100,000-seater stadium in March, which included a massive, umbrella-like canopy. The design aimed to create a modern, sustainable destination complete with a public plaza.",
      "On a clear day, the canopy, held up by three masts, would be visible from as far away as Liverpool. However, the ambitious design was met with mixed reactions from United's fans. Critics described the colossal structure to a circus tent, and the cost of constructing and installing the canopy alone was estimated to be between £300million and £400m.",
      "Fast forward a few months, and according to The Athletic, the club is now exploring different options for their new stadium. It's reported that the so-called 'vast umbrella' was scrapped due to space constraints.",
      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe explained at the time: \"The brief to Norman Foster here was to build the world's most iconic football stadium. It had to be a stadium which was recognisable around the world.",
      "\"We said to [architect] Norman that we would like a stadium where when anybody in the world sees that stadium, they'll know it's Manchester United. It's more than a new stadium.",
      "\"Everyone knows the Eiffel Tower, everyone wants to visit. Everyone in the world will want to come visit this stadium. I think the design of the stadium is a 10 out of 10. I think it's a really special design.\"",
      "After a review, sources have allegedly described the revised designs as more aligned with conventional stadium aesthetics. Nevertheless, talks are still reportedly continuing and Foster's design remains 'on the table.'",
      "Conversations are understood to have occurred with Freightliner, which controls much of the territory to the west of the existing stadium that had been designated for part of the new stadium footprint and approximately 17,000 homes.",
      "Yet, the report states that Freightliner is seeking around £400million ($535m) for the land and whilst the firm are supposedly prepared to relocate the freight terminal to a fresh site, it is 'so far holding out for a major windfall.'",
      "But should United now proceed without the canopy, the scheme would need less Freightliner territory, enabling construction to advance more rapidly.",
      "Meanwhile, the stadium's precise location is also being examined, as each alternative demands 'different amounts and configurations of land.'",
      "\"The government has identified infrastructure investment as a strategic priority, particularly in the north of England, and we are proud to be supporting that mission with this project of national, as well as local, significance,\" Ratcliffe said after United launched their campaign for government funding.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "He claimed the England centre-back had 'given up' during the contest, which led to a goal, and that he had 'got away with murder' for years at United. Such criticism from Keane after a loss is nothing new, but Shaw chose to address the comments following the victory over Chelsea at Old Trafford a week later.",
      "The left-back explained that he agreed with the former captain's feedback and that he 'did not need Keane to tell him' when his performances were not up to scratch. Maguire made his 250th appearance for United against City, and after being celebrated prior to the Chelsea win, the defender insisted that Shaw is an 'excellent player' as he launched a stern defence of his teammate.",

      "Despite an initial bright start in north London, Reguilon lost his place under former manager Ange Postecoglou. He now remains a free agent after his release from Spurs in July, following the expiration of his contract, and making just six appearances in his final year at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium.",
      "Looking to reignite his career, the Spanish star only made 12 appearances for the Red Devils after joining on transfer deadline day in 2023. His arrival at Old Trafford materialised only after United failed to sign primary target Marc Cucurella, who joined Chelsea.",
      "The Spaniard had an inconsistent time working under ex-United boss Erik ten Hag. He came in and out of the team before United ended his time with the club prematurely in the January transfer window of 2024.",
      "His time at United was such a contentious signing with some that former Red Devil Roy Keane once became embroiled in an argument with ex-Liverpool midfielder Jamie Redknapp, after the latter had claimed that Reguilon was a good left-back.",
      "Keane, referring to the player's one season stint at Real Madrid in 2018/2019, then said: \"Is that why Real Madrid let him go? Why did Real Madrid let him go?\" Redknapp then doubled down on his take as he replied: \"Does that matter? Just because Real Madrid let him go doesn't make him a good player? He's a fantastic left-back.\"",
      "Despite his brief spell at Old Trafford, Reguilon harbours no ill feelings towards United. \"It has been great to play for Manchester United and I just want to say thank you to the club, the fans and my teammates,\" he said upon leaving, adding: \"It was a privilege to play for this huge club. I wish all the best for the Red Devils.\"",
      "After departing United, Reguilon then joined Brentford in January 2024, where he made 16 appearances before leaving in the summer and returning to Spurs for the final year of his deal. Upon arriving at Brentford, Reguilon praised their former boss Thomas Frank, who is now in charge at Tottenham.",
      "He said: “I'm very happy, I think this is what I need now in this moment in my career. I want to meet my team-mates and play with them, and now just enjoy my football on the pitch.",
      "“Thomas was key in this move, for me. I'm in a moment where I need to play consistently and I think this club can give me that. These six months, I will do everything for the team, but it’s also important for my future. I'm happy after my conversation with Thomas; he knows me very well.",
      "“We had many conversations about everything. I remember the first time was more than 40 minutes talking about football, about everything.\"",
      "Reguilon is now on the hunt for a new club and had been linked with Everton. However, the Spaniard is more likely to return to his home country, with Seville and Real Sociedad thought to be interested.",

      "Former Manchester United striker Danny Webber has thrown his support behind Benjamin Sesko after the Slovenian's sluggish beginning at Old Trafford. The 22-year-old joined United from RB Leipzig during the summer transfer window in a deal potentially worth £73.7million.",
      "The Red Devils pipped Champions League outfit Newcastle United to Sesko's signature, whilst Arsenal had also shown interest in the forward before choosing to snap up Viktor Gyokeres from Sporting instead. Sesko has struggled to find his feet at M16, failing to find the net in six outings for Ruben Amorim's side thus far.",
      "The Slovenia international was also hauled off at the interval against Chelsea last weekend following Casemiro's dismissal just before half-time. And Webber, who understands the pressures of playing up front for United having made three appearances for the club between 2000 and 2003, has defended the young striker.",
      "\"I feel it's sometimes unfair for Sesko, and I felt the same with [Rasmus] Hojlund. When you're asking somebody at that age to come in and be the starter for Man United and lead the line - it's an unfair expectation. The price tags would suggest differently because that's the market, and as a striker, it's such a specialist position that you need to know how to play it.",
      "\"If you look across the board, the strikers in the Premier League who have done well, you take Harry Kane for example, when he was in the Premier League, he did his legwork, he went to places where he didn't score so many goals, but everywhere you go, you're building and you're adding to your arsenal.",
      "\"Ollie Watkins, who has been a consistent performer now in the Premier League, did his legwork. You look at [Matheus] Cunha and [Bryan] Mbeumo, who came in; they've gone and done their legwork prior, so none of them came in at 21, 22, and were just scoring 20 to 30 goals consistently every year.",
      "\"So I feel that it's a tough school for him to come in and just hit the ground running. That said, I do think he's got the ability to do so. It's got to come from him as well, and working at your game every day, analysing your video, having presence on the pitch, speaking to your team-mates, and telling them what you demand from them as a striker.",
      "\"He's had a slow start. Trying to acclimatise very quickly to the Premier League, and it doesn't help when you've not had a consistent preseason either. But I do think that he's got all the tools to be a very good striker for Manchester United. I do feel that he needs a bit of time.\"",
      "Regarding United's campaign overall, Webber insists nobody should get ahead of themselves but acknowledges Amorim's squad must piece together a sequence of victories to establish some desperately needed belief.",

He provides expert coverage on Manchester United and Manchester City, the Premier League as a whole, and the England football team. Jeremy has covered football, rugby and cricket World Cups, as well as Wimbledon, the golf majors and the Olympics.",
      "Up to now, the life of Bryan (Mbeumo) has felt anything but biblical. Surreal, yes, which would be in keeping with the 1979 film made famous by Monty Python .",
      "But just like leading character Brian Cohen, Mbeumo has been mistaken for being some sort of Messiah, where Manchester United are concerned. Mbeumo went from being a big fish in a small pond, to someone with everything to prove when he left Brentford to join United this summer - a move which left lingering resentment between the two top-flight outfits.",
      "He also swapped one of the best run football clubs in the Premier League, for one of the most dysfunctional. United's problems have been desperate and dark in recent times. Which means Mbeumo could be forgiven for feeling a bit more comfortable when he returns to more familiar surroundings on Saturday.",
      "Mbeumo deserves a warm welcome when United take on Brentford. He scored 20 goals in what proved to be his swansong, and helped leave Brentford in a much stronger position than when he joined them in 2019. And he might have felt ready for that next step.",
      "But nothing can prepare someone like Mbeumo for what awaits them at one of the biggest clubs on the planet. But also one that is now one of biggest underachievers as well.",
      "The pressure and demands placed on those who choose to make Old Trafford their new home are on a par with Real Madrid at times.",
      "United supporters demanded success, because Sir Alex Ferguson did what he did to embed it in the club's DNA. And the shirt has worn heavy on the shoulders of United players since the club last won the Premier League title in 2013.",
      "Mbeumo chose to be part of this, having rejected offers from other clubs to force through a move to United.",
      "You have to be built of stubborn and strong stuff to make it in the red half of Manchester. And Mbeumo has made a bright start, winning the 'player of the month' award for August.",
      "He has scored twice in six appearances, but one of these counts for nothing, because it came in United's humiliating and humbling Carabao Cup defeat to minnows Grimsby Town. The inquest which followed was long and loud.",
      "And it will have opened Mbeumo's eyes to how much noise surrounds his new club on a constant basis. The scrutiny is relentless - and can reduce some players to rubble.",
      "And with Mbeumo hailed as one of those signings who can help lead Ruben Amorim's team back to where United have an entitled belief they should be, that pressure is now immense.",
      "And this weekend, along with many more in the future, will show us whether Mbeumo will stand or fall.",

      "Manchester United legend Rio Ferdinand has hailed the club's 'remarkable' start to the season but warned the Reds not to get complacent ahead of their weekend clash with Brentford. Amorim, the man at the helm at Old Trafford, has faced a barrage of criticism this season following a series of mixed results.",
      "The only Premier League losses so far have been against Arsenal and Manchester City. However, the lacklustre draw against Fulham and the less-than-convincing win over Burnley have left fans feeling underwhelmed.",
      "Last weekend's 2-1 triumph over Chelsea at Old Trafford eased some of the pressure on Amorim, but any slip-ups against struggling Brentford will undoubtedly reignite questions about the Portuguese head coach's suitability for the role. In an exclusive chat with The Mirror as part of the Talking Futures – Half Time Talks initiative, Ferdinand expressed his cautious satisfaction with United's performance so far.",
      "\"I think I am more satisfied than anything,\" he revealed. \"I am not jumping and punching the air, going crazy because we still lack that consistency.",
      "\"But I think the run of games that we have had, I think there is nobody in the league who has had a harder start to the season in terms of opponents. But, to get seven points like that was rather remarkable really and I think that's a positive to take out of it.",
      "\"At the same time, as a football club, you only really get taken seriously when you show a level of consistency with results and I think that is something which is a definite ask and demand of these players.\"",
      "Despite a mixed start in the Premier League, United suffered an embarrassing defeat to League Two Grimsby Town in the Carabao Cup in August, casting a shadow over Old Trafford. However, Ferdinand believes there are still silver linings to be found.",

It's bad because we're two kids from Croxteth, and then we grew up together and obviously we started dating and got married and have kids.

      "Will Ruben Amorim give Kobbie Mainoo his first Premier League start of the season against Brentford?",
      "Mainoo has changed his private chef at home and worked with a private coach during the September international break in an attempt to improve. The youngster is understood to be determined to earn a starting role, with a view to representing England at the 2026 World Cup next summer.",
      "It's encouraging to learn that Mainoo has reacted positively to the disappointment of the denial of his loan request, but it will become harder for him to stay focused if his wait for a league start continues.",
      "Mainoo was an unused substitute in the opening games against Arsenal and Fulham. He has made appearances from the bench against Burnley, Manchester City and Chelsea, and his only start of the campaign came against Grimsby Town in the Carabao Cup second round last month.",
      "Amorim has challenged Mainoo to improve - he provided detailed thoughts on Mainoo's development before facing City - and has confirmed he is competing with Bruno Fernandes.",
      "Fernandes and Mainoo are seen as competitors for one of the midfield roles, while Casemiro and Manuel Ugarte are competitors for the other position. From Mainoo's perspective, that raises the possibility of him hardly starting because Fernandes is practically viewed as undroppable by Amorim.",
      "There was a chance against Chelsea last weekend to move Fernandes forward and start Mainoo because Matheus Cunha was returning from injury and was named on the bench. However, United's captain started alongside Casemiro, who received a second yellow card at the end of the first half.",
      "Casemiro is unavailable to face Brentford on Saturday afternoon. That means Amorim will pick between Fernandes, Ugarte and Mainoo for the two midfield positions in his system.",
      "If Amorim does not budge from his stance on his midfielders, then Fernandes will play alongside Ugarte. Mainoo will be named on the bench and the conversation around the academy graduate will continue.",
      "Amorim will decide whether Mainoo and Fernandes is the best partnership to win the game. And in the circumstances, that may be the case. Ugarte offers more defensive cover, but Mainoo is better on the ball and will be the better option to help control the game at the Gtech Community Stadium.",
      "Speaking before the Manchester derby, Amorim said: \"I believe a lot in Kobbie, but some of you think that Kobbie Mainoo is already done (the finished article). I think he can do so much better, he can improve in a lot.",
      "\"I think for some guys it is enough (their talent), but for him it is not enough. Maybe it’s not fair, but I think I'm helping Kobbie Mainoo, and that’s it. He will have opportunities like the other guys.",
      "\"If I feel during the week that someone is the best player to play, then he is going to play. And that I proved already to every player here. So I believe in him a lot... I have the same thing that you have: that he is a top, top player, but he can be so much better. So I'm focused on that.\"",
      "He continued: \"You have to imagine… Sometimes it's the opinion of a coach. I remember Vitinha was not playing for Wolverhampton.",
      "\"Then nowadays, you can see that Vitinha – maybe – is the best midfielder in the world. So you never know. Something can happen sometimes. The way I play is completely different from the last manager.",
      "\"Sometimes, I look at Kobbie Mainoo and I feel that sometimes he was like – and I watched a lot of games from the Premier League when I was in Portugal – and you can feel that the Manchester United team was really transitional.",
      "\"He was the only guy who calmed down the game. Now we have other players who can calm down the game. We play a different game, and sometimes I expect more from Kobbie Mainoo.\"",
      "It was illuminating to hear Amorim speak at length about Mainoo. He promised that he believed in the midfielder, and it's probably time to prove it against Brentford on Saturday afternoon.",

      "Hello and welcome to the Manchester United transfer blog on Saturday, September 27.",
      "We have a busy day ahead which starts nice and early as the Reds travel to Brentford in the early kick-off in the Premier League. Ruben Amorim will be hoping that his team will be able to build on the momentum created by the 2-1 victory over Chelsea last time out.",
      "There will be a focus on transfers here today. Bayern Munich striker Harry Kane remains in the headlines and he has spoken about a possible return to the Premier League.",
      "Meanwhile, there is talk that Crystal Palace's Adam Wharton is on the radar for United too. All eyes will be on Kobbie Mainoo this afternoon as speculation around his future continues.",
      "Stay tuned for all of the latest live updates throughout the day...",
      "The Reds received good news this week in their bid to bring Adam Wharton to Old Trafford in the future.",
      "According to talkSPORT journalist Ben Jacobs, speaking on The United Stand, Wharton has a gentleman's agreement in place to leave Palace at the end of the season.",
      "If this is the case, United may hope to sign the former Blackburn man for less than the £100m+ price tag that is currently on Carlos Baleba.",
      "German publication Bild understands that United could sign Kane for a bargain £56.7m fee in the summer transfer window.",
      "However, this will only be the case should Kane inform Bayern, before the end of the January transfer window, that he wishes to leave.",
      "It is also believed that Spurs would be given the opportunity to match any fee that is proposed for Kane so United would have a few hoops to jump through to get the deal done.",
      "After becoming the fastest player in the top five European leagues to 100 goals on Friday night, Kane was asked about returning to the Premier League.",
      "He responded:",
      "I’m really happy here at Bayern. I have two years left on my contract. And to be honest, I’m enjoying every minute. I enjoy playing here in front of the fans. I enjoy the team, the coach. So that’s not on my mind at all. I’m just looking forward to this season and hope we’ll be successful.",
      "Hello and welcome back to the United transfer blog this Saturday morning.",
      "It is matchday in the Premier League for the Reds as they travel to Brentford this lunchtime.",
      "While we will be bringing you big match build-up lines, we shall be focusing mainly on transfers including what this man has said about a return to England...",
      "Manchester United will be without several members of their squad for the clash against Brentford.",
      "Amad, who will not feature after being granted compassionate leave after suffering a family bereavement.",
      "\"Amad is not here, someone in his family passed away and we are giving all the support to him,\" he said.",
      "\"For Amad, we are here for him, it's a tough moment. In these kind of moments it's not the most important thing [football]. We can win without Amad, but also we want to win for Amad.\"",
      "Noussair Mazraoui and Lisandro Martinez are both sidelined through injury. Casemiro will serve a one-game suspension for the red card he picked up in the win over Chelsea.",
      "Former Denmark international Mikkel Beckmann believes a move away from Manchester United may be an option for highly-rated forward Chido Obi.",
      "He told Viaplay: \"The reserve team matches… it doesn’t taste particularly good. It’s like when we have our Future Cup matches at home. It’s the reserves who play, and it’s just far from the same as playing first-team football,” he said.",
      "\"I just don’t think the time is right for Amorim to suddenly try Chido Obi out at United.",
      "“He is very, very far from the first team at United. I would like to see him play some senior football at a higher level than just reserves at United.”",
      "Chido Obi was in and around the first-team pictures last season under Ruben Amorim but has largely remained with the under-21s this season after an influx of attackers.",
      "Marcus Rashford grabbed another goal contribution for Barcelona in the 3-1 La Liga win over Real Oviedo on Thursday evening.",
      "The England international was back in the starting XI after being benched for their last encounter for being slightly late to training. That arrived just a few days on from his stunning brace in the Champions League against Newcastle.",
      "Manchester United midfielder Kobbie Mainoo has issued an update to Instagram.",
      "The 20-year-old, who wanted to leave the club on loan this past summer, has been a trending topic in recent weeks with his future seeming uncertain. However, MEN Sport have since revealed that he is working hard at Carrington to impress Ruben Amorim having also hired a new private chef.",
      "The latest update has come on his Instagram story with Mainoo reposting an update from Leny Yoro that shows the duo together in a number of photos. Mainoo is also in the replies of the French defender's post.",
      "A post shared by YL15 (@lenyyoro)",
      "Ruben Amorim has confirmed that Amad and Noussair Mazraoui will both miss Manchester United's trip to Brentford in the Premier League.",
      "\"Licha [Lisandro Martinez} is out. Casemiro is out because of the red card. Amad is not here because someone in his family passed away. We are giving all the support to Amad and understood he needed to return home,\" he said.",
      "Diogo Dalot is in line to replace Amad with the Portugal international returning to training on Thursday. Mazraoui meanwhile, has been ruled out.",
      "\"He [Mazraoui] is out also. He will not be back until the international break,\" Amorim revealed.",
      "Manchester United have been linked with moves for Adam Wharton and Carlos Baleba of Crystal Palace and Brighton, respectively.",
      "When speaking on the United Stand, journalist Ben Jacobs has provided a verdict on interest in both.",
      "At the moment I'm not really aware of Liverpool making a particular push for a deeper-lying midfielder if anything, should Liverpool add, it might be more of an attacking midfielder.",
      "With the likes of Wharton and Baleba, we know that they're going to be in demand. With Carls Baleba, there's going to be two aspects.",
      "One is naturally the market pushing towards trying to sign him with multiple suitors, and Manchester United fans shouldn't be surprised by that.",
      "The second aspect is obviously price, and even though many may feel £100m is a lot of money and something that could get a deal done, Brighton's data and Brighton's approach is to think this is a player that might be a Moisés Caicedo-type fee, £150m or more in 12 months' time.",
      "I think there is a strong possibility that two come in. I don't see a January sale for Carlos Baleba. The slow start to the season has maybe been influenced by some of the summer speculation.",
      "There's other names that could be available mid season if Manchester United have the funds from potentially a Kobbie Mainoo exit, we'll have to wait and see what transpires.",
      "Manchester United could face competition for the signature of Carlos Baleba if they opt to actively pursue his services next summer.",
      "Interest in the Brighton star was made clear towards the latter stages of the most recent trading period and now SportsBoom are claiming that Spurs have joined the race for Baleba but that he still would prefer a move to Old Trafford.",
      "Alternatives for United include Nottingham Forest star Elliot Anderson and Crystal Palace's Adam Wharton.",
      "Hello and welcome to the Manchester United news and transfers live blog brought to you by MEN Sport.",
      "Transfer rumours have continued to circulate around Old Trafford with a move for a marquee midfielder expected. Crystal Palace's Adam Wharton features very high on the club's shortlist.",
      "There is also plenty to look at regarding the futures of Marcus Rashford and Kobbie Mainoo following very different weeks for the two United academy graduates.",
      "To also learn of the latest updates ahead of the trip to Brentford!",
      "Further to the update surrounding Baleba, Jacobs gave United a boost in their hopes to sign Wharton in the summer.",
      "The journalist believes that Wharton has a gentleman's agreement with Palace to leave the club at the end of this season.",
      "Should this be the case, it would be a shock if United do not try and pursue a move for the ex-Blackburn Rovers man.",
      "Some nerves have been jangled recently after reports emerged suggesting that Liverpool were willing to challenge United to sign Carlos Baleba next summer.",
      "However, journalist Ben Jacobs understands this is not the case.",
      "Talking to The United Stand, Jacobs claimed that Liverpool are not looking at the possibility of adding a deeper midfielder due to the ongoing success of Ryan Gravenberch.",
      "Panic soon began to spread after Obi was dropped to the bench to face Athletic Club especially after he made a promising breakthrough into the first team squad last season.",
      "But speaking recently to the MEN, academy head coach Travis Binnion urged fans to be patient with the striker and his development.",
      "It's not easy for him because people look at him like he's a big kid. The key thing there is he's still very young, he's still learning his game. Because he's had exposure with the first-team, I think people expect performance levels that are really consistent and really high. You've got first-team players across the country who don't do that. The expectation on him is high, but he has to deliver the basics, and what he did from minute 30 to 80 when he came off is he pressed, he ran and he occupied two centre halves to give other players space on the pitch to exploit, which is why we dominated the ball. They [City] will say they are not scared of him, but they defended two versus one against him all day. I'm pleased he got his goal because you can toil up there, not touch it, not do a lot, but he got his goal and set us on our way. I'm really pleased with him and we haven't even scraped the top of the iceberg with him. He's got loads to come.",
      "MEN Sport understands that Obi was rested against Athletic Bilbao this week for the U21s.",
      "The striker seemed disappointed as he was named on the bench for the contest against the Basque club in the Premier League International Cup.",
      "However, it is understood the decision was made to rest him due to United's U21s having a busy schedule.",
      "READ MORE HERE",

      "The on-loan Manchester United man came on as a substitute on the 58th-minute mark as he replaced Emi Buendia.",
      "Villa eventually won 1-0 thanks to John McGinn's strike.",
      "Former Premier League star Gabby Agbonlahor has been baffled by United's approach to Casemiro and Harry Maguire's futures.",
      "talkSPORT host Alan Brazil said: “Man United, they’re talking about players that are out of favour and who’s staying. It looks like they might let Harry (Maguire) go but keep Casemiro and I don’t get that,” Brazil said.",
      "“That’s very odd,” Agbonlahor replied.",
      "“Harry Maguire played on the weekend. Harry Maguire for me, he played on the weekend against Chelsea. He’s their best centre-half. I don’t understand that.”",
      "Manchester United are set to sign Charlie Hardy.",
      "And he has since spoken out on the move. He said: “After almost a decade at Derby County, the time has now come for a new chapter.\"",
      "Man United winger Amad has named his three best moments playing alongside Bruno Fernandes.",
      "He said: \"The hat-trick against Real Sociedad, the goal against Liverpool at home, so many great moments.",
      "\"But if I had to pick one, I would say maybe lifting a trophy [FA Cup in 2024] is very special for him.”",
      "Some news from one of Man United's Premier League rivals now. Aston Villa are set to take on Italian side Bologna in their Europa League opener this evening.",
      "On-loan Red Devils star Jadon Sancho has had to make do with a place on the bench for the game.",
      "Elsewhere, Marcus Rashford has been named in Barcelona's starting XI for their La Liga showdown against Real Oviedo tonight. He is still without a league goal since joining the Catalans.",
      "Liverpool are reportedly rivalling United for Gleison Bremer.",
      "Tutto Juve claims that Juventus are aware of transfer interest from both clubs. However, the Turin club are said to have made it known informally that they do not intend to sell the Brazilian, considering the defender a cornerstone of their team.",
      "Steven Railston reports that United are set to sign teenage goalkeeper Charlie Hardy from Derby County.",
      "Hardy will sign scholarship terms at United after receiving Premier League ratification to join. The expectation is for Hardy, who is 16 years old, to play for United's under-18s, who former midfielder Darren Fletcher coaches.",
      "Adam Wharton is said to have a gentleman's agreement with Crystal Palace to leave the club next summer.",
      "The journalist Ben Jacobs, via The United Stand, claims the situation will clearly be one to watch. United are one of multiple Premier League clubs credited with an interest in the England international central midfielder.",
      "United were reportedly willing to sign Eintracht Frankfurt goalkeeper Kaua Santos before eventually bringing in Senne Lammens.",
      "BILD claims United came knocking towards the end of the transfer window, but had an offer blocked by the Bundesliga club and Santos himself. United were reputedly willing to pay them around £22-£26million.",
      "The reported United transfer target Lucien Agoume is said to be someone Arsenal will likely be monitoring as well.",
      "CaughtOffside reports that they looked at the player before signing Christian Norgaard instead as a replacement for Jorginho. They claim that Agoume will remain on their radar over the coming years.",
      "Aston Villa reportedly already plan on signing Jadon Sancho permanently this summer.",
      "National World claims the Midlands club are already keen on keeping the United winger beyond the extent of his season-long loan. They are said to want Sancho on a free transfer when his current contract expires at Old Trafford.",
      "United are said to have made late attempts to sign Conor Gallagher during the summer transfer window.",
      "TEAMtalk claims the England international strongly favours a Premier League move should he leave Atletico Madrid. United reportedly wanted the midfielder on loan last month, but the Spanish side were seemingly only willing to sanction a sale.",
      "Antony has opened up on pre-season while in the United 'bomb squad'.",
      "The winger believes it affected his fitness, quotes via ABC.",
      "I'm a little tired because I didn't do pre-season, I didn't train in Manchester with the team. It was difficult for me. It's a bit difficult physically, but I feel better every day."

      "During his pre-match press conference, Ruben Amorim announced that both Amad and Noussair Mazraoui would be absent for the game. And it was also confirmed that Dalot was back in contention.",
      "Taking to Instagram, Dalot posted a matchday graphic onto his story. While not a 100 per cent guarantee that he will start, players often post matchday graphics onto their social media channels when it is likely that they will play some part in the fixture.",
      "If Dalot is fit to start, he is more than likely going to as there is a current lack of players who can feature in the right wing-back slot. Another player who posted a pre-match graphic on his channels was Patrick Dorgu.",

While Cunha has not posted himself about his availability, his wife Gabriela shared a matchday graphic posted by a Cunha fan account which could suggest that the Brazilian might be in a position to start today.",

The most important thing is to start the game like we did against Chelsea and Burnley. These kind of games, we need to be really focused and have the feeling of needing to win every match.\"",

To be honest, I have an idea, but I don't know how it's going to be and I'm the manager of the team. The best way of dealing with that is approaching every game like it's the last one. I understand the feeling of the fans, so let's start changing that feeling to present ourselves with the urgency of what we need to do on the pitch.\"",

We can win without Amad and we want to win also for him.\"",

It's really important to have top players in our team. If you look at Bryan and Cunha, they have done this for years. It was something we looked at, players in the Premier League.\"",

      "Former Manchester United centre-back Rio Ferdinand has pleaded with the club to find a way of keeping Kobbie Mainoo at Old Trafford as uncertainty surrounding the midfielder's future continues.",
      "However, in the limited time since the summer transfer window shut, Mainoo has remained a bit-part player, leading many United fans to speculate whether or not the Stockport-born midfielder will be remaining at Old Trafford beyond this season or even January, considering that next summer is the World Cup. Speaking exclusively to MEN Sport as he fronts Talking Futures' new initiative Half Time Talks, Ferdinand insisted that he could sympathise with the midfielder's predicament.",
      "\"If he was agitating to get a loan now, if he is not playing in January, he will be agitating and knocking the door down even more to go and get game time,\" the former defender insisted. \"He has had a taste of a tournament with England and came out of it with absolutely flying colours and he will want a taste of that again, and rightly so.",
      "\"You have to have two hats in these situations. If you think about it being a player again, you have got to be thinking about yourself in these situations.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "\"You are lucky to go to multiple tournaments in your career, you are lucky to go to just one tournament, so I understand that with my selfish, football player hat on, thinking about England and yourself. But, at the same time, if you are thinking long-term for Manchester United, I think Manchester United have to find a way of getting this kid in the team, he is a huge talent.",
      "\"Is there another way to get him in the team? What does he need to do? That is the big thing for me, as long as those conversations are going on.",
      "\"Has he asked those questions, or is he being told that this is what he needs to be doing? Is this a requirement? Work on this and then you will get an opportunity and then it is down to him.\" Amorim has spoken openly about how Mainoo is currently in direct competition with Bruno Fernandes for a spot in the team and Ferdinand believes that it should not necessarily be the case that the young midfielder has to wait for the captain to leave before he makes his mark in the first-team.",
      "\"I was a footballer once and if I was in his situation, I would be impatient,\" Ferdinand admitted. \"I am not looking to sit around.",
      "\"I went on loan to Bournemouth and I was doing well and I said to Harry Redknapp at the time, he said he wanted me to come back (to West Ham), but I said I am only coming back if I am playing.",
      "\"Am I playing or not? He said: ‘Listen, I am going to get you game time and you are going to start playing,’ and I was not in a position like Kobbie Mainoo, who has been to a tournament for England and playing really well and playing some big games for United, so I can understand his frustrations. For a young footballer, they want to play.",
      "\"Whatever is going on behind the scenes, I hope there is that transparency and communication as to why he is not playing and how he gets himself back in the team.\" While he can see why Mainoo could be itching to move to get further minutes, Ferdinand was in little doubt about where he wants the midfielder to be moving forward.",

      "Manchester United are said to have drawn up fresh plans for the new Old Trafford and removed the canopy from their plans after it caused controversy when the new designs were revealed earlier this year.",
      "Concept images and videos of the club's 100,000-seater stadium was revealed in March, featuring a vast, umbrella-like canopy - designed to create a modern, sustainable destination alongside a public plaza. The canopy, supported by three masts, would be visible from the outskirts of Liverpool on a clear day.",
      "At the time, it brought mixed reaction with United's fanbase. Critics described the massive structure to a circus tent, and the canopy alone was estimated to cost between £300million and £400m to construct and install.",
      "Fast forward a few months and the club are considering different options for their new stadium, according to The Athletic. It's reported that the so-called 'vast umbrella' was scrapped due to space constraints.",
      "\"The brief to Norman Foster here was to build the world’s most iconic football stadium,\" Sir Jim Ratcliffe explained at the time. \"It had to be a stadium which was recognisable around the world.",
      "\"We said to [architect] Norman that we would like a stadium where when anybody in the world sees that stadium, they’ll know it's Manchester United. It’s more than a new stadium.",
      "\"Everyone knows the Eiffel Tower, everyone wants to visit. Everyone in the world will want to come visit this stadium. I think the design of the stadium is a 10 out of 10. I think it’s a really special design.\"",
      "Following a review, sources have reportedly described the updated designs as more in keeping with traditional stadium aesthetics. However, discussions are still said to be ongoing and Foster's design is 'still on the table.'",
      "Discussions are believed to have taken place with Freightliner, which owns much of the land to the west of the current stadium that had been earmarked for part of the new stadium footprint and around 17,000 homes.",
      "However, the report adds that Freightliner is demanding around £400million ($535m) for the land and while the company are reputedly willing to relocate the freight terminal to a new site, it is 'so far holding out for a major windfall.'",
      "But if United now move forward without the canopy, the project would require less Freightliner land, allowing construction to progress more quickly.",
      "Meanwhile, the stadium's exact location is also under consideration, as each option requires 'different amounts and configurations of land.'",
      "\"The government has identified infrastructure investment as a strategic priority, particularly in the north of England, and we are proud to be supporting that mission with this project of national, as well as local, significance,\" Ratcliffe said after United launched their campaign for government funding.",

      "Manchester United formally announced Stephen Torpey as the head of the academy on Wednesday.",
      "In June, it was confirmed that Nick Cox was set to leave after nine years of service to become technical director at Everton. During his time in charge, Cox has played a pivotal role in United's academy's renaissance, securing top youth signings and overseeing an FA Youth Cup triumph in 2021/22.",
      "Torpey has big shoes to fill. He worked closely with Jason Wilcox at Manchester City and the pair sat together at Old Trafford to watch the Under-21s against Athletic Bilbao on Wednesday.",
      "United have hired Torpey from Brentford, where he worked as the academy director from January 2024. Brentford hired Torpey to essentially build their academy from scratch and deliver Category One academy status. Torpey was previously at City, where he spent nine-and-a-half years in different positions.",
      "Torpey joined City in 2014 and gradually worked his way up in their academy to become the head of coaching between the Under-15 and Under-23 age groups, a role in which he oversaw trophy wins.",
      "The 43-year-old is credited with helping City implement a Barcelona-style coaching system, which has subsequently enabled the club's youth teams to win trophies with a similar style of football to their first-team.",
      "Torpey played a role in the development of Cole Palmer, James McAtee and Rico Lewis, who all progressed through the academy system at City to make senior debuts under Pep Guardiola. He also played a role in player recruitment as part of a team of academy staff who pitched to potential new signings.",
      "After a modest playing career, Torpey explored a career in coaching and returned to former club Liverpool. He was welcomed back to Merseyside as a Liverpool academy graduate, and worked in the youth system while it underwent a period of change, guided by the Spanish influence of Rafael Benitez.",
      "Speaking in a recent interview with The Times, Torpey said: “When you see players walk out for the first team and you’ve worked with them from the very earliest ages, they feel like one of your own.",
      "“There’s no better feeling for a fan than to watch one of your own. I think that’s the challenge here: to try and create that same special feeling for our fans when they see one of our local players run out at the Gtech and play in the Premier League and represent the club that they love.”",
      "Torpey was born in Kirby in Merseyside. He began his playing career in Liverpool's academy and played for the likes of Prescot Cables, Altrincham and FC United of Manchester during a lengthy non-league career.",
      "The new United chief joined FC United in 2005 following the founding of the club as a protest against the Glazer family. Torpey scored the club's first goal in a friendly match against Flixton in August 2005.",

Dalot was forced to pull out of international duty with Portugal during the September internationals, but he could return for the trip to the capital on Saturday.",

      "Former Liverpool coach Thomas Gronnemark has hit out at Arne Slot, Mikel Arteta and other Premier League managers over their “really ugly” strategy.",
      "Gronnemark is famed for working under Jurgen Klopp between 2018 and 2023 and has imparted his expertise on a number of top clubs and national teams as the world’s only professional throw-in coach.",
      "The 49-year-old used to hold the world record for the longest throw-in, at 51.33 metres and has spent 21 years carving throw-in niche for himself, but isn’t impressed by the standard of them in the Premier League this season as we see a huge uptick in the number of long throws.",
      "He claims “the level from Liverpool, Arsenal, Manchester United and Newcastle is really low” in what is a “really ugly” part of the game thanks to the poor strategy.",
      "“You can say there are many more long throw-ins in the Premier League. You can say ‘isn’t that good?’ No, not necessarily! There are far too many teams taking low-quality long throw-ins. Some of the throw-ins are just not long enough, so they’re not dangerous, and sometimes it’s about the strategy,” Gronnemark told Mirror.",
      "“It’s also about entertainment for the fans. People might think that a guy who coaches long throw-ins wants a lot of them. Actually, I don’t. I don’t want to see every team take 10 long throw-ins in every game because then we have too much start and stop.",
      "“People just look at the best teams and say ‘they’re having real success data-wise, so we’ll do the same’. But they are forgetting that there’s a lot of work, many years’ worth, behind it. You have to do space creation around the opponents’ penalty area.",
      "“To be honest, for most teams, throw-ins are a really ugly part because the quality is so low, the ball is being thrown into high-pressure situations where there are duels,” he explains. “There are too many chaotic throw-ins in the Premier League: the level from Liverpool, Arsenal, Manchester United and Newcastle is really low. Possession rates are at around 25 to 33 per cent on throw-ins under pressure. The standard is really low.",
      "“When I was at Liverpool the quality went up, but it’s started to go down again. I think one of the reasons is that they’re only training one or two routines in each zone. Yeah, it can work but your players have to learn to think throw-ins.”",

      "Gronnemark has been working with Brentford this season and they stand out as a team benefitting from their use, having put 23 into the opponents’ penalty area this season, resulting in one goal, 11 shots and 1.29 xG.",
      "“If you’re a world-class throw-in taker, it’s much easier to put the ball where you want with a throw-in than with a corner kick,” he added. “How many corners hit the first man? It’s hard to kick with your foot. It’s much easier to throw with your hands if you have the right technique.",
      "“There are a lot of set piece coaches now and a lot of them treat the throw-in like a corner or a free-kick.",
      "“So they say ‘we can have one or two routines in each zone’. But the challenge is that the opponents’ defending pattern will already mark this from the start then the players have a big challenge.",
      "“Even with the biggest teams in the Premier League, you can see that if they make one move and it doesn’t work then the players don’t know what to do – they’re getting confused, frustrated because they don’t have a high throw-in intelligence.”",
      "Arne Slot has confirmed that Liverpool defender Geovanni Leoni will miss “around a year”, but refused to say he regrets missing out on Marc Guehi.",

      "What’s the ‘only reason’ Ruben Amorim hasn’t been sacked by Manchester United? And which two Red Devils heroes are poised for a caretaker role?",
      "Amorim relieved the pressure with a 2-1 win over Chelsea last weekend but there has been no great sign of improvement after leading them in their worst season in living memory last term.",
      "Incredibly, a trip to Brentford on Saturday lunchtime offers the Portuguese boss the opportunity to win back-to-back Premier League games for the first time as Manchester United boss.",
      "Failure to do so will lead that pressure to build again amid widespread suggestions that his 3-4-3 formation is doomed to fail at Old Trafford.",

      "Carrick is currently without a club having been let go by Middlesbrough in the summer, while Fletcher is coaching the United U18s.",
      "“Short term, I wouldn’t be surprised at [Carrick or Fletcher to replace Amorim] at all,” Nevin said, speaking to gaming news publisher Escapist Magazine. “That would be absolutely fine. And they might do well.",
      "“They offered the caretaker role to Ole first didn’t they. It takes the pressure off, you can have a good look around. And if he does well, we just keep him. That’s fine. You’ll get a bit of pressure in the press saying, ‘They don’t know what to do, they haven’t got a clue, they can’t get the right man, all that sort of stuff.’",
      "“I”ve been there before. I just blanked it. I don’t care. I’ve got a guy doing a good job here and I wouldn’t look for the other manager. And I’ll say to them, ‘If you keep on doing well, you can get a job.’ I’m not hiding anything from anyone here. I’m looking at every possible option.",

      "And why are Football365 trying to get Ange Postecoglou sacked?",
      "Send your thoughts to theeditor@football365.com.",
      "",
      "Longtime reader, first time mailer. Naturally I decided to pop the cherry on a safe and non-controversial topic: Marcus Rashford.",
      "I think the problem with what Ian Watson and a handful of Mailbox ultras have been saying about the ongoing Scholes/Rashford drama is that they think that the reason why what Scholes said is problematic is solely because of the content. It’s not. It’s the very presence of the comment in a public space.",
      "To explain: Paul Scholes is fully entitled to enjoy (or not enjoy) any opinion of Marcus Rashford that he likes. He can hate him for any number of reasons, including – and this is important – stupid, nonsensical ones. Furthermore, as a United fan it makes perfect sense for him to resent Rashford up and leaving them, and there is no sense in demanding that he or any United fan wish him the best.",
      "The problem is that Paul Scholes is not just a United fan. He is a massively famous pundit who is paid, I imagine, a lot of money to talk about football. And what irks me about him STILL moaning about Rashford is just how utterly unnecessary it all is at this point. Love them or hate them, United this season are absolutely delicious narratively. They are either a sleeping giant about to awake or an old palace burning down, depending on your outlook, but the one thing that is totally not part of this saga is Marcus bloody Rashford. He is GONE. It is time to MOVE ON.",
      "I guess what I’m saying is that there seems to be an assumption from old pros that their every opinion deserves to be heard, all the time, no matter what. But I don’t particularly give a monkey’s what Scholes thinks of Rashford as a person. I’m interested in what he thinks of him as a footballer, but modern pundits aren’t quite as vocal on that subject.",
      "There is also something so bitter and nasty about Scholes saying what he said, because as much as it’s fair to hold Rashford responsible for his performances at United, it’s also important to bear in mind that the club wanted him gone. It was generally accepted that he had to go in the summer for his own good and the club’s. So with that in mind, what is the point of seeing a young man finding a new lease of life after years of sullen, uninspired football, and then nastily snipe him from the pundit box? It smacks of spitefulness and is one of the many reasons why I think all the Alex Ferguson old boys – Scholes, Keane, Ferdinand and Neville – have been absolutely toxic for both punditry and United as an institution. If we must talk about United then let’s talk about United, if we must talk about Barcelona let’s talk about Barcelona, but swiping at Rashford for his bad performances last season just drags down the conversation. I would expect better from a man of Scholes’ age.",
      "Correct opinion? Maybe. I don’t think so personally, but that’s not really the point. Why does it actually need to be said, is the real question. Does it enlighten the fans? Does it explain United’s struggles this season? Does it explain Barcelona’s success? No. It’s just meaningless negativity, like so much of modern football.",
      "It also is yet another example of United old boys finding a way to tear down a young black man no matter the situation. Every single time. But let’s not get ahead of ourselves, this mail is long enough as is.\nSamuel, Fulham fan till the end",

      "Dear Reader,",
      "I hope you are all well (or at least caffeinated). I just read two recent F365 takes on Marcus Rashford.",
      "Let me save you some time: I don’t care whether Rashford sulked at Manchester United.",
      "Before you throw a tomato at me for lack of nuance, allow me to explain:",
      "1. Sulking is a spectator’s hobby",
      "If a player is walking, moody, whispering dire oaths in the tunnel — I’ll raise an eyebrow, maybe tweet (sorry X) about it, but I’m not launching moral crusades. Football is messy. Players are people. Sometimes they sulk. Big deal.",
      "2. Would you want to play in the current Manchester United team?",
      "Let me ask you this, dear reader: if someone handed you a contract today to play for this Manchester United — the board, the chaos, the constant managerial churning, the pressure to be more myth than person — would you take it?",
      "Because spare me the nostalgia of “United would have done this” — the United of today is a far cry from the Fergie glory years.",
      "3. Rashford is doing well at Barça",
      "While some are busy flinging “disgrace” accusations, Rashford has started making noise in Barcelona. He’s scoring, contributing, adapting. He’s quieting critics the best way — by playing. And (whisper it) I happen to think that’s more compelling than being praised from my cheap seat at Old Trafford.",
      "4. Even Alex Hunter wouldn’t want to play for Manchester United",
      "Yes, I just dragged a FIFA video game character into this. But hear me out: Alex Hunter (from the FIFA story mode) has tons of dramatic options. If the script handed him the chance to play for Man Utd — under the current regime, under the weight of expectation and instability — I reckon he’d look at his agent and say, “Nah, I’ll play for a mid-tier side and enjoy my life.”",
      "Because even in fantasy land, there’s an escape clause.",
      "So here’s my bottom line: you can publish/ podcast a hundred think-pieces dissecting Rashford’s body language, demeanor, or public statements. But unless you’ve walked in his boots — including the ones he’s now laced up in Barcelona — you should STFU and don’t get to claim moral high ground.\nGaptoothfreak, Man.

      "Long, long time reader of 2 decades. Occasional letter writer.",
      "I wrote in last year about how the site is actively trying to generate managerial sackings and drama, to create negative narratives about clubs, managers and players. For clicks I assume, and instead of analytical articles that are harder to write. The standard of writing has fallen a long way.",
      "I have a 15 year old daughter who has a longer concentration span, and is less fickle and emotional,  more mature . The knee jerking and need to create a story is a far cry from earlier years, where there was mature reporting and genuine humour.",
      "Now we have a site that is essentially a list of top 10s. “Next manager to be sacked“,  “Top 10 replacements for Ange”. A couple of bad results and the narrative begins “X is under pressure”.",
      "Ange has had 4 games. 4 away games. He had a couple days before the Arsenal game, so essentially 3 games. All away. 2 draws where they dominated. Let’s start building an Ange out narrative, spread it across social media until it reaches fans who put pressure on the owner and he pulls the trigger so you can say “we were right”.",
      "He won a major trophy, got Spurs into the CL. Recruited a large number of excellent players. Such is the poor attention span and need for instant gratification people are now disregarding a 5th place finish in his first season. He got lucky at the start of the season apparently. Trying to paint him as though he’s a village idiot. There was a zero percent chance of Spurs going down at any time, and he knew it, so switched attention to CL qualification.",
      "Would fans rather win a trophy or finish 8th? Who had a better season last year, Spurs or Villa? One won a trophy they’ll be talking about for generations, qualified for the CL. Would you rather finish 6- 8th every year, play conservatively and have a cup run?",
      "Oh, and now apparently Emery, the golden boy of the last 2 seasons is now under pressure after a slow start, according to 365. His last 2 seasons don’t count anymore because of a few poor games.",

      "xG is pretty meaningless in telling you about how an individual game has gone. A late goalmouth scramble having been under the cosh all game can massively boost a side’s  xG but isn’t reflective of the whole. The stat only becomes relevant when viewed over a sweep of games, and can then be used to tell you trends of many goals a team should be scoring/conceding and whether they’re getting lucky.",

      "Manchester United rock up to Brentford for the Saturday lunchtime kick-off, with hope in their hearts that they’ve finally turned the umpteenth corner.",
      "We all know they haven’t, especially as United have only won once in the last four visits to the Gtech Community Stadium, but it’s fun to see the hope in their eyes.",
      "Neither Brentford or Manchester United have been bothered by Carabao Cup or European adventures this midweek. The Bees because they knocked Aston Villa out of the third round last week, and Manchester United because they finished 15th last season, well out of the European places, and were knocked out of the cup by League Two Grimsby. Sorry to go into detail there United fans.",
      "United, and former Brentford forward Bryan Mbeumo, arrive in west London with a 2-1 win over Chelsea under their belts and plenty of renewed optimism about the way they played, although the Blues keeper getting sent off within the first five minutes played a big part of that.",
      "Seventeenth-placed Brentford already lurk around the positions that most people expected to see them in at the start of the season.",
      "However, their ‘who is dis guy’ manager Keith Andrews is unbeaten at home from his first three games at the Gtech. A league and cup win over Aston Villa, and a last-gasp draw with Chelsea. It’s away from home they’ve struggled, and the poor 3-1 defeat to Fulham last time out will have hurt.",
      "The last time these two sides met in May they played out a 4-3 corker, although United fans will not want to remember how they fell apart to be 4-1 down before staging a late fightback. They’ll also want to forget a 4-0 thrashing in August 2022, three visits ago.",
      "If United can get over the line here it will be the first time they’ve recorded back-to-back league wins while Amorim has been at the club, and if you whisper it that might just happen.",
      "Andrews’ Bees are looking in rude health with only Gustavo Nunes and Paris Maghoma battling their way back to full fitness.",
      "Dango Ouatarra could be drafted into attack to replace Kevin Schade, while Andrews may be tempted to tinker with his back five after it came unstuck against Fulham.",

      "Diogo Dalot and Lisandro Martinez are still on the injury list ahead of the Brentford game, while Casemiro will serve out a suspension for his red card against Chelsea.",
      "Kobbie Mainoo could get the nod to replace Casemiro, and Amorim will have to weigh up whether the returning Mason Mount and Matheus Cunha return to the starting line-up.",

      "– Brentford are unbeaten at home (W1, D2)",
      "This is a goal-heavy fixture with over 2.5 goals landing in six of the last eight encounters between the two sides. There were seven scored the last time they met at the Gtech in May.",
      "Man Utd have only failed to score against Arsenal and Manchester City, and there’s been at least three goals scored in United’s last four games across all competitions.",
      "Brentford are leaky, having let in eight in the last four, but they are on target at the other end having scored in every game this season.",
      "Combining both teams to score and over 2.5 goals will give you some better odds.",
      "All eyes will be on former Brentford forward Bryan Mbeumo, who has impressed the United faithful in the handful of appearances he has made for his new side.",
      "He has two goals already and while it may be tempting to stick him down for a goal against his old club, shots are a more likely success route.",
      "He has registered a shot on target in four of his last five league games, and is averaging three shots per game.",
      "The Cameroon international will be fired up for this one so stick your neck out for over two shots on target against the Bees."

      "“We make excuses and then he gets a few games under his belt and he’s making decisions like he doesn’t even want to tackle anyone.”",
      "Shaw subsequently issued an honest response, admitting that the pundit had a point as he needs to do better for Man Utd.",
      "The left-back has since been defended by teammate Harry Maguire, with Ferdinand taking time to praise the two defenders.",
      "Ferdinand has backed Shaw to respond by “putting in a performance” against Brentford this weekend.",
      "“Personally I think it is great from Harry Maguire because that is the job of a captain/senior player to come in and defend your players if you think that they are being unfairly treated,” Ferdinand told MEN Sport.",
      "“I also think Luke Shaw coming out and speaking himself is what I like.",
      "“I like to see players come out and go: ‘You know what, I am not having that or actually, they are right. I was under par for the level that I have set myself.’",
      "“I am sure he will put in a performance this week Luke Shaw, that will make you think: ‘He is made of the right stuff.’ I just think that Luke Shaw is a magnificently talented player, he has just been so unfortunate with injuries that he has never been able to maintain his fitness and it goes back to that word again, consistency.",

      "That integrity is a key part of his charisma, which was supposedly a key draw for Sir Jim Ratcliffe and the INEOS bosses when selecting the Portuguese boss as their replacement for Erik ten Hag.",
      "But again, with Brentford incredibly offering up an opportunity for Amorim to earn back-to-back Premier League wins for the very first time, when asked by a reporter in the press conference what the key to consistency is for Manchester United, we would advise Amorim against “complete honesty” when it’s an admission of ignorance.",
      "“It is normal that the fans don’t know what is going to happen in the next game. To be completely honest, I have an idea, but I don’t know how it’s going to be and I’m the manager of the team! The best way of dealing with that is every game is the last one.”",
      "We enjoy self-deprecation as much as anyone, and understand that it’s no more than a jovial, throwaway comment from a man under pressure; someone quite frankly embarrassed that after ten months in charge of one of the biggest clubs in world football he’s yet to win two league games on the bounce.",
      "Without similarly cheeky lines he may not still be in the job, with his press conference manner the key to this aura of stability and confidence he’s managed to fabricate for himself despite the chaos on the pitch.",

      "And of course, like any other football manager, he doesn’t really know what’s going to happen in any game. It’s presumably why he loves football, if he does indeed still love it.",
      "But five games into a new season in which there’s been no great sign of progress after leading them in their worst campaign in living memory, not knowing whether his team is going to be any good or not feels awfully close to the bone of contention that he doesn’t know how to turn things around at Old Trafford.",
      "No Manchester United fan will be turning up for this clash at Brentford tomorrow with any clue as to how their team perform on a scale from not bad to terrible, but should the manager not have more than “an idea”? Or at least put the brutal honesty on hold and claim that he does?",
      "Because as much as anything, we’re not sure it’s an admission the famously fragile Manchester United players will be using as any great motivation to break this two-game hoodoo."

      "Meanwhile every weekend is Big for Big Ange Postecoglou as he has another stab at getting a first win to go with all the lovely attacking football he’s got Forest playing now.",
      "And in not unrelated news, beleaguered Wolves head to London hoping for a restorative visit to Dr Tottenham.",
      "",
      "We once again find ourselves with some degree of sympathy for Arsenal and the machinations of the fixture computer. Liverpool once again have first-mover advantage on a weekend when Arsenal’s task is a difficult one.",
      "Liverpool have no penalty kick themselves at Selhurst Park, but if they can win – via late shirt-removing methods or otherwise – then Arsenal face another Sunday afternoon when any slight slip will come with outsized consequences.",
      "Arsenal could be eight points adrift by the time they kick off at a stadium where their recent record is not good. Arsenal lost twice at St James’ Park last season without scoring a goal, in the league and again in the Carabao Cup semi-finals, extending a record in Newcastle that now reads one win and four defeats on their last five visits.",
      "For Newcastle, this game represents a test of what has been a few weeks of tentative promise since the cruel late defeat to Liverpool. That was a game that featured 83 per cent of all goals scored in Premier League games involving Newcastle this season. Three of their other four games have finished goalless, along with a 1-0 home win over hapless Wolves.",
      "This is a game that should give a pretty clear indication of whether the last few weeks have represented recovery and growth, or just not playing any of the top teams for a bit. At least domestically; there was plenty of encouragement too in a narrow Champions League defeat to Barcelona.",
      "The fact Liverpool have already won here adds another dash of intrigue and jeopardy for Arsenal; it already feels like an achievement that even at this early stage they must match. And a game where all evidence from Newcastle’s efforts outside that Liverpool defeat suggest Mikel Arteta will simply have to release that infamous handbrake of his.",
      "",
      "We’re really not sure how much longer Viktor Gyokeres scoring the wrong kind of goals is going to keep providing a covering narrative for the fact the big-money striker Man United chose after missing out on the Swede still doesn’t have any goals, at all, against anyone up to and including Grimsby Town.",
      "Sesko played the full 90 minutes of that match before infamously stepping up as the last outfield player to take a penalty for United in the dignity-sapping shoot-out that followed.",
      "While he’s been more sporadically used in the Premier League, he has nevertheless now played a tick under 300 minutes of football for United without a goal or assist to his name.",
      "It’s not Sesko’s fault that United paid what they paid for him, nor that he is the latest pawn in the wider United banter circus.",
      "But he’s going to need to start helping himself soon, and a Saturday lunchtime trip to a hollowed-out Brentford side who have shipped seven goals in their last three Premier League games represents just about as good a chance as any at this point.",
      "If anything, has the great man’s start at Nottingham Forest perhaps been too Postecoglou? We really don’t want to complain, or indeed to appear greedy and ungrateful, but it has felt like all the key elements of Postecoglou’s football have been crammed into the last few weeks.",
      "Forest have started playing some truly gorgeous attacking football, and some truly catastrophic defensive football. They have failed to defend leads against teams as diverse as Swansea, Burnley and Real Betis, while the hamstring injuries that plagued Big Ange’s riotously entertaining two years at Tottenham are already making an unwanted appearance in Nottingham.",
      "Sunderland at home would have been a fixture most teams were chalking up as three points when the computer spat out the schedule back in June, but a lot has changed for both Sunderland and Forest since then.",
      "It’s an awkwardly big game now for Postecoglou, with last weekend’s failure to put Burnley away exacerbated by the same failing in the Europa League in midweek.",
      "There are many reasons why Postecoglou is currently a fixture in the manager to watch slot. One, it’s just pretty much always entertaining and who doesn’t enjoy that? But a second reason is the clear and certain sense that we should enjoy it while we can, because it doesn’t feel likely that Angeball is back on any kind of long-term basis.",
      "We’re not yet in must-win territory, even for Mr Marinakis, but there is a sense of ‘if not now, when?’ about Postecoglou’s quest for a first victory with his new club. After Sunderland, it’s Midtjylland and Newcastle before the October international break and Chelsea, Porto, Bournemouth, Manchester United, Sturm Graz, Leeds, Liverpool and Malmo before the end of November.",
      "Manchester United should provide few problems, given Postecoglou’s formline there, but with the rest of that run of games it doesn’t require a vivid imagination to picture it all spiralling rapidly out of control.",

      "It feels wild to be talking this way given just how adroitly Pereira steered Wolves out of trouble back in March and April, but the drop-off has been gargantuan and the context of that six-game winning run starting to look slightly different.",
      "It was a run that featured all three relegated sides as well as West Ham, Manchester United and Tottenham who were very much the worst of the non-relegated teams in the second half of last season.",
      "Six straight wins is still six straight wins, but there has to be some acknowledgement they came against the six easiest possible opponents with very little scope for hope or optimism since.",

      "Coventry could do with turning draws into wins, while Birmingham are still yet to truly settle on their best XI in a brave new world, yet both can be reasonably content with how things are shaping up, both reaching ten points after six games to sit in and around the play-off spots at this early stage.",

      "There have been reports of Liverpool competing with the Red Devils for Baleba’s signature, but transfer expert Jacobs poured cold water on that.",

      "“So if Manchester United want Carlos Baleba, but they don’t have to worry about Liverpool or anyone else, they have to worry about probably finding 100-plus million, maybe even closer to 115 or 120 million, hoping that Brighton want to sell, which is far more likely in a year’s time.",
      "“If it isn’t Liverpool, there’ll be other suitors for Baleba, and that’s the whole point really. Brighton think that, first of all, in a year’s time there’ll be multiple suitors, so the price goes up. Second of all, form, hopefully, from Brighton’s point of view in the next 12 months, also adds to the valuation.",
      "“With Manchester United and senior midfielders, I think there is a strong possibility that two come in. So could it be Baleba and [Adam] Wharton, or two other senior midfielders? Absolutely. First of all, because Casemiro could still depart, even though he’s found favour under Ruben Amorim. Second of all, because Bruno Fernandes could go off to Saudi Arabia, and that could fund the window in 12 months’ time.”",
      "Asked if Man Utd could bid for Baleba in January, Jacobs quickly quashed the idea.",
      "“I don’t see a January sale for Carlos Baleba, that’s the first thing to say,” he said.",
      "“The start to the season may have been influenced by some of the summer speculation. There’s no doubt his head was turned by Manchester United, but we’re so early in the season, I don’t think we can equate a dip in form with a dip in valuation, or a dip in form with a January exit.",
      "“Brighton have shown with several players that they sell when they want to, based on their own long-term plan, and the only thing that may alter the Baleba situation is the fact that David Weir unexpectedly left, and Jason Ayto, the former Arsenal interim sporting director, has come in. So there’s a new voice and consideration over what they do in the market.",
      "“But remember, January is very much a seller’s market. It’s difficult for buyers in a short space of time, and it’s mid-season, and we know Brighton’s approach is to sell on their terms, their timeline, their price.",
      "“In addition to that, with a replacement coming in — all of which would be hard to do in a January window — it would be a big shock if Baleba went anywhere in January. But I also think it’d be equally as big a shock if Brighton didn’t engage more seriously over a summer sale, because these players, when they join Brighton, know there will be a period in time where they can be sold and move on to another club.",
      "“With Baleba, the feeling is that if you look at the whole season, rather than just these first few games, come the end of the season, Brighton feel his valuation will be even higher than the number that they put over his head privately, but not to Manchester United.”",
      "Man Utd ‘leading the race for a No.6’? Not a chance with Liverpool and Man City around. Will the Red Devils have to settle for Carlos Baleba?",
      "Man Utd will reportedly push to sign Brighton midfielder Carlos Baleba in January, which surely means Kobbie Mainoo is being pushed out.",

      "Ben Jacobs says Man Utd-linked midfielder Adam Wharton has a “gentleman’s agreement” with Crystal Palace, meaning he can leave the club next summer.",
      "Wharton has impressed for Palace since signing from Blackburn Rovers in the January 2023/24 transfer window.",
      "Bought for an initial £18million, his outstanding form for the Eagles has seen his value soar to €45million (£39m) on Transfermarkt, though Palace are likely to only entertain offers worth at least £60m.",
      "Wharton was rewarded for his fine form with his England debut in June 2024 and a spot in Gareth Southgate’s squad for last summer’s European Championship.",
      "The 21-year-old didn’t feature for the Three Lions, who lost the final to Spain, despite intense clamour from supporters to see him play.",
      "READ: Man Utd ‘leading race’ they’re going to lose to Man City, Liverpool for three midfielders",
      "Wharton showed elite mentality to bounce back from his international disappointment with a fantastic 2024/25 campaign, helping Palace win the FA Cup and finish 12th in the Premier League.",
      "He has been a crucial player under Oliver Glasner, who lost Ebere Eze to Arsenal in the summer transfer window after Eze scored the only goal in the FA Cup final against Manchester City.",
      "Glasner kept hold of club captain Marc Guehi after his transfer to Liverpool fell through, while Jean-Philippe Mateta and Wharton also stayed at Selhurst Park.",
      "Wharton was linked with a move away in the summer, but nothing materialised amid reported interest from Man Utd.",
      "However, a transfer at the end of this season now appears realistic, as Wharton has a “gentleman’s agreement in place allowing him to leave Crystal Palace next summer,” according to transfer expert Ben Jacobs.",
      "Asked on The United Stand if Liverpool are interested in signing Man Utd-linked Brighton midfielder Carlos Baleba, Jacobs dropped the transfer bombshell regarding the Palace and England youngster.",
      "“I’m not really aware of Liverpool making a particular push for a deep-lying midfielder,” he said. “Should Liverpool add, it might be more of an attacking midfielder.",
      "“With the likes of Adam Wharton and Carlos Baleba, we know that they’re going to be in demand.",
      "“My understanding with Wharton is there’s this kind of a gentleman’s agreement in place allowing him to leave Crystal Palace next summer. So that’s clearly going to be one to watch.",
      "“In the same way that Eberechi Eze, even though it wasn’t his release clause, was allowed to depart even after the release clause expired. I think Wharton could leave Crystal Palace next summer.”",
      "Jacobs also says that Man Utd could add two midfielders next summer after failing to land £100m-rated Baleba, with Bruno Fernandes potentially moving to Saudi Arabia and funding a big transfer window not ruled out.",
      "“And then with Manchester United and senior midfielders, I think there is a strong possibility that two come in,” he added.",

The extra adoration reserved for academy graduates also comes with the responsibility of maintaining the standards set by those that came before.",
      "Instead, as Scholes put it, Rashford ‘quit on United’. Whether he was exasperated or not, the evidence offers no other conclusion.",
      "Over 18 months, Rashford’s actions and demeanour spoke of a player who steadily gave up on his club. Repeated disciplinary breaches, the barely-arsed body language… the writing was on the wall long before Henry Winter posted it on X.",
      "When Ruben Amorim arrived last November, Rashford was certainly not alone in giving the impression that just going through the motions was too much to ask.",
      "The rotten standards prompted anger from supporters towards many players, most notably Jadon Sancho and Alejandro Garnacho. But those faces are quickly forgotten. The disappointment and regret over Rashford inevitably lingers.",
      "No doubt he was held to a higher standard. Hardly unfair when you consider Rashford’s pedigree and his status as one of the club’s highest earners. But in the end, the bare minimum was too much bother, an attitude that prompted some sympathy, some acrimony, but now mostly apathy towards the one-time local hero.",
      "“I really struggle to feel happy for him,” said Scholes, a stance that angered Steady and a few more besides. Including The i’s Pete Hall, who writes that Scholes’ criticism and previous narratives around Rashford amount to ‘bullying’. Knowing Pete, once of these parts, that’s a genuine belief. And given his leaning towards United, it highlights that no view on Rashford is unanimous.",
      "The witch-hunt in the right-wing media which attempted to smear Rashford amid the activism that prompted so much pride among United fans – that was bullying. Calling out his woefully-slipping standards as a footballer, one awarded one of the highest contracts in the history of his club, is not.",
      "So there are plenty of Stretford Enders who would echo Scholes’s sentiment. And that’s a reasonable reaction – human, even – in the circumstances. Only the most bitter would take satisfaction should Rashford flop at Barcelona, but neither should United fans be made to feel as though they ought to be cheering him on at the Nou Camp after he chose the path of disinterest out of Old Trafford.",
      "Rashford’s thunderb*stard at Newcastle in the Champions League last week will have caused many eyes in Manchester to roll. For United fans know better than anyone how Rashford is capable of such moments of brilliance having witnessed plenty for themselves. But those eyes will have rolled all the way back when news emerged of what followed next.",
      "With a brace at St James’ Park to build upon following an otherwise inauspicious start at Barca, Rashford turned up late for duty the following matchday. By two minutes, apparently.",
      "The level of his tardiness does not matter, especially when it is part of a pattern of behaviour. When you have unquestionably fallen upwards to a club as prestigious as Barca, where judgements are still being drawn by a new, hard-to-please manager, team-mates and fans, it is damning that it did not occur to him to be in at 9am, rather than skirting close enough to the 9.30am deadline to miss it.",
      "Damning but no longer surprising. Which goes a long way to explaining why Scholes and many others are returning the indifference that dripped off Rashford as he sloped towards the United exit.",
      "Paul Scholes was ‘bitter’ and ‘nasty’ in an assessment of Marcus Rashford which captured a ‘spitefulness’ still holding Manchester United back.",
      "Spurs are definitely about to sign stars from Chelsea, Bayern Munich, Real Madrid and Barcelona while keeping Djed Spence and his penitentiary at left-back.",
      "Has the Club World Cup absolutely cocked up Chelsea’s season? It’s starting to feel like that with such a long injury list.",
      "Every Arsenal game currently seems to be wracked with tension, and a trip to Newcastle will be no different on another Big Weekend.",
      "Liverpool will probably manage without their fourth-choice centre-half and there are a fair few reasons why panicking over Eberechi Eze at Arsenal is daft.",
      "According to reports, FC Barcelona face missing out on Marcus Rashford as Manchester United are set to receive a ‘bigger than expected offer’."

      "However, a move did not accelerate as Man Utd were unwilling to do business with Daniel Levy, so Kane joined Bayern Munich instead in a deal worth around £86m.",
      "Kane, unsurprisingly, has been a revelation at Bayern Munich, scoring 98 goals in his 103 appearances for the German giants. He has also won his first team trophy under Vincent Kompany, lifting the Bundesliga at the end of last season.",

      "Man Utd face potential competition from Spurs for Kane, though a report from The Daily Star claims the striker’s clause ‘hands’ the Red Devils a ‘dream transfer scenario’.",
      "The report claims that he is ‘expected to leave’ Bayern Munich next year, as he is ‘eager’ to return to the Premier League, while Man Utd are ‘potential suitors’.",
      "As well as Kane, Man Utd are also said to be looking to the future with their transfer business and Africa Foot are reporting that they have turned their attention to ‘Senegalese prodigy Mouhamed Dabo’.",

      "The teenager is said to be ‘on trial’ at Man Utd and while Barcelona are ‘closely monitoring the situation’, he is ‘very close to signing’ for the Red Devils.",
      "The report claims:",
      "‘The player has been playing at Manchester United’s Carrington training ground for several weeks, where he’s been training with the youth teams. According to our information, the feedback has been very positive. The English club’s coaching staff has been impressed by his all-around skills: clean tackling, vision, composure, ball control, leadership, relentless work, progressive passing, and pace control.",
      "‘FC Barcelona hasn’t said its last word. The Catalan club is also closely monitoring the progress of Mouhamed Dabo, who completed a month-long internship at La Masia, Barça’s famous training centre, as revealed exclusively by Africafoot at the time. Seduced by his performances, the Spanish club is keeping a close eye on the case, even if Manchester United seems to have taken a head start.’",
      "Real Madrid are reportedly considering a move for Bayern and England superstar Harry Kane, who can leave the German club for less than £60m next summer.",
      "According to reports, Harry Kane has already reached an ‘agreement’ for his next move amid interest from Manchester United and Tottenham Hotspur.",
      "Gary Neville is doing his best to suggest Harry Kane might move to any other Premier League team other than Tottenham. Chelsea, anyone?",
      "Tottenham head coach Thomas Frank admits that he “would like to see” Bayern Munich striker Harry Kane return to Spurs as soon as possible.",
      "Harry Kane has not become ‘more than a striker’ at Bayern Munich; he was always this brilliant but he remains underappreciated in England.",

      "Obviously, Liverpool have benefited from some excellent finishing; they have outscored their xG by almost four goals.",
      "Now you might reasonably ask what XPts are.",
      "According to football analytics expert McKay Johns:",
      "In a basic approach, xPts is calculated by simulating each shot in a match.",
      "For each shot, the model will generate a random number between 0 and 1. If the number is less than the value of the xG of that shot, it says it is a goal and adds to that game’s simulation tally, and at the end compares the actual goal tallies.",
      "If a team wins that simulated match they get 3 points, draw they get 1 point, and a loss they get zero.",
      "Running that same simulation over many iterations (say 1000) gives the output of how often a team would have won, drawn, or lost, and then we can take the average of all the points they have accumulated in the simulations to get their expected points which will fall between 0 and 3.",
      "So basically, it’s running the game through algorithms and working out the average of how many points should have been garnered from each match according to the xG created and the xG conceded.",
      "As Johns says: ‘The stat does well at giving us a decent idea of how many points a team should get on average, especially over a season.’",
      "Over the first five Premier League games, there is a shock name at the top of the Premier League xPts table, as calculated by Understat.",

They are closely followed by the equally impressive Crystal Palace.",

      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe and the INEOS bosses are ‘notably unhappy’ with the ‘frustration’ over Ruben Amorim’s contentious system and philosophy at Manchester United.",
      "Amorim relieved the pressure through a 2-1 victory over Chelsea last time out but there are still widespread concerns over his 3-4-3 formation at Old Trafford, and ahead of that win it was claimed he was ‘losing the confidence of the dressing room’, with ‘senior players’ questioning his tactics.",
      "Ratcliffe was at Carrington to meet with Amorim ahead of Sunday’s game, with Amorim joking that he was there to offer him a new deal.",
      "“New contract, he was offering me a new contract,” Amorim said in his press conference when asked about Ratcliffe’s visit.",

      "Bailey said: “They’re happy with what’s happened over the summer – the players brought in, the system he’s implementing — and the main focus is seeing progress on the field.",
      "“And we are already seeing it: they’re a much better team than when he first took over, though admittedly they couldn’t have been much worse.",
      "“The club is backing Amorim. Jason Wilcox has fully bought into his approach, and the squad is being shaped in Amorim’s image. There’s little point in cancelling the experiment now — that would set the club back even further.”",
      "But the report adds that ‘Ratcliffe and his lieutenants are notably unhappy with the number of leaks around players voicing their frustration with Amorim’s system’.",
      "Journalist Ben Jacobs gave an update on Wednesday, from what he’s heard, on Amorim’s future at Man Utd.",
      "He said: “There is certainly appreciation for names like Oliver Glasner, but the sign that Amorim is still being backed is that there has been no outreach yet. There’s been no shortlisting yet. There hasn’t even, to my knowledge, been any succession planning yet.",
      "“Manchester United still want to try and make it work with Ruben Amorim. That’s why he is likely to get a few more games, at least, before some of these other names perhaps come a bit more seriously to the fore if results don’t go according to plan for Amorim.”",
      "What’s the ‘only reason’ Ruben Amorim hasn’t been sacked by Manchester United? And which two Red Devils heroes are poised for a caretaker role?",

      "The United performances this season, featuring an inept Manuel Ugarte and a foolhardy Casemiro over wantaway Kobbie Mainoo in the double pivot with Bruno Fernandes have confirmed a need that seemingly everyone but the Manchester United decision-makers viewed as either priority one, two or three over the summer.",
      "‘Manchester United are ready to lead the way next summer in the race for No 6 midfielders with the key position expected to dominate the transfer market,’ The Telegraph claimed on Wednesday, before revealing later in the report precisely why the Red Devils won’t be leading that race.",
      "The lure of Big Club history may have been enough to persuade Bryan Mbeumo to snub Newcastle for Manchester United, but that will surely prove to be no match against modern-day behemoth Manchester City in the transfer stakes next summer.",
      "It’s claimed ‘Manchester City could look at that position to ease the workload of 2024 Ballon d’Or winner Rodri’ in a possibility we can’t imagine Nico Gonzalez will be too fond of as he works to prove himself as a serviceable backup to his Spanish compatriot.",
      "While reports suggest United will reopen talks with Brighton over Baleba, Nottingham Forest’s Elliot Anderson and Crystal Palace’s Adam Wharton are also on the Red Devils’ shortlist, but in an increasingly unimaginative transfer market in which top clubs chase the same players, placing particular value on homegrown talents like Anderson or Wharton, we can also assume they’re on City’s.",
      "And we wonder whether Liverpool’s likely push for Wharton as a backup for Ryan Gravenberch, having been linked with the Palace midfielder in the summer amid their apparent bid to provide Arne Slot with two brilliant footballers to choose between in every position, may in fact bring about a situation where United have to settle for current top target Baleba.",
      "As Fabian Hurzeler said at the weekend, Baleba is “not a machine” and there is a “responsibility” for Brighton to help him rediscover his form having had his head turned by United to such a degree that he doesn’t look worth the £23.5m the Seagulls paid for him in the summer of 2023, let alone the nine-figure sum they’re now asking for.",
      "A similar trajectory which saw Evan Ferguson fade into anonymity having been linked with a big-money move to United would presumably lead even the hive-minders at Old Trafford to plump for one of the two alternatives, but interest from City and Liverpool in those same players would surely result in United finishing last in a race they’re currently leading.",
      "Brighton midfielder Carlos Baleba should be off the market in January, but a summer exit for Man Utd remains a real possibility, according to Ben Jacobs.",
      "Ben Jacobs says Man Utd-linked midfielder Adam Wharton has a “gentleman’s agreement” with Crystal Palace, meaning he can leave the club next summer.",
      "Man Utd will reportedly push to sign Brighton midfielder Carlos Baleba in January, which surely means Kobbie Mainoo is being pushed out.",
      "Manchester United face a nightmare scenario if/when Liverpool hijack their arch-rivals in the race for a ‘dream’ transfer in 2026…",
      "Liverpool have just broken the British transfer record for an ‘£86m player’ but have their own ideas about Carlos Baleba and Michael Olise.",

      "“When I was a teenager, Manchester United was, along with Real Madrid, the biggest club of all.”",
      "Former Premier League midfielder Danny Murphy recently admitted that he doubts Amorim will last until the end of his contract in 2027 but reckons there has “been some progression” at Man Utd this season.",

There’s been no shortlisting yet. There hasn’t even, to my knowledge, been any succession planning yet.",

      "Send your mails to theeditor@football365.com",

      "I understand why F365 thinks that Scholes has a Marcus Rashford problem.",
      "Because if you haven’t put yourself through each and every rubbish match they have played over the last 4-5 years, and then check that Rashford does play a few games a season quite well, you will wonder why Rashford is being targeted. But as someone who really really liked Marcus Rashford, and has put himself through each and every minute of each and every game since 10-15 years now, let me tell you why Scholes is just saying what every fan feels.",
      "Marcus is a local lad, who burst through and gave United fans hope that this is the next Academy player to be a star. He had great talent, was an amazing human and had the right values. So when he walks around the field for 80% of the match, literally not putting 2 steps to the right to try and defend or even fake defend when United don’t have the ball, and is one of the laziest players I’ve seen to grace the pitch, right up there with Martial and the 40 year old Ronaldo playing for Portugal currently. And while the Ronaldo case is easier to understand and the rest of the team work 10% harder to accommodate him at the age of 40, there is absolutely no reason the rest of the United team should suffer because Marcus cannot be bothered to do a proper job.",
      "On the edge of his own box, with the ball in front of him, he will just walk around and let the opposition players take shots or walk past him with ease. In EACH AND EVERY MATCH. It’s extremely annoying to watch regularly.",
      "Twice or thrice a season, he will put in a performance where he is energetic, runs with and without the ball, and his decision making is on point. But the rest of the time, he is one of the most lazy, infuriating and abysmal players on the pitch. Then comes his off-pitch behavior of being late, going partying, not working with the team agenda in mind, when he was the poster boy for Manchester United, it all mixes together to bring a feeling of sadness and regret at what he could have been and what he has become. The massive wages United gave him play a part in this downfall and for that I blame the management and board.",
      "The only reason I am excited for Rashford scoring or playing well for Barca is so United can scam 30 million pounds off for him, which no one in their right minds would otherwise pay along with his stupid wages. May he excel at Barca and find his peace there. I genuinely wish him well, and unlike Scholes I am happy for him if he finds a home in the beautiful city of Barcelona.\nAman",

      "I don’t think Matt Stead understands how culture is embedded within large organisations or in society at large.",
      "To take Arteta and Arsenal as an example – I’m an Arsenal fan and don’t believe the culture is perfect at Arsenal. However I believe we can agree that Arteta has improved it since he arrived.",
      "Which demonstrates that the manager sets the required culture (standards), the players have to fall in line and if they don’t the manager needs to be backed by senior leaders to enforce the required standards. This starts with disciplining the players and if they continue to misbehave they need to be removed from the team and the club. This has what has clearly happened at Arsenal.",
      "At Utd both Ten Hag and Amorim have set standards. They started by disciplining players (dropping them/fining them) then moved to excluding them and then selling them. This was clearly backed by senior leadership who allowed multi million pound assets to lose value by excluding them from the first team.",
      "Therefore the managers and senior leadership have done their jobs in maintaining culture and standards.",
      "In conclusion what is left are the players that did not uphold Utd’s standards and culture. And although it could be argued that what they are paid is irrelevant, my argument would be that a) employees earning 25k a year are expected to adhere to company standards b) chief executives earning 10m a year are expected to adhere to company standards. Therefore people earning 15m a year certainly should be.",
      "If they don’t, it’s no one else’s fault. And tbh the state this country is in demonstrates that many people no longer feel accountable for their own actions or situations. Footballers are just a microcosm of that.\nRojapy",

      "In the 2024/25 season, Liverpool had two dedicated number 9s (Nunez and Jota) with four other senior players capable of ‘doing a job’ to varying degrees (Chiesa, Diaz, Gakpo and Salah). In 2025/26 this became Isak and Ekitike, and Chiesa, Gakpo and Salah.",
      "There was literally zero prospect of a team trying to go through an entire season with just one recognised striker, so two were always going to be necessary. The fact that one of these unexpectedly turned out to be Isak may have pushed Ekitike from an expected starting role to backup, but doesn’t change the fundamental fact that he was always going to be competing with someone for his place. He was likely made aware of this when he signed.",
      "After a great start to his Liverpool career, getting himself sent off in some of the dumbest circumstances possible will have undoubtedly not helped him retain his starting position over Isak, but that has probably only accelerated the inevitable.",
      "However, with the number of games that Liverpool are likely to play and Isak’s lack of pre-season and slightly patchy injury record, Ekitike will still get plenty of starts and substitute appearances. It therefore seems unlikely that the times he spends on the bench will result in significant surprise or unhappiness on his part despite what the media and certain people BTL would have you believe.\nMatt D, London",

Ekitike was born in 2002, so for his entire football playing life, he’s known he’ll be booked if he does that.",
      "As Hesh points out, it’s a “nonsense” rule given how ultimately harmless the act is, and how unaffected the other team are by it.",
      "However, the act itself is equally as daft as the rule. Maybe it’s just me. I’ve never understood the logical connection between scoring and taking your shirt off. It’s probably the most prominent thing that doesn’t make sense outside of a football context, but even in a football context, it’s something people used to do and I’m not convinced many of them really knew why, beyond it being something lots of other people did at the time.\nEd Quoththeraven",

After the game, the coach of Brighton, Fabian Hurzeler, was very honest. He said that when a young player like Baleba is linked to a team like Man Utd and the deal doesn’t happen, this can have an influence on his performance. It can have an impact.",
      "“Baleba wanted to go to Man Utd. But he’s always been respectful with Brighton. He was keen on the move. Personal terms were never going to be an issue. The problem was only Brighton and Man Utd. Brighton might consider let him go in 2026 but in 2025 it was always a no. That situation effected the player.",

      "Our football betting expert and top tipster Jones Knows provides his insight across the Premier League, sharing his best bets and predictions.",
      "Football loves a storyline and sometimes spotting a potential one can lead to some profitable betting decisions. This fixture has it written all over it. I'm looking straight at the Bryan Mbeumo to score price and getting involved at 2/1 with Sky Bet. It's a selection where football's emotion meets football's logic. A case of the ex.",
      "Football fans have seen it before. A player goes back to his old stomping ground, a place where he was adored, nurtured and given the stage - and what happens? He scores. The emotion of the occasion can lift a player. Add in that little extra point to prove, and suddenly you've got the perfect recipe for a goalscorer bet.",
      "Also, Mbeumo knows Brentford inside-out. He knows the weaknesses, the defensive gaps, the way his opposition full-back will defend. And since joining United, Mbeumo has looked the part too - stretching defences, taking on full-backs, and looking dangerous between the lines. He's averaging a healthy 0.39 expected goals per 90 - a clear sign that chances are falling his way therefore his goal return should see an uptick soon enough.",
      "If you're the kind of punter like me who likes clean sheets, defensive discipline and backing under-goal lines - then this game isn't for you. This clash has got goals written all over it.",
      "Past meetings have at times descended into footballing mayhem. The last six meetings have averaged 4.3 goals per game and who can forget last season's fixture at Stamford Bridge where Brighton's offside trap was exposed brutally by Chelsea and shots were flying in from 30 yards in a 4-2 home win.",
      "Brighton remain the most reliable team in the Premier League for goals. Only one of their last 25 games across all competitions has seen less than two goals scored with the per game total goals average at a fiery 3.64 per game. Expect entertainment and the over 3.5 goal line to give you a great run at 6/4 with Sky Bet.",
      "The lazy narrative will tell you that Liverpool have the title wrapped up already. Results say they're flying - unbeaten in five, late winners. But peel back the scoreboard and ask yourself, are this team that convincing?",
      "For me? No.",
      "This team are getting the job done, yes, but there's a lack of control in games that is leading to fine margins deciding the outcomes. That should ring a few alarm bells. Bournemouth caused them problems. Newcastle ran all over them. Burnley almost stifled them. Everton nearly nabbed them.",
      "Palace can punish them. Oliver Glasner has built a no-nonsense team that are almost perfect in terms of organisation without possession. Since they got beat 5-0 at Newcastle they are unbeaten in 17 competitive games, and they've won two trophies in that time. Across those 17 games they have just conceded nine goals and bagged nine clean sheets. That pure structural discipline can lead them to a result here on the double chance at Evens with Sky Bet.",
      "I think this game sets up very well for a Leeds win here at 2/1 with Sky Bet.",
      "Bournemouth are a fantastic team to bet on as their style never changes and clear, trustworthy patterns are emerging in that when teams allow them the ball, they struggle.",
      "In their last 14 matches where they've averaged 56 per cent or more possession, their record is W4 D3 L7. In that sample size they have been beaten by Brentford twice, Leicester and Ipswich. If Bournemouth can't force you into transitions, they become awkwardly one-paced and predictable in the final third.",
      "And this is how Leeds have been trying to play this season. They are full of physicality and built to play very direct and aggressive football with also being very secure at the back where the excellent Ethan Ampadu leads their defensive organisation.",
      "This will be a game where punters will be twitching their fingers instinctively towards the overs with visions of City with Erling Haaland in the form of his life carving through a low block like a hot knife through butter. But if you scratch beneath the surface, there's a compelling case for going the other way. The under 2.5 goals angle looks best bet of the weekend material at 7/4 with Sky Bet.",
      "Pep Guardiola just might be building a team that dominates through defensive output - and the rock-solid axis of Ruben Dias and Josko Gvardiol is absolutely pivotal to that. They've started 11 games together domestically since the start of April and City won eight of those games with the only defeat being the FA Cup final. Across those 11 games they only conceded five goals, keeping seven clean sheets.",
      "And now if you add Gianluigi Donnarumma and Rodri into that defensive unit, you've got yourself a really domineering and formidable defensive axis, one that could be the backbone of a team that challenges for major honours once again.",
      "Also, of the 50 Premier League games played this season, 25 have fallen under the 2.5 goals line and the overall goals per game average sits at 2.48. That will eventually rise but it's just another bit of evidence to throw in the mix for an unders bet.",
      "Hello, old friend. Nice to see you again. Ange-ball was back and dancing to the tune of some very happy Forest fans in the away end at Real Betis.",
      "Yes, Forest didn't get maximum points but boy were they pulsating for most of that game. Ange Postecoglou has flicked the tactical switch as the new boss and has painted his footballing identity all over these Forest players already which is based around: attack first, ask questions later.",
      "You could see the blueprint Postecoglou built at Celtic and Spurs - overloads in wide areas, full-backs tucking in to build and midfielders darting between lines, something Elliot Anderson absolutely thrived at.",
      "It was fun to watch. And we can declare with confidence that they're going to create chances. Lots of them. And concede lots of chances too.",
      "This new Forest style is going to blow the lid off their goal lines. Forget the side that grinded out 1-0s at home - this is now a team actively embracing risk and one who will become an over 2.5 money-spinner while the prices remain behind the curve. It's Evens here and where Postecoglou is involved, over 2.5 lines simply must be your punting friend.",
      "Vitor Pereira needs to change something. Dating back to last season, Wolves have no win in nine games, taking just one point from the last 27 available. However, he might just have stumbled upon the system that could lead to a change in fortunes. The 4-4-2 he played in the midweek win over Everton made Wolves more compact and - crucially - seemed to help get support into their key striker Jorgen Strand Larsen.",
      "This Wolves side might still be winless but playing Spurs, weirdly, brings out their best. They have amassed nine Premier League wins vs Spurs, the club's joint-most against any opponent and have won four of the last five meetings.",
      "Maybe, the old-school 4-4-2 could be the key to spark Wolves into life against their favourite opponent? They could be worth a swing at 4/1 on the draw no bet with Sky Bet.",
      "Sander Berge to be carded at 3/1 with Sky Bet is simply too big for a player who's being thrust into the midfield furnace against one of the most skilled card-drawing teams in the Premier League.",
      "Aston Villa's engine room of Morgan Rogers and John McGinn - with the occasional Ollie Watkins thrown in from further forward - isn't just technically sharp, it's a card magnet's dream. They rotate positions, carry the ball with purpose and are constantly engaging the opposition.",
      "In Villa's last 14 Premier League games an opposition centre-midfielder has been carded in 12 of those matches with 16 carded in total. Fulham have history of cards in this fixture too, having been shown 20 yellows in the past five meetings, with Berge one of those players cautioned last time.",
      "This is the last fixture Mikel Arteta needs right now.",
      "A trip that's rapidly becoming one of the most emotionally charged and physically demanding fixtures in the Premier League calendar and one where Arsenal have history of succumbing to the atmosphere.",
      "Arsenal are favourites with the markets here at Evens with Sky Bet. But should they be? I'm not having it. Not when Newcastle are in this kind of mood at home as the underdog.",
      "There's something about Newcastle that rattles Arteta's Arsenal. The Gunners have lost four of their last five games in all competitions at St James' Park, including both visits last season. They have failed to score in all four defeats.",
      "Arteta teams love rhythm and structure and the Newcastle midfield don't give you that. They break your passing lanes, slow down your build-up and make it a scrap. They don't just play the occasion, they use it as a weapon. And in front of the Geordie faithful, Newcastle look a savvy bet on the draw no bet market at 6/4 with Sky Bet.",
      "Since swapping the somewhat clockwork football of Pep Guardiola's Manchester City for the freedom given to him at Everton, Jack Grealish looks like Jack Grealish again.",
      "His take-ons per 90 has rocketed from 3.7 per game at City from the past two seasons to 9.1 per 90 in the Everton blue. Grealish's time at City wasn't wasted of course, he won trophies, created history and matured. But he wasn't the maverick that made him box office.",
      "Well, the maverick inside is being unleashed by David Moyes and Grealish is the most creative player in the Premier League as a result. Grealish has four assists, creating 2.9 chances per 90 from open play - no player to have played 200 minutes or more has a higher per-90 figure from that metric. He is 11/4 with Sky Bet to bag another assist in what should be a routine home win.",

      "Barcelona are unlikely to discuss a permanent move for Marcus Rashford until next summer; Barca are delighted with the progress of Rashford, who, despite still having three years left on his current deal Man Utd, remains unlikely to have any future at Old Trafford",
      "By Rob Dorsett and Lyall Thomas",
      "Wednesday 24 September 2025 11:42, UK",
      "Barcelona are pleased with the progress of loanee Marcus Rashford but they remain unlikely to discuss a permanent move for the England international until next summer.",
      "Despite still having three years left on his current deal with Manchester United, Rashford currently looks unlikely to have any future at Old Trafford and is focused on making the best impact he can at Barcelona - a club he has long dreamed of playing for.",
      "Barca are delighted with the progress of Rashford and are said to be very enthusiastic about how he is settling into the club and the city. They are also pleased with how he has already endeared himself to the players, staff and fans at the Nou Camp, despite a reprimand for being two minutes late for a recent meeting by head coach Hansi Flick.",
      "On the pitch, he is also delivering. The 27-year-old has two goals and two assists in his last three games.",
      "It remains far too early for Barcelona to discuss the potential of signing him on a permanent basis - but there is no gap in valuation with Manchester United over what that would cost, contrary to reports earlier this week.",
      "That is because the loan agreement contains an option to buy him for an agreed fee of £26.2m (€30m) and - with his further progress on and off the field and the club's long-term financial parameters still to consider - triggering that option is not something Barcelona are expected to discuss until the end of the campaign.",
      "Also to consider for Barcelona is the long-term future of striker Robert Lewandowski, who turned 37 last month and sees his current deal expire at the end of the season.",
      "Rashford's ability to play as a No 9 may come into the Barca bosses' thinking when they consider whether to extend Lewandowski's deal or look to sign a new permanent centre-forward instead.",
      "Another key issue is Rashford's wages, which Barca are currently covering entirely - making him one of the highest paid players in Spain.",
      "Barca have had to pull financial levers elsewhere in the club in order to register new signings in recent seasons, so paying the permanent option fee and continuing to pay his salary demands is something that will have to come into their long-term financial planning and be subject to LaLiga's spending cap.",
      "Rashford said last week that he wants to play for Barca for \"as many [seasons] as possible\" and \"we will see\" when it comes to a permanent move. \"I have to focus on trying to do my job and trying to help the team in whichever way I can,\" he added.",
      "It will depend on how Rashford performs for the full course of the season, although he has already made a big impact with his two goals against Newcastle in the Champions League and an assist in the thrashing of Valencia.",
      "He is also yet to feel the full support of the Nou Camp because of delays to ongoing refurbishment work at the stadium.",
      "Flick's reprimand for him being late, which was being dropped to the bench, is standard fare under the German's rules and considered water-under-the-bridge at the club. The likes of Raphinha have also had the same treatment for slack punctuality.",

      "Fernandes showed that he can get into goalscoring positions when playing in a two-man midfield. He grabbed the opening goal, his 100th in United colours, that got the ball rolling against Chelsea. That put everyone at ease and opened the game up.",
      "Amorim is undoubtedly asking a lot of his captain to dictate the game from deep and deliver a threat in the final third, but on Saturday Fernandes rose to the occasion. \"The point of the captain is to be the best he can be in every situation to make the team better,\" added Amorim.",
      "Even when United were wobbling in the closing stages, Fernandes single-handedly led his team up the pitch after dispossessing Reece James and very nearly scored a stunning strike from range before firing up the Stretford End.",
      "Who could Man Utd have signed this summer that would deliver all of this straight away? Many of Amorim's decisions have rightly been questioned but keeping Fernandes was no doubt the right call.Zinny Boswell",
      "Trevoh Chalobah's header briefly gave Chelsea hope at Old Trafford but the one-goal margin of defeat flattered them. Despite Casemiro's red card levelling the playing field before half-time, they only managed five shots worth a meagre 0.39 expected goals.",
      "Their listless performance capped a poor week after drawing with Brentford and losing their Champions League opener to Bayern Munich. It also raised questions of their head coach Enzo Maresca, whose decisions during the game did little to help his side.",
      "First came his call to substitute Pedro Neto as well as Estevao after Robert Sanchez's early red card, leaving Chelsea devoid of any kind of quick outlet. Not long after that, he withdrew Cole Palmer, later explaining he was not fully fit before the game.",
      "Starting a half-fit Palmer only three days after he played 90 minutes in Munich was never likely to end well and his removal, for the more defensively-minded Andrey Santos, further limited his side offensively when they were chasing the game.",
      "Maresca could have called on Alejandro Garnacho, who would surely have been desperate to prove a point against his former side, or the £51.5m Jamie Gittens, but both players finished the game as unused substitutes, with Tyrique George, a player they seemed happy to sell a month ago, preferred in the second half. It was another strange decision from the Chelsea boss in a game full of them.Nick Wright",
      "Graham Potter is a hard man to read. Perhaps he is a better poker player than football manager in that regard.",
      "As he strode into his post-match press conference to address a room of journalists ready to poke and probe him on his West Ham future, you would not have been able to tell if his team had won 6-0 or lost 2-1. His emotionless responses were as predictable as the West Ham defeat.",
      "Remember, football is supposed to be an emotional game, played by emotional people, managed in the most emotionally volatile environments. And that is where Potter keeps falling short.",
      "There is no doubting his coaching credentials. His work at Ostersunds, Brighton and even in patches at Chelsea paints the picture of a tactician who understands the game at a deep level and he is well admired within coaching circles.",
      "His problem is that lack of personality. It is going to hold him back from ever making a success of himself at a big club. It is unlikely now he will get that chance again as his stock continues to fall.Lewis Jones",
      "Last season, this Spurs side embarrassingly collapsed at Brighton, but nearly a year on, they showed real fight to rescue a draw as they appear far more resilient under Thomas Frank.",
      "Having gone 2-0 down after 31 minutes on Saturday, Spurs looked set to suffer their first away defeat under the Dane, but there is a steeliness about this Tottenham side that was not always evident under Ange Postecoglou.",
      "Last October, Spurs went 2-0 up after 37 minutes, but a shocking second-half surrender saw Brighton win 3-2 with Postecoglou labelling it then as his \"worst defeat\" of his tenure.",
      "For Frank, the same venue has provided the opposite feeling as he called the 2-2 draw their \"best performance of the season\".",
      "He had a point with Spurs looking far more threatening than in their midweek Champions League home win over Villarreal.",
      "Frank was also delighted with their \"mentality\" and \"physicality\" in their comeback over Brighton - something they are going to need plenty of with a potential 50-plus game season in store.",
      "Eyebrows were slightly raised when £51m signing Xavi Simons started on the bench, but he came on to great effect in the No 10 role, where surely he will have a much better impact than out on the left-wing.",
      "Another bright spot was left-back Destiny Udogie, whom Frank hailed \"exceptional\" and \"unstoppable\" on his first start of the season.",
      "Udogie was a part of that Spurs side which crumbled on the south coast last season, but in this rescue act he was one to display Frank's pursuit of a tougher and determined Spurs.Declan Olley",
      "After such a dour Fulham performance against Leeds last weekend, it was curious that Marco Silva chose not to pick any of the substitutes - let's be honest, Kevin, who spurred them to victory late on in that game - to start against Brentford.",
      "Maybe that is why he is the Premier League head coach, because after a week of seeing his side on the training ground he was absolutely right to keep faith that they would find their energy and creativity again.",
      "He said this week their ambitions would not be dimmed by a difficult transfer window, with only Aston Villa spending less, but resources do make a difference.",
      "This was a timely reminder of the talent that remains at Craven Cottage, and that was without their tricky new Brazilian, or fellow new arrival Samuel Chukwueze who was an unused substitute.",
      "Special credit to Josh King, who was unusually quiet in his last game and gave away Brentford's opener in this one, but went on to drive the hosts forward before he was withdrawn.",
      "Silva said he was \"impressed, but not surprised\" by the 18-year-old's maturity, and the way he refused to hide despite such an unfortunate error was a credit to the teenager.",
      "Little surprise he was handed a standing ovation when he eventually made way for the Brazilian. It almost warrants a double take that this was just his 20th senior appearance.Ron Walker",
      "Wolves have always been slow starters. They have lost nine out of their last 10 matches and they have conceded a double-digit goal tally in each of the last three seasons. But this feels different - and not in a good way.",
      "Wolves look sloppy at both ends of the pitch. Only West Ham have conceded more goals than them while they have a Premier League-high of errors leading to goals this season.",
      "Meanwhile, their attacking credentials were summed up on Saturday by having three times more of expected goals than Leeds, who in turn managed three times more actual goals than them.",
      "Losing Nelson Semedo, Rayan Ait-Nouri, Pablo Sarabia and Matheus Cunha in one summer would cause that. Wolves are not just missing the quality the quartet bring, but also the experience of these situations.",
      "Wolves also appear to have tied their own hands in tying Vitor Pereira down to a new deal this week. It makes a change of direction much harder, as pulling the plug on Pereira would then create further questions about the club's decision makers.",
      "So Wolves are not just slow starters, they are stuck and standing still.Sam Blitz",
      "Three summer signings got on the scoresheet for Leeds at Wolves and all stole the show in their different ways.",
      "Dominic Calvert-Lewin's first Premier League goal since January was a throwback to his best self - not only grabbing Leeds' equaliser but leading the line with solid build-up play.",
      "Anton Stach's brilliant free-kick was the moment of the match. The German midfielder came into the weekend as the only Premier League player with at least 10 shots and 10 chances created - and he will join Calvert-Lewin in producing attacking creativity to make Daniel Farke's side dangerous.",
      "But the standout player was Noah Okafor, whose third goal was so well deserved after an industrious performance down the left.",
      "The winger attempted an incredible 14 dribbles - 12 of them coming before half-time. That dozen was already the most out of any Premier League player in a single match all season, and his aggressive and clinical display epitomised their overall display.",
      "A lot of Leeds' summer signings had one thing in common: six foot or above. Farke even admitted they had been brought in with physicality and even set-pieces in mind.",
      "But Leeds have showed something different: they have actual Premier League quality capable of keeping them up.Sam Blitz",
      "Ange Postecoglou says Nottingham Forest are \"responding\" to what he wants them to do, despite his side being winless since he replaced Nuno Espirito Santo.",
      "The worrying thing for him is that Forest are beginning to inherit some good things from Postcoglou but they are also taking on his downsides.",
      "Postecoglou is winless in his last nine Premier League games and that stretches back into the latter days at Tottenham. It is his longest run without a league win as a top-flight manager across spells in Australia, Japan, Scotland and England.",
      "Forest started strongly and quickly, which earned them a much-deserved second-minute opener. The intensity was there. But the almost kamikaze nature of their play allowed Burnley back into the game, ceding control with Scott Parker's side looking the more likely. Burnley's equaliser in the 20th minute was a deserved one, and their display from that point merited at least one more with the chances they created.",
      "It is those periods that Postecoglou failed to manage during his Spurs days and similar patterns are emerging. Postecoglou needs to buck that trend if he is to find any success at the City Ground.William Bitibiri",
      "In a Premier League where we obsess with big names, big budgets and big personalities, Oliver Glasner is crafting something special - something clever - at Crystal Palace.",
      "He is one that embraces the marginal gains. If there is one manager in the Premier League who embodies that philosophy to the letter, it is Glasner.",
      "The win at West Ham was the perfect case in point where Palace exposed West Ham's fragilities at set-pieces. Glasner's team scored one and created two other big chances from such scenarios and he was very open in his post-match presser about how he knew he could expose a psychological weakness in the West Ham ranks.",
      "He said: \"I played over 19 years as a defender and you have periods sometimes where you can concede many set-piece goals. This makes you nervous. It's natural, we're all human beings and even if you don't want it to be there, this just happens. We talked about it. It was good to have many set-plays.\"",
      "Glasner is such a smart cookie.Lewis Jones",

      "Match report and free match highlights as Bruno Fernandes and Casemiro's first-half goals were enough to see Man Utd past Chelsea; Casemiro's second yellow levelled the playing field after early sending off for Robert Sanchez and set up nervy ending after Trevoh Chalobah pulled a goal back",
      "Sunday 21 September 2025 07:20, UK",
      "Manchester United eased the pressure on head coach Ruben Amorim as they held on to beat Chelsea 2-1 in a frantic encounter which saw both sides down to 10 men.",
      "United made a blistering start and caught Chelsea cold in the pouring Old Trafford rain as Robert Sanchez was sent off after five minutes for chopping down Bryan Mbeumo. Goals from Bruno Fernandes and Casemiro then put United firmly in control heading into the break.",
      "However, Casemiro had levelled the playing field when he was shown a second yellow for bringing down Andrey Santos in first-half stoppage-time. Chelsea pulled a late goal back through Trevoh Chalobah but failed to truly take advantage of the opening to extend their nearly 13-year winless run at Old Trafford.",
      "United threatened to collapse but pulled through to secure Amorim's first back-to-back Premier League home wins since taking charge. The second-half performance was unconvincing, but the three points will create some breathing space for now.",
      "Man Utd:  Bayindir (6); De Ligt (7), Maguire (7), Shaw (7); Mazraoui (7), Casemiro (6), Fernandes (8), Dorgu (7); Mbeumo (8), Sesko (6), Amad (7).\n\n\nSubs:  Ugarte (6), Cunha (6), Mount (6) Yoro (6), Mainoo (N/A).\n\n\nChelsea:  Sanchez (1); James (5), Fofana (4), Chalobah (6), Cucurella (5); Fernandez (5), Caicedo (6), Palmer (4); Neto (4), Joao Pedro (6), Estevao (4).\n\n\nSubs:  Jorgensen (6), Tosin (5), Andrey Santos (6), Gusto (5), George (5). \n\n\nPlayer of the Match:  Bruno Fernandes (Man Utd).",
      "Amorim asked for more aggression this week and his players responded emphatically as they overawed Chelsea in the first half. Sanchez's red was the earliest Chelsea had ever had a player sent off and it told. They were shellshocked.",
      "It was the captain Fernandes who eventually got the ball rolling for United with his 100th goal for the club in his 200th Premier League appearance.",
      "After all the debate around Fernandes' position in Amorim's system and whether it gives him enough license to get forward, the midfielder poked in a poacher's finish to open the scoring after Patrick Dorgu's header across goal.",
      "Chelsea were all at sea by then and Enzo Maresca took evasive action to try and prevent the slide after Sanchez's red card, making three substitutions with just 21 minutes on the clock, the earliest a manager has ever done so in the Premier League.",
      "Cole Palmer was a surprise sacrifice for Chelsea, but it later became apparent that the groin issue he had supposedly shaken off after defeat at Bayern Munich on Wednesday in the Champions League was still bothering him.",
      "Casemiro doubled United's lead toward the end of the half thanks to a botched clearance from Reece James that allowed Luke Shaw to overpower Wesley Fofana and head the ball to the back post for the Brazilian to nod in.",
      "His inexplicable decision to pull down Andrey Santos less than 10 minutes later opened the door for Chelsea. Casemiro shook his head after being shown red, as if he had been hard done by, but he should never have given Peter Bankes a decision to make with the game all but won.",
      "Chelsea did not register a single shot on target until Chalobah headed in at the back post from James' cross with 10 minutes to go. United had gone into their shells, fearing a late comeback, but there was not enough conviction from the visitors to capitalise on the wobble.",
      "Alejandro Garnacho did not get the Old Trafford return he would have hoped for as he was booed by the home fans and denied the opportunity to enter the fray by a late injury to Fofana which used up Chelsea's final substitution.",
      "Maresca's side return to west London after a sobering week: a draw at Brentford followed by defeats in Munich and Manchester. Chelsea are just one point ahead of United in the table after five games.",
      "\"Every three points is massive in this moment because we haven't started the season as we wanted. But we go game by game. Today was massive and the next one will be massive too.",
      "\"Every goal is important. It doesn't matter the moment. A big moment for me, reaching that milestone for a massive club. I'm very happy, I won't hide from that, but it wasn't something I was trying to achieve when I came to the club. It was about trying to do the best I could and obviously if I can get more goals to help the team win games, that is what matters the most.",
      "\"We were more sit back, try not to concede goals, not let them play through the lines as they have a lot of players who like to drop to play. It was about pushing them to the sides to cross the ball, as we had big players. We still conceded the goal from the corner, but we defended very well. We got the result we wanted in the end.\"",
      "\"This is Amorim's biggest result as Manchester United manager, certainly at home. This was huge for him today. It got edgy once Casemiro got sent off, you weren't sure they were going to be able to see it out.",
      "\"But Bruno Fernandes was magnificent, second half especially. He carried the fight. It feels like a big occasion but they've got to build on it. They've got to go and win two, three, four games.",
      "\"It was a mad game, I have to be honest. Some of the substitutions, some of the tactical changes. It was hard to keep up with at times. But it was a joy because it was so chaotic.\"",
      "\"Really good. Now it's time to create a bit of momentum. We started the game really well, really aggressive. I cannot remember a very good play from us, but we pushed our opponent in how aggressive we were in the first and second balls. We cannot have someone sent off near half-time in Casemiro, we like to complicate all our games! But it was a good game.",
      "\"I felt the urgency, especially in the beginning of the game. The sending off helped us. If you remember the first half, we had so many opportunities three against one, three against two. We have to be more clinical to finish the game sooner. With the sending off of Casemiro, you never know what is going to happen so we have to take the chance to kill the game.\"",
      "\"Very difficult because after three or four minutes with the red card, it completely changed the game. All the plan is in the bin. So it was very complicated.",
      "\"[Sanchez's red card is] a situation that we can avoid because we knew these kind of long balls for Benjamin Sesko, they try to flick for Mbeumo. We knew that. Unfortunately we conceded that moment. When you are one player down, it becomes completely difficult and changed the game.\"",
      "Explaining his decision to make three changes after the red card, Maresca added: \"They are used to attacking with five players, so in that moment we have to defend with five players. We can defend absolutely with four when we are 11 vs 11, but when we are one player down, the idea was to defend with five.",
      "\"We decided to change with Estevao and Pedro Neto and the after we changed Cole because he made an effort to play this game because he was not 100 per cent fit. This morning he had a test and he was OK but not 100 per cent fit. So we decided to change him after 20 minutes.\"",
      "\"We have to look at ourselves as players. It wasn't good enough for ourselves, for the club. The first 15 minutes is the worst we've played this season. We have to reflect on that as a team and learn from this.",
      "\"With the red card that happens, you go 2-0 down in the game, any team you play against, it's always difficult coming back. We struggled in the first half.",
      "\"It's always difficult going down to 10 men and you can see that United were up for it. They put us under pressure. It wasn't good enough at our end. We couldn't get going in the first half.",
      "\"Things like this happen in the season. We can't say we're kids anymore, we've played in the Premier League long enough now. We have just got to learn from this and move forward.",
