      "Liverpool manager Arne Slot is making up for lost time this summer after opening the transfer floodgates at Anfield. And it has taken the Dutchman just a few weeks to break the rule predecessor Jurgen Klopp sought to adhere to above all others in the market.",
      "Klopp, 58, previously made a point of stressing his morals when it came to keeping Liverpool financially solvent. And that meant not necessarily spending on a par with the likes of Manchester City and Manchester United, who copped criticism from the former Reds boss for their free-spending ways in the past.",
      "Of course that changed over time as Liverpool made allowances in opening their chequebook so Klopp could compete. But the German was staunchly against spending £100million fees on individuals when he first arrived at Anfield – a line Liverpool have now crossed with the blockbuster signing of Florian Wirtz from Bayer Leverkusen in a British record deal worth up to £116m, with £100m of that being guaranteed.",
      "\"If you bring one player in for £100m or whatever and he gets injured then it all goes through the chimney,\" Klopp warned back in 2016 after United forked out £89m to re-sign Paul Pogba from Juventus. \"The day that this is football, I’m not in a job any more, because the game is about playing together.",
      "\"That is why somebody invented passes so these players can play together. It’s not about running with the ball because you can do it all the time. Building the group is not my unique idea – it is necessary to be successful in football.",
      "\"Other clubs can go out and spend more money and collect top players, yes. Do I have to do it differently to that? I don’t know exactly how much money we could spend because nobody has told me up to this point, ‘No, no, no you can’t do this.’",
      "\"If I spend money it is because I am trying to build a real team. You can win championships, you can win titles. But maybe there is a manner in which you want it. It is about how it is.\"",
      "The Merseysiders have added 22-year-old Wirtz to their armoury and could have to shell out as much as £116m if certain conditions are met. And that addition means Liverpool have now spent more money in this window than any other in their history to date.",
      "Slot recruited Jeremie Frimpong (also from Leverkusen) for £29.5m earlier in the summer, while goalkeeper Giorgi Mamardashvili has joined from Valencia for an initial £25m, along with £4m in add-ons – with that deal agreed last summer counting towards their 2025 spending. Not only that, but a £40m move for Bournemouth left-back Milos Kerkez is also in the pipeline.",
      "Provided the Kerkez deal goes through as expected, that would take Liverpool's total spend this summer to roughly £215m (providing all bonus clauses are met). And despite the fact the transfer window has been open for less than one month, that would far eclipse the previous record for total spend in any other window.",
      "The closest Klopp came to matching that sum was in the summer of 2018 when he spent around £170m on new signings. That included Alisson from Roma (£65m), Naby Keita from RB Leipzig (£53m), Fabinho from Monaco (£39m) and Xherdan Shaqiri from Stoke (£13.5m), though the investments paid off as they won the Champions League that season.",
      "Eventually, Klopp wasn't too far from overseeing a couple of nine-digit deals himself, considering Liverpool signed Virgil van DIjk and Darwin Nunez for £75m and £85m, respectively. Van Dijk became the most expensive defender in football history at the time of his move from Southampton, and Klopp later walked back his comments concerning exorbitant transfer fees.",
      "\"These kind of things happen. When you want to sign a striker as exciting as Darwin is, that’s the market and you have to pay the price,\" he conceded in 2023. \"I said so many things in my life and life caught me then later and showed me that my imagination was obviously not clear enough for how quickly life can change. That’s how it is.",
      "\"After that [comment about Pogba], we bought a centre-half for quite a decent fee [£75m for Van Dijk], we bought a goalie for quite a decent fee [Alisson]. Our situation is always the same, we try to level it somehow [with sales], the things we invest in the boys and in the players we sell, it’s kind of that it’s not going out of any kind of range and that worked so far, but I know, I heard it immediately.\"",
      "To Slot's credit, he won the Premier League in his debut campaign despite barely spending at all last summer. It's only fair that one, therefore, takes into account that spread of cost, which brings his net spend to a more modest £100m or so per summer window so far."

      "Ruben Amorim is 'growing impatient' for new signings ahead of the club's pre-season tour of the Untied States with just Matheus Cunha through the door.",

      "Messi gave a timely reminder of his genius on Thursday, giving Miami their first win the Club World Cup with a breathtaking free-kick against FC Porto.",
      "Afterwards, he discussed his long-term adversary Ronaldo, claiming that they are not actually friends. However, he explained that's only the case as the pair barely get a chance to cross paths.",
      "\"I have a lot of respect and admiration for Cristiano Ronaldo and for the career he's had and continues to have, because he's still competing at the highest level,\" Messi told DSports.",
      "\"The competition with him was on the pitch. Each of us wanted to do the best for our team. Obviously, as always, everything stayed on the field. Off the pitch, we are two normal people. We're not friends obviously because we don't spend time together, but we've always treated each other with a lot of respect.\"",
      "His comments echo his take on the relationship that he made eight years ago. Messi told Spanish outlet Marca in 2017: \"I don't know if we will be [friends]. Friendship is built through spending time together and getting to know each other.",
      "\"We have no relationship, mainly because we only see each other at awards ceremonies and that's the only time we speak. Everything is fine, but our lives don't cross over very often.\"",
      "Does Ronaldo feel the same way? In an interview with Spanish outlet El Chiringuito earlier this year, the ex-Manchester United star claimed he is on good terms with the Miami star due their 'healthy' rivalry – although he has distanced himself from having a friendship with Messi in the recent past.",
      "\"I have a good relationship with Leo Messi,\" said Ronaldo this year. \"I was translating him in English at an award ceremony too! It was funny. It was a healthy rivalry, we got along.\"",
      "However, speaking in 2023, Ronaldo explained: \"I don't see things like that [as a rivalry], the rivalry is gone. It was good, spectators liked it.",
      "\"Those who like Cristiano Ronaldo don't have to hate Messi and vice versa. He's followed his path, and I have followed mine, regardless of playing outside of Europe.",
      "\"The legacy lives on, but I don't see the rivalry like that. We shared the stage many times, it was 15 years. I'm not saying we're friends, I've never had dinner with him, but we're professional colleagues and we respect each other.\"",
      "While the constant debate of just who is the better player, as well as their La Liga battles, have spurred on the question of whether the two are friends - there is another point of contention between the pair: the Ballon d'Or.",
      "Messi has been crowned the winner of the prestigious award eight times, while Ronaldo is his closest challenger on five, which has caused some friction. Yet it seems the iconic duo, while not likely to be spotted dining together any time soon, have put their famous rivalry to one side, for now."

The Catalan giants have an interest in Rashford but are currently attempting to thrash out a deal for Athletic Bilbao’s Nico Williams which will stretch their finances.",
      "A loan move now looks to be the only route out of Old Trafford for Rashford this summer. And he will hope to get his future sorted soon after Ruben Amorim made his feelings about a reintegration into the squad very clear.",
      "The United boss banished the forward alongside three colleagues from the club’s pre-season tour alongside Antony, Alejando Garnacho and Jadon Sancho. Explaining Rashford’s initial omission back in February, Amorim said: \"What I say is I couldn't put Marcus to see the way you're supposed to play football and to train the way I see it.",

And since then, there has practically been silence from North London, with Arsenal’s pursuit being put on ice amid interest in alternative forward Benjamin Sesko.",
      "The same cannot be said of Gyokeres' camp and Sporting Lisbon, however. The striker reportedly threatened to go on strike to force through an exit after believing that Sporting had changed the terms of his departure, while he also turned down clear-the-air talks with his current employers.",
      "But it now appears that Gyokers’ agent would be willing to leak private talks with ex-Sporting and current Man City chief Hugo Viana to facilitate an exit. According to Portuguese outlet Record, Gyokores' agent Hasan Çetinkaya has evidence that backs up his side of the story.",
      "He reportedly has a voice note from Viana agreeing to sell the striker for €60m plus €10m in add-ons (£51m plus £8.5m), following a meeting that was held on September 19 last year. Sporting president Federico Varandas has already given his take on the talks between Viana, Gyokeres and Cetinkaya.",

That Sporting would not demand a release clause now. For one reason: he was going to be 27 years old and no player leaves Portugal at 27 for 100 or 90 million euros.",
      "\"In that same meeting, the agent wanted to anchor the exit to a value. I said this sentence: 'It's not worth us setting a value because I don't know what will happen in a year's time. I don't know if it will be 40, 60 or 80. What I can guarantee is that I will not demand 100 million euros. From then on, I never spoke to the agent again, I never spoke to the player about departures or values.",

Fantastic performance. Certainly one of the best players to have ever stepped onto Portuguese turf. And Sporting will not demand the clause.",
      "\"Now blackmail and insults, Sporting will not accept. One thing is certain: Sporting will not accept 60 million plus 10. As of today, Sporting has not received any proposal for Gyokeres.\"",

      "“It will be a really tough decision for Mbeumo,” Sharpe told Aceodds.com. “To go to Tottenham, playing in the Champions League with the manager you have been playing under and trusts you, knows your game and personality which makes the transition a lot easier.",

      "“He just doesn't seem to be able to do in the Premier League and the pace the league is at. I think he's quick enough, but I don’t know if likes dealing with the physicality. He can go past people like they're not even there and at times he just seems to take the easy option and pass it square.",
      "“With his ability, he should be taking players on at every opportunity and I don’t think he does it enough. He’s unbelievably talented but doesn’t do it enough. Maybe Germany suits him more, where teams don’t sit in as much and he has more time and space to beat players.”",

      "The biggest transfer of the summer is complete. Liverpool have agreed a British record deal with Bayer Leverkusen for Florian Wirtz - which will exceed £110m.",
      "The player completed his medical on Friday and was confirmed as Liverpool's newest signing at 7pm on Saturday. And the Reds already have their next deal in mind.",
      "They have come to an agreement for Bournemouth's Milos Kerkez, with the Cherries set to receive around £40m. Oh, the Reds are also interested in Crystal Palace star Marc Guehi.",
      "Arsenal continue to work on a deal for a new striker as speculation over Benjamin Sesko and Viktor Gyokeres continues. Confirmation of Martin Zubimendi's move to the Emirates is also expected soon.",
      "The Gunners are also in the market for a new winger and have been linked with several options, including Chelsea's Noni Madueke.",
      "Manchester United meanwhile are also in the market for a forward, but also looking to facilitate exits. Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho, Antony and Alejandro Garnacho all require new clubs.",
      "Keep up to date with all of the day's transfer news below...",
      "According to the Guardian, Manchester City are open to letting Ilkay Gundogan leave the club this summer.",
      "The report states that Galatasaray enquired about the veteran midfielder in the January transfer window, but City were unwilling to let him leave then. However, their position has changed with Rodri now fit and Tijjani Reijnders joining from AC Milan earlier this month.",
      "Gundogan does still have a year left on his contract, but City could allow him depart on a free transfer and Galatasaray are said to still be interested in the 34-year-old.",
      "Sancho is expected to leave Manchester United this summer after spending last season out on loan at Chelsea and both Juventus and Napoli are interested in the winger. The report states that United are willing to sell Sancho for around £25m.",
      "Liverpool midfielder Harvey Elliott is set to be subject of a £40m bid from Brighton this summer, per reports. The ex-Fulham star has admitted his future is uncertain as he looks for more playing time, and is currently representing England in the European under-21 Championships.",
      "‌Elliott is said to be the Seagulls' key summer target, and James Milner's presence on the south coast could yet prove persuasive. It has been claimed Elliott turned down a move to Nottingham Forest due to concerns over the club's style of play but the 22-year-old has no such reservations about Brighton.",
      "Slot is reported to be unlikely to stand in Elliott's way over a move and is said to be undecided on the midfielder who made 45 appearances last term but struggled to earn starts.",
      "If anyone was in doubt over Arne Slot's impact at Liverpool, it is greater than simply instructions on the pitch. Florian Wirtz has revealed the Dutchman played a key role in persuading him that Anfield was the correct destination for his future.",
      "“The conversations were always really good,” said Wirtz. “I can remember the first time [we met] he already showed me some scenes and how he wants to play, how I could fit in the team.",
      "“He was just telling me I’m a player he really wants to have in his team and I can bring the team a step forward, and I could just imagine it would be good to be in the team and to make it better. I have to make my performances every week but I’m here for this.”",
      "Ruben Amorim is 'growing impatient' for new signings ahead of the club's pre-season tour of the Untied States with just Matheus Cunha through the door.",
      "The Red Devils are working to sign Bryan Mbeumo and also want a new striker with Eintracht Frankfurt's Hugo Ekitike and Viktor Gyokeres on their wishlist.",
      "But Amorim wants more progress to be made on the transfer front before his team jet out Stateside to compete in the Premier League Summer Series.",
      "Bournemouth defender Milos Kerkez is set to begin his Liverpool medical on Tuesday, after the Reds agreed a £40m deal with the Cherries. The full-back, 21, has long been linked with making the move to join his international team-mate Dominik Szoboszlai, and now it looks set to happen.",
      "Weeks of negotiating have seen Liverpool get another deal over the line and personal terms are already agreed for the Hungary international. It marks the second time Richard Hughes has brokered a deal for Kerkez after he helped seal the deal when Bournemouth signed him from AZ for around £15.5m.",
      "Nottingham Forest manager Nuno Espirito Santo has signed a new three-year contract to remain at the City Ground until at least 2028.",
      "The 51-year-old guided Forest to a seventh-place finish in the Premier League last season, securing European qualification for the first time since the 1995-96 season.",
      "For much of the campaign, it looked as though Forest were going to qualify for the Champions League, but they lost five of their last eight games.",
      "However, that has not prevented owner Evangelos Marinakis from rewarding Nuno following the club’s highest league finish for 30 years, while they also reached the semi-finals of the FA Cup before losing to Manchester City.",
      "Nuno said: “I am delighted to be able to continue our journey at this fantastic football club.",
      "“Since we arrived at Forest, we have worked extremely hard to create a special bond between the players, the fans and everyone at the Club, which helped us achieve great things last season.",
      "“I would like to thank our owner, Mr Marinakis, for his constant support and backing. It is important to me to share a strong relationship with our ownership and we have thoroughly enjoyed working together ever since I arrived at Forest.",
      "“Now is the time to work harder than ever as we strive for more special memories together.”",
      "All parties believe that it's a 'certainty' that Alexander Isak will remain with Newcastle this summer despite interest in the Sweden international's services from Arsenal and Liverpool.",
      "Both Arsenal and newly minted Premier League champions are in the market for a new No.9 this summer and Isak - the top-flight's second highest scorer last term with 23 goals - is a signing both clubs would love to make.",
      "However, Newcastle are in a position of strength after qualifying for the Champions League and, as per The Telegraph, it's expected they will keep hold of their star striker this summer.",
      "Manchester United are said to have 'offered' Real Madrid the chance to sign Marcus Rashford for £40million this summer - but the Spanish giants are unlikely to take them up on the offer.",
      "Rashford is surplus to requirements at Old Trafford and wanted to seal a dream move to Barcelona. But with the Spanish champions advancing in their pursuit of Nico Williams, a move to the Nou Camp would appear to be off the cards.",
      "According to DefensaCentral, United have already offered Real the chance to step in and take Rashford to Spain amid their search for a striker. The report notes, though, that Real have already concluded that he is not the right profile for what they are seeking.",
      "Darwin Nunez has given his approval on a move to Napoli, according to reports in Italy.",
      "Sky Sport Italy claim the Serie A champions Napoli have started talks to sign Nunez and the Uruguay international, 25, has ‘already given the ok’. But Liverpool's demands could yet prove problematic.",
      "The Reds have set a £59.8m asking price and want £55.6m of that to be paid up front.",
      "Right that's all for tonight everyone.",
      "We'll see you back here tomorrow.",
      "Cheers.",
      "Brentford midfielder Christian Norgaard could attract the interest of Arsenal this transfer window. The 31-year-old has two years left on his contract with the Bees, having signed a new deal earlier this year.",
      "But he is among the midfield targets the Gunners could consider moving for this summer as they seek to bolster the middle of the park.",
      "Arsenal are reported to be in competition to sign French midfielder Lucien Agoume. The Sevilla ace is contracted through until 2028 but has been scouted several times by Arsenal over the last 12 months.",
      "Agoume is said to be available for £20m and could be seen as a Thomas Partey replacement.",
      "According to Spanish media reports, Real Madrid are considering a £40m bid for Crystal Palace ace Adam Wharton",
      "The 21-year-old has a contract until 2029 and it doesn't sound like Los Blancos know who they're going to negotiate with if they are keen...",
      "Liverpool are not messing around this summer and could have two more transfers wrapped up in days.",
      "It's a busy one for the Reds with no time to slow down even after making a record deal...",
      "Juventus striker Dusan Vlahovic has rejected the chance to join Jose Mourinho at Fenerbahce, according to Gazzetta dello Sport.",
      "Vlahovic has long been linked with a Juventus exit and now only has one year to run on his contract. But the Serbian is not willing to simply accept any more and wants to wait for what he deems to be a top club.",
      "The Germany international was ready for a new adventure and wants to win the Premier League. Check out what he said in his first words as a Liverpool player.",
      "Bournemouth are holding out for £60m (€70m) for Illia Zabarnyi. PSG have already seen two bids rejected but the defender is keen on the move and parties are edging towards agreement.",
      "It is also understand Milos Kerkez is set for his Liverpool medical on Tuesday and will become the fifth most-expensive LB ever at £40m.",
      "There we go! The biggest transfer of the summer has been confirmed by Liverpool and Florian Wirtz can now go and enjoy his Friday night in some stunning weather.",
      "Arsenal's confirmation of signing Martin Zubimendi is coming ever closer, but it's just the start of a busy summer for sporting director Andrea Berta, writes John Cross.",
      "And he'll be under pressure to land Arsenal's next two priorities.",
      "May Manchester United need a new goalkeeper this summer? Monaco are interested in securing a deal for Andre Onana and the goalkeeper has already provided a cryptic response on his future.",
      "Kenan Yildiz has spoken oout about his position at Juventus. The Turkey star has been touted as a potential alternative to Nico Williams, who looks set to join Barcelona, for Arsenal.",
      "The 20-year-old impressed last season in Italy, scoring 10 goals and providing six assists. But the attacker was often used from the bench.",
      "That has not worked in Arsenal's favour with the forward seemingly content at the club.",
      "“I play where the coach wants. I’m happy at the moment,” he told La Stampa. Juventus are reportedly preparing a new contract offer.",
      "Manchester United have been told that signing Emiliano Martinez could trigger a swathe of new arrivals. There is hope bringing in a player of Martinez's quality would encourage others to follow.",
      "Juventus have not yet given up hope on landing Viktor Gyokeres, despite Arsenal being the forward's preference. The Gunners have been in talks with the Swede but are more advanced over a move for Benjamin Sesko.",
      "Juve have put in a call in a bid to figure out Gyokeres' situation, amid talk of a voice note set to be leaked over the fee he is available for.",
      "Valencia have stepped up their interest in Hull City's Steven Alzate.",
      "The 26-year-old midfielder signed for the Tigers on a free transfer last September and made 28 appearances in total last season.",
      "But the former Brighton and Hove Albion man is the subject of transfer interest elsewhere and Valencia have now pitched a move to Alzate which would see him head to Spain.",
      "Sheffield United are also admirers of Alzate, too, and were linked with the playmaker last summer. The versatile Colombian played regularly under new Blades boss Ruben Selles during his brief stint at Hull.",
      "Alzate still has one year on his deal plus a 12 month club option. The Tigers are open to cashing in for the right price to fund further signings.",
      "Jadon Sancho would be happy to complete a transfer to Italy, amid interest from Napoli.",
      "The Serie A champions and Juventus are said to be interested in his signature, while his agent has fielded calls from Germany over his future.",
      "After selling Dean Huijsen to Real Madrid for £50million, Bournemouth could lose their second central defender of the summer transfer window.",
      "Illia Zabarnyi is being targeted by PSG and Fabrizio Romano claims that the French side are advancing in talks with Bournemouth, and have already agreed personal terms.",
      "A transfer fee has not been agreed however. The Cherries want as much as £51m.",
      "Manchester United are ready to offer a player-plus-cash deal for Hugo Ekitike. The Eintracht Frankfurt forward has already drawn interest from Liverpool and Chelsea with the Frenchman's club remaining firm on their £85m valuation.",
      "It is reported that United could use Joshua Zirkzee in a deal.",
      "Manchester United reportedly want to receive around €35m if they are to sell Antony this summer. That is according to Diario de Sevilla, who suggest that Real Betis are very keen to keep the Brazilin after his loan spell in Spain.",
      "But they cannot afford the Red Devils' asking price. Instead, they have been forced to get creative. They suggested a co-ownership deal to United which would involve them paying an initial €20m and buy more later down the line.",
      "But that idea was swiftly rejected by the Red Devils, who are sticking to their guns over Antony's future."

      "Manchester United's summer rebuild is already well underway thanks to the capture of Matheus Cunha, but there's more to come. The Brazil international is the first of what many expect to be a run of signings as Ruben Amorim looks to streamline his squad.",
      "United have confirmed Victor Lindelof, Jonny Evans and Christian Eriksen will leave upon the expiry of their contracts, though Tom Heaton is due to extend his stay. Those leaving for nothing are unlikely to be the only players to depart, though.",
      "If Amorim wants to further strengthen his squad without the financial benefit of European football, he may well need to sanction further sales. Alejandro Garnacho is among those who could fetch a tidy sum, though early reports of a Serie A move for Rasmus Hojlund have grown quieter of late.",
      "Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho and Antony are all expected to be surplus to requirements of ending last season out on loan. Real Betis are hopeful of keeping Antony at the club, though Chelsea's feelings about Sancho were rather different.",
      "Newcastle United could be about to offer Marcus Rashford a route out of Old Trafford. The Magpies could also offer the England star a chance of Champions League football, though there's still work to be done.",
      "According to The Sun, Newcastle's preference is for a season-long loan while Manchester United would prefer a permanent sale. Rashford's current deal runs until 2028, and he is one of the highest earners in the Premier League.",
      "Rashford impressed on loan at Aston Villa last term, but their failure to qualify for the Champions League makes a return unlikely. Barcelona have begun to look elsewhere, despite previous interest, with Nico Williams close to a move at the time of writing.",
      "Former Everton star Pat Nevin has called on the club to raid Manchester United for Rasmus Hojlund. Danish frontman Hojlund struggled in front of goal last season, but Nevin believes a move to Merseyside could be the perfect fit.",
      "\"There are two or three players that they could think about bringing in from Manchester United but Rasmus Hojlund is the one that sticks out,\" Nevin told Spin Genie after urging Everton to look at the loan market. \"If you look at his style of play, it’s a perfect match with how David Moyes likes to play. While his numbers haven't been great this season, Moyes loves hard workers and that's something you can never complain about in regards to Hojlund.",
      "\"It's not very often David Moyes has had a 20-30 goals-per-season striker. He’s had strikers who run in behind and create space to bring others into play, so, if he's available, Hojlund could be a tempting option for Everton to sign on loan.\"",
      "Chelsea should steer clear of a move for Alejandro Garnacho, according to their former midfielder Emmanuel Petit. Speaking to talkSPORT Bet, Petit argued the Argentine's visible frustration in recent weeks is a concern.",
      "“Chelsea should steer clear of Alejandro Garnacho, he might be a decent guy but I didn’t like his behaviour on Manchester United’s tour,\" Petit said. “He is showing frustration but has had a lot of chances to show his potential on the pitch, but still we don’t know what to expect from him. He gives 100% and shows great commitment, but we haven’t seen him really improve as a player.",
      "“The mentality is there on the pitch but he hasn’t been improving step by step. Chelsea already have wingers in similar situations with the same frustrations. Signing Garnacho is not a good idea.”",
      "Manchester United have launched their new home kit for the 2025/26 season with an Adidas shirt paying tribute to Old Trafford.",
      "Fans can order their Men's, Women's and Kid's shirt today."

      "Gianluigi Donnarumma is confident he will sign a new contract with Paris Saint-Germain as he confirmed his agent remains locked in talks with the French champions. Donnarumma arrived at the Parc des Princes in 2021.",
      "He has enjoyed a highly-successful spell in the French capital since then, winning 10 major trophies. The Italian was a key member of the team which won the treble this season, storming to the Ligue 1 title, beating Reims in the Coupe de France final and smashing Inter Milan in the Champions League final.",
      "Despite his importance to Luis Enrique's side and his standing as one of the world's top keepers, the 26-year-old's contract is set to expire next summer. That has led to growing uncertainty over his future in the French capital.",
      "That uncertainty has attracted the eye of a number of suitors, including Manchester United. The Red Devils are looking for a new keeper this summer following the abject performance of Andre Onana.",
      "Onana kept just nine clean sheets in the Premier League last season, frequently drawing criticism. Donnarumma emerged as a potential replacement for the Cameroon international earlier this summer.",
      "But in a fresh blow to United boss Ruben Amorim, Donnarumma has confirmed that talks are progressing. He also insisted that he had full faith in his agent to get a deal done while he focused on the Club World Cup.",
      "\"Yes, we are moving forward. My agent is talking to the club. I am focused on the match and the trophy, but we have no problems,\" he said ahead of PSG's clash with Botafogo.",
      "\"I always give 100 percent for this club and the supporters, it's a club that has given me everything, playing for PSG is incredible. The Club World Cup is a very important competition for us.",
      "\"We must continue to remain 100 per cent focused to reach the final and the trophy. Everyone is hungry for victories, to win titles; it’s important for now and for next year.”",

      "The wall of the Manchester United academy gym at Carrington may be in need of a revamp. It is adorned by Scott McTominay, Marcus Rashford and Alejandro Garnacho.",
      "Tom Heaton is also on it. At the time of the interior decoration, all four were United first team squad members. Three still are, technically, but Heaton is likely to be the only one remaining come the end of summer.",
      "In the main building, there are young and old images of past graduates. Dean Henderson is one of the most recent, a success story for the United academy but not at United.",
      "United's outgoing academy director Nick Cox celebrated Henderson's man-of-the-match performance in the FA Cup final on X. Henderson was, briefly, United's first homegrown No.1 since Gary Walsh. The chances of an academy talent making the grade at United are more remote than for those in any other position.",
      "Manchester United have launched their new home kit for the 2025/26 season with an Adidas shirt paying tribute to Old Trafford.",
      "Fans can order their Men's, Women's and Kid's shirt today.",
      "£85",
      "Cox always accepted goalkeepers were a conundrum. Enough were needed to play, train and cover the first team, so a minimum of six were needed in the junior teams. United relish emergency loan calls from clubs for goalkeepers as Henderson's first career appearance was as an emergency loanee at non-league Stockport County in 2016.",
      "The image of Henderson can still motivate the incumbent academy custodians. Henderson has won the FA Cup, will be playing in Europe next season and there are whispers he could supplant Jordan Pickford as the England No.1.",
      "\"We take great pride in seeing our boys have great careers away from here,\" Cox said. \"If we hinged everything on who crosses the white line (for United), we'd all be miserable.\"",
      "Cox's work at United is done and he will move to Everton as their technical director later this year. “Nick has made a huge contribution to Manchester United over the past nine years,\" United's director of football Jason Wilcox said. \"I was already well aware of his qualities before I arrived at the club and have really enjoyed working together.",
      "“Identifying and developing the best youth talent remains one of this club’s top priorities, and we are grateful for the work Nick has done to provide such a strong foundation for us to continue to build on.\"",
      "2019, the year that Henderson became a Premier League player with Sheffield United, coincided with Cox's appointment as head of the United academy. Nicky Butt assumed the role of head of first team development and both made invaluable contributions to reviving one of the most important sectors at United.",
      "In the years after Sir Alex Ferguson's retirement, the academy was neglected. Following Brian McClair's departure in 2015, there was no full-time academy head for a year. Instead, it was jointly run by the club secretary John Alexander and John Murtough, long before he assumed the prominent post of football director in 2021.",
      "United were thrashed 5-1 by Chelsea, in the midst of monopolising the FA Youth Cup, in January 2016. Louis van Gaal watched Marcus Rashford from the stands at Altrincham a month before Rashford's stratospheric start to his professional career.",
      "That under 18 side also endured a 12-match losing run. Later that year, United's under 14s were annihilated 9-0 by Manchester City. There was uproar in Northern Ireland when United did not participate in the Milk Cup in 2015.",
      "The academy's reputation was buttressed at senior level by the breakthroughs of Rashford and Jesse Lingard, the 2016 FA Cup final matchwinner. Van Gaal handed debuts to 12 academy players, the majority of them undeserved or utterly unforeseen. Paddy McNair and Cameron Borthwick-Jackson had brief purple patches that gave the illusion the academy was in ship-shape.",
      "It wasn't until Butt returned to United to head the academy in February 2016. He oversaw an aggressive recruitment drive in the close season with Tahith Chong, Lee O'Connor, Nishan Burkart, Joshua Bohui and Millen Baars. None became United mainstays but a marker was laid down.",
      "After his promotion to the first team coaching staff by Jose Mourinho in 2018, some players found McKenna to be akin to a school teacher. His success at Ipswich Town is evidence that McKenna had the mettle to manage adults but his avuncular streak was apparent when he supported a nervous Gomes, aged 16, during a live televised interview with MUTV at the player of the year awards.",
      "Mourinho despaired at some of the players in the relegated under 21 side in 2018. \"Roshaun Williams, f*****g hell,\" he scoffed to a confidant. For Mourinho's final pre-season tour, Greenwood, Garner and Gomes were all included in the squad to usher in the more promising contingent.",
      "Cox ramped up United's overseas recruitment. Hannibal Mejbri cost £9m from Monaco in 2019, a year before United raided Barcelona, Real Madrid and Atletico Madrid for Marc Jurado, Alvaro Fernandez and Alejandro Garnacho.",
      "The European intake was never driven by Brexit, according to Cox. Jurado, Fernandez and Garnacho filled gaps at academy level to support the first team and all just happened to all be based in Spain, was his version of events.",
      "Fernandez is another United academy success story but one that got away from the first team. Garnacho's United career seems certain to end prematurely after five years yet he will be fondly remembered for his FA Youth Cup and FA Cup final winning goals.",
      "Cox coaxed Garnacho from Atletico Madrid to United via Zoom calls and the aid of an interpreter from his spare bedroom during lockdown in 2020. He wryly recalled his sons, aged 14 and 10 at the time, arguing outside over their X Box.",
      "Mark Dempsey, the academy coach brought back to United by Ole Gunnar Solskjaer in 2018, likened Garnacho to Peter Barnes, an old teammate during his fleeting playing career at United. Garnacho ended up ousting Rashford and has been bracketed with more celebrated United wingers.",
      "\"Only at 50 or 100 games can you start to think they might have cracked it,\" Cox once said. It could be 144 and out from Garnacho.",
      "Domestically, United bought Joe Hugill amid competition from Arsenal and Tottenham Hotspur in 2020. Charlie McNeill also made headlines as he defected from City for £750,000.",
      "United's academy fell behind City's for several years, which made the McNeill deal such a coup. McNeill started out at the United academy before he was lured to City in 2014. City offered to put McNeill's siblings in St Bede's College.",
      "More significantly in 2014, City opened the City Football Academy. United sources accept their own training complex at Carrington is no longer fit for purpose, though their new first team building is due to be finished later this summer.",
      "Darren Fletcher's sons, Jack and Tyler, spent nine years in the City academy before their homecoming at United in 2014. Both are youth internationals, one for England and one for Scotland. United considered City's simultaneous approach for Harrison Parker to be a \"revenge move\" after the deal for the Fletchers.",
      "Kobbie Mainoo, born in a City stronghold in Stockport, is another graduate who United figures feel highlights the academy's revival. Those who know Mainoo believe he would have gone to City at youth level had United's academy not been overhauled by Butt and Cox.",
      "United's domestic recruitment has had to become more intense since Brexit regulations prevented English clubs from signing under- 8s from overseas. The Fletcher twins, Harry Amass and Chido Obi have all been involved with the first team. Toby Collyer and Ethan Ennis joined from Brighton and Liverpool in 2022. United include Ayden Heaven, a £1.5million signing from Arsenal's academy, among them.",
      "Cox was saddened by Brexit blocking United from assembling more multicultural squads. He felt United's ethos always had a blend of local lads and overseas recruits. The Youth Cup winners in 2022 had a Czech, a Norwegian and two Spaniards in the starting XI.",
      "Maxi Oyedele, born in Salford and now at Legia Warsaw, has already played for the Poland national side and is generating notable interest. Zach Baumann, from Bolton, has played for the Ukraine youth team.",
      "With a predominantly British squad, United secured a triple-crown success in 2023-24. The only blemish was on the night they froze in a surprising Youth Cup loss at Swindon Town.",
      "In February 2020, United reached the Youth Cup semi-finals for the first time in eight years. It was not a vintage squad and Mejbri, with 13 appearances, had the most first-team exposure. It nevertheless represented another progressive stride.",
      "A potent youth team underachieved in the competition the next year, losing 1-0 to Liverpool at Leigh Sports Village, before the glory in 2022. The final, staged at Old Trafford, set a new record for a Youth Cup attendance as 67,492 clicked through the turnstiles.",
      "Cox was never going to allow that triumph to define the academy. His role was so broad he restructured the coaching staff, rebuilt the sports science team, considered psychological support, redeveloped the performance analysis team and built a life skills programme.",
      "His responsibilities evolved significantly, segueing from effectively a dual-role with Butt. Cox also sensibly downplayed the presence of youngsters training with the first team, attempting to counter the hype and provide context for their temporary promotions.",
      "No, it did not mean they were primed to be the next superstar. It is often owed to first team injuries, recovery days or international commitments. It was different when Garnacho missed the Youth Cup final media day at the academy building as Ralf Rangnick deemed him worthy of senior squad status.",
      "Tyrell Warren was one of the first academy players to be namechecked by Mourinho after he took over at United. A former academy teammate of Rashford's, he is now at Grimsby Town in League Two yet the Mancunian remains a shining example of the United academy.",
      "Cox attended United's EFL Trophy match with Barrow in 2022, flanked by Tony Whelan, Dave Bushell and Eamon Mulvey, stalwarts of the United youth set-up. Darren Fletcher was also present at Holker Street.",
      "Before kick-off, Warren and Adam Temple, a former United academy coach, entered the boardroom for a catch-up. \"That's a classy Manchester United thing to do,\" Cox enthused. \"Because they've been brought up that way. In that they come to welcome us to talk about how their season's going. And you sit there and you go, 'that is youth development in a nutshell'.",
      "\"A young lad that's been through your programme that is absolutely maxing out, he has reached his full potential. He's earning a living in the game.\"",
      "Warren has since moved to Grimsby Town, seven places better off than Barrow last season. He had not hit a wall."

      "This time next year Ewan Sharp will be at the centre of an historic World Cup.",
      "He could even come up against a few familiar faces from his Manchester United days - perhaps a meeting with Portugal's Cristiano Ronaldo and Bruno Fernandes, or facing off against his mentor Ralf Rangnick, now in charge of Austria.",
      "Sharp spent a year at Old Trafford, working alongside Rangnick, and is now part of the coaching staff at Canada, who are co-hosts for next summer's World Cup.",
      "Right now the Canadians are involved in the Gold Cup and face Curaçao in their second group game tonight having eased past Honduras 6-0 in their opener.",
      "Canada, managed by former Leeds United boss Jesse Marsch, are one of the favourites for the tournament alongside their co-hosts USA and Mexico. Sharp, 32, will hope this summer brings success and that the formula can be repeated on the world stage in 12 months' time.",
      "\"The Gold Cup in a lot of ways replicates the World Cup and we want to use that as a learning and an experience. I think in the last year we have learned a lot about our players and our group and the squad depth is improving.\"",
      "Sharp's role within the staff set-up is a hybrid of analysis and on-pitch coaching. It's one he relishes with his background in video analysis lending itself to an analytical role while his desire to one day be a manager means he relishes the coaching aspect.",
      "\"Day to day I am involved in scouting our players, watching their matches, looking at players we should consider calling in, looking at our core guys,\" Sharp explains.",
      "\"As well as being responsible for the opposition match planning and prep and thinking about ways in which we can play against them.",
      "\"In camp, a lot of that prep work is done, so I am a bit more free to help with training planning and coaching and working with individual players.\"",
      "Sharp's rise to the role started in the Red Bull organisation, where he first met Marsch and also Rangnick. It was the German who took Sharp to United.",
      "It was one of many difficult periods in United's recent history with the club having axed Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and, unsure of where to go next, turned to Rangnick and his team as an interim option.",
      "An initial honeymoon period saw United beaten just twice in 17 games - albeit one was a penalty shoot out defeat to Middlesbrough in the FA Cup - but after a derby day thumping at Manchester City and a Champions League exit to Atletico Madrid and with qualification for next season's elite competition slipping away, the wheels came off. United won just three times in their final 14 matches. A deal to bring Erik ten Hag in for the following campaign was announced in April and Sharp admits it became a tough sell for the coaching staff.",
      "\"Things started off in a good way, I felt we had some progress,\" said the affable and conversational Sharp from his home in Florida. \"As the season went on, when certain objectives were out of reach and we'd been knocked out of the Champions League by Atletico, once that was gone and it became more and more difficult to reach the top four, the environment and the feeling was one of disappointment.",
      "\"There was a bit of a slide and perhaps that same appetite for what we were bringing to the table disappeared a bit. When you are competing for something you are on the edge and every player is so ready for it, and as soon as that goes... you see it at end of seasons when teams slide a bit.",
      "\"We hit a bit of that and the fact that we weren't full-time staff, it was hard for us to put something on the table because it had already been announced that Ten Hag was coming in.",
      "\"We couldn't say 'if you do this, you can be a part of this, and we are building this'. We are now managing it until the next guy comes in and that becomes a challenge.",
      "\"Was it viewed unfairly? The expectations at Man United are as high as they can be, and rightly so. We knew that going into it, anything short of a really good winning record, and trying to push for the Champions League and to have a good run in the Champions League, that was the objective. We were disappointed we didn't achieve that but there were a lot of challenges going on.\"",
      "Rangnick famously said United needed 'open heart surgery' in a quote that didn't sit well at the time but has perhaps become somewhat prophetic. United lifted two trophies under Ten Hag and reached the Europa League final last season, but the latest rebuild under Ruben Amorim is only just beginning.",
      "For Sharp, the chapter at Old Trafford was a privilege and a learning curve. The chance to work with elite players at an elite club, even if it was a difficult situation from the get-go amid poor form, a club at a crossroads and fan perception or Rangnick and an interim coaching team.",
      "\"Arriving at Man United was a big responsibility but I kept telling myself that Ralf had brought me here for a reason,\" reflects Sharp.",
      "\"I might not know everything about the game but I now what Ralf wants. I don't have all the solutions but I can help Ralf communicate his message. The players were receptive to it and open to it.",
      "\"I am not trying to help Bruno take a free kick but I can help him understand what the manager is asking of him or I can sit with him and say things I saw from the game and have a discussion, and perhaps help them see that for us and how Ralf wants us to play, this is why we want to see it this way. Most of the time players want to be better and to help the team so they will fit in with what the manager wants.",
      "\"It was a very difficult situation that we went into. I am so grateful for the opportunity but it was a challenging environment to be in. Partly because of where the club was at in that moment, but also in the way in which we came in. We came in on the back of Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, who you could feel was loved by the people inside the club. Everyone loved him, from the staff in the canteen to everyone.",
      "\"We came in and are coming in for an interim. When Ralf talked about that open heart surgery, one of his greatest strengths is creating a continuity and a vision for a club. Ralf knows how to put people in positions to build a whole club so that at least it works to a vision. And for Ralf to do that he has to be given the reins. He was recognising what a lot of the problems were and a lot of the things that could be improved to get it back to where it should be.\"",
      "United are not yet there, three years on from Sharp's departure. The hope is that under Amorim the Reds can embark on a successful journey back to the top. Sharp himself has been on quite the journey in football to reach the top.",
      "He left his native Scotland to go to America on a football scholarship at university and became interested in coaching. A friend introduced him to video analysis and Sharp dived into the analytical world and began doing analysis for the college he was attending to do his masters. An opportunity opened up in New York with the Red Bulls second team and it was there that Sharp met Rangnick.",
      "\"I have been lucky, lucky to meet the right people, for them to open doors for me,\" he adds, somewhat modestly. \"But then I know when I step through that door I can add value and contribute. Each step, you get hungry for the next environment.",
      "\"It (my journey) is a bit unconventional and a bit different but I am inspired by others. Fabian Hurzeler at Brighton is an example, he didn't have a big playing career and is a similar age to me and is performing really well in the Premier League with a great club.",
      "\"I am ambitious, hungry and believe I have some value to bring to the table and I have always trusted and back myself, so I have never been afraid to give my opinion which is important, but always in the right way.",
      "\"For me (being a head coach) is an aim, I am ambitious and hungry and every time I take a step up I am thinking about what is next.",
      "\"I love being in Europe and England and being close to my family. Having my mum and dad come to games at Old Trafford and see me down there was special for me. Those are memories I cherish.",
      "\"I would love to get back to England, but I don't feel in a rush to get there, but I want to keep developing and learning.\""

      "After finishing with a negative goal difference for the second Premier League season running last term, Manchester United are rightly prioritising the additions of attackers this summer.",
      "United wrapped up their first signing of the transfer window just over a week ago, securing Matheus Cunha's signature from Wolves after triggering his £62.5million release clause. He has signed a five-year contract at Old Trafford with the option of a sixth.",
      "United are now in hot pursuit of Brentford star Bryan Mbeumo. They tabled an opening offer for the Cameroonian earlier this month, understood to be worth £55m, but it was rejected.",
      "Talks between United and the Bees are understood to remain ongoing and the Reds are confident they will eventually secure Mbeumo's signature. The 25-year-old has informed confidants he wants to move to Old Trafford.",
      "In addition to signing Cunha and setting their sights on Mbeumo, United also want to sign a striker before the start of next season.",
      "They are continuing to be linked with a plethora of centre-forwards, such as Napoli's Victor Osimhen and Sporting Lisbon star Viktor Gyokeres, but they are yet to have settled on a preferred target after missing out on Liam Delap.",
      "On the ten occasions second-choice goalkeeper Altay Bayindir deputised for Onana in 2024/25, there were several instances where he failed to cover himself in glory, raising doubts about his suitability to be the latter's deputy. Onana, too, has been guilty of committing one too many errors throughout his United career.",
      "With United tying Tom Heaton down to a new one-year deal, there is a growing expectation Bayindir will leave this summer. It would make sense for him to leave in search of regular game time to boost his chances of becoming Turkey's No.1 ahead of next year's World Cup.",
      "Onana also is not safe from being pointed in the direction of the exit amid United's willingness to sell any member of the squad this summer, meaning it is entirely possible the club could recruit a new No.1 this summer, although the recruitment of a striker has to take priority.",
      "Over the last few weeks, Aston Villa goalkeeper Emiliano Martinez has been heavily linked with a move to Old Trafford. He has improved significantly since joining Villa from Arsenal in 2020, helping Villa get back into the Champions League and winning the World Cup and Copa America (twice) with Argentina.",
      "Turning 33 in September, Martinez is entering his prime years as a goalkeeper. Despite being somewhat erratic at times, just as he demonstrated when he floored Rasmus Hojlund on the final day of the Premier League season at Old Trafford last month, he has banked more credit than Onana has over the last few years.",
      "If United were to swoop for the Argentine, they would be doing so with a view to making him their first-choice goalkeeper, meaning they may have to sell Onana. The former Inter Milan shot-stopper will not be content with warming the bench.",
      "If United swoop for Martinez and bring him to Old Trafford this summer, he would become the first goalkeeper they have signed from a Premier League rival to become their No.1 since Edwin van der Sar in 2005.",
      "The legendary Dutchman joined United from Fulham 20 years ago at the age of 34 and remained United's No.1 up until his retirement at the end of the 2010/11 season.",
      "United have already demonstrated through the addition of Cunha and pursuit of Mbeumo they are prioritising signing proven Premier League players this summer, meaning it is not beyond the realms of possibility they may also look closer to home when attempting to sign a goalkeeper."

      "It's difficult to remember the last time Manchester United reached a summer transfer window without needing to offload plenty of players.",
      "Nine departures have already been confirmed this summer after the club released their retained list, and that figure will undoubtedly swell over the coming months. Partly because there are a handful of players who have already been told they have no future at the club, and partly because United need to raise funds to sanction the deals needed to improve their squad.",
      "Moving players on is never an easy task, and so United have their work cut out for them this summer as they look to offload the likes of Marcus Rashford, Alejandro Garnacho, Antony and Jadon Sancho to name just a few. But their task might have just been made a little easier.",
      "United require a fee of £14.58m to avoid a loss on Sancho under the Premier League's profitability and sustainability regulations (PSR), and while he didn't exactly put himself in the shop window with three league goals in the 2024/25 season, United should be able to find someone willing to pay a £14.58m fee for a player who is showing an eagerness to move on.",
      "Antony's situation as a little more complicated by the need for United to recoup £32.58m to avoid a loss under PSR. That being said, his impressive loan spell at Real Betis in the second half of the season has seen him create a market for himself.",
      "There are still plenty of conversations needed before either player says goodbye to United, but both are eager to do what they can to move on. and that's a step in the direction."

      "A move for a striker is expected to follow after the Mbeumo deal is wrapped up but there has been talk of United replacing Andre Onana in goal. AS Monaco have reportedly offered the United No.1 an escape route out of Manchester with Aston Villa's Emiliano Martinez lined-up to replace him.",
      "In the past 24 hours, a number of updates have emerged regarding the future of Marcus Rashford and Jadon Sancho. Rashford's dream move to Barcelona seems to be off with Nico Williams set to move to the Nou Camp while clubs in Italy are lining-up a move for Sancho.",

ESPN have reported that Ruben Amorim is yet to make a decision about whether Rashford, Antony, Alejandro Garnacho or Jadon Sancho will be part of his squad for the summer tour of the United States.",
      "Jadon Sancho is prepared to settle for a move to Italy after Chelsea decided not to buy him with Napoli reputedly keen on Sancho, having had a £40m bid rejected for fellow United winger Alejandro Garnacho in January.",

      "\"I'm confident that we will come out of the window with a much stronger team than what we've gone into,\" Omar Berrada said in a recent interview about Manchester United's transfer business.",
      "Going into the final stretch of June and into July, United have already done that. Matheus Cunha, an attacking playmaker who scored 15 Premier League goals last term, has already signed after the club triggered his £62.5million release clause at Wolves.",
      "Work to add Bryan Mbeumo to Ruben Amorim's attack has been in progress for two weeks now. Despite Tottenham's suggested plan to hijack the move and reunite the forward, who scores five more goals than Cunha, with Thomas Frank, it's understood that the 25-year-old wants to join United.",
      "After Mbeumo, a striker will be prioritised followed by the potential of a new goalkeeper and defender. Victor Osimhen, Hugo Ekitike and Viktor Gyokeres are all on their radar but the fees being touted make it hard to imagine a deal being sealed any time soon.",
      "However, the window is open for over two more months and United aren't going to act restlessly just to get players through the door. \"We’re going to do our best to do more signings quickly,\" Berrada told The Athletic recently.",
      "\"Sometimes when you’re not quick, it’s because you’re negotiating and you’re trying to make sure you get the right value for money. So being efficient or quick isn’t necessarily the best thing for the club.”",
      "The Premier League's Profit & Sustainability rules (PSR) are also set to force United to work smartly. It's been widely reported that United need to sell players to raise funds this summer and yet, that hasn't happened yet.",
      "Alejandro Garnacho has been linked with moves to Italy, Spain and Premier League rivals while Antony's short-term stint at Real Betis has left the Los Verdiblancos contemplating every available route to sign him permanently.",
      "The situation that has gathered some pace in recent days is Jadon Sancho's. After Chelsea paid £5m to cancel their obligation to sign the forward for £25m, Sancho's future beyond this summer is unclear.",
      "Italian journalist Marco Giordano has reported that Juventus have made an official bid worth €25million (£21.3m) for Sancho, who is yet to be convinced of a move to Turn. That figure falls slightly below United's asking price but as it is transfer season, there could be a workaround.",
      "United need a striker and the prospect of paying £60m+ for Gyokeres or Osimhen or Ekitike seems as far-fetched as United competing for the Premier League title this season. Cheaper alternatives continued to be linked and one name which constantly finds itself in the rumour mill is Dusan Vlahovic.",
      "After turning down Arsenal to join Juve, Vlahovic has found himself tipped to move to the Premier League. The Serbia international has scored 56 goals for the Old Lady but Randal Kolo Muani's permanent switch from Paris Saint-Germain this summer means he isn't guaranteed minutes under Igor Tudor.",
      "According to Corriere dello Sport, Juventus' general director Damien Comolli flew out to the United States to look at solving Vlahovic's situation. With 12 months left on his contract, it's claimed that Juventus have proposed a new deal, one that is of no interest to the striker.",
      "It's said that Vlahovic currently earns £10.2m per year, which sits just under £200,000-per-week, but the Serie A's side's new offer will see him earn closer to £147,000-per-week. The probability of Vlahovic moving on from Turn is greater than ever and it's understood that Juventus value him at just €30m (£25.6m).",
      "Selling Sancho to Juventus for close to £25m and signing a striker with a decent track record in front of goal for the same price would be a smart move. Something United have lacked in the past is acute deals and this would be a masterstroke from Jason Wilcox."

      "United had also been hoping to bank the £25million fee Chelsea were obligated to pay to turn their loan deal for Jadon Sancho into a permanent move. As it transpired, the Blues opted to pay a £5m penalty to United to get out of paying that fee.",

      "Amad joined United from the Italian side in January 2021 as a tender 18-year-old. He was a signing for the future and former United boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, who was in charge at the time, had every hope he would fulfil his potential in M16.",
      "\"Manchester United has such a proud history of developing young players and everything is in place to enable Amad to reach his potential here,\" said Solskjaer, speaking in January 2021.",

      "Fortunately, Mazraoui's versatility means that he is not restricted to playing in just one role, and he has played as a right wing-back, a left wing-back and centre-back since United's transition to a 3-4-2-1 system last November.",
      "\"It's hard to see the best position,\" Amorim said of Mazraoui in April. \"His background is like a full-back, in a defence of four.",

      "Having responded to a season that ended on a minus goal difference with four defensive signings last year, Manchester United are redressing the balance this summer after their goal difference became ten times worse.",
      "Matheus Cunha lived up to his number '10' with Wolves last season, tallying 15 Premier League goals. Bryan Mbeumo got five more for Brentford and United are in the market for a new No.9.",
      "Well-placed figures at United spoke about three or four signings before the end of last season. Three of those would go straight into the first team.",
      "A new frontman, Cunha, Mbeumo, Amad and Bruno Fernandes in the same starting XI is an imposing attack. Ruben Amorim will have Mason Mount, Kobbie Mainoo and probably Joshua Zirkzee to call upon as well.",
      "Beyond the three intended attacking additions, the starting XI may otherwise be untouched. United absolutely need an athletic midfielder but they have to get Manuel Ugarte, a considerable investment at £50.75million, up to speed after a patchy first season.",
      "A new signing's maiden campaign can always be couched as one of adaptation. Ugarte was not Erik ten Hag's pick to shore up a porous midfield and United's style under the Dutchman was no different before his eventual defenestration in October.",
      "Ugarte was entrusted by Ruud van Nistelrooy, a fellow fluent Spanish speaker, during his caretaker stint and he started in 28 of his former Sporting coach Amorim's 42 matches in the dugout. Yet Ugarte ended the season behind Casemiro, regarded as a busted flush, in the pecking order and was benched for the Europa League final.",
      "Casemiro's fine form was reserved solely for Europe and he could be redundant in a season comprising only domestic football. Provisionally, Amorim has to reinstall Ugarte with Fernandes as his probable partner in midfield.",
      "Ugarte and Fernandes have started in a midfield two 11 times and United were beaten on only four occasions. Two of those defeats came three days after Europa League knockout ties, a period when United were half-hearted in their weekend fixtures.",
      "Whether United are able to shift Casemiro or not, they require a major reinforcement in the middle third. Mainoo's positioning is largely irrelevant as the alternative is Toby Collyer, whose three starts for the club have come against teams from Scotland, Romania and League One.",
      "United are about to release two over-the-hill centre backs but they do not need another one. United recruited Leny Yoro, Matthijs de Ligt and Ayden Heaven within seven months, Harry Maguire has had his contract extended while Noussair Mazraoui and Luke Shaw could be permanently relocated to centre half.",
      "\"I've enjoyed it,\" Heaven said of his first four months at United. \"It's been tough, the team has really helped me to play my best and I just want to keep going next season.",
      "\"I always try my hardest when I play to impress people and I think I've been doing that. I just want to continue.\"",
      "Lisandro Martinez, recovering from an anterior cruciate ligament injury, should return well before the end of the calendar year. The 20-year-old Tyler Fredricson made a decent transition to the first team, albeit in relatively sedate circumstances (and two defeats).",
      "Talking about a lighter workload in relation to Shaw suggests a punchline is imminent. In all seriousness, with a reduced schedule Shaw could possibly hack it as a left winger if he improves his conditioning. United took a relative punt on Patrick Dorgu and it seems inevitable that the left wing will be a position to strengthen next year when Shaw has a year left on his contract (unless a club has taken him off United's hands by then).",
      "Shaw, 30 next month, started five games last season and all of them were at centre back. United lost four and, privately, Amorim must rue picking him in the Europa League final when his form and fitness did not merit that privilege.",
      "United cannot rely on Shaw, who has played in 27 out of 112 matches in the past two seasons. Harry Amass is a sprightlier left winger though there is significant risk in having a 20-year-old and an 18-year-old vying for such a demanding role with Mbeumo pencilled in on the other flank.",
      "Dorgu's first four months were mixed and one assist was a derisory return. It would not have helped that whenever he had the ball and looked up he saw either Rasmus Hojlund or Zirkzee. Dorgu will not be cut any more slack this time next year.",
      "Staff at United speak positively about the Dane's athleticism and his Serie A pedigree. \"It's been tough, challenging,\" Dorgu admitted. \"But I'm happy I played a lot.",
      "\"I think the manager trusts me and I try to help the team, so just happy to be on the pitch and I try to do my best over here.",
      "\"It's a bit different from my old team but I was playing attacking there as well. I just need to adapt to the players and how everyone moves on the pitch.",
      "\"It's obviously different because the fanbase is so massive. A lot of people talk! Everyone is talking about United. It is difficult for young players but I think if you have the right mentality I think everyone can cope with it and it's about performing on the pitch.\"",
      "Do that and United may be back in the pluses."

      "",
      "7) Borussia Dortmund – £52.48m\nThey used the Club World Cup transfer window to bring in Jobe Bellingham and Yan Couto and they could add Jason Sancho.",
      "",
      "6) Tottenham – £60.52m\nThat’s a decent whack of money spent on Kevin Danso, Mathys Tel and Luka Vuskovic before Thomas Frank even gets a say.",

      "",
      "3) Real Madrid – £97.6m\nThey had already dropped £50m on Dean Huijsen and £8.5m on a few weeks of Trent Alexander-Arnold before they agreed to sign man-child Franco Mastantuono for an awful lot of money.",
      "",
      "2) Chelsea – £102.6m\nThey were the top spenders in the summers of 2024, 2023 and 2022 and will be up there in 2025 thanks to pre-arranged moves for Estevao, Dario Essugo, Mamadou Sarr and Kendry Paez. Throw in the £30m signing of Liam Delap and the Blues are already making very expensive waves.",
      "",
      "1) Manchester City – £109.6m\nThat’s the price of a Rayan Ait-Nouri from Wolves, a Rayan Cherki from Lyon and a Tijanji Reijnders from AC Milan, and all of them feel like bargains. Pep Guardiola wanted Florian Wirtz but he will cost more on his own."

      "Florian Wirtz has become the most expensive attacking midfielder in history by an absurd margin – here’s a rundown of the top 20.",
      "",
      "1) Florian Wirtz – £116m/€135m (Bayer Leverkusen to Liverpool, June 2025)\nAs statements of intent from defending champions go, it’s a chunky one as Liverpool add the most expensive AM in history to a squad that cruised to Premier League glory last season.",
      "",
      "2) James Rodriguez – £63.2m/€80m (Monaco to Real Madrid, July 2014)\nNever before has a shop window been so successfully deployed as when Rodriguez and his giant pet grasshopper dominated the 2014 World Cup so thoroughly that Real Madrid couldn’t help but make the Colombian the fourth most expensive footballer ever at the time. His next permanent club being Everton remains hilarious.",
      "",
      "3) Thomas Lemar – £63m/€70m (Monaco to Atletico Madrid, June 2018)\nWith failed club-record bids from Arsenal and Liverpool in his back pocket, Lemar took his eternal search for justice to Spain and Diego Simeone has not let him go since.",
      "",
      "4) Dominik Szoboszlai – £60m/€69.8m (Leipzig to Liverpool, July 2023)\nNeeding to remodel their entire midfield, Liverpool first signed Alexis Mac Allister at an apparent knockdown price before mulling over the release clause of Szoboszlai and pulling ahead of Newcastle to trigger it before expiration.",
      "",
      "5) Kaka – £56m/€65m (AC Milan to Real Madrid, June 2009)\nThe world’s costliest signing of all time – at least for a couple of weeks. After a planned £91m move to Manchester City on £500,000-a-week wages collapsed the previous January, Kaka went for a slightly more modest fee and delivered even less flashy numbers: 29 goals, 39 assists, 120 appearances and two trophies in four years before heading back to the Rossoneri on a free.",
      "",
      "6) Bruno Fernandes – £55.6m/€65m (Sporting to Man Utd, January 2020)\nAdd-ons have already far surpassed the initial £46.6m fee, with Sporting potentially due another £12.7m if Fernandes wins the PFA Player of the Year award or makes the Ballon d’Or top three. Manchester United could have doubled their money but knew they couldn’t afford the risk.",
      "",
      "7) Mason Mount – £55m/€64.2m (Chelsea to Man Utd, July 2023)\nA year from free agency and yet Manchester United’s desperation led them to pay a fair whack for the England international and Champions League winner. He has shown little since.",
      "",
      "8) Oscar – £52m/€60m (Chelsea to Shanghai SIPG, January 2017)\n“Every football player, or every person who works, wants to earn money to help their families. I came from a social background in Brazil that is very poor. We didn’t have anything. This is the fruit of my work and when I earn this, it is because I conquered it. The same way I came here, I will be able to return to Europe.” Fair play, although that continental comeback will probably never materialise now he’s back in Brazil.",
      "",
      "9) Dani Olmo – £51m/€60m (Leipzig to Barcelona, August 2024)\nThere have been registration issues owing to his new club’s continued financial difficulties but when Olmo has been able to play he has contributed healthily, with 12 goals and seven assists in a disrupted debut season.",
      "",
      "10) Otavio – £50.5m/€60m (Porto to Al-Nassr, August 2023)\nA star of the Saudi Arabia summer transfer window that was, Otavio has fared well enough but rumours persist over a return to Europe.",
      "",
      "11) Zinedine Zidane – £46.6m/€76m (Juventus to Real Madrid, July 2001)\nWith Spurs presumably unwilling to let Tim Sherwood go, Real Madrid had to settle for second best and a man absolutely dripping in Galactico rizz.",
      "",
      "12) Teun Koopmeiners – £46.1m/€54.7m (Atalanta to Juventus, August 2024)\nShortly after being crowned a Europa League winner, Koopmeiners made the move one place up the Serie A table to accompany The Old Lady on their continued hopeful journey towards relevance.",
      "",
      "13) Gylfi Sigurdsson – £45m/€53m (Swansea to Everton, August 2017)\nPart of the single greatest season of Premier League club-specific signings, with Everton also bringing in Davy Klaassen (£23.6m), Henry Onyekuru (£6.8m), Sandro Ramirez (£5.2m), Jordan Pickford (£30m), Michael Keane (£25m), Wayne Rooney (free), Nikola Vlasic (£8m), Cenk Tosun (£27.5m) and Theo Walcott (£20m).",
      "",
      "14) Bernardo Silva – £43m/€50m (Monaco to Manchester City, May 2017)\nThe Portuguese has tried to leave almost every summer since but 14 trophies and more appearances under Pep Guardiola than any other player ever has been a fair consolation prize.",
      "",
      "15) Cole Palmer – £42.5m/€50.4m (Manchester City to Chelsea, September 2023)\nIt seemed like a ridiculous move at the time but was until recently the one unqualified transfer success of this Chelsea regime. Forty goals, 27 assist, 91 appearances and an eternal contract is fine business.",
      "",
      "16) Mesut Ozil – £42.4m/€50m (Real Madrid to Arsenal, September 2013)\nPoor Geraint Hughes must still be having flashbacks after being encompassed by giddy Arsenal fans celebrating the quite unfathomable capture of a Real Madrid star at his peak. Everyone knows how that five-year contract and three-year extension in 2018 played out eventually but there were moments of absolute brilliance first.",
      "",
      "17) Xavi Simons – £42.1m/€50m (Paris Saint-Germain to Leipzig, January 2025)\nAfter a pair of successful loans it was decided that selling club Leipzig would indulge in a spot of record-breaking buying, making Simons the most expensive player in their history by a mile.",
      "",
      "18) James Maddison – £40m/€46.3m (Leicester to Tottenham, June 2023)\nAt one stage the most expensive Premier League signing from a relegated club, Maddison would be fortunate to emulate a former holder of that title in Moussa Sissoko.",
      "",
      "19) Joelinton – £40m/€45m (Hoffenheim to Newcastle, July 2019)\nDoes he belong on the list of most expensive midfielders, forwards or strikers instead? Genuinely not sure. But Eddie Howe has treasured and transformed Steve Bruce’s trash in so very many ways.",
      "",
      "20) James Rodriguez – £38.5m/€45m (Porto to Monaco, May 2013)\nLong before a Galactico future could be considered, Rodriguez was moving to newly-minted Monaco as the more expensive part of a double transfer with Joao Moutinho. The Colombian scored nine goals and assisted 13 in his only Ligue Un season."

The reality is, though, that there may ultimately be little they can do about it.",

      "18) 🔽 Alexander Isak – Newcastle to Liverpool\nWe know Liverpool like Isak. Everyone likes Isak. But the Reds seem to be lurking with intent to break the British transfer record, which will be necessary to tempt Newcastle.

      "",
      "16) 🆕 Dusan Vlahovic – Juventus to Manchester United\nThe Serbia striker, linked with Arsenal since the womb, has apparently approached United directly because he fancies a move to Old Trafford. United, for their part, are quite receptive, especially having learned Vlahovic would cost just shy of £40million, which is less than Gyokeres. Keep an eye on this one.",
      "",
      "15) Marcus Rashford – Manchester United to Newcastle\nThe story goes that Newcastle are ‘confident of providing Rashford with an ideal stage to rebuild his career’. But they don’t want to pay for him – yet. Of course United want a permanent sale but the chances are the best they might get is a loan with an obligation.",

Fulham rejected a £32million proposal, with £26million guaranteed, and the Cottagers want it to be known that they won’t sell the forward unless they get an offer they can’t refuse. One Leeds would be daft to make.",

      "13) Joao Pedro – Brighton to Newcastle\nThe Seagulls forward is intent on leaving Brighton to take the next step but apparently, wherever he goes, he wants to be the first choice. Which won’t happen at Newcastle for as long as Isak is around. So what does it say about Isak’s future that Newcastle are about to enter talks to bring Pedro from the south coast to the North East? If that is the Magpies’ intention, they will have to get around Brighton’s £60million valuation, which won’t be easy if the Seagulls see Newcastle bank a massive fee for Isak.",
      "",
      "12) Benjamin Sesko – RB Leipzig to Arsenal\nThere was talk of Arsenal submitting a serious bid this week, but they are reluctant to meet Leipzig’s valuation, which falls somewhere between £68milion and £85million. Which was always going to be around the going rate for a top centre-forward this summer. Where there was more noise around Arsenal choosing Sesko, the momentum is building again around the other guy.",
      "",
      "11) Andy Robertson – Liverpool to Atletico Madrid\nAtletico Madrid made a cheeky request to secure their ‘dream’ signing, but their participation in Gianni Infantino’s wet dream may hold things up. We can see A-Rob being right up Diego Simeone’s street.",
      "",
      "10) Son Heung-min – Tottenham to Saudi Arabia\nIt was widely reported that Spurs are ready to sell their skipper, but only after they have milked for every last penny by parading him on pre-season tour in his homeland. Levy, that. Apparently, Al-Ahli, Al-Nassr and Al-Qadsiah are all prepared to pay £34million for Son, who is entering the final year of his contract at Spurs.",
      "",
      "9) 🔼 Marc Guehi – Crystal Palace to Liverpool\nWith a year left on his contract and a renewal unlikely, Palace are willing to cash in on their captain, who could be the subject of a ‘significant offer’ from the champions when they receive the Jarell Quansah money. The contract situation is important; it means Liverpool will be reluctant to spend over the odds, and while Palace won’t have their pants pulled down, they cannot risk the prospect of their skipper leaving for free.",

      "8) 🔼 Ousmane Diomande – Sporting Lisbon to Crystal Palace\nThis could be a major coup for Palace, who are in for a player strongly linked with Arsenal, Manchester United and Spurs in the past. The Ivorian is only 21 years young and played 31 times as Sporting won the Portuguese top flight last season. He’d be a brilliant Guehi replacement.",
      "",
      "7) 🔽 Bryan Mbeumo – Brentford to Manchester United\nMbeumo only had eyes for United before Frank’s appointment at Spurs. United remained confident of getting their man, and some reports suggest they have submitted a second offer. But Brentford have got what they want – a bidding war. Beyond that, we’re all guessing, but of the two interested parties, United are probably the most concerned right now.",
      "",
      "6) Viktor Gyokeres – Sporting Lisbon to Arsenal\nArsenal are still keeping both Gyokeres and Sesko dangling, with both keen to move to the Emirates, but they are having more trouble charming their clubs. Sporting’s stance has irked Gyokeres to the point he’s not willing to meet to clear the air and the Swede could go on strike to force a move when he returns from St Tropez. Juventus have been turned down in favour of Arsenal, who may reasonably feel they can land Gyokeres for slightly less than they may have to pay for Sesko.",
      "",
      "5) 🔼 Bryan Mbeumo – Brentford to Tottenham\nAll Spurs had to do to pique Mbeumo’s intrigue was sack the manager and appoint the Cameroonian’s old one. Thomas Frank’s appointment has opened Mbeumo’s mind to the possibility of joining Tottenham, and while he did seem pretty determined to join the Man Utd circus, there is momentum gathering again around Spurs’ interest, which would allow the forward to remain in London, playing for a manager he appreciates.",
      "",
      "4) Martin Zubimendi – Real Sociedad to Arsenal\nThis one got the ‘Here we go’ treatment well over a month ago but then it all went a bit quiet. There was talk of Real Madrid sticking their nose in. Fear not, though, Gooners. Everyone reckons it’s done. So why the wait? Zubimendi is in the middle of three-week FIFA-mandated holiday, while reports suggest both clubs would prefer for the deal to go through the books in July.",
      "",
      "3) Sverre Nypan – Rosenborg to Manchester City\nArsenal fancied their chances of landing the Norwegian wonderkid, and Villa were in talks in recent months. But City are in the mood for signings and it looks like they have agreed a £12.5million deal for the 18-year-old attacking midfielder. A medical was scheduled for last week but we’ve heard nothing since, while City are in the United States for a nonsense tournament.",
      "",
      "2) Milos Kerkez – Bournemouth to Liverpool\nThis seemed to be done, but now we are told that Liverpool and Bournemouth ‘remain in talks’. Given the Cherries have signed a replacement, we presume it’s the very fine details being discussed and Kerkez will be heading to Anfield imminently.",
      "",
      "1) 🔼 Jarell Quansah – Liverpool to Bayer Leverkusen\nAfter rumours died down, they have ramped right back up again. And just like that, Quansah has reportedly agreed personal terms with Erik ten Hag’s side and is expected to join for at least £30m."

      "Manchester United have reportedly made ‘initial contact’ with a goalkeeper who kept 18 clean sheets last season as an approach for current goalkeeper Andre Onana has been made by a European big hitter.",
      "United have seemingly given up on Onana after two seasons. In both his campaigns at Old Trafford, the former Inter Milan goalkeeper has made mistakes.",
      "In last season’s Premier League, he was at fault for three goals, and more in the Europa League.",
      "As a result, United are looking to go in a different direction, while also getting rid of Onana. According to Gianluca di Marzio, Monaco have ‘made an enquiry’ for the United keeper.",
      "It is not clear how much the Ligue 1 side would be willing to bid for Onana. However, Di Marzio states the goalkeeper who United ‘like the most’ is Atalanta’s Marco Carnesecchi.",
      "It is stated ‘initial contacts’ have been made with the goalkeeper’s agent, but not with his club, Atalanta, who it’s believed would not let Carnesecchi go without a satisfactory offer being made.",
      "The Italian kept 18 clean sheets last season – 13 in Serie A and five in the Champions League. Only three men kept clean sheets more often than he did in the Italian top flight last season.",
      "As such, it seems Carnesecchi would be a good option, and is a solid alternative to Emi Martinez, who United might struggle to sign.",
      "It’s been suggested they are willing to pay £40million for him, and that they’ve been given good signs the Argentina goalkeeper wants to join, with multiple reports suggesting he’d look favourably on a move to Old Trafford.",
      "But it has recently been reported that Atletico Madrid have the best chance of landing Martinez.",
      "Indeed, United and Atletico are said to be the two sides most likely to sign the keeper, but United are ‘ringing every day’ to try to convince him as it’s suggested his ‘preference’ is to go to Atletico as he wants to play under Diego Simeone.",
      "Atleti have Champions League football on offer, and United have no European football at all.",
      "That could similarly hurt them in pursuit of Carnesecchi, given he played in nine games of the elite European competition last season, and he’d play in it again next season if he were to remain with Atalanta.",
      "However, it’s unclear what the response has been from his agent to the approach from United.",
      "According to reports, Manchester United head coach Ruben Amorim has made a decision on his “favourite” option to replace one of his current starters.",

      "A Manchester United player has reportedly played a role in stopping his club getting hijacked for a star forward, who they will bid again for soon.",
      "Ruben Amorim has now decided he ‘trusts’ the supposedly ‘sentenced’ Man Utd star to ‘redeem himself with a more solid structure’ rather than signing a replacement.",
      "According to reports, Manchester United have been forced to hatch a new ‘plan’ as they look to replace current No.1 Andre Onana."

      "Manchester United are reportedly ringing an elite goalkeeper ‘every day’ in the hopes that he’ll choose them over a move to Atletico Madrid.",
      "United are in the market for a new goalkeeper after Andre Onana had a poor season last time out. The Cameroon international was at fault for three goals the Red Devils conceded in the Premier League last season, and more in other competitions.",
      "He has been given more than enough chances over the past couple of season, and United now want to go in another direction.",
      "They have been heavily linked with Aston Villa’s Emi Martinez of late, and it’s been suggested that a move for the Argentina international is progressing.",
      "It has been suggested for a short while that Martinez wants to sign for United, having said yes if Onana is to leave, per a report, which also states there’s been ‘positive feedback’ over a move for the keeper, who wants to leave Villa.",
      "But that Martinez wants to head to United has been thrown up in the air.",
      "A report from Football Insider suggests the Red Devils are ‘ringing every day’ to get a deal over the line in the coming weeks, as it’s believed Villa don’t have long before they need to sell Martinez due to PSR pressures.",
      "But the twist is that it’s believed Martinez actually wants to go to Atletico Madrid. They and United are said to be the leading candidates, but the Spanish side is his ‘preference’ as he’d like to play under Diego Simeone.",
      "There is said to be a fear at the Metropolitano about losing Jan Oblak, given the goalkeeper – who has played 494 times for Atletico – is the subject of interest from the Saudi Pro League.",
      "Given a lot of reports have suggested that Martinez wants to go to United, there is seemingly confusion over where he actually wants to end up.",
      "Atletico have the pull of Champions League football, while United will not play any European football at all next season, so there is certainly good reason for Martinez to want to move to the Spanish side and not the Red Devils.",
      "If Villa are indeed planning to sell before June 30, when the books have to be finalised, then there will seemingly be an answer over where Martinez will end up at very soon.",

      "Arsenal, Liverpool and Manchester United are all expected to sign a new striker this summer. Here are the 10 best available.",
      "",
      "10) Darwin Nunez (Liverpool)\nYou may question whether Darwin Nunez even deserves a place in this top 10. Statistics are not in his favour, but we wanted to include him and know he is available this summer. The only players we feel harsh leaving out are Mateo Retegui, Loic Openda and Randal Kolo Muani. And then you’ve got more debatably ‘available’ players like Alexander Isak.",
      "The Liverpool striker is an enigma. He is Captain Chaos. We love him – but for all the wrong reasons. Who in their right mind will be brazen enough to take him on? Napoli, it would seem. He’ll almost certainly move abroad, and La Liga or Serie A feels right.",
      "Darwin is still just 25, but 40 goals in 142 Liverpool games leaves a lot to be desired. Whoever signs him is taking a risk, but the potential reward is big. If someone can polish the rough edges, there’s a talented boy in there. Somewhere. We think.",
      "MORE: Transfer rumour power ranking: Liverpool eye England star as Mbeumo race tightens…",
      "",
      "9) Cristiano Ronaldo (Al Nassr)\nThe big dog Cristiano Ronaldo is out of contract at Al Nassr this summer and after rumours of an exit, chances are he will sign a new deal.",
      "He’s won absolutely nothing of note out there, but that hasn’t stopped him scoring 93 goals in 105 games. Bobbins league or not, that’s very good.",
      "A return to the Premier League is, of course, pure fantasy. But a free transfer to Al Hilal to chase trophies in the Middle East feels entirely on brand. The most shameless move of the window might still belong to Cristiano.",
      "",
      "8) Ollie Watkins (Aston Villa)\nThere was an offer from Arsenal in January that was incredibly ill-timed as Aston Villa had just agreed to sell Jhon Duran, but both club and player would likely be interested if the Gunners returned again.",
      "The problem? Watkins is now 29, which puts him firmly in the undesirable camp in modern football. But he does guarantee Premier League goals, delivering double figures in each of his last five seasons. If he’s patient, he might be the beneficiary of a late panic.",
      "",
      "7) Dusan Vlahovic (Juventus)\nDusan Vlahovic turned down Arsenal for Juventus in 2022, and it’s hard to fault him; it looked like the right call at the time. But hindsight is cruel and Arsenal are going a lot better than the Old Lady.",
      "Things haven’t quite clicked for the Serbian in Turin. A goal every three games is fine, but not what you expect from a £70million signing. Juventus are reportedly open to selling, though swap deals seem to be their go-to route.",
      "It’s tough to pin down his next move. He’s good enough to start for a big club, but not quite good enough to justify a bidding war. Vlahovic’s future might be the most unpredictable on this list.",
      "",
      "6) Victor Boniface (Bayer Leverkusen)\nWith Xabi Alonso gone, Leverkusen are braced for a summer exodus. Victor Boniface could be part of that.",
      "Boniface was reportedly close to joining Al Nassr in January but they went for Jhon Duran instead, so there is clearly an openness on Leverkusen’s side to sell, while the player is happy to take on a new challenge.",
      "The Nigerian’s stock was at its peak during Leverkusen’s unbeaten Bundesliga run in 2023/24, but he’s still a hugely viable option for big European sides. He shouldn’t be vanishing into the Saudi wilderness just yet, regardless of how many zeroes are on the cheque.",
      "",
      "5) Jonathan David (Lille)\nJonathan David is available on a free transfer after confirming he’ll leave Lille this summer, making him one of the biggest bargains out there – if he drops his reportedly ridiculous wage demands.",
      "He’s scored 109 goals in 232 games for Lille, including 10 in 18 Champions League appearances. Those numbers, plus the lack of a transfer fee, make him extremely appealing.",
      "Unfortunately, it’s mostly Saudi clubs who can meet his current terms – which include €15m in commissions. If he gets realistic, there’s a brilliant forward here for someone in need.",
      "",
      "4) Hugo Ekitike (Eintracht Frankfurt)\nNewcastle United tried to sign Hugo Ekitike from Stade Reims before he joined Paris Saint-Germain, only to flop disastrously in the French capital while the Magpies soared into the Champions League with Alexander Isak leading the line. It worked out okay for the latter but Ekitike’s time in Paris was miserable.",
      "Ekitike reportedly blocked PSG’s attempts to sign Randal Kolo Muani by refusing to go the other way – then eventually went to Frankfurt anyway, where he’s been a revelation and will make them a lot of money.",
      "After scoring 22 goals and providing 12 assists in 48 matches for Frankfurt this season, he is being strongly linked with Manchester United.",
      "Ekitike is a unique striker with a very high ceiling. Like Sesko, his height makes him a problem for any defender when it’s combined with such pace and power. Given he’s already been at PSG and flopped, a move to the Premier League feels likely. We’re not ruling out Juventus, though.",
      "",
      "3) Benjamin Sesko (RB Leipzig)\nTrying to predict Benjamin Sesko’s future is pointless. He could be world-class, or he could disappear into a Chelsea-shaped vortex and be playing for Wolves in 2027, with all due respect to Wolves.",
      "Still, the hype is real. And Mikel Arteta reportedly prefers him to Gyokeres. Sesko has the size, pace, and technical skill to become an elite striker – but he’s not there yet. If someone’s patient, he could end up being the best player on this entire list.",
      "",
      "2) Viktor Gyokeres (Sporting CP)\nReportedly Arsenal’s top striker target and adored by Mikel Arteta’s new sporting director Andrea Berta, Viktor Gyokeres has been red hot this year after finishing 2024 as Europe’s top scorer.",
      "Arsenal have been crying out for an out-and-out goalscorer ever since Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang left in 2022, and Gyokeres would be a smart signing. Perhaps the last piece of the puzzle that can help the Gunners win the Premier League or Champions League next season.",
      "He scored 39 goals in 33 league games last season and topped the charts in Europe across all competitions. The fact it’s in Portugal doesn’t dilute the achievement – he also got six in eight in the Champions League, including a hat-trick in a win against Manchester City that got Man United fans all giddy.",
      "Sometimes stats don’t lie and that’s the case with Gyokeres. He’s clearly just what Arteta needs. It’s now just about meeting Sporting’s price.",
      "",
      "1) Victor Osimhen (Napoli)\nIt’s bizarre how little noise there’s been around Victor Osimhen. In the last five years, there have not been many better strikers and he was the main man in Napoli’s first title-winning campaign 33 years in 2022/23. Despite his reputation, goal record and availability, there has been a real lack of interest.",
      "We are left scratching our head trying to work out why. Is it down to his attitude? It could well be. There have been some questionable things said by the player and his agent in recent years and with no big clubs seemingly interested, other big clubs are reluctant to bring him in. His wage demands could be a key factor. We all know that Napoli want to sell and at a price that is very reasonable for a player of Osimhen’s quality.",
      "A transfer to Chelsea last summer ticked all of the boxes but the Premier League club didn’t fancy it and went into the season with Nicolas Jackson as their only out-and-out striker and versatile forward Christopher Nkunku as back-up. Chelsea have now brought in Liam Delap, meaning Osimhen is unlikely to get a Premier League move that not so long ago felt inevitable.",
      "Saudi Arabia now feels the most obvious next move for Osimhen, but he reportedly wants to stay in Europe. Liverpool have been linked with a swap deal involving Darwin Nunez, which almost makes too much sense. We shall see.",
      "READ NOW: Predicting where the 12 players *definitely* leaving in the top 100 are going this summer",

      "Marcus Rashford and Manchester United will part this summer but one of his eight transfer options is even more unlikely than him staying at Old Trafford.",
      "The Manchester-born striker made his Premier League debut under Louis van Gaal in 2016 but the former fresh-faced wonderkid is surplus to requirements at Old Trafford.",
      "Having fallen out of favour with Ruben Amorim, he spent the second half of last season on loan at Aston Villa but is back in Manchester, now looking for his next move.",
      "Here’s where we reckon Rashford could end up:",
      "",
      "After some depressing final months at Old Trafford, Rashford seemed to be back enjoying football when he moved to Villa Park.",
      "He contributed to 10 goals in 17 games as he and fellow loanees Marco Asensio played a part in Villa’s run in and push for the Champions League but a return for Rashford seems unlikely for 325,000 reasons.",
      "Villa are one of the clubs thought to be under most pressure from PSR rules but it is actually UEFA’s financial laws that could cause the Birmingham club a headache.",
      "From the 2025-26 season, UEFA say only 70% of a club’s spending can be on ‘squad cost’ which is the sum of first-team and manager wages, transfer fees, agent and intermediary costs and fees paid to pay off former players/managers divided by day-to-day income, incoming transfer player and manager fees and any other transfer income.",
      "In their most recent published accounts, Villa’s overall wage bill was £252m and their revenue £257.7m. So adding Rashford with his £325,000 salary to that equation seems silly.",
      "Verdict: Incredibly unlikely",
      "",
      "If Rashford returning to Villa seems impossible, him staying at Manchester United looks just as unlikely.",
      "But with an expensive contract that runs until 2028, Rashford would be within his rights to stay at the club and take home his pay cheque.",
      "However, with a World Cup next year, Rashford will want to play so he can be part of Thomas Tuchel’s England side.",
      "Verdict: Very unlikely",
      "",
      "Having offered his services to them in January, Rashford moving to Barcelona looked a real possibility this summer but developments in the last few days seem to have put an end to it.",
      "Fabrizio Romano reported on Thursday that the Camp Nou club had agreed terms with Athletic Bilbao’s Nico Williams having long been interested in the Spain forward.",
      "The transfer, not to mention the money involved in, would see a player take up Rashford’s favoured spot, meaning his chance to move to Barcelona may have come and gone.",
      "Verdict: Unlikely",
      "If you glanced across any transfer rumour so far this summer, chances are Galatasaray have been mentioned.",
      "The Turkish side have been linked with almost every player going and reports of their interest in Rashford first emerged in November.",
      "A move to Villa cooled that link but with Rashford still on the market, Galatasaray could look to tempt him to Turkey to join a strike force which Leroy Sane will soon be a part of.",
      "Verdict: Possible",
      "",
      "Rashford need only ask Scott McTominay how a move to Italy can rejuvenate a career and Serie A has become somewhat of a rescue place for misfiring Premier League players.",
      "Of the Italian clubs, it is Inter who have been linked with the Sun suggesting the San Siro side were interested. But given it is the Sun that may well be incorrect.",
      "But wages may well be an issue. Inter’s current top earner is Lautaro Martinez on €320,000 a week, meaning Rashford’s £325,000 would make him easily the club’s best-paid player, potentially disrupting squad harmony and putting Inter under considerable financial strain.",
      "The Champions League final showed how Inter needed some younger blood to go with their experience and if they can get Rashford to drop his wages, they could make a move for him.",
      "Verdict: Possible (if Rashford drops wage demands)",
      "While the outrageous spending has curtailed somewhat, the Saudi Pro League remains a comfortable landing place for unwanted Premier League stars.",
      "To date, five English players have made the move to Saudi and Rashford may well join them if he cannot find a better move in Europe.",

Vitinha and Neves bossed the CL final and Barcelona’s seem to have an almost endless supply of Gavi’s and Pedri’s. It seems like only in the English Agricultural League where these players don’t appear to cut mustard. It’s questionable if even Paul scholes would make it in the EPL these days. And we all know that Messi wouldn’t be able to “do it” on a cold Tuesday night in Stoke!",

      "Ruben Amorim has told four “bad apples” at Manchester United that they won’t be coming on their tour of the United States in July if they haven’t already found a new club.",
      "Amorim is working hard with newly-promoted Director of Football Jason Wilcox to revamp a United squad which produced the worst season in living memory last term.",
      "Matheus Cunha has joined the club in a £62.5m move from Wolves and they’ve reportedly made an improved £60m+ bid for Brentford’s Bryan Mbeumo after their opening offer of £45m plus £10m in add-ons fell short, but a fresh report claims a transfer U-turn may see the Cameroon international ‘choose Tottenham’ for ‘obvious reasons’.",
      "It’s widely expected that United will have to make significant sales this summer in order to provide Amorim the cash to make the changes he wants and the club is working hard to find buyers for Marcus Rashford, Antony, Jadon Sancho and Alejandro Garnacho.",
      "Garnacho ended last season as the club’s second top scorer with 11 goals in all competitions, to go with ten assists, but was told by Amorim to source a new club at the end of the campaign.",
      "Napoli remain keen on the 20-year-old, whom United reportedly want £70m for, while Chelsea, Aston Villa and Tottenham are also said to be interested, but the Serie A giants may instead move for Sancho, with reports suggesting the winger has ‘verbally agreed’ to a move to Naples.",
      "Marcus Rashford has done everything possible to seal his ‘dream’ move to Barcelona, but the Catalans look set to sign Nico Williams from Athletic Club as their new left winger.",
      "Newcastle are thought to be keen on Rashford amid reports of a huge Liverpool bid for their striker Alexander Isak.",
      "There is reportedly ‘growing optimism’ from both Real Betis and Antony that he will prolong his stay with the La Liga side after his impressive return of nine goals and five assists in the second half of last season.",
      "United are said to want £34m for the Brazilian but Betis have proposed a deal which would see United claim a significant percentage of any future sale as it’s thought they can only stump up £17m as an initial payment.",
      "But Stretty News report that Antony also has admirers from the Premier League, claiming: ‘Our sources can also confirm that Aston Villa and Brentford have enquired about Antony, but the tricky winger has clearly given his preference to Betis.’",
      "The Sun claim that if any of the quartet have failed to find a new club by the time United fly to the States in July for their pre-season tour they will be left behind to train alone at Carrington.",
      "A club source said: “Amorim is stamping his authority on the club. It was hard arriving mid-season but he now has the opportunity to shape the team in his image. And he’s wasting no time.",
      "“He only wants players who would die for the shirt and are on board with his ideas.",
      "“He also wants a smaller squad to create an intimate team bond so that everyone gets enough game time to be at peak fitness when called upon. He doesn’t want any bad apples or distractions.”",
      "Ruben Amorim might finally have lost it at Manchester United; four players he is trying to sell won’t come on tour and he wants new signings fairly soon.",
      "Man Utd have lost the Europa League final, leading to calls for the end of the Ruben Amorim experiment. So who next?",
      "Manchester United chief executive Omar Berrada has confirmed their “target” date to win the Premier League amid his surprise at Ruben Amorim’s dire start.",
      "Ruben Amorim has now decided he ‘trusts’ the supposedly ‘sentenced’ Man Utd star to ‘redeem himself with a more solid structure’ rather than signing a replacement.",

      "MORE: Martinez need not act the d*** if he’s Man Utd’s pick to replace oblivious Onana",
      "Onana is attracting interest from Saudi Arabia and United will cash in if a suitable offer arrives, though they are prioritising other areas over the goalkeeper position.",

      "He’s definitely ‘not untouchable’, though, and will be sold if a ‘good proposal for all parties’ arrives.",
      "Romano says:",
      "Saudi Pro League clubs maintain interest in Onana and that’s a potential scenario. No proposal has arrived on Man United’s table yet, but this story could develop later this summer and so the club is maintaining a close eye on opportunities for the goalkeeper position in case anything changes with regard to Onana’s future.",
      "Torino goalkeeper Vanja Milinkovic-Savic has been on United’s shortlist since March and is another option being considered by Sir Jim Ratcliffe’s transfer team.",
      "However, there has been ‘positive feedback’ internally that gives the green light for a move for Martinez.",
      "There have been ‘initial contacts’, and the 32-year-old reportedly ‘wants to leave Aston Villa’ after an emotional farewell on the penultimate Premier League weekend.",

      "From a 38-year-old Jamie Vardy teaching Rasmus Hojlund how to finish, to Ben Mee returning to Burnley, we’ve reassigned 10 players released by Premier League clubs to new homes.",
      "",
      "Jamie Vardy to Manchester United\nIan Watson wrote at length about Vardy to United and here we are, banging that drum again. Does it make sense? Yes, it kind of does. And Watto is a United fan, so…",
      "Vardy is 38, which makes him very much a signing for the present, and a one-year deal is surely the only sensible option for the Red Devils. We’re not saying he has to be signed and given the No.9 shirt. No, he’d take on a Jonny Evans-like role, mentoring the rather hopeless-looking Rasmus Hojlund into a proper fox in the box, turning Joshua Zirkzee into an actual No.9, and helping Matheus Cunha score even more goals.",
      "The only natural striker Ruben Amorim has right now is Hojlund, a £70million investment United surely aren’t ready to chuck in the bin for a shiny new toy. Having already missed out on Liam Delap, United need a cost-effective striker who can relieve some pressure on Hojlund’s still-young shoulders.",
      "The more we talk about and justify this transfer, the more sense it makes. It surely won’t happen…but never say never.",
      "",
      "Kyle Walker-Peters to Aston Villa\nWhen Southampton were relegated in 2023, Walker-Peters stayed to help them bounce back, despite being primed for a move to a top-flight club with his stock as high as it had ever been. Two years on, the Saints are going down again, this time without the 28-year-old, whose stock has dipped but who’s available on a free, which will convince someone he’s worth a punt.",
      "The two-cap England international is in his prime and has proven he can play both right- and left-back. That sort of versatility should land him a decent move. There were so many options that we eventually settled on Aston Villa.",
      "Is that because he ended up there on my Football Manager save? Maybe a smidgen. But Matty Cash is easily upgradeable, and Walker-Peters could well leapfrog him in Unai Emery’s right-back pecking order.",
      "",
      "Christian Eriksen to Everton\nDavid Moyes likes his defensive midfielders to be, well, defensive, but gives players like Iliman Ndiaye licence to roam. Eriksen does not have Ndiaye’s agility or dynamism, but his technical ability remains outstanding, and he’d be a real asset offensively.",
      "His days as a Premier League starter are behind him, but Eriksen still offers a superb creative spark off the bench. He created 2.63 chances from open play per 90 in the 2024/25 Premier League; only Bruno Fernandes, Bukayo Saka and Kevin De Bruyne created more.",
      "One simple thing Moyes changed when replacing Sean Dyche was the volume of through balls his players attempted, which made Everton more dangerous on the break. It’s just a shame Beto so often lacked composure and finesse.",
      "",
      "Victor Lindelof to Wolves\nLike Walker-Peters, this one almost involved drawing names out of a hat. Bournemouth were our first pick, then Everton were considered (they do love a United cast-off), and then we looked at the promoted trio of Burnley, Leeds and Sunderland. In the end, we landed on Wolves.",
      "They’re set to lose Craig Dawson and are severely lacking quality at centre-back, so Vitor Pereira could do a lot worse than a player who spent eight years at United looking a bit out of his depth.",
      "Lindelof wasn’t dreadful, but far from excellent. He was painfully average – which shouldn’t be enough at United, but often is these days.",
      "The Swede just screams Turkish Super Lig, so we’re half-expecting that move. We’re just not sure if he’s more Besiktas or Trabzonspor.",

      "Abdoulaye Doucoure to Sunderland\nDoucoure leaves Everton as a cult hero and deserving of a new adventure at 32.",
      "The ex-Watford midfielder is another very Turkish Super Lig-type, and we also see the appeal of Saudi Arabian and Qatari riches. But we’d love him to stay in the Premier League as the under-rated sh*thouse that he is.",
      "Sunderland need to replace Jobe Bellingham, and Doucoure would be a smart option. Leeds have also been linked, and again…we like it.",
      "",
      "Ben Mee to Burnley\nThe sentiment is off the charts, folks. An emotional return to Turf Moor would tug at the heartstrings of even the most cynical football fan.",
      "Mee spent 11 years at Burnley and, let’s be honest, that’s doing some very heavy lifting here. But the Clarets clearly need a different transfer approach to the one that got them relegated in 2023/24. Vincent Kompany splurged on foreign youngsters and – shock – it didn’t work.",
      "Mee would be a shrewd addition for a defensively sound side looking to maintain their stinginess in the top flight. For what it’s worth, we’re giving Scott Parker until November.",

Fans will be happy to see the back of both – Keane because he’s been rubbish, Calvert-Lewin because he’s always injured.",
      "The latter’s injury record means no one will sign him as a first-choice striker, but when fit, Calvert-Lewin is a real handful and a very solid all-round No.9.",
      "So we’ve picked a club who need depth up front and have better options already: West Ham.",
      "Graham Potter has lost Evan Ferguson after his loan ended, and with Michail Antonio out of contract and in talks over a new deal (more out of respect after that car crash and broken leg than anything else), there’s a squad spot going.",

      "‘Spurs are very much still in the reckoning for the forward, but he is one of many options they have on their list of targets’, the report states.",
      "Mbeumo was full of praise for Frank when it was announced the Danish boss was leaving Brentford.",
      "“And even collectively, I think we did play very good games. I think we’ve been unlucky to chase the Europe spot, but I think it’s been a fantastic season.",
      "“[Thomas Frank] has done so much for me. He literally trusted me from the start. I think he developed the team so well. He developed me as a human and a player as well. So I can only wish him all the best, and I’m sure he’s going to do well.",
      "“I think he knows everything. He’s really smart. He knows where he wants to bring the team, how he wants to play. I think he’s been fantastic for Brentford.”",

      "Onana’s position was safe before the season as he grew into his debut year at Old Trafford, but his situation has drastically changed over the past season as it’s been widely reported that he is set to be replaced.",
      "Earlier this week, a report suggested Aston Villa star Emiliano Martinez has ‘offered himself’ to Man Utd as he’s keen on a move to Old Trafford, while Unai Emery’s side are open to an exit as they look to avoid a breach of the Premier League’s Profit and Sustainability rules.",

      "“He’s got the presence to play for Manchester United. And he’s very confident,” Heskey claimed.",
      "“Whoever goes into Man United, you have to have some serious presence. You have to have some serious belief in yourself. And I think he’s got that because the pressure is going to be on from day dot, because when you look at Onana, his confidence is on the floor.",
      "“Whoever comes in next, they have to hit the ground running. Emi is an interesting character, and you’d need to be that to take on a challenge like United right now.",
      "“He’s probably the closest goalkeeper in attitude to Fabien Barthez, and you need that. It’s a huge club, absolutely massive. He’s won the World Cup, he’s played with Lionel Messi, so he’s well suited as far as we can tell.",
      "“We won’t know for sure until and unless he moves, because we’ve seen goalkeepers crumble in minutes, like Massimo Taibi, with the pressure of United. They make a few mistakes and then you never see them again.",
      "“The only reason that’s not happened to Onana yet is because their other keepers are no better than him. If you can’t look to your number two at all to take the pressure off, then there’s a huge issue there.”",

Although he hasn’t submitted a formal request to leave, he has made it clear that if he loses prominence in the coming months, he will seriously consider his future. The situation has generated tension within the Barcelona team.’",

      "Because while in general it remains open to debate whether you’d prefer a tough start and easier run-in or vice versa, when it comes to sorting out which manager might be the first one sent packing, there is a clear preference.",
      "So let’s rank the whole lot of them – minus Brentford, on the surely reasonable basis that we don’t know who their manager will actually be – on how likely (or otherwise) they are to win the race that nobody wants to win.",
      "And here are possible replacement managers currently between jobs.",
      "",
      "19) Arne Slot (Liverpool)\nThere is still a tiny part of our brain that remains stubbornly convinced Liverpool are going to completely f*ck it next season. It is based on essentially nothing, but it sits there nagging at us and just won’t go away.",
      "Most of our brain thinks they probably won’t f*ck it and might even be better than last season, but even that tiny idiot part convinced of pending disaster doesn’t think it could possibly materialise quickly or dramatically enough for Slot to be in any kind of danger before at least one other poor sod has been put out of his misery somewhere.",
      "",
      "18) Eddie Howe (Newcastle)\nAt various points we’ve expended daft amounts of energy attempting to manifest a ‘Howe Sack’ crisis because we’re messy bitches who live for drama. But we’ve never managed to make it stick even a tiny bit and there’s essentially no chance now with Howe the hero of the Geordie Nation for delivering silverware and more lovely, lovely Champions League football.",
      "But worry not; we’ll be back on the case in November, with the same total lack of impact, after a run of two draws and a defeat leaves the Magpies six points outside the top five.",
      "",
      "17) Andoni Iraola (Bournemouth)\nAmong the least sackable managers in the top flight, and the only club we could really picture trying to lure him away this summer was Spurs and that’s now safely off the table.",
      "A big overseas move can’t be entirely ruled out, but we’re still very much in rank outsider territory here.",
      "",
      "16) Unai Emery (Aston Villa)\nMissing out on the Champions League in the manner they did was definitely a p*sser, and while Villa were perfectly good last season, it was one that felt a bit flat in the end. It was good, but it could have been great. They could have finished in the top five. They could have won the FA Cup. They could even have knocked out PSG.",
      "These annoyances are real and meaningful, but hard to see how they could possibly translate to Emery being in anything like the sort of bother that put him at risk of being out on his ear in the early months of next season.",
      "",
      "15) Marco Silva (Fulham)\nWon’t be sacked, but could be poached with bigger beasts definitely paying attention. And if that poaching comes from outside the Premier League, then it comes with the possibility of making Silva the first Premier League managerial casualty. But still very unlikely.",
      "",
      "14) Oliver Glasner (Crystal Palace)\nSee Marco Silva.",
      "",
      "13) Thomas Frank (Tottenham)\nCould it go very wrong very quickly? Absolutely yes. Thomas Frank is a good coach and seems a decent chap, but none of us really know how he’ll operate outside the very specific environment he had at Brentford.",
      "Spurs’ environment is… not like that one. He’s going to have a big job on to sort out an awful lot of mess at history’s funniest ever Champions League qualifiers.",
      "But while the Nuno comparisons are obvious, and a world in which Frank doesn’t make the November international break entirely possible, it doesn’t quite feel like the same situation.",
      "Crucially, there has been no undignified scramble to find a new manager this time. Whatever your thoughts on the timing and manner of Ange Postecoglou’s sacking and the identity of his replacement, it’s also clear Spurs have got the man they wanted in a way they very obviously didn’t when Nuno came in.",
      "That surely buys Frank a bit of time even if things do get hairy. Enough at least for someone else to get canned before he does. Probably.",
      "",
      "12) David Moyes (Everton)\nThings would have to go unbelievably wrong unbelievably fast, but this is Everton so, you know. Maybe. And there are few things that straddle the blessing-curse divide in football quite like a new stadium.",
      "The benefits Everton should accrue come in the long term. In the short term there’s the loss of familiarity and – something that feels specifically important in this particular case – atmosphere while everyone gets used to the new surroundings.",
      "Not hard to imagine a world in which Everton don’t make a flying start, but pretty hard to picture one in which that leads to a brutal early axe-wielding.",
      "",
      "11) Pep Guardiola (Man City)\nA sacking remains out of the question despite last season’s (relative) struggles. There hasn’t been a Premier League manager since Fergie in his pomp with more credit in the bank than Pep.",
      "But is there still a distinct chance Guardiola decides he’s had enough and simply walks away? We reckon there is, and it’s always worth remembering that we’re talking First Premier League Manager To Leave here, and that the traditional ‘Sack Race’ shorthand is a bit misleading. Doesn’t matter how they leave, just that they do. And Pep absolutely might.",
      "",
      "10) Fabian Hurzeler (Brighton)\nFine end to 24/25 put a different complexion on Brighton’s season than at one time appeared likely. Ending up a clear best of the rest outside the quickly established top seven represented at least a passing grade and they’d have to make a truly awful start to the season to get in any kind of managerial-change bother.",
      "And Brighton don’t make awful starts. They are the Anti-Wolves: they start really well and then fade a bit. Which can be annoying, but is definitely the right way round to do it if you’re a manager trying not to get sacked.",
      "",
      "9) Vitor Pereira (Wolves)\nAs we said, Wolves absolutely love a sh*tbone awful start and enforced managerial change around November. The loss of key players and a disappointingly limp finish to last season after that thrilling run of wins through March and April mean those old doubts nag away.",
      "Pereira should be fine after the work he did in steering Wolves so comfortably clear of any relegation trouble last season, but making terrible starts that leave them in apparent relegation trouble before surviving comfortably in the end appears to now be ingrained in the club culture, an issue that transcends players and managers.",
      "",
      "8) Enzo Maresca (Chelsea)\nOne of the key early-season imponderables for 25/26 is just how big and what kind of impact the Club World Cup has on the way Chelsea and Man City start the season. Does the fact they’ve got plenty of (semi-) competitive games in their legs give them an early boost? Or will they just be knackered and given the runaround by fresher legs?",
      "Dunno, so it’s into mid-table Maresca must slot. He definitely still has some hearts and minds to win at Chelsea despite the fine finish to the season that saw them tick off Champions League qualification while completing their collection of UEFA pots and pans.",
      "A slow start and whispers will begin.",
      "",
      "7) Ruben Amorim (Manchester United)\nFeels like one could, if one were so inclined, make the case for him being top of this list but also bottom.",
      "Top because United were staggeringly and at times unwatchably bad last season, as well as bottling the Europa League final in truly dismal fashion against planet earth’s most notorious pot-dodgers. Bottom because United have so clearly and determinedly nailed their colours to the Amorim mast that even if they remain staggeringly and at times unwatchably awful they might just stick with him out of pure stubbornness.",
      "What you may notice we’ve cleverly avoided here is any attempt at predicting what we actually think Man United will actually do next season in terms of being good/bad/indifferent. And that’s because we genuinely have not one clue. Could be anything, couldn’t they?",
      "READ: Who will be the next Man Utd manager if Ruben Amorim is sacked?",
      "",
      "6) Mikel Arteta (Arsenal)\nProbably the hardest manager of all to place as he prepares to lead The Best Team In Europe™ through their Nightmare Start.",
      "While we have no desire to get remotely involved in any of the daft conspiracy-based bumwash spewing forth from the more chronically online corners of the Arsenal fanbase, there is no denying there are teams with easier starts out there.",
      "Not many with easier run-ins, like, but the thing with an easier run-in is that unless we experience a very strange season indeed, that is not a particularly relevant piece of information from a Sack Race stance.",
      "Do we really think Arteta could or should be the first manager out the door once the season begins? No. But it’s unavoidably true that if that Nightmare Start goes they way it might then the title could already look out of reach by October and that will generate inevitable noise and hot air.",
      "It’s far likelier that Arsenal emerge blinking into the autumn sunshine largely unscathed from their nightmare horrors, but again, that doesn’t really matter for our purposes. Arteta’s is a quirky situation where the range of possible outcomes is such that he sits uncommonly prominently in this list but would be even closer to the top of any possible manager of the year list.",
      "READ: Who will be the next manager of Arsenal if Mikel Arteta is sacked?",
      "",
      "5) Nuno Espirito Santo (Nottingham Forest)\nNot remotely as safe as he should be, really. The harsh reality of just how high Forest flew for much of last season meant the way it ended with ‘only’ Europa Conference qualification has to be classed as a disappointment, and there was more than one reminder along the way that for all that has gone well for Forest over the last couple of years their owner remains very loose indeed and absolutely capable of doing a madness if Forest start next season as they ended this one.",
      "We’re not joking, either. If Forest have eight points after eight games, Nuno could absolutely be in deep doo-doo. There’s also the added early-season headache of those Conference League qualifiers, too, which none of our other European entrants have to worry themselves with.",
      "",
      "4) Graham Potter (West Ham)\nReally interesting one, is Potter. Feels like one of those with the widest possible spectrum of possible outcomes.",
      "If a time traveller from next May inexplicably used those physics-destroying, existence-endangering powers to come back and tell you about West Ham’s 25/26 season, you would not bat an eye at discovering they had finished seventh after flirting with a Champions League spot for several months, or that Potter had been sacked in October after a 1-0 defeat at Leeds left them 19th in the table and four adrift of safety.",
      "Now that’s in part because you’d mainly be trying to get your head around the sheer reckless pointlessness of that idiotic time traveller, but still. There are definitely a lot of managers we think are much less likely than Potter to last the whole season, but also not that many who are more likely to be the first to get the tin tack. As with Arteta – perhaps even more so – what we’re doing here isn’t quite as straightforward as ‘do you think this manager will do well or what’.",
      "You really do never quite know what you’re going to get from West Ham, a club who are far Spursier than they or indeed Spurs would care to concede.",
      "",
      "3) Daniel Farke (Leeds)\nIt would have made Spurs’ decision to sack Europa League-winning Ange Postecoglou look positively kind, but there remains a decent case that Leeds – and Burnley for that matter – could or even should have thanked the managers who secured 100 Championship points and got them back into the big time and then sent them on their way.",
      "Farke has a dreadful Premier League record of only six wins and 26 points from his 49 games in charge of Norwich, a team he twice led to promotion from the Championship with 94 and 97 points.",
      "As well as fighting his own record in this competition, Farke faces the added burden of expectation levels very different to those at just about any other club that could possibly find itself promoted into the Premier League.",
      "He lasted 11 games of the 21/22 season with Norwich and something similar absolutely cannot be ruled out this time.",
      "",
      "2) Regis Le Bris (Sunderland)\nRarely if ever has a manager looked more utterly doomed to ‘victim of his own success’ status than Le Bris, having foolishly got Sunderland promoted by mistake at least a year early.",
      "They finished 24 points behind the top two in last season’s Championship and won fewer than half their matches before pulling Sheffield United’s pants down in the play-off final.",
      "Sunderland appear to be the next – and by no means last – team who will begin a Premier League season with their first main target being just to get past Derby.",
      "They’ll probably do that, but it probably won’t be with Le Bris in charge. The near total lack of expectation on Sunderland to do anything much at all and a not-too-terrifying set of August fixtures is really all that saves him from top spot here.",
      "",
      "1) Scott Parker (Burnley)\nWe’ve said what we’ve said about the futility of fixture-list doom-mongery, about how second-guessing teams this far out is a fool’s errand. But Burnley really do have a horrible start under a manager with a horrible record at this level.",
      "Sure, we can’t possibly know with any great confidence whether Spurs and Man United are going to be better than last year or whether Nottingham Forest will be worse, but Burnley’s early home clash with Sunderland already looks an absolutely vital source of potential early-season respite.",
      "Because that game aside, Burnley have to deal with Spurs, United, Liverpool, Forest, City and Villa before the first weekend of October is out. And Parker may well be too, ideally after a 9-0 defeat against Liverpool that he regards as unavoidable.",
      "We’re also very unconvinced Parker’s new pragmatic approach that got Burnley up will be any more effective at this elevated level than those who attempt to run before they can walk, like your Vincent Kompanys or Russell Martins.",
      "There are three Italians at the top of the betting to be the next Arsenal manager after Mikel Arteta. It’s an intriguing list.",
      "According to reports, Arsenal have been dealt a major blow as head coach Mikel Arteta is ‘set’ to lose a key member of his staff in a ‘record’ deal.",
      "Premier League runners-up Arsenal have been told it would be “crazy” to spend £85m on a player who is unproven in the Premier League this summer.",
      "The Premier League’s top two will have to keep their options open when it comes to acquiring a new striker in the summer transfer window.",
      "Arsenal have now pulled out of a deal to sign Viktor Gyokeres after making a £59m bid for the Sporting CP striker earlier this week, according to reports.",
      "Real Sociedad midfielder Martin Zubimendi is waiting to undergo a medical with Arsenal today ahead of completing a transfer, according to reports."

      "Morocco will host the 24-team tournament, which was originally scheduled to take place between June and July 2025 to avoid clashing with European clubs' schedules, only for the new expanded FIFA Club World Cup to put an end to those plans.",
      "As a result, it will now take place between December 21, 2025 and January 18, 2026, earlier than the 2023 tournament that happened between January and February 2024 due to the final two league games in the new enlarged Champions League being scheduled for January 20-21 and 28 next year.",

      "The forward contributed an incredible 29 goals and 18 assists to help Arne Slot's side win the 2024/25 Premier League and given he suffered a debilitating hamstring injury while playing for Egypt at the 2023/24 AFCONs that seriously impacted Liverpool's title challenge that season, Reds head coach Arne Slot will be praying his star man comes back fit from Morocco.",
      "Either way, the 33-year-old could miss these top-flight fixtures - depending on how far Egypt go in the tournament [they were knocked out at the round-of-16 stage in 2024] - including a potentially defining clash at last season's runners-up Arsenal:",

      "Tuesday 17 June 2025 10:54, UK",
      "Manchester United chief executive Omar Berrada remains confident the club can mark their 150th anniversary in 2028 by winning both the men’s and women’s league titles and believes there are similarities between head coach Ruben Amorim and Man City boss Pep Guardiola.",
      "Berrada, who first told staff of his \"Project 150\" vision in September last year, knows that represents a significant challenge with United having just endured a worst top-flight season since relegation in 1973-74, while Chelsea continue to dominate the Women's Super League.",
      "However, he believes marking a major milestone in the club's history since it was founded as Newton Heath in 1878 with double title success is realistic.",
      "In an interview with the United We Stand fanzine to be published on Wednesday, Berrada said: \"It's establishing a series of targets within a timeframe so we can focus our efforts and energy on that goal.",
      "\"Can the team win the Premier League title by 2028? Of course.",
      "\"We've just finished 15th and it seems an impossible task. But why not aim for it? Why not do everything in our power?\"",
      "While United finished third in the WSL, 16 points behind champions Chelsea who also beat them in the FA Cup final, the men languished just three places above the Premier League relegation zone and lost the Europa League final to Tottenham.",
      "Nevertheless, Berrada has doubled down on his timetable.",
      "He said: \"I firmly believe we can do it.",
      "\"We have two or three summer windows to build a team to start competing to win the Premier League.",
      "\"Nobody is saying we don't want to win it until then. We're setting ourselves a target with a specific time frame to go and aim for.\"",
      "Berrada also reaffirmed Man Utd's commitment to women's football.",
      "\"We have been a bit distracted with all the issues around the men's first team but we are committed to making the women's team very successful,\" said Berrada.",
      "\"You've heard [minority owner] Jim [Ratcliffe] say 'if you're wearing the United shirt then you must win'. That's exactly how I feel. A club of our scale has a responsibility to grow football in general and contribute to women's football.\"",
      "Amorim has had a difficult start to life at Old Trafford since arriving from Sporting in November.",
      "And Berrada, who joined United after leaving his role as chief football operations officer at City Football Group, believes there are similarities between Amorim and Man City boss Guardiola, who had his own struggles in his first season at the Etihad.",
      "\"Very much so,\" Berrada said when asked if saw similarities between Amorim and Guardiola.",
      "\"It was difficult in Pep's first year.\"",
      "He added: \"He didn't win anything and there was suspicion about whether he could implement his football vision in the Premier League. People said he was arrogant and wouldn't change his style of play. But he stuck to his principles and given what he'd won, he had an enormous amount of credit in the bank.",
      "\"He was allowed that first year to be below-par by his standards. The club backed him that summer, the team started winning and created this winning cycle that lasted until this season.\"",
      "Berrada believes the difficulties Amorim has had to deal with will benefit the head coach and the club next season.",
      "\"It won't be easy,\" he said. \"There'll be some difficult moments ahead.",
      "\"Nothing is going to get solved with one summer window, but we are on the right path.",
      "\"We've put the worst part of this transformation phase behind us and now we're going to start building. I'm very confident we'll get back to the top.\"",
