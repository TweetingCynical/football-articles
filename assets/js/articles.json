      "Former Manchester United star Owen Hargreaves has claimed that Wayne Rooney was one of the hardest workers he's ever played with. The ex-England star's comments fly in the face of the remarks made by NFL legend Tom Brady, who recently criticised Rooney's work ethic.",
      "Rooney was given the boot by Birmingham City, where Brady is a part-owner, after just 83 disastrous days in charge in January 2024. The seven-time Super Bowl champion questioned Rooney's application to his position as manager in a documentary that followed Brady's involvement with Birmingham.",
      "Following a visit to the club's training ground in November 2023, Brady let slip that he was \"a little worried about our head coach's work ethic\". While Rooney has responded to the comments himself, he has been backed by Hargreaves, who played with Rooney at United from 2007-2011.",
      "Speaking on That Peter Crouch podcast, the ex-Bayern Munich star was asked who was better in training out of Cristiano Ronaldo and Rooney, with the Liverpudlian remarkably just edging it over the player who's regarded as one of the greatest of all time.",
      "\"What a great question,\" Hargreaves began. \"I'm sure Cristiano would disagree but Wazza [Rooney] was insane. Peak Wazza. Prime Wazza was like a hybrid, he was crazy.\"",
      "Addressing Brady's claims in August, on his self-titled podcast, Rooney slammed the comments as \"unfair. He said \"I think Tom came in once, which was the day before a game where the days are a little bit lighter anyway, and I don't think he really understood football that well.",
      "\"But what he does understand is, he's a hard worker, we know that. Football is not NFL – NFL works for three months a year. Players do need rest as well, so I think he's very unfair, the way he's come out and portrayed that.\"",
      "Knighthead Capital Management LLC launched a takeover of Birmingham back in June 2023. Brady joined two months later, and just four months on, the new ownership replaced manager John Eustace with Rooney.",
      "However, Rooney's spell was ill-fated to say the least. He lasted just 15 matches before being sacked with the team 20th in the table.",
      "\"When I went into Birmingham, they were in a mess really,\" said Rooney on his stint. \"Hence the fact that the players weren't really the players who could take the club forward.\"",
      "Four managers, including Tony Mowbray, stepped in with little success before Chris Davies was later installed as head coach. The Blues finished top of League One in 2024-25 under Davies, earning promotion to the Championship.",
      "Despite the former New England Patriots star's harsh critique, Rooney chose to remain diplomatic rather than hit back at the star.",
      "\"Listen, I respect Tom Brady massively,\" said Rooney. \"He's one of the greatest, if not the greatest athletes of all time and Birmingham do look like they're getting it right now, which is good and I think what they have done is got the players out that they needed to get out.\"",

      "Rasmus Hojlund has backed fellow Manchester United loanee Marcus Rashford after both players enjoyed triumphant weekends away from their parent club. A day before the United lost the Manchester Derby, Hojlund netted 14 minutes into his Napoli debut after beating long-serving former United goalkeeper David de Gea.",
      "Then, hours after United suffered a 3-0 defeat to Manchester City, Rashford featured for Barcelona in their 6-0 thrashing of Valencia, setting up the second goal. That assist marked his first for the club in a competitive fixture after he became the first member of the United 'bomb squad' to leave earlier in the summer.",
      "Hojlund, whose side beat Fiorentina 3-1, was amongst several United players - past and present - who liked the social media post. United captain Bruno Fernandes and Tyrell Malacia were among the current squad to do so.",
      "Other out-on-loan players Ethan Wheatley and Joe Hugill, who are due to spend this season with Northampton Town and Barnet respectively, also did so. Also showing support were Aaron Wan-Bissaka, De Gea, Donny van de Beek, Jesse Lingard and Shola Shoretire.",
      "Several of those also interacted with a post from Hojlund after his debut. \"First day at the new job didn't disappoint,\" the caption reads. \"Love it mate,\" chimed in Harry Maguire, while Antony responded with a flurry of applause emojis.",
      "The post was also liked by a host of other football stars including Ayden Heaven, Bryan Mbeumo, Diogo Dalot, Fernandes, Godwill Kukonki, Hugill, Joshua Zirkzee, Kobbie Mainoo, Leny Yoro, Mason Mount, Matheus Cunha, Matthijs de Ligt, Patrick Dorgu, Rashford, Rhys Bennett and Wheatley.",
      "Ex-players Christian Eriksen, Mason Greenwood, Sofyan Amrabat, Wan-Bissaka and Willy Kambwala also gave the post a thumbs up. Hojlund is set to return to Manchester this week as City prepare to host Napoli in their first Champions League match on Thursday.",
      "With United enduring their worst start to a season since 1992/93, and with pressure ramping up on Ruben Amorim, Hojlund may well be happy that - like Rashford - he left United in the summer.",
      "Napoli manager Antonio Conte was clearly delighted with Hojlund's impact on debut - and poked fun at United in his post-match press conference. \"Hojlund is only 22. We signed him from Manchester United after seeing the luck [Scott] McTominay brought us,\" Conte joked.",

      "Ruben Amorim faces the axe at Manchester United before Christmas unless he turns things around quickly. That's according to former Manchester City and Liverpool midfielder Dietmar Hamann.",
      "United have managed just four points from their opening four fixtures, marking their most dismal Premier League start since 1992/93. The Red Devils also crashed out of the Carabao Cup in an embarrassing fashion - losing 12-11 on penalties to League Two outfit Grimsby Town after a 2-2 stalemate in normal time.",
      "This follows United securing their joint-worst Premier League campaign (15th place) with their lowest-ever points haul (42) and most losses (15) since the league's inception 33 years ago.",
      "Since taking over from Erik ten Hag as United's manager - in November 2023 - Amorim's tenure has been deeply disappointing. The Portuguese has triumphed in merely eight of his 31 league encounters at the helm.",
      "However, a source close to Amorim concedes that it's incredible that his role isn't facing serious scrutiny. Hamann, on the other hand, reckons that United's patience with Amorim could run out if there isn't a swift upturn in results.",
      "In fact, Hamann has suggested that the ex-Sporting CP boss could be shown the door by Christmas, if he doesn't manage to reverse United's current slump. Speaking to Racing Tipster, Hamman stated: \"I think Ruben Amorim has got to turn things around quickly.",
      "\"There was a case to be made last season to change the manager in the summer, but they decided against it. They spent money again, bringing in Matheus Cunha and Benjamin Sesko. At some stage, you want to see improvement.",
      "\"So far, it hasn't happened. If it doesn't happen by Christmas, I'm not too sure whether he'll still be in charge.\"",
      "City had an easy ride at the Etihad Stadium, with Phil Foden netting the opener in the 18th minute before Erling Haaland bagged a brace in the second half to seal the deal for the Blues.",
      "Giving his thoughts on the match and also his Premier League record since taking the reins at United, Amorim said after the game: \"It's not a record that you should have in Manchester United.",
      "\"There are a lot of things that you have no idea what happened during these months, but I accept that. But I'm not going to change. When I want to change my philosophy, I will change.",
      "\"If not, you have to change the man. So, we'll talk about that every game, every game that we lose; 'I don't believe in that, in the system', or whatever. So, I play my way, I'm going to play my way until I want to change.\"",

      "Manchester United legend Gary Pallister reckons the club's 3-0 drubbing at the hands of neighbours Manchester City on Sunday won't spell immediate doom for Ruben Amorim. The Red Devils were comprehensively outclassed at the Etihad Stadium, with Phil Foden opening the scoring, before Erling Haaland's second-half double rubbed salt into the wounds.",
      "The result leaves United with merely one victory from their opening five fixtures across all competitions. Amorim, who took over from Erik ten Hag 10 months ago, has won just eight of his 31 Premier League outings at the helm - which gives him a dismal 26 per cent win rate.",
      "\"I think Mason was desperate to do well. I think he started [the season] okay. And then we lose them both to injuries. I think there'll be patience.",
      "\"Everybody's going to put him under the pump for sticking with the back three. It's not what a lot of teams do. And the longer it goes, and the longer we struggle with it, the more questions are going to be asked.\"",
      "Amorim's success with Sporting Lisbon, winning the Primeira Liga in two of his three full seasons in charge, and his previous work at Braga was what convinced United to appoint the 40-year-old. In Portugal, he was wedded to that three-at-the-back formation and it remains that way at Old Trafford - but to very different results.",
      "Ex-defender Pallister added: \"Whether it's in his mindset to think about playing a back four... I'd love to be a fly on the wall in the dressing room to see what the players think about it. Sometimes you can hide behind that.",
      "\"I mean, players are players. At the end of the day, you win your battles. It's you against your centre-forward. It's you against the guy in midfield. You win your personal battles.",
      "\"And if you do that, the team's probably going to get success. You can. Whether you play a back three or a back four. And the goals we conceded were probably down to individual players' mistakes.\"",

With four points from their opening four fixtures this season, United have endured their most dismal start to a Premier League campaign since 1992/93.",

Talk surrounding Amorim's future is intensifying and former City right-back Richards has provided the Portuguese boss with some crucial guidance to remedy United's troubles.",
      "\"From the studio, you have a bird's-eye view so you can see all the positions and, in the first minute, Haaland gets his chance. United grew into the game a little bit. A little bit of confidence.",
      "\"I remember saying after the United vs Arsenal game; 'I can see an improvement'. I actually thought, in aspects of the City game, Man Utd did good things. But what is crystal clear, in the middle of the park, they need more legs. I can see that, all the fans can see that, but the manager is sticking to his guns and I just don't understand it.",

You got Rodri, who actually in the first half, I didn't think he played too well, he gave the ball away too easily, but you have got legs with [Tijani] Reijnders and you got Foden playing off Haaland. You got [Jeremy] Doku coming into little pockets and you got Bernardo Silva.",

They're getting overrun in midfield and then in behind, as well. It was just a disaster... Absolute disaster.",

      "Manchester United are three times more likely to be relegated than they are to qualify for the Europa League - according to a supercomputer. The Red Devils have endured a horror start and four games in have been given a lofty 10.95 per cent chance of going down.",
      "Following defeat in the Manchester derby Ruben Amorim's side lie in 14th with four points from their first four games - their lowest total since 1992/93. It follows on from their worst ever Premier League season, which saw them finish 15th, and now even further depths are being discussed.",
      "Once a team who won league titles annually, over the past decade top-four has been the remit. But the stats at Opta have suggested that United has a 4.18 per cent chance for landing a Champions League spot and just a 0.18 per cent chance of winning the Premier League.",
      "Relegation would be scarcely believable for those at Old Trafford, especially after they yet again spent more than £200million this summer on the likes of Benjamin Sesko, Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha. But those behind all the stats insist of all the major outcomes that could happen on the red side of Manchester relegation is more than twice as likely than any qualification for European football - which is a damning reflection of the club at present.",
      "Amorim is nearing his year anniversary in the job and he has shown no sign of taking the club forward. Even in his opening few months in charge, after a December that saw United lose five times, he was forced to admit that the Red Devils were in the midst of a relegation scrap.",
      "After a loss to Newcastle last term he confessed: \"That is really clear [United are being dragged into a relegation battle] so we have to fight. It is a really difficult moment for us, one of the more difficult moments in the history of Manchester United and we have to address it with honesty.\"",
      "United will not be addressing any potential relegation fears four games into the season, even if their only win of the season came courtesy of a Bruno Fernandes penalty in stoppage time against Burnley. The loss to Manchester City gives Amorim's record more of a grim reading - and he admits it is not good enough.",

      "It was a scene reminiscent from Manchester derbies past. Phil Foden and Erling Haaland have so often been Manchester United's tormentors-in-chief on derby day, and they proved to be so yet again on Sunday as Manchester City swatted their rivals aside without ever really hitting top gear.",
      "Haaland has been an imperious force ever since he arrived on these shores in the summer of 2022, plundering goals at a remarkable rate. But even the Norwegian's outrageous returns have not been enough to maintain City's invincibility over the past 12 months, with Pep Guardiola's formerly unformidable side now mortal.",
      "City's malaise has coincided with a difficult period for Foden, the most influential figure in their title triumph in the 2023-24 campaign. The attacking midfielder was back in full flow, though, in a fixture he has revelled in down the years.",
      "And his seventh goal against Manchester United in as many games could turn out to be the most substantial yet if it acts as the prelude to a renaissance for the Manchester City academy graduate.",
      "If anyone knows that, it's Haaland. It was just 18 months ago that Foden was coronated as the Premier League's Player of the Season after driving City to a history-making fourth consecutive domestic crown. He struck up a formidable partnership with Haaland, who crowed about City's homegrown superstar after the derby. \"We need him so much,\" the striker stressed.",
      "The Foden we saw on Sunday was reminiscent of the diminutive magician that left the Premier League spellbound during City's march to four-in-a-row. When Foden is in full flight, few can match him. Even fewer can stop him, which is something Manchester United know only too well.",
      "Much has been made of how Liverpool and Arsenal have strengthened this summer while talk of City mounting a serious challenge to reclaim their crown has been subdued. But do any of their new recruits rival Foden in his pomp? If Haaland and City can continue to support Foden and coax more magic out of those boots then there's an argument that a revitalised Foden would surpass them all.",
      "“We cannot forget two seasons ago when we won the last game against West Ham. He was the key player to win the Premier League,” was the reminder from Guardiola as he waxed lyrical about Foden on Sunday.",
      "Injuries prevented him from stepping up to the mantle as City's new kingpin last season with Kevin de Bruyne abdicating the throne long before his exit was finally signed off.",
      "Foden has long been considered the natural heir to the Belgian maestro. And if that does come to pass in the coming months, then it will be far more significant than any signing Manchester City could make.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Gary Lineker has expressed his concern over the treatment of Kobbie Mainoo at Manchester United - admitting he's \"baffled\" by the youngster's lack of playing time under Ruben Amorim. Despite impressing in his brief cameo during Sunday's defeat to Manchester City, Mainoo, 20, is yet to start a Premier League match so far this season and was once again named on the bench for the clash.",
      "The England international made an impact when he was brought on in the 62nd minute, recording a 100 per cent pass success rate from his 17 attempts. He also won all three of his duels and made one successful dribble.",
      "Following his performance, some United supporters have urged Amorim to give Mainoo a starting berth against Chelsea on Saturday as they seek out only their second victory of the campaign. The Stockport-born prodigy has played just 73 minutes of top-flight football this term, having been an unused sub against Arsenal and Fulham.",
      "Ex-Leicester City and Tottenham star Lineker has now shared his thoughts on Mainoo's predicament, expressing worry about his inability to break into the United first-team. Speaking on The Rest Is Football podcast, Lineker voiced his concerns: \"It really worries me the way Kobbie Mainoo has been kind of almost dismissed, he's such an incredible young talent, local boy as well doing really well.",
      "\"I mean, I thought when he came on, he did really quite well. I don't get it. I don't know whether there's something that we don't know about or something like that, but it's slightly baffling to me.\"",
      "United were soundly defeated at the Etihad Stadium, with Erling Haaland netting twice in the second half to seal the victory for City. That came after Phil Foden's 18th-minute opener.",
      "\"They just looked so poor,\" Lineker added on United. \"One thing I would say, and in a way he knows how he wants his team to play, he might not have the players, but the one thing I would say, if you constantly tell everybody you're going to continue playing the same way, does that not make your team very easy to plan against? So, City outnumbered them in midfield. They had too many bodies for them. They couldn't cope.\"",

      "Wayne Rooney has warned under-fire Manchester United boss Ruben Amorim time is running out for him to turn the team around.",
      "United's humiliating 3-0 derby defeat at local rivals Manchester City increased the pressure on Amorim, who has won just eight of his 31 Premier League games in charge. Although United insist Amorim retains the backing of the club hierarchy, the team's next three games, against Chelsea, Brentford and Sunderland, will ultimately decide his fate.",
      "Crystal Palace boss Oliver Glasner, former England manager Gareth Southgate and USA head coach Mauricio Pochettino are among the candidates to succeed Amorim, should he go. United legend Rooney painted a bleak picture for Amorim in the wake of Sunday's derby debacle and suggested there was little evidence of the Portuguese head coach salvaging the situation.",
      "“It's hard to see how it continues,” said Rooney. “I don’t think anyone can understand and comprehend what's going on. Frankly, it's not good enough. I want to be as supportive and positive as I can be on the manager and the players.",
      "\"But it's very difficult to sit here and say we're seeing progression and at least we're seeing things that will get results in the near future. We're seeing none of that and it's very difficult. There was an image towards the end of the game where I saw the Manchester United fans leaving.",
      "“I think that's so powerful that the United fans were leaving the game. You know the game is over and I think they were very disappointed in what they were seeing. What are the patterns? What are we seeing that might improve the team moving forward?",
      "\"I think after last year, when Erik ten Hag got sacked and Ruben came in, we're hearing how they're going to play and it is going to change. I think if the manager is honest with himself, it's got worse.\"",
      "Rooney, who watched the derby in Korea with fellow former United stars after playing an exhibition match, added: “We want to support the team and the manager the best we can, but we also have to be honest, as the fans are not fools.",
      "“We have to give our honest opinion on what we’re seeing and that puts us in uncomfortable positions at times. Rio Ferdinand was out with the team in Chicago pre-season, I go to the training ground a lot with my children, and it does put us in an uncomfortable position. But we have to be honest with what we're seeing.”",

      "Ruben Amorim launched another defence of his Manchester United system and maintained he will stick to his philosophy despite the poor run of results – and it's something former Premier League winner Antonio Conte would likely back. Amorim arrived at Old Trafford last November and quickly implemented the 3-4-3 formation that had brought him huge success with Sporting CP.",
      "It has become apparent many of his United players cannot get to grips with his demands, whilst their personnel still doesn't suit certain roles. Nevertheless, the Portuguese boss has defiantly stuck by his beliefs.",
      "He's continued to state that if United want to play a different way, they will have to sack him because he will not change. He said: \"I understand and accept it is not a record you should have in Manchester United.",
      "\"There are a lot of things, you have no idea what happened during these months but I am not going to change. When I want to change my philosophy, I will change. If not, you have to change the man.\"",
      "His stance is likely to ring a chord with Conte, who delivered Premier League glory in 2017 with Chelsea in his first year. The Italian veered away from his 3-4-3 system in the opening weeks, but saw the Blues lose successive games before going back to his plan, which set them on a then record-equalling run of wins.",
      "After moving to 3-4-3 he said that the Blues \"have improved a lot in terms of our identity and confidence.\"",
      "Conte – who lifted the Serie A title with Napoli earlier this year – remains the only manager to win the Premier League title by playing with that particular set-up, but he underlined the value in sticking by your beliefs.",
      "\"When you change your system, you lose your identity and it makes it easier for other teams to beat you,\" he said previously.",
      "That ethos has been echoed by Amorim throughout his troubled tenure and the former Sporting boss maintained that his two-man midfield, which was overrun during the 3-0 loss in the Manchester derby, was not the reason they lost the game.",
      "He explained post-match: \"It’s the way you want to see the games. I saw a lot of teams playing here (at the Etihad Stadium) with five midfielders just blocking and they suffer more than us. I see a lot of games from Manchester United playing here with a lot of midfielders.\"",
      "Plenty of on-lookers, including former United players, have continued to air their gripes with the system and the players' inability to do what their head coach wants.",
      "Roy Keane said: \"You talk about the system – but the manager has come in and is sticking to his guns. He's not budging. The results, and we look at points per game, goals for, goals against – it does concern me. It's not good reading.\"",

      "Phil Foden’s header and two clinical finishes from Erling Haaland saw City ease to victory at the Etihad Stadium and claim the bragging rights. United were completely outplayed and couldn’t take some gilt-edged chances of their own to score a consolation goal.",
      "Pressure is ramping up on Amorim, who is coming up to a year in the job and has still not succeeded in stamping his identity on the team. United spent over £200million in the summer transfer window to sign Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo, Benjamin Sesko and Senne Lammens but are not seeing the benefits yet.",
      "Those results are merely a continuation of last season’s form, when United finished 15th. Four points from four games makes it the club's worst start to the season since 1992/93 and Amorim is statistically the worst manager in the Premier League since he joined on November 24.",
      "Statisticians Opta have created a league table of the 17 clubs who have been in the division since then and United sit bottom with 31 points from 31 games. That is level with Tottenham, but Spurs have a goal difference of -4 to United’s -13, putting them rock bottom.",
      "Amorim has won just eight of his 31 league matches since arriving to replace Erik ten Hag last season – and their pitiful points tally is worse than West Ham (34), Wolves (36) and Fulham (41).",
      "Unsurprisingly, Liverpool are top of this theoretical table on 68 points, ahead of Arsenal (64), Chelsea (58) and Manchester City (54).",
      "Amorim was forced to defend himself in the aftermath of another damaging defeat. “Guys, I understand that and I accept,” he said after Sunday's defeat to City. “It is not a record you should have in Manchester United. There are a lot of things - you have no idea what happened during these months - but I accept that. I am not going to change.",
      "\"When I want to change my philosophy, I will change. If not, you have to change the man. We will talk about that every game that we lose. I don't believe in that, in the system, or whatever. I believe in my way and I am going to play my way until I want to change.",
      "\"My message is that I am going to give everything. I will do everything, always thinking about what is best for the club. That was always the same message. It is not my decision, the rest (on whether United change manager). Until I am here, I will do my best. I really want to win games. I am suffering more than them.\"",

      "Marcus Rashford has delivered a five-word message after experiencing his best moment in a Barcelona shirt since his season-long loan switch from Manchester United. The 27-year-old joined Barca during the summer but had suffered a challenging start to life in Catalonia, failing to notch a goal or provide an assist in his opening three outings.",
      "Nevertheless, Rashford rose to the occasion on Sunday, delivering a superb display during Barcelona's 6-0 thrashing of Valencia. After Fermin Lopez gave Barca the lead, Rashford crafted his side's second goal, delivering a sublime cross for former Leeds United forward Raphinha to convert at the far post.",
      "It was a delivery that United supporters had grown accustomed to witnessing from Rashford, who shone against Valencia before being substituted in the 68th minute. He managed 46 touches, fashioned three opportunities, attempted two efforts, completed four ball recoveries, earned one foul and achieved an 88 per cent pass completion rate.",
      "Lopez and Raphinha both secured braces on Sunday night while Robert Lewandoski came off the bench to score twice. \"From the beginning, we showed what we wanted to do, and that's what we've seen,\" Barca manager Hansi Flick told Movistar post-match.",
      "\"Not just Fermin, everyone has fought and had fun on the pitch.\"",
      "\"The team has been fantastic in every position. The three points are perfect, and for me it's great to have to choose between Ferran [Torres] and Lewandowski.\"",
      "Rashford's success with Barcelona came just hours after United suffered another defeat to rivals Manchester City. Ruben Amorim's difficult first 10 months in charge at Old Trafford continued with Phil Foden opening the scoring and Erling Haaland bagging a brace.",
      "The 3-0 result means United are experiencing their worst start to a season in 33 years. Since arriving at Old Trafford, Amorim has won just eight of his 31 Premier League games in charge.",

There was a minute’s applause ahead of the Manchester derby at the Etihad Stadium, with both clubs putting the rivalry aside and showing their respects, with Hatton having been a big Manchester City fan.",

      "Speaking on the Gary Neville podcast, he said: “The only smile you could possibly have is around Ricky Hatton, thinking that he’s somewhere watching this game and his beloved Manchester City have won this match.",
      "\"Because to me today, I feel sick in my stomach, from the moment this morning, late morning, when that news broke through, that’s the only thing really that’s taken my mind today.",
      "“Someone who is an unbelievable Mancunian, someone who carried Manchester all around the world, to America in massive fights, he lit up the city and the arenas of the city with his boxing, someone who went in and literally fought like everything hung on it every single time, a warrior.",
      "“When you talk about football players and do they care? You never doubted that about Ricky Hatton when he went into the ring.",
      "“I met him a number of times in my life, grounded, earthy, a family man, someone you’d say, ‘What a good lad.’ I remember two or three years ago it was our Christmas party, and Ricky turned up, he wasn’t invited.",

      "Neville added: “I’m a United fan, I wanted United to win, but the only potential sort of smile you could give that result is that Ricky would have enjoyed today. 46 years of age is no age and it will take quite a bit of time for the city to get over that news because he was a very, very popular man.",
      "“He was someone that United fans loved, someone that City fans loved, all Mancunians loved and he did an awful lot for the city. He was a champion, a champion in the ring and a champion out of the ring.”",

      "At the end of derby day, Manchester was blue. And you could probably use the same word to describe Ruben Amorim as the Manchester United head coach reflects on another sobering afternoon in the Premier League.",
      "United were comprehensively beaten 3-0 by Manchester City at The Etihad courtesy of goals from Phil Foden and Erling Haaland, who scored twice to clinch the derby day bragging rights. It's a result which means United have made their worst start to a season in 33 years after collecting just four points from their opening four Premier League games.",
      "I find it amazing just how easy a ride Ruben Amorim has had at Manchester United. From fans, pundits, the press - everybody.",
      "Any of his predecessors would have been quite rightly out on their backsides by now. Jose Mourinho, Louis van Gaal, Erik ten Hag and Ole Gunnar Solskjaer were all moved on for less.",
      "Yes - he walked into a mess. A mess that shows no signs of abating behind the scenes. But even so, the tools at his disposal are better than a 15th-placed finish and better than we have seen so far this term. But for a last-gasp win over Burnley, United would be sat on two points and marooned in the bottom three, and frankly their performances show that's where they deserve to be.",
      "They will have to stick with a manager at some point, and I can see why they want it to be this one. But he should be put out of his misery and make way for the next man to take on what is quickly becoming the most poisoned chalice in English football.",
      "I've advocated for Manchester United sticking with Ruben Amorim previously and it's clear the issues at Old Trafford go beyond their head coach. But we're surely now fast approaching the point of no return with Amorim, if we're not already there.",
      "His record of eight wins from 31 Premier League games is absolutely ghastly. Yes, he was dealt a tough hand. But he's shown little to suggest that he is, in fact, the right man to take Manchester United back to where they belong and is absolutely killing himself with his refusal to deviate from his preferred system.",
      "United will probably back him for now and part of me thinks that stance is admirable. And fans deserve credit for sticking with him. But the fact of the matter is Amorim and United are simply not working and the latter needs to make a change sooner rather than later.",
      "United are backing Amorim and they have to after the disaster around Erik ten Hag. After backing him in the summer, it would be rash to act now, but something has to change from within.",
      "Amorim did well, I thought, to play down talk that the system is the problem. When it works, it is difficult to break down and provides a threat good enough to beat teams. The problem he has is he is selecting individuals who either don’t fit the roles being asked of them or just aren’t up to scratch. The obvious one of using Bruno Fernandes deeper and keeping Kobbie Mainoo out.",
      "Amorim has to find a solution before he’s sacked. One of them could be a change in personnel. Putting Mainoo in midfield and pushing Fernandes into one of the No.10s with Bryan Mbeumo or Matheus Cunha playing through the middle would provide more security that could be key in the turnaround.",
      "If he continues to play Fernandes out of position and leave his defence exposed by the lack of midfield, he could be made to pay for it. After Chelsea, they have Brentford and Sunderland, two games they should be earning wins in.",
      "I think United should sack Ruben Amorim now and give a potential new manager the best chance of saving their season. The Reds have been dire so far and I don't think it's going to get better anytime soon.",
      "Yes, United have signed and offloaded players to suit Amorim and his 3-4-2-1 system, but do I believe that someone else can get more from that group of players? I definitely think so.",
      "For example, Kobbie Mainoo SHOULD be in that starting XI, it's as simple as that. A midfield three of him, Bruno Fernandes and Casemiro or Manuel Ugarte need to be the base for the Reds going forward, if they want to be successful from now until the end of the campaign. Unfortunately, Amorim will not do that.",
      "I would bring back Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and look to get the feel-good factor back to Old Trafford for the rest of the season and next summer look to bring Oliver Glasner to Manchester.",
      "Since moving to United from Sporting last season, I think it’s fair to say that Amorim has not had the impact that the club would have hoped. Last season, he had the excuse that the squad wasn’t his own, and he was working with a group of players low on confidence after a poor start to the season.",
      "But he has been backed by United in the summer window. A total spend of around £200 million has seen the arrivals of the likes of Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko. It’s because of that, I feel that Amorim should be given more time. Sacking a manager just a matter of weeks after spending that money in the transfer window feels like taking another major step back.",
      "It does feel like Amorim needs to be a bit less stubborn to change United’s fortunes, but if he can successfully bed in the new signings, it could help him to turn the season around. However, If things don’t change around Christmas, then that’s when the club may have to take another look before the January window.",
      "Square peg, meet round hole. That's what Ruben Amorim's Manchester United have looked like for much of the past 10 months.",
      "The Portuguese has comfortably been United's worst permanent manager of the post-Sir Alex Ferguson era. But he's probably been dealt the toughest hand.",
      "I'm torn over whether I think he'll be a success. On one hand, I admire his disciplined approach when it comes to the likes of Marcus Rashford and Alejandro Garnacho, which suggests to me there's more to the Kobbie Mainoo problem. You can't be leaving a player of his quality out of a dysfunctional midfield without good reason.",
      "But his system isn't working. It's the kind that can function when you have the league's best players (like at Sporting Lisbon) but not with such stern competition as the Premier League. Right now, I'd stick with him, hoping he can change and stop United from throwing away another season.",
      "In season nine of The Simpsons, Krusty the Clown’s announcement that he is quitting showbusiness is met with a question of ‘Why now? Why not 20 years ago?’.",
      "Just say, for one second, that Manchester United decide to cut ties with Ruben Amorim after losing 3-0 to Manchester City. What’s special about this reverse to give it final straw status?",
      "You’d like to think United knew what the deal was when they chose to appoint Amorim in November last year. The hire was meant to be a move away from an overnight fix and towards more of a project, similar to Arsenal’s move from Unai Emery to Mikel Arteta. This isn’t a Jose Mourinho or an Antonio Conte, someone who teams turn to when they aggressively target instant results at the expense of longer-term stability. Equally, though, that doesn’t mean Amorim should be considered safe no matter what.",
      "Even during the low moments in the league, there was progress in Europe last term. Now, after that early Carabao Cup exit, there’s nowhere to hide. Losing to an expensively-assembled City side, still just 16 months out from a title win, isn’t the result which should spell the end for Amorim. There was an argument for it last season, even if it’s one you might not agree with, while there may well be further arguments in the coming weeks. But why now?",
      "Ruben Amorim currently retains the support of the Manchester United hierarchy despite the club's worst start to a season in 33 years. However, one thing is for certain: what is happening on the pitch can not go on.United are a mess. And it looks like it is going to be another tough season for them already; any hope of getting back into Europe, let alone the Champions League, already appears gone. The 3-0 defeat at Manchester City on Sunday leaves Amorim with a horrendous record of eight wins from 31 Premier League games. That is not good enough for any club in the top-flight, let alone United.For me, I feel like Amorim has the next three games to save his job. If United can’t pick up at least seven points against Chelsea, Brentford and Sunderland, then Amorim could be sacked at the start of the October international break.There is no ideal time to sack your manager during the season, but if you are going to do it, then doing it at the start of an international break is probably the best time.",
      "Manchester United have proven in the past that sacking managers left, right and centre doesn't get them anywhere. While the outlook now is gloomy, there is a cycle that the club seems to follow when things aren't going well. If they sack Ruben Amorim now, then all the current players are signings of his or disgruntled stars who have fallen out of favour with the Portuguese boss.",
      "It will take until the next transfer window in January for a new manager to get any sort of rhythm out of a team that is not is, and implement yet another style that the players aren't used to. Then, this new boss will bring in some of his own transfers and boot out others who have yet to showcase their full potential under any management.",
      "This cycle will repeat until the club realises that it is taking one step forward and three steps back. Therefore, it is in the club's best interests in the long run to stick with Amorim for longer than a year to give him half a chance of getting the team into a consistent form.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Kobbie Mainoo made a swift impact for Manchester United in their defeat against rivals Manchester City. The midfielder earned plaudits from fans with a tenacious tackle just moments after coming on.",
      "The Red Devils faced a challenging journey to the Etihad on Sunday and found themselves trailing 1-0 within 18 minutes, courtesy of a Phil Foden header following a dazzling run by Jeremy Doku. The score remained unchanged until half-time, but just eight minutes into the second half, Erling Haaland confidently doubled City's lead.",
      "In response, Ruben Amorim called upon his bench, introducing young midfielder Mainoo, whose loan request over the summer was turned down by the Portuguese manager. Despite expressing his wish to leave Old Trafford, the 20-year-old demonstrated an immediate grit upon entering the pitch that impressed supporters.",
      "Mainoo joined the action 62 minutes into the game, and within seconds, United had won a corner. However, they lost possession from the set-piece, and City began to launch a lethal counter-attack.",
      "Despite only starting one match this season, United's Carabao Cup loss on penalties to Grimsby Town, and making a brief appearance during the 3-2 victory over Burnley in the Premier League, fans are clamouring for more of young talent Mainoo.",
      "One supporter was quick to praise his performance against City, stating: \"Mainoo on the pitch for 20 seconds and already made a successful tackle!\" Another fan echoed these sentiments, adding: \"Immediately Mainoo wins the ball before City can transition!\"",
      "A third fan criticised head coach Amorim, writing: \"Mainoo has been on for six seconds and already making an impact. At this point, this manager is the worst.\"",
      "Meanwhile, another supporter chimed in: \"Mainoo is in and already intercepting passes. Proper centre-mid.\" A fifth continued: \"Kobbie 'can't defend' Mainoo with a tackle to prevent a counter already. But he 'can't run' like [Manuel] Ugarte.\"",
      "However, United's manager remained resolute after the defeat, insisting that he would not alter his footballing philosophy despite a disappointing start to the season.",
      "\"The performance was not good,\" began Amorim. \"I'm trying to be rational. I see the record. I understand the frustration and I understand the decisions that come with that. I take the critics. That's it.",
      "\"There are a lot of things that you have no idea what happened during these months, but I accept that. When I want to change my philosophy, I will change. If not, you have to change the man.",
      "\"And we talk about that every game that we lose. I don't believe in that in the system or whatever. So I play my way and I'm going to play my way until I want to change it.",
      "\"I understand how football is and the results dictate the narrative. I see it that way. I know that is hard for people. The fans do not want to hear these things. I don't lie to myself. I see the record and I accept any decision.\"",

      "During Manchester United's summer tour of the US, Ruben Amorim admitted he had used up any credit he had in the bank last season.",
      "Despite leading United to 15th place, their worst Premier League finish, and losing the Europa League final to miss out on Europe, Amorim retained the backing of the United hierarchy and the club's fans.",
      "Against that backdrop, Amorim knew he could not afford a poor start to this season. But four points from four games and a chastening 3-0 defeat at Manchester City in Sunday's derby has added credence to the growing belief that Amorim's time at United may soon be up.",
      "Amorim, who refuses to change his controversial 3-4-3 system, despite the failure of his players to adapt to it, has won just eight of his 31 Premier League games since taking over from Erik ten Hag 10 months ago.",
      "On that evidence alone, his appointment has been an unmitigated disaster, with the continued backing from those in charge at United now looking like it is founded in hope, rather than any firm expectation that the Portuguese head coach will, in time, turn the situation around.",
      "We have been here before, of course, with United's current football leadership team publicly backing a manager, only to renege on that stance and sack him weeks later. A year ago, chief executive Omar Berrada gave Ten Hag his unequivocal backing in the Old Trafford boardroom, hours before United hosted arch rivals Liverpool in the league.",
      "United were humiliated 3-0 by Arne Slot's side that day and Ten Hag was gone less than eight weeks later, proving Berrada's verbal backing was worthless while the team continued to regress, just as they are doing under Amorim.",
      "The Portuguese head coach insists United are getting better, but there was no evidence of that in their meek capitulation at City on Sunday. Up next for Amorim and his players are world champions Chelsea, who will travel to the Theatre of Dreams on Saturday smelling blood.",
      "How much longer the United hierarchy are willing to stick with Amorim, when the team's performances and results show no sign of progress, only they know. Berrada's problem is that he drove the appointment of Amorim to such an extent that to have to sack him would represent a humiliating personal failing and raise legitimate questions about his judgment going forward.",
      "But with every lame, error-strewn performance and lamentable result, the prospect of Amorim emerging from this current crisis, to lead United back to the top, seems increasingly fanciful, with match-going fans who once backed him irrevocably now starting to have serious doubts.",
      "After Chelsea, United travel to Brentford and then host Sunderland, before the next international break, their first game back after that a trip to Liverpool, to face the champions, who have taken maximum points this season and already look on course to win a 21 st title to usurp their fiercest rivals as England's most successful club.",
      "Whether Amorim is in the Anfield dugout on October 19 depends on how United fare in their next three games before the international break, traditionally a time for struggling clubs to take stock and change their manager if they feel a new voice is needed in the dressing-room and on the training pitch.",
      "Amorim, who twice offered to quit last season, knows he is in trouble and that only an immediate upturn in performances and results will spare him from the same fate suffered by his United predecessors, none of whom could survive managing in the shadow of Sir Alex Ferguson in what continues to be the impossible job.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "On Sunday, Amorim's United underwhelmed in a 3-0 defeat away to Manchester City. Questions continue to be asked about the former Sporting CP boss, and his comments from the week he took charge have now come back into focus.",
      "“In two years you will understand if I am the right man to be in this process,\" Amorim said in November 2024. “In two years you can understand if you want to continue on this path or you want to change.",
      "He urged patience at the time, adding: \"I know at Manchester United we have to win games. We need a lot of time because it's a tough league, we have to improve a lot to try to win the title.",
      "\"We have to change the physical aspect of the team. I don’t know how long it will take,\" he said, and at the time was some weeks out from his first transfer window at the helm.",
      "There were some positives in Amorim's first season, not least the run to the final of the Europa League. United fell short in Bilbao, though, meaning they have to do without European football this term.",
      "He has been backed in the transfer market, adding £200million worth of attacking talent in the form of Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko. However, after defeat at the Etihad Stadium left his side with four points from four games, he insisted he won't move away from his principles and recognised the final say on United's managerial situation isn't down to him and told the higher-ups that - if they want to change the style of play - they'll also need to appoint a new manager.",
      "\"When I want to change my philosophy, I will change. If not, you have to change the man,\" Amorim said. \"We will talk about that every game that we lose. I don't believe in that, in the system, or whatever. I believe in my way and I am going to play my way until I want to change.",
      "\"My message is that I am going to give everything. I will do everything, always thinking about what is best for the club. That was always the same message. It is not my decision, the rest (on whether United change manager). Until I am here, I will do my best. I really want to win games. I am suffering more than them.\"",

      "Another was in the lower tier and remained until the end. \"Personally, I think he's finished,\" he admitted. \"Loads of reds want him to do well but there's nothing at all to say he's the man.\"",
      "\"He's getting hammered in the pub,\" another said. He was not referring to Ruben Amorim drowning his sorrows.",
      "\"Amorim is like a pigeon,\" another messaged, \"endlessly crashing into a glass window, dazed and stubborn, convinced he’ll break through if he just keeps at it.\"",
      "This is not the United matchgoers outright turning against Amorim. They are just resigned to another in-season managerial change.",
      "Amorim fronts up in defeat by strolling onto the pitch to applaud the supporters. There were only a handful remaining in the three tiers of the Etihad's South Stand at full-time on Sunday.",
      "City scoring at least three times, Phil Foden and Erling Haaland on the scoresheet, an emptying away end and an empty feeling. We have become accustomed to this watching United in derbies over the past 12 years. Amorim copped similar treatment to David Moyes, Jose Mourinho, Ralf Rangnick and Erik ten Hag.",
      "And even if Amorim survives long enough to brave the red flares outside Anfield next month, Liverpool have form for immediately, or eventually, seeing off a United manager.",
      "Moyes was sacked 37 days after a 3-0 defeat. Van Gaal was sacked 74 days after a 2-0 defeat. Mourinho was sacked two days after a 3-1 defeat. Ole Gunnar Solskjaer was sacked 28 days after a 5-0 drubbing. Ten Hag was sacked 57 days after a 3-0 defeat.",
      "One sensed at Grimsby that Amorim had gone past the point of no return. That it was in the League Cup and on penalties barely tempered the nuclear fallout from that humiliation. Some players who started that night are unlikely to ever play for United again.",
      "The summer recruitment already appears dubious. United have the ingredients for an appetising filling but their sandwich crumbles with a flaky base and top.",
      "It is on Amorim that he promoted Altay Bayindir to first choice. In 15 appearances for United, Bayindir has conceded 26 goals.",
      "Senne Lammens is inexperienced, such an unknown quantity he was at United's original feeder club, and was not one of the four goalkeepers in the Belgium squad this month. He is due a chance sooner rather than later for the sake of variety.",
      "Benjamin Sesko had his most accomplished outing for United at City yet fired blanks again. It is seven goalless games for club and country this season. Rasmus Hojlund, typically, has found the back of the net for club and country since he fled the United maelstrom.",
      "Luke Shaw's stint as an auxiliary centre back may be over. Amorim, like Ten Hag, favours a left-footer on the left of central defence. The more sensible strategy would be to pick an actual centre back.",
      "Entrusting Shaw in the Europa League final backfired and it was a matter of time until it did so again this season. Harry Maguire is a specialist centre half and a better defender than Shaw but has been reduced to an impact substitute capable of increasing United's lowly goal threat.",
      "United's script on their weakened midfield has already come back to haunt them. Club sources claimed the area was never their priority in the transfer window given the \"strong and versatile options available\".",
      "Casemiro's only memorable performances this calendar year were restricted to the Europa League and United are not in Europe. Kobbie Mainoo has not started a league game since May, with Manuel Ugarte recalled ahead of him in the derby despite his first-half horror show at Grimsby.",
      "Bruno Fernandes and Mason Mount are not specialists. Mount has got injured in the second league fixture in each of his three seasons with United and then been sidelined for at least three weeks.",
      "Three opponents have scored against United through runs from deep. Fernandes was at the scene of the crime again for Phil Foden's 18th-minute header.",
      "Amorim clutched at straws. \"Guys, I understand how football is,\" he said. \"The results will dictate all the narratives.",
      "\"Against Arsenal, do you think we play well?\"",
      "Yes.",
      "\"Do you think we are the better team?\"",
      "Yes.",
      "\"Do you think that (Martin) Odegaard, (Declan) Rice and (Martin) Zubimendi are three top midfielders?\"",
      "Yes.",
      "\"They play with three. We play with two. One was Casemiro, the other was Bruno. Sometimes it is the dynamic of the team. Sometimes it is an opportunity that you score. I see it that way. I know that it is really hard for people [to understand]. The fans don't want to hear me saying these things. I know that they are not going to listen to nothing and be upset. With that, I cannot do nothing.\"",
      "Amorim reiterated that United would only stop playing in the 3-4-2-1 system he is wedded to if they change manager. If he suddenly switched to a back four, United would not necessarily look much better.",
      "Lammens in goal, Noussair Mazraoui at right back, Leny Yoro and Matthijs de Ligt at centre half and Patrick Dorgu at left back, with Manuel Ugarte and Kobbie Mainoo in midfield, Fernandes as the No.10 with Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha either side and Benjamin Sesko up front does not scream Champions League qualifying contenders.",
      "And as enterprising as United were against Arsenal, they lost without scoring to a team that did not perform and protected a 13th-minute goal gifted to them.",
      "That does not grant the manager a free pass.",

      "United invested £225.32million in four signings in the summer but they have won only one of their opening four league fixtures and scored one goal from open play in six hours.",
      "Sandwiched between their dismal league form was the humiliating League Cup elimination by fourth tier Grimsby Town last month. United's only chance of silverware this season is in the FA Cup.",
      "Amorim, 40, is under contract at United until 2027 and reiterated he will not deviate from the 3-4-2-1 system he is wedded to. The Portuguese stressed that if United want to change their formation they will have to change the manager.",
      "\"Guys, I understand that and I accept,\" Amorim said of his league record. \"It is not a record you should have in Manchester United. There are a lot of things - you have no idea what happened during these months - but I accept that. I am not going to change.",
      "\"When I want to change my philosophy, I will change. If not, you have to change the man. We will talk about that every game that we lose. I don't believe in that, in the system, or whatever. I believe in my way and I am going to play my way until I want to change.",
      "\"My message is that I am going to give everything. I will do everything, always thinking about what is best for the club. That was always the same message.",

      "Matthijs de Ligt believes Manchester United's players \"must prove\" they can be a success with Ruben Amorim.",
      "Amorim was appointed from Sporting Lisbon last year and oversaw the worst season at the club for 51 years. Amorim needed to start the new campaign with positive results, but has got off to a poor start.",
      "United have taken just four points from their four Premier League games, which means they have made their worst start to a season since 1992/1993 with Sir Alex Ferguson in charge.",
      "Manchester City secured a comfortable 3-0 win in the Manchester derby on Sunday afternoon.",
      "Speaking after the game, Amorim said United will have to change their manager if they want to change their style, leading to more speculation about his future at Old Trafford.",
      "De Ligt spoke after the game before leaving the Etihad. “In the first half, I think they were the better team. But they didn't have a lot of chances,\" he said.",
      "\"I felt we had a lot of opportunities to create chances. We just couldn’t make the last ball count. In the second half, they scored the 2-0 pretty quickly. But then we went 3-0 down in a rather clumsy fashion.’’",
      "When asked whether United are on the brink of gaining more confidence, De Ligt responded: “Do you see the difference? Do you feel like we’re on the brink of that?",
      "\"Hopefully in the next game. We're working hard every day, so hopefully we can get there quickly.",
      "\"We played better in the second half, but they were definitely much better. And they have quality players up front. That makes all the difference.\"",
      "United's win against Burnley before the international break eased the pressure on Amorim, but the heat has cranked up again following a humiliating defeat in the Manchester derby.",
      "United will play Chelsea, Brentford and Sunderland in the Premier League before the October international break, which is expected to be a chance to assess Amorim's future.",
      "De Ligt was asked about dealing with external noise and explained: “As we've always done, we just have to work hard. We have to improve as a team and hopefully get better.\"",
      "He also answered a question on whether Amorim would be a success. “We have to prove it, otherwise it's no use,\" he said.",
      "Erik ten Hag faced intense pressure at the start of last season. Ten Hag kept his job after winning the FA Cup and survived the September and October international breaks, only to be sacked on October 28.",
      "Amorim must secure wins before the next international break. \"My message is that I am going to give everything,\" Amorim said at his press conference after the derby defeat.",

      "Manchester United head coach Ruben Amorim defended his decision to play Bruno Fernandes in central midfield for the fourth game running at Manchester City.",
      "United lost 3-0 at the Etihad to leave them with four points from their first four Premier League games, their worst start to a season since 1992-93.",
      "Fernandes has dropped back into midfield this season following the signings of Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo, who had occupied the two playmaker roles before Cunha suffered an injury against Burnley two weeks ago.",
      "Amorim picked Amad alongside Mbeumo behind Benjamin Sesko while Fernandes was partnered by Manuel Ugarte, having started alongside Casemiro in the previous three league outings.",
      "United only have three out-and-out central midfielders in Ugarte, Casemiro and Kobbie Mainoo, with the latter yet to start in the league this term.",
      "\"Guys, I understand how football is,\" Amorim said. \"The results will dictate all the narratives. Against Arsenal, who is playing against Arsenal? Do you think we play well? Do you think we are the better team? Do you think that (Martin) Odegaard, (Declan) Rice and (Martin) Zubimendi are three top midfielders? They play with three. We play with two. One was Casemiro, the other was Bruno.",
      "\"Sometimes it is the dynamic of the team. Sometimes it is an opportunity that you score. I see it that way. I know that it is really hard for people [to understand]. The fans don't want to hear me saying these things. I know that they are not going to listen to nothing and be upset. With that, I cannot do nothing.",
      "\"I am trying to be rational and I don't lie to myself. I see the record. I understand the frustration of everybody and I understand any decision that came with that. But that conversation about the two midfielders, the pair, Kobbie and Manu, I understand all these narratives. But then when I look at certain games, we play with two. It is the same thing.",
      "\"Today when you imagine the game, why not use Amad, Bryan, Sesko and Bruno behind with the ball? To be the first guy receiving the ball and then with a lot of pace in front.",
      "\"I am trying to do different things, trying to imagine the game. And then when you don't win, it doesn't work, you take the critics. But that's it.\"",

      "Erling Haaland scored early in the second half and then added another with just over 20 minutes remaining to take the game away from United.",
      "Here are the talking points and moments you might have missed from the game:",
      "Bayindir's confidence is shattered",
      "Altay Bayindir wanted the ground to swallow him up when he conceded the third goal. Haaland finished with ease to net his second of the game and a desolate Bayindir stared at the turf.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo was spotted on the halfway line trying to get Bayindir's attention. Mbeumo was screaming at his goalkeeper, trying to tell him to keep his head up, and he eventually got the message across.",
      "Ruben Amorim confirmed at his pre-match press conference that Bayindir would start, despite making mistakes against Arsenal and Burnley. That backfired because Bayindir was shaky from the first whistle.",
      "He was a bundle of nerves and went down to the ground far too easily for Haaland's first goal. Mbeumo sensed he was low on confidence after conceding City's third and tried to encourage him.",
      "It feels like only a matter of time before Senne Lammens is the first choice goalkeeper.",
      "City fans do the Poznan",
      "City fans brought out The Poznan after going three goals ahead. The fans in front of the press box turned around in glee to face journalists and the dance spread around the entire lower tier.",
      "United only trailed by a goal at the interval and could have found a way back into the contest, but they capitulated in the space of 15 minutes and a lot of fans in the away section started to leave early.",
      "Amorim has overseen some humiliating defeats and a 3-0 loss to City will be added to the catalogue.",
      "The terrace exchange",
      "Former City director of football Txiki Begiristain was shown on the big screen. He received warm applause from the home support, but United fans responded: \"You cheating b*******, you know what you are.\"",
      "There was another rendition of the chant just minutes into the contest, but City fans fired back after taking the lead through Foden, singing their own version of the Amorim chant.",
      "\"Crying from the Stretford End... He'll turn the Reds around,\" they taunted before reverting to \"Old Trafford is falling down, Amorim is a f****** clown. Glazers staying 10 more years\".",
      "There was a debate on a radio station about whether United and City are still proper rivals, but you only need to listen to matchgoing fans to know that was a stupid suggestion.",
      "United fans who work with City supporters will dread going to work this morning.",
      "United need more leaders",
      "Noussair Mazraoui went down with an injury just outside the City box at the start of the second half and Doku approached him to gesture that he was exaggerating the extent of the issue.",
      "City fans whistled at Mazraoui while he took his time to get back to his feet. Leny Yoro began to make his way over, seemingly looking to protect his colleague from Doku's rant.",
      "Yoro was the only United player to offer protection to Mazraoui. The dressing room needs more characters like Yoro.",
      "The midfield is a problem",
      "The decision to start Ugarte raised eyebrows. The midfielder had been hooked at half-time against Grimsby Town after failing to track back for their first goal and was an unused substitute against Burnley.",
      "Amorim was expected to continue with Casemiro and Bruno Fernandes, but he handed another chance to Ugarte because he felt the 24-year-old's pressing ability and energy would be valuable.",
      "Ugarte vindicated Amorim's decision to start him. He was the best player in a red shirt in the first half, breaking up play and stifling City attacks, and he earned warm applause from his manager when he played a wonderful pass over the top to Mbeumo, who was flagged offside.",
      "However, Fernandes had another off day - he was poor when he missed a penalty against Fulham at Craven Cottage last month - and ultimately let the partnership down.",
      "The midfield is a problem for Amorim, but United didn't believe that area was a priority in the summer.",
      "Beautiful tribute for Hatton",
      "The death of legendary boxer Ricky Hatton was announced on Sunday morning. Hatton was a lifelong City supporter and was expected to attend Sunday's derby.",
      "There was a minute's applause held for Hatton prior to the game and the players wore black armbands. Both sets of fans joined in with the tribute and chanted together: \"There's only one Ricky Hatton.\"",
      "Hatton was a proper Mancunian icon and it was heartwarming to hear City and United fans sing his name together.",

      "\"You can say; 'Well the performance first game against Arsenal was pretty good'. We can all agree with that.",

Then, hours after United lost 3-0 to Manchester City, Rashford started for Barcelona in their 6-0 win over Valencia, assisting the second goal.",

      "The 3-0 defeat at Manchester City on Sunday leaves Amorim with a horrendous record of eight wins from 31 Premier League games. United are bottom of a table consisting of the 17 ever-present top flight teams dating back to his first match in charge on November 24.",
      "A source close to Amorim admits it is \"incredible\" that his position is not under genuine threat despite 16 defeats in the 31 league matches.",
      "Amorim, 40, is under contract at United until 2027 and reiterated he will not deviate from the 3-4-2-1 system he is wedded to. The Portuguese stressed that if United want to change their formation they will have to change the manager.",
      "Gary Pallister believes that Sunday's chastening 3-0 defeat to Manchester City won't have an immediate effect on Ruben Amorim's future.",
      "\"I think Mason was desperate to do well. I think he started [the season] okay. And then we lose them both to injuries. I think there'll be patience. Everybody's going to put him under the pump for sticking with the back three. It's not what a lot of teams do. And the longer it goes, and the longer we struggle with it, the more questions are going to be asked.\"",
      "\"Whether it's in his mindset to think about playing a back four... I'd love to be a fly on the wall in the dressing room to see what the players think about it. Sometimes you can hide behind that. I mean, players are players. At the end of the day, you win your battles. It's you against your centre-forward. It's you against the guy in midfield. You win your personal battles.",
      "\"And if you do that, the team's probably going to get success. You can. Whether you play a back three or a back four. And the goals we conceded were probably down to individual players' mistakes.\"",
      "Ruben Amorim is reportedly being considered by Benfica after as sack pressure ramps up following his Manchester United side's dismal start to the campaign.",
      "United lost 3-0 to Manchester City in the Manchester derby on Sunday and Amorim became the target of criticism from pundits. The Portuguese has now only won won eight of his 31 league games in charge since taking over from Erik ten Hag last November.",
      "Outsiders are keeping an eye on his situation and reports in Portugal claim he is being considered as a potential manager for Benfica. Next month, the Portuguese giants will hold elections for a new president. Candidate Joao Noronha Lopes, together with former Benfica and Portugal international Nuno Gomes, who is running as vice-president, are reportedly considering Amorim as a potential coach.",
      "The pair were in attendance at the Etihad Stadium on Sunday and, upon their return to Lisbon, were quizzed about the latest rumours.",

      "Man United are reportedly interested in Dumfries ahead of the January transfer window.",
      "However, Football Insider claim that City are also keen to secure the services of Inter Milan and Netherlands full-back. The 29-year-old recently revealed that he is open to a move to the Premier League, seemingly leaving the door open for a transfer to either Old Trafford or the Etihad.",
      "With his contract set to expire next summer, Dumfries will be free to hold talks with clubs abroad starting in the New Year.",
      "Man United are reportedly interested in Nottingham Forest midfielder Anderson, claims Football Insider.",
      "However, Reds chief scout Mick Brown views a potential deal as 'difficult.'",
      "\"It’s another difficult deal, but I’m not surprised Man United have been looking at Anderson,\" he said. \"Now that he’s broken into the England squad, his profile is only going to get bigger.",
      "\"He was sold for £35million, and the way he’s going right now, if he continues to impress for club and country in the next 12 months, you’ll see his price double at least. He’s on a long-term contract at the City Ground until 2029, so Forest are under no pressure to sell.",
      "\"He’s on the radar of a lot of clubs, but I don’t think there’s anything imminent on his future. Forest will be more than content to keep him, and the player is happy there and happy to stay with the way things are working out for him at Forest. I don’t expect he’ll be planning to move on any time soon as things stand.\"",

      "The result confirmed United's worst start to a season since 1992/93. However, in his homeland Amorim is widely regarded as one of the game's top managers, having restored Sporting Clube de Portugal's European status and ended their Liga Portugal title drought of almost 20 years before succeeding Erik ten Hag at United.",
      "Now, Sporting's rivals Benfica are reportedly keeping a close eye on his situation in Manchester. Benfica are set to hold elections for a new president next month and one of the candidates, Joao Noronha Lopes, reportedly already has Amorim on his list of potential managers.",
      "Read more here.",
      "Micah Richards has claimed that Ruben Amorim must fix Manchester United's midfield if he wants to keep his job, following Sunday's thumping 3-0 loss at Manchester City.",
      "Speaking on The Rest Is Football, Richards said: \"That’s exactly right, and that's what I've been saying on Sky after the game. From the studio, you have a bird's eye view so you can see all the positions, and in the first minute, Haaland gets his chance. United grew into the game a little bit. A little bit of confidence.",
      "\"I remember saying after the United vs Arsenal game, 'I can see an improvement'. I actually thought, in aspects of the game today, Man United did good things. But what is crystal clear, in the middle of the park, they need more legs. I can see that, all the fans can see that, but the manager is sticking to his guns and I just don't understand it.",
      "\"Every manager should be able to adapt. You got Rodri, who actually in the first half, I didn't think he played too well, he gave the ball away too easily, but you got legs with [Tijani] Reijnders and you got Foden playing off Haaland. You got [Jeremy] Doku coming into little pockets and you got Bernardo Silva.",
      "\"So, when you see them playing with [Benjamin] Sesko and [Bryan] Mbeumo and [Amad] Diallo, they’re forward-thinking players, so they can give you what you need in terms of the start of the shape you’re trying to do.\"",
      "Ruben Amorim must show improvement or he will be sacked by Manchester United before Christmas, according to former Manchester City and Liverpool midfielder Dietmar Hamann.",
      "Speaking to Racing Tipster, Hamman said: \"I think Ruben Amorim has got to turn things around quickly. There was a case to be made last season to change the manager in the summer, but they decided against it. They spent money again, bringing in Matheus Cunha and Benjamin Sesko. At some stage, you want to see improvement.",
      "\"So far, it hasn't happened. If it doesn't happen by Christmas, I'm not too sure whether he'll still be in charge.\"",
      "Wayne Rooney has warned under-fire Manchester United boss Ruben Amorim time is running out for him to turn the team around.",
      "United legend Rooney painted a bleak picture for Amorim in the wake of Sunday's derby debacle and suggested there was little evidence of the Portuguese head coach salvaging the situation.",
      "\"It's hard to see how it continues,\" said Rooney. \"I don’t think anyone can understand and comprehend what's going on. Frankly, it's not good enough.",
      "\"I want to be as supportive and positive as I can be on the manager and the players.",
      "\"But it's very difficult to sit here and say we're seeing progression and at least we're seeing things that will get results in the near future.",
      "\"We're seeing none of that and it's very difficult. There was an image towards the end of the game where I saw the Manchester United fans leaving.",
      "\"I think that's so powerful that the United fans were leaving the game. You know the game is over and I think they were very disappointed in what they were seeing.\"",
      "Former Premier League forward Charlie Austin believes that Zinedine Zidane should be Manchester United's first-choice option to replace Ruben Amorim at Old Trafford.",
      "\"I think he's got to go, if it's my decision, I'm going after Zinedine Zidane,\" Austin said. \"Ultimately, there are a different set of managers that you've got to be looking at, because the situation Manchester United are in, I would take Zidane but is he the right man for the job and how we see them, probably not.",
      "\"In my honest opinion, you have to look at the job Sean Dyche did at Burnley, what he did at Everton. For me, he stabilised the club, at least he's going to put structure in there.",
      "\"Zidane is the top of the tree for me, but what the club needs now is structure because that is something they do not have. I know Manchester United fans will look at me saying, 'he said Sean Dyche', no, they need structure [and] that is a man who will come in and make the team a lot better than what we are all seeing.\"",
      "According to Fichajes via GiveMeSport, Manchester United are hoping to sign Bayern Munich defender Dayot Upamecano on a free transfer next summer.",
      "The Frenchman's contract is set to expire at the end of the season and United are tracking his services ahead of a potential move. Upamecano has made more than 150 appearances for Bayern.",
      "Alan Shearer and Gary Lineker were both in agreement about Benjamin Sesko's performance during Manchester United's bruising 3-0 defeat against Manchester City.",
      "Sesko, 22, who joined United in a £73.7million move from RB Leipzig in the summer, made his first Premier League start at the Etihad Stadium but struggled throughout.",
      "Indeed, the Slovenia international had just 20 touches, one shot, completed 14 passes and won 33 per cent of his duels before he was replaced in the 80th minute.",
      "Speaking on The Rest Is Football podcast, Shearer delivered his verdict on Sesko and expressed his concern about how United used him. \"I look at Sesko, because I've obviously been in that position, and he had that one shot very early on in the game,\" Newcastle legend Shearer said.",
      "\"Other than that, he must be thinking, 'Any danger? Any chance of giving me something here?' Something to go after, some crosses.\"",
      "Ex-Leicester City and Tottenham forward Lineker added: \"He was absolutely starved of any real service. He went through once where he broke the offside trap and the keeper blocked his shot.",
      "\"But he does look quick for a big guy, and I watched him specifically for a lot of the game – as much as you can when you’re watching TV rather than being at the game – and his movement, he's making darting runs, but I felt for him a little bit. It's tough when you're not getting any service.\"",
      "Gary Lineker has claimed that Kobbie Mainoo has been \"dismissed\" at Manchester United and is \"baffled\" about his lack of game time under Ruben Amorim.",
      "Speaking on The Rest Is Football podcast, Lineker said: \"It really worries me the way Kobbie Mainoo has been kind of almost dismissed. He’s such an incredible young talent, local boy as well doing really well.",
      "\"I mean, I thought when he came on, he did really quite well. I don't get it. I don’t know whether there's something that we don't know about or something like that, but it's slightly baffling to me.\"",

      "Speaking in his post-match press conference, Hurzeler acknowledge that the speculation has not been simple for Baleba to handle. \"I think it's normal for a young player when the media creates the noise around him,\" he said. \"It's not easy for this player to handle it.\"",
      "\"Therefore, we need to give him the time and support so he comes back to his best performance,\" Hurzeler continued. \"But he's a young player and I think that's something we have to accept, that young players don't always have the face we want to see.\"",

      "With four points from their opening four matches, United have endured their worst start to a Premier League season since 1992/93. They also suffered a humiliating Carabao Cup second round exit to League Two side Grimsby Town, with the Reds losing 12-11 on penalties following a 2-2 draw after normal time.",
      "It comes after United recorded their joint-worst Premier League finish (15th) with their lowest-ever points tally (42) and most defeats (15) since the competition began 33 years ago.",
      "During his time at United - after replacing Erik ten Hag as United's new head coach in November 2023 - Amorim's record is miserable. Indeed, Amorim has won just eight of his 31 top-flight matches in charge.",
      "While his overall record is inflated due to United's Europa League record last season, he still has just a 36 per cent win rate from his 47 games at the helm, drawing 12 and losing 18 of them.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "Hamann, meanwhile, believes that United's stance on Amorim will change if results do not improve in the near future. In fact, Hamann has claimed that the former Sporting CP manager may be out by Christmas if he fails to turn United's fortunes around.",
      "Speaking to Racing Tipster, Hamman said: \"I think Ruben Amorim has got to turn things around quickly. There was a case to be made last season to change the manager in the summer, but they decided against it. They spent money again, bringing in Matheus Cunha and Benjamin Sesko.

The approach that we had in that play, we can avoid, and we can close our goal.",

      "Rasmus Hojlund expressed his delight at joining Napoli after scoring his first goal since leaving Manchester United.",
      "Hojlund left United on transfer deadline day to join Napoli on a loan deal until the end of the season, which also includes an obligation to make the move permanent next summer. Certain conditions will need to be activated for the Serie A champions to be obligated to pay the €44million (£38million) transfer fee to United next summer.",
      "United have already received €6million (£5.2m) from Napoli for the loan fee for Hojlund's transfer. The striker found the back of the net on Saturday night as the Italian outfit claimed a 3-1 win away at Fiorentina.",
      "Former Manchester City star Kevin De Bruyne was also on the score sheet for Napoli from the penalty spot.",
      "After scoring an important goal for Napoli, Hojlund explained why he was delighted to get on the score sheet for his new club after leaving Old Trafford.",
      "\"Today we won an important match, and I'm really glad I scored and to be part of this incredible team.\"",
      "Hojlund's next task will be trying to score in the Champions League for Napoli, with a league phase fixture against City next on the agenda on Thursday night.",
      "\"I think we just need to focus on the next match and keep sharp,\" said Hojlund.",
      "\"Everybody is going to play a lot of minutes, because we're in a lot of tournaments with a lot of games.\"",

      "Pep Guardiola's City took the lead in the 18th minute at the Etihad Stadium as Phil Foden scored his first Premier League goal since January, heading Jeremy Doku's cross into the far corner.",
      "However, it looked far too easy from United's perspective. Shaw allowed Doku to dribble past him with ease before getting to the by-line and delivering at the second attempt for Foden to head home. Fernandes, meanwhile, let Foden run from behind him and get into the space to score.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "\"But United's defending, the two midfielders beforehand are too square and Shaw just gives up. It's a nice bit of skill, but Shaw's an England international player.",
      "\"He's got hundreds of games under his belt, he doesn't even get his body position right. It's like he has thrown the towel in. We know people can run off the back of Bruno, that's been going on for years.",
      "\"But my goodness, even before that, you've got two midfielders - they are too square. One pass takes them out. Far too easy. Shaw just throws the towel in there.\"",
      "Micah Richards blamed Fernandes for the goal and believes he should have tracked Foden. \"I just want to look at Fernandes' position here, though,\" Richards admitted.",
      "\"He's playing in that two in midfield and once the ball is over at that side, now you have got to read the danger and he just loses Foden there. Just switches off and it wasn't good enough.\"",
      "City continued to probe as the half wore on but United were a threat on the counter-attack. Benjamin Sesko got in behind on a couple of occasions and forced Gianluigi Donnarumma into two smart saves.",
      "Despite this, City led 1-0 going into the break - a scoreline that Pep Guardiola would have been pleased with.",

      "The stand will open first, with the rest of the project set to be completed later in 2026. The new facilities will then sit alongside Co-op Live to complete a significant overhaul to that part of east Manchester.",

      "Manchester United hinted on Sunday morning at who could replace the injured Diogo Dalot in their starting line-up to face Manchester City.",
      "Dalot pulled out of the Portugal squad last week after reportedly suffering muscle discomfort while training with them. United head coach Ruben Amorim has acknowledged that the defender will not be available to play in the Manchester derby.",
      "He is one of eight players to appear in all four of the club's matches thus far this season. That group will be reduced significantly this weekend as Mason Mount and Matheus Cunha are unavailable after being injured against Burnley.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "Amad, Benjamin Sesko, Bruno Fernandes, Bryan Mbeumo and Matthijs de Ligt complete the current crop of ever-presents. Dalot being absent likely assures the former of a start at right-wing-back.",
      "The Portugal international started there instead of Amad against Arsenal on the opening weekend of this season. Since then, though, they have predominantly played together, occupying opposite wings with Dalot switching flanks.",
      "Both played the full 90 minutes versus Burnley at Old Trafford last time, with Patrick Dorgu being an unused substitute for the first time this term. However, much like away at Fulham last month, the Denmark international will seemingly come in on the left.",
      "United hinted at his involvement across their social media channels on Sunday morning. Their first post of matchday is a 14-second video featuring several clips of players, the second of whom to feature after Fernandes is Dorgu.",
      "Amorim's first signing earlier this year also started and played the full 90 minutes in his Manchester derby debut during early April. Amad was unavailable through injury on that occasion, with Dalot on the right.",
      "That match ended 0-0 at Old Trafford. As well as contributing to the team keeping a clean sheet, Dorgu almost assisted the only goal after crossing for substitute Joshua Zirkzee, only for Ederson to save.",

      "The Blues trailed 1-0 at the interval following a superb strike from Kevin Schade but appeared destined to return to Stamford Bridge with maximum points and local pride intact after strikes from Cole Palmer and Moises Caicedo, with the latter firing home a thunderbolt from the edge of the area in the 85th minute.",
      "However, the unmarked Carvalho emerged in the dying moments to poke home a leveller and deflate the Blues' hopes following a lengthy throw-in.",
      "\"What happens as it develops is this is the key battle. Garnacho has a job to do, he's got to mark Carvalho,\" Redknapp explained, identifying the winger and Carvalho on screen.",
      "\"That's your job. Simple as that. Don't lose him, you're now one of the defensive players in here. If he gets in behind you, it's on you.",
      "\"Everybody else is trying to win that first contact; it's not easy, Brentford have got some big guys. But Garnacho just falls asleep at the vital moment. Ball comes in, Garnacho's not concentrating, they get that contact and there [Carvalho] is at the back post.\"",
      "Garnacho switched to Chelsea from Manchester United in a £40million transfer and had previously celebrated his debut appearance in a Blues jersey by setting up Caicedo for his stunning late strike.",
      "When Enzo Maresca was questioned about whether he believed his team had done sufficient to secure victory, he responded to journalists: \"I think so, yeah. I think in the second half, we scored twice.",
      "\"We could have scored two or three more goals. Cole had a chance, Pedro [Neto] had a chance. So I think we did enough. Unfortunately, we lost two points just in the last two or three minutes.\"",

As much as the head coach has tried to clutch at the thinnest of straws to find positives from his 3-4-3 system, the brutal truth is that it’s not working and likely never will.",

      "“So as much as the manager’s going ‘this is where we’re going lads’, and at the start you’re probably going ‘new manager, new ideas, something different’…but as the results don’t come and you keep getting beaten and you’re struggling against the better teams … it’s like they’re going around in circles.",
      "“If some of the players are now starting to doubt that – and I’m not saying they are, but you see the goals they’ve given away – and you’re going ‘are some of the players fully on board with this manager?’.”",
      "And a new report from journalist Fraser Fletcher for our pals at TEAMtalk has confirmed Keane’s “worry” by revealing ‘player frustrations’ at Man Utd.",
      "‘The dressing room, while fond of Amorim’s charisma — he famously shattered a monitor after a 2-0 loss to Brighton & Hove Albion — shows signs of unrest.",
      "‘Players question his refusal to pivot mid-match, with his tactics struggling against the Premier League’s relentless pace. “They back his passion, but the lack of in-game adjustments is frustrating,” a source disclosed.’",
      "As soon as internal leaks from Man Utd start to surface, it is a sign that their current head coach is on the exit ramp and we appear to have reached this stage of Amorim’s tenure at Old Trafford.",
      "Amorim may copy Vincent Kompany in sticking to his guns en route to landing a big job elsewhere, but he is going about it the wrong way if he wants to succeed at Man Utd, as his refusal to adapt will be looked back upon as the starting point of his road to be their latest post-Sir Alex Ferguson manager to be sacked.",
      "Scholes claims Man Utd committed a “criminal offence” in the transfer window this summer and highlighted the “big issue” which remains unresolved under Amorim.",
      "Sound the ‘losing the Manchester United dressing’ room klaxon; ‘the beginning of the end’ is nigh for Ruben Amorim.",

      "Man Utd have identified Unai Emery as the best candidate to replace Ruben Amorim as pressure builds on the Red Devils boss, according to reports.",
      "Are Man United actually going to be any better this season than last season? They really might not be much better. In which case, Amorim’s in trouble.",
      "Arsenal have exposed problems at Chelsea, Liverpool look great and Nick Woltemade is fun. But Ruben Amorim needs to be sacked if he is doing ‘everything’."

      "Arsenal have been leapfrogged in the Premier League prize money table by Liverpool and a rather less likely contender for the finance crown.",
      "Premier League clubs received a total of £2.83billion last season, which was comprised of six payments through the division’s ‘central revenue system’, something the Premier League says ‘ensures the most equitable distribution of funds of any major European league’.",
      "Liverpool were paid £174.9m as champions – short of Manchester City’s record £176.2m in 2022/23 – while Newcastle received just over £160m to chuck into their PSR black hole.",
      "Southampton were handed £109.2m for their efforts in finishing a distant bottom. It pays to be in the Premier League.",
      "Some of those payments are fixed. All 20 clubs automatically receive around £96.9m through an equal share distributed based on both the domestic (£29.8m in 2024/25) and international (£59.2m in 2024/25) broadcast deals – those TV rights are lucrative for a reason – as well as £7.9m each from central commercial revenue streams.",
      "The rest is variable, based on where clubs finish and how often their games are selected for broadcast.",
      "",
      "The Premier League merit payments are distributed on a sliding scale from 1st to 20th, made up of combined earnings from domestic and international broadcast deals.",
      "For the 2024/25 season, the difference in prize money was around £2.7m per position. Southampton were given as much for finishing bottom, all the way up to champions Liverpool receiving £53.1m. It basically helped pay for 97.4% of Giorgi Mamardashvili and Jeremie Frimpong.",
      "That can be expected to fluctuate with inflation and other factors – it was around £2.8m per position in 2023/24 – but it offers a rough guide as to what clubs should expect to earn this season.",
      "",
      "1st (Liverpool) – £53.1m",

      "20th (Wolves) – £2.7m",
      "",
      "The only other part of the prize money which is not fixed and shared equally are the facility fees, which are based on how many times each club has been selected for television.",
      "In 2024/25, Liverpool had 30 games televised in the UK, for which they received £24.9m in facility fees. Arsenal had 29 matches and were paid £24.2m, while Manchester United (28 games for £23.4m), Aston Villa (27 games for £22.6m) and Chelsea (26 games for £21.8m) were televised frequently and rewarded handsomely.",
      "Ipswich were shown on the fewest occasions and received £8.9m in facility fees for their 10 live televised UK fixtures.",
      "This can lead to discrepancies in terms of those variable payments. Manchester United’s prize money after finishing 15th last season was £136.2m, more than the four clubs immediately above them – West Ham (£130.9m in 14th), Everton (£131.8m in 13th), Crystal Palace (£136.1m in 12th) and Fulham (£135.5m in 11th) – as Ruben Amorim’s side were picked for far more live TV games.",
      "Spurs were another massive outlier, earning more in 17th (£127.8m) than Wolves did in 16th (£123.1m) in part because they had nine more games picked for live UK broadcast.",

      "Ruben Amorim is experiencing deja vu with one Manchester United summer signing, while his predecessor shines away from the ‘graveyard’…",
      "“[Manchester United has] become a graveyard for coaches and players – it’s not too strong a term.”",
      "These were the words of Man Utd legend Gary Neville around two years and it remains true to this day as successful signings are still few and far between under Sir Jim Ratcliffe, who is yet to oversee a positive overhaul of the culture at Old Trafford.",
      "This has been proven over the past year, as Marcus Rashford and Antony enjoyed dramatic returns to form almost instantly following their loans to Aston Villa and Real Betis from Man Utd in January.",
      "Napoli cult hero Scott McTominay is another example of a player who has taken his game to a new level after leaving Man Utd, and Rasmus Hojlund could be the next.",
      "Hojlund, who joined Man Utd from Atalanta in 2023 in a deal worth up to £72m, suffered a huge fall from grace after his 16-goal debut campaign at Old Trafford as he was widely slated for most of last season.",
      "Amorim followed Hojlund’s many critics in writing off the 22-year-old, insisting on his exit as he omitted him from squads en route to his loan-to-buy move to Napoli.",
      "READ: Premier League winners and losers: Amorim sack; Emery, Maresca struggle; Arsenal, Woltemade shine",
      "Hojlund’s exit became a formality as soon as Man Utd beat Newcastle United, as they did with Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha, to sign Benjamin Sesko for around £74m from RB Leipzig.",
      "Sesko is very much a like-for-like replacement for Hojlund, as he is also a 22-year-old with great physical attributes and potential to grow into a well-rounded No.9.",
      "However, the trajectories of each striker have gone in opposing directions at the start of this season; Sesko has been ineffective and is goalless in five appearances, while Hojlund immediately got off the mark with a goal in his Serie A debut for Napoli.",
      "This is typical of the mess Man Utd have created in many a year post-Sir Alex Ferguson, though it was always bound to happen.",
      "Last season, Hojlund’s general play was really poor and he was rightly criticised, but it was no wonder he was so short of confidence, given the severe lack of service from the supporting cast.",
      "Hojlund was feeding off scraps for most of the 2024/25 campaign and his game had not developed enough to ensure he could score from his one or two chances per game.",
      "Now, Hojlund is one game into his career at a new club and already looks a far stronger prospect through operating in Antonio Conte’s well-drilled 4-1-4-1 formation rather than Amorim’s flawed 3-4-3 system.",
      "At Man Utd, a supposed summer of change is yet to make much of a difference as most of last season’s issues remain, including their toothless attack.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo has been a bright spark in the No.10 position, but Man Utd’s overall attacking unit are still failing to get their No.9 into the game as Sesko has been on the periphery in his minutes so far.",
      "It is already being reported that Man Utd ‘regret’ signing Sesko, but it is too soon to throw out such suggestions as he is only partly to blame for his early struggles as Amorim’s naive insistence on playing his formation is undermining the striker’s integration.",
      "Until there is a change, either via a sacking or Amorim altering his methods, Sesko faces following in Hojlund’s footsteps as an underutilised striker being held back in the “graveyard for coaches and players”.",
      "Man Utd were given more indications over the weekend that they could be the problem as Marcus Rashford and Andre Onana shone out on loan.",
      "Man Utd legend Peter Schmeichel reckons the Red Devils could have saved £73m by keeping Rasmus Hojlund and not signing Benjamin Sesko.",
      "Liverpool ‘flop’ Florian Wirtz didn’t look like a £116m player before the international break, so he features among a struggling Big Six sextet needing to step up…",
      "Man Utd are regretting their decision to not sign Fiorentina forward Moise Kean instead of Benjamin Sesko over the summer, according to reports.",

The team was losing confidence, the results were denied and the owners decided to change,” Manuel Pellegrini once said, blaming his eventual sacking on the substandard performances of a player he specifically pushed for in Roberto.",
      "If Potter cannot turn this around – and the evidence he can has become infinitesimal – then the signing of Hermansen will take its rightful place alongside a midfield of Tomas Soucek and James Ward-Prowse as the chief reasons atop his P45.",

      "Nuno Espirito Santo has ‘won’ the Sack Race after the complete breakdown of key relationships at Nottingham Forest produced the inevitable international-break outcome.",
      "That has removed one of the few managers who had been providing some cover for Man United boss Ruben Amorim, who only really has misery and Graham Potter for company.",
      "And here are possible replacement managers currently between jobs. Pretty much every one of them would have avoided defeat to Grimsby Town, we reckon.",
      "",
      "There is a small yet increasingly confident part of our brain that remains stubbornly convinced Liverpool are going to completely f*ck it this season. The only real tangible thing to build this doom-laden scenario upon is a lack of depth at centre-back, but still we keep coming back to the question: what if all those exciting new attacking players turn out to be massive disaster-flops?",
      "Most of our brain thinks they probably won’t f*ck it and might even be better than last season, but even that tiny idiot part convinced of pending disaster doesn’t think it could possibly materialise quickly or dramatically enough for Slot to be in any kind of danger before at least one other poor sod has been given the hook elsewhere.",
      "Even if they were really quite shambolic defensively in the Community Shield and didn’t entirely assuage those doubts against Bournemouth either. But against Arsenal they showed the ‘mettle of champions’.",
      "",
      "Among the least sackable managers in the top flight, and the only club we could really picture trying to lure him away this summer was Spurs and that’s now safely off the table.",
      "It’s been a difficult summer for Bournemouth but Iraola has masses of credit in the bank and the excellent start they’ve made despite everything is only strengthening Iraola’s standing.",
      "",
      "It is still very early days and it’s been two big steps forward and one huge step back from his first three Tottenham games. Frank is obviously a decent coach, but none of us really know how he’ll get on outside the very specific environment he had at Brentford.",
      "Especially as Spurs’ environment is… not like that one. He’s going to have a big job on to sort out an awful lot of mess at history’s funniest ever Champions League qualifiers. He appeared to have already thoroughly De-Anged the lot of them only for them to then turn up against Bournemouth and defend like an Ange team while attacking like a Mourinho one.",
      "You know who else won their first couple of games, including one against Man City, after stepping up to Spurs from a smaller but less daft Premier League club? That’s right. But while the Nuno comparisons are obvious, and a world in which Frank doesn’t make the November international break entirely possible, it doesn’t quite feel like the same situation.",
      "Crucially, there has been no undignified scramble to find a new manager this time. Whatever your thoughts on the timing and manner of Ange Postecoglou’s sacking and the identity of his replacement, it’s also clear Spurs have got the man they wanted in a way they very obviously didn’t when Nuno came in.",
      "That surely buys Frank a bit of time even if things do get hairy. Enough at least for someone else to get canned before he does. Probably.",
      "The fact the squad has not (yet) had anything like the summer renovations it required also cuts both ways here, we fancy. Frank clearly wants a few more bodies in, but their absence means he is less likely to be first in line if and when fans start dishing out blame. That is likely to once again be Gary Neville’s new best mate, especially after the Eze Fiasco and despite the Xavi Redemption.",

      "Defeat at Leeds on the opening weekend was distinctly squibbish, but Everton have bounced back in some style since to suggest they could not just survive but thrive. With Jack Grealish in impish early-season form, they might even be fun.",

      "An earlier version of this oft-updated piece speculated on what might happen to Mikel Arteta should Arsenal suffer from their Nightmare Start. What if they lost a few early games? What then? We concluded this:",
      "It’s far likelier that Arsenal emerge blinking into the autumn sunshine largely unscathed from their nightmare horrors. No denying that this season does represent one in which Arteta might completely lose the plot and go entirely off the rails. Or the one where he wins the league by 10 points. Feels like we’re odds-on to get one or the other.",
      "The first part is already locked in. So now we wait: is it full meltdown or sauntering to the league title? Nothing else will be tolerated or is indeed even possible.",
      "READ: Who will be the next manager of Arsenal if Mikel Arteta is sacked?",
      "",
      "West Ham at home was a kind start for Sunderland and Le Bris, but boy did they cash in. Came back down to earth with a bump at Burnley, but the late turnaround to beat Brentford – and 0-0 draw with a good Palace side – means it’s a hugely encouraging start for the Black Cats and their manager.",
      "",
      "At various points we’ve expended daft amounts of energy attempting to manifest a ‘Howe Sack’ crisis because we’re messy bitches who live for drama. But we’ve never managed to make it stick even a tiny bit and we started the summer thinking there was little imminent prospect of going for it again with Howe the hero of the Geordie Nation for delivering silverware and more lovely, lovely Champions League football.",
      "Now, though, after a traumatic summer and the Alexander Isak Saga and a troubling winless start to the season, our Spidey Sense is tingling once more. We’re going to be right back in the saddle come November after a run of two draws and a defeat leaves the Magpies seven points outside the top six.",
      "",
      "A sacking remains out of the question despite last season’s (relative) struggles. There hasn’t been a Premier League manager since Fergie in his pomp with more credit in the bank than Pep.",
      "But is there still a distinct chance Guardiola decides he’s had enough and simply walks away? We reckon there is, and it’s always worth remembering that we’re talking First Premier League Manager To Leave here, and that the traditional ‘Sack Race’ shorthand is a bit misleading.",
      "Still, though. Almost no chance that could happen swiftly enough for nobody else to have been canned first. Even if consecutive defeats brought back memories of last winter.",
      "",
      "Just a slightly less clear-cut version of Glasner really. Not about to be sacked, but could be in the frame for a poaching. And if that poaching comes from outside the Premier League, then he could technically be the first manager to go.",
      "",
      "One of the key early-season imponderables for 25/26 is just how big and what kind of impact the Club World Cup has on the way Chelsea and Man City start the season. Does the fact they’ve got plenty of (semi-)competitive games in their legs give them an early boost? Or will they just be knackered and given the runaround by fresher legs?",
      "He definitely still has some hearts and minds to win at Chelsea despite the fine finish to the season that saw them tick off Champions League qualification while completing their collection of UEFA pots and pans and then winning the actual Club World Cup.",
      "A home draw with Crystal Palace wasn’t ideal, but the paddling dished out to West Ham has what really should at least be some kind of halfway credible title bid up and running at least. And we strongly suspect Fulham won’t be the last team left scratching their head after losing to Maresca.",
      "There is some talk of ‘Maresca out’ after a draw with Brentford but that’s surely only a minority view at this point.",
      "",
      "Fine end to 24/25 put a different complexion on Brighton’s season than at one time appeared likely. Ending up a clear best of the rest outside the quickly established top seven represented at least a passing grade and they’d have to make a truly awful start to the season to get in any kind of managerial-change bother.",
      "It’s not been awful, but it’s really not been great either. Being above Manchester United is not the boast it used to be.",
      "",
      "Burnley really do have a horrible start under a manager with a horrible record at this level, and have already been given a clear reminder by the team that finished 17th last season of just how much harder the ‘simply don’t concede any goals at all’ tactic is going to be to deliver in the Premier League.",
      "Essentially, Burnley have got back to this level the same way Homer Simpson got to a heavyweight title fight. And Spurs have already given them a pummelling.",
      "Victory over Sunderland was an impressive and necessary reminder that it might still be enough against teams more on their level, but Parker will still need some fairly early evidence it can also work against established Premier League teams, which makes Burnley’s start so problematic and that win over Sunderland both vital yet potentially deceptive.",
      "There were encouraging signs before late heartbreak against eternally stupid Manchester United and against champions-elect Liverpool but now they have Forest, Manchester City and Aston Villa before the first weekend of October is out. And Parker may well be too.",
      "",
      "Missing out on the Champions League in the manner they did was definitely a p*sser, and while Villa were perfectly good last season, it was one that felt a bit flat in the end. It was good, but it could have been great. They could have finished in the top five. They could have won the FA Cup. They could even have knocked out PSG in the Champions League after thar barnstorming Villa Park comeback.",
      "These annoyances are real and meaningful, and this season is off to a troubling start. But it’s still hard to see how they could possibly translate to Emery being in anything like the sort of bother that put him at risk of being out on his ear in the early months of the season. The latter months of the season? Could be a different tale there.",
      "",
      "The continuity candidate, but how much continuity can there be at Brentford given they’ve sold Bryan Mbeumo and Christian Norgaard, while Thomas Frank took most of the remaining coaching staff with him to Tottenham? It’s a very Brentford move to promote from within but will they be forced into the very un-Brentford move of sacking him in October when the Bees are in a relegation battle?",
      "A win over an Aston Villa side in the midst of their own funk certainly buys some time. At the very least it surely pushes any real sack talk firmly beyond the first international break, and this season that really might be enough to make you third or fourth manager out at worst.",
      "",
      "Won’t be sacked, obviously, because Palace are absolutely punching with an elite-level manager who is quietly delivering astonishing results in trying circumstances.",
      "But with reports he was willing and ready to walk out if Marc Guehi was sold without a replacement point to new strains on a relationship that is bound to be tested in the weeks and months ahead.",
      "Nailed it in the Community Shield, but as ever for clubs on Palace’s level there’s a positive-and-negative scale to be balanced by your manager catching the eye so conspicuously. Glasner absolutely could be poached with bigger beasts surely paying attention to the work he’s done at Selhurst Park.",
      "And if that poaching comes from outside the Premier League, then it comes with the possibility of making Glasner the next Premier League managerial casualty. But still very unlikely.",
      "The nerves at Selhurst Park will really kick in if/when Ruben Amorim gets the tin tack.",
      "",
      "Postecoglou’s football is high-risk, high-reward and the larger body of Premier League evidence does now point to it being quite dramatically and fundamentally flawed at this level.",
      "And that was when he was deploying it with a Spurs squad far better suited to the approach than Nottingham Forest’s, especially in terms of defensive pace, mobility and technical ability.",
      "While it’s all smiles now between Postecoglou and Marinakis, it’s really not that hard to imagine a world where that all changes very, very quickly. Heavy defeats at Arsenal can and do happen to anyone, but it was an inauspicious start nonetheless for a manager whose methods have suffered a further blow by the speed and extent with which Spurs have improved basic things like ‘defending set-pieces’ and ‘attacking set-pieces’ and ‘having a midfield’ under Thomas Frank.",
      "",
      "It would have made Spurs’ decision to sack Europa League-winning Ange Postecoglou look positively kind, but there remains a decent case that Leeds – and Burnley for that matter – could or even should have thanked the managers who secured 100 Championship points and got them back into the big time and then sent them on their way.",
      "Farke had a dreadful Premier League record of only six wins and 26 points from his 49 games in charge of Norwich, a team he twice led to promotion from the Championship with 94 and 97 points.",
      "As well as fighting his own record in this competition, Farke faces the added burden of expectation levels very different to those at just about any other club that could possibly find itself promoted into the Premier League in this current era where that represents the most bittersweet of successes.",
      "Leeds do look far better prepared than most for attempting the now fiendishly difficult first-season survival at this time, as victory over a disappointingly passive Everton suggested, but Farke lasted 11 games of the 21/22 season with Norwich and something similar absolutely cannot be ruled out this time.",
      "Arsenal away needn’t be a season-defining fixture, but Leeds had absolutely nothing to offer in that one from the moment the Gunners got going, which doesn’t bode well for future games against teams who aren’t as confused as Everton apparently are.",
      "Leeds were quietly impressive in a goalless draw against a despair-laden Newcastle, but the lack of goal threat is inevitably a concern, as it was in a 1-0 defeat to Fulham.",
      "",
      "Wolves absolutely love a sh*tbone awful start and enforced managerial change around November. The loss of key players and a disappointingly limp finish to last season after that thrilling run of wins through March and April mean those old doubts were nagging away even before a woeful pre-season, an opening-day paddling from new-look, old-destructiveness Man City and further defeats to Bournemouth, Everton and now Newcastle United.",
      "Pereira should be fine after the work he did in steering Wolves so comfortably clear of any relegation trouble last season, but making terrible starts that leave them in apparent relegation trouble before surviving comfortably in the end appears to now be ingrained in the club culture, an issue that transcends players and managers.",
      "",
      "Feels like one could, if one were so inclined, make the case for him being both top and bottom of this list.",
      "Top because United were staggeringly and at times unwatchably bad last season, as well as bottling the Europa League final in truly dismal fashion against planet earth’s most notorious pot-dodgers. Bottom because United have so clearly and determinedly nailed their colours to the Amorim mast that even if they remain staggeringly and at times unwatchably awful they might just stick with him out of pure stubbornness.",
      "But can he survive defeat to Grimsby Town? Should he? Victory over Burnley helps, but it could scarcely have been less convincing. And my word, they looked broken against Manchester City.",
      "READ: Who will be the next Man Utd manager if Ruben Amorim is sacked?",
      "",
      "That’s what a 3-0 defeat to a newly-promoted club and a 5-1 battering by Chelsea will do to you after a summer where little has gone right for West Ham. Sunderland and Chelsea were both very good, but the Hammers were honking on the opening day and arguably even worse against the Blues, with the perfectly rational view that Potter could not and should not be judged until he’d had the chance to get a pre-season’s worth of ideas across to his players already floundering.",
      "Hard to think of many teams who’ve more thoroughly propelled themselves into full ‘You fear for them’ territory so early in the season.",
      "But that victory over Forest, coming as it did with Lucas Paqueta’s don’t-come-and-get-me plea was impeccably timed. It would’ve been an unmanageable international break void had they lost that. But any renewed optimism was dashed by an exposing defeat to Tottenham.",
      "Scholes claims Man Utd committed a “criminal offence” in the transfer window this summer and highlighted the “big issue” which remains unresolved under Amorim.",

      "Gotta hand it to Manchester United. In recent years, they’ve truly become the gift that keeps on giving. Rival fans used to have to work for a laugh — now all it takes is a glance at the back pages or a scroll through social media. I mean, was it ever this bleak for their supposed rivals? One went 30 years without a league title, the other nosedived to League One, and still neither descended into the meme-fodder pantomime United have mastered in the post-Fergie era.",
      "Which brings me to Ruben Amorim — or should I say, Agent Amorim?",
      "Now, we’ve all made jokes about certain managers being double agents, sent by rival clubs to sabotage from within. Usually tongue-in-cheek stuff. But with Amorim? Honestly, I’m not so sure anymore. The man’s a masterpiece of incompetence — or covert brilliance, depending how you look at it.",
      "People are piling on the poor guy, but let’s be fair — if a man this determined to get sacked still hasn’t been sacked, then maybe the problem isn’t just the manager, but the clowns upstairs running the circus.",
      "Let’s review the evidence:",
      "Eight PL wins in 31, a goal difference deeper in the red than their balance sheet. That gets you sacked in Sunday league. But at United, it’s just another chapter in the long, miserable saga of delusion over direction.",

      "Persistently selecting the same underperforming players week after week, ensuring fans enjoy that sweet, familiar taste of failure.",
      "They didn’t even qualify for Europe this season, so there wasn’t even the dignity of a Thursday night humbling in Moldova to cling to. Instead, they crashed out of the Carabao Cup courtesy of Grimsby Town, and are now left with just one competition to “focus on” — which, hilariously, doesn’t even start until January.",
      "All this after spending over £200 million in the summer — the fifth-highest spenders in Europe — yet somehow forgetting to buy a single competent defender. It’s like going shopping for a winter coat and coming back with five pairs of sunglasses!",
      "And in the middle of it all? Amorim, sat on the bench fiddling with his tactics board, like some abstract artist in the middle of a nervous breakdown. The pièce de résistance? Throwing Harry Maguire up top and calling it a “plan.”",
      "And when the tactical disasters and limp performances weren’t enough, he went full kamikaze in the post-match press conference — all but daring the board to sack him, saying, ‘You can’t change the system, you need to change the man.’ That’s not analysis — that’s a resignation letter read aloud, and they still didn’t take the hint.",
      "I mean… what more does a man have to do?",
      "He’s tanked the derby, served up dross weekly, mugged off his own board on live TV — and yet there he is, still on the payroll. If that’s not a metaphor for United, I don’t know what is.",

He didn’t even want to come mid-season. He can see his reputation as a bright young thing disintegrating before his eyes. Why didn’t he do another couple of years in Portugal, maybe off to PSG or Bayern.. Let him go. There’s hope for him, Sir Jim. Don’t make the captain go down with the ship..",
      "Seriously though, I’ve never seen a manager so clearly unhappy with his job. Nuno for instance would turn Man United around within a month or two, even with that squad. Play four at the back, three solid defensive mid, then 3 of Bruno, Amad, Mbuemo, Cunha, Sesko up front. It doesn’t even seem that hard. Is Amorim trying to be sacked?\nDan, London",
      "",
      "I am unsurprised by United fans calling for Amorim’s sack. But the real question is who do you want to replace him?",
      "Part of Amorim’s allure was he was a young manager, and he has now basically ruined his reputation with his managing of United. If I was an up-and-coming manager, I wouldn’t go anywhere near that club. It is a basket case. Also, your fans do not have the patience for young managers.",

It’d leave De Ligt in the middle on his own marking say Ekitike, so you cant do that. So who marks the wide forwards? Your wing backs, Dorgu and Diallo or Mazroui are taksed with defending and are pretty much nullified as a forward threat. So you’ve got 5 at the back with 3 ctr backs now marking 1 central striker.

      "The Red Devils finished last season in an incredibly low 15th position in the Premier League, while Amorim lost to Tottenham in the Europa League final, guaranteeing there would be no European football at Old Trafford this campaign.",
      "Man Utd have not started off this season well either, with the Red Devils taking four points from their opening four Premier League matches and are currently 14th in the early-season table.",

It does not show that Amorim is a WORSE manager than promoted managers Scott Parker or Daniel Farke, or new Brentford boss Keith Andrews, and especially not Ange Postecoglou, who has actually picked up a paltry 25 points from his last 31 Premier League games as manager of Tottenham and Nottingham Forest.",

Because United have made no such ‘decision’, of course. Because clubs do not make ‘decisions’ after every football match. That would be mental.",

      "And of course, the answer to that question is that they didn’t; they have decided he ‘set himself a two-year ultimatum to prove he is the right man for the job’ when he was appointed.",
      "You know and we know that you cannot set yourself an ‘ultimatum’; you can set yourself a target, or a deadline, or you can issue an ultimatum to somebody else.",

      "Sunday was the latest of many terrible days for Amorim at Man Utd, with his side on the end of a humbling 3-0 defeat at the hands of arch-rivals Manchester City.",
      "A tight derby was expected, as Man Utd and Man City each had a rough start to the 2025/26 campaign. But Pep Guardiola’s tactical approach exposed Amorim, who is the second favourite to be the next Premier League manager sacked, and helped his side earn a resounding victory, with United fortunate to avoid a more embarrassing deficit.",
      "Guardiola brought the game’s standout Jeremy Doku central in an unfamiliar role to outnumber Man Utd’s midfield, and this worked a treat as the flashy winger contributed assists for City’s opening two goals. Erling Haaland, meanwhile, capitalised on United’s shambolic loss of possession to score his second and his side’s third in a dominant display.",
      "This game provided further evidence that Amorim’s failing 3-4-3 system is not fit for purpose, as none of Man Utd’s players look better in this formation than under Erik ten Hag and they remain ineffective all across the pitch.",

      "Amorim also said that he “will do everything” to get Man Utd back on track and “always thinking about what is best for the club”, but he may be running out of time.",
      "It seems that this is the case if Romano’s comments are anything to go by; it hardly seems that Amorim has overwhelming backing.",
      "Romano avoided giving a clear answer when asked by GiveMeSport whether ‘Man Utd still have 100% belief?’ He responded: “It’s a difficult moment of course but Amorim wants to give his best for Man United, he’s convinced that with time he will sort things.”",
      "Yes, we know that Amorim will continue to “give his best” and as proven by his bullish but naive comments after the Manchester derby, he’s “convinced that with time he will sort things”, even if he and/or his system is not fit for purpose.",

      "The questions are obvious, the answers not so much. Because there really is nothing at the moment. Nothing to cling to that suggests thinking Ruben Amorim is suddenly going to crack it, that something is about to just click into place, is anything but a fantasy.",
      "We still see nothing from this United team that makes us think this is going to work out in the end.",

      "At this point it’s hard to see this as anything other than Amorim trying to at least escape from a miserable few months with a hefty pay-off. He’s now actively goading United into doing what really does look increasingly like the only way out of this latest mess.",
      "Another ruinously expensive mess into which hundreds of millions of pounds have been poured even as Sir Jim Ratcliffe goes around the rest of the business behaving like the broadest, most cartoonish billionaire villain.",
      "Because it just isn’t working. And doesn’t look like it ever will work, not in any reliable and consistent way that will suffice when this is after all Manchester United Football Club We’re Talking About.",
      "It appears obvious that something has to change and the manager has again made it plain the only way for that to happen is via his removal.",
      "But it’s never that simple. The quite possibly unsolvable equation United have to puzzle out now is whether they can afford to write off another few hundred million quid and start again, along with the even more vexing flipside of that particular equation: can they afford not to?",
      "The numbers now are just beyond stark. This is not a kneejerk reaction to a disappointing start to the season. After a painful Manchester derby defeat United have four points from four games this time around, which has maintained Amorim’s record at precisely one point per Premier League game.",
      "Go back before the last couple of seasons and their catastrophically ill-prepared and ill-equipped promoted teams, and you have a manager delivering what is now very nearly a season’s worth of relegation form.",
      "And the fact the promoted teams last season were so poor only exacerbates that fact, because three of the mere eight Premier League wins he’s managed at United came against those three historically, record-breakingly weak Premier League clubs. His only win this season came by the skin of his arse against another newly promoted and likely-to-be-relegated team.",
      "Against established, settled, solid Premier League opponents he has managed four wins from 26 games. And not only does he not appear to know how to address this problem, he appears at best dimly aware that a problem exists or that locating a solution is within his purview.",
      "The system just isn’t working. Even after a summer of huge investment, the squad just still isn’t in the shape required for Amorim’s methods.",
      "Much of the focus has been on the back three, and with some reason, because all too often United appear to have the requisite numbers back in defence but find themselves played through and around with embarrassing ease, all while making that same task against fewer defenders look impossibly difficult at the other end.",
      "United are pot-committed to a system where they cannot create clear chances at one end or prevent clear chances at the other. And yet the biggest mess of all, the root of those problems at either end of the pitch, lies in midfield, where Amorim is still trying to play the football he played at Sporting while having nothing like the profile of agile, mobile midfielder that made it all possible.",
      "Manuel Ugarte still hasn’t cracked it, Kobbie Mainoo has had his confidence shredded, selling Scott McTominay continues to look in hindsight like one of the greatest transfer blunders of all time because he would be absolutely ideal in there, and worst of all Bruno Fernandes is being deployed as the ultimate square peg in a round hole in a midfield role that makes both him and the team markedly worse.",
      "It’s not in any way the only problem for United, but the fact almost a year into the Amorim project their best player is still one who has no obvious natural place anywhere in the manager’s system is damning and maddening.",
      "Amorim has fallen out with countless players, and fallen out hard. Those that leave almost always seem to find themselves rejuvenated elsewhere – Andre Onana the latest after a starring role on debut for Trabzonspor.",
      "Meanwhile players come in having starred elsewhere and almost instantly become shadows of their former selves. There’s a reverse alchemy at play with United right now that is sinking the club and its players. And most of all its manager.",

They are the poorest team in the league. It’s like there’s a curse on the club. They were beaten by a City team that was only stirring from its slumbers, like United weren’t even there. It was a nothing of a performance. There, but somehow absent. And no one cared at all. In fact, they gave a good impression of not giving a damn.",
      "Clearly having a clueless airhead in the boardroom who doesn’t know sh*t from sugar but is deluded into thinking he does – despite proof to the contrary – does not help. And these players might not be elite but they must be better than this to even be professionals. And the manager, while seemingly helpless, can’t be so very bad. No, it’s more existential than that. It’s like a corrupting gas that all who breathe are brought low by. Every player, every signing, every manager.",

Confused, ineffectual and downright ugly, looking like an old man who still thinks computers are modern which run on Windows 95.",

They had the whole team in the defensive third for the first goal but they might as well have not bothered, Bruno Fernandes just watching Phil Foden have a free header. His favourite system, such as it is, can’t be said to be especially complicated or hard to learn but it still just looks like a total mess. I don’t believe they understand it. They’re all over the place, as though they are strangers. They’re absolutely stealing a highly waged living by playing like this.",
      "It may be down to players’ inability to adapt to the system, or has he failed to tell them how to play it? That seems unlikely because what else has he got to do with his time? Results suggest the players have no idea what to do and are far too stupid or unwilling to learn. What else could it be? They are making a fool out of him. Why stick with something that manifestly doesn’t work? Then again, there’s no evidence they’d be any better in any other style. They look weak and disorganised, whatever players start.",
      "After there was the usual pathetic, simpering, sorrowful, in-the-headmasters-office-style Bruno Fernandes interview after yet another hapless loss confirming the weak. spineless nature of the whole club. That someone so lacking in spirit or resilience is the captain, speaks volumes. Fancy giving such wet flannel an inspirational role, let alone an organisational one when their organisation is repeatedly poor.",
      "He actually said we need to score more goals and concede less! Duh! Everything he always says they must do, they never do. And I don’t believe any of them care anymore. In his post-game interview he referred to United as a big club. That’s part of the problem. There’s a cognitive dissonance between their position and reputation.",
      "Eight wins from 31 games and a 25% win ratio is some shade of terrible for any side. 31 points from 31 games. Bottom of the 17 sides in the league since his arrival.",
      "Whatever the nature of the club actually is, it all must be forced to change. Until it does they’ll be stuck in purgatory as one of the worst, most unattractive teams in the league and the only way it can change is to be relegated, jettison the idiotic, clueless and hated Worzel Gummidge and the undead greedy be-wigged Glazer family. Clear the decks of every leech and undeserving player.",
      "Just hanging on, endlessly wasting fortunes, is getting nowhere. Embrace failure, accept you’re no good and start again with low-profile players and a low-profile manager. It won’t happen of course. They club is too self-regarding and cowardly. So while it’s just a phase, it’s set to be a long one.",

I don’t have much sympathy for him in the fact he’s starting Shaw each match, but doesn’t start Mainoo or Heaven. The team needs some bloody energy, and he starts Casemiro and Shaw most matches who are the opposite of fitness and energy. I can’t get my head around how he’s starting Shaw, especially after the Europa League loss last year. Martinez is needed but unfortunately made of biscuits.",

Nothing wrong with ensuring the midfield is setup strong to control the game better. Most managers will get a lot more out of this team with a midfield trio of Casemiro/ Ugarte / Mainoo; Mount/Cunha/Fernandes can be back ups for the Mainoo position. Put a defensive midfielder with legs from the academy as a backup to Casemiro/Uagrte. Surely it can’t be worse than this.",

      "– People who back him and pointing to the summer transfer window that we didn’t get a midfielder should understand that even with Baleba or any other midfielder, Ruben is not going to get the right results. Still he will expect Dorgu or any wingback for that matter to be the man to create all our chances.",
      "– He will(should) go during the next Intl’ break. The longer he stays the worse it is for our league position as it is with fear that we as fans approach every game. The only winnable fixture in the upcoming games is Sunderland at home as far as I see. By then we could’ve lost or not won in 3 on the bounce.",
      "I’m sorry but I just don’t see Amorim turning things around for us. It’s just that his benchmark is too low that 2 wins on the bounce will be a turnaround as far as his tenure is concerned.\nVasanthan Coimbatore, TN, India",
      "",
      "No one ever won anything without a decent defence, and defence starts in midfield.",
      "Another for the very long list of reasons why Bruno can’t play CM if we ever hope to be successful, along with classic ball watching for the first half goal. It’s not his fault, he’s not defensively aware. So don’t pick him there FGS. Mainoo eventually comes on and immediately makes a better more defensively aware partnership with Ugarte, while making driving runs. Who’d have thunk.",
      "Shaw is also not a regular CB, a fill-in at best. If he can’t play LWB, then get rid or keep as cover. He’s a capable tackler and passer but he switches off and always has. Just play Heaven or Fredricson. Give them minutes to develop. As for Maguire, he remains barely a footballer. He’d be embarrassed in the Championship. 2 chances given up in 12 minutes after coming on fresh. Impressive work! It is quite funny watching him try to run though. I’ve seen grannies move faster at bingo.",
      "At least Mbeumo looks handy. I feel sorry for the guy. Sesko too, who inevitably lacked service while taking up good positions.",
      "Modelling of the season based on current set up and players suggested that the best we’ll do is 9th and worst 11th. Literally couldn’t get more midtable. No club with aspirations should accept that and no amount of “trust the process” should change that.\nBadwolf",

      "Ruben Amorim has promised he won’t change his footballing philosophy and his bosses at Manchester United have no plans to change the head coach.",
      "The club has a long-term plan and while there is obvious and growing frustration with results, there will be no knee-jerk reaction or regular reassessment of the head coach's future after every defeat - however loud the noise grows from outside.",
      "Since Sir Alex Ferguson left 12 years ago, there have been two caretakers, and eight 'substantive' bosses. There is no desire to start afresh with a ninth.",
      "With four points from their opening four games, United have endured their worst start to a Premier League season since 1992/93. They also went out of the Carabao Cup - one of only three competitions they had the chance to win in 2025-26 - against Grimsby Town of League Two.",
      "This, after last season which saw their lowest ever Premier League points tally (42), and their most Premier League defeats (15).",
      "It is painful to watch. Amorim acknowledges and understands the supporters are hurting, but he says he is suffering still more as he battles to turn things around.",
      "He knows that his bosses are patient, and that they are realistic in their assessment that there are no quick fixes at Old Trafford. But there is also a recognition on all sides that currently things are far from good enough.",
      "There is no doubt Pep Guardiola's team definitively deserved the victory, and there is dismay at the three goals United conceded - with Erling Haaland's second a particularly tough one to swallow after the visitors vacated their entire defensive half to allow the Norwegian striker to run through unchecked.",
      "But there is pragmatism in the Old Trafford boardroom too recognising that, had Bryan Mbeumo's wondrous volley not been met with an equally wonderful Gianluigi Donnarumma save when the score was 2-0, or had Casemiro not missed a sitter at the back post later on in the game - there might have been a better gloss to the result.",
      "Amorim and the United hierarchy feel they are losing out on the fine margins right now.",
      "There are other mitigating circumstances too - the injuries to Mason Mount and Matheus Cunha are particularly damaging, especially because United's squad doesn't have the strength in depth of any of the other \"Big Six\" clubs right now.",
      "It will take several transfer windows and clever recruitment before that is a reality. Mount and Cunha should both be back available soon.",
      "Benjamin Sesko is still adapting to life in the Premier League, but there is optimism that he is beginning to feel more comfortable - albeit with very limited service. That was his first Premier League start for United on Sunday.",
      "Amorim's stubbornness over his playing system - with a defiant three centre backs - is very much a live debate. \"When I want to change my philosophy, I will change,\" the manager said on Sunday evening. \"If not, you have to change the man.\"",
      "It is not the first time that he has effectively said \"back me or sack me\" in front of the media. But when Amorim was appointed in November last year, the United hierarchy knew what they were getting, and the specific way in which the Portuguese coach chooses to play.",
      "There remains a belief, beyond Amorim's coaching staff, that the system can be a success.",
      "But there is some consternation that, with United's midfield struggling to hold its own so far this season, Amorim is repeatedly overlooking the talent of Kobbie Mainoo.",
      "The midfielder looked bright when he came off the bench for the last 30 minutes against City, and that again has prompted many a United fan to ask why he is yet to start a Premier League game this season.",
      "What is clear is that Amorim doesn't think he is the finished article and that, at 20-years-old, he still needs to develop. The United boss is working hard and personally with Mainoo behind the scenes, but rightly or wrongly - Mainoo's involvement will be managed. He is not currently in Amorim's first-choice line-up.",
      "For the Manchester United bosses, they feel little has changed after this weekend's game against their bitter rivals. That is not to say they will wait for change indefinitely. Rather, they accept that correcting United's malaise is a long-term project.",
      "And there is little or no desire to rip up the current plan, change the man in charge of the football team, and start (again) from scratch.",
      "Club legends are lining up to say enough is enough - Wayne Rooney, Roy Keane, Gary Neville and more among the voices saying the pressure on Amorim is mounting, and things have to improve quickly.",
      "That is true. And no one knows it more acutely than Ruben Amorim himself."

      "\"But he is being asked to do something different. It is normal for a No 10 like he is to be able to do it for two or three games, to fill in when a midfielder is injured or suspended or something. But then you get a little bit bored of going back into position to defend.\"",
      "It is the voice of experience. \"I did both roles. As a No 10, the last thing you want to think about is defending. Once you go back into a two in midfield, all of a sudden you are thinking about defence, about what your runner is doing. It's a totally different mindset.\"",
      "There is a view now that Scholes was a natural deep-lying playmaker, England's answer to Andrea Pirlo or Xavi Hernandez. It is true that he took on that role late in his career but, now 50 and reflecting on his career, it is not necessarily how he sees himself.",
      "\"When I first came into the team I was a centre-forward,\" he recalls. And while Sir Alex Ferguson had always insisted that he would end up playing as a central midfielder, that took time. \"I ended up playing as a No 10 for three, four, five years, which I loved.\"",
      "They were some of his happiest and most successful years. \"Defending was not my strong point. I didn't like having to think about defending and as a No 10 you didn't have to. All you think about is getting your team to play, creating chances, scoring goals.\"",
      "In truth, the obsession with possession was never his. When watching old clips, he has been known to groan at the sight of himself passing backwards. \"It was not until my late twenties when I went into that controlling role as the manager wanted me to do.\"",
      "It required a mentality shift. \"I remember a game against Bayern Munich in the Champions League where he did not really want me to go over the halfway line, which was something different for me, because we were getting done in Europe quite a bit.\"",
      "Scholes' job was not to unlock the opposition but to stifle them. \"He wanted us to just be controlled and not vacate that area. It was something new for me to learn.\" Even now, he still recalls his surprise at the United manager's reaction to his performance.",
      "\"I remember after that game, I had not had a shot on goal and I don't think I created a chance. I didn't do anything attacking wise very well. He said, 'Brilliant, that is what I wanted from you'. From that day on, it just seemed to grow. I became used to the role.\"",
      "As such, you might expect Scholes to be an advocate for Fernandes making the same positional journey. The United skipper turned 31 this month, after all. Instead, it seems he would prefer the Portuguese playmaker to be the one still trying that killer pass.",
      "\"That is the way I was brought up. That is the way the manager wanted us to play. Pass forward and run forward. It was all about playing attacking, being entertaining. So, to go back, just passing it back, I hate seeing it now and I hated seeing it when I did it.\"",
      "In a wide-ranging conversation at a Manchester pub where he is even volunteering to pull pints to help promote his new podcast The Good, the Bad and the Football with fellow Class of '92 graduate Nicky Butt, Scholes touches on subjects old and new.",
      "He has been following the debate about the relative merits of Michael Owen and Wayne Rooney as teenagers. Scholes played with both. Owen even nicked the ball off his toe when scoring his wonder goal against Argentina in 1998. \"He could have left it for me.\"",
      "His own view? Succinct but definitive. \"At that age, Michael was the better goalscorer, Wayne was the better footballer.\"",
      "But he is keen to stress that Owen was a phenomenon in his own right, his pace setting him apart from the rest. \"With Michael in the early days, I just had to look and he would spin in behind and I just had to hit the ball into 20 yards of space. It was an easy job.\"",
      "Easy for Scholes, perhaps. He had a connection with many top-class strikers for club and country. \"As a midfield player you need to know your players' strengths.\" But Ruud van Nistelrooy was his favourite. \"I had the feeling that I knew what he wanted to do.\"",
      "Scholes wonders whether too much is being expected of the latest United striker Benjamin Sesko. Will he really be able to succeed where Rasmus Hojlund failed? \"He is a 22-year-old kid replacing someone of a very similar ilk. It is a difficult job to adapt.\"",
      "He would have liked the club to opt for a more experienced goalkeeper such as Emiliano Martinez too. \"He would have been a lot safer.\" And that is crucial. Scholes saw up close the difficulties that the club faced in trying to find a replacement for Peter Schmeichel.",
      "He is reluctant to criticise Massimo Taibi too much. \"He made a couple of mistakes. It did not work out.\" But he is less delicate on Mark Bosnich's footwork. \"Would he be able to play in this day and age for some of the best coaches in the world? I don't see it.\"",
      "On United more broadly, Scholes describes himself as \"more hopeful than confident\" that Amorim can bring the good times back. \"I like the way he speaks,\" he says, before later adding: \"The results are not really there to have massive confidence in him yet.\"",
      "Perhaps he would have more confidence if Fernandes were given more freedom to express himself further forwards. \"If you watched some of the Europa League games last year, he was really good in that [deeper] position so he can do it,\" says Scholes.",
      "\"I think if you asked him to do everything then he would try to do it all, almost in that Wayne Rooney type of way as well. But I think with him playing in that deeper-lying area it is taking away some of the important qualities that he has further up the pitch.\"",
      "Paul Scholes. Still a No 10 at heart.",

      "The Debrief column this week focuses on Patrick Dorgu's ineffectiveness despite getting in good positions for Manchester United and what that says about Ruben Amorim's system. Plus: Jeremy Doku's creativity and Brentford's long throws...",
      "Monday 15 September 2025 12:01, UK",
      "Being in Ruben Amorim's press conference after Manchester United's 3-0 defeat to Manchester City on Sunday, it was striking once again just how open that he is about his team's ongoing struggles. More than that, he is aware of what he calls the narratives.",
      "There were more questions about Bruno Fernandes, while Amorim himself referenced the debate about Kobbie Mainoo. But more troubling for the United coach is the growing feeling that even if he succeeds in shaping this side in his own image, it might not work.",
      "Patrick Dorgu's role in the derby was fascinating. He had more touches in the opposition penalty box than any other player on the pitch. In fact, with 12 touches there, he became the first United player to hit double figures in the area so far this season.",
      "So often the space was his. But he was not particularly effective. There was one completed dribble. Crosses were looped in. But even late in the game, with City having long since sealed the points, there was a toothlessness to United in the final third.",
      "It seems extraordinary to think that this is by design but that is how it can feel with Amorim's United. So much depends on the quality of the wing-backs in this system but even though Dorgu is seen as a specialist in the role, does he have the tools required?",
      "Two seasons ago, the player to find themselves in the most one-on-one situations in the Premier League was Arsenal's Bukayo Saka. Last season, it was Liverpool's Mohamed Salah. This suits those teams. Get your best player isolated against the opposition.",
      "The United player to have found themselves in the most one-on-one situations is Dorgu. If that is the plan with Amorim's 3-4-3 then it is a concern because on Sunday that is probably the United player Pep Guardiola would have wanted to have the space.",
      "Any system that compromises the strengths of your most talented players and highlights the deficiencies of your most limited ones is surely doomed to fail. For Amorim, the wing-backs are key. And Manchester United's are not good enough to make this work.",
      "For proof that isolating a wide player against the opposition defence can be effective, look no further than the other end of the pitch and a hugely impactful performance by Jeremy Doku who provided assists for Manchester City's first two goals of the game.",
      "Jack Grealish's improved end product has been a feature of the Premier League season, racking up four assists already since joining Everton on loan from Manchester City. But Doku's impressive display in the Manchester derby was a reminder of his talent.",
      "The Belgian forced himself ahead of Grealish in the mind of Pep Guardiola and certainly justified his inclusion against Manchester United. It was Doku's skill that opened up the defence for Phil Foden's opening goal, dancing past two opponents to set it up.",
      "Guardiola has described the winger as the best in the world over five metres and that explosivity was the key factor in that goal but the City boss has urged him to improve other facets of his game and there was some evidence of that with his second assist.",
      "It was his measured pass through to Erling Haaland that ended any hopes of a United comeback. It is the first time that Doku has registered two assists in a Premier League game since producing four of them in one game against Bournemouth in 2023.",
      "Grealish, who had a season-high 16 touches in the opposition box in Everton's goalless draw with Aston Villa, still ranks second for chances created from open play in the Premier League so far this season, but the one man ahead of him on that list is Doku.",
      "The return of the long throw remains a big talking point in this Premier League season but after Crystal Palace found the net as a result of one against Aston Villa before the international break, it was time for the masters of it to make their own statement.",
      "Brentford's stoppage-time equaliser against Chelsea was finished by Fabio Carvalho but it came from a Kevin Schade long throw. According to the expected-goals data, the Bees have now created better chances from throw-ins than any other team this season.",
      "No surprise there. That was the case last season, and the season before that, and the season before that, and the season before that. Other teams are finally cottoning on to the fact that the throw-in is an opportunity to do more than just recycle possession.",
      "\"It is not new to us,\" said Brentford boss Keith Andrews. How true. Over the past five seasons, their expected-goals tally from throw-ins is 21.47. The next best in the Premier League in that period is just 5.49 by Nottingham Forest. The rest are playing catch up.",
      "Speaking recently to Thomas Gronnemark, the renowned throw-in specialist who has worked with Brentford for the past three seasons, he believes that this is inevitable because paying attention to the importance of this set piece just makes sense.",

      "Monday 15 September 2025 12:01, UK",
      "This is as bad as it gets unless you were watching Man Utd in the 1970s when they were relegated.",
      "Here's the thing, though, United fans who were there have great memories of that 1974/75 season in the Second Division. Tommy Docherty was in charge and there were new grounds to visit.",
      "The team still had players you could look up to like Stuart Pearson, Lou Macari, Sammy McIlroy and Brian Greenhoff. Despite playing in the second tier United still had the highest average home attendance in England.",
      "After an instant return to the First Division, United also denied Liverpool the Treble a year later by beating Bob Paisley's side in the 1977 FA Cup final.",
      "Even in the 1980s when United went through long dark periods, they still had teams full of club legends like Bryan Robson, Norman Whiteside, Mark Hughes and Paul McGrath.",
      "In recent years there have been so many changes at every level of the club that it's difficult to put your finger on what makes United that special anymore.",
      "Of course, there is the history and the trophies and the fans. More than 2.2m of them watched games at Old Trafford last season. There wasn't much to celebrate with United finishing 15th in the Premier League, but that made them the best supported team in Europe.",
      "Many of those fans will not have been around in the 1970s and 1980s so for them this is definitely as bad as it gets. And that's a view that would probably be shared by at least some of the older fans who were there in those days.",
      "Ruben Amorim was defiant in Sunday's post-match press conference after his side's 3-0 defeat to Man City, and made it clear, again, that he is not going to change his philosophy.",
      "No matter how bad things get, it seems he will carry on playing three at the back even though it is pretty obvious to everyone that the system is not working and it does not suit his players.",
      "If nobody at United can convince him to be more flexible, then they just have to hope the players will eventually look at home playing the way Amorim wants them to play.",
      "The only other option is to replace the head coach, but that it is a road United have been down too often since Sir Alex Ferguson stepped down 12 years ago.",
      "You could make a pretty good case that United would be in a better state if they had stuck with any of the managers who followed Ferguson: David Moyes, Louis van Gaal, Jose Mourinho, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and Erik ten Hag.",
      "Although, judging by the fact that they wasted so much money in the transfer market when Ten Hag was in charge, perhaps it was the right decision to sack him nine months ago, when United were 14th - exactly where did they are today.",
      "Even Ten Hag, though, could point out that since Amorim's first game in charge, no ever-present Premier League team have performed worse than United - 31 points from 31 games means United are bottom of the table.",
      "Not if he only has one way of playing.",
      "The Premier League is ferociously competitive and United are too easy to play against at the moment. Opponents know exactly what to expect when they face United and the fear factor has totally disappeared.",
      "It used to be a shock when United lost; now it is a shock when they win. So-called smaller clubs are better run, have better balanced squads and can spend tens of millions of pounds on players every summer.",
      "United have been left behind and Amorim has a massive job on his hands. He is a man who wears his heart on his sleeve and comes across as extremely honest and transparent in all his dealings with the media. That is a breath of fresh in one sense, but it can also diminish his status as a strong leader.",
      "Managing Manchester United is like managing Real Madrid. Everything you say is going to be a headline. United are back-page news every day.",
      "Perhaps the ideal United head coach is someone who wears a suit and tie and gives little away. It worked in the old days, but these are not the old days any more.",
      "It is too early to answer that question properly because the window closed only two weeks ago.",
      "United focused their spending on buying a new forward line when many outside observers would have thought that the money would have been better spent on a new spine for the team. They also had the option of selling Bruno Fernandes for a big transfer fee to Al Hilal in Saudi Arabia.",
      "The captain stayed and his new team-mates Benjamin Sesko, Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo need to be given more time to show what they can do. Senne Lammens could also turn out to be an exceptional goalkeeper if he lives up to expectations and adapts to English football.",
      "There is a nagging feeling, though, that a club the size and stature of United should be going all out to buy the best players in the world - players like Gianluigi Donnarumma.",
      "Not being in the Champions League and cutting the wage bill means United fans have to get used to a new reality, a new reality which means the very best players going to their rivals for the time being.",
      "Even the fact that United managed to move out so many players this summer who were surplus to requirements was not a cause for celebration. United have taken a big financial hit on the transfer fees paid for the likes of Rasmus Hojlund, Jadon Sancho and Antony but at least they were able to get their wages off their books.",
      "United were sixth in the table when INEOS completed their deal to buy their minority stake and take over sporting control in February last year.",
      "There has been very little to get excited about on the pitch, apart from a shock FA Cup final win against Manchester City, which earned Ten Hag a new contract but left United counting the cost - some £13m - when they fired him just five months later.",
      "There's no point going through all the statistics and defeats here - there are too many losses - but it is safe to say that this has been one of the worst periods in the history of the club.",
      "INEOS have put their own money in and are making big changes off the pitch, including redeveloping the training ground, but there have been just as many mistakes as good decisions. With the benefit of hindsight, flying to Ibiza to give Ten Hag a new deal was absolutely the wrong decision and hiring and firing Dan Ashworth was another costly mistake.",
      "At least INEOS have a plan. The plan changes from time to time as all plans do, but they do have a plan and they have put their own money on the table. It is just extremely unfortunate that the plan has also meant so many people losing their jobs and a new controversial ticketing policy.",
      "The Glazer family also had a plan and if you wanted to start an argument, you could whisper very quietly that the results, league tables and trophies, taken in isolation, show that United were better off when the Glazers and executives like Ed Woodward and Richard Arnold were in charge.",
      "The priority has to be getting back into the Champions League or any European competition at the very least.",
      "The League Cup is already gone thanks to that calamitous night in Grimsby and you can get odds of 100/1 on United to win the title so, trophy wise, the FA Cup is all United realistically have to play for.",
      "Winning the FA Cup would mean a place in the Europa League, but the Champions League is where United have to be. The commercial benefits of being back in the expanded top-tier European tournament are huge and it would make it easier to sign the best players in the world.",
      "Finishing in the top five is likely to mean Champions League qualification but United are a long way off that standard at the moment. At least the lack of European competition this season means Amorim has more time to work with his players in between league games. It is not much of a silver lining, but it is something at least.",
      "United's next game is against Chelsea next weekend. Luckily for them, Chelsea have a terrible record at Old Trafford - no league win for 12 years - and they were not particularly convincing in their 2-2 draw with Brentford on Saturday night.",
      "The six teams below United at the moment are all capable of beating them but that is not to say United are in a relegation fight - yet.",
      "If they carry on the way they have started, they will probably end up where they finished last season - in the middle of the bottom half of the table.",
      "And if that is the case, it is likely that INEOS will make a change at the top - just as they did last October when United were 14th."

      "However, although the sharp looks remain the same, there is something different emerging: substance.",
      "This isn't the same Parker that arrived in the Premier League lacking in realism. The Burnley Parker has learnt things that the Fulham Parker and the Bournemouth Parker missed. He's taken the bruises of those experiences and turned them into something closer to a blueprint. There's a tactical flexibility to Parker now.",
      "The pragmatism and defensive unity his Burnley team showed for 94 minutes against Liverpool is going to be key to their survival. Parker knows this now and you'd be hard pushed to see a better organised defensive showing from a team all season. They were exemplary.",
      "This could just be the Premier League job where Parker proves everyone wrong.Lewis Jones",
      "Ruben Amorim remains defiant about his unwillingness to deviate tactically but that now feels like a tactical decision in itself. He knows that he has gone too far down this path to have any credibility if he abandons his idea. He is on this journey to its end.",
      "\"There are a lot of things that you have no idea what happened during these months, but I accept that,\" Amorim said in his press conference. \"I am not going to change. When I want to change my philosophy, I will change. If not, you have to change the man.\"",
      "The problem is that football management is a confidence trick. The players need to believe and there is little reason for them to do so. Eight wins from 31 games means no team in the Premier League who has been there throughout his reign have fewer points.",
      "Against Manchester City, they were in it until the 53rd minute but once it unravelled the frailty was evident, the midfield overrun. Bruno Fernandes was again forced into a deeper role from which he struggled to influence things. Square pegs, round holes.",
      "Benjamin Sesko cut an isolated figure on his full Premier League debut and Patrick Dorgu, the specialist wing-back recruited for that particular role on the left, was not efficient enough with his crossing to threaten the City back line as he might have done.",
      "Amorim saw positives. \"I see that we are doing better, but then the results do not show that.\" He again held up the Arsenal defeat as proof that his way can work. But when even losses are viewed as progress, one is entitled to ask where he is leading them.",
      "United have never had a worse start to a Premier League campaign than this. And yet, that hardly feels shocking anymore. Amorim insists he is suffering more than anyone. The problem for United is that the evidence of that suffering ending remains paper thin.Adam Bate",
      "Super 6 are starting the season by guaranteeing a £1,000,000 winner! Play for free."
