      "Manchester United are hoping for a clean slate this season after their disastrous 2024-25 campaign and it's been a case of so far, so good as far as this pre-season is concerned.",
      "Ruben Amorim has taken his players for a tour of the United States and they are yet to lose a game in pre-season, though the coach will primarily be focusing on the squad's fitness levels and how they are adapting to his tactics.",
      "United have wrapped up the signings of Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha for big money fees and both players started against Everton on Sunday, though after a 2-2 draw it showed Amorim still has work to do on the best way to accommodate his new stars.",
      "The performance was probably United's worst of pre-season so far but Amorim's side certainly have shown signs of improvement since last season and they still have another friendly to come against Fiorentina before their huge Premier League opener against Arsenal on August 17.",
      "What United need from their captain is to be blunt and tell it like it is and that's exactly what they've got from Bruno Fernandes.",
      "The Portugal star was at risk of leaving after an approach from Saudi club Al-Hilal and fans will be grateful he decided to stay put - because he is exactly the kind of figure this team needs to get back to the level they desire.",
      "Even after a friendly game, Fernandes showed he wasn't happy with the performance and accused his team-mates of being \"lazy\" during the game - even though United ended up winning the Premier League Summer Series.",
      "United twice relinquished the lead after Fernandes himself scored from the penalty spot before Mason Mount put the team back ahead in the second half - with Iliman Ndiaye and an Ayden Heaven goal pegging them back.",
      "\"It’s improving, but it’s not where we want it to be,” Fernandes said. “It’s a game of football, there’s always passion there. Whatever happens, happens. There was nothing spicy there, it’s normal, it is part of the game.",
      "\"It’s been positive [the US tour] and it’s good to create a bond with the players. We looked a bit lazy today and we need to change that.\"",
      "Fernandes' bold and brutal comments will stand United in good stead for the season to come as it shows he won't stand for any more sloppiness for the team - something they cannot afford if they want to push on as a club.",
      "United only have two new signings so far and most supporters will tell you they needed arrivals from across the board given their woeful season. Despite being unbeaten in pre-season, it's been obvious this summer that United are crying out for more depth.",
      "Starting from the back of the team, it's clear United are lacking a new goalkeeper given Andre Onana's injury and question marks over his back-up Altay Bayindir, who is thought to want more regular game time.",
      "Onana has also come under fire for some high profile errors and United could really do with more competition in between the sticks, while the team could also do with more depth in defence and midfield - not to mention up front after the clear struggles in attack last season.",
      "Fernandes spoke about the need for more signings in his rant after the Everton game and said the team were crying out for more competition to help the players up their game.",
      "\"I don’t want to have a dig at anyone, but I think the club is doing the best they can in terms of all the financial situations they talk about,\" he said. \"I don’t know about it, I’m not involved in that. But obviously it was crystal clear we needed more competition for the players that were here.",
      "“We needed more quality to get everyone to step up a bit more and to have more to do to get into the starting line-up. I think that’s what the club and the manager are trying to do and hopefully we can get one or two players more to help with that.”",
      "Benjamin Sesko is just one of the players United are interested in and they have already opened talks with Red Bull Leipzig over his signature - but face stiff competition from Newcastle, who can offer him Champions League football.",
      "United lined up with Mbeumo and Cunha in attack against Everton as Amorim took a tactical gamble by playing a 3-4-1-2 formation, but neither player is an out-and-out centre-forward and prefer being out wide.",
      "The team will be deadly if they can get Mbeumo and Cunha either side of a clinical finisher like Sesko, who fired in 21 goals in all competitions last season and 18 in the season before. He is currently rated at £70m.",
      "United still have Rasmus Hojlund and Joshua Zirkzee at their disposal, but the later is currently injured and the former still has a long way to go in showing he is dependable.",
      "Hojlund did score in the 4-1 friendly win over Bournemouth and the fact he has been included in United's travelling group in the United States - and not left behind with \"the bomb squad\" of unwanted players - shows Amorim still has faith in him.",
      "Recent reports have claimed that Amorim believes the arrival of a top class striker like Sesko will bring out the best in Hojlund and force him to take his game to the next level.",
      "Having the two players in the team - alongside Mbeumo and Cunha and existing talent like Amad - can give United a new layer of firepower this season and that might be the difference to push the team up the table.",
      "Amorim has shown that once he falls out with a player, it is difficult to find a way back and it appears the ship has sailed with Alejandro Garnacho.",
      "Garnacho wasn't happy with his manager after he dropped him for the Europa League final and immediately suggested he wanted out of United - with the player subsequently left out of the club's pre-season tour.",
      "He has been strongly linked with a move to Aston Villa or Chelsea in this window and with a move yet to come to fruition, Amorim suggested that any United player who was currently frozen out had a chance of being reintegrated if they didn't find a new club.",
      "But his recent comments on Garnacho suggests there is no going back in their relationship after he claimed their relationship simply didn't work - and he could not put his finger on why.",
      "\"I think Garnacho, you can understand and you can see, he's talented, he's a really talented boy,\" Amorim said. \"And sometimes things don't work out. You cannot explain specifically what it is.",
      "\"But I have the feeling, I think it's clear that Garnacho wants a different thing with a different leadership. And I can understand that. So I think it's not a problem.",
      "\"Sometimes you adapt to one guy, you have the connection. Other times, you want a new challenge. So, we try to make everything okay to all the parts. To the club, to the coach and to the players. So, it's a natural thing in football.\"",
      "Just like Fernandes, you want your manager to be a no-nonsense coach that pulls no punches and takes no prisoners.",
      "Amorim has raised eyebrows at Old Trafford with his candid statements on the team and brutal assessments about where they are at this moment in time. That's all fine, but those words have to be followed up with action on the pitch.",
      "He's already admitted this is the 'worst Manchester United team in history\" and recently said he knew his team would struggle in games last season, but luckily he is making moves to overhaul the squad to combat their woes.",
      "Amorim has isolated the players who he feels don't gel in his squad and aren't part of his plans - Rashford, Garnacho, Jadon Sancho, Antony and Tyrell Malacia - while Christian Eriksen, Victor Lindelof and Jonny Evans have left on free transfers.",
      "He's brought in two new signings and is plotting more - and revealed he was happy with the improvement he's seen from the team this summer so far.",
      "But his lengthy recent interview also set out his ambition and long-term plans for United after claiming he wanted to stay at Old Trafford for 20 years and follow in Sir Alex Ferguson's footsteps. It remains to be seen whether he can bring success to the club in the long term, but his attitude and bold steps he's taken certainly gives the team of chance of reaching that.",
      "\"I want to stay, I want to stay 20 [years],\" Amorim said. \"That is my goal and I truly believe in that. Something will happen. It always does. In some moments I will be lucky.",
      "\"I had a lot of luck during my career as a manager and my idea is to stay for many years. But again we know that the results will dictate that. I know that last season I used all the credits but I'm ready to start fresh.\"",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Former Arsenal striker Charlie Nicholas has slammed Manchester United over their transfer business this summer. The Scotsman believes the likes of new Gunners star Christian Norgaard and Newcastle shot-stopper Aaron Ramsdale should've been pursued.",
      "Ruben Amorim's side have added two offensive weapons this window so far in the form of £62.5million Matheus Cunha and £71m Bryan Mbeumo. Teenage left-back Diego Leon has been their only other acquisition.",
      "A move for a striker seems on the cards with Benjamin Sesko, also a target for the Magpies, being priority No. 1 for the Red Devils. Yet Nicholas, who played over 175 times for Arsenal, has lambasted the club for what he believes to be a sub-par recruitment round, questioning why the likes of Ramsdale were not looked at.",
      "\"There are a lot of players out there, a whole list who I think would be better than what Manchester United currently have,\" Nicholas exclaimed to Sky Bet. \"I just don't know where they see themselves going.\"",
      "Nicholas went on to raise questions about two players who have made moves this summer for fees that wouldn't break the bank: Norgaard, who arrived at the Emirates in July for £12m, and Ramsdale, who joined Newcastle on loan from Southampton last week.",
      "\"If I was Manchester United, why didn't they go in for Christian Norgaard? It looks as if they've waited for two high-profile players,\" continued Nicholas.",
      "\"But I look at them and I think, why are not adding more players like Norgaard, or players who have played well at Bournemouth and Newcastle, you could disrupt things and see who's interested.",
      "\"There are so many pillars I just can't understand, the whole lack of authority defensively and what is the current situation with the goalkeeper?",
      "\"Why don't they go and get Aaron Ramsdale? He's qualified, he knows the circuit, he's English, experienced, and competitive. I know Ramsdale hasn't won too much, but it's not far off what United have won.",
      "\"I just don't see how they see what an upgrade means. I don't see Manchester United fans showing one bit of excitement as it stands right now, and it's getting close for them to get aggressive towards the club again.\"",
      "Securing the services of a new star between the sticks is supposedly on the Old Trafford agenda this summer after Andre Onana suffered a substandard campaign last time out.",
      "Aston Villa No. 1 Emi Martinez looks destined to wave goodbye to Villa Park, but a United loan proposal for the Argentine was reportedly rejected last month. Head coach Amorim was asked about the prospect of signing a new goalkeeper before the window closes, and didn't rule the proposition out.",
      "\"To hope is a strong word,\" Amorim responded when asked if he hoped to bring in a new keeper or striker. \"We are always looking to improve the team. And we have some characteristics that we would like to have. But again, it depends on the market. It depends on the sales. We'll see.\"",

      "Alan Shearer has pinpointed two key areas Manchester United must address in the transfer market – and it seems the club agree with his verdict. Ruben Amorim's side have completed two high-profile moves but the iconic striker believes the club still need several more new recruits at Old Trafford.",
      "United wasted no time in snapping up Matheus Cunha from Wolves after meeting his £62.5million price tag. Manager Ruben Amorim has since bolstered his forward line further by clinching a deal for ex-Brentford ace Bryan Mbeumo, which could reach £71m, with the forward making his first appearance in their draw with Everton on Sunday.",
      "United will be determined to bounce back from their woeful 15th-place finish last term and are eager to secure more signings before the transfer window shuts. However, Shearer has insisted that the club needs to bring in new players in two specific areas.",
      "\"Two good signings...they need at least another three, I would say,\" Shearer said on the Rest is Football podcast. \"They need a top-class centre-forward and goalkeeper.\"",
      "While Shearer commended United's recent acquisitions, Gary Lineker delivered a succinct five-word message to the recruitment team: \"They need a lot more. A lot more.\"",
      "It appears United may agree with Lineker and Shearer's assessments. The club are eyeing a move for RB Leipzig's sought-after striker Benjamin Sesko. The 22-year-old is also on Newcastle United's radar, with Leipzig reportedly demanding around £70m for the talented young forward.",
      "United are on the hunt for a new number nine to bolster their attacking options, despite Rasmus Hojlund's determination to keep his spot at Old Trafford. Sesko impressed last season with 21 goals and six assists in 45 appearances across all competitions, though Shearer has admitted that a move for striker would be a gamble.",
      "Shearer also suggested that United need to strengthen their goalkeeping options and it is an area of the team that has been the subject of speculation. The Sun have reported that United are searching for a new deputy to Andre Onana, with Antwerp's Senne Lammens emerging as a potential candidate.",
      "The implications of signing Lammens or another backup would likely impact Altay Bayindir's future at United. The 27-year-old joined the club from Fenerbahce, where he was captain, in 2023, but has since made only 11 appearances.",
      "On the field, United had reason to celebrate after clinching the Premier League Summer Series title following a 2-2 draw with Everton, adding to their victories over West Ham and Bournemouth. Post-match, captain Bruno Fernandes criticised the team for being \"a little bit lazy\", but Amorim had no qualms in supporting his captain's call for higher standards.",
      "\"It's saying that they understand the situation. So it's a good feeling. So tomorrow we are going to travel, one day off and we return to Carrington to work,\" Amorim said when asked about Fernandes' comments.",
      "\"Understanding that in this club everything is ups and downs. We understand that, but I prefer that feeling than the other side.\"",

      "Marcus Rashford is better than Nico Williams according to former Barcelona president, Joan Gaspart. The England international arrived at the Camp Nou on a season-long loan from Manchester United with a £26million option to buy earlier this summer, with his long-term future at Old Trafford far from certain.",
      "At 27 and in the prime of his playing career, Rashford will go down as one of the most impressive Manchester United academy graduates of all time, but that hasn't prevented him from falling out of favour with new boss, Ruben Amorim. Rashford was dropped by the Portuguese head coach midway through last season and subsequently went on loan to Aston Villa in February.",
      "With his future in the north west still up in the air, he has since joined Barcelona for the upcoming season. Rashford's journey to Catalonia was far from smooth sailing, however, with Barcelona seemingly favouring other top talents this summer before opting for the England international.",
      "Not only did Barcelona register an interest in Liverpool's Luis Diaz, only to be told that the Colombian wasn't for sale, but they also neared the completion of a deal for Athletic Club's Williams, which reportedly fell through at the eleventh hour due to a dispute with regards to a release clause and La Liga registration.",
      "Williams instead returned to Bilbao, before signing a 10-year extension which will see him at the Estadio de Sans Mames until 2035, while Barcelona landed Rashford on a temporary basis. And while many fans of the La Liga giants will be disappointed that they didn't sign Spain international Williams, Gaspart believes that Rashford is more talented than the 23-year-old left winger.",
      "Speaking to El 10 de Barca, Gaspart said: \"First of all, for me, Marcus Rashford is better than Nico. From here on, I don’t care what Inaki [Williams, Nico's brother] might say. The player has used us in a good way – he’s gotten a good contract, and I’m happy for him.",
      "\"I don’t understand Athletic’s anger. I’ve signed many players from Bilbao, and always got along with their president. This is in the past. We have to focus on the season and trust the squad and the exceptional coach we have.\"",
      "It comes as Inaki lambasted Barcelona for their handling of Williams' potential transfer, claiming that they orchestrated a \"media campaign\" to lure his younger brother away from Bilbao. He alleged: \"They launched a media campaign they thought would work. Many of the things said were lies. People weren’t fair to my brother this summer.\"",
      "He added: \"The external noise ruined a lot. At Athletic, we go about things quietly. We don’t leak false stories to pressure players,\" as well as: \"My brother had options everywhere. But he stayed. He’ll play with his family, friends, and girlfriend close by. That means more than money or trophies.\"",
      "Rashford made his unofficial debut for Barcelona in a pre-season friendly against Vissel Kobe last month. The Englishman entered the fray as a half-time substitute for Raphinha, but only graced the pitch for 30 minutes before he was substituted off.",
      "While the incident may have looked a little disrespectful from the outside looking in, manager Hansi Flick was quick to clear the air, explaining that it was a tactical decision to monitor the forward's fitness. He said after the 3-1 win: \"We're being very careful with Marcus because he just came from an injury and he hasn't started training completely with the ball.",
      "\"He's a week behind the others. He hasn't been training as much with the ball, and we want to look after him.\"",

      "Bruno Fernandes has made clear his frustrations with Manchester United during their pre-season tour but not everyone has borne the brunt of the captain's criticism. Fernandes scored in a pre-season meeting with Everton, but United's issues were laid bare as David Moyes' side earned a 2-2 draw.",
      "United's skipped argued United were \"lazy\" during the draw in the United States, as an Ayden Heaven own goal ensured the spoils were shared. Fernandes' fellow scorer Mason Mount is still in his team-mate's good books, though, with the captain sharing a photo of the pair on Instagram with the simple caption: \"my guy\".",
      "“It’s improving, but it’s not where we want it to be,” Fernandes said after the game against Everton. “It’s a game of football, there’s always passion there. Whatever happens, happens. There was nothing spicy there, it’s normal, it is part of the game.",

      "The praise for Mount comes ahead of what could be a pivotal season for the England international. Since joining from Chelsea in 2023, he has struggled with a number of injury setbacks but showed towards the end of last season why United were willing to pay big money for him.",
      "In two seasons as a United player, Mount has played less than 2,000 competitive minutes. He's till just 26, though, and has time to turn his Old Trafford career around.",
      "Speaking during United's pre-season tour, Mount outlined the ways in which United are aiming to put last season's struggles behind them. Amorim's side ended last term in 15th place, missing out on Europe for the first time in more than a decade.",
      "“From day one of pre-season, it's about standards and details within training, on and off the pitch, and really focusing on what we need to do to be better and to perform better,\" the midfielder said. \"We haven't done loads of analysis of last season. We looked at a few areas that we can improve on, but this is a new season, it's like wiping the slate clean.",
      "\"Coming into this season with a different kind of attitude and a feeling about it and we're ready to go. The vibe around the group is very energetic.

United unveiled their plans for a new ground back in March, with the club planning to demolish Old Trafford and build a brand new 100,000 capacity stadium.",
      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe hopes the project, which he has dubbed the 'Wembley of the North', will be completed by 2030 but they are struggling to buy a critical site beside the ground that is currently owned by freight company Freightliner.",
      "According to the Daily Mail, United believe the land is worth around £40million and they believe Freightliner are 'attempting to cash in with a significantly higher valuation'. As a result, United are looking into potential solutions to break the impasse.",
      "It is claimed a compulsory purchase order could be used to acquire the land, with United planning to regenerate the area surrounding the new stadium as well. The report also states that United could buy a portion of land so they can build the stadium and then acquire the rest.",
      "It is estimated the new stadium project will create up to 92,000 new jobs and more than 17,000 new homes, while it is hoped an additional 1.8 million visitors can be attracted.",
      "\"Today marks the start of an incredibly exciting journey to the delivery of what will be the world's greatest football stadium, at the centre of a regenerated Old Trafford,\" Ratcliffe said of the project.",
      "\"Our current stadium has served us brilliantly for the past 115 years, but it has fallen behind the best arenas in world sport. By building next to the existing site, we will be able to preserve the essence of Old Trafford, while creating a truly state-of-the-art stadium that transforms the fan experience only footsteps from our historic home.",

      "This summer has already been a busy one when it comes to big-money transfers. As has often been the case, the Premier League has led the way, but English clubs might not be done just yet.",
      "Since the transfer window opened, teams in England's top-flight have spent big. We've already seen one move which could end up breaking the Premier League transfer record - Florian Wirtz's move from Bayer Leverkusen to Liverpool - and that's just one of countless £50m+ deals across the country.",
      "Among those other deals are Liverpool's swoop for Hugo Ekitike, Arsenal's deal for Viktor Gyokeres and Manchester United's moves for Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo. We've also seen some notable overseas moves, with Luis Diaz and Marcus Rashford among those to leave the Premier League.",
      "Liverpool have already broken the British transfer record once and they could be about to do it again. Isak is unlikely to be available for much less than £150million, but that figure could yet come down in the coming weeks - especially if Newcastle can find a replacement.",
      "Slovenia striker Sesko is one of Newcastle's options but they're not the only ones in the mix. Manchester United also remain keen on the frontman after seeing Viktor Gyokeres opt for Arsenal, and Sesko won't come cheap.",
      "Arsenal have already been busy, adding the likes of Viktor Gyokeres, Martin Zubimendi and Noni Madueke. A move for Eze would wrap up a statement-making summer, while probably paving the way for Leandro Trossard to leave.",
      "Former Premier League star Lookman has thrived at Atalanta but feels his treatment in Bergamo has left plenty to be desired. The 27-year-old is expected to leave if a 'fair' offer arrives, having handed in a transfer request.",
      "In an emotional statement, Son confirmed he plans to leave Tottenham after a decade in North London. He appears to be Major League Soccer-bound, with LAFC ready to part with a club record £20m fee.",
      "Liverpool's summer of spending is also one with a fair few exits. Nunez looks likely to be next, with Al Hilal ready to swoop amid a lack of concrete interest from Europe.",
      "Chelsea paid Manchester United to get out of their obligation to sign Sancho after a loan, and the winger's parent club are braced for a financial hit. Juventus are ready to take a chance, though they may well need to trim their squad first.",
      "Brazil midfielder Douglas Luiz looks the most likely to leave Turin this summer. A return to the Premier League could solidify his hopes of playing at the 2026 World Cup, with Everton and Forest keen on the former Aston Villa man.",
      "England Under-21 star Elliott has long hoped to establish himself at Liverpool but now may need to move. West Ham had been linked, but Spurs could offer Champions League football and may need to recruit amid an injury concern over James Maddison.",
      "Oh, you thought we were done with Liverpool signings? They still need a centre-back after letting Jarell Quansah join Bayer Leverkusen, and England international Guehi remains the Reds' top target."

      "Rivaldo has warned Marcus Rashford he will not take Raphinha's starting spot in the Barcelona line-up this season. After yearning for a move to the La Liga giants all summer, Rashford finally got his dream switch last month, albeit on a season-long loan with a £26million option to buy.",
      "While Rashford will be remembered as one of United's great academy graduates, his tenure at Old Trafford looks all but finished while Ruben Amorim is at the helm. The 27-year-old fell out of favour under the Portuguese tactician midway through last season, subsequently being sent out on loan to Aston Villa.",
      "With it clear that he was still no part of Amorim's plans upon his return earlier this summer, Rashford then began pushing for another move away from the club, with Barcelona ultimately securing his services after missing out on Athletic Club's Nico Williams and Liverpool's Luis Diaz.",
      "While Rashford will be eager to hit the ground running in Spain, Rivaldo has warned that he will not start ahead of superstar Raphinha. Speaking to Betfair, the 53-year-old, who played for Barcelona between 1997 and 2002, said: \"I think that’s highly unlikely that Rashford will take Raphinha’s spot, especially after the season Raphinha had last year.",
      "\"In my view, Raphinha is currently among the top five players in the world. Right now, he’s an undisputed starter at Barca and already a club icon. Everyone, the players, the coaching staff, the whole club rates him very highly.",
      "\"What he did last season was outstanding, so without a doubt, that position is his. Of course, it’s always good to have top-quality players around you.",
      "\"So yes, there will be competition, but I don’t think Rashford is going to take Raphinha’s place. Other opportunities will arise, and with training, the manager will likely find a way to fit them both into the team. But for me, Raphinha is a nailed-on starter. I don’t see any chance of him being dropped from Barca’s starting line-up.\"",
      "Rivaldo also explained Rashford may have to be patient for his opportunity, and he may find himself starting off the bench as the season gets underway. He added: \"When a player leaves a club in a tough situation, like he did, and joins a team like Barcelona, it’s only natural that the coach will use training sessions and the first few matches to get a better look at him.",
      "\"Barcelona had a great season last year, so it’s normal for him to start off on the bench. I believe that little by little, he’ll find his rhythm, start to understand how the manager wants the team to play, get used to the training routines, and gradually settle in.",
      "\"Over time, he’ll earn his spot. He’s a hugely talented player – he’s already proven that in one of the toughest leagues in the world. He’s also an international. So, I fully expect him to earn a place in Barca’s starting eleven and re-establish himself as a regular in the England squad too.\"",
      "With 34 goals and 25 assists to his name across all competitions last season, Raphinha was instrumental to Barcelona clinching the La Liga title, the Copa del Rey and the Supercopa de España. And under contract until 2028, it is thought that the 28-year-old Brazilian will retain his place in Hansi Flick's starting XI in the fresh campaign.",
      "Rashford made his unofficial Barcelona debut in a pre-season friendly against Vissel Kobe last month, coming on as a substitute for Raphinha at half time. However, he lasted just 30 minutes before he was replaced by Pedro Fernandez Sarmiento.",
      "While the incident came across as somewhat embarrassing for Rashford, Flick was quick to explain that the move was to manage his fitness. After the match, he said: \"We're being very careful with Marcus because he just came from an injury and he hasn't started training completely with the ball. He's a week behind the others. He hasn't been training as much with the ball, and we want to look after him.\"",
      "Rashford returned to the fray on Thursday for Barcelona's 7-3 drubbing of FC Seoul, once again coming on for the second half as a replacement for Raphinha. However, on that occasion, he lasted the full 45 minutes, even assisting Ferran Torres' 88th-minute strike to cap off the victory.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Alan Shearer completely disagrees with Arsenal’s concerns over Manchester United target Benjamin Sesko after the Gunners decided not to pursue the striker. Arsenal finally ended their long search for a star striker last month by signing Viktor Gyokeres for around £64million.",
      "That was despite Mikel Arteta’s long-standing interest in RB Leipzig’s Sesko, having monitored his development in the Bundesliga over the past 12 months. But after holding initial talks with the German side, Arsenal bosses quickly discovered that any move for the 22-year-old would prove too costly for a player still developing his game.",
      "Three notable alarm bells were raised regarding a potential Sesko deal. They were: Leipzig’s asking price, his lofty wage demands, and doubts over his psychological readiness to spearhead Arsenal’s frontline, given his age and the fact he has not played in England previously.",
      "While Arsenal decided Sesko was too much of a gamble, Newcastle and the Red Devils have shown no such doubts in their pursuit of the Slovenian international in recent weeks. Recent reports from Slovenia hinted Sesko was edging towards a Newcastle switch but it appears he's still weighing up his options, with United yet to make a formal offer.",
      "Magpies legend Shearer’s comments back in December, long before Newcastle were linked with Sesko, indicated that the pundit held none of Arsenal’s concerns over the forward. Speaking before Leipzig's Champions League meeting with Aston Villa, Shearer backed Sesko to thrive in the Premier League.",
      "After Sesko was compared to Erling Haaland, Shearer told Amazon Prime: \"He has the same frame. He is as quick as he is. He can certainly travel with the ball like he can. He is very good at scoring goals. He is very good at bringing people into the game, so I get the comparison.",
      "\"I like him a lot. I know he is very young - he is only 21 years of age so he's got a lot of learning to do - but without doubt there is a top-class footballer in there. I think it's only a matter of time before he's playing, maybe even in the Premier League.\"",
      "When asked if he has the skill-set to make it in the Premier League, Shearer added: \"I do, I think it's a matter of who can afford him. There is no doubt that this football club has a history of making an absolute fortune on transfers and this guy could be the next one to come into the Premier League.",
      "\"Either foot - left or right - which is great to see. The work rate, the work off the ball, he's got all them things and he's got very good technique, good balance and I don't think there is a doubt in my mind that and he would look very comfortable in the Premier League. I do think he has a lot to learn, but he can learn no doubt.\"",
      "Newcastle were the first to make a move for the striker, putting forward a bid just shy of £70m, as reported by the Chronicle. That offer was swiftly turned down by Leipzig, who were hoping for a bidding war among the interested clubs.",
      "The Slovenian netted an impressive 22 goals across all competitions last season and is hailed as one of Europe's most promising talents, having been signed from Leipzig’s sister club RB Salzburg in 2023.",
      "Shearer admitted on the latest Rest is Football podcast that he does see Sesko as a 'risk' but insisted he has huge potential and would represent good business for the club if they were able to get him and Yoane Wissa in to replace Alexander Isak.",
      "\"I know Sesko is a lot younger (than Wissa) and it would be more of a gamble on him because you're going to have to pay a decent-sized fee for him,\" he said.",
      "\"I saw him two or three times in the Champions League last season and there's definitely room for improvement. Yes, there's certainly a talent there but there's a lot of improvement that can be made and you're bringing in somebody that's unknown to the Premier League and that's always going to be a bit of a risk.\"",
      "Newcastle will hope to complete a deal for Sesko if they lose their talisman Isak to Liverpool this summer, having already rejected the Premier League champions' £110m bid.",
      "Meanwhile, Ruben Amorim’s Red Devils are also in need of a No. 9 after missing out on several targets this window, with Gyokeres, Liam Delap and Hugo Ekitike opting for moves to Arsenal, Chelsea and Liverpool respectively.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Hollywood star Sydney Sweeney has been inundated with DMs from Premier League footballers following her recent split. The 27-year-old, dubbed 'the sexiest woman in the world', is now single after parting ways with her former partner, producer Jonathan Davino, earlier this year.",
      "The couple started dating in 2018 and got engaged in 2022 but have now called off the wedding. Sydney, who rose to fame with her role in the hit HBO series Euphoria, has also starred in such films as 'Anyone But You' and 'Once Upon a Time in Hollywood', and she is reportedly now enjoying the single life stateside post-breakup.",
      "However, she's also caught the attention of some of England's top footballers, who have offered to jet her off to Europe for romantic rendezvous. This comes after she snubbed Conor McGregor at a party.",
      "An insider revealed to The Sun: \"Her Instagram DMs are packed with messages from famous men trying to get in contact with her. It's mostly guys playing for teams like Manchester United, Liverpool, and Arsenal,\" reports the Daily Star.",
      "\"They offer her trips to Europe to see them and take her on a date, but she's not the kind of person who does that. Some of them are very insistent and have even tried to find her address to send her flowers, but she always refuses.",
      "\"I'd say more than 100 people, from celebs to millionaires or very rich people from the Middle East and Asia, contact her every month.\"",
      "Her friends are now reportedly teasing that she's become \"the most wanted woman in America since Madonna.\" Despite the playful tone of some admirers, Sweeney doesn't hesitate to hit back at any overzealous suitors stepping out of line.",
      "The source said: \"The ones who cross the line of respect are quickly blocked. Not long ago, an American actor who had recently divorced approached her to take her on a date.",
      "\"She declined and he started being very rude, so she told him to stop talking to her and to show some respect to her and all women.\"",
      "It was rumoured that Sydney and Jonathan's romance had been on shaky ground for a while before they called it quits.",
      "Sweeney's jam-packed filming diary is said to have played a part in the split, with her taking on both executive producer duties and the lead role in her latest project, The Housemaid.",
      "In May, she opened up about enjoying her newfound single status, saying: \"I'm learning a lot about myself, spending more time with my friends. And I'm loving it.\"",
      "Sweeney has also made waves recently after starring in a campaign for American Eagle. In the advert, she confidently posed sans bra, accompanied by the punchy tagline: \"Sydney Sweeney has great jeans\".",

      "Bruno Fernandes has called on Manchester United to make more new signings following the final match of their United States tour. The Red Devils captain called out his side's performance as 'lazy' before making a plea for more new additions.",
      "United have already added Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo to Ruben Amorim's frontline this summer, and young defender Diego Leon has also joined the Portuguese coach's squad. But after finishing 15th in the Premier League last season, the 13-times champions need to find a great deal of improvement to transform into a competitive side for 2025/26.",
      "And while Fernandes believes they have started to improve thanks to their preparations, he wants to see more competition for places in the first team. The 30-year-old wants to see one or two more signings to help United on their way.",
      "“It’s been positive [the US tour] and it’s good to create a bond with the players,\" said Fernandes. \"We looked a bit lazy today and we need to change that.",
      "“I don’t want to have a dig at anyone, but I think the club is doing the best they can in terms of all the financial situations they talk about. I don’t know about it, I’m not involved in that. But obviously it was crystal clear we needed more competition for the players that were here.",
      "“We needed more quality to get everyone to step up a bit more and to have more to do to get into the starting line-up. I think that’s what the club and the manager are trying to do and hopefully we can get one or two players more to help with that.”",
      "The RB Leipzig striker is the focus of attention from Manchester United and Newcastle and will likely cost in excess of £70million. The forward, who scored 13 goals last season, has not indicated his preference though United are said to have the advantage as they first talk to the player before making a bid to the Bundesliga side.",
      "Sesko has long been linked to United and and a new striker remains on the agenda with United willing to let Rasmus Hojlund go for £30m.",
      "Aston Villa's asking price may have put United off making a move for Ollie Watkins for the moment, but the forward has proved of interest. The Midlands club want £60m for the 29-year-old and are reluctant to sell",
      "Watkins would be in keeping with United's transfer tactics this summer: of relying on players who have been successful in Premier League already. It may require United to become more desperate to part ways with a fee that Villa deem acceptable however.",
      "There has been talk of a new goalkeeper on Manchester United's agenda this summer and few additions could be as significant as Gianluigi Donnarumma. The Paris Saint-Germain star's contract is set to expire next year with little sign of an extension.",
      "Reports have indicated the former AC Milan shotstopper would be interested in making the move, but the MEN report there is not a set budget for a new first choice currently. The Italy international could be available for free in less than 12 months.",
      "A more affordable option could be Botafogo goalkeeper John Victor. Last month, it was reported the Red Devils were ready to trigger his release clause.",
      "United have already been linked to a whole host of goalkeepers including Aston Villa 's Emi Martinez, Porto ace Diogo Costa and Cruz Azul number one Kevin Mier. Reports in Brazil claimed United were now ready to move for Victor and told the South American side they were willing to trigger the player's R$44.5 million (£6m) release clause.",
      "A move has yet to be forthcoming however.",
      "Earlier this summer it was reported Christopher Nkunku would be available for £35m if United wanted to make a move. The Frenchman has failed to shine at Chelsea after seeing his time at the club disrupted by injury.",
      "With United looking to sell Alejandro Garnacho, and Chelsea a prime candidate for his signature, there remains the chance Nkunku could be utilised in a makeweight for any deal. The Red Devils will likely prefer a full transfer fee to boost their standing in profit and sustainability rules.",

Rashford signed with the Spanish champions for the 2025/26 campaign, while the deal also includes an option to buy the 27-year-old next year for around £26million.",
      "As per Mundo Deportivo, Rashford is staying in the Hotel Sofia – the same accommodation as team-mates Wojciech Szczęsny and Roony Bardghji – as he awaits permanent housing in Barcelona.",
      "Given the luxurious atmosphere of the five-star hotel, a stone's throw from Camp Nou, the England international is likely to be comfortable staying there as long as is required.",
      "The Hotel Sofia, also known as the Grand Hyatt Barcelona, is situated in one of the city's most exclusive financial areas of Alta. With 465 rooms throughout, the hotel is full of incredible amenities that Rashford will likely use to wind down from training with the La Liga champions ahead of the season opener against RCD Mallorca.",
      "On Booking.com, the cheapest room for one night is the premium twin room, which costs £243 and includes breakfast.",
      "This basic room features two single beds, a private bathroom with a shower, flat-screen TV, seating area and city views.",
      "Rashford – whose whopping net worth was reported last year as being £64m – won't be spending his stay in one of the hotel's standard rooms, though. Barcelona will want him feeling extra comfortable, while they're also covering his entire salary this season, worth £315,000-a-week.",
      "The forward would be much more suited to the most expensive room at the Hotel Sofia, which can cost up to £1,579 per night. The junior king suite is one of the most luxurious stays at the Spanish hotel, featuring an extra-large double bed, an ensuite bathroom, minibar and even a wake-up service included in the price. It is not known, though, if Rashford is in one of those rooms.",
      "Breakfast is also included with the room, as well as free toiletries, a beautiful skyline view of the city of Barcelona and 431 square feet of space throughout.",
      "Along with the room's amenities, the hotel itself offers some incredible benefits. This includes a wellness and spa area, an outdoor area complete with a terrace and pool, and five restaurants to choose from.",
      "The spa offers the latest in relaxation techniques, including water circuits, saunas and steam baths, with expert therapists on hand to deliver some of the best treatments for hard-working stars.",
      "The hotel also has a modern gym with the best equipment, that is open 24 hours – meaning Rashford can warm up or cool down after training with some of his new team-mates.",
      "Throughout the main lobby of the hotel, spacious seating areas are dotted around with sun loungers situated around the outdoor pool, and high stools placed near the bar that is loaded with every drink imaginable.",
      "While Rashford will likely be using the hotel's amenities sparingly as he trains with Barcelona, there are certainly worse places to be resting your head in the Spanish city.",
      "Speaking about his exciting switch this summer, the 27-year-old said: \"I'm very excited. It's a club where dreams come true. They win big prizes and what the club stands for really means a lot to me.",
      "\"It feels like I'm at home and it's a big factor in my choice to come here. It's a family club and people are comfortable here. It's a good place for good players to showcase their skills.\"",

      "Amidst these rumours, it was frequently suggested RB Leipzig's Openda – who has previously been linked with United – was on the Black Cats' radar. As a fellow forward, if Sunderland had managed to secure Openda's services, it would have made the task of signing Sesko even more challenging.",
      "Leipzig would likely be reluctant to let go of both their strikers in August. However, in a positive turn of events for United and Eddie Howe's side, Openda will not be joining Sunderland. The newly promoted side are understood to not be interested in the Belgian.",

      "It's widely known that Amorim is on the hunt for a centre-forward to lead United's line. Last term, United's meagre haul of 44 Premier League goals was better only than Everton and the relegated trio of Leicester City, Ipswich Town and Southampton.",
      "On the departure front, United are keen to offload Antony, Alejandro Garnacho and Jadon Sancho, having already loaned out Marcus Rashford to Barcelona. In contrast, United's Rasmus Hojlund is determined to stay put and compete for his place in the squad.",
      "Despite some flashes of brilliance, the Danish forward's performances haven't quite lived up to expectations since his £72m move from Atalanta in the summer of 2023. Hojlund said: \"I think my plan is very clear and that's for me to stay and fight for my spot, whatever happens. Competition is fine with me, it sharpens me.",
      "\"I'm more than ready. I'm feeling sharp, so I'm welcoming everything that comes. I think it's good with competition and it only sharpens the team.",
      "\"I'm still very young. I think people forget that sometimes. I'm only 22. Obviously, not every striker is scoring 100 goals at the age of 22. But I've learned a lot, I think you can see in my game.\"",
      "United were held to a 2-2 draw with Everton on Sunday in the Premier League Summer Series across the pond in America. Amorim's men took the lead on two separate occasions courtesy of strikes from Bruno Fernandes and Mason Mount, yet the Merseysiders fought back each time through Iliman Ndiaye and an unfortunate own goal from Ayden Heaven. Their next match is at home to Fiorentina on Saturday.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Roy Keane has made his feelings incredibly clear on Ruben Amorim's new Manchester United leadership group. After a lacklustre 15th-place finish in the Premier League, the Red Devils boss, who only took the reins in November, has worked endlessly to improve the squad he inherited from Erik ten Hag this summer.",
      "For instance, United have already snapped up the likes of Matheus Cunha from Wolves and Bryan Mbeumo from Brentford to address a lack of goals last term, and they are currently pursuing RB Leipzig striker Benjamin Sesko.",
      "Meanwhile, the Portuguese tactician has also elected a number of team leaders at United with hopes of cultivating unity among the squad. The group is made up of club captain, Bruno Fernandes, and seasoned veterans Harry Maguire and Tom Heaton, as well as Diogo Dalot, Lisandro Martinez and Noussair Mazraoui.",
      "Speaking about the set-up, Amorim explained: \"We have a leadership group now. It's not just Bruno. It's not just Harry. It's six guys. They are responsible for the group. There are some things that in the last year I had to deal with and I said to them this season, you deal with that.",
      "\"Small issues are with you guys. You're responsible. All these small changes, but I think it's helping the group. We have Bruno, we have Harry, Licha [Martinez], Diogo, Tom and Nous.\"",
      "He added: \"I feel we're more organised now. We're so much better. What we eat, the way we behave on tour, on the pitch, the rules. I know they're not kids and I don't treat the players like kids. But I think these small rules can help a group to be strong. We have rules, and the rules are not to treat the players as babies.\"",
      "However, club legend Keane may take issue with the new strategy if his previous opinions on the players who are a part of it are anything to go by. For example, the 53-year-old has been a long time critic of Fernandes as club captain, questioning his leadership skills on the pitch while even going as far as calling for him to be stripped of his armband.",
      "\"Look at your right-back, where is your right-back? Where is your left-back? You are not in control. Liverpool are good enough to punish [them]. Good players will punish you.\"",
      "The former club captain has also picked problem with Martinez's lack of composure on the ball at times, despite his levels of experience. He formerly said of the centre-half: \"Fans love him to bits, but [he needs] just a little bit of composure.",
      "\"This is an experienced player. Where's that bit of composure that you need? They paid a lot of money for him to sort his feet out. That's his job – to sort his feet out quickly and expect it to come to him.\"",
      "Elsewhere, Keane has previously issued an apology to Maguire over his consistent criticism of the seasoned centre-half. Speaking on The Overlap last June, he said: \"I was harsh on Harry Maguire for footballing reasons. I've crossed the line with Maguire. I bumped into Harry a few months ago and I apologised to him.\"",
      "The only exception in the leadership set-up with regards to criticism appears to be Heaton, although this could be as the 39-year-old has had incredibly limited game time at Old Trafford over the years, appearing just three times since his arrival in 2021.",
      "It's not a one-way street with Keane and his old club, however, with the realist giving the aforementioned players credit where due. Keane did claim that Martinez is a player with \"character\" following United's 2023 Carabao Cup win over Nottingham Forest, while also paying Maguire a compliment following England's 0-0 draw with USA in 2022, although in backhanded fashion.",
      "Speaking to ITV, Keane said: \"He's done well tonight. The reason he gets stick is because he's not playing well. That's football. For some reason everyone has sympathy for Harry Maguire. But he did do well tonight, done the basics right and defended, simple as that, that's his job.\"",
      "It comes as serious reformation may be needed at Old Trafford to turn the tide at present, with United suffering their lowest-ever Premier League finish last season under Amorim's stewardship. Pre-season, however, has been increasingly positive for United this summer as they make their preparations for a fresh campaign.",
      "The Red Devils held Leeds United to a goalless draw midway through last month, before securing a 2-1 win over West Ham and a 4-1 win over Bournemouth in the Premier League Summer Series. A 2-2 draw with Everton in the same tournament was their latest result on Sunday, as they prepare to return to Old Trafford to take on Fiorentina this coming Saturday. Their Premier League opener with Arsenal then follows on Sunday, August 17 at the Theatre of Dreams.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

None of the quintet travelled to the USA for the Red Devils' pre-season tour which ended in a 2-2 draw with Everton on Sunday, as United won the Premier League Summer Series.",

      "It's added that Antony is open to taking a significant pay cut on his £4m-a-year salary to rejoin Manuel Pellegrini's men, who are set to resume talks with the Red Devils in the coming days. Betis begin their La Liga campaign in a fortnight.",
      "Amorim discussed the future of his four unwanted stars last week. \"There are players that clearly show they don't want to be here and that is normal,\" the United manager acknowledged.",

      "The Red Devils weren't at their best as they drew 2-2 with fellow tourists Everton in Atalanta, Georgia, although they did enough to win the Premier League Summer Series. But when the real stuff gets going for United against Arsenal on Sunday, August 17, Onana could still be on the sidelines, even though he feels 'great' ahead of their final pre-season friendly at home to Fiorentina on Saturday.",
      "On United's chances of a successful 2025-26 season, Onana added: \"If we have a good start against Arsenal, everything is possible.\"",
      "Speaking last week, Amorim insisted that Onana would have a better season amid simmering speculation that the Red Devils boss wants to bring in a new goalkeeper as competition for the 29-year-old. But Amorim's observations from training have poured cold water on replacement talk.",
      "\"I think even when you talk about Andre, you can see the goalkeepers,\" the United manager began. \"Even Tom is leaner, he's a different goalkeeper. Altay did really well, and Onana is going to be better, like the other guys, this year.\"",

      "Mbeumo, 25, played the opening 45 minutes of the clash in which Amorim's side put in a frustrating display. The club's newest signing arrived in a £71million deal from Brentford to join up with the squad for their pre-season tour but made his first appearance on Sunday, having previously only participated in training.",

      "Who needs to win the Europa League when you can win the Premier League Summer Series?",
      "Manchester United lifted a trophy at the Mercedes-Benz Stadium on Sunday evening after beating West Ham and Bournemouth, and drawing against Everton, during the United States tour.",
      "The 'celebrations' were obviously muted, but the vibes around United at the end of the pre-season tour are undeniably better compared to the mood in the days building up to the trip across the Atlantic.",
      "The signing of Bryan Mbeumo from Brentford for an initial £65million, announced a day before the flight to the USA, was the catalyst for a more optimistic outlook. It was important to sign Mbeumo in time to travel to the States, and there have been green shoots elsewhere in the friendlies.",
      "United have looked fitter, well-organised and capable of hurting their opponent in the final third. The players were handed individual fitness regimes during their holiday this summer and it seems to have paid off.",
      "Ruben Amorim's decision to exile players who had fallen below expectations has also seemed to pay off, with the players on the USA tour discussing the improved culture and morale in the dressing room.",
      "Amorim has banished the bad eggs. There is a feeling of harmony within the group and the players have seemed notably upbeat during sessions at the Endeavor Health Performance Centre.",
      "The performances themselves have been better. United cruised to victories against West Ham and Bournemouth, although the draw against Everton in the final game was a reminder that there is further work to do.",
      "For all the positivity on tour, some of the old problems remain, particularly in midfield, which is an area that Amorim needs to strengthen before the end of the summer transfer window.",
      "United struggled with Everton's physicality in midfield and will struggle throughout the campaign if a fresh face is not added. Amorim also needs to sign a striker, potentially Benjamin Sesko from RB Leipzig.",
      "Speaking during half-time against Everton, Berrada spoke about transfers and promised that club officials are working long hours to ensure Amorim's squad receives additional reinforcements.",
      "“We have to do a lot of multitasking,\" he said. \"We have a team back home led by Jason, the recruitment team, that is working around the clock to ensure that we continue to find opportunities to strengthen our squad. There are lots of late calls and early morning meetings to make sure that we stay on top of it.”",
      "Berrada continued: “The mood has been very good. The culture, the standards, the values, we are trying to ensure that we create a team spirit that allows the players to compete at the highest level.",
      "\"We have very high standards, Ruben is very clear about that and so is Jason [Wilcox]. It is something we want to see with the players, with the staff, with everyone, because what we want to do is to win and to start winning titles as soon as possible.",
      "“Of course, adding players helps. We have seen the arrival of Bryan Mbeumo, Matheus Cunha and Diego Leon. They have adapted really well.",
      "\"We are going to see Bryan play for the first time, Matheus has already shown his quality and Diego has shown that he is adapting very quickly, having just come from Paraguay, so all of the signs are positive and we are cautiously optimistic. We hope we are going to have a great season.”",
      "Berrada also said the right things during another brief interview to MUTV on the money-spinning post-season trip to Malaysia and Hong Kong in May.",
      "Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha should prove to be tremendous signings, but more high-quality additions are required to get United into a position to challenge for European football.",
      "Amorim said United \"need to return to Europe\" during his captivating chat with journalists on tour. United need to sign a midfielder and a striker to have a chance of achieving that goal this season.",
      "The mood has improved at Old Trafford, but there is still work to do before deadline day.",
      "The countdown is on to the 2025/26 Premier League campaign - and our pre-season guide is the ideal way to prepare for the action ahead.",
      "As well as in-depth analysis and opinion on your club, we turn the spotlight on every team battling for top-flight glory - or simply survival in the toughest league in the world!",
      "Also full fixtures guide so you don't miss a game in what is set to be a thrilling season.",

      "Suddenly, there are just four weeks to go until the summer transfer window closes.",
      "Manchester United have had a successful summer so far, bringing in three new signings, including two statement additions in Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo.",
      "After missing out on European qualification for the new campaign, many feared United would struggle to attract big-name stars to contribute to head coach Ruben Amorim's rebuild.",
      "However, United have successfully added two of the Premier League's best players from last season to their ranks, and they are not done yet.",
      "Fresh from spending north of £120million on Cunha and Mbeumo, who scored 37 goals between them last season for Wolves and Brentford respectively, United are now hoping to win the race to sign Benjamin Sesko from RB Leipzig.",
      "The Reds are desperate to sign a striker ahead of the September 1 deadline and Sesko, 22, sits top of their wish list. Signing a striker has been their leading priority all summer.",
      "With that in mind, MEN Sport has taken a close look at what United should be striving to try and achieve ahead of the window closing in a month's time to complete a dream window.",
      "United are determined to win the race for Slovenia international Sesko. The Leipzig ace, who scored 21 goals last season, is also the subject of interest from Newcastle United, who have already seen an opening bid turned down.",
      "United have finished each of the last two Premier League campaigns with a negative goal difference and believe the addition of a new goalscorer will help them avoid falling into the same trap for the third season running.",
      "Although he is unproven in the Premier League, he has a respectable record in Germany for Leipzig. Furthermore, he has a very high ceiling and plenty of potential.",
      "In addition to wanting to try and sign Sesko, United also remain in the market for a goalkeeper and a midfielder. Although sales remain important to boosting the club's finances, United believe they can fund the addition of Sesko without having to rely on sales first.",
      "However, outgoings are likely to still be required if United are to bring in a 'keeper and a midfielder. They need a shot-stopper who can challenge and compete with Andre Onana for the No.1 spot and a midfielder who can slot straight into the starting XI.",
      "United have overseen a collection of loan outgoings so far this summer, with Marcus Rashford, who joined Barcelona last month, the headline departure. However, they are yet to oversee a permanent sale.",
      "Following Rashford's season-long loan switch to Barcelona, four members of the 'bomb squad' still need moving on, with Tyrell Malacia, Alejandro Garnacho, Jadon Sancho and Antony all waiting in the departure lounge.",
      "United would love to sell the quartet permanently but they are yet to have received an offer for any of them. Antony continues to be linked with the prospect of departing on loan.",
      "Garnacho is the biggest asset United want to sell before the end of the window and Chelsea are keen. The Reds should be targeting a minimum of £50m for his services.",
      "United should also be striving to sell Altay Bayindir and Joshua Zirkzee before the bell. Despite being open to selling Rasmus Hojlund for £30m, it would make more sense to cash-in on Zirkzee.",
      "The Dutchman demonstrated last season he is not a No.9 and is more useful as a No.10. United have bolstered their options in that position this summer and it is hard to imagine Zirkzee getting regular game time, whereas Hojlund could still have a role to play.",
      "Elsewhere, United should try and ensure youngsters Harry Amass and Toby Collyer leave on loan. The former has not featured in pre-season amid the expectation he will depart on a temporary deal.",
      "Collyer, too, is expected to leave on loan. He is understood to be determined to fight for his place in Amorim's plans, but sources say he \"has to go on loan\" for the benefit of his development.",

      "Sancho's relationship with Erik ten Hag broke down in September 2023 and he returned on loan to Signal Iduna Park for a second stint with Dortmund during the second half of that season.",
      "The winger signed for Chelsea on a season-long loan in 2024/2025, but the London club made an unprecedented decision to break their obligation to sign Sancho permanently after falling to agree on wages.",
      "Chelsea paid a £5million penalty charge to United to break the agreement and Sancho has trained alone at Carrington this summer while his representative explores options in the window.",
      "Sancho has been linked with Juventus and Fenerbahce, but has still not found a new club in August.",
      "However, Dortmund's sporting director, Sebastian Kehl, was more forthcoming: “[Jadon] is constantly being linked with us. I understand the desire. We’re thinking about it within our possibilities. The conditions have to be right. We will definitely do something, but we’re limited.”",
      "Dortmund chiefs publicly said they were delighted with Sancho during his six-month loan spell in Germany, but they did not bid for Sancho to sign him permanently again last summer.",
      "Chelsea subsequently deemed Sancho's contribution of five goals and 10 assists during his time at Stamford Bridge last season as not good enough for the wages he wanted during talks.",
      "Sancho was regarded as one of Europe's most exciting players when he arrived in Manchester for £72.9million, but his time at Old Trafford has been disappointing.",

      "United postponed Rashford's return to Carrington for pre-season training last month and removed him from his iconic No. 10 shirt. However, he has now secured his dream move to Barcelona after spending the latter part of the 2024/25 season on loan at Aston Villa.",

As Rashford performed a muted celebration, a fan in the crowd wearing a Barca scarf, held aloft a United shirt with the player's name and number on the back.",

Despite not being at their sharpest, United managed a 2-2 draw with Everton in Atlanta, Georgia, securing the Premier League Summer Series title.",

      "There had been some suggestions that Jadon Sancho could be given yet another chance at Manchester United when he failed to complete negotiations with Chelsea.",
      "Enzo Maresca's inability to reach a compromise on wages with Sancho cost his club £5m in penalty fees but it could yet cost United even more. There is a general understanding that the Reds are needing to sell players in order to buy further reinforcements for the new season.",
      "Benjamin Sesko is the clear priority and it seems that United should discover this week if the Slovenian wishes to join them or Newcastle in the summer transfer window. Even if he were to choose the Magpies, United would likely shift their focus to another forward so the ability to sell the likes of Sancho is crucial.",
      "Unfortunately for United, they have been unable to find a club that is willing to splash the £20m, at least, which would convince the Reds to sell and avoid them damaging their Profit and Sustainability Rules (PSR) position. However, on Monday it appears United's fail safe Sancho option has shown their hand.",
      "Speaking to Sky Sport Deutschland, Dortmund's sporting director Sebastian Kehl revealed that Sancho was a player they are pondering a move for in the summer transfer window. \"[Jadon] is constantly being linked with us,\" he explained.",
      "\"I understand the desire. We’re thinking about it within our possibilities.",
      "\"The conditions have to be right. We will definitely do something, but we’re limited.\"",
      "While their interest in Sancho will be welcomed by United, their words perhaps symbolise the harsh reality of the situation for the Reds. Kehl's comments suggest that a bid which is enough to persuade the club to sell is unlikely to be forthcoming.",
      "Instead, it appears Dortmund will try to sign Sancho on loan, perhaps with another obligation to pay a reduced rate in 2026 when the 25-year-old will be out of contract. That figure would ultimately be a smidge of the fee United are currently demanding but their negotiating position will be weak considering that the winger can walk away for nothing at the end of the forthcoming season.",
      "At the moment, if United are to get Sancho off their books, this appears to be the only option available to them. The harsh reality is, unless a club tries to gazump their rivals in the market, this is the only way of getting the winger to a new club.",

With a striker seemingly next up, Benjamin Sesko, who is also eyed by Newcastle, tops the priority list for the Red Devils.",
      "However, Nicholas, with over 175 appearances for Arsenal under his belt, has condemned United's recruitment strategy, questioning why they didn't consider options like Ramsdale.",
      "\"There are a lot of players out there, a whole list who I think would be better than what Manchester United currently have,\" Nicholas told Sky Bet. \"I just don't know where they see themselves going.\"",
      "Nicholas highlighted two players who have made moves this summer at reasonable prices: Norgaard, who joined Arsenal in July for £12m, and Ramsdale, who moved to Newcastle on loan from Southampton last week, reports the Mirror.",
      "\"If I was Manchester United, why didn't they go in for Christian Norgaard? It looks as if they've waited for two high-profile players,\" Nicholas remarked.",
      "\"But I look at them and I think, why are not adding more players like Norgaard, or players who have played well at Bournemouth and Newcastle, you could disrupt things and see who's interested.",
      "\"There are so many pillars I just can't understand, the whole lack of authority defensively and what is the current situation with the goalkeeper?",
      "\"Why don't they go and get Aaron Ramsdale? He's qualified, he knows the circuit, he's English, experienced, and competitive. I know Ramsdale hasn't won too much, but it's not far off what United have won.",
      "\"I just don't see how they see what an upgrade means. I don't see Manchester United fans showing one bit of excitement as it stands right now, and it's getting close for them to get aggressive towards the club again.\"",
      "Bringing in a fresh face between the sticks seems to be on the Old Trafford agenda this summer following Andre Onana's disappointing performances last season.",
      "Aston Villa's No. 1 Emi Martinez appears set to depart Villa Park, though a United loan bid for the Argentine was supposedly turned down last month, and it is thought interest has dwindled.",
      "Manager Amorim was questioned about the possibility of recruiting a new shot-stopper before the transfer deadline, and refused to dismiss the idea.",
      "\"To hope is a strong word,\" Amorim replied when questioned about his aspirations to recruit a new goalkeeper or forward. \"We are always looking to improve the team. And we have some characteristics that we would like to have. But again, it depends on the market. It depends on the sales. We'll see.\"",

      "Even without a new No.9, United have rallied eight goals across three games. They have avoided casualties in defence, a department usually hit by injury crises, but their midfield is thin.",
      "In this squad with a surfeit of No.10s, another popped up with a goal. Mason Mount's goal evoked memories of his tie-killing strike against Athletic Bilbao in May. That goal and cameo effectively earned Mount a promotion to the starting XI for the Europa League final. He is now even more up against it to regain a starting status.",
      "A commentator familiar to American soccer audiences announced the line-ups as if it were a wrestling event. In case anybody could not hear him, the 360-degree giant screen listed Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha in the same United line-up together for the first time.",
      "United's warm-ups consist of defence-versus-attack drills and their set-up in the magnificent Mercedes-Benz Stadium confirmed Cunha would be the centre forward. He was the only one not to hit his cue in the fifth minute when played in by Amad.",
      "The most striking sequence in the move were Mbeumo's two touches - his first two in a United shirt. It advanced the attack and enabled Bruno Fernandes to accelerate it. Mbeumo's prompt play drew 'ooh's from a starstruck crowd. Then he generated a round of applause following a canny dribble out of defence in the 33rd minute.",
      "Mbeumo was on the right of the two playmakers but popped up on the left wing. His first time through-ball for Amad to win United's penalty was exemplary.",
      "That opening was fashioned by Cunha, Fernandes and Mbeumo all combining from deep. Mbeumo's awareness of teammates' positioning was so natural that it belied the fact that this was his first appearance for United. The trio clicked quickly.",
      "Amorim never entertained the prospect of playing a strikerless system in the final weeks of last season when it was worth trialling amid Hojlund's impotence. He has had a change of heart following £133.5million worth of investment in the attack.",
      "Amad, a winger-cum-playmaker, is one of three players to have started all three tour matches. As starry as Cunha, Mbeumo and Fernandes are, the signing driven by John Murtough remains one of the most integral in Amorim's side. Amad has played wide right and as one of the two 10s and is emerging as a hidden asset with his lung-bursting sprints on the defender's blindside.",

It is in his and United's interests that he does not remain there for most of the competitive season, though he is possibly more suitable than a Slovenian playing for the seventh-placed side in the Bundesliga. Cunha still rallied to press and embark into a rousing sprint.",
      "The incumbent striker, Rasmus Hojlund, feels he is being forced out at United and emerged to vent again. Hojlund kicked the post after Patrick Dorgu kicked the ball at goal rather than across the goal.",
      "United still have issues further back. Manuel Ugarte went from domineering against West Ham to dominated by Everton. He erred for Iliman Ndiyaye's equaliser by attempting to dribble the ball out of United's third.",
      "Everton sensed Ugarte's vulnerability and they were quicker to press him in the second half. Ugarte pleaded with the referee for extra protection, which merely fuelled Everton whenever he next had the ball. He attempted to match them and fouled Ndiyaye overzealously.",
      "Ugarte, Kobbie Mainoo, Casemiro and Toby Collyer is not a midfield quartet that is going to cut it over the course of a season. Even without European football. United intend to loan out Collyer and Casemiro has been omitted from the new six-man leadership group, having been a member of the eight-man team under Erik ten Hag.",
      "Mainoo was replaced by Mount and Fernandes dropped back into midfield. That worked a treat when Fernandes shifted the ball inside for Mount to leather the ball past Jordan Pickford.",
      "You could play Fernandes in goal instead of the errant Altay Bayindir and he would still be the most influential player in the United shirt. He is papering over the cracks in midfield now, though he erred for both of Everton's equalisers. Fernandes was squaring up to Ndiyaye, having kicked out at him, when Amad's attempted clearance deflected in off the luckless Ayden Heaven.",

      "The Parisians look set to be preparing for life without their current No.1 with Lille's Lucas Chevalier due to sign this week. As for United, it is thought that they would like to sign a new goalkeeper but MEN Sport understands that there is not a set budget for a new first choice.",
      "Plus, it is believed that Andre Onana has received reassurances that he is part of the plans at Old Trafford this season despite missing matches on the tour of the US through injury. Nevertheless, TEAMtalk understands Donnarumma would be keen on moving to United despite the club not qualifying for this season's Champions League.",
      "However, the route to bringing the Italian to United is not straightforward. While Onana leaving is deemed unlikely, it is claimed in this report that there is a chance he could be sold should a club become interested in his services.",
      "Until that point, it is claimed that United would be unlikely to purchase the 26-year-old on a permanent basis. Instead, the Reds would be more open to the idea of a loan switch but this currently does not interest PSG.",
      "A compromise could see United loan Donnarumma with an obligation to buy him for a reduced fee next summer. But, PSG will likely see this as a last resort towards the end of the transfer window.",

      "Manchester United chief executive Omar Berrada is \"cautiously optimistic\" ahead of the forthcoming season, reaffirming his hunger to help restock the club's trophy cabinet as soon as possible.",
      "United will be hoping to make amends for a forgettable 2024/25 campaign, which saw them finish 15th in the Premier League.",
      "In a bid to try and correct last season's wrongs, United have spent north of £130million in the transfer market so far, bringing in Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo - who made his first appearance for the club in Sunday night's 2-2 draw with Everton in the United States - and Diego Leon.",
      "Although Berrada has acknowledged new additions will strengthen United's chances of making progress in 2025/26, he has also hailed the improvement in the mood around the club, praising the work that has been done by the likes of head coach Ruben Amorim and football director Jason Wilcox.",
      "Berrada, speaking ahead of the draw with Everton, told MUTV: \"The mood has been very good. The culture, the standards, the values, we are trying to ensure that we create a team spirit that allows the players to compete at the highest level.",
      "\"We have very high standards, Ruben is very clear about that and so is Jason. It is something we want to see with the players, with the staff, with everyone, because what we want to do is to win and to start winning titles as soon as possible.",
      "\"Of course, adding players helps. We have seen the arrival of Bryan Mbeumo, Matheus Cunha and Diego Leon. They have adapted really well.",
      "\"We are going to see Bryan play for the first time, Matheus has already shown his quality and Diego has shown that he is adapting very quickly, having just come from Paraguay, so all of the signs are positive and we are cautiously optimistic. We hope we are going to have a great season.\"",
      "On United's plans to continue strengthening the squad ahead of the transfer window closing on September 1, Berrada added: \"We have to do a lot of multitasking.",
      "\"We have a team back home led by Jason, the recruitment team, that is working around the clock to ensure that we continue to find opportunities to strengthen our squad. There are lots of late calls and early morning meetings to make sure that we stay on top of it.\"",
      "The countdown is on to the 2025/26 Premier League campaign - and our pre-season guide is the ideal way to prepare for the action ahead.",

      "Roy Keane has already shared his views regarding the players in Ruben Amorim's new Manchester United leadership structure.",
      "Following a disappointing 15th-place campaign in the Premier League, the Red Devils head coach, who assumed control only in November last year, has worked tirelessly this summer to enhance the squad he took over from Erik ten Hag.",
      "United have already secured signings such as Matheus Cunha from Wolves and Bryan Mbeumo from Brentford to tackle their goalscoring woes from last season, whilst they continue to chase RB Leipzig forward Benjamin Sesko.",
      "Additionally, the Portuguese coach has appointed several team leaders at United in a bid to foster greater harmony within the group. The leadership collective comprises club skipper Bruno Fernandes as well as experienced players like Harry Maguire and Tom Heaton, alongside Diogo Dalot, Lisandro Martinez and Noussair Mazraoui, reports the Mirror.",
      "Discussing the arrangement, Amorim said: \"We have a leadership group now. It's not just Bruno. It's not just Harry. It's six guys. They are responsible for the group. There are some things that in the last year I had to deal with and I said to them this season, you deal with that.",
      "\"Small issues are with you guys. You're responsible. All these small changes, but I think it's helping the group. We have Bruno, we have Harry, Licha [Martinez], Diogo, Tom and Nous.\"",
      "He added: \"I feel we're more organised now. We're so much better. What we eat, the way we behave on tour, on the pitch, the rules. I know they're not kids and I don't treat the players like kids. But I think these small rules can help a group to be strong. We have rules, and the rules are not to treat the players as babies.\"",
      "Nevertheless, Old Trafford icon Keane might well disagree with the fresh approach if his past comments about the players involved are any indication. The 53-year-old has consistently criticised Fernandes' credentials as skipper, raising doubts about his leadership qualities on the field and even suggesting he should lose the armband.",
      "\"Look at your right-back, where is your right-back? Where is your left-back? You are not in control. Liverpool are good enough to punish [them]. Good players will punish you.\"",
      "The former club captain has also taken issue with Martinez's occasional lack of composure on the ball, despite his wealth of experience. He previously said of the centre-back: \"Fans love him to bits, but [he needs] just a little bit of composure.",
      "\"This is an experienced player. Where's that bit of composure that you need? They paid a lot of money for him to sort his feet out. That's his job – to sort his feet out quickly and expect it to come to him.\"",
      "Meanwhile, Keane has previously offered an apology to Maguire regarding his relentless criticism of the experienced centre-back. Speaking on The Overlap last June, he said: \"I was harsh on Harry Maguire for footballing reasons. I've crossed the line with Maguire. I bumped into Harry a few months ago and I apologised to him.\"",
      "The exception in the leadership group when it comes to criticism appears to be Heaton, though this may be because the 39-year-old has enjoyed remarkably limited playing time at Old Trafford throughout the years, featuring just three times since his arrival in 2021.",
      "It's not entirely one-sided with Keane and his former club, though, with the pundit offering the mentioned players praise when warranted.",
      "Keane did suggest that Martinez is a player with \"character\" following United's 2023 Carabao Cup victory over Nottingham Forest, whilst also complimenting Maguire after England's 0-0 stalemate with USA in 2022, albeit in typically blunt fashion.",
      "Speaking on ITV, Keane said: \"He's done well tonight. The reason he gets stick is because he's not playing well. That's football. For some reason everyone has sympathy for Harry Maguire. But he did do well tonight, done the basics right and defended, simple as that, that's his job.\"",
      "It comes at a time when significant changes may be required at Old Trafford to reverse the current situation, with United experiencing their worst-ever Premier League finish last season under Amorim's management. However, pre-season has been increasingly optimistic for United this summer as they gear up for a new campaign.",
      "Last month, the Red Devils held Leeds United to a goalless draw, before clinching a 2-1 victory over West Ham and a 4-1 triumph over Bournemouth in the Premier League Summer Series. Their most recent result was a 2-2 draw with Everton in the same tournament on Sunday, as they get ready to return to Old Trafford to face Fiorentina this coming Saturday. Their Premier League opener against Arsenal then takes place on Sunday, August 17 at the Theatre of Dreams.",

While those rumours were ongoing, there were frequent reports saying the RB Leipzig star's colleague, Openda - who has also been linked with United in the past - was of interest to Sunderland.",
      "The Belgian is also a forward so if the Black Cats did manage to sign him, it would have made the task of signing Sesko even more difficult, as the Bundesliga side would surely not be willing to part with both centre-forwards this summer. However, in what is good news for United, Openda will not be joining the Black Cats.",
      "Newcastle were the first side to bid for the striker, tabling a bid worth just under £70m, according to the Chronicle. This was quickly rejected by Leipzig, who are holding out for a bidding war between interested parties.",
      "The Slovenian contributed 22 goals in all competitions last season and is widely considered to be one of the best young players on the continent. Reports from Slovenia recently claimed Sesko was leaning towards a move to Newcastle, but he is now understood to be considering his options.",
      "United have already seen targets such as Viktor Gyokeres, Liam Delap and Hugo Ekitike opt to join Arsenal, Chelsea and Liverpool respectively. Ruben Amorim has managed to add to his frontline with Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo arriving this summer.",
      "However, it's no secret the Portuguese manager wants to add a new out-and-out centre-forward to his frontline. Last season, United only scored 44 goals in the Premier League, with only Everton and relegated Leicester City, Ipswich Town and Southampton recording worse tallies in front of goal.",
      "United are also still looking to offload Antony, Alejandro Garnacho and Jadon Sancho, having recently sent Marcus Rashford on loan to Barcelona. Meanwhile, United striker Rasmus Hojlund has said he wants to remain at the club and fight for his place.",
      "While there have been some impressive moments for the Dane, his form has so far left plenty to be desired, since he arrived from Atalanta for £72m in the summer of 2023. Hojlund said: \"I think my plan is very clear and that's for me to stay and fight for my spot, whatever happens. Competition is fine with me, it sharpens me.",
      "\"I'm more than ready. I'm feeling sharp, so I'm welcoming everything that comes. I think it's good with competition and it only sharpens the team.",

      "United recently drew 2-2 with Everton in the Premier League Summer Series in the USA. Amorim's side led twice through goals from Bruno Fernandes and Mason Mount, but the Toffees equalised on both occasions, with Iliman Ndiaye and an own goal from Ayden Heaven.",

      "Each day we’re ranking the top 20 rumours involving Premier League clubs, the higher the link, the more likely we feel they are to become done deals.",
      "So we start with the tittle-tattle…",
      "",
      "20) 🆕 Rasmus Hojlund – Manchester United to RB Leipzig\nThere have been murmurs of a swap deal involving Hojlund and Sesko, but the former really doesn’t want to leave United. The Premier League club signing Sesko seems contingent on player sales, whether it’s before they bid or after, so sending Hojlund to Germany works well for them. It’s all too good to be true, unfortunately.",
      "",
      "19) Alejandro Garnacho – Manchester United to Aston Villa \nUnited are said to have spoken to Chelsea and Villa in an effort to lump Garnacho in as part of a deal to sign a striker. Chelsea’s valuations of Garnacho and Nicolas Jackson are miles apart, but there could be some common ground with Villa. For the purposes of PSR, they would need to be separate transactions, but Villa are in a stronger position than United given they know Garnacho has got to go somewhere before the deadline, whereas they would be quite content to keep Watkins. Regardless, there is a deal to be done here.",

      "",
      "18) 🆕 Jeremy Jacquet – Rennes to Arsenal\nAnother defender, Mikel? That’s insane. Arsenal’s interest in Jacquet will only be accelarated should Oleksandr Zinchenko or Jakub Kiwior leave. The latter is attracting interest from all over Europe, but Arteta wants to keep him. Arsenal even rejected an offer from Portugal earlier this summer for the Pole, who’s destined for a place on this rumour ranking very, very soon.",
      "",
      "17) Gianluigi Donnarumma – PSG to Manchester United\nDonnarumma has been in a contract dispute with PSG but we’re starting to think there might be more to this than his representatives using United’s name and the oldest trick in the agent’s book. PSG are signing Lucas Chevalier from Lille and appear more likely to sell Donnarumma now than allow him to leave for nothing next year. United certainly need a goalkeeper, but they also need a striker and neither can be paid for with brass buttons. Still, one to watch…",
      "",
      "16) 🆕 Arnaud Kalimuendo – Rennes to Brentford\nAfter scoring 17 goals in 33 Ligue 1 games last season, Kalimuendo is a wanted man. AC Milan are keen but Brentford have reportedly ‘made contact’. This link shows a willingness to sell Yoane Wissa, which is great news for Newcastle.",
      "",
      "15) 🔽 Darwin Nunez – Liverpool to AC Milan\nGianluca Di Marzio says Nunez is Milan’s ‘first choice’, with Rasmus Hojlund, Dusan Vlahovic and Kalimuendo the back-up options. It’s down to Italy or the Middle East for Captain Chaos…",
      "",
      "14) James McAtee – Manchester City to Nottingham Forest \nForest are said to have had a bid rejected for the England Under-21 star, whose minutes at City are threatened by Rayan Cherki’s arrival. McAtee has interest from Eintracht Frankfurt and Borussia Dortmund, while Palace are keen too. But Forest aren’t far off with their £25million bid. We suspect this will come down to the player’s preference: stay in the Premier League, or a gap season or two in Europe?",
      "",
      "13) Dominic Calvert-Lewin – Everton to Aston Villa\nCalvert-Lewin left Everton at the end of last season and Villa reportedly see the ex-England striker as a cheap way to bolster their attacking options. Newcastle and AC Milan are thinking along similar lines but Villa currently appear to be favourites.",
      "",
      "12) 🆕 Tyrique George – Chelsea to RB Leipzig\nChelsea’s ridiculous urge to sign all the players means promising talents like George are left behind, and left with no choice but to seek pastures new. Romano says Leipzig have asked about George in negotiations to send Xavi Simons to Stamford Bridge, and they’re not the only Bundesliga team interested in signing the young winger.",
      "",
      "11) Ollie Watkins – Aston Villa to Manchester United\nThis one picked up again after reports that United are to choose between Watkins and Benjamin Sesko. Of course, we’d expect Villa might want a say in that. And, if asked, they’d say they want £60million. United, apparently, reckon they can get Villa down to around £45million. But they thought they could haggle with Brentford and ended up paying more for Bryan Mbeumo. Watkins might find himself as United’s preferred option just because they could offer Garnacho to Villa.",

      "10) 🔼 Alejandro Garnacho – Manchester United to Chelsea\nThere are no negotiations between United and Chelsea but Romano says the winger is giving his ‘full priority’ to the Club World Cup winners. The Blues have already signed Jamie Gittens this summer and are working on a deal for Xavi Simons. It doesn’t feel like they need Garnacho, but they’ve not required half the players they’ve signed in the Clearlake era. Poor Tyrique George knows he doesn’t stand a chance and has asked to leave. This club, man…",
      "",
      "9) Benjamin Sesko – RB Leipzig to Manchester United\nOn Wednesday morning, we were told that Watkins was the priority; by Wednesday evening, it’s Sesko. As always, it seems United are fighting themselves, with some lobbying for Watkins, while head of recruitment Christopher Vivell is pushing for the player he’s credited with signing for RB Leipzig six years ago. Has anyone asked Ruben Amorim? Either way, players are “scared” to join Newcastle and not a team that just finished 15th in the Premier League. United’s boost is Newcastle’s blow. Until it isn’t. United are now behind their league rivals in the race for Sesko.",

      "8) Jadon Sancho – Manchester United to Juventus\nIt was reported ages ago that agreements had been reached between the clubs and the player, but still we wait. The reason, we suspect, is Juve stalling for time. They do need to sell, but they also know there is no other market for Sancho, If they sit tight, United will grow more desperate, as might the player, and better terms will almost certainly become available. Indeed, United’s price has come down again to between £15million and £17million (so, £16million?) and Sancho’s agent was in Turin recently in a vain attempt to speed things along.",
      "",
      "7) Yoane Wissa – Brentford to Newcastle\nNewcastle are having a ‘mare of a summer, but some rare good news came in the form of Wissa’s desire to move to St James’ Park. However, and quite reasonably, we’ll add, Brentford are intent on keeping the forward having already lost their manager, captain and best player this summer. If Newcastle really want Wissa, they’ll have to pay over £40m for a player who was reportedly told last summer that he could leave for £26m at the end of 2024/25, prompting him to go on strike. With Brentford due back in London from their pre-season camp, we can expect some clarity here soon. The Bees have shown they are no pushover but Wissa isn’t f***ing around either.",
      "",
      "6) Alexander Isak – Newcastle to Liverpool\nLiverpool’s first bid for Isak was made on Friday and very swiftly rejected by Newcastle. It was so emphatically rejected, in fact, that the champions reportedly won’t make a second bid. That leaves Isak in a very sticky situation, having burned plenty of bridges in the north east. The deal is dropping down our power ranking, but we’re refusing to rule it out completely…",

      "5) Eberechi Eze – Crystal Palace to Arsenal\nViktor Gyokeres is signed, sealed and delivered and the feeling during that saga was that Eze would be the Gunners’ next target. The England star has, apparently, been telling his mates he’s moving to the Emirates, but Arsenal now need to deliver on Palace’s clear demand for his £68million buy-out clause to be met. Cue Andrea Berta haggling for weeks over the number of instalments. And the Gunners need to sell first.",
      "",
      "4) 🔼 Benjamin Sesko – RB Leipzig to Newcastle\nNewcastle’s interest in Sesko goes back a year and some reports suggest personal terms are already sorted. But Man Utd’s interest complicates matters but a Magpies bid is in. Let’s see whether or not Leipzig reject it and if the Red Devils react…",
      "",
      "3) 🔼 Darwin Nunez – Liverpool to Al-Hilal\nLiverpool rejected an offer of around £70m from Al-Hilal for Nunez in January and will not delude themselves into thinking a summer sale could generate nearly as much. But another piece in their Isak puzzle could fall into place thanks to the Magpies’ owners. PIF want to give the Saudi Pro League runners-up a shiny new centre-forward and Nunez has been earmarked as that man, with the Uruguayan described as ‘receptive’ to that interest ahead of bidding.",
      "",
      "2) Xavi Simons – RB Leipzig to Chelsea\nA Chelsea move appeals to Simons and the Blues are keen to make it happen. But first they need to raise some cash and even then, they will look for a hefty discount on the £56million RB Leipzig are demanding for the Arsenal target.",

      "Newcastle legend Alan Shearer thinks Man Utd and the Magpies would be taking “a gamble” by signing RB Leipzig striker Benjamin Sesko this summer.",
      "The Geordies have made a €80m bid for Sesko, reaching the German side’s valuation, but it was turned down by Leipzig over the structure of a deal.",
      "Reports claim that Man Utd are set to ‘match’ Newcastle‘s offer for the Slovenia international with the Red Devils waiting on the green light from the player.",
      "Both the Red Devils and the Magpies have missed out on other targets so far this summer and it will be a tough blow to take for whichever club loses out on Sesko.",
      "But former Newcastle striker Shearer insists that a transfer for Sesko is “a gamble” for Man Utd or Newcastle as he is young and unproven in the Premier League.",
      "Shearer said on The Rest Is Football podcast: “With Sesko, I know he’s young, but that would be a gamble because you’re going to have to pay a decent sized fee.",
      "“I saw him two or three times in the Champions League last season and there’s definitely room for improvement.",
      "“Yes, there’s certainly a talent there but there’s a lot improvement that can be made as well. You’re bringing someone who’s unknown into the Premier League and that’s always a bit of a risk.”",
      "On Newcastle’s transfer window so far, Shearer added: “Up to now it’s been a disastrous window for Newcastle. It was meant to be the time we kicked on with heavy investment and hopefully go to another level. It’s been anything but that to be honest.",
      "“They’ve missed out on several first-choice targets, so up to now it’s been really poor. Their transfer window has been a mess.",
      "READ: Seven banished players who have been stripped of their shirt number this summer – including three No. 10s",
      "“I thought Isak might have stayed for another season and then this would have happened next summer. But it is what it is.",
      "“If he can’t be persuaded to stay then you take the money and you just say, “thanks for the great memories, off you go.”",
      "German football expert Rune Gjerulff has identified the areas of Sesko’s game that he will need to improve to adapt to the Premier League.",
      "Gjerulff told Bulinews: “It was quite a tough season for Leipzig, which forced them to change coach after a disappointing Champions League campaign. They’ve been struggling, which reflects on his output, but he was still one of their best and most consistent players.",
      "“Sesko’s strengths are certainly his physicality and speed – he’s great at making dangerous runs in behind defences, but he’s also a very clinical and instinctive finisher, especially when the ball drops to him in the area. His work rate is good and he’s a willing runner off the ball as well.",
      "“His hold-up play is quite strong, but I think his link-up play is a side of his game that he can still improve. It’s not that he’s bad at that side of the game, but compared to someone like Kai Havertz, he’s not at that level. In particular, his passing will need to get a lot better.",
      "“But during his young career, he’s shown he can take those steps forward. His mentality is definitely a strength – he’s a player who wants to learn and wants to improve so in that sense he will be a quick learner.”",
      "Newcastle legend Alan Shearer has slammed the Magpies for a “ridiculous” lie which kicked off the Alexander Isak saga, as the striker wants to leave the club.",

      "",
      "10) Juventus – £102.54m\nAfter sneaking into the Champions League, there was money to spend. Jonathan David on a free transfer might be the coup of the summer but the biggest money has been spent on Francisco Conceicao from Porto.",
      "",
      "9) Tottenham – £120.52m\nSpent a decent whack of money spent on Kevin Danso, Mathys Tel, Luka Vuskovic and Kota Takai before Thomas Frank even got a say. Mohammed Kudus had shot Spurs up into the top three before they were overtaken again; Morgan Gibbs-White would send them scurrying back up the list if they can ever get that deal done.",
      "CHECK OUT: The F365 transfer rumour power ranking",
      "",
      "8) Sunderland – £122.53m\nEight first-team signings have come in. We’re not sure they’re finished, either.",
      "",
      "7) Atletico Madrid – £133.6m\nAlex Baena, Johnny Cardoso, Thiago Almada, Matteo Ruggeri and Marc Pubill have all cost a pretty penny and are aged between 22 and 24 as Diego Simeone rebuilds again. David Hancko completes the spending…for now.",
      "",
      "6) Manchester United – £134.8m\nThe Red Devils were near the top of this list having signed Matheus Cunha for £62.5m and Diego Leon for £3.3m early doors but fell off it having taken a laughable amount of time to secure the £65m signing of Bryan Mbeumo.",
      "",
      "5) Real Madrid – £144.4m\nThey had already dropped £50m on Dean Huijsen and £8.5m on a few weeks of Trent Alexander-Arnold before they agreed to sign man-child Franco Mastantuono for an awful lot of money. And then came Alvaro Carreras for another £43m.",
      "",
      "4) Manchester City – £153.21m\nThat’s the price of a Rayan Ait-Nouri from Wolves, a Rayan Cherki from Lyon, a Tijanji Reijnders from AC Milan, a Sverre Nypan from Rosenborg, and a James Trafford from Burnley, and all of them feel like bargains.",
      "",
      "3) Arsenal – £194.9m\nThe long-awaited and interminably drawn-out arrival of Viktor Gyokeres nudges Arsenal up towards a £200m summer but has plenty of final-piece-of-the-puzzle vibes as the Gunners leapfrog Real Madrid to make it a Premier League top three.",
      "",
      "2) Chelsea – £246.1m\nThey were the top spenders in the summers of 2024, 2023 and 2022 and will be up there in 2025 thanks to pre-arranged moves for Estevao, Dario Essugo, Mamadou Sarr and Kendry Paez. Throw in the £30m signing of Liam Delap and the Blues were already making very expensive waves before they signed Joao Pedro for an initial £55m and Jamie Gittens and Jorrel Hato for not much less.",
      "",
      "1) Liverpool – £263.5m\nFlorian Wirtz has cost an initial £100m (yes, it could rise to £116m but we’re not worried about add-ons on this particular list) and now have the top two most expensive signings of the summer after confirming the arrival of Hugo Ekitike from Eintracht Frankfurt. Full-backs Jeremie Frimpong and Milos Kerkez have joined for £29.5m and £40m respectively, and we have also added the £25m on Giorgi Mamardashvili as that transfer will be counted in this summer’s accounts."

      "We’d have loved this to be the official away kit, because it just seems very, very correct for Liverpool’s return to adidas to be marked by a green away kit given some of the iconic green Liverpool kits of the past.",
      "But had this been the away rather than third kit, it wouldn’t have had the adidas trefoil logo, so we’re going to say on balance we’re happy it’s the third. Because who doesn’t love a trefoil?",

There’s something just nice and wholesome anyway in the way one of the two football kit giants is willing to acknowledge the work of the other and, while most would correctly agree that adidas are the correct company to make Arsenal kits – we will not and cannot elaborate, it’s just fact – Nike certainly made some cult classics.",

      "It is so, so much better than last year’s away kit when, instead of drawing inspiration from a beloved Arsenal kit from the past a rare yet gigantic mis-step from the Germans saw them instead influenced by a bottle of Lynx Africa.",
      "The only minor grumble one could reasonably have here is the similarity to a third kit Arsenal had a few years ago, and thus the fact that this shirt could be argued to represent the running out of ideas, with adidas leaning on the lightning bolt motif yet again on yet another retro-inspired Arsenal shirt.",
      "To this we say: Yeah, whatever, just look at it. It is lovely. And that’s the real quiz.",
      "Another thing in this shirt’s favour is that we vastly prefer the simple cannon logo to Arsenal’s full shield badge. We know why they don’t, but we strongly feel they should always just have the cannon. It is better."

      "Remember, these are the correct opinions.",

      "But they’ve completely failed to put anywhere close to enough blue on here. Yes, Burnley have in the past dispensed with their traditional blue sleeves, but we don’t care for it and it will never look right.",
      "And even when blue sleeves have been missing, there has usually at least been something blue to compensate. In 2017/18 there was a very wide blue cuff to the sleeves, for instance. In 2006/07 there was blue on one sleeve and down one side of the shirt. In 2005/06 there was a blue central band to balance out the claret sleeves.",
      "This is overwhelmingly claret, and that doesn’t sit right with us at all. Even something we normally welcome damns Burnley here: sponsors 96.com have allowed the 9 to change from yellow to blue, and it looks far better for it. But it now becomes the standout blue feature of the shirt.",
      "",
      "18) Newcastle United\nAnnoying. Very, very annoying. Everything about this shirt is first class, apart from the single most important thing which single-handedly ruins it. The laser-blue accents and trim are absolutely lovely and exactly the right tertiary colour for a Newcastle home shirt. The stripes continuing right into the collar is bold but works but also brings us to the problem.",
      "Adidas have – unbelievably and unforgivably – f*cked up this most un-f*ck-up-able of football shirt elements. Newcastle’s black-and-white stripes are a strong contender for being the easiest of all football shirt details to get right. All you have to do is just make sure they’re not too thin, not too thick, all the same width, and with proper clean edges. Iconic. Done. Beautiful.",
      "It is our sorry duty to report they’ve f*cked around with the edges of the stripes. There’s a load of noise about this being ‘dynamic’ and other meaningless shite but it just makes them look hazy and removes all the crispness of a shirt otherwise dripping in it. Fools.",
      "One other damaging  detail to note here is that while the trend for selling ‘replica’ tops at a ridiculously high price and then also ‘authentic’ ones for an even higher one is something none of us can now stop, we can’t ever recall the differences between the very expensive replica and the remortgage-your-house authentic being quite so obviously first-glance visible as they are here, with the ‘replica’ version appearing to feature a plain black front half of the collar rather than the stripe continuation of the ‘authentic’.",
      "Feels like a massive swizz for an 85 quid t-shirt not to have something as basic yet central to a shirt as the right collar and dare we say it a deliberate attempt to nudge people towards the £120 version. We hope it doesn’t catch on, but fully expect it will.",

We’re not saying this is bad, we’re saying we’re not sure whether it’s bad or brilliant, and it’s that total lack of conviction that has rattled us into the shadow realm. If we can no longer be sure about sashes on football kits, than what certainties do we have left to cling to?",
      "We don’t think we’re being dramatic when we say this feels like it might be a harbinger of absolute doom for all mankind.

      "Our big problem, though, is the ‘lace-up’ collar detail. Officially, it’s ‘inspired by our original 1925 kit lace design’ but… it’s a bit wanky isn’t it? There is absolutely nothing on this earth stopping you from being inspired by a lace-up collar by having…a lace-up collar. There was a whole fad for them in the 1990s.",
      "Just sort of drawing a fake one on sadly reduces a shirt that could have been really good to something approaching a novelty. It’s just a little bit too close to ‘humorous T-shirt with a bow-tie drawn on it’ which is a shame.",

      "15) Tottenham\nA significant departure this for Tottenham with plenty of non-white areas here. That’s not unusual in itself; what’s unusual is that just as Spurs managers generally alternate in style and tone, so too their home kits operate on a rota switching between all-white (or nearly all-white) and more colourful.",

Now there’s less navy on this sleeve for sure, but it still constitutes a navy-heavy season, and with plenty of that silvery-blue-gray thrown in for good measure. That colourway brings to mind the Serhiy Rebrov-era late 90s adidas home shirt and we don’t mind that at all, in theory.",
      "We’re also comfortable enough with the central badge. We’re in general very much team crest-on-the-breast, but it just about works here because it is at least correctly accompanied by a central Nike swoosh (unlike last year’s duly unbalanced away kit) and Spurs have enough history of central-badge deployment to just about make it a legitimate option.",

      "It is absolutely fine but beyond the general feeling of correctness that comes from Liverpool having adidas kits, this isn’t one that on its own is going to grab anyone by the bollards. Just a bit too safe, in our view. The third kit is magnificent, though.",

Honestly, some people.",

      "12) Brighton\nNot too sure about the asymmetric collar – something Nike are keen on and seen last year on Spurs’ light blue away kit – but generally speaking it’s a bold and bright Brighton kit that we can all enjoy.",
      "One interesting quirk is that it’s almost entirely inverted from last year’s. That had white sleeves and blue cuffs, while this year it’s blue sleeves and white cuffs. Even the American Express logo has been flipped; it’s now white on a blue background instead of last year’s blue on white. Either way, it remains one of the less visually distracting sponsor logos around – and that’s especially tough to pull off on striped kits.",
      "The most exciting thing about Brighton’s kit, though, is that it takes the prestigious award for this season’s most overexcited and unnecessary made-up colour name. Football kit manufacturers rank second only to paint companies in this field, and we are beyond excited to tell you that the little turquoise flashes on the sides of this kit are not in fact just your common or garden turquoise but are in fact Hyper Turq.",

Because this might end up being our favourite kit of the lot, but based purely on the online pictures we’ve seen we’re not quite sure that carrying on the wave motif – an obvious nod to the new stadium and its dockside location – into the sleeves has quite paid off.",
      "What we do know for sure is that it’s a beautifully clean-looking Everton shirt for the start of their new era, and while this is no more than a personal preference, a crossover two-tone v-neck collar is absolutely S-tier football kit design in our view, so this scores perfect marks there.",
      "It’s powerfully reminiscent of classic Umbro-NEC era late-80s Everton. And one thing we’d note about that shirt is that the diamond pattern of the main body in that kit wasn’t continued into the sleeves. Not saying that proves anything, but it does show that there was the option to make that another nod to that classic kit.",

      "10) Arsenal\nThe key challenge for any home kit – away kits where almost anything goes have no such rules – is getting the right answer to one inevitably woolly and hard-to-define yet absolutely crucial question: Does it feel like a Team X kit? You’d be surprised how often this seemingly straightforward test is failed.",
      "For those of us whose football senses were hardwired in the late 80s and early 90s, Arsenal in an adidas kit means it’s almost impossible for them to get it wrong. And the new Arsenal home kit, with the purity of its red and white, could not be more Arsenal.",
      "It’s also a kit that merits viewing close-up in person, because the club’s classic gothic script A woven through it is a first-rate detail.",
      "Our quibbles are minor, but slightly too numerous for this to land right near the top of the list despite so much to recommend it. One is a very personal thing: we really like the old-school simplicity of the Arsenal cannon logo on last year’s kit, and if anything this is a kit for which it would appear even better suited, so it’s a shame in our irrelevant opinion to see the full shield badge restored.",
      "And having said last year’s shirt contained too much blue and praised the simplicity of this year’s, you’ll have to allow us a slight amount of hypocrisy in wondering whether it isn’t in fact, if anything Clive, almost too plain? Especially on that all-white round collar? A tiny amount of navy could have done wonders here.",
      "But we’re nitpicking. Arsenal’s red and white is suitably iconic that they are always better served erring on the side of simplicity – especially when they’ve got the adidas stripes which just look more correct here than anywhere else in the game. Certainly better this than going too heavy on the tertiary colour or, worse still, gilding the lily with unnecessarily gaudy gold as they have in the recent past.",
      "",
      "9) Aston Villa\nWe’re normally quick to dismiss ‘draws inspiration from…’ stuff in kit launches as so much nauseating PR bumwash – especially with this year’s cohort offering a surely record-breaking quantity of said bumwash – but Villa have done it well here with a little bit of sleeve detail that makes obvious yet understated reference to the Holte End. It works in a similar way to Everton’s little Goodison architecture tribute a couple of years back.",
      "We’d have liked to see that detailing from the cuffs extended to the collar, because we really aren’t at all sold on the chunky plain T-shirt collars that so many kits seem to have next season.",

      "— Official AVFC News (@OffAVFCNews) June 11, 2025",
      "Other than that, it’s fine. The gold piping is handled with care and, by working in tandem with that Holte End pattern avoids taking a trip to gaudy-town and it absolutely manages to pass the ‘Feels like a Villa kit’ which is among the harder to pull off in a league with multiple claret-and-blue merchants, albeit perhaps easier this year with both Burnley and West Ham opting – with contrasting results – to lean into the claret.",
      "",
      "8) Chelsea\nThe metallic badges and swirling design of last year have been replaced by a more classic look for a club that has, in general, been among the most consistent deliverers of decent home kits over the years and decades.",
      "Chelsea does always feel like a home kit you have to actually try and f*ck up, and last year it did feel a little bit like that’s precisely what Nike were doing. It’s one that rewards a ‘isn’t broken, don’t fix it’ mentality. And that means lots and lots of blue, a tiny bit of white, and an even smaller flash of red.",
      "In other words, this year’s Chelsea kit has nailed that brief. The fact it is once again, for now, also sponsorless because Chelsea are such unlike-the-rest disruptors also works far better in combination with the traditional-look-with-modern-styling nature of this year’s shirt in contrast to last year’s more try-hard effort.",
      "Very, very good indeed.",
      "",
      "7) Crystal Palace\nWorth the wait, this one. We didn’t even know for the longest time whether Palace were sticking with Macron or moving on, but it’s Macron once again and it’s another hit. We very much enjoyed what we dubbed the firework kit last season, but what has been sensibly decided here is that it’s wise to follow up that properly bonkers interpretation of Palace’s red and blue stripes with something a bit more traditional this time around.",
      "But what they’ve not done is go all the way down that road to Boringville. The red and blue are both bright and vibrant, and given some real extra pop by the standout detail which is those white pinstripes between each main stripe.",
      "The collar is first-rate, too, and our only real quibble is with the white panel on the sleeves. On the long-sleeve version especially, it starts to look more like an extra stripe, and blue and white stripes are very much not the order of the day on Palace kits please and thank you. Solid blue here on the shoulders to go with the red underarm – or even just replacing thee white stripe with a red one – and you’d have a top-three contender.",

But better to wait for a nice one than confirm a sh*t one, as we always say.",
      "Inevitably, the combination of red-and-white stripes plus hummel leads us down a vaguely Southampton route here, but while ‘is it obviously a Team X kit’ is one of our core criteria we are going to cut some slack here because we simply don’t think there’s any way around that particular puzzle without abandoning hummel altogether, and we’re very much in baby-with-the-bathwater territory there.",
      "Lovely simple kit, this, so much so that we don’t even mind the centred badge because everything is at least balanced. Collar is 10/10, the chevrons look as magnificent as ever, and quite simply hummel have done it again, as they nearly always do. Great bunch of lads.",

Fingers crossed anyway, but it definitely looks more gold than last season’s just too yellow offering.",
      "We generally leave sponsors out of these as far as we can, because let’s face it pretty much all of them spoil a shirt to some degree or other, but DEBET’s logo being all black this year rather than having colour on the ‘toothpaste’ bit of the first E also definitely helps Wolves stick the retro-vibe landing here.",

      "Sesko was absent from RB Leipzig's pre-season friendly loss to Atalanta on Saturday due to his expected departure from the club. The striker has reportedly told his team-mates that he will be leaving, according to Sky in Germany.",
      "Marcel Schafer, RB Leipzig's managing director for sport, confirmed clubs have made approaches for Sesko.",
      "\"We won't go into detail on that but when I say that several clubs have shown strong interest and have made approaches, it's obvious what has happened,\" he said.",
      "Newcastle are also interested in Yoane Wissa, who was not part of Brentford's squad for their friendly against QPR on Saturday as he pushes for a move.",
      "Newcastle head coach Eddie Howe said Newcastle are only \"looking for the best\" in terms of transfer targets amid a challenging window for the club.",
      "Not only have the Magpies been hit by Isak's desire to leave, but they have also missed out on a number of transfer targets to rivals including Liam Delap, Joao Pedro, Hugo Ekitike and James Trafford.",
      "Newcastle have also hit a roadblock in their pursuit of Wissa after having a £25m bid knocked back, but the Brentford striker is still not featuring for Keith Andrews' first team.",
      "AccaFreeze lets you lock in one winning leg of your football acca, so a late goal won't ruin your bet!",
      "With Callum Wilson joining West Ham, it leaves just Will Osula as their only recognised first-team striker on their pre-season tour of Asia.",
      "\"We're looking for the best players that we can get,\" said Howe. \"Whatever our target position is, we're looking for the best so I see all situations open and available to us.",
      "\"I feel that's the only way that we're going to get to where we want to go, which is to maximise, and it's quality over quantity. It always has been. That's always been the way that we try to work and the way that we try to recruit, and I think we've done it pretty well to this point.",
      "\"It's been a challenging summer, because we've missed out on various targets for loads of different reasons, but we're still very competitive, and we're still in there trying to bring very good players to the club - and that won't change until the window shuts.\""

      "Monday 4 August 2025 14:44, UK",
      "Manchester United and Everton played out an entertaining 2-2 draw in Atlanta as Ruben Amorim’s side won the Premier League Summer Series.",
      "In a game which featured a first Manchester United appearance for Bryan Mbeumo, their £71m signing from Brentford, Everton twice came from behind to claim their first point of the tournament.",
      "Bruno Fernandes' first-half penalty, following a foul by James Tarkowski on Amad Diallo, was cancelled out by Iliman Ndiaye, who finished emphatically from Idrissa Gueye's cross after Vitalii Mykolenko had robbed Manuel Ugarte.",
      "Substitute Mason Mount put Manchester United back in front when he turned and curled a superb finish beyond Jordan Pickford from Fernandes' pass, but Everton levelled again when Amad's attempted clearance struck Ayden Heaven and went into the net.",
      "The freakish own goal, which occurred as Fernandes kicked out at Ndiaye, who reacted by shoving him as both players were booked, denied Manchester United a third consecutive win at the Premier League Summer Series but they still finished as winners, a point ahead of West Ham in the four-team group.",
      "As in the previous games against West Ham and Bournemouth, there were positives for Amorim, particularly in the first half, when his side produced several slick attacks and Mbeumo combined smartly with Fernandes and fellow new signing Matheus Cunha.",
      "Mbeumo was replaced by Patrick Dorgu at half-time and the game lost its rhythm as both sides made changes in the second period, with new Everton signing Adam Aznou among those introduced.",
      "Manchester United had a late chance to win it when Mount played in Dorgu but the wing-back's diagonal shot was well saved by Pickford to round off a much-improved performance from Everton following their defeats to Bournemouth and West Ham.",
      "Bruno Fernandes said the Premier League Summer Series has helped bring Manchester United's players together but rued \"laziness\" in their performance against Everton.",
      "\"It's been important for developing how we want to play and getting the new players involved too.",
      "\"We didn't want to finish in this way. Our performance wasn't the best and we were a little bit lazy today.",
      "\"We want to avoid that because with laziness you can pay at any moment.\"",
      "On Manchester United's summer transfer activity, he added: \"I don't want to take a dig at anyone but the club is doing the best they can in terms of the financial situation they talk about.",
      "\"But it was crystal clear we needed more competition for the players that were here, more quality to get everyone to step up a little bit more, and I think that is what the club are trying to do.",
      "\"Hopefully we can get one or two players more to help with that.\"",
      "His first run in behind Everton's defence came inside the very first minute of the game. Soon afterwards, he was dropping deep to release Bruno Fernandes and launch an attack. Some time later, fans cheered as he dribbled out of danger in his own half.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo only played 45 minutes of Manchester United's 2-2 draw with Everton on Sunday but even in that short timeframe he offered plenty of evidence to show just how much he can bring to Ruben Amorim's attack following his £71m arrival from Brentford.",
      "The 25-year-old's early withdrawal showed there is work to do to build his fitness but he looked sharp, starting in an inside right position, behind Matheus Cunha, but interchanging roles with the Brazilian throughout the first half, his movement causing problems.",
      "He was involved in the build-up to the penalty, releasing Amad Diallo with an instinctive first-time pass, and went close to scoring himself, first when he tested Jordan Pickford from a free-kick, and again when he had two efforts in quick succession blocked.",
      "As became customary at Brentford, his speed and dynamism was a major feature of his performance. His forward runs provided a foil for Fernandes and there were early signs of chemistry with Amad and Cunha. All in all, this was a positive start by Manchester United's new No 19. He looks primed to make a big impact.",
      "Ruben Amorim was pleased with Bryan Mbeumo's first Manchester United appearance.",
      "\"He played well,\" he said. \"He needs to understand the position, the movements, but first his touch, the way he connected with one touch, opened a lot of space.",
      "\"You can see he's not in perfect condition, physically, but he makes a lot of runs and that can stretch a team.\"",

      "\"One team can always improve with more players, but we have players to make that competition. We need to improve as a team and we have potential to improve with our players and I'm really happy with the squad.\"",
      "After a 15th-placed finish in the Premier League last season and defeat in the final of the Europa League to Tottenham, Fernandes also called on United to start to show a winning mentality again, and he challenged the players to show it on the pitch.",
      "He said: \"Every small thing matters. At this football club you cannot do anything wrong on or off the pitch because it is too big worldwide and you get punished by that.",
