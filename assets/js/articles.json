      "Ruben Amorim has warned that his team are not ready to be competitive in the Premier League and take on Champions League responsibilities. Manchester United fell to their 16th league defeat against Brentford on Sunday despite nearing qualification for Europe's top competition.",
      "The Red Devils lost 4-3 to the Bees in west London after taking the lead through Mason Mount. A Luke Shaw own goal, Kevin Schade brace and Yoane Wissa effort handed Thomas Frank's side a healthy lead before late goals from Alejandro Garnacho and Amad Diallo narrowed the scoreline.",
      "Amorim's side sit 15th in the division but are on the verge of a place in the Europa League final after a win over Athletic Bilbao. Winning the competition would secure a place in the Champions League.",
      "But United's Portuguese boss has some reservations about his side's ability to contend with the schedule. Amorim rotated his side against Brentford to prioritise the club's European ambitions.",
      "\"I have no doubt that we are playing better. So we have to take all the heat,\" he said. \"At this moment we are losing games in the Premier League. We are fighting for the Europe league and Thursday is the most important game for us.\"",
      "\"We are not ready to play Premier League competitive and be in the Champions League,\" he added. \"But we need to win and we need to win this competition to give something to our fans.",
      "\"Then we will have time to prepare the team to cope with those two competitions.\"",
      "Amorim was forced to replace Matthijs de Ligt against the Bees as the Dutchman's first start following injury was short-lived. The ex-Bayern Munich defender was replaced in the opening 45 minutes.",
      "And the United boss has been left concerned about De Ligt's condition as he continues to manage his squad. Amorim is worried about the impact the injury could have on next season.",
      "\"I don't know so I'm really concerned - not about Thursday,\" said Amorim. \"We took off Luke Shaw at half-time to protect and have players for Thursday, but I'm more concerned whether it is a small or big injury and thinking about next season.\""

      "Ruben Amorim admits that he's 'really concerned' about Matthijs de Ligt after the Manchester United star suffered another injury against Brentford. De Ligt, 25, was making his first start since April 1 but hobbled off just 35 minutes into United's damning 4-3 defeat.",
      "The Dutch centre-back collided with Brentford forward Yoane Wissa in the lead-up to the home side's second goal in the first half. On came Harry Maguire, who De Ligt had replaced on Thursday as United saw out their impressive 3-0 win away to Athletic Bilbao in the Europa League semi-finals.",
      "\"I don't know so I'm really concerned,\" Amorim replied. \"Not about Thursday - we took off Luke Shaw at half-time to protect and have players for Thursday - but I'm more concerned whether it is a small or big injury and thinking about next season.\"",
      "Amorim confessed that his squad isn't 'ready' to compete in both the Premier League and Champions League yet, with injuries blighting his first half-season in charge. United's only chance of qualifying for the Champions League is by winning the Europa League final later this month.",
      "\"We are not ready to play Premier League competitive and be in the Champions League, but we need to win and we need to win this competition to give something to our fans,\" Amorim vowed. \"Then we will have time to prepare the team to cope with those two competitions.\"",

      "\"So we have to take all the heat. At this moment we are losing games in the Premier League. We are fighting for the Europa League and Thursday is the most important game for us.\"",
      "He added on the Brentford loss: \"We started well, we controlled quite well and then throw-ins and set-pieces was a problem for us, but that is normal for us because we didn't have the height with the team. We fought back and we were near - we tried to push and in the end we lose.\""

      "You can’t win anything with kids - not for about the last 30 years, anyway.",
      "And as Ruben Amorim decorated the road to Bilbao with the ruins of Manchester United ’s 16th Premier League defeat this season, former Match of the Day pundit Alan Hansen’s famous soundbite proved devastatingly accurate. Don’t fall for any salesmen’s patter about this being a seven-goal thriller.",
      "Brentford put the third-youngest line-up in Premier League history to the sword to keep the Bees on the scent of pollen and honey in Europe next season. Copenhagen-on-Thames is a nice day out for a stroll along the Thames towpath or crossing the bridge to see the Great Pagoda in Kew Gardens, but for United it has often contained all the charms of a minefield.",
      "Three years ago, in a prologue to his rancorous exit, Cristiano Ronaldo threw a monumental strop when unlamented interim manager Ralf Rangnick dared to substitute him here. Seven months later, Erik ten Hag’s reign was almost stillborn when United shipped four goals in the opening 45 minutes, a debacle which led to Harry Maguire being stripped of the captaincy.",
      "And now, with one foot in the Europa League final, Amorim risked further ignominy by making eight changes. There is nothing wrong with promoting youth, and nobody does it better than the club who gave us the Busby Babes and the Class of ’92.",
      "But with an average age of 22 years and 270 days, United's starting XI was only behind Middlesbrough against Fulham in May 2006 (20 years, 181 days) and Arsenal ’s side against Portsmouth in 2009 (22 years, 237 days) for inexperience. And at 17 years 156 days, striker Chido Obi became the youngest United player to start a Premier League game as Amorim channelled his inner Star Wars fanboy: May the fourth be with you, Obi.",
      "Yet if the Premier League is an unforgiving environment for Babybel kids in a jungle of big cheeses, at least it does not diminish the audacity of youth, and after 14 minutes the Cub Devils had the temerity to go in front. Alejandro Garnacho’s low, first-time cross was turned home from six yards by Mason Mount, his first goal since March 2024 and only his second for United - both against the Bees.",
      "Mount’s career at Old Trafford has been permanently stuck on the launch-pad awaiting take-off, and at 26 he is in danger of having a bright future behind him. Much the same can be said of United’s dreadful domestic campaign, and two goals in six minutes soon disabused them of the fanciful notion that the kids would be all right.",
      "First Mikkel Damsgaard poked Michael Kayode’s header beyond Altay Bayindir at his near post, with the help of a telling deflection off acting United skipper Luke Shaw, for the equaliser. Then, with Matthijs De Ligt lying on the floor and signalling that he would need to be replaced, Christian Norgaard charged into the gap behind the stricken Dutchman and crossed for Kevin Schade to plunder his 10th goal of the season with a soaring header.",
      "United’s token protests to referee Anthony Taylor that he should have intervened fell on deaf ears and, in fairness, the law is explicit: Play is only stopped in the event of head injuries. Maybe if players didn’t roll around feigning mortal wounds, genuine cases of distress like De Ligt’s thigh problem would be taken more seriously.",
      "Bravely United waited until the last 20 minutes to fold after De Ligt’s limping evacuation, but it was pitiful stuff. Schade was unmarked on the far post to head home Bryan Mbeumo’s deflected cross, and four minutes later the remnants of Amorim’s defence were sliced open again, Yoane Wissa rolling his 18th goal of the season into an empty net from Kayode’s pass.",
      "The persevering Garnacho’s 25-yard rocket was useful damage limitation, and substitute Amad, making his first Premier League appearance since February, added another in stoppage time. But United’s window dressing was fooling nobody.",
      "They will have to keep it much tighter on the shop floor against Athletic Bilbao on Thursday night."

      "Brentford condemned Manchester United to more Premier League misery at the Gtech Community Stadium with a swashbuckling 4-3 victory to bring Ruben Amorim and Co back down to earth.",
      "Amorim made eight changes for the trip to London as United's big-name stars from midweek were afforded time to recuperate ahead of the second leg of their Europa League semi-final against Athletic Bilbao next week.",
      "United's youthful team even hit the front after 14 minutes when Mason Mount finished a neat one-touch move from six yards after being teed up by Alejandro Garnacho. But they had to weather an early storm to do so and Brentford got the leveller their play merited just over 10 minutes later when a Mikkel Damsgaard effort was diverted into the back of United's net by Luke Shaw. They then turned the game completely on its head through Kevin Schade just six minutes later to leave United shellshocked.",
      "The visitors improved after the break as Amorim turned to his bench. But a second from Schade and another goal from Yoane Wissa helped Brentford over the line as goals from Garnacho and Amad helped set up a grandstand finish.",
      "United may have struck first but it was Brentford who were in the ascendancy from the word go. They were slick and purposeful going forward and it always felt like the pressure would eventually tell on a youthful Manchester United team, even if Mount's 14th minute opener wasn't in the script for the hosts.",
      "This result keeps them in the mix for European qualification and on this evidence - plus the fixtures they have outstanding - you wouldn't bet against them. Thomas Frank has been given his flowers on more than one occasion during Brentford's top-flight tenure but he deserves so much more. Quite how one of the 'Big Six' have not come calling is beyond belief given the managerial turnover we've seen in some quarters. The only danger for Brentford is that more of the same - and a European tour - could change that.",
      "United had won just three of their previous 21 Premier League games played in London prior to their joust with the Bees. And while this loss may not be as bruising as some of the 15 they had suffered beforehand in the league given their personnel changes, their latest showing in the capital certainly won't live long in the memory.",
      "Bar the odd moment - particularly their opening goal - United look second best all over the pitch against a Brentford side who were snapping at their heels. If anything, Amorim's men were fortunate to make it to the break just one goal behind as the hosts unloaded a barrage of attacks on them towards the end of the first-half, with Altay Bayindir putting a nervy start behind him to keep the Bees at bay.",
      "But he couldn't keep Brentford at bay as the hosts gleefully set about laying down a market to their European rivals - even if they did have to survive a late scare.",
      "United can still salvage what has been a sorry season with victory in the Europa League, which would land them a golden ticket to the Champions League next year. So Amorim absolutely made the right move in shuffling his pack and resting a host of his more established stars given United are going nowhere fast in the Premier League standings between now and the end of the month.",
      "But United did not leave the capital unscathed with Matthijs de Ligt suffering an injury in the build-up to Brentford's second goal. The former Bayern Munich man did not look at all comfortable as he left the pitch and it wouldn't be a surprise to see him miss the biggest match of United's season on Thursday when they try and book their spot in the Europa League final.",
      "That will be a bitter pill to swallow for both him and Amorim, who would have been desperate to head back up the M1 with a clean bill of health.",
      "In an era where tactics are king and players are drilled to within an inch of their life, the havoc that Brentford's Michael Kayode caused with his long throws was almost refreshing.",
      "Manchester United looked vulnerable from set-pieces all afternoon and it was no surprise that their leveller came from the second phase of a Kayode special. It was the Italian who beat Harry Amass in the air to keep the play alive and Brentford bagged the ultimate reward. The 20-year-old is no one-trick pony, though: he was just as impressive in open play and will only get better as he acclimatises to the Premier League.",
      "United's recruitment is often scrutinised but Brentford more than often get it right in the transfer market. Kayode - signed on loan with an option in January - looks like another win.",
      "Manchester United are in need of a big summer if they are to banish this sorry season to the history books. Bryan Mbeumo is just one of a host of players who have been linked with United in recent weeks, and Sunday's game was the perfect occasion for him to show why.",
      "And even on a quiet afternoon, the Cameroon international conjured up some magic in the second half to put the game beyond United, awaking from his slumber to put the ball on a plate for Brentford's third goal.",
      "Mbuemo, 25, is versatile, deadly in the final third and affordable when compared to some of United's previous transfer dealings. This may not have been the complete 'audition' of sorts if United are mulling over a move, but Mbuemo's quality is undeniable. His assist underlined that and how United could do with somebody capable of conjuring up moments like that to ease the burden on Bruno Fernandes."

      "But now there will be fresh concerns over the 25-year-old after he needed to be replaced against Brentford. The ex-Juventus star was helped from the pitch by a United physio.",

      "\"We want to win games. In this league, it’s really important for us, but we have to make a choice. And it’s not [just] about the players you put in these kind of games, it’s putting all these players together.",

A source explains that the opportunity to play abroad has helped Greenwood and his partner, Harriet Robson, 'rebuild their lives' after charges of attempted rape, assault and controlling and coercive behaviour against the striker were dropped by the Crown Prosecution Service.",
      "But 'the novelty has worn off' for Greenwood, who would like to move back to the north west with his partner and their two young daughters should the opportunity arise.",
      "It's claimed that Greenwood's desire for a return to England has put 'a string of clubs' on alert ahead of the upcoming transfer window. Manchester United would stand to benefit financially if Greenwood were to move on again due to a sell-on clause which was inserted in the deal that took him across the channel last summer.",
      "Despite Greenwood's impressive returns in front of goal, his time in France has not been without its challenges. His application has been questioned by De Zerbi, while the club's Ultras unfurled a banner urging Greenwood to \"get a move on\", a swipe at his work ethic.",

      "For their part, Betis believe Antony has already given them his word. They would be more interested in agreeing another loan deal with United however.",
      "Meanwhile reports in Spain claim that Atletico have made contact over the possibility of agreeing a deal this summer. And that could leave United determined to drive an auction.",
      "There is even said to be some optimism in Manchester that recouping up to £42.5m could be possible. United however, have parked any formal transfer negotiations until the end of the season as they focus on earning European glory in the Europa League.",
      "Former Spain international and Betis icon Joaquin is now on the La Liga side's board. The ex-winger has joked he would be willing to kidnap Antony in a bid to keep him at the club.",
      "\"I'll provide the car if he has to be kidnapped, but let him stay no matter what,\" said Joaquin. \"This is the moment to enjoy. I think important moments will come and we'll see later.\"",
      "Ex-Manchester United goalkeeper David De Gea was in net when Antony found the net against Fiorentina on Thursday. The Spanish shotstopper is pleased that his former team-mate has finally been able to show his quality, though frustrated it came against him.",
      "\"I trained with him 1,000 times and he never scored a goal with his right foot in any training session,\" De Gea told Movistar Plus after sharing a moment with Antony post-match. \"But now he's confident and is showing the player he is.",
      "\"I haven't seen the shot in any matches, I think a player was in front of it and I couldn't see it, but he hit it well with his right foot. I'm happy for him because he was coming from a difficult moment at United and now he's showing the best of himself.\""

      "Solskjaer was shown the door in 2021 after a string of poor results to begin the season. Throughout his tenure plenty had questioned whether he had the ability to truly lead the Manchester outfit back to the summit of English football.",
      "A 4-1 loss to Watford in November was their fifth reverse in seven games and ultimately cost Solskjaer his job. During their poor run they were humiliated 5-0 at home by Liverpool whilst Manchester City also secured a dominant win at Old Trafford.",
      "Ralf Rangnick was hired as Solskjaer's replacement, but failed to take the club forward before leaving after less than a year. Erik ten Hag, despite winning two trophies, failed to find the winning formula with Ruben Amorim now also struggling in the dugout.",
      "United will post their worst ever Premier League finish this season as they languish in the bottom half. The club are miles away from the success they enjoyed during Sir Alex Ferguson's era and Solskjaer concedes the table makes for grim reading every week.",
      "He told the BBC: \"Man United is my family and will always be part of me. In football, you don't feel sorry for anyone because we are privileged, absolutely 100% privileged to be able to work in clubs like this. But for me, it is hard to watch because it is your family that is struggling. It is never easy at the weekend when you look at the table.\"",

      "The defender endured mixed fortunes and copped regular criticism with Solskjaer urged to drop the England centre-half, despite choosing to make him captain. Maguire has since endured a renaissance and the ex-United boss was always confident he would come good.",
      "He said: \"For me, Harry [Maguire] has always been a leader and a fighter. I was never in doubt when I signed him and he walked in the door he would be captain for us. There is another captain there in Bruno [Fernandes]. The two of them are top human beings. I was so happy for them last night. Those two and Victor [Lindelof] are probably the only ones I have heard from in the club since I left. You want the best for them.\""

      "Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has doubled down on his claim that Manchester United shouldn’t have sold Scott McTominay. The Red Devils academy graduate quit Old Trafford last summer after a successful spell with the club.",
      "Italian giants Napoli sealed a £21m deal for the midfielder and he has gone on to be an inspired signing. McTominay has scored 12 goals in all competitions this season - the best goalscoring season of his career.",
      "That form has been crucial to Napoli’s title charge this term, with Antonio Conte’s men sitting three points clear at the top of Serie A. Solskjaer, McTominay’s former Man United manager, has slammed the decision to sell him, a call that looks even worse given the club’s woeful form this term.",
      "Speaking to the BBC, Solskjaer said: \"Scott and Fred together, they were lads you would put your hat on every day to give 100%. How you can sell Scott is beyond me.\"",
      "It is not the first time that the Norwegian has criticised United’s call to jettison McTominay. Speaking earlier this season, the now Besiktas boss said: “It’s still good to see Bruno Fernandes and Harry (Maguire) doing well.",
      "“And Scotty [Scott McTominay] is doing well at Napoli. I’m upset that we let him go because he was important last season when he kept popping up with goals. His heart and his knowledge of the culture were important.”",
      "Solskjaer is not the only former United manager to publicly criticise the club for selling McTominay. Erik ten Hag also claimed that he didn’t want the midfielder to leave, only to be forced into the decision by PSR.",
      "\"I’m very happy for Scott. As I said, when he left, I didn’t want this but that’s the rules the club had to deal with. The rules are, I would even say, bad, but that’s the situation created. It forced us to make this decision,\" he said.",
      "Elsewhere, Liverpool hero Graeme Souness has also questioned McTominay’s exit, while claiming club chiefs might be looking to bring him back sooner rather than later. Speaking to the Daily Mail, he said: \"Oh how Manchester United must regret selling Scott McTominay. He’s a fantastic modern footballer. A high-energy, box-to-box workaholic who chips in with important goals.",
      "\"He was 27 years old and not hurting United with his wages when the club’s ‘decision-makers’ thought it was a bright idea to sell him to Napoli for £25million. They’d gone out and spent £58m on an ageing, 30-year-old Casemiro, and paid him £370,000 a week. And another £42m on Manuel Ugarte. Collective transfer fees of £100m.",
      "\"Would someone at United please hold their hand up and say, This was my shout’. Because it’s been an atrocious piece of judgment.",
      "\"The perfect example of the mismanagement on an industrial scale at that club since Fergie packed in. McTominay has flourished at Napoli. Maybe United should be asking themselves how much it will cost to get him back.\""

      "Manchester United are growing optimistic they can recoup up to £42.5million (€50m) for Antony this summer in a major boost for Ruben Amorim's finances. The 25-year-old Brazilian has netted six goals and provided four assists for Real Betis since joining the club on loan in January.",
      "And Betis believe Antony has already given them his word that he would like to stay at the club beyond the end of the season. However, United are currently parking formal transfer negotiations until the end of the campaign as both clubs are currently fighting tooth and nail for European glory but in the background.",
      "Despite that, United have already decided that the signings of a new striker and No.10, namely Matheus Cunha, are their top priorities and they want to make those deals happen as quickly as possible.",
      "Antony scored for Betis on Thursday in their Conference League semi-final victory over Fiorentina and Old Trafford chiefs are also keen to hand other sides the chance to throw their hat into the ring.",
      "Atletico Madrid have also reportedly enquired about Antony's availability and United are determined to drive an auction as they know Betis might struggle to match their financial demands over a permanent transfer.",
      "Betis' preference would be to secure another loan for the ex-Ajax attacker, who joined the Red Devils in a deal worth up to £86m in August 2022, but United will push for a sale to bolster Amorim's spending power.",
      "Betis icon Joaquin, now part of the club's board, recently joked he's willing to kidnap Antony in a bid to keep him at the club, telling Spanish TV: \"I'll provide the car if he has to be kidnapped, but let him stay no matter what. This is the moment to enjoy. I think important moments will come and we'll see later.\"",
      "Antony's agent Junior Pedroso recently hit back at United boss Amorim over claims the winger struggled with the physicality of the Premier League.",
      "Still, the Brazil international appears to still respect the Portuguese coach, recently saying of Amorim: \"I've only had a short time working with [Amorim], but he's a very good coach.",
      "\"A very intelligent coach. United are going through a difficult time at the moment, but he's a good coach. I had a good relationship with him, but I needed a new challenge and I wish him all the luck in the world in this final stretch of the season.\"",
      "Interestingly, Betis saw loan bids for Antony and Christian Eriksen knocked back last August by United as Erik ten Hag wanted to keep the duo.",
      "But Antony only played 135 minutes of Premier League action during the first half of the campaign and the Red Devils were keen to save cash on his wages. His value has since sky-rocketed on the back of his fine form in Seville and United view the loan as a huge success."

The left-back, 22, joined Benfica from United last year and has caught the eye of clubs across Europe thanks to his impressive performances.",
      "When they agreed to sell Carreras for around £5million, United negotiated a buyback clause which is worth £17m. Benfica themselves moved to put a £51m release clause in the Spaniard's contract.",
      "Real are reluctant to pay such a high price in the summer transfer window, so have reportedly come up with a workaround. The Spanish giants, who Carreras spent three years with at youth level, are said to want United to activate their buyback clause and then immediately sell him to them for £29m.",
      "That'd net United a cool £12m in profit which would improve their well-documented financial situation, with Ruben Amorim's summer recruitment plans hinging on big-money sales. But Carreras' agent, Gines Carvajal, has poured cold water on suggestiosn that Real and United could form the controversial agreement.",
      "\"I don't know where this news comes from,\" Carvajal is quoted as saying by Sport. \"Everything being said is pure invention and doesn't deserve any comment from me.\"",
      "The agent went on to confirm that Carreras won't be going anywhere this summer, adding: \"Carreras is doing very well at Benfica and will continue there.\"",
      "In January, the 22-year-old affirmed that he was 'happy' playing for the Portuguese giants, who are battling city rivals Sporting Lisbon for both the league and cup with just a few games to go.",
      "\"I have a contract for many years here at Benfica, I'm happy,\" Carreras declared via Record. \"They gave me the opportunity to grow, and I owe everything to them.\"",
      "Having left Madrid in 2020, Carreras never made a first-team appearance for United. He was loaned out to Preston North End, Granada and then Benfica, who signed him permanently in January 2024.",
      "United are well-stocked at left-back as things stand. The Red Devils signed Patrick Dorgu for £25m in January and have Luke Shaw back from injury.",
      "Tyrell Malacia is also due back from his loan spell with PSV Eindhoven unless the Dutch heavyweights sign him permanently. And finally, academy product Harry Amass made his Premier League debut in March and appears to be highly rated by United boss Amorim."

They were much more forgiving than the invective aimed at the spineless players after their last four-goal humbling at the same stadium two seasons ago.",
      "United's followers sang about a second trip to Bilbao in May seconds after kick-off. They should be reassured that Ruben Amorim will judge this United squad on their preposterous Premier League campaign, rather than the possibility of a new attraction in the club museum.",
      "The numbers are stark: 15th in the league, -9 goal difference, 16 defeats and ten wins from 35 matches. United have still not hit the 40-point mark. All after investing £200million in the squad in the summer under a manager they did not want to keep.",
      "After Kevin Schade put Brentford 3-1 up, the away end broke into a chorus of \"'Cause United are going to Bilbao\". They did so again after the fourth, outsinging the Brentford denizens. United's players have earned a reprieve through their Europa League form.",
      "United are just like watching Seville in that competition. Not in the Premier League. That has been a write off since the start of the calendar year and they have the good fortune to be surrounded by West Ham United and Tottenham, two teams still below them in a loveless marriage with their manager.",
      "Even the worst domestic United team in 51 years has an aura. Brentford fans were audibly apprehensive when seven added minutes were announced with the scoreline 4-2. Amad's first goal on his Premier League return suggested they were right to be concerned. Unlike last week, there was not an added-time equaliser for United.",
      "Amorim started the third-youngest-ever Premier League side, a trick of the mind given the strength of the United squad that travelled to West London. Twenty-year-olds Alejandro Garnacho and Kobbie Mainoo have played for the club more than 200 times between them. The former got the goal of the game.",
      "Chido Obi was United's youngest starter in the Premier League and it was apparent why he had to wait three months for a full debut after his emergence at Tottenham. Against Brentford's imposing three-man backline, Obi looked exactly what he is: an underdeveloped 17-year-old rookie.",
      "Amorim smacked his hands together in the 50th minute in an attempt to jolt a meandering performance. The introductions of Amad and Leny Yoro upped the seniority, if not the average age yet Amorim was still dissatisfied 12 minutes later, demanding the ball be played more urgently. United never really got it rolling.",
      "1,725 United fans were tucked away in the snooker-table pocket of an away end. The game was not 25 minutes old and they had aired their paeans to Ji-sung Park, Wes Brown, Jaap Stam, John O'Shea, Andy Cole, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and Roy Keane.",
      "The sequence was only interrupted by Luke Shaw's own goal. Captaining United for the first time, Shaw almost nodded past Altay Bayindir in the third minute before he deflected Mikkel Damsgaard's hooked cross into his own net.",
      "Tyler Fredricson continued from where he left off against Wolves, his commanding defending in front of the away section causing an eruption from his fellow Mancunians. Shaw and Matthijs de Ligt applauded him heartily. Eventually, Fredricson was outmuscled through Brentford's aerial prowess.",
      "Still, Fredricson had a better afternoon than his fellow centre halves. De Ligt was piqued by Brentford's goal at Old Trafford when he was ordered off to have blood cleaned from his crown. This time, De Ligt was down and out on the pitch as Brentford played on to score.",
      "Amorim shook his head. That reaction might have been reserved for Patrick Dorgu's dozy defending at the far post. Amorim checked on De Ligt, clutching his knee and leaning on physio Jordan Reece, as he limped towards the tunnel.",
      "Shaw and Dorgu followed De Ligt off at half-time. Dorgu was only scheduled to play 45 minutes in the absence of a senior right winger when he ought to have been on the bench or back in Manchester with Noussair Mazraoui. Shaw's withdrawal felt more tactical than planned as United strove to avoid another league loss.",
      "The 39-year-old Tom Heaton should feel hard done by, watching Bayindir. Brentford fans sounded optimistic whenever the ball was played to Andre Onana's deputy and the sole surprise of his first-half performance was that Bayindir made two stops to keep United only one goal behind.",
      "As iffy as Bayindir's kicking was, it was his opposite number who played his team into trouble. Mainoo and Garnacho were still only just inside the Brentford half when they collaborated incisively for Mount to tap in on his first start since December 15.",
      "Both of Mount's goals for United have come at Brentford and this was considerably earlier than his 96th-minute effort last year. United are not as chaotic as back then but they are worse. In the Premier League, at least.",

      "Amorim could be seen shaking his head after Brentford played on with De Ligt seeking medical treatment. Kevin Schade scored from Christian Norgaard's cross and referee Anthony Taylor was not obliged to halt play as De Ligt did not suffer a head injury.",
      "\"I will not comment on that,\" Amorim said of the incident. \"The important thing is to have Mattha, not thinking about Thursday. Not a big issue, is the only thing I ask is not to have him available for this game or whatever is going to happen in the future.",
      "\"I just don’t want a big issue because we had a problem with Licha. With Mattha, I don’t know. I’m just talking, I have no idea. He could be training in three days, I don’t know.\"",
      "United went 1-0 up at Brentford through Mason Mount's second goal for the club in the 14th minute yet Brentford went 4-1 up before late goals from Alejandro Garnacho and Amad threatened another United comeback.",
      "The result marked United's 16th league loss of the season, the first time they have lost that many since 1989-90. United are winless in six league games and have won six out of 24 overall under Amorim.",
      "\"I think it’s a little bit a reflection of our season,\" Amorim added of the result. \"We start quite well, controlling the game, not creating big chances, but controlling the pace of the game.",
      "\"We suffer a lot with throw-ins and set pieces but we already knew our team would struggle against this team, we didn’t have the height necessary for this kind of game. They score twice in these kind of moments, even with Mattha on the floor.",
      "\"And in the second half, I felt we were near the draw and then we suffer a goal and like some other times we disconnect and then another goal three or five minutes later. We pushed forward and tried to score, we scored twice but didn’t have time to do better.\""

      "Mason Mount was critical of Manchester United's failure to beat Brentford in the Premier League on Sunday.",
      "Amorim made eight changes to his starting team to face Brentford and Mount made his first start since returning from injury. Mount opened the scoring in the 14th minute after a superb cross from Alejandro Garnacho, but Brentford responded brilliantly and they led 2-1 by half-time.",
      "Brentford extended their advantage in the second half, with Kevin Schade and Yoane Wissa scoring goals in quick succession to give the home side a 4-1 lead with 17 minutes to play.",
      "But United didn't give up and Garnacho popped up with a stunning goal in the 82nd minute.",
      "Amad then made it 4-3 when he cut inside to score during injury time, although United ran out of time to find an equaliser, meaning they were narrowly defeated at the Gtech Community Stadium.",
      "Although Amorim made multiple changes, Mount was adamant that standards must be higher. \"We need to do better. We need to win this game,\" he told Premier League Productions.",
      "\"We started well but that second half and end of the first half conceding goals where we knew what was coming. We knew they put crosses in the box and we need to defend that better.",
      "\"We can perform better in the game. We still need to perform. There were changes, but it's Manchester United so any team that goes out there that puts on the shirt we need to perform and win games. I know there's a big game on Thursday but first and foremost was today.",
      "\"We needed to win the game but we didn't. It was too late when they scored four.\"",
      "Mount did agree that United showed some personality in the defeat. \"We've shown that before,\" he said. \"We never let the game go until the final whistle but we can't let ourselves get in that position. It's a bit of personality and character but we shouldn't get in that position.\"",
      "He was asked about the Europa Legaue and added: \"It's a massive end to the season. We have a big game on Thursday. It doesn't matter the scoreline. We attack it like it's 0-0. We know what we need to do.",
      "\"We can get into the Champions League next season and that's the most important thing. The season we've had in the Premier League is something we need to look at massively, but if we can get into final and win that it's a positive end to the season.\""

      "Manchester United narrowly lost 4-3 to Brentford on Sunday afternoon.",
      "United put one foot in the final of the Europa League with a polished display against Athletic Bilbao on Thursday night, winning 3-0 thanks to a brace from Bruno Fernandes and a goal from Casemiro.",
      "Despite taking a giant stride towards the final, Ruben Amorim will take nothing for granted, and he opted to rest several big-name players against Brentford. The United starting XI was: Bayindir, Fredricson, Shaw, De Ligt, Amass, Dorgu, Mainoo, Ugarte, Garnacho, Obi, Mount.",
      "United took the lead through Mason Mount, but Brentford responded well and had a 4-1 lead by the 73rd minute. However, United rallied and didn't give up hope of getting a result.",
      "Alejandro Garnacho made it 4-2 with 10 minutes to play and Amad scored during injury time, although United ran out of time for an equaliser and were narrowly defeated in the capital.",
      "Recap what happened at the Gtech Community Stadium here.",
      "Altay Bayindir",
      "Struggled to kick the ball properly and command his area. Made a couple of decent saves at 2-1 but this was further proof he is probably United's third-best goalie. 4",
      "Tyler Fredricson",
      "Started where he left off against Wolves and sent the United fans into raptures with some commanding defending. Brentford did seize on his lack of physique for two goals. 6",
      "Matthijs de Ligt",
      "Went down injured in the move for Brentford's goal and soon made way with an apparently separate issue to the foot injury that recently kept him out. 5",
      "Luke Shaw",
      "Captained United for the first time as their longest-serving starter and wasn't at it. Came off at half-time for Leny Yoro. 4",
      "Patrick Dorgu",
      "Defended dozily at the far post for Schade's headed goal. Only started in the absence of a senior right winger and made way at the pause. 4",

      "That's the final whistle here at the Gtech Stadium.",
      "Mount, Garnacho and Amad with the goals, but United are defeated.",

      "United are looking to put the cat amongst the pigeons with another goal.",
      "Obi just had a shot blocked inside the box.",
      "There have been a few positives to take and it's all about Thursday night for United.",
      "What a stunning goal from Garnacho, who finds the top right corner from the edge of the box.",
      "He cut it on the left, combined with Eriksen and fired into the net.",
      "Wissa wanted a fifth after a defence-splitting pass, but Bayindir rushed out and cleared the ball.",
      "There was a lengthy check for offside by VAR, but the goal was eventually given.",
      "That was far too simple for Brentford and Wissa taps into an empty net after a square pass.",
      "United have collapsed in the last five minutes, but Amorim's name is still being chanted.",
      "Schade scores his second header of the game, which should wrap up the victory for Brentford.",
      "They haven't been at the top of their game today and still have a two-goal advantage.",
      "Amass just fired a shot over the bar and Garnacho had a shot blocked on the edge of the box.",
      "This second half has drifted and it has a bit of an end-of-season feel to it.",
      "Brentford's long throw-ins have caused problems all afternoon and they came close to scoring there, with Wissa looming at the back post after an intelligent flick on header.",
      "Mount replaced by Eriksen, who knows this place well after spending a season with Brentford.",
      "Amad just tried to make something happen by bursting down the right side. United have lacked intensity since falling behind and perhaps the winger can inject some life into them.",
      "Garnacho booked, which is the second yellow card of the game for United.",
      "The ball fell to Mount on the edge of the box, but his shot was tame and easily gathered.",

      "The game sandwiched between their two semi final clashes with Athletic Bilbao was a trip to Brentford. De Ligt started the game at the Gtech Community Stadium having played 25 minutes of the victory over Athletic Bilbao following his return from injury, but his afternoon's work was over after just 35 minutes.",
      "The Dutchman entered into a 50-50 challenge with Yoane Wissa before signalling that he had picked up a knock. He had to be replaced by Harry Maguire and it is unclear whether he will be available for Thursday's semi final second leg.",
      "United were trailing 2-1 at the time of the incident. Mason Mount had put United ahead early on with a cool finish following Alejandro Garnacho's cross.",
      "Read the full story here.",

      "Excellent pass for the goal. 6",

      "Garnacho",
      "Fine cross for the goal. 6",
      "Obi",
      "Out of his depth. 4",
      "That's the whistle for the break here.",
      "Ugarte booked for a cyincal foul - Wissa was away and he pulled him to the ground.",
      "That’s the first time Brentford have properly preyed on Fredricson’s underdeveloped frame and it was some rare good goalkeeping from Bayindir.",
      "United have gone to pot now. We have barely turned our necks left towards the Brentford goal as it has been one-way traffic since Shaw’s own goal. Not many starters are emerging from this half with any credit, at this rate.",
      "Tom Heaton is hard done by not to be playing in this. Apart from two penalty saves at Arsenal, there is no evidence that Bayindir is better than him. Onana was always going to be safe with Bayindir as back-up. He has had an error-strewn half.",
      "Brentford are now playing at the level we have come to expect of them against United at home. They were dormant until that fortuitous equaliser but United have barely attacked since then.",
      "Obi might have a bit of sympathy with Hojlund after his first 38 minutes here. That free-kick from Shaw was an aimless, pointless punt into the corner that basically told a striker ‘chase that’. He never had a chance of getting there. United’s service into him has been diabolical, as it always is with Hojlund. After Shaw took that free-kick Amorim waved his arms in the air to ask ‘what’s that?’. He has a right to expect his players to take better care of the ball.",
      "The bigger issue for United isn’t the goal but the injury to De Ligt. Who would have been a nailed-on starter in a Europa League final but might now be a doubt for that game. All speculative at this stage but he seemed to know he was in trouble immediately. Maguire on for him when he was probably looking forward to a longer rest."

      "There's also the exciting scope of exits that could increase United's transfer kitty. Antony, who scored another goal for Real Betis last night, is attracting interest from Spain with Marcus Rashford also keen on a move away.",
      "With this in mind, keep across all the latest United transfer news in our live blog updates below:",
      "TBR Football report Man United are 'chasing a deal' to sign Bournemouth attacker Antoine Semenyo.",
      "However, they are not alone in their pursuit with Liverpool, Arsenal, Tottenham and Newcastle all credited with an interest. Clubs in the Saudi Pro League are also said to be keeping tabs on his situation.",
      "With a departure likely this summer, the report adds that the Middle East is the 'most likely' destination for the 25-year-old, as things stand.",
      "According to Brazilian outlet UOL, Arsenal are among the clubs to have made an 'enquiry' about winger Antony.",

      "His future at Old Trafford remains uncertain beyond the summer with head coach Ruben Amorim expected to make a decision upon Antony's return to Manchester.",
      "According to Inside Futbol, Man United are looking to activate the buy-back clause to bring Álvaro Carreras back to Old Trafford.",
      "The 22-year-old initially joined Portuguese giants Benfica on loan before making the move permanent last summer. However, United had included a buy-back clause in the deal, valued at €18m (£15m).",
      "That said, Carreras is also drawing attention from Real Madrid, who are reportedly interested in signing the left-back.",

      "If he is fit enough to start on Sunday, it would be no surprise to see him start as the right-sided No.10. After initially operating at wing-back under Amorim, he was moved into a more advanced role to give United a left-footed presence in that area.",
      "With Amad potentially taking the right-sided No.10 spot, Mount could be in line to occupy the opposite berth. He is yet to find any sort of rhythm since recovering from his latest injury, meaning Amorim, who is a huge fan of his, should give him the opportunity to try and flex his muscles against the team he has scored his only United goal against.",
      "Rasmus Hojlund led United's attack in Bilbao and, in Amorim's opinion, had his best game since he replaced Erik ten Hag. He is the club's only available striker for the Europa League amid Joshua Zirkzee's absence through injury and Chido Obi's ineligibility, meaning he should be rested against the Bees.",
      "With that in mind, there has never been a better opportunity for Amorim to give United's fans what they have been waiting for and give Obi his full debut. The talented 17-year-old has made six substitute appearances since making his debut in February, with his last two cameos in the Premier League amounting to 35 minutes.",
      "The youngster has been excellent for the Under-18s this term and has looked sharp when given opportunities from the bench by Amorim, meaning he has worked his way into a position where he is ready to secure his first start in senior football.",
      "The prospect of him leading the line and being supported by Amad and Mount would, of course, mark the birth of a previously unseen United attack, but it would be one worthy of experimenting with with the pressure off.",
      "United supporters are drooling over Obi's potential, while they have also been wowed by Amad's improvements under Amorim. With full focus on the second part of the Europa League semi-final, Amorim can afford to play around this weekend."

All 20 clubs automatically receive around £95m through an equal share distributed based on both the domestic (£31.2m in 2023/24) and international (£55.7m in 2023/24) broadcast deals – those TV rights are lucrative for a reason – as well as £8.2m each from central commercial revenue streams.",

But Leeds will not have regretted their decision as two draws in Europe helped them reach the second group stage, from which they would also advance before a valiant fall in the semi-finals.",

      "Man Utd are closing in on their first summer departure with Atletico Madrid ‘very close to completing a move’ for Antony, according to reports.",
      "The Red Devils allowed the Brazil international to leave Old Trafford and move to Real Betis on loan until the end of the season in the winter transfer window.",
      "Man Utd spent around £87m on Antony in the summer of 2022 but he made very little impact in his two-and-a-half seasons at Old Trafford.",
      "Antony contributed just five Premier League goals and three assists in 62 appearances with the 25-year-old making no league starts this season before the Red Devils offloaded him to Betis.",
      "But the Brazilian has been impressing in La Liga with the winger contributing six goals and two assists in 19 matches in all competitions for the Spanish outfit.",
      "Real Betis have been keen to make the move permanent in summer with Man Utd hoping to permanently remove him from their books.",
      "And now reports in Spain claim that Atletico Madrid are ‘very close to completing a move’ for Antony with the Spanish understood to have ‘submitted a €40 million offer to Manchester United to secure his services.’",
      "Real Betis ‘hoped to negotiate a permanent purchase at the end of the season’ but rivals Atletico Madrid ‘has preemptively made a compelling offer that has convinced United’.",
      "Atletico have been ‘monitoring the Brazilian player’s progress for weeks’ and manager Diego Simeone is ‘convinced that Antony can provide the speed and directness his team needs to make a competitive leap forward in both LaLiga and the Champions League’.",
      "The report adds:",
      "‘The 40 million euro offer from the Red and Whites, presented in the last few hours, has been welcomed by Manchester United, who are willing to part with the player for a sum that allows them to recoup part of the initial investment made when they signed him from Ajax. The deal, in financial terms, is very close to being finalized, and talks are expected to progress rapidly in the coming weeks.’",
      "Real Betis are ‘unable to compete financially with Atletico’s financial muscle’ and the Verdiblancos had hoped their ‘good relationship with the player and with the United team could facilitate a more affordable negotiation’.",
      "And now it looks likely that Atletico Madrid will complete a ‘luxury addition’ for next season and the potential signing of Antony ‘could be one of the first major moves of what promises to be a busy summer at the Metropolitano headquarters’.",
      "Former Man Utd assistant manager Rene Meulensteen recently advised Antony to stay at Real Betis as he “has no future” at Old Trafford.",
      "Meulensteen said: “Antony has no future at Manchester United. If I was him, I’d stay at Real Betis, without a doubt. He’s never really lived up to the expectations or the price tag at United, but he’s found his feet in Spain. He seems to be a lot happier playing football and in life generally at Betis – which is the most important thing.",
      "“If he returned to Manchester, he’d fall straight back into the rut he was in before he left, which wouldn’t be good for anybody. I can’t see him returning under any circumstance; it’s probably best for all parties that he joins Betis on a permanent deal.”",
      "Manchester United boss Ruben Amorim is eyeing two Real Betis players as the Red Devils ‘propose a swap deal’ in a £25.5m ‘discount’ for Antony.",
      "Man Utd are hoping to include a Real Betis player in any deal they strike for Antony in the summer transfer window, according to reports.",
      "Man Utd plan on spending the money they receive from Atletico Madrid for Antony on Borussia Dortmund star Jamie Gittens, according to reports.",
      "According to reports, Manchester United have ‘received’ a huge offer to sell Brazil international Antony with his form for Real Betis ‘not going unnoticed’.",
      "Arsenal are hopeful that they can get a deal for Man Utd flop Antony wrapped up ‘as soon as possible’, according to reports.",
      "Man Utd are ‘confident’ that they will find a buyer willing to pay £40m for Antony in the summer transfer window, according to reports."

      "Arteta and Art class…\nHaving attended Art class, I found Andy H, Swansea’s entry fairly persuasive, but I have to reject one of his premises, i.e., that Arsenal were a “pratfalling mess” when Mikel Arteta arrived.",
      "I think that Andy’s assessment of Arteta’s performance is reasonably fair in itself, but Arsene Wenger’s final league finish was sixth, not fourteenth or seventeenth. A team finishing sixth in any EPL season is hardly a team doing pratfalls. They were a club with a legendary manager who led the Invincibles and transformed English football…which, in return, grew beyond him.",
      "They had plenty of talent when Arteta arrived, if some of it had been misused. They were in no sense a mess; they just needed a new coach. Maybe they needed one a couple of years earlier, but I don’t really know, as I’m not Stewie Griffin*. Arteta has improved them, no doubt, but he hardly applied CPR.",
      "I deleted a whole nostalgic paragraph about having driven for two and a half hours to see Newcastle lose an FA Cup final and Why I Don’t Hate Arsenal, but I was only belabouring things.",
      "On the other hand, five and a half years of watching Mikel Arteta at Arsenal have taught me to detest Mikel Arteta at Arsenal. I have Mailbox form here, as it were, and won’t belabour my beef either, though I will repeat that I always liked him as a player.",
      "But the fact remains that, whatever his failings, Arteta is at the very least a good coach who can really nail it against an opponent like Real Madrid once in a while. He has beaten a lot of good coaches, whatever his transfer market failures. If I were an Arsenal supporter, I think I’d be ambivalent. The wrong upgrade could be disastrous.",
      "Perhaps handing over a bit of transfer control would benefit him. Maybe he should be telling the board and Director what he wants, not who he wants, and let the scouts, the stattos and Edu go find it.",
      "All that said, my club’s won exactly one real pot in my 30 years of support, and it still feels like yesterday. Fans of some clubs think it’s an utter shambles, a travesty of justice, the end of the world when their club don’t win at least one trophy in any given season. It’s beyond me. My expectations just aren’t calibrated the way “big club” supporters I read here or in the socials.",
      "And no offense to those Gunners, but I hope they never will be. It seems to steal a lot of joy. My philosophy has always been that losing is part of sport; if you don’t know losing, what do you really know? (Besides winning, obvs.)",
      "Also, I don’t mind the Saudis trickling a little gratification on my head as they go about their ugly enterprises, but it would be a shame if it bought them anything approaching dominance.\nChris C, Toon Army DC (*I could be wrong.

      "",
      "I am oft surprised, disappointed and frustrated in the criticism Arteta receives – some of it very personal – hidden behind smokescreens of “he hasn’t/won’t win anything”.",
      "Personally, I look at last season where Arteta’s Arsenal turned in their best league points (and GD?) second only to the Invincibles. That’s pretty good, Man City were very slightly better over 38 games so they won the league. We all know Man City have been an unprecedented level of dominance in the league since well before Arteta joined Arsenal for various sporting reasons – even ignoring the 115 stuff they are strongest club by far.",
      "This season has not gone as well, not just for Arsenal but for quite a few other “big” clubs. Despite all our “Shitness”, we are still the second best team in the league and I think that gets under some folk’s skin.",
      "Anyway, regarding not winning anything – here is the exhaustive list of managers who have won competitions Arteta has not. I am excluding domestic cups and European competitions apart from the Champions League because they don’t count in these conversations. Winning an FA Cup would not change people’s position – “ah but he can’t win the league” etc…besides, just ask Ten Hag or David Moyes whether these comps are enough to keep your job on their own. Critics like to tout the cups as a stick to beat Arteta but would not allow winning them as a defense. They are very nice though but small beer apparently – so onwards!",

And Carlo Ancelotti, beaten home & away this season. I have two thoughts from this\n1. Alex Ferguson took 7 years to win his first title",
      "2. Are people biased?",
      "Here’s a test for people who think Arteta should be sacked for underperformance. Imagine Arsenal have had exactly the same results since 2019 but instead of Arteta being manager, it is James Milner (or Aaron Ramsey). Would you lay your vitriol at his feet, spit in his face? Or would he require more support, bigger investment, more time, more luck. If not, think about that.\nGuru",

      "Rio Ferdinand\nI don’t really like Rio Ferdinand on comms, for many reasons but you can’t question his talent as footballer. An absolute Rolls Royce of a defender. He played alongside Vidic? Yep, and they complemented each other perfectly. Rio was the best centre back of the noughties in the Premier League (lots of fashionable foreign defenders then too). Better on the ball and still less of a bellend than John Terry. He’d be equally lauded today as then if he was playing now. Ball playing centre backs are not a modern phenomenon either (Bobby Moore?). If I didn’t support United I’d say Van Dijk was better (almost as if you combined Vidic and Rio) but I do so I’ll stick by my man.",
      "I also completely agree with J. Nicholson about the embarrassment of United and Spurs pissing the Europa League. But it’s UEFA that should be embarrassed. It all started when they let runners up join the Champions League (literally adding losers ruins the name a bit). What we have now is a European Super League by stealth supported by two lesser European competitions which act as a safety net for teams like United who struggle to qualify the proper way. Much like VAR, we can never go back.",
      "And finally, there is so much nuance to some of the issues that are constantly debated in these hallowed pages and that affect our wonderful game. That nuance is above the heads of at least 50% of people that we end up in situations where trans people have nowhere to play football (or any sport really) and a young(ish) black woman loses her job for “clumsy” comments about an important issue. Aluko was wrong about Wright (I think) but the men’s game has been hostile to women (it was men that banned it for fifty years so fight me) and there is a representational imbalance which has been ignored in the fallout.\nAshmundo",
      "",
      "Let’s get this out of the way first; Rio is an absolutely diabolical pundit/co-commentator. I actually muttered “f**k’s sake…” when they announced he’d “made his way up to the gantry” 2 minutes into the game last night.",
      "However, Hartley in the Mailbox needs to go and wash his mouth out with soap and water for questioning him as a player. I’ve seen lots of great centre backs at United, from Bruce and Pallister, to Stam and Johnsen and then Vidic and Rio. Rio was the best of the lot and it’s not particularly close. Tall, quick, strong, great on the ball; I’d argue he’s the best centre back in Premier League history. Unfortunately, he became injury prone around 30 which is when centre halves often get the most plaudits.",
      "I’d argue he’s criminally underrated, and any United fan that knows their onions will tell you Rio covered up for Vidic, not the other way round. Vidic got mountains of praise because he’d throw himself in front of anything and came across as a warrior for the fans. That’s why he was loved. Rio did “merks” and missed drug tests, and generally came across as a bit of a knob.",
      "As was referenced elsewhere in the mailbox, likability is a really important factor in shaping public opinion, and no one really likes Rio, myself included, but you need to separate the man from the player. He was an absolutely top tier defender. See also, Terry, John.\nLewis, Busby Way",

      "Harry Maguire \nHarry Maguire. This man has been run through the mill.",
      "For quite a few years, he was (and still often is) lambasted in the press/social media.",
      "He has made one mistake along this whole way, and that was the Greece debacle. No one knows what actually happened other than those actually present, so its hard to give a view either way. Perhaps best to say he might have been better off getting away from it all before it kicked off, but who knows. Alcohol and youth often exacerbate things, I certainly cant throw stones from my glass house on that one.",
      "From a football perspective, he’s played the game as best he can. He can’t do any more than that. People slag him for being slow ….. well that’s just him, it’s not his fault – some guy paying £80m for you doesn’t suddenly make you run faster. But – he’s given it his all every time he steps on the pitch. He’s faced the criticism head-on and come back stronger, accepting his weaknesses. He’s accepted a new system under this new manager, knuckled down and got on with it. And for that, I tip my hat and say well played, kudos to him. Seeing him score the winner against Lyon, and then dicking all over the Bilbao fullback like a top end winger was a pleasure, and I couldnt be happier for the guy. If half the Man Utd squad had the bollocks and spine that he had, the club would be in a far better position than it currently is.",
      "A little aside on Hartley MCFC. I agree Rio is by no means the greatest commentator/pundit in the modern game. But to use that as a reason to start questioning his ability as a footballer during his career, is a little ridiculous, no? I mean, Sir Alex Ferguson, one of the greatest managers of all time, saw fit to go and get him and make him the heart of his defence for 12 years.

      "Manchester United legend Gary Pallister has suggested that Ruben Amorim should consider dropping a Europa League hero as he may not be the out-and-out best player in any position he’s capable of playing.",
      "Amorim has at his disposal seven centre-backs at United. Currently, Jonny Evans and Victor Lindelof are in addition to Harry Maguire, Lisandro Martinez, Ayden Heaven, Matthijs de Ligt and Leny Yoro.",
      "However, the former pair are set to move on for free in the summer – Evans’ departure has been confirmed – so that drops the number to five.",
      "Of those five, Red Devils legend Pallister feel two walk into the side for next season, and Maguire, though in sumptuous form at the moment, is not one of them.",
      "“I’d play Lisandro Martinez as the left-sided centre-back. I would play Leny Yoro as the right-sided centre-back as he has got the pace to cover in the wide areas, and then Amorim has got a decision to make whether it will be Harry Maguire or Matthijs de Ligt,” Pallister told GIVEMESPORT.",
      "“I think they’re both more attuned to playing in the middle of the three, because I don’t think they’re blessed with great pace, but they read the game really well, and they’re confident on the ball.",
      "“I would choose from either of them two, and then I think it’s about getting your wing-backs sorted as well. Patrick Dorgu has had an alright start and Diogo Dalot has been there for a number of years and does a good job there.”",
      "At present, it would seem harsh to rip Maguire out of the side. He has had to work very hard to get his game back in a good place, after being stripped of the captaincy by former boss Erik ten Hag and regularly being left on the bench by the Dutchman.",
      "Maguire has been particularly heroic in the Europa League campaign this season. United were minutes from being dumped out by Lyon in the quarter-finals, but a Maguire header completed a fantastic comeback in a 7-6 aggregate win.",
      "He had earlier assisted United’s second goal in the second leg. In the first leg of the semi-final, the defender showed his qualities as a winger, skinning a defender twice before placing an inch perfect cross on Manuel Ugarte’s head, who glanced it across to Casemiro for the opening goal.",
      "United won that game 3-0, and Maguire helped to set the tone. His rebirth up top has been such that we believe he could rival Rasmus Hojlund for a spot there – that would end discourse about him being dropped at the back!",
      "Arsenal risk a ‘disaster’ if they sack Mikel Arteta, while two ‘worries’ for Manchester United remain after their ‘brilliance’ vs Athletic Bilbao.",
      "Harry Maguire was the hero against Lyon while Rasmus Hojlund did sweet f-all once again. Here are ten reasons Amorim should start the centre-back up top for Man Utd.",
      "Man Utd defender Harry Maguire called out ‘inconsistent’ performances during a ‘disappointing’ season as the club prepare to face Lyon in the Europa League.",
      "Manchester United will be without defender Matthijs de Ligt for the visit of Manchester City on Sunday.",
      "Manchester United head coach Ruben Amorim has provided an injury update, with two of his players “ready” to return against Nottingham Forest.",
      "Manchester United legend Gary Pallister has hit out at Mikel Arteta for storming out of an interview after Arsenal drew 1-1 with the Red Devils on Sunday."

      "Manchester United have reportedly moved ‘one step closer’ to being able to land a ‘serious target’ for the midfield, and are ‘confident’ of the price they’ll have to pay.",
      "United have had a woeful time of it in the Premier League this season. They’re 14th in the league, having won just 10 of their 34 games so far.",
      "But in Europe, things are heating up for the Red Devils. They were about six minutes away from being dumped out of the Europa League in the quarter-finals when Lyon were 6-4 up on aggregate, before Bruno Fernandes, Kobbie Mainoo and Harry Maguire turned the game on its head in the final few minutes.",
      "Indeed, they won 7-6 on aggregate in stoppage time, reaching the semis, where they thumped Athletic Club 3-0 in the first leg, putting themselves in a strong position to reach the final. United’s advancement in Europe will only help them in terms of transfers.",
      "According to GIVEMESPORT, they have ‘moved one step closer’ to the signing of Atalanta midfielder Ederson ‘thanks to having one foot’ in the Europa League final.",
      "Indeed, winning the competition would ‘put them in a better position to meet Atalanta’s financial demands’. The winners of the Europa League will get a boost of around £11million, and the runners-up around £6million, which would help towards any signings.",
      "Ederson is said to be a ‘serious target’, and he’s about to enter the final two years of his deal. United know the lack of a financial boost would hinder their attempts to sign him, but they are ‘confident’ he can be secured for below £50million.",
      "As such, the Red Devils could potentially pay more than a fifth of the transfer fee with money they don’t currently have, but will have earned if they win the Europa League.",
      "It is also believed the midfielder – who played in nine Champions League games this season – is ‘more likely to have his head turned’ by the prospect of an Old Trafford move if they gain a spot in the elite European competition. That would be the case if they won the Europa League.",
      "There is said to be a desire from United to enter negotiations over the transfer in the coming months, and silverware could be the catalyst."

      "“In the end. That a few basic things need to be changed and since then 700 or if not £750m has been spent on new players. And in the table they are even significantly worse than back then,” he told Canal + Austria.",
      "“They could actually, with a win in the Europa League, still save this season. Because then they will be in the Champions League.",
      "“Everything else would be a disappointment, and it will be interesting to see what will happen. They have signed a coach in the middle of the season who plays with a three or a five-back, and the squad was built based on a four-back system.",
      "“This is what you see when you see them play, especially in Premier League games against the opponents against which Manchester United normally has to win.",
      "“Sure, in the Europa League, they have – usually with the result against Lyon, you are eliminated – they have turned it around. And of course, the stadium had a huge effect.”",
      "In the summer window prior to the 2024/25 season, United splashed around £180million, and followed that up with a spend of another £25million or so in the January window, Ruben Amorim’s first since taking over from Erik ten Hag.",
      "But they have been in the bottom half of the Premier League for almost the entire season, currently sitting 14th. The end of Rangnick’s season at the helm saw United finish sixth, which was only the third time they’d finished that low in eight years.",
      "While the Austrian’s spell at the club was not a particularly good one, things have clearly gone from bad to worse.",
      "United have been linked with some big names in the summer, and they’ll need some of those signings to get back to competing in the top half of the league."

      "Amorim’s side are already guaranteed to go down as the worst Man Utd side to have played in the Premier League era, even if they win their final four matches.",

      "Despite Barcelona’s ‘fragile financial situation’, Joan Laporta is staying strong on his asking price with Man Utd now knowing what it will take to ‘close the deal’.",

      "Manchester United boss Ruben Amorim has put a hugely limiting restriction on the players he wants the club to sign this summer, adding to the already ‘strict rules’ put in place by Sir Jim Ratcliffe and INEOS ahead of the major squad surgery required to prevent the Red Devils from further embarrassing themselves next season.",
      "Here are five players who ‘won’t come’ to United this summer on the basis of this new rule set out by Amorim and the five which worked perfectly for them in Ratcliffe’s first window with his hand on the tiller.",
      "",
      "Viktor Gyokeres\n“I didn’t talk to him,” Ruben Amorim said when asked about United’s links with Gyokeres.”But if a player only wants to come to Man United to play Champions League, then he won’t come. We want players who want to represent United, not players who want to play certain competitions.”",
      "We don’t know whether Amorim believes United should be exempt from the key factor which has governed which clubs top players choose to sign for over the last two decades, but if he thinks Gyokeres is somehow abnormal for wanting to play Champions League football then he’s gravely mistaken. He’s the most deadly goalscorer in Europe.",
      "It would be great if the strength and veracity of this Amorim belief could be put to the test with a phone call to Gyokeres before and after United win the Europa League final and gain entry into the Champions League next season, with the striker’s flip-flop met with contempt and a snub by his former manager in favour of a much worse striker who wanted to join no matter what.",
      "",
      "Jonathan Tah\nWith all due respect to our wonderful news editor and headline whizz Joe Williams, we’re not sure many Manchester United fans will have clicked on a link with any hope of the Red Devils pulling off the signing of Tah having read ‘Man Utd ‘actively consider’ free transfer ahead of Bayern Munich, Real Madrid and Barcelona’.",
      "You can ‘consider’ as much as you want, lads. That’s a four-club battle you’re not winning. Nor should they be battling in the first place. Free transfer or not, the Germany international breaks the primary golden rule set out by INEOS of not signing players over the age of 25. He’s 29 until he’s 30 in February.",
      "",
      "Patrick Schick\n‘The manager will be asked what position he wants to sign, not what player,’ the rules report claimed, and Amorim has flouted not just that directive but another by suggesting they sign 29-year-old Schick.",
      "Amorim has had the gall to ask whether the United bosses would be willing to ‘go against their transfer strategy’ to sign the Bayer Leverkusen striker as an alternative should they miss out on Liam Delap, rather than waiting for his list of three strikers to choose from, passed down from the recruitment geniuses who bought a striker last summer who’s scored seven goals in 48 appearances.",
      "",
      "Victor Osimhen\nA triple whammy of rule breaks here we suspect. Sir Jim Ratcliffe said he didn’t want any ‘Galacticos’, making quite the assumption that Manchester United still have the clout to sign such players. But then again, a sojourn in the Turkish league (no disrespect) may have given United cause to believe Osimhen – whom we reckon can just about be classed as a ‘Galactico’ – would be open to a move to Old Trafford.",
      "But they don’t want those top tier stars, likely because of their wage demands as much as anything, with some reports suggesting Osimhen wants as much as £400,000 per week from his next club. He’s also 26 and surely has designs on Champions League football.",
      "",
      "Matheus Cunha\nWe can’t wait for the look on their faces when they realise 25-year-old ‘done deal’ Cunha turns 26 five days before the transfer window opens.",
      "Ruben Amorim named the youngest Manchester United starting XI in Premier League history to prepare for a crucial European game. How mid-2000s of him.",
      "Man Utd will make an offer to bring Barcelona defender Ronald Araujo to Old Trafford if they qualify for the Champions League, according to reports.",
      "Man Utd boss Ruben Amorim has revealed that Patrick Dorgu and Manuel Ugarte were “nervous” before their Europa League clash against Athletic Bilbao.",
      "Arsenal are leading the race for Manchester United-linked Sporting CP striker Viktor Gyokeres, according to reports in Portugal.",
      "Ruben Amorim was asked a question which he answered while Liverpool are also pulled into the narrative as Federico Chiesa involved…",

      "“You could feel it especially in the players, players like Ugarte, who has a lot of experience, he was a little bit nervous. Patrick was a little bit nervous. This is a semi-final, not a Champions League semi-final but a big final.",
      "“But these kind of players, Harry, Casemiro, Bruno Fernandes, they help us a lot.”",
      "Despite the three-goal lead heading into the second leg, Amorim insists the tie is not over: “I think the result is really good but we have to understand the result also, at the same time. We struggled a lot in the beginning, but the goal from Casemiro and the sending off changed the game.",
      "“But that is a good thing, with a little bit of luck we managed to stay in the game and anything can change with one situation. I think we had opportunities to score one more. This is not done.",

      "Maguire saved one of his best performances of the season for Bilbao and Amorim was impressed by the Man Utd centre-back, he added: “Sometimes you have these moments in your life, when everything he did was bad for him.",
      "“I don’t know a better word to describe it. Now everything he does is helping the team win important matches, so he needs to enjoy it and the players need to understand the life of a footballer is like that and everything can change in one moment.”",
      "Man Utd boss Amorim insists rotation will now be key, he continued: “Of course, we are in the advantage, we have our fans, but again this could change. Anything can happen in one game. Of course, we are confident but we need to be really careful with our players against Brentford, because you can feel it. Nous Mazraoui is dead [tired], Patrick is tired, so we have to manage the players.”",
      "When asked why Man Utd are so good in Europe compared to the Premier League, Amorim replied: “There is something in life and in sport: luck.",
      "“We suffered some goals in the Premier League sometimes and we start the game losing 1-0 and then it’s really hard. In the Europa League we had some luck this year in the key moments and then we play well.”",

      "The 3-1 defeat at Chelsea will do little to trouble Liverpool as they celebrated their deserved title. But if anyone was questioning what Arne Slot's side may have looked like with a few injuries, then that performance was it.",
      "There were probably some party-related reasons for Liverpool's flat performance and a lower intensity than normal, but Arne Slot wanted to use these final four games to help him plan for the summer. Those he brought into the team at Stamford Bridge failed to impress.",
      "The entire midfield was changed and the trio of Wataru Endo, Curtis Jones and Harvey Elliott could not cope with their Chelsea counterparts, notably Romeo Lavia and Cole Palmer who ran the show.",
      "Jones slipped in the build-up to Chelsea's first, Elliott was hauled off after the Blues' second - and Endo showed he, at 32, will struggle to replicate what Ryan Gravenberch did brilliantly all season.",
      "At the top end of the pitch, Diogo Jota was anonymous with just 13 touches - he has one league goal in 2025 - while Darwin Nunez missed two good openings after coming on. At least he managed one more touch than Jota.",
      "None had a worse outing though than Jarell Quansah, with one own goal and one penalty conceded in a disappointing and unconvincing display at centre-half, one that was reminiscent of his opening-day struggles at Ipswich.",
      "Liverpool will not stand still this summer and rest on their laurels. The club want to be busy in the transfer market and strengthen their squad to compete again next season and develop the next title-winning team.",
      "And with Kostas Tsimikas failing to ease Liverpool's left-back woes, that looks like four areas Liverpool could strengthen this summer. Left-back, centre-back, midfield and striker - and don't forget a right-back if Trent Alexander-Arnold departs, as expected.Sam Blitz",
      "Bilbao or bust has been the mantra at Manchester United for some time. Watching them fall to a 16th league defeat of the season as they lost 4-3 at Brentford, their most for 35 years, made that abundantly clear. But there is something more behind their struggles.",
      "Ruben Amorim named the third-youngest team in Premier League history at Brentford. Considering United's recent domestic form, and the eight changes made after Thursday's win over Athletic Club, defeat was almost inevitable, strange as that sounds.",
      "Everything, understandably, is focused on the Europa League. That doesn't answer the question of why United, the only undefeated side in European competition, haven't beaten a team that will be playing top-flight football next season since January 26.",
      "Since that 1-0 win at Fulham, sealed thanks to Lisandro Martinez's deflected strike, United have played 10 teams outside the bottom three and failed to win against any of them. They still had a round left of the Europa League league phase after that win.",
      "Meanwhile, in Europe United have overcome Real Sociedad and Lyon. Barring a shock collapse, not something you would put past this group, you can add Athletic Club to that list. Then they are one game from a European trophy. Puzzling.",
      "The defeat at Brentford, although not the fairest game to draw conclusions from, served up a perfect example of the problems plaguing Amorim in the Premier League: United were simply unable to cope with Brentford's physicality, pace and direct football.",
      "Regardless of who was picked, as this season has shown us, those same vulnerabilities would remain.",
      "Amorim has inherited a squad ill-equipped to cope with the rigours of English football. Those squad-building missteps must be corrected this summer, particularly if Champions League qualification is secured, otherwise Amorim will see no improvement.Zinny Boswell",
      "Alexander Isak must have felt like his moment would never come in Newcastle's 1-1 draw at Brighton. Twice he had picked up the ball thinking he was about to have a free shot at goal from 12 yards after referee Craig Pawson had pointed to the spot. VAR ruined Newcastle's fun by spotting two incorrect calls from Pawson so it was looking like one of those days for Isak and his team.",
      "But one more chance would come on 89 minutes when Pawson finally correctly spotted a legitimate penalty and Isak was in no mood to pass it up.",
      "In scoring he became the first Newcastle United player to score 23 goals in a Premier League season since Alan Shearer in 2002 and now has 22 goals in his last 26 league appearances. There is still time to catch Mohamed Salah in the Golden Boot race, too. He is five back with three games to play and Salah has only scored once in his last six Premier League games. Stranger things have happened.Lewis Jones",
      "There have been calls from some sections of the Brighton fans for goalkeeper Bart Verbruggen to be replaced.",
      "Before the 1-1 draw with Newcastle, the Seagulls had conceded at least twice in each of their last six Premier League games and shipped 24 goals in their previous 11 league encounters. Verbruggen was not solely to blame but his lack of confidence and authority has not been helping his defenders. Brighton also have the worst save ratio in the Premier League this season (59.6 per cent).",
      "However, Verbruggen put in his best performance of 2025 to repel Newcastle. Solid from set-pieces and looking much more composed under pressure, Verbruggen made four saves - the pick of which came in stoppage time to deny Callum Wilson a winning goal. If he can stay in this kind of form, Brighton's defensive process and numbers should be back on the improve.Lewis Jones",
      "Ange Postecoglou's wholesale changes in Tottenham's 1-1 draw at West Ham allowed those brought in to put forward their case to start in Thursday's Europa League semi-final second leg at Bodo/Glimt - and Mathys Tel took it.",
      "The French forward was Spurs' most dangerous player at the London Stadium as he assisted Wilson Odobert's opener after pressing West Ham defender Max Kilman into a mistake.",
      "Tel attempted eight dribbles - the most of any player in the game - and had two shots, with only Jarrod Bowen having more.",
      "It was another promising display from the on-loan Bayern Munich man, who is finding his feet out on the left wing for Spurs, with Postecoglou praising the 20-year-old in his post-match press conference.",
      "He said: \"He's taken in the information and he understands the role now a little bit better, especially out on the left.",
      "\"These last few weeks, we've obviously had Sonny [Heung-Min Son] out. We've needed him to fill that void and I think he's done that job well.\"",
      "If Tel were to start in Norway on Thursday, then it would be well deserved. And with more performances like this, Spurs will be keen to activate the £45m option to sign him permanently from Bayern.Declan Olley",
      "It took Michael Kayode just under three months to make his first start for Brentford after joining on loan from Fiorentina in January. Before then, there were fleeting glimpses of what he had to offer; eye-catching cameos that provided a taste of what was to come.",
      "But he has started at right-back in the Bees' last three games and been a key part of the team that has won three in a row for the first time since a run between October 21 and November 4 2023.",
      "The 20-year-old looked eager to get forward from the very start during Man Utd's visit to the Gtech and his boundless energy caused Amorim's side problems - as did his monstrous throw-ins, as shown in the lead-up to Luke Shaw's own goal.",
      "Kayode completed the most dribbles (5) in the match, won the most duels (10) and finished with a 97 per cent pass accuracy, the most of any player to play 45 minutes or more. \"He looked like he just enjoyed playing football,\" said Thomas Frank afterwards.",
      "There is surely no doubt Brentford will take up the option to make Kayode's stay in west London permanent at the end of the season.Dan Long",
      "If ever there was to be a day when things finally clicked into place for West Ham under Graham Potter, the visit of rivals Tottenham to the London Stadium was surely it.",
      "The Hammers had a week to prepare for the London derby, a luxury compared to Spurs' 64-hour turnaround from Thursday's Europa League semi-final against Bodo-Glimt.",
      "Spurs had more than an eye on Thursday's return leg in Norway, Postecoglou's eight pre-match alterations made that clear, so opportunity knocked for Potter's beleaguered Hammers to end a seven-game wait for a victory.",
      "Before a ball had been kicked, frustration summed up the mood among a fanbase who had not seen a victory since late February, but that turned to apathy come full-time.",
      "Hoards headed for an early exit despite the scoreboard reading 1-1 with the prospect of a late derby victory still on the table.",
      "The fact that was not enough to keep sections of the disgruntled fanbase in their seats shows just how deep West Ham's rut is with three games left to salvage something from this season.Jack Wilkinson"

      "Amorim, who made eight changes and named the third-youngest side in Premier League history, was prioritising Thursday's Europa League semi-final second leg against Athletic Club, with United 3-0 up on aggregate.",
      "Since Amorim took charge of United on November 11, only the now-relegated sides Ipswich (3), Leicester (3), and Southampton (1) have won fewer Premier League games than United (6).",
      "United will be playing Champions League football next season if they can win the Europa League, but Amorim says that is a \"real dilemma\" for the club.",
      "\"We know that, but we need to win, and we need to fight to win this competition, to give something to our fans, and to go to the Champions League.",

      "United were trailing 4-1 with eight minutes to go at Brentford, but late goals from Alejandro Garnacho and substitute Amad Diallo restored some respectability for Amorim's struggling side.",
      "There were flashes of promise, particularly Mason Mount's opener, his first league goal for 13 months, but the performance, for the most part, stood in stark contrast to Thursday's impressive 3-0 win over Athletic Club.",
      "Amorim has failed to translate United's Europa League form into consistent performances and results in the Premier League, but insists he is seeing signs of progress.",
      "He added: \"I have no doubts that we are playing better, and we are understanding the way we play, even in this context. So, we have to take all the hits.",
      "\"We are losing games in the Premier League, we are fighting for the Europa League, so we need to accept that and to think about Thursday as the most important game for us.\"",
      "Asked about the goal for Mount, who has endured another season blighted by injuries, Amorim added: \"It's not just the finish, it's the position that he has on the pitch. He's like a third midfielder that can reach the box. He's really intelligent.",
      "\"He's getting there and he trains really hard. Sometimes I have to push him back and to take him off the pitch because he wants to do so much more. We are taking care of him.",
      "\"He wants to play more minutes, but the minutes were controlled. I'm really happy with him.\"",
      "Striker Chido Obi became the youngest player in United's history to start a Premier League game at Brentford, aged 17 years and 156 days, as fellow academy graduates Harry Amass and Tyler Fredricson also got the nod.",
      "Amorim was pleased with the young trio and the experience they gained, but sent a clear message to them that United's standards in their worst season in the Premier League era would not be accepted moving forward.",
      "\"It is really important to understand that we cannot do this anymore,\" he said, when asked about how important it was for the young players to learn from the defeat.",
      "\"We know the context, but this kind of season we need to change. They need to understand what it is to play for Manchester United.",
      "\"I think they did really well. They [have] not [been] playing so much, but then they have to play 90 minutes because we have to change some other players to save them for Thursday.\"",
      "Asked about the experience they would have gained, Amorim: \"It's really important because you can train a lot with the first team, but to have that feeling, playing with the players, feeling the players, the speed of the game, I think it is the best thing.\"",
      "Obi, on his first senior start, was tasked with leading the line against Brentford's physical centre-back pairing of Nathan Collins and Sepp van den Berg, whose last-minute block denied a goalbound strike from the teenage striker.",
      "The Denmark U21 international had a frustrating full debut until that moment, when he burst through a challenge in the box, and looked destined to at least test Brentford goalkeeper Mark Flekken but for Van den Berg's intervention.",

      "Brentford increased their hopes of qualifying for Europe for the first time as they beat a much-changed Manchester United 4-3 in a thriller at the Gtech.",
      "Conversely, it was Man Utd's 16th league defeat of the season, their most since the 1989/90 season, when they also lost 16.",
      "Since Ruben Amorim took charge on November 11, only the now-relegated sides Ipswich (3), Leicester (3), and Southampton (1) have won fewer Premier League games than United (6).",
      "After United won the first leg of their Europa League semi-final 3-0 against Athletic Club on Thursday, Amorim rung the changes and named the third-youngest starting XI in Premier League history.",
      "Sensing an opportunity as a result, Brentford pressed high from the off and should have been ahead when a Luke Shaw and Altay Bayindir mix-up led to the former almost heading past his own goalkeeper.",
      "Brentford:  Flekken (6), Kayode (8), Collins (6), Van den Berg (6), Lewis-Potter (6), Norgaard (7), Yarmoliuk (7), Mbeumo (7), Damsgaard (7), Schade (9), Wissa (8).\n\n\nSubs:  Jensen (6), Henry (6), Ajer (n/a), Nunes (n/a), Thiago (n/a).\n\n\nMan Utd:  Bayindir (6), Fredricson (5), De Ligt (6), Shaw (4), Dorgu (5), Ugarte (7), Mainoo (6), Amass (6), Mount (7), Garnacho (8), Obi (5).\n\n\nSubs used:  Maguire (6), Yoro (6), Diallo (7), Eriksen (7), Lindelof (6).\n\n\nPlayer of the match:  Kevin Schade.",
      "There was a brief boost when Mason Mount slid Alejandro Garnacho's cross home against the run of play, but the Bees deservedly levelled when Mikkel Damsgaard poked a shot that hit the unfortunate Shaw, then Bayindir, then the net.",
      "Within five minutes, the turnaround was complete. Man Utd switched off, wanting play to be paused when Matthijs de Ligt went down with a leg injury after a tangle with Yoane Wissa, but referee Anthony Taylor played on, so Christian Norgaard was able to pick out Kevin Schade to head home.",
      "Only a last-ditch save from Bayindir to keep out Norgaard's connection on Damsgaard's free-kick prevented it becoming three before the break.",
      "United started the second half well, but found themselves further behind when Schade headed in a peach of a cross from Bryan Mbeumo, before the impressive Michael Kayode squared for Wissa to roll home and make it 4-1, with the goal confirmed after a VAR review.",
      "Garnacho hit a stunner from the edge of the box, before Amad's strike deflected off Sepp van den Berg to make it 4-3 and set up a tense finale, but Brentford held on for their third win in succession as their positive end to the campaign continues.",
      "Brentford head coach Thomas Frank:",
      "\"Basically, from the first year in the division, we respect everyone but fear no one. We believe that we can win every game.",
      "\"We try to go for that win. Sometimes we win, sometimes we lose, but we really, really, really believe it every single time. The players are fantastic. It is a fantastic group to work with.",
      "\"We spoke about it [Europe] before the Brighton game. I rarely say that to the players as it's more about performance, but [I said] this game, we need to win. We have to win this if we want to be in with any chance of maybe having a dream about Europe. And the players did that, big credit to them.",
      "\"Then we played a difficult away game to Nottingham Forest, beat them, home to Man Utd, beat them. And all three wins, well deserved.",
      "\"We've got this momentum, hopefully we can keep it up. It's all about getting the job done and it's one at a time. We had a laser, laser, laser focus throughout four seasons on the next game. It's all about the next game.\"",
      "Man Utd head coach Ruben Amorim:",
      "\"I think it reflected our season. We started quite well, controlling the game, not creating big chances but controlling the pace of the game. We suffered a lot with the throw-ins and set-pieces but we already knew that our team would struggle against this team.",
      "\"We didn't have the height necessary for this kind of game. They scored twice in this kind of moments, even with De Ligt on the floor.",
      "\"And then in the second half I felt that we were near the draw and then we suffered a goal and like some other times we disconnected. And then another goal, almost three minutes, five minutes later. And then we pushed forward, tried to score, we scored twice but we didn't have the time to do better.\"",
      "On playing youngsters: \"They have to understand this season is really important also to understand that we cannot do this anymore. Of course, we know the context, but this kind of season we need to change that. They need to understand what it is to play for Manchester United.",
      "\"I think they did really well. They are not playing so much, but then they have to play 90 minutes because we have to change some other players to save them for Thursday.",
      "\"I think we can help the young kids even more, especially Tyler Fredricson did quite well in the third goal. He needs more help from Amad. So these small things I think we can help them more, but I'm really happy with the performance of the young kids.\"",
      "On De Ligt's injury: \"We don't know what will happen with De Ligt. If we don't have Luke Shaw available on Thursday we could have a problem and then we don't have enough defenders for the game. We had to protect some players at half-time, thinking about Thursday. So it was just that, not about thinking about the game.\""

      "Our betting expert Jones Knows unleashes his insight and angles across the Premier League and thinks Liverpool are a juicy price to beat Chelsea.",
      "It's always worth keeping the player shots lines on your mind against Brentford as their style of play does tend to a high volume of shots conceded. Only Southampton have faced more shots this season than the Bees (588).",
      "This brings forward the case to back Manuel Ugarte to have two or more shots at 9/4 with Sky Bet.",
      "Which Premier League teams will qualify for Europe?",
      "Not known for his shots volume, the midfielder has come to life in that regard under Ruben Amorim, averaging 1.9 shots per 90 across his last 13 appearances. Those backing his two or more shots line have copped a return on six of those occasions.",
      "If the Tottenham that showed up in midweek against Bodo/Glimt does so again - a team full of aggression, creative spark and defensive focus - then West Ham are here for the taking.",
      "However, it's likely that we're going to see the Spurs side that have taken just 16 points away from home this season in the Premier League, losing 10 times. It wouldn't surprise me to see any of three match outcomes here. Great help, I know.",
      "A better angle is in the Tottenham player fouls market where Ben Davies stands out at 7/4 with Sky Bet to make two or more fouls.",
      "West Ham's tricky trio of Jarrod Bowen, Mohamed Kudus and Lucas Paqueta are foul drawing kings.",
      "The last 33 centre backs to have played against West Ham under Graham Potter have made 38 fouls between them with 25 of those 33 making at least one foul. Davies is showing clear signs of decline, making five fouls in his last four starts and is likely to be exposed at some point.",
      "Brighton remain a team to fade, especially against such a relentless and well coached side like Newcastle with a goal in their sights. The Seagulls have conceded at least twice in each of their last six Premier League games and shipped 24 goals in their last 11 league encounters.",
      "These poor returns certainly marry up with my opinion that Fabian Hurzeler is struggling to get the best out of this talented squad.",
      "Newcastle have scored two or more goals in six of their last seven matches and sometimes the obvious bet is the best bet.",
      "Therefore, Alexander Isak to score in a Newcastle win looks a great bet to attack at 9/4 with Sky Bet.",
      "This time of year always brings about big decisions for punters - which teams are overpriced based on a perceived lack of motivation? If Liverpool were going for the title there would be no way you'd be getting 21/10 with Sky Bet on an away win. But the 'week on the beers' theory is certainly affecting their price - wrongly in my opinion, so Liverpool have to be the bet.",
      "Also, Mohamed Salah is a man completely motivated by numbers and breaking records.",
      "He is just two goals away from breaking the record for goal involvements for the season currently held jointly held by Andy Cole and Alan Shearer (47). The Egyptian looks a fine bet to add to his tally of 28 goals and 18 assists by grabbing another goal involvement in a win for Arne Slot's machine team. Salah to score or assist and Liverpool to win can be combined through the BuildABet function to generate an 11/4 shot with Sky Bet.",
      "Nottingham Forest's season has been built around the magnificent trio of Nikola Milenkovic, Murillo and Matz Sels.",
      "But just like when forwards lose their form in front of goal that in turn affects the output of a team, the same can happen in defence and that's occurring with Forest. Mistakes are now being made at key moments in matches and Forest's defensive numbers are now that of a mid-table team.",
      "Across their last 12 Premier League matches their expected goals against process is working at 1.77 per 90 - only Leicester, Ipswich and Southampton have a worse defensive process.",
      "This is seriously worrying for Forest and their hopes of Champions League.",
      "And it makes them impossible to fancy up against such a dangerous and powerful Crystal Palace attack, where Eberechi Eze is sparkling once again. He is 4/1 with Sky Bet to score for a third game in a row. That's generous.",

      "United were three up at half-time after breaching Europe's tightest home defence at the Estadio de San Mames, where the LaLiga side hadn't lost since August.",
      "It took something special to unlock Athletic Club when Harry Maguire momentarily turned into a winger, showing quick feet on the right before crossing into the near post for Manuel Ugarte, who flicked the ball on for Casemiro to head home the opener in the 30th minute.",
      "Athletic Club: Agirrezabala (6); De Marcos (5), Vivian (3), Alvarez (5), Berchiche (5); Jauregizar (5), Galarreta (5); I. Williams (5), Berenguer (5), N.

      "The entire tie changed within seven minutes after Rasmus Hojlund was pulled back by Dani Vivian when he tried to reach a low cross in the six-yard box. The referee sent the Athletic Club centre-back off and awarded United a penalty, which Fernandes cooly dispatched, after consulting the pitchside monitor.",
      "Athletic Club made two substitutions to try and halt United's momentum, but Fernandes added a third before the half was finished, slotting home from Ugarte's clever backheel to put the visitors in dreamland.",
      "United eased off in the second half with a controlled performance to prevent the hosts from finding anyway back into the tie.",
      "Casemiro went close to his second of the night, hitting a post with a header at a corner before Fernandes and Garnacho both had shots parried by goalkeeper Julen Agirrezabala.",

      "Man Utd head coach Ruben Amorim admitted \"nobody expected\" the magnitude of their 3-0 Europa League semi-final first leg win at Athletic Club but insisted the tie was still not over ahead of next week's return match.",
      "His side became only the third to win at San Mames since August and inflicted the joint-biggest defeat on their hosts at the stadium in over a decade, putting one foot in the Europa League final at the same stadium later this month - where they look likely to meet Premier League rivals Tottenham.",
      "United weathered an early storm from the hosts but took the lead through Casemiro's header, and then played much of the game with a man advantage after centre-back Dani Vivian conceded a penalty and was sent off for pulling back Rasmus Hojlund in his own box.",
      "Despite scoring three goals in the final 15 minutes of the opening period, the one criticism of the visitors' performance was that they did not manage to add to their advantage and kill off the tie as a contest.",
      "Man Utd are the only remaining team unbeaten in Europe this season, in stark contrast to their Premier League campaign where they have lost 15 of 34 league games - but even so, the head coach had not been expecting such an emphatic victory in the Basque country.",
      "\"It's the best result because nobody expected this result,\" he said. \"But you saw two games today - the first 25 minutes and then, after the goal and the sending-off, the game changed.",
      "\"In the second half, we tried to be cautious and we created chances but the most important thing is the opponent didn't get many shots on our goal.",
      "\"We've improved in the last games. I don't look just at the results. We had some games that we won that we didn't play well and some games we lost but played well. Sometimes you need a little bit of luck.",
      "\"In the first 30 minutes, they had chances to score. If they score, it's a different game. When we scored, we felt more free to play.",
      "\"It's hard to understand but sometimes it's the context. We can win this competition. In the Premier League, we are suffering game after game. We try to manage both things with some injuries. Sometimes it's hard, even for the players.\"",
      "Amorim sounded a note of caution despite the size of Man Utd's victory, and the meteoric collapse which would be required for them to be eliminated.",
      "Of 133 previous first-leg away wins by three goals in European knock-out ties, all 133 teams have progressed to the next round.",
      "Hojlund could not add to the last-gasp equaliser he netted at Bournemouth at the weekend but did put in a strong shift leading the line for United, proving an agile target man while also showing far better positional awareness than he has in recent games.",
      "Amorim has kept faith with the beleaguered striker through his prolonged struggles this season, in part due to a lack of senior alternatives, and gave him a vote of confidence following his performance in Thursday's game.",
      "\"It was the best game he had with me as coach,\" he said. \"He helped the team a lot. He secured the ball and made runs. It was a good moment for him but like Harry (Maguire) he needs to understand everything can change so let's focus on the next one. This one is in the past.\""
