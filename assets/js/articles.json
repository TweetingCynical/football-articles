      "Once hailed as the epitome of unity and stardom, the Beckham household is now facing a very public family fallout that has left fans taken aback. Central to the turmoil is the deteriorating relationship between David Beckham and his oldest son, Brooklyn Beckham.",
      "Brooklyn's noticeable no-show at David's extravagant 50th birthday festivities earlier this month, combined with persistent family discord, has shone a harsh light on their fractured bond. To grasp how things got to this point, it's worth looking back to a critical turning point: when Brooklyn chose to walk away from football.",
      "This was an emotional moment that deeply impacted David and exposed the complicated layers of their bond.",
      "In 2014, Brooklyn, then just 15, decided to step away from football, even though he was in Arsenal's youth academy at the time. David, an international sporting icon and Manchester United legend, had long envisioned his son following in his footsteps.",
      "But Brooklyn, now 26, decided to carve out an entirely different identity for himself – pursuing photography, fashion, and entrepreneurship. In a 2015 interview with ABC, David claimed that it \"broke his heart\" to discover Brooklyn had been weighed down by the pressure of his famous surname.",
      "\"One of my boys turned around to me the other day and said, 'Daddy, I'm not sure I want to play football all the time,'\" David said. \"It broke my heart a little bit. He said, 'Every time I step on to the field, I know people are saying, 'This is David Beckham's son,' and if I am not as good as you, then it is not good enough.'\"",
      "Speaking to Variety in 2022, Brooklyn admitted that while quitting football made him \"sad,\" his father ultimately supported him. \"My dad wasn't sad, because he was like, 'I just want you to be happy,'\" Brooklyn said. \"But of course, I was sad. It was my whole life since I was literally two.\"",
      "This moment highlighted David's true nature – not as a controlling parent demanding his child fulfil inherited dreams, but as someone genuinely trying to respect Brooklyn's individuality.",
      "Brooklyn later opened up about his struggles with anxiety and the immense burden of expectations. He said he \"never really enjoyed\" the game, in part due to harsh scrutiny from coaches who expected him to emulate his dad's legendary career.",
      "That immense pressure turned football from a passion into a source of distress. Though it hurt, David acknowledged his son's right to choose a different path. But what once appeared as mutual respect may have slowly evolved into emotional estrangement.",
      "Now, in 2025, the Beckham family is mired in an ongoing feud. Brooklyn and Nicola Peltz skipped all of David's milestone birthday events – including an elegant Miami soiree, a countryside gathering in the Cotswolds, and a glitzy affair at the Met Gala in London.",
      "Insiders say Brooklyn avoided the celebrations due to underlying tensions linked to Nicola, who some insiders blame for worsening the family fallout. One report claims Brooklyn asked for a separate celebration without Romeo's partner, Kim Turnbull, with whom Brooklyn reportedly shares a complicated history.",
      "David declined, emphasising the importance of celebrating as a full family. That refusal apparently hurt Brooklyn, who chose to forgo the events entirely – a decision that has left both David and Victoria hurt.",
      "Tensions have been building since Brooklyn and Nicola's 2022 wedding, which was reportedly marred by disagreements and miscommunications with Victoria. While the two sides made brief strides toward healing, that progress appears to have reversed.",
      "Brooklyn's continued absence from major family events, including Victoria's 51st birthday in April, and the silence around his wedding anniversary have only deepened public suspicions of estrangement.",
      "David appeared to extend an olive branch with a birthday post captioned: \"You were missed @brooklynbeckham\". But Brooklyn's decision to prioritise Nicola and sidestep family moments has seemingly intensified the emotional distance, leaving the family torn and adrift."

      "The Glazer family have hit a landmark many Manchester United supporters hoped would never come. The American billionaires have now been in charge of the Premier League giants for 20 years - and it's been a period packed full of incident and controversy.",
      "Although Joel and Avram Glazer have been the most prominent members of the family who bought United in 2005 for £790million, it was Malcom Glazer who oversaw the deal. The ride has been rocky almost ever since, with United supporters regularly protesting against what they see as absentee owners who are only interested in bleeding the club of its money.",
      "The arrival of Sir Jim Ratcliffe and his INEOS team last year has done little to change the opinion of most United fans. But while Ratcliffe has taken control over business decisions in exchange for £1.3bn, the Glazers, who also own NFL franchise Tampa Bay Buccaneers, have remained unbowed in their decision to stay involved at United.",
      "The Glazers buy out Irish shareholders John Magnier and JP McManus to control 57 percent of the club and become majority stakeholders. Days later, they increased their stake to 75 percent.",
      "United is delisted by the Glazers following their takeover, with the club plunged into debt of around £700m, leading to the first major protests from fans. Joel, Bryan and Avram Glazer visit Old Trafford and are forced to leave in the back of a police van to avoid a baying mob of fans.",
      "United fans start wearing green and gold scarves, produced by the Manchester United Supporters’ Trust (MUST) during the League Cup final win over Aston Villa. The scarves, displaying the colours of Newton Heath, the club formed in 1878 which became United in 1902, become an instantly-recognisable anti-Glazer symbol.",
      "United sell Cristinao Ronaldo to Real Madrid for a world record fee of £80m, but even that cannot stop the club's debt rising from £660m £716m, while a refinancing of that debt, incurring greater interest, sparks more protests from militant fans.",
      "United starts trading on the New York Stock Exchange, with the Glazers making £75m by selling a significant chunk of their shares.",
      "Malcolm Glazer, who never once visited Old Trafford, dies aged 85. The Glazer family sell a further portion of their shareholding, making them £129m, and reiterate their stance of not selling the club for at least five years.",
      "The Glazer family continues to make personal profit from United, selling another chunk of shares that makes them £56.85m, with none of that money being ploughed back into the club.",
      "Driven by Joel Glazer, United are one of the leaders behind the breakaway European Super League, but fans reacted furiously to the proposal, storming Old Trafford to force the postponement of their Premier League game against Liverpool in May. The backlash sees United pull out of the proposal.",
      "United fans opposed to the Glazers react with delight when the family announces it is “commencing a process to explore strategic alternatives”, suggesting an end to their toxic 17-year spell in charge.",
      "INEOS founder Sir Jim Ratcliffe and Qatar millionaire Sheikh Jassim bin Hamad al Thani bid to buy United. Ratcliffe is ultimately successful, acquiring a quarter share of the club, after Sheikh Jassim withdraws his bid.",
      "Ratcliffe purchases a 25 percent stake in United and gains control of football operations at the club under the terms of his acquisition.",
      "United's revenue drops to £198.7m for the final three months of 2024, down from £225.8m for the same period the previous year, with the club debt £731m, as well as owing more than £300m in transfer fees. The figures come on the back of United making 250 staff redundant, with up to 200 more job losses planned."

      "Both started the first leg at San Mames, where United won 3-0 to put one foot in the final. However, neither can be called upon for the return game at Old Trafford as Athletic chase an unlikely comeback.",
      "Nico has been used sparingly in the league of late, with manager Ernesto Valverde aiming to keep him fresh for Europe. He missed out entirely against Real Sociedad over the weekend, though,and is not available on Thursday night.",
      "Inaki did play in that match, but made way for Alvaro Djalo around an hour into the goalless draw. And the two Williams brothers aren't the only stars missing.",
      "Top scorer Oihan Sancet missed the first leg through injury and has not recovered in time to play a part at Old Trafford. Dani Vivian will also miss out, with the defender's red card in the first leg earning him a suspension.",
      "United hold a commanding advantage as they prepare to welcome Ernesto Valverde's team to Old Trafford. The first leg hinged on a contentious penalty call, with Vivian sent off following a VAR check after being ruled to have fouled Rasmus Hojlund.",
      "Ruben Amorim's team already led 1-0 through Casemiro at that stage, and captain Bruno Fernandes doubled the lead from the penalty spot. Fernandes added his second and United's third on the stroke of half-time.",
      "United star Casemiro hailed the role played by the fans as Amorim's men chase European glory. The semi against Athletic comes after a dramatic late comeback against Lyon in the previous round, and the Red Devils are now within touching distance of a final against Tottenham or Bodo/Glimt.",
      "“Of course, when you do not win, it is difficult to be loyal and support the team,\" Casemiro told club media. \"This year, in the European competition, we are a little bit closer but, in the league, we aren’t where we should be, and we aren’t playing well. But the fans are something incredible. It isn’t normal how good they are.",
      "\"It isn’t normal how they support us and help us. The other night against Lyon was an unforgettable night in my career and something incredible, an incredible game. They always support us — whether we are playing well or badly. When I get home, I speak with my family or my inner circle about what the fans are like here.",
      "“All I can say, from my heart, is thank you very much. If they didn’t support us like they do, it would be even more difficult, so the thing we have to say to everyone who comes to games here, and to the whole city, is it’s something incredible. So, all I can say is thank you, thank you very much.\""

      "The seeds of Manchester United's current crisis were ultimately sown 20 years ago, when the Glazer family gained control of the club. Under two decades of ownership under the Glazers, United have gone from being debt-free to owing around £1billion, according to their latest financial results.",
      "On May 12, 2005, Irish racing magnates John Magnier and JP McManus sold their 28.89 per cent stake in United to Florida-based businessman Malcolm Glazer. There were already concerns at United over the leveraged nature of the Glazer takeover, but nothing could prepare fans for what was to come under the family's controversial ownership.",
      "Magnier and McManus famously fell out with Sir Alex Ferguson over the stud rights to the racehorse Rock of Gibraltar, with the grubby dispute, played out in public, ultimately leading to the Glazers owning United. With the shareholding from Magnier and McManus, the Glazers controlled 76.2 percent of United and delisted the company in June 2005, beginning two decades of the most toxic club ownership in the history of English football.",
      "Since then, the Glazer family are estimated to have made £1billion from United to line their own pockets, with the club paying out the same amount in interest to facilitate their controversial leveraged buy-out of the club. Despite sustained protests and demonstrations from United fans over the past 20 years, the Glazers remain in overall control of the club, hated by the club's supporters as much now as when they took over.",
      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe and his INEOS team may be in charge of football operations at United, having acquired a 28 per cent stake in the club, but the Glazers remain in overall control, despite the best efforts of fans to oust them. Put simply, the Glazers – who profess to love United despite rarely attending games and having almost zero dialogue with the fans – are making too much money from one of the world's biggest clubs to walk away.",
      "Steve Crompton, from The 1958, a United fan group which continues to organise protest marches and demonstrations against the Glazers, said the campaign to rid them from the club will carry on until they achieve that goal.",
      "“The Glazers have drained this club of millions,” said Crompton. “They’ve ripped the heart out of Manchester United and divided the fan base. Two decades ago, they pushed away a loyal section of supporters — and they never came back.",
      "“For 20 years, they’ve bled the club dry, taking dividends while the team and the stadium have been left to rot. We need a new stadium because they’ve neglected Old Trafford for two whole decades. They don’t care about the club. We do.",
      "“United fans love this club — and we hate the Glazers. They’ve poisoned the atmosphere, corrupted the identity, and infected this once-great institution with a toxicity that won’t begin to heal until they’re gone. That’s why, after 20 years, we’re still fighting. And we won’t stop until this toxic ownership is history. Not today, not ever.”",
      "Journalist Chris Blackhurst, whose book, The World’s Biggest Cash Machine , looks at the Glazer ownership of United, said they will stay put as long as the revenue streams keep pouring in, but suggested they could sell if the revenue streams dry up.",
      "“If you talk to the fans, they will say that the Glazers don't love the club,” said Blackhurst. “You hear Joel Glazer has an office that's a shrine to United and whenever they play, everything in Glazerland stops. That may be true, but he's never shown it.",
      "“They don't go to matches, they don't communicate and now it's too late. Sir Jim Ratcliffe was seen as a white knight, this saviour coming in, but now he's got to watch that he's not just become a patsy for the Glazers.",
      "“If you look at all the coverage since Ratcliffe came in, it's all about him – the Glazers are hardly mentioned, yet they're still the majority owners and still in control.",
      "“The crucial thing for the Glazers is the amount of commercial sponsorship coming in. If that dips, and with it United's global reach on social media and the TV audiences, they may consider their options.”"

He added: “Although I know how talented I am, I prioritised going where I knew I’d be happy, even though I had better offers. It’s important to score goals and provide assists but being happy is even more important.”",
      "Antony has pointed to a number of elements contributing to his improved form while in Spain. After his recent outing, he also praised Betis boss Manuel Pellegrini for his contribution.",

      "United boss Ruben Amorim gave his take on why Antony was thriving in Spain earlier this season. The Portuguese boss claimed that the lesser physicality of La Liga had allowed him to unlock his best form - a suggestion that was emphatically dismissed by the winger’s agent.",
      "Regardless, Antony will be aiming to continue his hot form over the coming week as Betis face a number of key games. They at first take on Fiorentina in the second leg of their Europa Conference League semi-final on Thursday.",
      "They then face a clash with Osasuna at the weekend. Betis currently sit sixth in La Liga and just one point off of the Champions League places with four matches left to play."

      "Arsene Wenger has suggested a major reform of football's offside rule could come as soon as next year. The legendary Arsenal boss has long been a chief proponent of making a change and it is now on the agenda.",
      "Wenger, now FIFA's chief of global football development, hopes to introduce a 'daylight' principle to offsides. A player would be deemed as onside if any part of their body that can score a goal is behind or level with the relevant defender.",
      "The idea was first proposed as early as 2020 and after positive trials in Sweden, Italy and the Netherlands and Wenger has hoped to push forward quickly with changes through the International FA Board (IFAB).",
      "And there seems to have been some acceleration to Wenger's bid to fix the issues around offside decisions, with a possible judgement coming next year. Speaking on beIN Sports, Wenger said: \"In 1990 it was decided that it's not offside if you're on the same line as the defender and the striker has advantage if there was doubt.",
      "\"With VAR, this advantage disappeared. I think in England they cancelled 37 goals on marginal offsides, it's very frustrating. It's why I proposed that as long as you're on the same line, you're not offside. In one year the decision will be made by IFAB, not by me.\"",
      "Wenger has proven an open book in his thoughts on football in recent weeks. The Frenchman may have caused uproar in some areas of Manchester and London as he suggested it is 'not right' that the winner of the Europa League is rewarded with a place in the Champions League.",
      "Manchester United and Tottenham are both in advantageous positions to make the competition's finale and the Premier League could find itself with an additional spot in the Champions League. UEFA made the decision to offer a place in the competition as a reward for victory in the Europa League back in 2014",
      "Wenger has called for that to be reviewed, and believes the policy is unfair. Asked for his position, he said. \"No - they should qualify automatically for the Europa League again but not necessarily for the Champions League.",
      "\"Especially when you're in the Premier League where already five teams qualify. I think it's something (for Uefa) to think about and to review.",
      "\"On the other hand people will tell you that to keep the Europa League focused, interesting and motivated you need to give them that prize (of qualifying for the Champions League).\"",
      "As it stands, despite United and Spurs both being in the bottom half of the Premier League, they could win a place in Europe's top competition. Four teams in the league usually qualify but the Premier League have won an extra spot due to the collective performance of English teams in Europe.",
      "A tournament win from United or Spurs would see a sixth place awarded."

It is believed that he was close to signing for Ineos-owned FC Lausanne Sport on loan in January before opting for Rochdale, who he has helped reach the National League play-offs.",

The left-back, who recently captained the Under-21s against Wolves and scored against West Ham in the PL2 play-offs on Monday, has been a steady performer in the academy.",
      "Nolan, 19, a jack-of-all-trades on the pitch, joined Inverness Caledonian Thistle in Scottish League One on loan during the summer transfer window and has since made 33 appearances. The Chorley-born player has mainly been seen holding down the fort at full-back for Caledonian Thistle.",
      "The three will be part of a huge cohort of players seeking new employers in the summer. It was reported earlier this week, that only four players are deemed as untouchable by the United hierarchy, with the club open to offers on every other player.",
      "The quartet, as reported by the Daily Star, are understood to be Harry Maguire, Patrick Dorgu, Amad and captain Bruno Fernandes.",
      "Aside from those, United are open for business as they look to raise funds for a huge rebuild under Ruben Amorim. The Portuguese boss wants players that suit his system, but there is an understanding that outgoing business will need to be conducted first.",
      "Along with the players that can be sold for fees, four senior stars will be out of contract. Tom Heaton, Christian Eriksen and Jonny Evans will all leave, while Victor Lindelof is still unsure over whether he will be offered a new deal."

      "Wilson broke onto the scene by making an emphatic impact on his United debut. Playing under Ryan Giggs in the final home match of the 2013/14 season, the then 18-year-old bagged a brace to introduce himself to Red Devils fans to dramatic effect.",

      "\"He is a natural goalscorer but he has got more to his game than that,\" Giggs said of Wilson. \"He can run at people, he has got pace and he is a clever player.\"",
      "Despite earning 20 appearances in his United career, Wilson failed to make the cut with the 13-times Premier League champions. After loans Brighton, Derby and Sheffield United, a loan spell to Aberdeen became a permanent one.",
      "Following his time in Scotland, Wilson has had spells with Salford City and Port Vale. The striker then completed a move to Northampton Town ahead of the 2024/25 season.",
      "Wilson signed a one-year deal with the option of a further 12 months but failed to hit the heights for the Cobblers. The former Old Trafford prospect failed to score in 12 appearances for the club and has been released.",

      "\"We believe we have a good core of players here, both in terms of ability and culture, which is very important, and we are excited to be entering into discussions with our chosen targets to build on and add to that over the course of the summer.\""

      "\"Cleverley stabilised performances at the end of the 2023/24 season in an interim position before his full-time appointment last summer. At one stage, the Golden Boys were part of the play-off picture but, unfortunately, performances and results drifted with just five wins in 2025.\"",

      "That form has seen United and Chelsea retain their interest in the forward but it appears that they are going to be left frustrated again. According to Turkish outlet Milliyet, Galatasaray have managed to put together the £56m fee they have to pay in order to sign him permanently.",
      "Galatasaray boss Okan Buruk has also attempted to intervene, having promised Osimhen that he could stay at Galatasaray for a further season and play in the Champions League. The club would then not stand in his way if an offer to return to Europe was tabled in 2026.",
      "All that remains is for Osimhen to give his approval to a move and based on his recent comments, he would be open to staying. Speaking recently, he said: “It’s a great feeling.",

I am at one of the most important clubs in the world. The biggest club in Türkiye. I would like to thank my family and friends for helping me. I would like to thank the technical team and the club staff.",

      "United once had Milinkovic-Savic on their books but were unable to sort a work permit out and had to release him as a result. In May 2014, United reached an agreement to sign the goalkeeper from Vojvodina, setting them back just shy of £2million. He remained there on loan for another season but never actually made an appearance for the Red Devils.",
      "Having failed to earn a work permit to play in England Milinkovic-Savic was released in November 2015 and he signed a four-and-a-half-year contract with Polish club Lechia Gdansk, before later moving to Italy.",
      "The Serbian has said on his own future: “I have learned that setting goals is not a positive thing, it is better to do things with the lights off. Then in all teams there are replacements of players who are sold and bought, the important thing is to find the right players to strengthen the team.”",

The Cameroon shotstopper's ability with his feet was seen as a huge bonus, but he's made numerous mistakes that have led to goals in both his seasons in Manchester.",

      "Altay Bayindir is expected to depart as he eyes more minutes to further his Turkey ambitions and a return to his homeland is on the cards. Tom Heaton - the club's third choice - has his contract expiring at the end of the season with no decision made on his future but there is an expectation that the veteran stopper could retire."

Manchester City, Newcastle and Chelsea have opened up a gap to Nottingham Forest and Aston Villa for the Champions League, while Bournemouth and Brentford still harbour hopes of reaching the Conference League further down.",
      "In the Champions League, this week brings the second legs of the semi-finals, with Inter Milan hosting Barcelona on Tuesday night after their stunning 3-3 draw last week before Arsenal attempt to overturn their 1-0 deficit against Paris Saint-Germain on Wednesday.",
      "Thursday brings the Europa League semis, where Manchester United hold a commanding 3-0 lead over Athletic Bilbao for their home leg, while Tottenham could set up an all-English final due to their 3-1 win over Bodo/Glimt last week. That is the back drop for today's news, which has a focus on transfers.",
      "United are willing to sell just about any of their players this summer. Ruben Amorim's squad clearly needs an overhaul and the INEOS ownership are taking a pragmatic - and perhaps brutal - stance over the current crop of players.",
      "Bruno Fernandes is deemed untouchable and will not be sold, despite rumoured interest from Saudi Arabian side Al-Hilal. Fernandes has once again been easily the best player for United this season and Sir Jim Ratcliffe is not ready to sell off the crown jewels.",
      "The Portuguese midfielder exists in a category alongside veteran defender Harry Maguire, young attacker Amad and January signing Patrick Dorgu. But every single other player could be sold off to provide funds to be reinvested, with profit and sustainability rules a concern this summer.",

      "The 26-year-old has three more games in a Liverpool shirt to enjoy and his team-mates have reacted to the news on social media.

Scotland captain Robertson added: “Brother for life!! We’ve been through it all together!”",
      "There doesn't appear to be any sour grapes in the dressing room. Harvey Elliott wrote: “Unbelievable player! Even better guy. Trent Alexander-Arnold Enjoy it brother. Thank you!\"",

      "New sporting director Andrea Berta is already looking further ahead, to the summer transfer window, which opens for business on June 1. The Gunners are chasing three big signings this summer, with Real Sociedad midfielder Martin Zubimendi the first, arriving for a £51million buy-out clause.",
      "Elsewhere, they want a top-class No.9 and a winger. Sporting Lisbon striker Viktor Gyökeres and RB Leipzig’s Benjamin Sesko more realistic targets than Newcastle’s Alexander Isak, while Athletic Bilbao’s Nico Williams is their dream ticket on the wing."

      "Manchester United flop Antony has heaped praise on Real Betis boss Manuel Pellegrini for helping him rediscover his mojo on loan in Spain. Antony, 25, continued his outstanding form for Betis on Sunday, scoring a magnificent winning goal in the 91st minute as they beat Espanyol 2-1.",
      "The crucial result moves them to within a point of fifth-placed Villarreal, who occupy the final Champions League spot in LaLiga. Antony's curling strike from outside the penalty area made it two goals in his last two appearances, having also netted in Thursday's Conference League semi-final first leg at home to Fiorentina.",
      "Antony joined Betis until the end of the season in January and has impressed so much that the Spanish side want to sign him permanently. There've even been reports that LaLiga giants Atletico Madrid have contacted United to discuss a move in the region of £34million.",
      "Goals like his strike on Sunday will do him no harm, as he looks a different player to the one who failed miserably at Old Trafford. Antony failed to live up to his £86m price tag during two-and-a-half tumultuous years at United, where he eventually found himself out of favour under new manager Ruben Amorim.",
      "But the Brazilian has clicked with former Manchester City boss Pellegrini, whose full support has left Antony feeling 'grateful'. \"It's very important because I've said in many interviews that I've found myself because I'm happy, things are going well,\" he told Movistar Plus post-match.",
      "\"The coach joked with me because I scored great goals with my right foot, but he asked me when I'd do it with my left foot. I gave him a hug after scoring because he's someone I care deeply about and I'm grateful for his trust.\"",
      "The winger, who now has seven goals and four assists in 20 games for Betis, also said: \"Very happy with the win, with the amazing goal at the end of the match. We knew it would be very difficult, and now we can enjoy the victory because it's very important.\"",
      "Betis chief executive Ramon Alarcon has said the club are 'cautiously optimistic' about the prospect of keeping Antony in Seville beyond the summer. Alarcon told Canal Sur: \"When we spoke about the possibility to bring Antony in January, I saw it more distant than I see now him staying.",
      "\"It's because both Manchester United and the player have seen that Real Betis is a great place for the player to develop. Right now I'm more optimistic than in January.\"",
      "The Betis CEO added: \"It's going to be difficult because he is a player owned by Manchester with financial conditions that are what they are. I am cautiously optimistic.\""

      "United are 3-0 up following the first leg of their semi-final in Bilbao six days ago. A double from Bruno Fernandes and a Casemiro header have United in control of the tie heading into the second leg at Old Trafford tomorrow night.",
      "United know that if they avoid defeat they will be through to the final of the Europa League, and even defeat by a one or two goal margin will be enough to see them through.",
      "With Champions League qualification on the line, this is one of United's biggest games in decades, and the players and Amorim have been keen to stress that the job is not done.",
      "The United head coach will provide the early team news this afternoon along with any injury updates. Athletic have already named their travelling squad for the game and have been rocked by the news they will be without three of their most dangerous players.",
      "Stick with us throughout the day as we bring you build-up, updates and reaction from Amorim's press conference.",
      "\"The idea of of Athletic will not change, but the characteristics of the players will change, and that is important for us to know. It is going to be a strong team with a strong identity.\"",
      "\"We know that we are not doing a great job in the Premier League. But the manager said before that we have followed the rules and tomorrow is a final, and we will face it like it is 0-0. If we win the Europa League, we will be in the Champions League and we will face next season with a different mentality and in a different way.\"",
      "\"I think you have to see the quotes in the moment, so things can change. If you look to the Premier League, since I arrive, we are the worst team since I arrived. At the end of this season, we can be the worst team in Premier League history with a European title. This season has been really disappointing for everyone, but nothing is going to change. In that moment, sometimes I have to think a little bit more.\"",
      "\"I just know the rules. If people want to change the rules, by all means. But these are the rules and the rules are that you win the Europa League, you go to the Champions League, so we will follow the rules. I don't think a lot about it. I know that the Champions League is for the champions or the best team in the leagues. We are just following the rules.\"",
      "\"It doesn't matter. For us, it doesn't matter. We need to go to the game. It is a final for us and we need to go to it to win the game.\"",
      "\"The meaning is that you have to win it. As a manager, it is not like the same as a player, who wants to play and enjoy it. As a manager, you have to win it. If you lose in the final, it will hurt even more, especially in this kind of season. It is different from coach to a player. We will focus on our semi-final.\"",
      "\"We are improving the way we play, we are more confident and we are ready to face this challenge.\"",
      "\"It's everything together. If you look at our team, we cannot say today what is going to happen. There are some teams in any league that can understand the game is going to be like this and could change a little bit. We have to face the game as one more game. I feel we have to score to go to the next round. That is how we are going to approach the game. We will have to suffer a little bit to go to the final, and we are ready to suffer.\"",
      "\"I am not focused on the numbers. I think when Cristiano [Ronaldo] played here it was a different type of football and a different type of game. We are training really hard, me, Rasmus [Hojlund], all the strikers in the team. I think we are improving and trying to get better.\"",
      "\"I had a feeling that they [Athletic] were really intense, but most of the opportunities were a little bit our fault; we lost possession. They created chances because when we lost the ball we had problems. Sometimes, we have 30 minutes with a lot of problems and we show the players why we had that problem. We watched it quite a few times. We showed them why we had so many problems in the first 30 minutes.\"",
      "\"I think it is not easy in the middle of the season when you change the manager and all the staff. In my mind, I just try to work hard every day and show the manager that I want to play.\"",
      "\"I think it is easy to understand that [transfer speculation], not just because of the numbers but the way he plays. He is a top player and we need to top players. He is a leader, the captain. It is natural that people want Bruno, but we want to keep him. He is one of the top players of the world.\"",

      "Alongside De Ligt, Jonny Evans, who drove into Carrington 15 minutes after the session had started, and Toby Collyer were also unaccounted for in the Carrington sunshine. The latter has been absent for just over a month with a leg injury, but he was spotted training individually last week.",
      "Christian Eriksen was another player not spotted at training on Wednesday morning but United insist he is fit and available ahead of the clash with Bilbao.",

      "Manchester United have trained at Carrington as they finalise preparations for their Europa League semi-final second leg against Athletic Club at Old Trafford on Thursday.",
      "United have at least one foot in the final after winning 3-0 in Bilbao last week. The news that Nico and Inaki Williams will miss the second leg has boosted their chances of securing a return to the city on May 21.",
      "Ruben Amorim was without Matthijs de Ligt during Wednesday's training session after he limped off against Brentford this week. Christian Eriksen was also missing, and his absence was considered a precaution.",
      "The 15 minutes we get to see of open training usually means we get a glimpse of the warm-up rondos, and it always proves the point about how competitive professional footballers are.",
      "There is always a desire to string as many passes together as possible, but towards the end of the drill there was a heated debate about the rules of the rondos.",
      "Harry Maguire was convinced he was swapping with Rasmus Hojlund, only for the striker to hold his ground and say he hadn't broken any rules. Hojlund stopped the ball with his hands to set the drill up, but Maguire felt he had committed an infringement. For a few seconds they both stood in the outer circle, refusing to give any ground.",
      "Hojlund said 'no, no' as Maguire tried to swap. The centre-back responded with 'you can't stop it twice, everyone knows that rule'. In the end, assistant coach Carlos Fernandes blew his whistle and the players headed off to do something else, but it showed how competitive things can get.",
      "There was the usual pre-training tunnel in the Carrington sunshine, with three players running through it and getting slaps from their teammates.",
      "Chido Obi was first to line up after making his first professional start at Brentford, before Bruno Fernandes told Mason Mount to get in the queue after his first start in five months.",
      "Just as it looked like it would be those two running the gauntlet, Amorim instructed Luke Shaw to take his place as well, having captained United for the first time in the defeat at the Gtech Community Stadium.",
      "We don't often see goalkeepers participating in the rondos, but all four of United's were involved this week, and you can see why the club is considering keeping third-choice shot-stopper Tom Heaton for another year.",
      "He might have turned 39 last week, but Heaton was one of the most vocal figures at training and set an upbeat mood at the start of the session. He engaged easily with teammates and cracked jokes as players made mistakes in the rondos.",
      "He stretched gamely to try and rescue a shaky pass from Shaw but couldn't keep the ball in, only for the Carrington sprinklers to spring into action from nowhere, sending the players scampering. It was Shaw who seemed to cope for most of the spray, and Heaton enjoyed the moment, telling him: \"That's karma.\"",
      "There was another academy call-up among the 24-man training squad at Carrington, with 18-year-old midfielder Zach Baumann included, with Christian Eriksen sitting the session out.",
      "Baumann was a quiet presence at the start of the session but fitted in as he made up the numbers in one rondo group, levelling out the numbers at 12 each.",
      "A coach called for the 'youngest player' in the other group to move to make up the numbers and although Bendito Mantato and Chido Obi are 17, Baumann took it on himself to fit in and swap groups.",
      "The absence of Matthijs de Ligt from the session wasn't quite as disastrous as it might have been, with United cruising in the tie and boosted by the absence of Nico and Inaki Williams in the Athletic Club squad.",
      "There was also the welcome sight a pitch further away of Ayden Heaven training on his own as he nears a comeback after a spell on the sidelines.",
      "The teenager has been one of the feel-good stories since his January move from Arsenal, and if he can get fit, he could feature again in the Premier League before the end of the season.",

      "Yes. Yes, definitely [I will leave Bayer Leverkusen]. I don’t have a timeframe, to be honest. But the club knows about it. And I’ve been very open with them, as I always have been. Everything was said at the start. There was a point when I made the decision not to extend my contract and not to stay here. And that’s how it’s going to go now.",

      "The Bayer Leverkusen defender will be leaving Germany at the end of this season and it is understood that a move to the Premier League is of interest.",

      "There is sense in offering Heaton a deal into his 40s anyway. He is a reliable goalkeeper, with relatively low mileage in recent years, offers plenty of experience and is considered something of a dressing room leader at Carrington.",

      "The fact that he is also departing Anfield on a free transfer will only make it more painful for United's great rivals. As an academy graduate, any transfer fee received would have gone down as pure profit on Liverpool's balance sheet. Due to the league's profit and sustainability rules (PSR), pure profit is like gold dust for Premier League clubs.",

      "Brentford defender Rico Henry was lulled into a false sense of security by Amad, who pounced at the right moment with a sharp turn of foot to score for Manchester United last weekend.",
      "The winger cut inside and scored with a driven shot. It was slightly fortuitous, as Brentford goalkeeper Mark Flekken shouldn't have been beaten, but Amad did brilliantly to create the opening.",
      "Amad had a chance of winning the Sir Matt Busby Player of the Year award until he picked up an ankle injury in February, and now Bruno Fernandes has surged to favouritism for the prize.",
      "Fernandes and Amad have been the standout performers in an awful campaign, although only Fernandes is guaranteed to start against Athletic Bilbao in the Europa League semi-final.",
      "Amad has just returned from his ankle issue and Brentford was his second substitute appearance since his rehabilitation, which suggests he'll start on the bench on Thursday night.",
      "If Amad started against Brentford and got something like 70 minutes under his belt, the chances of him starting against Bilbao would have increased, but he came on at half-time.",
      "Amad couldn't have done much more to make a case to start in the most important game of the season - he was influential and scored a goal - but Amorim is likelier to continue with Fernandes and Alejandro Garnacho in the No.10 roles, which is where they started in the first leg.",
      "Manuel Ugarte and Casemiro started in the pivot at the Estadio de San Mames, and a repeat of that defensive team selection would be logical, especially given United have a 3-0 advantage.",
      "That does mean Amad would be named on the bench. He would probably be surprised to start after only just coming back from injury and can still play an important role in the tie.",
      "Last week, Amorim said about Amad's injury: \"It was really tough on us because in that moment, he was the player that created all the situations and then pass a little bit for Bruno.",
      "\"So to lose a player like that in that moment with a lot of games was really hard for us and especially for Amad, because he was leaving [us at] a good moment. But now he's returning.",
      "\"You can feel that he's not so explosive in the moment [due to only just returning], but he's a player with a characteristic left foot, different from Garnacho, that has one against one. And we don't have many players who are able to do that. So it's massive for us. And he's one more option to play.”",
      "Amorim confirmed Amad is still not 100 per cent, which is understandable given he hasn't started a game for three months, but he will still be a tremendous option to have on the bench.",
      "Scoring just once in the second leg might be enough for United to progress to the Europa League final, and Amad could cause chaos against a tired and desperate Bilbao side who could be chasing the game at Old Trafford.",
      "The longer the game goes on, the more stretched it will become as Bilbao commit bodies forward for a goal, and they won't be able to catch a fresh Amad on the counter-attack if he's introduced from the bench.",
      "Amad was a guaranteed starter until he picked up an injury in training and having a player like that on the bench, someone who can change the game, is obviously a huge boost for Amorim.",
      "United haven't had much good news this season, but Amad's return has been great to see."

      "For a club boasting the kind of record of producing academy talent that Manchester United do, the idea they might need to consider contract decisions to fulfil Premier League and UEFA squad rules would normally sound fanciful.",
      "But as they consider offering third-choice goalkeeper Tom Heaton a 12-month contract extension, there is a degree of pragmatism in the decision ahead of a summer when a number of academy players could see their future come into sharper focus.",
      "There is sense in offering Heaton a deal into his 40s anyway. He is a reliable goalkeeper, with relatively low mileage in recent years, offers plenty of experience and is considered something of a dressing room leader at Carrington.",
      "Having come through the ranks at the club more than two decades ago, he is also an academy graduate. That brings not only an understanding of how the club operates as well as an insight into the standards required under Sir Alex Ferguson, but also the status of a home grown player under Premier League and UEFA rules.",
      "If United want to name a full 25-man squad in the Premier League next season, they must have eight players occupying home grown status (this season they had seven). To name a 25-man squad in a European competition, they also need eight home grown players, but four of those must be 'club-trained', which means they must have been on the club's books for at least three years between the age of 15 and 21.",
      "This season, United occupied those four slots with Heaton, Dermot Mee, Jonny Evans and Marcus Rashford. They named Kobbie Mainoo and Alejandro Garnacho on the B list, but could promote them to the A list to meet the club-trained criteria if required.",
      "In the Premier League there are no rules about club-trained players, and this season Evans, Heaton, Harry Maguire, Mee, Mason Mount, Rashford and Luke Shaw filled the seven home grown slots. Mainoo and Garnacho could again supplement this list, as could Harry Amass and Toby Collyer.",
      "The issue for United ahead of a potentially busy summer transfer window is that a lot of these players face uncertain futures, especially when it comes to that smaller group of club-trained players. That would only be an issue if United win the Europa League and need to name a squad for the Champions League next season, but that is now a realistic prospect and requires planning for.",
      "Of the quartet that filled those slots this season, Mee will turn 23 in November and is yet to get a look in at first-team level. He is only going to be fourth-choice goalkeeper next season if he stays at the club. Evans is set to leave when his contract expires this summer and Rashford is set to be sold after his loan at Aston Villa.",
      "There is also uncertainty over the future of Mainoo and Garnacho. United were open to offers for both in January as they looked to raise funds to reinvest and as academy graduates their sales would be considered as pure profit under the Premier League's Profit and Sustainability rules (PSR).",
      "Mainoo is yet to agree terms over a contract extension and Garnacho had interest from Chelsea and Napoli this summer. His performances have improved under Ruben Amorim but there is competition for places in the No. 10 roles and he is not yet considered a natural fit in the Portuguese's 3-4-2-1 system.",
      "If Evans, Rashford and even one of Mainoo and Garnacho depart, that could leave United light on club-trained players. That's the extra context that might make a decision to keep Heaton a sensible one.",
      "It's rare that third-choice goalkeepers end up playing an active role on the pitch, but for training and squad purposes, clubs not want an experienced player in that role. Heaton fits that brief, as well as offering United the chance to fill an academy graduate spot in squads.",

      "\"Every week, Manu Fajardo, who has done a spectacular job, has sent them the report from the player's week of training, the tactical and physical report from the player's match, and they’ve seen that we've taken very good care of their asset.",
      "\"We also have to value the player's commitment, as he has 20 days left with the team and is like one of the team members. We'll see when summer arrives if there's an option to bring him in for another year.",
      "\"If not, we'll have to look for someone else, because the important thing is really to be a team player. If it's not Antony, it will be someone else, but we have to keep competing.\""

      "The 25-year-old's spells at Old Trafford and the Estadio Benito Villamarin couldn't have gone any differently. Mere months in Spain have seen seven goals scored and four assists recorded, whereas after two-and-a-half years with United he only had 17 goal contributions to show for it.",
      "Netting again in a win over Espanyol, he told Mundo Deportivo: \"I go to bed here and wake up smiling.\"",
      "Putting past troubles aside, Antony continued: \"I always say that the best decision I've ever made was coming to Betis. I'm happy, and when I'm happy, things go well.",
      "\"For me, of course, it's important to score goals and provide assists, but being happy is even more important.",
      "\"I found myself here, I'm very happy here, and things are going very well.\"",
      "Betis do not possess an option - or obligation - to buy Antony from United once his current loan deal expires after the end of the season.",
      "He will therefore return to Old Trafford, where manager Ruben Amorim has already announced that decisions over all players currently on loan to other teams will be made upon their returns.",
      "And tying in with that, Antony says he has paid no mind towards that while he continues to relish playing.",
      "\"The future? It's very early; I don't know what's going to happen, but I'm very happy here,\" he added.",
      "\"I've found myself enjoying football. It's crazy right now, although I know how talented I am, so I prioritised going where I knew I'd be happy, even though I had better offers.\"",
      "Betis have four La Liga fixtures to go before the season ends, sitting one point outside of the top-five Champions League qualification spaces as things stand.",
      "They are also ahead after the first leg of their Europa Conference League semi-final against Fiorentina - hoping to meet Chelsea or Djurgarden in the final later this month.",
      "Last week, a Brazilian publication claimed that two unnamed clubs have made approaches to determine whether Antony is available and open to joining them in the upcoming summer transfer window."

      "Watford FC have sacked head coach and former Manchester United midfielder Tom Cleverley.",
      "The 35-year-old had initially stepped in to steady the ship towards the end of the 2023/24 season, before being officially appointed last summer. The Hornets were contenders for a play-off spot earlier this season but their form dipped with only five victories recorded in 2025.",
      "And it has now been confirmed that Cleverley has been relieved of his duties at Vicarage Road. The news comes after Watford ended the EFL Championship season in 14th place.",
      "\"We thank Tom for his service – not just in his role as Head Coach but for everything he has given Watford as a player and member of staff,\" sporting director Gian Luca Nani said in a statement on the club's website.",
      "\"But the time has come for a change and to build on what we believe is a young and talented squad that will have benefited from the experience of the Championship this season.",
      "\"It has been a privilege to work closely with Tom; to understand how he sees the game and his enthusiasm for everything here. He deserves to be recognised for this and I'm sure he will have a bright future in the game.",
      "\"Tom will always be part of Watford in recognition of all that he has achieved over so many years.\"",
      "Though Cleverley's dismissal represents Watford's 10th sacking in the last five years, he leaves as the third-longest-serving manager since Gino Pozzo took over as owner in 2012. It also ends his eight-year association with the club, having initially joined as a player from Everton in 2017."

      "Saudi Pro League club Al Hilal have reportedly identified Manchester United captain Bruno Fernandes as their ‘top target’ and have offered him a ‘three-year contract’.",
      "Fernandes signed a new deal at Man United last August and has been, by some distance, their best player this season.",
      "He remains United’s most influential player and has worn the captain’s armband since July 2023.",
      "Amorim’s side would obviously prefer to keep their star man and skipper, but they could be tempted to sell for the right price – while Fernandes himself may be swayed by a lucrative offer, especially given his age and the uncertainty at Old Trafford.",
      "It’s unclear how eager Amorim’s side would be to part with the Portuguese international, who fits the profile of players being aggressively targeted by Saudi clubs.",
      "Saudi Pro League teams have focused on signing high-profile, peak-age players to raise the league’s profile – and Fernandes would be among their most ambitious moves yet.",
      "According to transfer expert Ben Jacobs, writing for GiveMeSport, the United captain has a three-year contract offer on the table from Al Hilal, who have already snapped up Neymar, Ruben Neves and Aleksandar Mitrovic since the 2023 summer window.",
      "The report claims Al Hilal are ‘ready to make a record-breaking offer’ to sign Fernandes, who is said to be their ‘top target’.",
      "The Saudi giants had previously set aside funds to move for Mohamed Salah, but after the Egyptian signed a new Liverpool deal, their focus has shifted to the Manchester United captain.",
      "They reportedly have a staggering £510million to spend on a marquee signing, with £170million per season earmarked for wages alone.",
      "A move for Fernandes could contribute to ‘a record amount this summer in the history of football’, as Al Hilal look to add a genuine ‘superstar’ ahead of the expanded Club World Cup. They’re said to be ‘prepared to offer a British record fee’ for the 30-year-old.",
      "However, there are conflicting claims around a potential £60m release clause in Fernandes’ contract. While some reports suggest such a clause exists, United have been quick to ‘downplay this’, insisting no official release clause is in place.",
      "That said, Al Hilal reportedly ‘understand there to be a threshold’ – an informal price point – ‘above which United would be willing to negotiate, particularly if the player expresses a desire to leave Old Trafford’.",
      "The report also states that Fernandes’ representatives have been in ‘contact since the summer of 2024’ with Al Hilal over a potential move to the Middle East.",
      "A ‘non-binding offer’ has already been tabled, with a three-year contract on the cards. So far, Fernandes ‘is yet to respond’.",
      "Should he accept, he could reportedly earn up to £65m per season, but it’s believed the Portuguese playmaker ‘wants to remain in Europe until at least after the 2026 World Cup’.",

      "‘Manchester United are preparing an important summer transfer window with several movements expected. It’s not only Matheus Cunha as the club has started making contact over other potential targets ahead of the upcoming months.",
      "‘One of the positions to follow will surely be the goalkeeper; it’s not an urgent priority compared to other positions in the team, but for sure it is one of many roles Man United want to cover in the summer.",

      "Milinkovic-Savic, 28, is no stranger to Old Trafford. He was originally signed by the club back in 2014, only to be released shortly after when work permit issues prevented the then-teenager from featuring in England. A decade on, United are circling once again.",
      "Utd’s goalkeeping department has become a growing concern for head coach Ruben Amorim, with Onana’s form collapsing since the Portuguese manager took over from Erik ten Hag in November.",

      "His understudy, Altay Bayindir, has failed to convince either. The Turkish international looked uncertain when called upon, and sources indicate the 26-year-old may look to leave this summer in pursuit of more regular first-team football",
      "According to Bayindir’s agent, Utd rejected advances for the goalkeeper in the previous window, but not it seems the club may be more open to a sale this time around.",
      "As a result, Utd have accelerated their search for a new goalkeeper — a position that had initially been seen as a secondary concern this window, behind the club’s urgent need for attacking reinforcements and a midfield overhaul.",

      "Garcia has impressed in La Liga and has a release clause in the £20–25 million range, but Utd would face competition from the likes of Arsenal.",
      "Milinkovic-Savic, on the other hand, is viewed as a more accessible option. He has reportedly expressed interest in returning to Manchester, and his commanding presence, leadership, and form this season have turned heads across Europe.",

      "Wayne Rooney has hailed Harry Kane as “England’s greatest striker,” backing the Bayern Munich man as the Premier League’s finest ever number nine and insisting he should still go on to break Alan Shearer’s long-standing goalscoring record if he returns to English football.",
      "The Man Utd legend was speaking on The Overlap Fan Debate with Jamie Carragher, and admitted he was “a massive fan” of Kane, not just for his scoring, but his overall evolution as a modern forward.",
      "“He’s definitely up there,” Rooney said.",
      "“I love Harry. I think, as a goalscorer, he’s evolved his game over the last few years as well, which we’ve all seen, in dropping deep, he’s got a good range of passes, he can shoot from outside the box as well.”",
      "Harry Kane is England’s all-time leading scorer with 63 goals, and his 213 Premier League strikes leave him just 47 short of Shearer’s all-time record. It’s a mark Rooney believes he still could hit, if circumstances align.",
      "“If Harry had stayed in the Premier League, he’d break Shearer’s record for sure. Also, if he played for United, he would be considered. He still can. He still should.”",
      "But Rooney didn’t stop there, he doubled down on his belief that Kane is already the Englands best-ever frontman.",
      "“I think he’s England’s greatest striker. Just the goals he’s scored, firstly. But then you look at the games he’s played, the goals he’s scored, he’s just… You just hope. He’s probably got one tournament left in him. You hope he can push us now to that next level.”",
      "Kane’s role for England and his tendency to drop deep drew analysis, too, with Rooney acknowledging that tactical tweaks may have blunted the Three Lions’ attack in past tournaments.",
      "“In the last Euros, you had Harry coming in, you had Bellingham coming in, and they were taking up each other’s space. As a team, Harry should’ve recognised that and said, ‘No, I’m going to play up top.’ At times, you have to do that.”",

He lamented the decline of the traditional centre-forward role and said the game has changed to leave modern No. 9s “bored” and uninvolved.",
      "“The game’s changed massively,” he said. “Strikers don’t touch the ball anymore. Goalkeepers and centre-backs have more touches. It’s all build-up now, everything’s precise. You don’t cross the ball anymore, you don’t put it in behind and compete.”",
      "Even Rooney’s son, currently in Man Utd’s academy, has felt it. “He plays as a No. 9 and said to me, ‘It’s boring.’ I keep saying, ‘No, you’re playing as a nine.’ But they’re just not involved in the game as much now.”",
      "That tactical shift is, for Rooney, a reason why only a few true centre-forwards are emerging at the top level.",
      "“You’ve lost natural number nines. I think Isak, Haaland, and Watkins, probably the three standout ones. Rashford’s doing better now, too. But beyond that? Not many.”",
      "Asked who he’d pick as a manager if he needed one striker right now, Rooney was clear. “Haaland. As good as Isak’s been, I think Haaland’s got everything. He’s not the best at heading, his timing’s a bit off, but the goals he’s scored even this season, with injuries, I’d want him.”",
      "And what of the greats of Rooney’s era?",
      "“I always say Drogba. He could head the ball, hold it up, and he was quick, powerful. You could play off him. That’s the kind of striker I liked.”",
      "He added, “Michael Owen (Liverpool) was unplayable for a few years. Ronaldo, R9, had everything. Alan Shearer, Andy Cole, Owen, Sergio Aguero, Thierry Henry… they were incredible. But Kane, for sustainability and goals scored? He’s right up there.”",

      "Man Utd defender Harry Maguire is one of four Red Devils stars ‘immune’ to their ‘fire sale’ in the summer transfer window, according to reports.",
      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe and INEOS are having a terrible first full season as new Man Utd co-owners with the Red Devils 15th in the Premier League and only three matches remaining.",
      "Their saving grace could be in the Europa League, though, with Ruben Amorim’s side looking likely to qualify for the final after beating Athletic Bilbao 3-0 in the away leg of their semi-final.",
      "Victory in the final, if they get there, would ensure Man Utd will play Champions League football next season and give Ratcliffe and INEOS more room to manoeuvre in the transfer market.",
      "With many of Amorim’s players struggling to buy into his style of play, philosophy and tactics, it’s likely that there will be a big overturn of his existing squad this season.",
      "And now the Daily Star claims that the Man Utd board and Ratcliffe are ‘willing to sell most members of the squad provided the price is right’ this summer.",
      "Kobbie Mainoo, Luke Shaw, Manuel Ugarte, Casemiro, Rasmus Hojlund, Matthijs de Ligt, Joshua Zirkzee and Christian Eriksen are named as players who could be sold in order to satisfy the Premier League’s profit and sustainability rules.",

      "Gallas said: “I think Victor Osimhen can become a star in the Premier League, he has the right profile. He can stretch play and stretch the backlines. Another attacker can run into the space he makes, and he could be useful for any club in the Premier League. He’s always learning, but at the same time, how long will he need to adapt to a new situation?",
      "“We’ve seen foreign players before, it’s often difficult for them in the first season. The second season they step up, so it’s not unusual at all. Even Ronaldo, in his first season he wasn’t the Ronaldo we know now, but in the second season there were signs.",
      "“It all depends which club. If Arsenal need results straight away, they need to win the Premier League next year, then they need one player who can do it straight away. They don’t have time.",

      "There’s no Sol Campbell on here because it happened in the before-times, but here’s a list of every club’s biggest free transfer regret if that’s more your bag.",
      "",
      "10) Youri Tielemans (Leicester City to Aston Villa)\n“From the first day I set foot on this ground, your warmth and passion embraced me. Victory and triumph, love, hope and even defeat,” wrote the Belgian midfielder as he confirmed what we had all long knew: He would leave a relegated Leicester City with an FA Cup winner’s medal and the knowledge that he could have done little more to stop the slide from two consecutive top-five finishes to relegation.",
      "In truth, his final year at Leicester was poor after a failed transfer to Arsenal left him ‘mentally gone’. We expected Arsenal to return when he became available on a free transfer in 2023 – it really did feel like a no-brainer – but it was Aston Villa who won that particular race. “The manager was selling me this idea of playing Champions League and I really bought into it,” said Tielemans, who would be playing in Europe’s elite competition a year later.",
      "After a tricky first season in Villa colours, he has since thrived in the Champions League and Premier League, where he has made a good case for making the Premier League XI of the season.",
      "READ: Alexander-Arnold joins list of every Premier League club’s biggest free transfer exit",
      "",
      "9) Ander Herrera (Manchester United to PSG)\nThe Spanish midfielder was reduced to tears on a Manchester United podcast when discussing his exit from the club: “I got the Player of the Year award by the fans and the club didn’t call me that summer to sign a new contract, and they did with other players. That was painful for me, honestly.”",
      "Herrera won the individual gong on the back of United’s most successful post-Sir Alex Ferguson season, in which he played a key role in their League Cup and Europa League titles, and memorably man-marked Eden Hazard out of a clash with Chelsea in perhaps the defining game of his United career.",
      "But the new contract did not arrive that summer and a lame offer as his deal came to a close was comfortably improved by PSG. “There is red in my heart,” said Herrera as he confirmed his departure.",
      "He ranks pretty high in a (largely awful) list of Manchester United transfers post-Fergie.",
      "",
      "8) Kevin de Bruyne (Manchester City to…)\n“I don’t know about the future unfortunately. I have shown I can still play here, otherwise I don’t do what I do these last four or five weeks,” said Kevin De Bruyne after striking the only goal as Manchester City beat Wolves, taking him to 250 goal involvements under Pep Guardiola.",
      "He has won six Premier Leagues, one Champions League and seven domestic cups (an eighth could come in the FA Cup this month) for City, making him one of the most decorated players in Premier League history.",
      "The Belgian is clearly very upset not to be offered terms by City, meaning his 10-year reign as one of the best midfielders in Premier League history is coming to an end. Or is it? His form in the final weeks of his City stay has prompted some cheeky links with Liverpool, while Aston Villa are said to be very interested.",
      "“Let’s talk about the statue – for me he is Manchester City’s greatest ever player,” said Jamie Carragher. Would the club still build him a statue if he stays in the Premier League? They would probably quite like him to slink over to the semi-retirement of MLS.",
      "",
      "7) Gini Wijnaldum (Liverpool to PSG)\n“What this person – this wonderful, joyful, selfless person – has done for our team and club I cannot sum up in words, in truth, because my English is not good enough,” said Jurgen Klopp as Wijnaldum played his 237th and final game for Liverpool.",
      "The Dutchman had barely stopped running in five years at Anfield which earned him Premier League and Champions League medals, but he fell victim of FSG’s reluctance to hand long contracts to players in their 30s. He wanted to stay and Klopp wanted to keep him – he was ‘perfect’ for Klopp’s system – but a business decision was made.",
      "It seemed that Barcelona would sign Wijnaldum – they are masters of the free transfer swoop – but PSG stepped in to offer twice the money. There he won a French league title but being wonderful, joyful and selfless buttered no parsnips in Paris and he is now in Saudi Arabia playing as a striker.",
      "",
      "6) Emre Can (Liverpool to Juventus)\nIt’s been seven years since we said the free transfer exit of Emre Can from Liverpool should be met with ‘shrugs’, and we were absolutely right. As galling as it always is to allow a player worth £30m-plus to leave for nothing, he was never integral to a Liverpool side building towards Champions League and Premier League glory under Jurgen Klopp.",
      "It helps of course that he was then pretty poor at Juventus (though his career has since been rescued by Borussia Dortmund) while Liverpool brought in Fabinho and immediately won the Champions League. Can was never missed.",
      "",
      "5) Andreas Christensen (Chelsea to Barcelona)\n“Having spent ten amazing years at this club, I felt now was the right time for a new beginning for me and my family,” said the Dane, not so fondly remembered by Chelsea fans after he made himself unavailable to play in the FA Cup final against Liverpool in 2022. The decision to leave had clearly affected the form of a player who had won the Champions League the year before.",
      "There was enmity between club and player at the end, with Christensen blamed for twice reportedly reneging on verbal agreements to sign a new contract. He then engaged new agents who wanted to start the whole process again from scratch.",
      "He won the title with Barcelona in his very first season but has been perpetually linked with a return to the Premier League, with the Spanish club likely to accept slightly less than his £430m buy-out clause.",
      "",
      "4) Antonio Rudiger (Chelsea to Real Madrid)\nIn the same summer that Christensen left, Rudiger also departed Chelsea. And the Blues have been struggling for leadership at the back ever since; they have won nothing since the German left in 2021.",
      "Rudiger admitted that the uncertainty surrounding Chelsea’s ownership and the knock-on effect on player negotiations were a big factor in his exit, saying: “For me, there was a gap between August and January, and that made me think “what’s going on”.",
      "“You get pressure from other teams because it’s January and people don’t know what’s happening and you would have to wait until June because you have a contender to take over the club but even today you cannot talk to him because you have to go through Government stuff and everything.",
      "“I didn’t want to wait until June to sort out my future because it’s been almost a year of uncertainty.”",
      "And nobody can begrudge anybody joining Real Madrid, right?",
      "",
      "3) Aaron Ramsey (Arsenal to Juventus)\n“It all happened…I agreed to a contract they proposed,” said Ramsey when attempting to explain why he had left Arsenal after 11 years at the club. He claims that the offer was then retracted as manager Unai Emery decided he wanted to take the club in a different direction.",
      "A few months later Emery was sacked by Arsenal and Ramsey has signed a deal with Juventus that gave him the highest basic salary of any British footballer. But there were few regrets from Arsenal as he never started more than 13 Serie A games in a season for the Italian giants (though he did win a Serie A title) before a loan spell at Rangers and a permanent exit to Nice and then Cardiff.",
      "",
      "2) Paul Pogba (Manchester United to Juventus)\nOnly Manchester United could twice spend money on a mercurial talent and twice watch him walk away for nothing.",
      "‘For a boy that joined the academy at 16 to make over 200 United appearances and lift the Youth Cup, along with two major pieces of silverware, is something that should be applauded and celebrated,’ said Manchester United in a statement that somehow missed out the details of Pogba being allowed to walk away for nothing, re-join for £89m and then leave for nothing again six years later.",
      "Relations between Pogba and the club had long since broken down but the second that Jose Mourinho referred to Pogba as a “virus” should have been the second they began plans to sell him and recoup some of their costs.",
      "He later said that he wanted to leave in the summer of 2019 after his best season for Manchester United because he saw the writing on the wall about the direction of travel but the club denied him an exit; they would live to regret their reticence.",
      "",
      "1) Trent Alexander-Arnold (Liverpool to, we presume, Real Madrid)\nOnly perhaps Kylian Mbappe and Lionel Messi have been more valuable free transfers. He has chosen adventure over comfort after winning everything at Liverpool.",
      "Joe Cole has discussed the best position for Trent Alexander-Arnold at Real Madrid, after listing off four players he will not get in the team ahead of.",
      "Former Liverpool man John Aldridge has warned Trent Alexander-Arnold he’s “going to get annihilated” often when he moves to Real Madrid.",
      "Chelsea will be busy in the ‘exceptional’ early transfer window added for Club World Cup signings, with Liverpool, Arsenal and Manchester United affected.",
      "Are Liverpool fans so upset about Trent Alexander-Arnold because it reminds them that this actually does not mean more? Plus, some Inter v Barcelona…",
      "Real Madrid are ready to pay for Trent’s early signing, but Tuchel’s refusal to release players could cause him to miss the Club World Cup.",
      "Real Madrid are reportedly looking to get Trent Alexander-Arnold out of his Liverpool contract early in order for him to play at the FIFA Club World Cup."

      "",

      "",
      "5) Dean Henderson (Crystal Palace): +2.5\nWas doing incredibly well until he conceded 10 goals in two games against Manchester City and Newcastle United. Redeemed himself with a clean sheet v Bournemouth.",
      "",
      "6) Lukasz Fabianski (West Ham): +2.3\nMade eight saves to protect a point v Bournemouth as the old man proved he’s still got what it takes. Was excellent v Brighton, particularly to save a deflected effort from Yasin Ayari, and then made a series of saves v Southampton before being stretchered off with a head injury. Returned to over-concede v Fulham but he was at least on the winning side. He under-conceded v Palace and lost. Now on the West Ham bench.",

      "7) Robert Sanchez (Chelsea): +1.6\nHas the best save percentage in the Premier League but still gets pelters from pundits.",

      "Premier League clubs received a total of £2.84billion last season, which was comprised of six payments through the division’s ‘central revenue system’, something the Premier League says ‘ensures the most equitable distribution of funds of any major European league’.",
      "Manchester City were paid £175.9m as champions – just short of their own record £176.2m in 2022/23 – while runners-up Arsenal benefited from having the most games televised and were given £175.5m. They would have broken the record had they won the title.",

All 20 clubs automatically receive around £95m through an equal share distributed based on both the domestic (£31.2m in 2023/24) and international (£55.7m in 2023/24) broadcast deals – those TV rights are lucrative for a reason – as well as £8.2m each from central commercial revenue streams.",

      "For the 2023/24 season, the difference in prize money was around £2.8m per position. Sheffield United were awarded as much for finishing bottom, all the way up to champions Manchester City receiving £56.4m. It basically helped pay for 95.6% of Omar Marmoush.",

Everton’s prize money after finishing 15th last season was £132.2m, more than the three clubs immediately above them – Wolves (£130m in 14th), Fulham (£128.6m in 13th) and Bournemouth (£131.5m) – as the Toffees were picked for far more live TV games. Their UK facility fee payment of £20.2m was the seventh highest in the league alongside Newcastle, and higher than fourth-placed Aston Villa’s (£19.4m).",

      "Man Utd have been linked with a move for Brentford winger Bryan Mbeumo along with Wolves forward Matheus Cunha ahead of the summer transfer window.",
      "The Red Devils have had a miserable season in the Premier League with Ruben Amorim’s side currently 15th heading into the final three matches of the campaign.",
      "Amorim’s men are already guaranteed to finish the season as the worst Man Utd team to have played in the Premier League, even if they win their remaining three fixtures.",
      "One of their main issues this season has been scoring goals with just five Premier League sides scoring fewer than them this term.",
      "Rasmus Hojlund and Joshua Zirkzee have come in for lots of criticism this season with the duo only scoring seven Premier League goals between them this term.",
      "Amorim has struggled to get the best out of his group with the Man Utd squad struggling to adapt to his style of play, formation and philosophy.",
      "And now Man Utd want to support him in the transfer window with a number of signings and one of the main areas they want to improve is in attack.",
      "On Sunday, the Daily Telegraph reported that Brentford winger Mbeumo is now a ‘target’ for Man Utd ‘as well as’ Wolves Cunha as they look to overhaul their front line.",
      "The Brentford man is ‘high on list of potential targets as Amorim looks to bolster squad’ and Man Utd are ‘ready to join the race’ for Mbeumo ‘when competition for the £60 million-rated Brentford forward intensifies during the summer transfer window’.",
      "The report added:",
      "‘Wolves striker Matheus Cunha, who has a £65 million buyout clause, is a target for United in the summer but has been most effective through the middle as a No 9.",
      "‘Interest in Mbeumo is independent of the Cunha deal, with the former Troyes forward regarded as one of the best wide forwards in the Premier League.’",
      "But transfer expert Fabrizio Romano is less sure of how serious the Red Devils’ interest in Mbeumo is with “many clubs” looking to tie up a deal to sign the Brentford forward in the summer transfer window.",
      "Romano wrote in his GiveMeSport newsletter: “As far as I know, the main target remains Cunha. For Mbeumo there will be many clubs involved, so it’s an open race.”",
      "Brentford boss Thomas Frank recently admitted that Brentford are a “selling club” but that he wants to keep Mbeumo and his other top stars “forever”.",
      "Frank said: “I’m the head coach, I want my best players to stay forever. I know that Bryan is very happy being here at Brentford, he’s thriving, doing well and playing fantastic. What happens in the future? I don’t know. I’ve said many times: we are a selling club.",
      "“But at the same time we have to reinforce that there are 10 clubs in the world who aren’t selling clubs. So, of course, if the right price – and that’s going to be expensive – is coming, then I’m sure the club will be open for it. But I’m very happy he’s here, and I’m convinced that Bryan will still be happy playing football here.”",
      "Liverpool and Newcastle have been given fresh hope in their pursuit of a ‘£50million’ rated Premier League forward, with the selling club open to bids.",
      "Super agent Jorge Mendes could complicate Manchester United’s summer move for Wolves attacker Matheus Cunha, according to reports.",
      "The amount of money it would take for Man Utd to buy Wolves forward Matheus Cunha “could be an issue” ahead of the summer transfer window.",
      "Paul Scholes has two concerns over the imminent Man Utd signing and claims nothing can save what has been a “disaster” of a season for the club.",
      "Even Matheus Cunha can’t flop at Manchester United… right? He is ridiculously good and Wolves have won six in a row. It’s F365’s 3pm Blackout…",
      "Ruben Amorim hinted that Man Utd are ready to move early in the transfer window, insisting players want to come as he addressed links to Matheus Cunha."

      "Transfer guru Fabrizio Romano says there is a “clear feeling” that Christopher Nkunku will “leave Chelsea in the summer transfer window.”",
      "Speaking on his YouTube channel, Romano revealed that Nkunku was a genuine candidate to leave in January.",
      "However, a move never came close due to Chelsea’s reluctance to accept a loan and the player’s preference for a permanent deal.",
      "“There was a possibility for Christopher Nkunku to go on a permanent transfer in January,” Romano said. “Then all the approaches were for a loan deal, and Nkunku was not keen for a loan. Same for the club.”",
      "Romano also revealed that Man Utd, managed by Ruben Amorim, explored a potential swap deal during the winter window, but talks never progressed.",
      "“There was some interest from Bayern in January, some interest also from Manchester United, but only in case of a swap deal, and nothing happened,” he said.",
      "With Chelsea now under Enzo Maresca and preparing for another summer overhaul, Romano believes there’s now a clear path for Nkunku to depart.",
      "Surprise reports linking him with a move to champions Liverpool emerged last week.",
      "“The story for Christopher Nkunku will be different [this summer]… the clear feeling of all parties involved is for Christopher Nkunku to leave Chelsea in the summer transfer window,” he said.",
      "Nkunku, who joined from RB Leipzig in 2023 for over £50m, has struggled to find form or fitness since arriving in West London. Having missed large chunks of his first season at the club, the Frenchman has struggled to find regular minutes this term, scoring just three goals in 27 Premier League appearances.",

      "“Nkunku is not finding the space he wants,” Romano explained.",
      "“Also, probably in terms of skills, Nkunku is not exactly the kind of player needed for Enzo Maresca’s vision and idea. Nkunku wants to play on a regular basis, and at Chelsea, this is not happening.",
      "“Apart from the Conference League. But it’s about Premier League football, the crucial games, and Nkunku wants to play.”",
      "Romano also confirmed Nkunku has picked up yet another injury and will miss the next 10 to 15 days, further fuelling expectations of a summer exit.",
      "“My expectation is not to see Christopher Nkunku in a Chelsea shirt next season.",
      "“I told you that in March and in April, and I confirm that also now in May.”",
      "Chelsea are understood to be open to offers and would prefer a permanent transfer over another season of uncertainty. Clubs in Germany, Italy and Spain are also said to be monitoring the situation.",
      "It remains to be seen if Utd are open to returning for Nkunku when the window opens on June 1, but their January preference for a swap deal hints at the financial restrictions the club may have to work around.",

      "17) CG Egan-Riley (Burnley)\nA mainstay of one of the meanest defences in Championship history, he will surely stay for a Premier League campaign.",
      "",
      "16) Neymar (Santos)\nHe’s back in Brazil after his contract in Saudi Arabia was terminated. His idea is to get fit and then return to Europe; Santos’ idea is to milk this for all it’s worth and persuade him to stay until the World Cup in 2026.",
      "",

      "9) Angel Gomes (Lille)\nThe Lee Carsley England call-up has been linked with a free transfer move back to England but West Ham do not appeal. There has been talk of Roma.",

      "",
      "5) Frank Anguissa (Napoli)\nHaving been a regular for Napoli in the two seasons since he joined, Anguissa might expect his terms to be extended. But it also might depend on the mood of Antonio Conte on any given day. Both Manchester City and United have been linked.",

      "2) Jonathan David (Lille)\nWould have been an excellent signing for Manchester United but somehow remains at Lille despite being one of the top scorers of 2024. Could he sign for Manchester City as an Erling Haaland back-up? Or could he be the missing striker link at Arsenal or Liverpool?",

      "Trent Alexander-Arnold will leave Liverpool when his contract expires at the end of the season, reportedly for Real Madrid. As you can imagine, the Anfield faithful have reacted in a completely normal way and they wish their academy graduate – who has won everything with them – nothing but the best.",
      "There have been some huge players walk on a Bosman over the years and Alexander-Arnold is arguably the biggest ever to depart a Premier League club.",
      "We have picked the biggest free transfer exit for each of the 20 Premier League sides.",
      "",
      "Arsenal: Aaron Ramsey\nIf we did not restrict it to Bosman transfers, there would be a plethora of options for Arsenal. Mesut Ozil, ex-captain Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang and club-record signing at the time Nicolas Pepe all had their contracts terminated, but did not leave on a Jean-Marc.",
      "Ramsey leaving was disappointing but nobody could blame him; the wages Juventus offered him were extraordinary and only a fool would have said no, especially taking into account it is a huge European club he was joining. It’s a shame it didn’t work a hero in two FA Cup finals.",
      "",
      "Aston Villa: Thomas Hitzlsperger\nRon Vlaar, Brad Friedel, Nigel Reo-Coker and Mark Bosnich were all considered but a wise man once told me, ‘If in doubt, go for Der Hammer’.",
      "The midfielder returned to Germany with Stuttgart following the expiry of his Villa contract in 2005. He did come back to England, signing for West Ham in July 2010 and spending the majority of 2012/13 at Everton.",
      "",
      "Bournemouth: Jefferson Lerma\nLloyd Kelly might have prevailed through recency bias but Lerma’s departure was hardly ideal for Bournemouth in their preparation for returning to the top flight.",
      "He was a linchpin in the Cherries midfield and has been an inspirational free transfer signing for Crystal Palace.",
      "MORE: Every Premier League club’s best free transfer signing EVER",
      "",
      "Brentford: Christian Eriksen\nIt doesn’t matter that there are barely any options for Brentford because Eriksen is the clear winner.",
      "The ex-Tottenham Hotspur playmaker had to leave Serie A after his cardiac arrest at Euro 2020 and Brentford offered him a return to the Premier League, which was perfect in every way. The large Danish contingent would have helped Eriksen settle back into a competitive setting and the Bees were nowhere near bad enough for Eriksen to snub them and not good enough for there to be any chance of making him look out of his depth.",
      "Despite wanting to keep him beyond the six-month contract he signed in January 2022, Brentford could not convince Eriksen to sign and the midfielder went to Manchester United.",
      "",
      "Brighton: Jose Izquierdo\nEnock Mwepu obviously does not count but is worth a mention considering the horrendous circumstances that ended his career while at Brighton.",
      "Albion were a tricky one but we are pretty content with Izquierdo’s inclusion. What a throwback that is, by the way.",
      "Davy Propper was originally our first choice but no Bosman means no inclusion. It threw a spanner in the works when it became clear he was still under contract when he left.",
      "",
      "Chelsea: Antonio Rudiger\nThiago Silva, Andreas Christensen, Willian, Joe Cole, Michael Ballack, N’Golo Kante, Hernan Crespo, Nicolas Anelka, Andriy Shevchenko… Chelsea are comfortably the club with the most options.",
      "Losing a prime Antonio Rudiger would have stung though. The German centre-back spent five years at Stamford Bridge before being snapped up by Real Madrid for nothing.",
      "",
      "Crystal Palace: Wilfried Zaha\nNo contest here. Zaha is Palace’s greatest player of all time. He left when his contract expired in the summer of 2023, joining Turkish giants Galatasaray in an ambitious move for Champions League football.",
      "After years of transfer stories linking him with a move to Arsenal, Zaha could not shine in Turkey and was loaned out to French side Lyon after a season. That did not go to plan either and he is now playing under Dean Smith for Charlotte FC in MLS.",
      "",
      "Everton: Wayne Rooney\nObviously not the first time because that was for a transfer fee, but the second time Rooney left Everton is probably their most significant Bosman loss of the Premier League era.",
      "Rooney scored an impressive ten goals in 30 league matches in 2017/18. Not only was his Goodison Park exit felt, but his arrival in the United States to play for D.C. United was as well. He would later go on to manage the MLS side for 453 days.",
      "",
      "Fulham: Tosin Adarabioyo\nFulham screwed the pooch by letting Moussa Dembele join Celtic but that is more of a regret than a big transfer. Tosin Adarabioyo left the Cottagers for west London rivals Chelsea last summer in his prime years. It was gutting for Marco Silva but they have done just fine with Joachim Andersen returning as his replacement.",
      "",
      "Ipswich: Sylvain Legwinski\nIt was always going to be difficult to find someone Ipswich regretfully released while they were a Premier League club and it turns out there was literally nobody worth mentioning. As a result, we have copped out and picked the player with the highest market value on Transfermarkt to leave the Tractor Boys for nothing. That man is Sylvain Legwinski, who departed after the 2007/08 campaign and did not find a club until the following April before spending a few months at St. Neots Town.",
      "",
      "Leicester: Youri Tielemans\nCaglar Soyuncu was an unfortunate loss but nothing comes close to Tielemans’ exit at the end of the 2022/23 campaign.",
      "The Belgian left as a club legend after his FA Cup final winner in 2021. He was linked with Arsenal for bloody ages but ended up joining Aston Villa. After a difficult first year under Unai Emery, Tielemans is back to being one of the best midfielders in the Premier League.",
      "",
      "Liverpool: Trent Alexander-Arnold\n“Giving everything day in, day out for 20 years, I’ve got to a point now where I feel like I need a new change, a new challenge for me as a player and as a person. And I think now is the right time for me to do that.”",
      "Alexander-Arnold’s Liverpool departure has been confirmed and while there was no mention of Real Madrid in the club statement, we all know he is moving to the Spanish capital.",
      "This is a huge loss for Liverpool but from the outside looking in, it’s hard to blame Alexander-Arnold for wanting to spread his wings and challenge for the Ballon d’Or with the biggest club in the world. Good luck to him.",
      "",
      "Manchester City: Ilkay Gundogan\nApologies for snubbing Sergio Aguero and Pep Guardiola’s ‘we cannoh replace him’ crocodile tears, but Gundogan is an easy choice. Alongside Erling Haaland, he was probably City’s most important player in their Treble-winning 2022/23 campaign, with his last job as City captain being to lift the Champions League trophy.",
      "The German returned after a year at Barcelona but he isn’t as good anymore. We thought he would be fantastic as well…",
      "In terms of successful free transfer signings, James Milner’s move from City to Liverpool is certainly up there, but that is not what we are looking at so I will shut up.",
      "",
      "Manchester United: Paul Pogba\nThe difficult years that followed Peter Schmeichel’s departure in 1999 make him worth an honourable mention at least, but the fact Pogba left on a free transfer twice shades it for him.",
      "Pogba’s time at Manchester United was riddled with discourse. On His Day, he was a world beater. Unfortunately for the Red Devils, he was pretty much only ever On His Day for France.",
      "The best part of it all is obviously that Man United let Pogba join Juventus for nothing in 2012, re-signed him for a world-record £89million four years later, then let him join Juventus for nothing AGAIN in 2022.",
      "United giving him a fat new contract and then losing him to that doping ban might have been overkill, even for them.",
      "",
      "Newcastle: Jonas Gutierrez\nGutierrez’s exit in 2015 was emblematic of what Newcastle were under Mike Ashley’s ownership. The Argentine kept the Magpies in the Premier League after returning to the team following a bout with cancer and ended up being released over the phone by John Carver.",
      "“John Carver rang me and told me the club weren’t going to offer me a new deal,” Ryan Taylor said at the time. “Then he asked me to pass the phone to Jonas, which was unbelievable… I can’t really blame John because he’s under instructions on what to do.”",
      "Classy.",
      "",
      "Nottingham Forest: Stuart Pearce\nDespite all the fuss surrounding his arrival, Jesse Lingard was nowhere near good enough to be Forest’s pick, was he?",
      "Psycho was a fair bit older than Lingard but desperate times lead to desperate measures. After spending 12 years at the club, Pearce walked on a Bosman in 1997.",
      "It was a difficult final season for Pearce, who assumed caretaker player-manager duty following Frank Clark’s resignation. The role was eventually shared with Dave Bassett but Forest went down and a 35-year-old Pearce wanted out, joining Newcastle United.",
      "",
      "Southampton: Stuart Armstrong\nWe got a bit stuck. This always happens with our one-per-club features.",
      "",
      "Tottenham Hotspur: Sol Campbell\nThe most famous free transfer in Premier League history. Your Fabrizio Romanos of today would have got in there before Big Sol could rock up for a press conference announcing his astonishing transfer from Spurs to Arsenal in 2001, which left everyone and their nan absolutely shook.",
      "Campbell had previously told fans he was staying but turned down the chance to become Spurs’ highest-paid player to fulfil his dream of playing in the Champions League. There was nothing to indicate Arsenal were even in contention for his signature but stunned journalists witnessed the sensational and iconic unveiling.",

      "West Ham: Ben Johnson\nIt is surprising how rubbish the options for West Ham are. If you have any better suggestions, we are all for hearing them.",
      "Our logic is simple: London lad, been at the club since the age of seven, but most importantly in modern times, was someone the Hammers could have sold for pure profit. Opportunity. Missed.",
      "",
      "Wolves: Adama Traore\nAdama’s future was a talking point for bloody ages. Spurs were in the mix for a while and many anticipated a move to a big club when his Wolves contract expired in 2023. Alas, he signed for Fulham.",

      "It’s lovely to see Shaw back to full fitness and just as Chelsea have done successfully (touch wood) with Reece James, the Red Devils will have to manage his fitness very carefully. Ruben Amorim rotated heavily – as expected – for their inconvenient Premier League match sandwiched between their Europa League semi-final legs against Athletic Bilbao and that gave Shaw the opportunity to make his second league start in a row.",

      "The 3-1 defeat at Chelsea will do little to trouble Liverpool as they celebrated their deserved title. But if anyone was questioning what Arne Slot's side may have looked like with a few injuries, then that performance was it.",
      "There were probably some party-related reasons for Liverpool's flat performance and a lower intensity than normal, but Arne Slot wanted to use these final four games to help him plan for the summer. Those he brought into the team at Stamford Bridge failed to impress.",
      "The entire midfield was changed and the trio of Wataru Endo, Curtis Jones and Harvey Elliott could not cope with their Chelsea counterparts, notably Romeo Lavia and Cole Palmer who ran the show.",
      "Jones slipped in the build-up to Chelsea's first, Elliott was hauled off after the Blues' second - and Endo showed he, at 32, will struggle to replicate what Ryan Gravenberch did brilliantly all season.",
      "At the top end of the pitch, Diogo Jota was anonymous with just 13 touches - he has one league goal in 2025 - while Darwin Nunez missed two good openings after coming on. At least he managed one more touch than Jota.",
      "None had a worse outing though than Jarell Quansah, with one own goal and one penalty conceded in a disappointing and unconvincing display at centre-half, one that was reminiscent of his opening-day struggles at Ipswich.",
      "Liverpool will not stand still this summer and rest on their laurels. The club want to be busy in the transfer market and strengthen their squad to compete again next season and develop the next title-winning team.",
      "And with Kostas Tsimikas failing to ease Liverpool's left-back woes, that looks like four areas Liverpool could strengthen this summer. Left-back, centre-back, midfield and striker - and don't forget a right-back if Trent Alexander-Arnold departs, as expected.Sam Blitz",
      "Bilbao or bust has been the mantra at Manchester United for some time. Watching them fall to a 16th league defeat of the season as they lost 4-3 at Brentford, their most for 35 years, made that abundantly clear. But there is something more behind their struggles.",
      "Ruben Amorim named the third-youngest team in Premier League history at Brentford. Considering United's recent domestic form, and the eight changes made after Thursday's win over Athletic Club, defeat was almost inevitable, strange as that sounds.",
      "Everything, understandably, is focused on the Europa League. That doesn't answer the question of why United, the only undefeated side in European competition, haven't beaten a team that will be playing top-flight football next season since January 26.",
      "Since that 1-0 win at Fulham, sealed thanks to Lisandro Martinez's deflected strike, United have played 10 teams outside the bottom three and failed to win against any of them. They still had a round left of the Europa League league phase after that win.",
      "Meanwhile, in Europe United have overcome Real Sociedad and Lyon. Barring a shock collapse, not something you would put past this group, you can add Athletic Club to that list. Then they are one game from a European trophy. Puzzling.",
      "The defeat at Brentford, although not the fairest game to draw conclusions from, served up a perfect example of the problems plaguing Amorim in the Premier League: United were simply unable to cope with Brentford's physicality, pace and direct football.",
      "Regardless of who was picked, as this season has shown us, those same vulnerabilities would remain.",
      "Amorim has inherited a squad ill-equipped to cope with the rigours of English football. Those squad-building missteps must be corrected this summer, particularly if Champions League qualification is secured, otherwise Amorim will see no improvement.Zinny Boswell",
      "Alexander Isak must have felt like his moment would never come in Newcastle's 1-1 draw at Brighton. Twice he had picked up the ball thinking he was about to have a free shot at goal from 12 yards after referee Craig Pawson had pointed to the spot. VAR ruined Newcastle's fun by spotting two incorrect calls from Pawson so it was looking like one of those days for Isak and his team.",
      "But one more chance would come on 89 minutes when Pawson finally correctly spotted a legitimate penalty and Isak was in no mood to pass it up.",
      "In scoring he became the first Newcastle United player to score 23 goals in a Premier League season since Alan Shearer in 2002 and now has 22 goals in his last 26 league appearances. There is still time to catch Mohamed Salah in the Golden Boot race, too. He is five back with three games to play and Salah has only scored once in his last six Premier League games. Stranger things have happened.Lewis Jones",
      "There have been calls from some sections of the Brighton fans for goalkeeper Bart Verbruggen to be replaced.",
      "Before the 1-1 draw with Newcastle, the Seagulls had conceded at least twice in each of their last six Premier League games and shipped 24 goals in their previous 11 league encounters. Verbruggen was not solely to blame but his lack of confidence and authority has not been helping his defenders. Brighton also have the worst save ratio in the Premier League this season (59.6 per cent).",
      "However, Verbruggen put in his best performance of 2025 to repel Newcastle. Solid from set-pieces and looking much more composed under pressure, Verbruggen made four saves - the pick of which came in stoppage time to deny Callum Wilson a winning goal. If he can stay in this kind of form, Brighton's defensive process and numbers should be back on the improve.Lewis Jones",
      "Ange Postecoglou's wholesale changes in Tottenham's 1-1 draw at West Ham allowed those brought in to put forward their case to start in Thursday's Europa League semi-final second leg at Bodo/Glimt - and Mathys Tel took it.",
      "The French forward was Spurs' most dangerous player at the London Stadium as he assisted Wilson Odobert's opener after pressing West Ham defender Max Kilman into a mistake.",
      "Tel attempted eight dribbles - the most of any player in the game - and had two shots, with only Jarrod Bowen having more.",
      "It was another promising display from the on-loan Bayern Munich man, who is finding his feet out on the left wing for Spurs, with Postecoglou praising the 20-year-old in his post-match press conference.",
      "He said: \"He's taken in the information and he understands the role now a little bit better, especially out on the left.",
      "\"These last few weeks, we've obviously had Sonny [Heung-Min Son] out. We've needed him to fill that void and I think he's done that job well.\"",
      "If Tel were to start in Norway on Thursday, then it would be well deserved. And with more performances like this, Spurs will be keen to activate the £45m option to sign him permanently from Bayern.Declan Olley",
      "It took Michael Kayode just under three months to make his first start for Brentford after joining on loan from Fiorentina in January. Before then, there were fleeting glimpses of what he had to offer; eye-catching cameos that provided a taste of what was to come.",
      "But he has started at right-back in the Bees' last three games and been a key part of the team that has won three in a row for the first time since a run between October 21 and November 4 2023.",
      "The 20-year-old looked eager to get forward from the very start during Man Utd's visit to the Gtech and his boundless energy caused Amorim's side problems - as did his monstrous throw-ins, as shown in the lead-up to Luke Shaw's own goal.",
      "Kayode completed the most dribbles (5) in the match, won the most duels (10) and finished with a 97 per cent pass accuracy, the most of any player to play 45 minutes or more. \"He looked like he just enjoyed playing football,\" said Thomas Frank afterwards.",
      "There is surely no doubt Brentford will take up the option to make Kayode's stay in west London permanent at the end of the season.Dan Long",
      "If ever there was to be a day when things finally clicked into place for West Ham under Graham Potter, the visit of rivals Tottenham to the London Stadium was surely it.",
      "The Hammers had a week to prepare for the London derby, a luxury compared to Spurs' 64-hour turnaround from Thursday's Europa League semi-final against Bodo-Glimt.",
      "Spurs had more than an eye on Thursday's return leg in Norway, Postecoglou's eight pre-match alterations made that clear, so opportunity knocked for Potter's beleaguered Hammers to end a seven-game wait for a victory.",
      "Before a ball had been kicked, frustration summed up the mood among a fanbase who had not seen a victory since late February, but that turned to apathy come full-time.",
      "Hoards headed for an early exit despite the scoreboard reading 1-1 with the prospect of a late derby victory still on the table.",
      "The fact that was not enough to keep sections of the disgruntled fanbase in their seats shows just how deep West Ham's rut is with three games left to salvage something from this season.Jack Wilkinson"

      "Monday 5 May 2025 12:52, UK",
      "Ruben Amorim says Manchester United are not ready to be competitive in the Premier League and Champions League next season.",
      "United racked up their 16th defeat of the league season, their most for 35 years, with the 4-3 loss at European hopefuls Brentford, a result that mathematically consigns them to a bottom-half finish.",
      "Amorim, who made eight changes and named the third-youngest side in Premier League history, was prioritising Thursday's Europa League semi-final second leg against Athletic Club, with United 3-0 up on aggregate.",
      "Since Amorim took charge of United on November 11, only the now-relegated sides Ipswich (3), Leicester (3), and Southampton (1) have won fewer Premier League games than United (6).",
      "United will be playing Champions League football next season if they can win the Europa League, but Amorim says that is a \"real dilemma\" for the club.",
      "\"We know that, but we need to win, and we need to fight to win this competition, to give something to our fans, and to go to the Champions League.",
      "\"Then we will have time to prepare the team to cope with those two competitions. So, it is a dilemma, but we want to win, of course.\"",
      "United were trailing 4-1 with eight minutes to go at Brentford, but late goals from Alejandro Garnacho and substitute Amad Diallo restored some respectability for Amorim's struggling side.",
      "There were flashes of promise, particularly Mason Mount's opener, his first league goal for 13 months, but the performance, for the most part, stood in stark contrast to Thursday's impressive 3-0 win over Athletic Club.",
      "Amorim has failed to translate United's Europa League form into consistent performances and results in the Premier League, but insists he is seeing signs of progress.",
      "He added: \"I have no doubts that we are playing better, and we are understanding the way we play, even in this context. So, we have to take all the hits.",
      "\"We are losing games in the Premier League, we are fighting for the Europa League, so we need to accept that and to think about Thursday as the most important game for us.\"",
      "Asked about the goal for Mount, who has endured another season blighted by injuries, Amorim added: \"It's not just the finish, it's the position that he has on the pitch. He's like a third midfielder that can reach the box. He's really intelligent.",
      "\"He's getting there and he trains really hard. Sometimes I have to push him back and to take him off the pitch because he wants to do so much more. We are taking care of him.",
      "\"He wants to play more minutes, but the minutes were controlled. I'm really happy with him.\"",
      "Striker Chido Obi became the youngest player in United's history to start a Premier League game at Brentford, aged 17 years and 156 days, as fellow academy graduates Harry Amass and Tyler Fredricson also got the nod.",
      "Amorim was pleased with the young trio and the experience they gained, but sent a clear message to them that United's standards in their worst season in the Premier League era would not be accepted moving forward.",
      "\"It is really important to understand that we cannot do this anymore,\" he said, when asked about how important it was for the young players to learn from the defeat.",
      "\"We know the context, but this kind of season we need to change. They need to understand what it is to play for Manchester United.",
      "\"I think they did really well. They [have] not [been] playing so much, but then they have to play 90 minutes because we have to change some other players to save them for Thursday.\"",
      "Asked about the experience they would have gained, Amorim: \"It's really important because you can train a lot with the first team, but to have that feeling, playing with the players, feeling the players, the speed of the game, I think it is the best thing.\"",
      "Obi, on his first senior start, was tasked with leading the line against Brentford's physical centre-back pairing of Nathan Collins and Sepp van den Berg, whose last-minute block denied a goalbound strike from the teenage striker.",
      "The Denmark U21 international had a frustrating full debut until that moment, when he burst through a challenge in the box, and looked destined to at least test Brentford goalkeeper Mark Flekken but for Van den Berg's intervention.",
      "\"Chido fought for all game, but you can feel that he's really naive sometimes in the way he puts his body,\" Amorim said. \"He's going to understand what is the feeling of playing in these games. This is the best way.\""

      "There was a brief boost when Mason Mount slid Alejandro Garnacho's cross home against the run of play, but the Bees deservedly levelled when Mikkel Damsgaard poked a shot that hit the unfortunate Shaw, then Bayindir, then the net.",
      "Within five minutes, the turnaround was complete. Man Utd switched off, wanting play to be paused when Matthijs de Ligt went down with a leg injury after a tangle with Yoane Wissa, but referee Anthony Taylor played on, so Christian Norgaard was able to pick out Kevin Schade to head home.",
      "Only a last-ditch save from Bayindir to keep out Norgaard's connection on Damsgaard's free-kick prevented it becoming three before the break.",
      "United started the second half well, but found themselves further behind when Schade headed in a peach of a cross from Bryan Mbeumo, before the impressive Michael Kayode squared for Wissa to roll home and make it 4-1, with the goal confirmed after a VAR review.",
      "Garnacho hit a stunner from the edge of the box, before Amad's strike deflected off Sepp van den Berg to make it 4-3 and set up a tense finale, but Brentford held on for their third win in succession as their positive end to the campaign continues.",

      "\"We try to go for that win. Sometimes we win, sometimes we lose, but we really, really, really believe it every single time. The players are fantastic. It is a fantastic group to work with.",
      "\"We spoke about it [Europe] before the Brighton game. I rarely say that to the players as it's more about performance, but [I said] this game, we need to win. We have to win this if we want to be in with any chance of maybe having a dream about Europe. And the players did that, big credit to them.",

      "Our betting expert Jones Knows unleashes his insight and angles across the Premier League and thinks Liverpool are a juicy price to beat Chelsea.",
      "It's always worth keeping the player shots lines on your mind against Brentford as their style of play does tend to a high volume of shots conceded. Only Southampton have faced more shots this season than the Bees (588).",
      "This brings forward the case to back Manuel Ugarte to have two or more shots at 9/4 with Sky Bet.",
      "Which Premier League teams will qualify for Europe?",
      "Not known for his shots volume, the midfielder has come to life in that regard under Ruben Amorim, averaging 1.9 shots per 90 across his last 13 appearances. Those backing his two or more shots line have copped a return on six of those occasions.",
      "If the Tottenham that showed up in midweek against Bodo/Glimt does so again - a team full of aggression, creative spark and defensive focus - then West Ham are here for the taking.",
      "However, it's likely that we're going to see the Spurs side that have taken just 16 points away from home this season in the Premier League, losing 10 times. It wouldn't surprise me to see any of three match outcomes here. Great help, I know.",
      "A better angle is in the Tottenham player fouls market where Ben Davies stands out at 7/4 with Sky Bet to make two or more fouls.",
      "West Ham's tricky trio of Jarrod Bowen, Mohamed Kudus and Lucas Paqueta are foul drawing kings.",
      "The last 33 centre backs to have played against West Ham under Graham Potter have made 38 fouls between them with 25 of those 33 making at least one foul. Davies is showing clear signs of decline, making five fouls in his last four starts and is likely to be exposed at some point.",
      "Brighton remain a team to fade, especially against such a relentless and well coached side like Newcastle with a goal in their sights. The Seagulls have conceded at least twice in each of their last six Premier League games and shipped 24 goals in their last 11 league encounters.",
      "These poor returns certainly marry up with my opinion that Fabian Hurzeler is struggling to get the best out of this talented squad.",
      "Newcastle have scored two or more goals in six of their last seven matches and sometimes the obvious bet is the best bet.",
      "Therefore, Alexander Isak to score in a Newcastle win looks a great bet to attack at 9/4 with Sky Bet.",
      "This time of year always brings about big decisions for punters - which teams are overpriced based on a perceived lack of motivation? If Liverpool were going for the title there would be no way you'd be getting 21/10 with Sky Bet on an away win. But the 'week on the beers' theory is certainly affecting their price - wrongly in my opinion, so Liverpool have to be the bet.",
      "Also, Mohamed Salah is a man completely motivated by numbers and breaking records.",
      "He is just two goals away from breaking the record for goal involvements for the season currently held jointly held by Andy Cole and Alan Shearer (47). The Egyptian looks a fine bet to add to his tally of 28 goals and 18 assists by grabbing another goal involvement in a win for Arne Slot's machine team. Salah to score or assist and Liverpool to win can be combined through the BuildABet function to generate an 11/4 shot with Sky Bet.",
      "Nottingham Forest's season has been built around the magnificent trio of Nikola Milenkovic, Murillo and Matz Sels.",
      "But just like when forwards lose their form in front of goal that in turn affects the output of a team, the same can happen in defence and that's occurring with Forest. Mistakes are now being made at key moments in matches and Forest's defensive numbers are now that of a mid-table team.",
      "Across their last 12 Premier League matches their expected goals against process is working at 1.77 per 90 - only Leicester, Ipswich and Southampton have a worse defensive process.",
      "This is seriously worrying for Forest and their hopes of Champions League.",
      "And it makes them impossible to fancy up against such a dangerous and powerful Crystal Palace attack, where Eberechi Eze is sparkling once again. He is 4/1 with Sky Bet to score for a third game in a row. That's generous.",
