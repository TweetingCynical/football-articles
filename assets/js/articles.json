      "Aston Villa have confirmed they have complained to the PGMOL in the face of their controversial defeat to Manchester United. Morgan Rogers' goal was ruled out by the referee, with referee Thomas Bramall blowing up for a foul on goalkeeper Altay Bayindir.",
      "The Red Devils eventually went on to win 2-0. It was a result that saw Villa miss out on a place in the Champions League. They eventually finished sixth in the Premier League.",
      "It was suggested that Villa were set to make their anger known to the referees' governing body, the PGMOL. And that has now been confirmed by Unai Emery's side.",
      "A statement from the Midlands side read: \"Aston Villa can confirm the club has written to the PGMOL to raise concerns over the selection process of match officials following today’s game with Manchester United at Old Trafford.",
      "\"With such high stakes surrounding today’s fixture, the club believe a more experienced referee should have been appointed.",
      "\"Of the 10 referees to officiate across the Premier League today, Mr. Bramall was the 2nd least experienced. The decision to disallow Morgan Rogers' goal, which would have given the club a 1-0 lead with 17 minutes remaining in the match, was a major contributing factor to the club not qualifying for the Champions League.",
      "\"As per the standards that have been established over the course of the season, a decision to whistle early is clearly inconsistent with current refereeing guidelines. VAR exists to ensure that these types of situations receive the scrutiny they deserve. Unfortunately, the technology was not allowed to serve its purpose.",
      "\"Ultimately, we acknowledge that the outcome for us will not change, but we believe that it is important to address the selection methodology to ensure that high stakes matches are treated as such with regards to officiating and to ensure that the implemented VAR technology is allowed to be effective.\"",
      "The Premier League have spoken out amid the controversy to explain the decision. A statement on Sunday afternoon read: \"The referee’s call was a free kick to Manchester United with Bayindir deemed to be in control of the ball before Rogers gained possession. The whistle was blown by the referee before the ball entered the goal, therefore the incident was not reviewable by the VAR.\"",

      "Villa were left fuming at the decision, which consigned them to the Europa League, after the defeat meant they finished sixth and missed out on a Champions League spot on goal difference.

      "It marks United's worst-ever Premier League season and the 13-times champions will not be able to rely on the financial boost that comes with qualifying for Europe. Amorim's side missed out on qualification for the Champions League after losing to Tottenham in the Europa League final.",

      "It came after Amad had opened the scoring. Eriksen netted the second from the penalty spot after the Ivorian winger had been fouled by Ian Maatsen.",
      "Fernandes would usually have stepped up to take but handed the responsibility over to his colleague, who announced his Old Trafford exit just minutes after the final whistle. He said: \"It's the best way possible with the season in mind. It was good to finish off with a bit of a smile on people's face and give something back to the fans.",

The Northern Irishman only moved to Old Trafford in 2023 on a training basis after leaving Leicester. But he was eventually offered a contract by former boss Erik ten Hag and has gone on to make 43 outings across his second spell at the club.",
      "Both Evans and Eriksen could potentially be joined by a couple of first-team stars to leave the club. Alejandro Garnacho’s future remains up in the air after being axed from the squad on the final day. Bruno Fernandes also faces an uncertain few months amid interest from Saudi Arabia."

      "The Portuguese boss finished his difficult first season with a win as the Red Devils saw off Unai Emery's side. It came just days after they were beaten in the Europa League final, which curtailed their chances of qualifying for the Champions League.",
      "Amorim has continued to speak candidly throughout the season, making some bold statements, including claiming he was managing \"maybe the worst Manchester United team in history.\" United have lost shy just of half of their league games.",
      "But the ex-Sporting Lisbon boss, who has continued to shoulder responsibility for the club's struggles, got on the mic after the full-time whistle and apologised to the fans for their dire campaign, but was adamant that good times were coming.",
      "Amorim said: “I want to apologise for this season. I know you are really disappointed with me and with the team. The second thing I want to say is thank-you. We are very grateful for your support during the season, which I know was really bad.",
      "“It was really hard in many games, but now, for me, we have to make a choice – stay stuck in the past - because this season is in the past, it's over. We fight each other or we stick together and move forward. Six months ago, in my first three games in charge, with two victories and one draw, I said to you the storm is coming,",
      "“Today, after this disastrous season, I want to tell you - the good days are coming. If there is one club in the word that can overcome any situation, any disaster it is our club, Manchester United. I also want to say thank-you to my players. Sometimes I am not fair, but always I try to be honest with you. Thank-you very much, see you next season.”",
      "Amorim endured huge struggles after replacing Erik ten Hag. The 40-year-old's first defeat came at Arsenal in early December, before he went on to lose five times in a single month. In 2025 United have only beaten two teams outside the relegation zone.",
      "The Portuguese boss added: \"We are trying. We had momentum in other games like this. In the [Europa League] final, we were clearly the strong team. But sometimes we do not score. We had so many chances today. We are improving but we have a lot more to do next season.\"",

      "And just look that, it's all over. Manchester United's most horrendous of all seasons, their most dire Premier League campaign since the league's inception, is complete.",
      "My word how they'll hope there's no repeat. However, unless there's major, major change over the next three months to an unprecedented degree, next season may well be as much of a struggle as this one has been.",
      "Goals from Amad - one of their stars this season, enjoying a really smart breakthrough campaign - and a penalty from the soon-to-be departed Christian Eriksen, both late in the day, ensured the three points on a day where supporters protested outside the ground against the club's owners, the Glazer family and Sir Jim Ratcliffe, and Alejandro Garnacho was dumped from the squad, with his future now almost certainly set to be elsewhere.",
      "Amorim insists the Argentine will be part of the club's post-season tour and that he's still a Manchester United player. He may well head on the former, but whether he truly is the latter, we'll only find out when the August transfer deadline has been and gone.",
      "As usual, Bruno Fernandes played his part, his lovely chipped ball finding Amad for the opener against 10-men Villa, for whom Emi Martinez was sent off in the first half for what can only be described as a rush of blood to the head.",
      "That looked like being the day's main talking point in Manchester, the defining moment as the Villans missed out on a spot in the Champions League. But with the scores still goalless, and with less than 20 minutes remaining, it was rendered obsolete by the refereeing error that will leave Aston Villa furious.",
      "Morgan Rogers put the ball into the net but was deemed to have fouled goalkeeper Altay Bayindir in the build up. Referee Thomas Bramall blew his whistle very quickly - but it wasn't even a foul.",
      "And because Bramall blew his whistle, the decision couldn't be changed by the Video Assistant Referees.",
      "A statement from the Premier League Match Centre declared: \"The referee’s call was a free kick to Manchester United with Bayindir deemed to be in control of the ball before Rogers gained possession. The whistle was blown by the referee before the ball entered the goal, therefore the incident was not reviewable by the VAR.\"",
      "Their fury was compounded by Amad and Eriksen's goals - the penalty decision for the latter leading Unai Emery to applaud sarcastically in his technical area. Emery followed the officials down the tunnel to vent his frustrations, unsurprisingly.",
      "One touching note in the second half came as Jonny Evans was brought on for his 241st and final United appearance. He's leaving at the end of the season when his contract runs out and looks likely to retire. Still, among many United fans, there remains puzzlement that Louis van Gaal allowed him to leave - for just £6million - to West Bromwich Albion when in his prime 10 years ago.",
      "He won't be a part of what Amorim hopes will be a new-look United next season. Nor will Eriksen, who confirmed post-match: “I wish Man Utd and the fans all the best. Incredible stadium and club, they will be back at the top at some point I’m sure.”",
      "They won't be the only ones.",
      "Amorim apologised to fans with his on-field address after the final whistle and vowed “good days are coming”.",

      "A furious Unai Emery waited for referee Thomas Bramall at the Old Trafford tunnel after Aston Villa's highly controversial defeat at Manchester United. Villa went into the final day of the Premier League season needing a positive result - and others to go their way - in order to secure a return to the Champions League.",
      "But their hopes were dashed at The Theatre of Dreams as they lost 2-0 and will have to settle for the Europa League. Villa thought they had opened the scoring in the second half when Morgan Rogers nicked the ball off United goalkeeper Altay Bayindir before rolling the ball into the empty net.",
      "However, referee Bramall adjudged that Rogers had fouled the keeper, blowing the whistle before the goal was scored. That meant that VAR was unable to intervene and award the goal.",

The whistle was blown by the referee before the ball entered the goal, therefore the incident was not reviewable by the VAR.\"",
      "Villa's frustrations only heightened minutes later when Amad scored the all-important opening goal. Christian Eriksen then made it two from the spot, with the visitors left to rue the controversial call.",
      "After the final whistle, Emery waited at the mouth of the Old Trafford tunnel to talk to the officials and was seen angrily discussing the incident as they made their way off the pitch.",
      "It meant Villa's impressive season ended on somewhat of a sour note, despite securing European football for the third successive season. But after reaching the Champions League quarters and coming within a whisker of pulling off a miraculous comeback vs Paris Saint-Germain, they wanted another crack at the top table.",
      "Perhaps adding to their regret was the fact that results did go in Villa's way in the final knockings of the domestic season. Emery's men needed a favour from elsewhere and got it with Newcastle losing to Everton at home.",
      "But they were unable to capitalise with a below-par performance from the Villans. United dominated much of the early going and were then given a huge boost when Emiliano Martinez was shown a straight red for denying a goalscoring opportunity.",
      "That happened when Matty Cash's under-hit backpass was picked off by Rasmus Hojlund who attempted to round the World Cup winner. Martinez was called into action and performed a body check on the United forward. Referee Bramall immediately gave him his marching orders with the VAR in Stockley Park backing up his decision.",
      "A statement on that decision read: \"The referee’s call of red card to Martinez for denial of an obvious goal scoring opportunity (DOGSO) was checked and confirmed by VAR.\"",

      "As Gary Lineker prepares to host Match of the Day for the final time, viewers will be reminded of one of his more awkward on-air moments involving former Manchester United manager Erik ten Hag.",
      "Despite a challenging second season with the Red Devils, 55-year-old Ten Hag managed to secure a 2-1 win over Manchester City in last year's FA Cup final, adding another trophy to his English football collection. Lineker was present at Wembley and had the opportunity to interview Ten Hag after what could arguably be considered his most significant coaching success.",
      "Throughout the season, Lineker and his fellow pundits had been critical of Ten Hag and United, who ended up in a then-club-record low eighth place in the Premier League. Lineker questioned Ten Hag about whether he felt \"unfairly treated\" by the media, including \"the likes of ourselves\", gesturing towards Alan Shearer, Wayne Rooney and Micah Richards.",
      "Faced with those who had criticised him throughout the season, Ten Hag's response was brief and to the point. \"I think so,\" he said, adding: \"The team, me as well, it was not right.\"",
      "This led to a slightly uncomfortable moment as Lineker and his colleagues found themselves in a more direct confrontation than they're used to. However, Ten Hag seemed quite content to voice his complaints.",
      "Shearer tried to lighten the mood with a veiled compliment to Ten Hag, saying: \"The only thing I would say to that though... you had a team out there today who showed a great attitude, great ability, won every single tackle.",
      "\"That hasn't always been the case this season though, has it? So you can understand why we do criticise sometimes. If you played like that every single week, you wouldn't have finished in eighth. Today was unbelievable.\"",
      "Ten Hag replied by asserting that the squad that beat City at Wembley wasn't always available to him, responding: \"We didn't have the players [due to injuries]. You're right, we've seen the same things, there was not always good football.",
      "\"Definitely not. But we had to make all the time compromises. Then you can't play the football you want to play. I'm now two years here and probably three or four times we had a full squad.\"",
      "Lineker will return to his familiar surroundings for Sunday's Premier League finale as he hosts MOTD for the last time. It will signal the end of his 26-year tenure leading the flagship football programme.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more."

      "The United Review programme cover was of the Stretford End, taken from the goalframe at the opposite end. Perhaps there was a message concealed in that image: that the ball has not ended up between those posts often enough this season.",
      "This time, the ball did. For the first time in 346 minutes. Amad's cushioned header ended an eight-game winless run in the Premier League. Manchester United hit Emiliano Martinez, posts right and left, the crossbar and anything either side of the goalframe. Amorim kicked a water bottle, Casemiro kicked the post. Amad used his head.",
      "They even scored again. Soccer Aid is not until next month yet Ruben Amorim made some charitable selections and Bruno Fernandes made a charitable decision. He let Christian Eriksen take the 87th-minute penalty that confirmed Aston Villa's defeat.",
      "United's first league win in two months was procured by their two best players of the season, Fernandes crossing for Amad. The Stretford End willed Fernandes to take the penalty, perhaps anticipating a valediction from the captain. The three points took United past the 40-point mark and up to a flattering 15th.",
      "Champions League-chasing Villa were outplayed before and after they became a man light. Teams have beaten United without performing this season. Villa were beyond bad when victory would have secured a top five finish.",
      "\"Champions League, you're having a laugh,\" chuckled the United fans as Villa ended the season in sixth. \"Premier League, you're having a laugh,\" came the reply.",
      "It will have improved United fans' mood no end that Martinez's Villa career possibly ended with a first-half expulsion. Martinez saw red for cynically barging over Rasmus Hojlund after he mistimed his charge outside the area in added time of the first half.",
      "Martinez goaded the Stretford End in 2021 with a schadenfreude jig after Fernandes skied a penalty. Many in there had not forgotten that as they bid Martinez \"cheerio\" and offered some other forms of sign language.",
      "For nearly three years Martinez has dined off his World Cup final-winning save from the France forward Randal Kolo Muani. Villa fans serenaded the \"world's number one\" when Martinez has always had a clanger in him. He was culpable for Paris Saint-Germain's goals that ejected Villa from the Champions League.",
      "A burly United fan had some verbals with Villa staff who had the gall to dispute referee Thomas Bramall's decision. They did not part on an amicable note.",
      "Only three changes from the anaemic Europa League final defeat to Tottenham, with Altay Bayindir and Victor Lindelof recalled for probable farewell appearances, seemed insufficient from Amorim. Jonny Evans made a comeback appearance, his first in five months, before heading off into the sunset, bound for retirement.",
      "They are still playing 'Take Me Home' in between the teams' emergence and kick-off at Old Trafford. The first time United did that in September, Liverpool wiped the floor of them. The chorus was more funereal this time.",
      "Neither Alejandro Garnacho nor Luke Shaw were in the squad for different reasons. Neither were in the directors' box, either, as they each took a seat in their own hospitality boxes. Garnacho is unlikely to be seen at Old Trafford again after today, having been informed he was free to leave. Shaw's contract still has two years left to run.",
      "United fly to Kuala Lumpur for their post-season tour on Sunday evening. There were jokes at the convenient timing of the injuries to Noussair Mazraoui and Ayden Heaven. Diogo Dalot came on for Mazraoui and then went off at half-time.",
      "'We'll never die', a chant usually reserved for the dying embers of matches, reverberated around the ground in the 11th minute to try and banish the memory of Bilbao. Amorim's chant was aired soon after, albeit not heartily and a Villa attack quickly ended its rendition. The Stretford End sang it loudly in the second half.",
      "United were uncharacteristically enterprising in the opening minutes and Villa played as though daunted by the fact they had only won three times at Old Trafford in 42 years. That stat still stands.",
      "Villa were afflicted with stage fright all afternoon. Unai Emery was nearer the corner flag than the dugout during a stoppage as he attempted to alert Ian Maatsen to the danger. The message did not get through, as Dalot ran off Maatsen soon after yet attempted to cushion the ball into Hojlund's path when he was one-on-one. Maatsen clumsily conceded the late penalty by treading on Amad.",
      "The away section was one of the quietest all season until word reached Villa's followers that Newcastle United had gone behind, briefly elevating them to fifth again. Villa fans could not even summon the energy to renew their enmity with Fernandes, an antagonist on the basis of a penalty he was awarded at Villa Park during the Covid-19 pandemic.",
      "Martinez's red card only fuelled the dread among the Brummies. Villa were so harmless that Bayindir had to run around to stay warm in blustery conditions. Bayindir will have been hot under the collar after he fumbled the ball under the advances of Morgan Rogers, who scooped the ball in.",
      "The referee blew for a foul. The replays suggested Bayindir did not have the ball. Minutes later, the ball was in the back of the Stretford End net through Amad."

      "\"I believe in VAR and I think we have very good referees in the Premier League, but sometimes make a mistake. With this goal, maybe we could get a better result and a Champions League position, but we didn’t deserve more than the result we have.\"",
      "When asked if the referee had apologised, Emery said: \"It is not necessary. He knows. He makes a mistake.\"",
      "Villa's director of football, Damian Vidagany, then confirmed an official complaint would be made. “The complaint is not about the decision. The complaint is about the selection of the referees,\" he said.",
      "\"One of the most inexperienced referees for one of the most difficult matches of the season involving another four or five teams. It's not about the decision. The decision is clear. It's a mistake.",
      "\"The referee apologised for the mistake. We can do nothing. The problem is why the experienced international referees were not here today.”",
      "The Premier League's match centre released a statement and said: \"The referee’s call was a free kick to Manchester United with Bayindir deemed to be in control of the ball before Rogers gained possession.",
      "\"The whistle was blown by the referee before the ball entered the goal, therefore the incident was not reviewable by the VAR.\""

      "With the scores tied at 0-0 in the second half, Villa felt they had taken the lead when Rogers pipped Altay Bayindir to the ball and tapped home into an empty net. However, before the winger could score, Bramall had already blown his whistle to stop play.",
      "His belief was that Bayindir had two hands on the ball when Rogers nipped in. However, replays showed that this was not the case and VAR would have overruled the decision.",
      "The issue is that, under Premier League rules, the VAR cannot check the decision because Bramall had already halted proceedings. Therefore, the fould stood.",
      "Moments later, Amad gave United the lead against Villa with Christian Eriksen wrapping up the points from the penalty spot in his final appearance for the club. The tough pill for Villa to swallow was that a draw would have been enough to gain Champions League football as Newcastle lost at home to Everton.",

      "There will be some changes from the Europa League final here but given the squad are going to the Far East staight after the game, there is little point in making too many wholesale changes. I'm not starting them but Eriksen and Evans deserve a final farewell appearance off the bench.",
      "Maguire can start again from the Europa League final but Shaw needs to come out. Lindelof can start on what is also his farewell appearance and Tyler Fredricson can get another opportunity. I would start Amad as a wing-back, with Amass on the other side.",
      "Mainoo has to start. Garnacho's petulance has dominated headlines by the midfielder has just as much reason to be angry with his role in Bilbao. Ugarte can also return.",

      "With nothing but trying to avoid finishing one place above the relegation zone on the line for United this afternoon, changes are increasingly likely from Amorim. Evans will be leaving at the end of his contract and it would be fitting for him to make his final appearance for United at Old Trafford.",
      "Ugarte, after not starting in the Europa League final, should return in midfield, likewise Mainoo. Dalot, if he is fit enough to start, deserves a recall at right wing-back and Amass deserves the nod on the opposite flank.",

      "Then Amorim was asked about Garnacho again in the embargoed section, and he reiterated: \"Guys, everything I have to say, I say it to the players, I did that in the past and you know.",
      "\"I’ve been here for six months and continue to do that, so let’s focus on the next game.\"",

      "The likes of Scott McTominay, Dean Henderson and Anthony Elanga have enjoyed tremendous seasons, and Amorim admitted their performances serve as a 'warning' about selling academy graduates.",
      "\"It's always a warning because we need to get the recruitment right, that is clear,\" Amorim said. \"And again, some players played here and they had opportunities and then they go away and they flourish.",
      "\"That can happen. We need to look at our team, imagine a way of playing, put the right players in position to improve as a team because if one team is playing well, all the players are going to play well.",
      "\"So we need to build a strong core to have to support all the kids that come from the academy, and we have a lot to do, but that is normal because they are quality players. They go to some places and they flourish. That can happen.\"",
      "Amorim discussed the pitfalls of selling graduates on the same day he informed Garnacho, one of the biggest recent success stories from the academy, that he should find a new club.",
      "That suggests Amorim is comfortable and at ease with his decision to move him on this summer.",
      "United will have to reinvest the money they receive for Garnacho, but there has been little evidence that the club can recruit well. \"Of course, I believe and we are improving,\" said Amorim about signing players.",
      "\"We are improving in the data that we want. We have a rule that is not just a manager that chooses, there has to be connection. There is no player that comes here without my approval, but the opposite is the same. That is important for not just one manager to control everything.",
      "\"We are putting all these things to improve the recruitment. For me, the important thing in the recruitment is to know how we are going to play, and that is really clear, and you can see we have a new point every time the way we play, but we have a clear idea how to play.",
      "\"If you have a clear idea how to play, you can point the specific players that you want for that position, and that is clear, and we are doing that together with all the data, the physical data to cope with the demands of the Premier League.",

      "Amorim has taken on a huge challenge in Manchester, the extent of which he wasn't aware of until he actually walked through the door. \"I already talked about that. I didn’t regret,\" Amorim said.",
      "\"I suffer like any Mancunian suffers to see all the things. Yes, the problems for me was deeper than I was thinking because I can watch, I can feel it during trainings at Carrington, all our organisation, then it’s not the problems, but the stability in our club. Everybody is changing.",
      "\"All the departments are changing, so we did that in one year. In six months, we are doing everything, so everything is more difficult, but I think we are getting some steps to improve things. You cannot see that because results are so poor, but we are in a better place, that I can guarantee you.\"",
      "When asked if United are now in a better position, Amorim said: \"I think it’s healthier, it’s a way to put it. You cannot see it with the results, we have worse results, but I think we are in a better place as a club with the small things that will be big things in the future.",
      "\"So it’s hard to explain everything. I don’t want to touch on every point, but yes, we are in a better place. I am not happier because it’s impossible to be happier, especially after Wednesday and with our results and form in the league.",
      "\"So I’m not happier, I am suffering like everybody, but I know what we are doing and that gives me positivity and confidence for the future. It’s hard to explain [having confidence].",
      "\"I know you guys are talking all the time and people don’t just want to hear the same things. I think I have the same principles, I have the same rules. With winning, that I knew because winning in Portugal is a different world to winning in England.",
      "\"But even losing, I have the same idea, the same rules and I know what way we want to do it, what kind of players we want, so that gives me confidence because I don’t lose myself. I know what to do, and then time will tell with results because that will need to change.\"",
      "Amorim's press conference will be worth listening to again after Aston Villa on Sunday evening."

      "Manchester United legend Gary Neville has made a playful reference to his ban from attending Nottingham Forest's City Ground this afternoon for their crucial clash against Chelsea.",
      "Both Forest and Chelsea are battling for a place in next season's Champions League this afternoon. If the East Midlands club win, they only need a club above them to drop points to seal a spot at European football's top table.",
      "Should Chelsea be victorious, they would secure Champions League football. Anything less and they will be watching what happens at Old Trafford with Aston Villa pushing for a spot in the top five.",
      "With so many eyeballs expected to be on Forest, Sky had planned for the match to take precedence and had therefore looked to gain accreditation for Neville to join Peter Drury in the gantry. But taking to social media this weekend, the former United captain confirmed he had been banned.",
      "\"Personally, I think it’s disappointing that a great club like Nottingham Forest have been reduced to making such a decision. Whilst they have every right to choose who they let into their own stadium, it’s symptomatic of things that have happened over the last 12 months with the club.",
      "\"I wish the coaching staff, players and fans of the club all the best in their quest to achieve Champions League football.\" Neville has been critical of Forest recently having blasted them for threatening legal action against the Premier League for a referee error last season.",
      "He was also critical of Forest owner Evangelos Marinakis for confronting Nuno Espirito Santo after the draw with Leicester City. However, it appears that Neville is not taking the decision too seriously after he joked about it on his social channels.",
      "After United shared a video of Neville making his debut against Coventry City, the 50-year-old shared it to his Instagram story, accompanied with the caption: \"From my debut on the final day back in 1994 to being banned on the final day in 2025!",
      "It is unclear whether Neville will feature at all on Sky's coverage this afternoon but it is claimed the production of the match is being moved to Sky's studios in London."

      "Garnacho replaced Mason Mount in the 71st minute of the Europa League final against Tottenham, and he expressed his frustration when he spoke after the 1-0 defeat.",
      "\"Up until the final I played every round helping the team, and today I play 20 minutes, I don't know,\" said Garnacho. \"The final will influence [my decision] but the whole season, the situation of the club. I'm going to try to enjoy the summer and see what happens afterwards.\"",
      "Earlier in the day, Garnacho uploaded a photo of himself scoring in last season's FA Cup final on Instagram. It appeared to suggest he'd been omitted from the starting XI, and Garnacho was confirmed to be on the bench at the Estadio de San Mames when the team news was revealed.",
      "Fernandes has been linked with a move to Saudi Arabia in the summer. United sources recently insisted they had no plans to sell Fernandes, but a huge offer from Al-Hilal might be difficult to turn down.",
      "The 30-year-old looked crestfallen as he collected his runners-up medal after defeat to Tottenham, and he also spoke honestly about his future to journalists in the mixed zone after the game.",
      "Speaking at his pre-Aston Villa press conference, Amorim was asked about the futures of Garnacho and Fernandes and said: \"I always speak to my players, but the focus now is on the last game.",
      "\"I don't know what is going to happen. We have a plan and we prepared for both situations, with Champions League and without. We have an idea what type of squad we want, but now we have to focus on the last game and we will have time address all of those situations.\"",
      "When asked whether the Europa League final had changed his opinion on some players, Amorim responded: \"No, what changes is one less competition, that game in the middle of the week.",
      "\"You can manage the squad in a different way, so that rotation of the players, the depth of the squad, that changes completely if you have three or four competitions.",
      "\"That changes a little bit the plan, but not the way I look at my players just by looking at the final.\"",
      "Chelsea and Napoli were both interested in signing Garnacho in the January transfer window.",
      "Sales of academy graduates are classified as 'total profit' within Profit and Sustainability Rules (PSR).",
      "Concerns have been raised about Garnacho's attitude. In February, he apologised to his United teammates after storming off down the tunnel at Old Trafford when he was substituted against Ipswich Town.",
      "Fernandes will turn 31 in September and Al-Hilal might test United's stance on their captain after missing out on the signing of Mohamed Salah, who extended his Liverpool contract."

      "\"We suffer a goal near the half-time and try everything in the second half, but it was really hard because like I said before the match, if you don’t win the final, it’s really harder to deal with that.\"",
      "Amorim continued: \"I will not try to convince you otherwise, it’s been a tough season, but we had that hope we could win something and that could help us to finish the season in a different way.",
      "\"The way we can get up is to focus on the next game, to finish in a good way. When you start thinking about the future and the squad, a new season is going to start, and we will start with new ambitions and try to do better.",
      "\"I think these six months were really hard, a lot of changes, not just for me, but for all of the club. We did so many changes inside the club, sometimes it takes like five years or three years to change all the personnel and a lot of things. We changed coach in the middle of the season and we changed the way we play.",
      "\"It was a really tough season. Now it's the part we need to enjoy, to focus on the future and be positive. We know what to do, I know how I want to play, that is clear. With all the mistakes you guys point to me, I know how I want to play and that is the exciting moment we can change something.\"",
      "Aston Villa make the trip to Old Trafford this weekend and have a settled hierarchy at Villa Park, which has seen them establish themselves as consistent European challengers.",
      "\"They have stability, they are used to fighting for the first places, so we want to do that also, but there are a lot of things that are really good with this kind of club,\" said Amorim",
      "\"But when you are in this situation, you feel it will take time, but we will improve. It’s not [how many] windows and sometimes we don’t know. Things can change fast. I cannot say how many windows or how many years to reach that point, but we can improve, that is clear.\"",
      "Amorim confirmed his squad would be assessed after the final game of the season. \"We have the next game against Aston Villa, we need to focus on that. This is not over,\" he said.",

      "\"In this moment, I’m really glad that I arrived six months before we start a new season. I think we are going to avoid a lot of mistakes that would be in the next season,\" said Amorim.",
      "\"Now is the time that we can use all that suffering to change things in the summer. And when I say in the summer it’s not just the players. There are a lot of things that we need to change in our club.",

      "Luke Chadwick can still remember the first time. He was a Manchester United youngster on loan at Antwerp in Belgium and finally starting to feel like a professional footballer. He was playing regularly, playing well, and loving his time there.",
      "He was such a part of the club that he was asked to do an interview with a national newspaper. Then just 19, he hadn't done any media training at United and hated speaking to the press, but he did it and stumbled his way through it. He went out and bought a copy of the newspaper to see what kind of rave review he was going to get.",
      "\"I don’t even know why I bought it because I can’t speak Flemish, I can’t read it, but there was a couple of words in there I could get,\" said Chadwick.",
      "In fairness, it didn't take a lot of translating. 'Dentures a la Bugs Bunny,' was one. There were several references to 'acne'. Chadwick's heart sank.",
      "\"I wanted to go and get all the copies so no one else could read it. It was just a really unpleasant, uncomfortable feeling. It was like I was embarrassed for myself, I'm embarrassed that loads of people are going to see what this person has wrote about me and I just felt, I don't know, I struggled to let it go out of my mind, it was always just there, it was something I just kept thinking about.\"",
      "Chadwick first touched on the issues he had felt when his looks became such a part of the public consciousness in a social media post during lockdown in 2020. He talks about it candidly again in his new book, Not Just A Pretty Face, and more than two decades on from when he became an unwitting celebrity for something other than his football, he is unflinchingly honest about how it made him feel.",
      "After his post five years ago, he received apologies from Nick Hancock and Gary Lineker for their part in the mickey-taking on the TV game show 'They Think It’s All Over', but he said it was unnecessary then and is still unnecessary now. He holds no bitterness towards the people involved, and if anything seems more self-critical, that he was unable to understand why it was making him feel the way he did.",
      "\"I felt quite helpless about it because I'd never open up, I'd never talk about it because I didn't have the self-awareness to do it, I didn't have the emotional intelligence to say 'this is bothering me',\" said Chadwick, who never had an issue with how he looked.",
      "“When you don't do that, it just gets worse and worse and it's just a vicious circle. When I got back to England and it got worse, I just thought that that's all I am, I'm just a picture of fun, someone that looks funny to people, that doesn't look how a footballer or anyone should look.",
      "\"The biggest challenge was how I was with myself because I treated myself so unkindly about it, I wouldn't give myself a break, it was like ‘Why are you letting this affect you?\"",
      "Chadwick refused to speak to friends and family about the issue and insisted all was fine, but inside things got so bad that as his career as a United player came to an end in 2004, he could see an upside in disappearing out of the public eye a little.",
      "\"I'd just try and sweep it to the back of my mind, I wouldn't speak to my family about it, I wouldn't speak to my girlfriend about it, I wouldn't speak to my friends if anyone said anything about it,\" he said.",
      "\"I'd just sort of say, 'don't bother me, it's funny', laugh along with it and that sort of thing, where inside it was eating away at me and I think it got to a point when I did leave that it was quite a relief to be out and where not many people are as bothered about you when you're playing in the Championship.\"",
      "Chadwick reflects on that time in the early 2000s as a big part of his journey and something that has helped him understand his own mental health and how important it is to open up.",
      "\"It's a massive part of my life and my self-development, in terms of going through that has allowed me to understand my thoughts and feelings, my mental health a lot better, and to be able to deal with that,\" he said.",
      "\"I just thought I was weak, stop being weak, which was the completely wrong way to think about it, but unfortunately, that's how I was at the time, and I thought I can't be vulnerable, the only people that are are weak people, which is completely wrong.",
      "\"It's still going on that journey of learning about yourself that being vulnerable is the only way we can deal with challenging situations and to talk out and to speak about them.\"",
      "Chadwick met with the MEN at Hotel Football. He was recognised by one young fan who asked for a selfie, but the 44-year-old revealed that when he returns to Manchester and the stadium he graced for a few years, he struggles to piece together that young footballer and the man he is now.",
      "\"When I look back now and walk past Old Trafford, I cannot believe that I used to play in that stadium and the enormity of it now is much bigger than when you're actually in it,\" he said.",
      "\"I definitely didn't appreciate it. I think it's hard as a 19 or 20-year-old kid to really appreciate what you're doing and know that you're in a very privileged situation.",
      "\"I recognise that you've got to be very special to stay at Man United for a long period of time, but it's more football in general, you're doing something you love doing, but it's something where you're never satisfied, you're never really happy.",
      "\"There's always something good that happens, but then it's on to the next one and you never really get that satisfaction. I've done something that I've loved doing. I've played at Old Trafford a few times. It's crazy.\"",
      "Chadwick's book is searingly honest and full of humour and the title reveals he is not afraid of poking a little fun at himself as well. It also reveals a footballer who never lost his love of the game.",
      "He was with Arsenal when United approached him about a trial at the age of 14. Although a Cambridge United fan, he followed Manchester United thanks to the emergence of young players like Ryan Giggs, and when offered the chance of a week-long trial, he jumped at it.",
      "He met Alex Ferguson on the final day and scored in front of the Scot. He felt he had done well and chewed over the week on the train back to his Cambridgeshire village where he was picked up by his mum.",
      "\"When she picked me up, I got in the car and she said that Alex Ferguson had phoned her up and asked if I would sign,\" remembers Chadwick.",
      "\"I thought she was mucking about to start with, but to get that there was only one club I was going to. I was so scared though because I had to tell Arsenal.\"",
      "They didn't want to take no for an answer, so youth team boss Terry Murphy told manager Bruce Rioch, and they turned up at the Chadwick residence to make their case.",
      "\"We sat with Bruce and Terry knowing that I was going to sign for United,\" said Chadwick. \"As soon as United offered me something, I was never going to go [back to Arsenal]. I didn't tell Bruce that, I just said I needed a bit of time to think about it. I think I got my mum to phone up Terry in the end.",
      "\"Arsenal was obviously a brilliant football club, but I didn't really enjoy it that much, going there training on a Wednesday night, going into London, going to Highbury. Some brilliant players, the coaches were great, but I was so shy and introverted back then, I was really uncomfortable, I really disliked playing with people that I wasn’t comfortable with.",
      "\"At United it was just the way that you were made to feel, you just immediately felt even as a 14 year old kid part of something really special and I absolutely loved it and felt so different, I didn't feel as shy or as introverted, I felt really comfortable because of the way that the coaches were and they were so enthusiastic, they were so happy to see us kids that were there as well and I just fell in love with it straight away.\"",
      "Chadwick was scouted and signed as a striker, but he lacked the physical strength to play up front and was turned into a hard-working winger by Eric Harrison.",
      "As he progressed through the ranks, there was a little excitement and expectation in the air around Chadwick, and he admits he got \"big-headed\" at one point. He was then dropped for an FA Youth Cup tie against Blackburn and brought back down to earth.",
      "He did crack the first team. He made 39 appearances and scored two goals, both in the Premier League, one of which was the clear highlight of his time at the club.",
      "\"I think the one that I still dine out on today was scoring at Elland Road. I think that goal was the best three-yard tap-in of all time,\" he said. \"I came on at half-time because I think Nicky Butt got injured in a re-jig in midfield, and Nigel Martyn was one of the best goalies in the Premier League at the time but he had an absolute stinker that day.",
      "\"I remember just tapping it in and running off like a lunatic. I was just euphoric. I remember warming up in the first half constantly, because I think Butty had a problem early on and the dogs abuse I was getting when I was running up and down that touch line.",
      "“It just felt like when I scored, I was just absolutely buzzing that I'd scored at their end as well.\"",
      "Chadwick can also remember the game when he realised he was done at Old Trafford.",
      "\"I think when I realised that my time was coming to an end, I came on off the bench. It was against Olympiakos [in October 2002] and we were winning 2-0. I came on as a double sub with Quinton Fortune with about 20 minutes to go.",
      "\"I'd just come back from being off for a couple of months with problems with my groin and pelvis and I felt like I just couldn't get out of third gear.",
      "\"They came back, made it 2-2, and I was thinking 'that's because I've come on, we were winning 2-0'. I remember Scholesy scored a worldie to make it 3-2 at the end so we ended up winning but I just sort of sat in the dressing room after that game thinking, ‘I'm just not at the level here, I need to get my injury sorted’ and I think I just need to start a different challenge, something where I can feel like I'm offering a lot more than I was at the time.\"",
      "While Chadwick contributed to the United cause on the pitch, in a way, it's the daily training sessions he remembers and the standards set then that made the days in between games even more challenging.",
      "\"Every day was so intense,\" he said. \"I remember the season when I was in and around it and sort of played a few games, didn't start many, which meant if you weren't playing you'd train more or less every day for the Champions League and everything, and at the end of the season I was just absolutely exhausted, like physically and mentally, because it was just so, so intense every day.",
      "\"You've got 25 of the best players in the country, and they're all desperate to win the training games and everything. The amount that helps you as a young player, and the lessons I learned from the club are what allowed me to go and have a career in professional football.",
      "\"It was such a steep learning curve, it's given everything every day, and that's what created the success of the club.\"",
      "Chadwick's career eventually ended at his boyhood club, and he admits he struggled with the end of his playing career.",
      "\"I didn't really know what I was going to do, and mentally I just lost all of my identity,\" he said. \"I'd always been a footballer and I thought ‘that’s the best part of life over now’. It's all going to be rubbish now. I'm just going to get old. What do old footballers do? Become coaches.\"",
      "But he didn't enjoy it. The kid who loved football and maintained that passion throughout his career now found himself moaning at referees and the children he coached. He admits he \"hated the person\" he had become at football.",
      "A business opportunity with former colleagues attracted him to the Football Fun Factory, a project offering fun football to children that he is now passionate about.",
      "\"I was seven or eight and I signed for my first grassroots club called Melbourn Tigers. I remember the coaches were called Colin and Martin and I still remember them to this day, they made it so much fun and they were probably the most important coaches, because if I didn't get them positive early experiences I probably wouldn't have become a professional footballer. I wouldn't still love football.",
      "\"It's so important so the opportunity to do that on a mass scale, so tens and thousands of children are joining the Football Fun Factory programs and falling in love with football really captured my imagination.\"",
      "It is back where the journey began for Chadwick."

He posted pictures of what looks like an individual training session at Villa’s Bodymoor Heath training ground with the caption reading: “Outside running again! 79% of my maximum speed. The comeback is always better than the setback.”",
      "United have made him available for a fee of £40 million, and Villa do not have first refusal on the player. Sources close to Rashford also say that he is not prepared to take a wage cut on his £325,000-a-week salary.",

      "Arsenal account for more than half of the seven worst Premier League runners-up ever based on points total, with Manchester United making an appearance.",
      "",
      "Arsenal, 2024/25 – 72 points\nMikel Arteta knows better than anyone that “winning trophies is about being in the right moment in the right place,” and the points tally delivered in his fifth full campaign would not have been enough to secure the title in any Premier League season, moment or place.",
      "Arsenal fell only three short of matching the record for most draws in a Premier League campaign and converting less than half of those into wins would have been enough to pip Liverpool. It is weird that they didn’t simply do that.",
      "It is the next step and the hope is Viktor Gyokeres can help them take it, but Arsenal will need better luck with injuries and significant improvement away at sides in the top half to cross that championship threshold.",
      "",
      "Manchester United, 2020/21 – 74 points\nThe previous time Manchester United lost a Europa League final they could at least console themselves with a second runners-up medal in the Premier League. There was also an overwhelming sense that a change of manager was needed at Old Trafford then because some things never change.",
      "“No-one will remember how the league table looked like on the 12th of January in 2021,” was how Ole Gunnar Solskjaer grossly underestimated the recollective powers of a formerly good website. Manchester United were top, three points clear of Liverpool and a further four ahead of eventual champions Manchester City.",
      "Leicester, Everton, Spurs and Southampton were in the top seven; it was a wild time.",
      "But that was forever destined to be consigned to the realm of forgotten title challenges, an average second half of the season confirming the suspicion that this was not a team ready to break into the elite.",
      "Cristiano Ronaldo was added to the ranks in a Manchester City-induced panic that summer and Solskjaer was sacked by November after they slipped to what do in 2025 seem the particularly heady heights of 7th.",
      "",
      "Arsenal, 1999/2000 – 73 points\nUntil Pep Guardiola and Jurgen Klopp ruined everything by setting absurd bars for final totals, the distant record for biggest title-winning points margin stood at 18 for almost two decades.",
      "When Manchester United were crowned as the first champions of the millennium in late April, their eventual bridesmaids were not even in place yet. Liverpool were their closest contenders, with Arsenal six points behind and armed with two games in hand.",
      "The outlook was far bleaker for Arsene Wenger’s side at one stage. A 2-1 defeat to Middlesbrough in March left them fifth behind Leeds, Liverpool and Chelsea, nine points off second and what was the only other Champions League group stage qualification place, which was the style at the time.",
      "A run of eight straight wins thereafter bumped them into second, but still laughably far off that Manchester United pace.",
      "",
      "Arsenal, 2015/16 – 71 points\nThe miracle would not have been possible if just one of the traditional challengers had shown a modicum of competence. That is not to denigrate the ludicrous achievement of Leicester, but the inherent advantages boasted by the Big Six ordinarily prevent that glass ceiling from being broken.",
      "It required The Mourinho Year, transitional periods for both Liverpool and Manchester City, and Louis van Gaal to be stumbling through his second and final Manchester United season.",
      "That might have planted seeds and opened doors in north London but Arsenal remained painfully fragile and the opportunity came probably a year too soon for Spurs, who nevertheless put up the strongest resistance to Jamie Vardy and friends.",
      "It was Mauricio Pochettino’s side who pushed them the furthest, yet St Totteringham had his say on the final day to relegate Spurs to third place in a two-horse race, their greatest Premier League season to that point still behind one of Arsenal’s worst in years.",
      "",
      "Chelsea, 2010/11 – 71 points\n‘This season’s performances have fallen short of expectations and the club feels the time is right to make this change ahead of next season’s preparations,’ read a line in the Chelsea statement which confirmed what Carlo Ancelotti had been informed in a corridor at Goodison Park within an hour of the campaign’s climax: the Italian had been sacked.",
      "It was long held as proof of Roman Abramovich’s ruthlessness but it had been the worst season of his ownership by some distance. Chelsea had not dipped below 83 points since they had access to the Russian’s chequebook, and their only entirely trophyless campaign was the Avram Grant near-Treble in 2007/08.",
      "Ancelotti followed up a Double in his debut year with early exits in each competition, while a miserable winter cost the Blues in the Premier League. Chelsea only pipped Manchester City on goal difference after two defeats and a draw in their final three games.",
      "",
      "Arsenal, 2000/01 – 70 points\nOnly one team in Premier League history has finished runners-up in three consecutive seasons – and Arsenal have contrived to do it twice. Arteta truly is Wenger’s finest pupil.",
      "As risible as their aforementioned chase the prior season was, Arsenal were humiliated in surrendering the title to Manchester United yet again in 2000/01. Sir Alex Ferguson’s side had already occupied the summit for months with a commanding lead when they hosted their closest rivals that February, but a farcically one-sided win basically wrapped things up.",
      "“The only time Arsene lost it was when we got beaten 6-1 by Man United,” David Seaman later recalled. Having named a defence of Oleg Luzhny, Gilles Grimandi, Igors Stepanovs and Ashley Cole, it is unknown quite what else the manager expected. But it was at that point Manchester United started to phone it in, recording four of their six defeats that season in the final eight matches.",
      "The belated Arsenal response was resounding as the Gunners won the title in one of the most satisfying ways imaginable the following season.",
      "",
      "Newcastle, 1996/97 – 68 points\nThe lowest points total for a Premier League champion naturally facilitated the lowest points total for a Premier League runner-up. And Newcastle accrued almost a third of them during a winning run stretching across September and most of October.",
      "They were, for a while, the runaway Premier League leaders again. But their inevitable collapse was far quicker and more anti-climactic than in the prior season, with champions Manchester United top from late January onwards.",
      "Kevin Keegan resigned from his post at St James’ Park earlier that month but Kenny Dalglish held onto second place for dear life, pipping both Arsenal and Liverpool on goal difference courtesy of a final day 5-0 thrashing of Nottingham Forest – only their fifth win in their final dozen games.",

      "I am no financial mastermind but, after about an hour or so of fact finding, I can’t help reach the conclusion that Manchester United are in absolutely really big trouble.",
      "Over the past five seasons, United have sold at a rate of 25% of the full market value. From what I can see, they have sold £708.3M worth of talent for only £172.5M. This is astonishingly bad when compared to the likes of City, Real Madrid, and Benfica and even clubs like Brighton, Bournemouth, and Leverkusen.",
      "Over the past five seasons, United have bought at a rate of 65% of the full market value. From what I can see, they have bought £681.3M worth of talent against their value of £1,024.6B. However, their current squad is valued at £516.3M, so somehow the value of their current players has decreased by nearly exactly 50%. My goodness, that’s shocking.",
      "If they were to sell their whole entire squad at a rate that they’ve been going (25% of full value), they will only be able to generate £129.1M which is based on the above patterns over the past five seasons. The BBC have also recently reported that United owe £272M in outstanding transfer payments to other clubs, £156M of which is due this summer. It’s not a stretch of a conclusion to say that selling their whole entire squad would not see off this summer’s bill alone.",
      "(Source: transfermarkt)",
      "Changing tack, over the past five seasons, United have paid their players, and wait for this, a staggering £1,040.3B. This season, United’s annual wage bill is £173.8M, but their commitment to the current players full contract lengths is a colossal £567.7M in future salary spend.",
      "(Source: capology)",
      "At the start of the year, the BBC reported £370M losses for United (including £113M in 2024) over the last five years.",
      "To indicate the scale of the problem, this guy thinks that even selling a whole squad at a rate they’ve been going coupled with total TV/prize money for finishing 17th (£253.1M) is absolutely dwarfed by their reported losses in recent years and by already committed salary spend (£937.7M)",

      "It’s one hell of a huge summer at Manchester United. If the future is bleak right now after the EUROPA League final defeat and sticking with a manager whose 3-4-3 formation is ill-suited to the Premier League and the players at his disposal, I think this could be just the start. The above indicates that United not only have to sell, but they have to sell at a 75% loss from transfer fees as well as hoping that buying clubs do not insist on United paying most of the outgoing player’s wages. And that’s just to avoid FPP sanctions if that is now even possible. Do not expect the ownership to gamble money they just don’t have on signings to keep them in the Premier League. Do not expect clubs to sell to United as they still owe transfer costs. Do not expect players to agree to move on without compensating the rest of their contracts. Expect to lose players for peanuts to offset this. Expect the club to make no new signings. Expect the club to rely on youth. Expect FFP points deductions. Expect relegation next season followed by the Championship.\nRich (let’s hope for a better season next season at The Hawthorns), WBA.",

At first, the “tartan” pattern (traditional to the region, per the Adidas marketing fluff) that makes the stripes’ edges look fuzzy from a distance looked wrong to me, but having checked out the closeup photos in the club’s webshop, it’s grown on me a good deal. The stripe treatment is really an elaboration of the 1995-96 grandad-collar kit, which featured a similar stitched-look border, and the subtle patterning of perforations (or black flecks) evident in the white stripes with the close-up shot on the club shop is rather cool. The collar is okay, and I dig the integration of den drei streifen in white into a black shoulder. It’s really well integrated.",

I’ve seen a “deconstructed” monotone version of the current badge that would look very nice indeed. We may see two versions of this shirt if they make a decision soon. For this current shirt, I suspect they’ve lightened the blue of the badge banner a bit to match the blue highlights, but maybe it’s just a lighting thing.

Nike’s 2010-11 effort disagrees violently. The JVC and Dreamcast kits are classic, but largely for the sponsors; most of them were a little pants, with too much fussiness and elaboration with the red. I think Adidas should be looking back at the late 70s kits. Those are classics.",

      "9) 1999/2000\nThe comprehensive story threads were once again absent as this final day essentially hinged on one fixture with two direct consequences. Liverpool had a first Champions League campaign within reach, occupying fourth place but sitting behind Leeds and what was then the third and last European Cup spot that could be secured through league position. The Whites traipsed up to face an exciting West Ham side of Ferdinand, Lampard, Di Canio, Wanchope and Lomas, returning only with a goalless draw which offered Gerard Houllier and his Reds an unexpected opportunity.",
      "All they had to do was beat Bradford, who had spent all but a single gameweek since the start of January in the bottom three. That mattered nought when David Wetherall thundered a Gunnar Halle cross past Sander Westerveld in the first half, nor when the Bantams defended manfully to keep Michael Owen and Emile Heskey out, with Robbie Fowler omitted from the squad.",
      "Liverpool made the best of an inexplicably bad situation, embracing their UEFA Cup consolation so much it comprised one third of the subsequent season’s technical Treble. Bradford went down with a whimper in 2000/01 by comparison.",
      "",
      "8) 2006/07\nThe agenda was again dominated by events at the lower end. Sheffield United started in 16th, ahead of West Ham, Wigan and the pair of Charlton and Watford, whose relegations had already been confirmed. Three points separated as many teams when it came to taking up the last place on the second-tier scrapheap – and two of them were playing each other.",
      "Sheffield United could have avoided defeat at home to Wigan to render moot whatever result West Ham achieved at Old Trafford. But Paul Scharner scored after 14 minutes at the DW Stadium to make matters that little more agitated. Wigan and West Ham were staying up. Then uncle Jon Stead’s brave header swapped the Latics with the Blades.",
      "As half-time beckoned across the country, Carlos Tevez soaked himself in narrative to the delight of Neil Warnock, sending the Hammers clear. It became a straight shootout between Sheffield United and Wigan, who regained the lead at Bramall Lane when Phil Jagielka handled the ball; David Unsworth, a Blade until leaving that January on a free, and who had missed a penalty in a 0-0 draw against Blackburn the prior September, beat Paddy Kenny from 12 yards in first-half stoppage time. Danny Webber hit the post when through on goal. Lee McCulloch was sent off with 16 minutes remaining. But Wigan endured to send an embittered Warnock down.",
      "",
      "7) 1996/97\nAnother Champions League implosion from Liverpool proved to be a satisfactory entrée to a relegation-centred main course. The Reds had been a point behind Manchester United with a four-point and one-game buffer to Arsenal by late February, but dreadful form down the final straight – P10 W4 D3 L3 F14 A14 – obliterated that advantage. Defeat at Wimbledon in their penultimate match meant both Arsenal and Newcastle had closed to within two points of second place and the only other European Cup qualification spot alongside champions Manchester United.",
      "Arsenal beat Derby; Newcastle pummelled Nottingham Forest and increased their superior goal difference. Liverpool needed to win at Sheffield Wednesday but went behind to O’Neill Donaldson in the 75th minute and could only pull one back through Jamie Redknapp. All three sides finished on 68 points but Newcastle ventured to the Champions League while Arsenal and Liverpool were headed to the UEFA Cup.",
      "Middlesbrough, Coventry and Nottingham Forest occupied the bottom three places, with Forest already gone. Only Southampton and Sunderland were in reach and the door was opened when they lost at Aston Villa and Wimbledon respectively. Boro could only draw against Leeds and were made to rue their January points deduction, but Coventry took full advantage of the circumstances by beating Tottenham at White Hart Lane. Traffic problems meant that game had to be kicked off 15 minutes later than the rest – Jimmy Hill must have been proud – and player-manager Gordon Strachan later claimed to be “too nervous” to play as he remained an unused substitute. It kept him fit enough to leap into the welcoming arms of Dion Dublin at full-time.",
      "",
      "6) 1993/94\nManchester City were 16th on 44 points. Southampton were 17th on 42. Sheffield United were 18th on goals scored. Ipswich were 19th on goal difference. Everton were 20th on 41 points. Oldham were 21st on 39. Swindon Town were gone.",
      "Everton were 2-0 down at home to Wimbledon after 20 minutes, their predicament seemingly unsalvageable. Oldham led Norwich after 14 minutes but their inferior goal difference required Southampton, Sheffield United and Ipswich all to lose heavily. Manchester City were dragged in that little bit closer when Sheffield Wednesday went 1-0 up. Southampton fell behind to West Ham. By half-time, Sheffield United were beating Chelsea at Stamford Bridge and had four points and three teams between themselves and Everton. Manchester City equalised for the point they needed at Sheffield Wednesday. Southampton would concede a late Lee Chapman equaliser at West Ham but were clear.",
      "But Everton staged an improbable comeback to lead Wimbledon, thus taking Ipswich – drawing at Blackburn – down with Oldham. The Tractor Boys could do nothing to affect their own fate as they laboured to a stalemate, yet two late goals from Mark Stein at Chelsea, the last in stoppage time, spared them and put Sheffield United into the relegation zone for the first and most crucial time on the final day.",
      "",
      "No team had been relegated going into the final day and two points separated Norwich, Southampton, Crystal Palace and West Brom. The Canaries tumbled down the mine and gave the rest a chance by capitulating at Fulham. The other three were staying up at various points across the afternoon. Saints were ahead against Manchester United but were pegged back and then lost. Palace came from behind to lead Charlton before Jonathan Fortune’s late equaliser. West Brom started the day bottom, were stranded at Christmas and needed the rest to slip up, but capitalised through Geoff Horsfield and Kieran Richardson in the second half against Portsmouth. Some Pompey fans filtered onto the Hawthorns pitch upon realising that their defeat had helped relegate Southampton.",
      "It was absolute perfection that almost overshadowed Stuart Pearce sending David James on up front instead of actual striker Jon Macken as Manchester City chased a result in a UEFA Cup decider against Middlesbrough.",
      "",
      "4) 2002/03\nOn the line this time was Roman Abramovich’s heart. The media had dubbed Chelsea and Liverpool’s Champions League qualification showdown as ‘the £20m match’ but that barely covered a fraction of what was ultimately on offer.",
      "The Blues were fourth and had the Reds pipped on goal difference heading into a ludicrously poised last match at Stamford Bridge – winner takes all. Chelsea faced financial ruin if they failed. Sami Hyypia opened the scoring but Marcel Desailly almost immediately responded. Jesper Gronkjaer completed the turnaround within the half-hour and in doing so, intrinsically changed Chelsea’s future.",
      "Blackburn secured a UEFA Cup spot ahead of Everton by beating Tottenham 4-0, while the Toffees inevitably lost 2-1 to Manchester United despite Kevin Campbell’s best efforts.",
      "In terms of relegation, West Brom and Sunderland were adrift. It became a case of one out of three joining them, despite Leeds, Bolton and West Ham all having reached That Magical 40-point Mark. Leeds beat Aston Villa 3-1. Bolton beat Boro 2-1. West Ham could only draw 2-2 with Birmingham as they became Too Good To Go Down poster boys.",
      "",
      "3) 2021/22\nA vintage slice of final-day Barclays. Manchester City produced a title-winning conclusion mad enough to be the second maddest final day they’ve had, while Leeds leapfrogged Burnley to avoid the drop and, most astonishingly of all, Spurs never even threatened to Spurs things up for a single second as they cruised back into the Champions League.",
      "Of course, most eyes were fixed on the Etihad when all they had to do, with a one-point lead at the summit, was not balls it up against Villa. Not this brilliant Villa inspired by one of the greatest managerial upgrades ever; Steven Gerrard’s Villa. On paper, it should have been a procession. But City unexpectedly fell behind to Matty Cash and, while recklessly searching for an equaliser, they went 2-0 down thanks to Philippe Coutinho.",
      "Gerrard and Coutinho winning the title for Liverpool? Oh Lord.",
      "But Liverpool were struggling to take care of their own business. They were level with Wolves all the while City opened the door. Never once during the afternoon did the Reds move to the summit. By the time Mo Salah had come off the bench to put them ahead at Anfield, City had done a six-minute madness and the title was staying at the Etihad.",
      "The only significant last-day twist came at the bottom where Leeds, at Brentford, had to better Burnley’s result at home to Newcastle to leapfrog the Clarets and condemn them to relegation. Both games finished 2-1 in favour of Leeds, who went down with Sam Allardyce the following season anyway as Burnley climbed back up.",
      "",
      "2) 1994/95\nYou know exactly where this is going. It was, by definition of it subjectively being ranked second here, not the greatest of Premier League final days, but it was the first truly spectacular, fabric-altering one. It really was breathtaking when Brian Deane rifled in an excellent goal to equalise against Tottenham and secure the point Leeds needed to pip Newcastle to the last UEFA Cup place.",
      "There was a modicum of drama elsewhere. Jamie Redknapp scored a sublime last-gasp free-kick he dare not celebrate to beat Blackburn, the Premier League leaders who had been winning and heading for the title until John Barnes equalised in the 64th minute at Anfield. In doing so, Liverpool had betrayed club icon Kenny Dalglish and provided Manchester United with a gilt-edged chance.",
      "Alex Ferguson’s players had plenty of those against West Ham, of course. But let’s just say Ludek Miklosko need never buy his own pints in one half of Merseyside or Lancashire.",
      "",
      "1) 2011/12\nMartin Tyler receives some understandable criticism, such is his inherent bias against every team, but he absolutely nailed it here: that really was Aguerooooooooooooooo, and we surely will never see anything like this ever again. The most rudimentary explanation is that Manchester City had to only match Manchester United’s result at Sunderland when they hosted QPR to win their first Premier League title, and they did. That misses out a couple of key incidents and some absurd context but still.",
      "Chief conspiracy theorist Wayne Rooney covered the side of the bargain for Ferguson’s team with a routine back-post header at a pliably mid-table Sunderland. Pablo Zabaleta restored Manchester City’s advantage on goal difference with the opener against QPR. But Rangers, fuelled by a relegation battle and some residual resentment from manager Mark Hughes, sacked in acrimony by City two and a half years prior, took inexplicable control through Djibril Cisse and Jamie Mackie. It was the ultimate bottle job, until Edin Dzeko and some Argentinean fella staged a stoppage-time intervention.",
      "That alone would mark this final day out as the greatest. But there were layers playing out in the background, such as QPR staying up despite their own implosion and being able to freely celebrate with Manchester City as Bolton succumbed to a 77th-minute Jon Walters equaliser at Stoke. Arsenal gripped on to third place for dear life ahead of Tottenham, although it wasn’t until Chelsea won the Champions League six days later that Spurs learned fourth was only good enough for the Europa League. Because Spurs."

      "With season’s end now just around the corner, here’s a look at five managers who aren’t certain to take charge of their current clubs in the Premier League next campaign.",
      "Full disclosure: this has been quite significantly rewritten since we first had the idea before the Europa League final.",
      "",
      "Nuno Espirito Santo (Nottingham Forest)\nObviously and entirely a madness, this one, and perhaps the single most egregious example of a manager becoming the victim of his own success at any non-promoted side. Even Leicester waited until it actually had gone to sh*t to get rid of Claudio Ranieri after he delivered the title.",
      "Yet there is plenty of talk now that should Nottingham Forest end up seventh when the music stops on Sunday afternoon then Nuno’s position could come under threat.",
      "There is absolutely no denying that finishing ‘only’ seventh from where they were a month ago would represent a disappointment and opportunity missed, but even allowing for the inevitable shifting of targets and expectations it seems utterly wild that Nuno could come under any pressure at all after a season that in the round remains a huge overachievement for a team that spent much of the last one in dire relegation trouble.",
      "But the fact it would be batsh*t doesn’t mean it won’t happen. Easy to forget it for much of this season, but Forest are quite batsh*t. Nuno is their eighth permanent manager in the last decade and already the second longest-serving.",
      "Owner Evangelos Marinakis is an emotional and volatile guy, and we’ve already seen him storming the pitch, brandishing his iPhone 7 and wired earphones, to admonish Nuno in the most public fashion possible after an admittedly quite irritating 2-2 draw with Leicester.",
      "Absolutely do not rule this out if Sunday doesn’t go to plan.",
      "",
      "Ruben Amorim (Man United)\nWe had two fairly strong convictions heading into the Europa League final: that Ruben Amorim was safe either way, and that Ange Postecoglou was doomed either way.",
      "We might have been wrong about both of those. Because it’s not just that Spurs won the final, it’s that Postecoglou so thoroughly won the battle of the managers as well, sitting Amorim down emphatically.",
      "The damning thing for Amorim is that when United are bad – and that is alarmingly often, including in the game they had decided many months ago was the one that would define their season – he is guilty of everything Ange stands accused of: stubborn, rigid adherence to a set way of doing things even when it’s demonstrably not working and the players aren’t buying into it.",
      "And while United played all their hits in Bilbao, never remotely looking like a team, defending incompetently, disappearing when the pressure was on, it was Ange and Spurs who showed the willingness to adapt and take the pragmatic approach to the reality in front of them.",
      "Shorn of their own main creative outlets, Spurs adopted a low-block-and-counter approach against United that they had deployed equally effectively to varying degrees when also keeping clean sheets in key knockout games at Eintracht Frankfurt and Bodo/Glimt.",
      "Amorim’s one concession to any deviation from his set plan appears to be ‘Chuck Harry Maguire up front and lump it in the mixer’. Look, we don’t hate it as, say, a Plan J or K and it is undeniably on occasion effective.",
      "But as a sole Plan B it’s, frankly, pish.",
      "Whoever lost the final was going to be in a bleak place after what was one of the highest-stakes games it’s possible to imagine given the extent to which both sides had sacked off everything else for this one night.",
      "There are different ways to lose, though. And United picked the worst possible one: an almost total failure to turn up at all against opposition with obvious, punishable frailties both deep-rooted and superficial, both physical and mental.",
      "Amorim got his selection wrong. Then he got his subs – or rather lack of subs – wrong. Bruno Fernandes had a horrible game and that’s a thing that can happen to any player at any time, fair enough, but did Amorim’s deployment of him in such a deep-lying position against such a deep-set opponent really give his best player his best chance to exert the influence and control of which he is capable?",
      "The indications are that United will continue with Amorim, and that’s to be expected for Sunk Cost FC. There is still a very fair argument that he deserves a summer to at least try and instil his ideas – and as importantly his players – in the squad.",
      "But the fact he so obviously needs a full summer only highlights what a complete pig’s anus United made of the whole thing in failing to act decisively last summer and then bringing in that kind of manager mid-season.",
      "And Amorim’s own decision to ignore his gut and make a mid-season move already looks like one of the worst judgement calls in recent times. Because there are no guarantees this yet represents rock-bottom for a broken football club.",
      "",
      "Ange Postecoglou (Tottenham)\nHas pulled off one of the great season-long pranks by doing what he said he would from the start and winning Tottenham a trophy in his second season.",
      "But the absolute and total sacrifice of Tottenham’s league form to facilitate that potentially transformative banter-ending win means that doubts about his long-term viability and suitability remain.",
      "We’ve changed our tune and declared that he deserves the chance to prove he’s learned the lessons of this season, that adaptability and pragmatism need not always be dirty words, and see if he can apply those knockout learnings to the more humdrum workaday business of the league.",
      "David Ornstein, though, is a man who knows his onions regarding these matters and he remains of the view that the Spurs board remain of a mind to follow through on their planned change of course this summer.",
      "That’s going to be a harder sell for Daniel Levy to a newly enchanted fanbase than it might have been.",
      "Whatever direction it takes, a genuinely fascinating summer awaits now at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium given the unexpected and vast opportunities that have just presented themselves.",
      "",
      "Enzo Maresca (Chelsea)\nFeels like more rests on Sunday’s final Premier League day than next Wednesday’s Europa Conference final, at least with regard to Maresca’s own future.",
      "Winning the Conference has long felt close to an inevitability for a Chelsea side absurdly overpowered compared to its opposition. In a year when the 16th and 17th best teams in England have been able to dominate the Europa League, Chelsea had absolutely no wriggle room in the third-tier competition.",
      "What matters surely for Maresca now is returning Chelsea to the Champions League. However slapdash and unfocused their spending may be, it is spending at a level that demands that platform. Really, it demands a title challenge of some kind.",
      "Even when Chelsea appeared capable of delivering such a challenge, Maresca insisted they couldn’t. It always felt vaguely self-interested and also perhaps slightly self-fulfilling. For a manager who came into the job to a chorus of doubts surrounding his total lack of top-flight managerial experience it didn’t exactly inspire confidence that he understood the assignment.",
      "A late pick-up in league form has slightly quietened the noise around Maresca’s future, but the fact remains that he is yet to ensure he even matches Mauricio Pochettino’s sixth-place effort from last season, and a stunning run of form to end the season couldn’t save the Argentinean 12 months ago.",
      "",
      "Scott Parker (Burnley)\nMuch of the arguments here apply equally as clearly if slightly more harshly to Daniel Farke who has delivered the Championship title for Leeds.",
      "The concern with both promoted managers is that we already knew they were very good Championship managers, but equally all the evidence we have points to them being rotten top-flight ones.",
      "Farke, though, having delivered better results in more striking fashion, dodges the final spot on this list in favour of Parker, whose often grim sufferball tactics to steer Burnley to promotion don’t suggest a thrilling bid for Premier League survival is in store.",
      "Just as teams who get promoted playing great free-flowing attacking football – like Burnley’s last promoted team under Vincent Kompany – find the step up unmanageable, we fear that a team that has gone so far the other way will be equally exposed by the step up.",
      "There has to be a middle ground, and we have little confidence Parker can find it at a level that has already proved beyond him before."

      "His brother Roberto also criticized Amorim on social media, accusing the manager of “thrown under the bus” by not starting him in Wednesday’s final.",
      "Garnacho’s relationship with Amorim has had ups and downs. He was dropped alongside Marcus Rashford for the Manchester derby in December but later regained some trust.",

      "Man Utd’s financial situation is nowhere near as troublesome as penny-pinching Sir Jim Ratcliffe would like us to think, with a recent report from The Times claiming defeat to Spurs on Wednesday night would leave them with a summer budget of £100m, which would increase to £205m should Marcus Rashford (£40m), Antony (£40m) and Jadon Sancho (£25m) exit permanently following their respective loans this season.",

Instead, let’s work off the assumption that the Blues buy and immediately sell the major flop (and Rashford and Antony’s improved form seals their permanent exits) to ensure the Red Devils have a healthy enough budget to at least set up a climb to mid-table from the fringes of relegation.",
      "It is not realistic to expect United to upgrade every position (as is required) in a singular window, so we have focused on six priorities for the club to address this summer as a combined possible investment of £202.7m would afford Amorim (or his successor) a far stronger squad than the current dross…",

      "Rayan Cherki (£33.7m)\nA huge factor behind Man Utd’s miserable season is that an already poor squad has been made to look even worse by it not being equipped to maximise Amorim’s 3-4-3 formation.",
      "The No.10 role is a key position in this set-up. While Amad Diallo and Mason Mount, to varying degrees, have proved their ability to thrive there under Amorim, one or two reinforcements are required to add goals and quality depth, especially with unsuited Alejandro Garnacho surely sealing his exit with his post-match outburst on Wednesday night.",

      "Still, Cunha’s stance on a move to Old Trafford is a huge boost with the club crying out for any semblance of positivity, as his supreme displays for Wolves indicate that he should be a sure-fire success at Old Trafford. If he flops, everyone there should pack up and go home.",

      "Joshua Zirkzee had a dire couple of months but showed real promise before picking up his thigh injury. He should be above exit-bound Hojlund in Amorim’s thinking, though there is an argument to suggest his Dimitar Berbatov-esque style makes him more suited to the head coach’s No.10 role rather than a standalone No.9.",

      "Ideally, they would sign a more proven striker (i.e. Viktor Gyokeres) to combine with Delap next season, but their inability to freely spend as other positions require attention means they will have to settle for the Englishman, who would still be an upgrade on current options.",

      "If reports are to be believed, Garcia is expected to join Arsenal to compete with David Raya next season, but he would be fighting a losing battle at the Emirates and would get much more game time at Man Utd.",
      "Garcia has sparkled in a poor Espanyol team, with his £25m release clause to fall to only £12.5m if they are relegated on the final day of the La Liga season. With his side two points clear of safety amid a five-game losing streak, that is entirely plausible.",

      "Barring January signing Patrick Dorgu, Man Utd’s current wing-back options are certainly in the full-back category, and they need a new right-sider to make Amorim’s team more balanced and effective.

      "The 0.92 points-per-game Amorim has won this season after Erik ten Hag and Ruud van Nistelrooy got them to 15 from the first 11 games between them would have seen United claim just shy of 35 points across a 38-game season, which would have seen them relegated in 11 Premier League campaigns this century and is the worst record after 26 games of any manager of the traditional ‘big six’ clubs.",
      "",
      "Subjectively ‘the worst’\n“We are being the worst team maybe in the history of Manchester United.” Straight from the horse’s mouth. And while Amorim’s mastery of self-deprecation over the last few months is something to be admired – at least he knows they’re sh*t – that shouldn’t obscure our view or cause us to lose sight of the fact that they are really, really sh*t.",
      "There were widespread complaints across the fanbase over the football played under pretty much every manager since Sir Alex Ferguson retired, but there was always something to hang your hat on: Fight under Jose Mourinho; rigidity under Louis van Gaal; chaos under Ole Gunner Solskjaer. It was never good enough, but it was sometimes good, sometimes fine and sometimes bad. This is almost all bad.",
      "",
      "What is his philosophy?\nCan you tell us what Amorim’s philosophy is without referring to what he did at Sporting? After six months – six months – we don’t even know what Manchester United’s style is supposed to be. It’s 3-4-3, we sure as sh*t know that. But are Manchester United a possession-based team? What kind of pressing does he want? How high is their defensive line meant to be? Should the wide centre-backs be stepping into midfield? What’s the job of the inverted wingers?",
      "We don’t know and the players appear to have even less of an idea. Also, any chance of a novel set-piece? Y’know, some evidence of coaching. Cheers.",
      "",
      "Refusal to change\nWe wonder if Amorim has had even the slightest wobble over his dedication to stay true to what worked at Sporting through half a year of that not working in any way, shape or form at Old Trafford.",
      "The blame for this obsession with footballing principles is often aimed at Pep Guardiola, but the Manchester City side that won the Treble is a far cry from his Barcelona side and even his early winning teams at the Etihad. Mikel Arteta has tweaked and adapted in five seasons at Arsenal. And Arne Slot has proven the value in making not insignificant changes to Liverpool’s style and system, not just across the season but during games to walk to the Premier League title.",
      "Surely a manager who can play in multiple different ways, albeit with a few non-negotiables, is just unequivocally better than a manager who can’t. Even the most principled manager perhaps in the history of the Premier League ripped up his own rule book to get the better of Amorim and beat United to the Europa League title.",
      "",
      "Failure to coach players to fit the system\nWe understand the excuse of these United players not being good enough. They’re a damn sight better than 16th in the Premier League, but for a team that’s historically won and challenged for major titles, it’s a fair point. We also understand that many of them, seemingly most of them, do not suit Amorim’s system. They’ve got full-backs who aren’t wing-backs, wingers instead of inverted wingers, etc etc.",
      "What we neither understand nor accept is that the majority of them can’t be coached to suit the system. They may not be their ideal positions, but surely they can be coached to improve in roles that exist in Amorim’s XI rather than being cast out before thriving away from Manchester United, as Antony and Marcus Rashford have done this season.",
      "We’re surprised Roy Keane hasn’t told Amorim ‘it’s his job’ yet.",
      "",
      "Money required to buy players to fit the system\nPut yourself in Sir Jim Ratcliffe’s shoes for a moment (horrible, right?) and imagine what it must be like to be told by your manager, whom you’ve hired through no little expense, that 90 per cent of the players you pay the wages of aren’t suited to his system and so aren’t in his plans moving forward.",
      "What in your mind would be the path of least resistance? Sign five or six players this summer and another five or six next summer for £400m or whatever that would cost, or sack the manager and get someone in who could put these players to better use?",
      "Amorim has admitted that he’s asking for “faith” he’s neither earned nor deserves and having spent £200m on Erik ten Hag’s players last summer after their worst-ever Premier League season before sacking him a couple of months later – which Ratcliffe himself acknowledges was a mistake – it would be the definition of insanity to do exactly the same thing again.",
      "",
      "He’s a loser\nOk, it’s not exactly the same thing because Ten Hag won a trophy at the end of his miserable campaign while Amorim lost the Europa League final at the end of his even more miserable campaign.",
      "We thoroughly enjoyed the Class of ’92 pundits insisting Manchester United would win on Wednesday having lost three times already to Tottenham this season through ‘logic’ amounting to nothing more than their typical This Is Manchester United b*llocks.",
      "Presumably they and the rest of us can now finally accept that This Is Not Manchester United after they lost an actual final to actual Spurs and make judgements on a team’s chances of winning something based on how good they are at football rather than through rubbing crystal skulls and tracking the position of the moon in the week leading up to it.",
      "And for that, Mr Amorim, we thank you.",
      "",
      "Available managers\nWe’re not about to suggest that anyone could replace Amorim and mount anything close to a title challenge, but there will definitely be a few we would back to make a decent fist of what currently looks like the club’s impossible target Ratcliffe has set of sixth in the Premier League next season.",
      "We would love to see Simone Inzaghi at Old Trafford and believe his and Inter’s policy of signing experienced players with something to prove would be an excellent method of righting the United ship. But that’s not going to happen, because a) why would he leave Inter for United? and b) United aren’t about to pay the compensation.",
      "There are several very capable available managers though: Xavi, Marco Rose, Max Allegri, Edin Terzic. The question will be whether they could attract any of them like a moth to the flames of their dumpster fire. They could always reignite their interest in Gary O’Neil.",
      "",
      "‘Untouchables’ to get-the-f***-out-of-our-club-ables\nYou might have seen the scarves – the ones with the faces of Rasmus Hojlund, Alejandro Garnacho and Kobbie Mainoo on them along with some sort of tagline hailing them as the future of Manchester United. They were The Untouchables ahead of the 2024 summer transfer window – the only players they would not listen to offers for.",
      "The fact that Andre Onana and Diogo Dalot have had the same moniker bestowed upon them at points in the meantime shows just how insecure that sacrosanct status can be, but we never would have guessed a year ago that by the start of the 2025-26 season not one of Hojlund, Garnacho or Mainoo would still be at the club and that’s a very real possibility.",
      "And it’s not because of PSR. Garnacho and Mainoo would both be ‘pure profit’ sales, but they would have been last summer too, and there’s absolutely no chance United would let them go if Amorim wanted to keep them given the extraordinary lack of players in his squad he has any faith in whatsoever.",
      "They’ve both got flaws, sure, but United used to be a place where flawed players became infallible, where immaturity would make way for professionalism and dominance. If United’s goal is to sign players whose value can increase through their time at the club then they’ve got to have a manager willing and able to nurture them through that process.",
      "",
      "No compensation\nHe’s f***ing asking for it, mate. No “conversation about compensation”? That’s a red or white flag depending how you look at it. Put him out of his misery and bring the next poor b*stard in.",

      "“He has to win eight out of 10 or 90% of the games at the start of the season, that’s how long ten Hag was given (sacked after nine league and one EFL cup games on October 28th),” Meulensteen told Tipman Tips.",

      "Sunday 25 May 2025 21:43, UK",
      "Aston Villa have made an official complaint to the PGMOL over the selection of referee Thomas Bramall for their Premier League final-day match against Man Utd, which Champions League-chasing Villa lost after having a goal controversially ruled out.",
      "The defeat saw Villa finish sixth in the league, meaning they missed out on Champions League football next season when just a point would have seen them secure the top-five finish necessary to qualify.",
      "After the first-half sending-off of goalkeeper Emi Martinez, Villa's 10 players thought they had taken the lead in the second half when Morgan Rogers poked the ball free from Altay Bayindir and curled the ball into an open net, only for Bramall to disallow the goal for an alleged foul on the United goalkeeper.",
      "The referee awarded a free kick to United with Bayindir deemed to be in control of the ball before Rogers gained possession, only for replays to show he did not have both hands on the ball when Rogers poked it away. Because Bramall blew his whistle before Rodgers' shot crossed the goalline, VAR was unable to intervene.",
      "Villa were down to 10 after Emi Martinez's red card late in the first half, but thought they went ahead midway through the second with the game still at 0-0.",
      "Under little pressure, Man Utd keeper Altay Bayindir made a mess of sliding onto the ball in his box. Villa's Morgan Rogers dislodged the ball before swivelling and firing into the empty net, seemingly giving the visitors the lead. At the time, the goal would have seen Villa climb into the Champions League places with less than 20 minutes left on the final day of the season.",
      "The goal was disallowed by referee Thomas Bramall, who adjudged Rogers to have kicked the ball out of Bayindir's grasp. However, replays show the United 'keeper had lost possession before Rogers' intervention.",
      "Because Bramall blew the whistle before the goal was scored, VAR could not intervene and the goal did not stand.",
      "Amad Diallo scored for Man Utd three minutes later before Christian Eriksen's penalty doubled United's advantage in the 87th minute. The 2-0 loss at Old Trafford meant Villa missed out on Champions League qualification on goal difference, while a point would have been enough to lift them into fifth following Newcastle's 1-0 defeat to Everton.",
      "On Sunday evening Villa confirmed a complaint had been made, saying: \"Aston Villa can confirm the club has written to the PGMOL to raise concerns over the selection process of match officials following today's game with Manchester United at Old Trafford.",
      "\"With such high stakes surrounding today's fixture, the club believe a more experienced referee should have been appointed. Of the 10 referees to officiate across the Premier League today, Mr. Bramall was the second least experienced.",
      "\"The decision to disallow Morgan Rogers' goal, which would have given the club a 1-0 lead with 17 minutes remaining in the match, was a major contributing factor to the club not qualifying for the Champions League.",
      "\"As per the standards that have been established over the course of the season, a decision to whistle early is clearly inconsistent with current refereeing guidelines. VAR exists to ensure that these types of situations receive the scrutiny they deserve. Unfortunately, the technology was not allowed to serve its purpose.",
      "\"Ultimately, we acknowledge that the outcome for us will not change, but we believe that it is important to address the selection methodology to ensure that high stakes matches are treated as such with regards to officiating and to ensure that the implemented VAR technology is allowed to be effective.\"",
      "Bramall has officiated 11 games in the top-flight of English football this season and 17 other match officials have taken charge of more fixtures than him throughout the 2024/25 campaign.",
      "\"The complaint is not about the decision,\" Villa's director of football operations Damian Vidagany said post-match. \"The complaint is about the selection of the referees. One of the most inexperienced referees for one of the most difficult matches of the season involving another four or five teams.",
      "\"It's not about the decision. The decision is clear. It's a mistake. The referee apologised for the mistake. We can do nothing. The problem is why the experienced international referees were not here today.\"",
      "\"The referee's call was a free-kick to Manchester United with Bayindir deemed to be in control of the ball before Rogers gained possession,\" read a Premier League match centre statement on X.",
      "\"The whistle was blown by the referee before the ball entered the goal, therefore the incident was not reviewable by the VAR.\"",
      "\"The goal (being) disallowed was the key moment but overall they deserve it more. We were resilient with one player less and we could score one goal. It was a good opportunity to continue being resilient and keep the result.",
      "\"I speak to the referee and he knows it (was a mistake). But I don't want to speak about VAR.",
      "\"We go to Europa League but we were close to Champions League. Our objective (at the start of the season) was to be in Europe, and we have to be happy and proud with what we did.\"",
      "Villa captain John McGinn has slammed the \"incredible\" decision to rule out Rogers' goal at Old Trafford during the 2-0 defeat which cost the visitors a spot in the Champions League.",
      "\"No one in the dressing room or watching felt like we deserved to win. Man Utd were the better team but the decision is incredible.",
      "\"Everyone, when VAR was implemented, wanted correct decisions. I know it is the rule but it is so hard to take, especially with the impact it has on us.",
      "\"To whistle at that point, it is hard to take. All you need is a point to get into the Champions League.\""

      "Man Utd:  Bayindir (5), Lindelof (6), Maguire (6), Heaven (6), Mazraoui (6), Casemiro (7), Fernandes (7), Dorgu (6), Amad (8), Mount (7), Hojlund (5).\n\n\nSubs used: Dalot (n/a), Mainoo (7), Eriksen (7), Evans (6), Obi (n/a).\n\n\nAston Villa: Martinez (5), Cash (4), Konsa (6), Pau (5), Maatsen (5), Kamara (6), Onana (7), McGinn (6), Asensio (6), Rogers (6), Watkins (6).\n\n\nSubs used: Olsen (6), Tielemans (6), Ramsey (6), Malen (n/a), Barkley (n/a).\n\n\nPlayer of the match: Amad Diallo.",
      "Unai Emery's side came into the final day knowing that even a win might not be good enough, but with Newcastle losing to Everton, a draw would have been enough in the end. But Amad's header and Eriksen's 87th-minute penalty ended their hopes.",
      "For United, it was a welcome fillip after the disappointment of their Europa League final defeat to Tottenham in Bilbao on Wednesday. This was their first victory over a team that will still be in the Premier League next season since they won at Fulham in January.",
      "But the focus will be on Villa, denied Champions League football next season as a result of this defeat - and a call which left them fuming.",
      "Aston Villa intend to make an official complaint to the Premier League that a more experienced referee was not selected to officiate a game of such magnitude.",
      "Speaking alongside Unai Emery in the post-match press conference, Villa's director of football operations Damian Vidagany confirmed that the complaint would focus on the selection of Bramall to officiate the match, with Champions League football on the line.",
      "\"The complaint is not about the decision,\" said Vidagany. \"The complaint is about the selection of the referees. One of the most inexperienced referees for one of the most difficult matches of the season involving another four or five teams.",
      "\"It's not about the decision. The decision is clear. It's a mistake. The referee apologised for the mistake. We can do nothing. The problem is why the experienced international referees were not here today.\"",
      "\"The key moment was of course the goal of Morgan Rogers and how the referee decided the action. He whistled and of course he needed to have it under his control. I spoke with the referee and he knows his mistake.",
      "We make mistakes every day, I do as well. I believe in VAR and I think we have very good referees in the Premier League but sometimes they make a mistake.",
      "\"With this goal maybe we could get a better result and a Champions League position but we did not deserve more than the result we have.\"",
      "Speaking to the Manchester United supporters on the pitch after the game, Ruben Amorim addressed his team's struggles and told them the good days are coming.",
      "\"First of all, I want to apologise for this season. I know you are very disappointed with me and with the team,\" he said.",
      "\"Secondly, I want to say thank you. We are very grateful for your support over the season, which I know was really bad.",
      "\"It was really hard in many games but now we have to make a choice. Stay stuck in the past, because this season is in the past, it is over. We fight each other, or we stick together and move forward.",
      "\"Six months ago, in my first three games in charge, with two victories and one draw, I said to you, the storm is coming. Today, after this disastrous season, I want to tell you, the good days are coming.",
      "\"If there is one club in the world that can overcome any situation, any disaster, it's our club. It's Manchester United.",
      "\"Now I want to say sorry also to my players, sometimes I was not fair, but I try always to be honest with you guys.",
      "\"Thank you very much, see you next season.\""

      "Gary Neville says Ruben Amorim must end the \"negativity spiral\" at Manchester United and \"get a grip\" of the club after a nightmare season.",
      "After that defeat, United defender Luke Shaw said: \"All of us have to question ourselves. Are we good enough to be here? Because for this club, this season it's not acceptable. We know that and it's down to us.\"",
      "Neville believes those comments are an alarming reflection of how the players are feeling and Amorim must swiftly move to correct the culture in the club and dressing room if he is to achieve a significant improvement next season.",
      "\"I want to point towards Luke Shaw's interview, where he talked about, 'we've got to look ourselves in the mirror and decide whether we're good enough to play for Manchester United',\" said Neville on The Overlap show It's Called Soccer.",
      "\"Luke, it's not your job to determine that. A player at Manchester United should have no control as to whether they're there or not. The manager of the football club decides whether you're good enough to play in that football team.",
      "\"When the players are starting to come out and question publicly whether they're good enough to play for the club, you know how bad it is internally there. You imagine what they're saying to each other inside.",
      "\"I have this thing about negativity spiral in my businesses, in my life. If I hear the energy-sapping negativity spiral starting to move, whereby you can feel people starting to have an influence over the others, and Luke's an experienced player now, honestly, I think you've got to wipe it out. You've got to wipe out every single player in that dressing room who doesn't believe that they've got total and utter confidence to play for that football club.",
      "\"There were some players on that pitch and some players on the bench who I think can still do a good job for Manchester United. I don't believe it's a case of get rid of them all. I think there's some talent in there. I believe that. And this idea that they don't care, I'll repeat what I've said many, many times again, never, ever think that of football players.",
      "\"Do they want to lose football matches? Do they want to be criticised on social media? The answer is no. They do care. They've worked thousands of hours to get to this position of playing for the club, but the club is eating them alive. The club is eating them alive, it's too big for them.\"",
      "Neville called on Amorim to take swift action this summer, comparing the situation to how Mikel Arteta has played a big role in the overhaul at Arsenal in recent years.",
      "\"Someone's got to get a grip of that club, and I think it has to be the manager. Ruben, you've got to get a grip of that club,\" said Neville.",
      "\"Mikel Arteta's done a great job at Arsenal. From day one, he imprinted his standards on the club, he put the coaching systems in place, there's been progression all the way through, and he's got five years now under his belt, six years under his belt.",
      "\"Ruben Amorim needs to look at next season, how he gets into the top six, how he basically wipes half that squad out, how he transforms it into a dynamic team that plays exciting football from the rigid stuff that we're currently watching, and he needs to think about which players in that dressing room can do a job for him.",

      "There has been no direct contact yet between United and Wolves but those formalities are anticipated once the season has closed.",
      "Cunha thinks United are one of the biggest clubs in the world and their current Premier League position - they are currently currently two places beneath Wolves in 16th - would not put him off a potential move to Old Trafford.",

      "\"Manchester United are desperate in that position. You think of what Manchester United are playing now, they've let Jadon Sancho go, they've let [Marcus] Rashford go, they've let Antony go, so three players who are natural players who travel with the ball.",
      "\"They're playing with [Alejandro] Garnacho at the moment but then they're lopsided. On the other side, sometimes it's [Joshua] Zirkzee when he was fit, or they've got Bruno Fernandes stepping up in moments. Mason Mount's come in there but they need someone who can beat players, they need someone who's equally as good running through the middle with the ball and travelling with the ball, and go out wide and support the wing-back.",
      "\"So he's a type of player that you could see Manchester United being interested in, that would suit this system that Ruben Amorim wants to play.",
      "\"They've lost three players who play in that type of position so they need to fulfil that, they'll need to fill those roles definitely or else they're going to struggle.",
      "\"They need to score goals. Ruben Amorim said at the weekend we're just struggling to score goals, so you need players who can take risks, good in the final third, and Cunha's got a lot of ability.\"",
      "On concerns about Cunha's character: \"No. To be honest, I quite like [it]. If I were playing against him, I wouldn't like a player with a bit of spirit and a bit of fight.",
      "\"I used to play with some unbelievable players, some of the very best in the world at their time, and they had the right spike to them - you think about Wayne Rooney, Carlos Tevez, Eric Cantona and Mark Hughes and how tough and sometimes spirited they were in games.",
      "\"Sometimes they did the unpredictable, sometimes they lost their discipline, but they were amazing players. At the time that they get sent off, they know they've let the team down, but what they give you in return is something special and I love a player with character.\"",
      "Speaking to Cunha at Wolves' training ground last summer, it was a chance to ask him how important it is for him to feel like he is having fun on the football pitch. \"I do not want to go on the pitch and be a robot,\" he replied. \"I want to enjoy it.\"",
      "Watch Cunha play and that approach to the game shines through. At times, he can appear to wander where he chooses, making decisions off the cuff. But those decisions are often thrilling. He is a maverick in a sport that feels more and more coached.",
      "In the context of Gary Neville's comments about the recent Manchester derby being \"boring\" and the subsequent reports linking United with a move for the Brazilian forward, it all makes Cunha one of the more intriguing transfer targets of the summer window.",
      "Why? Because on one level, Cunha makes perfect sense in one of those No 10 roles within Ruben Amorim's 3-4-3 system. He already plays there for Wolves. He can score goals but also create them for others. His £64m release fee offers clarity for United.",
      "On the other hand, there are questions about his temperament and while Cunha, who turns 26 in May, is at the right age to make the big move of his career, some will ask if he can adapt to the demands and deliver consistently within an organised pressing structure."

      "It had to be him. On the crucial final day of the season, Scott McTominay got Napoli's Serie A title parade going with the opening goal in a 2-0 win over Cagliari. It has been the story of his and the club's campaign.",
      "Earlier this season, the Scot was asked about what his favourite nickname among the Napoli fanbase is. He was given a selection - and two stood out.",
      "One was 'McFratm'. It's the Neapolitan word for 'brother' - the Napoli faithful now revere the 28-year-old as one of the family.",
      "The other nickname: 'apribottiglie'. It means bottle opener - handed to him due to the sheer number of times he has given Napoli the lead. He gets the party started. He did exactly that when his team needed it most in the 2-0 win against Cagliari on Friday night, when his team required one win to claim the title.",
      "Nicknames are a big deal at the Naples club. Before his departure to Paris Saint-Germain in January, Kvicha Kvaratskhelia's talents were so unique he earned the term 'Kvaradona'. It's some honour given Diego Maradona's status literally hangs over the club.",
      "But now McTominay is the one with hero status.",
      "And for good reason. Despite Kvaratskhelia's departure, the arrivals of Antonio Conte and Romelu Lukaku to the club over the past year, the Scottish midfielder is the main reason why Napoli have their hands on another Scudetto title.",
      "His 18 goal contributions is the most from a midfielder in a Serie A debut season. It’s three more than Kaka during his first term at AC Milan.",
      "And in Napoli's run-in, McTominay was the bottle opener, starting the scoring in three consecutive league games in April against Empoli, Monza and Torino.",
      "He has been crucial in picking up points during decisive matches all season, scoring in the first game against title rivals Inter - yes, that was an opener too.",
      "And even though Napoli limped over the line for the title during the back end of the season, McTominay more than played his part. He basically carried them through. For example, in the 2-2 draw with Genoa a fortnight ago, he set up both goals - again, to put them ahead.",
      "McTominay has been vital in this title-winning team, which some Manchester United fans may struggle to believe. Reliable and consistent? Yes. But two goals behind top scorer Lukaku?",
      "Not everyone is stunned by this. \"How you can sell Scott is beyond me,\" former United boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer said this season. McTominay also scored seven Premier League goals last season and was a penalty area threat under Erik ten Hag.",
      "But his 12 goals this season is one of many key metrics that have gone up since leaving Manchester United.",
      "One of them is minutes. McTominay has been trusted more by Napoli this term than in any season at Old Trafford - and even more so compared to Erik ten Hag's two full seasons at United.",
      "But there has been a position tweak too. At Napoli, McTominay has been handed a more attacking role, similar to his status as a No 10 for Scotland. In the 0-0 draw against Parma last week, he was even handed a role on the left wing - which of course used to be Kvaratskhelia's position.",
      "As a result, McTominay has been even more of an attacking presence. He has created twice as many chances in the league compared to last season at Manchester United.",
      "He takes players on five times as much as last term, while his pressing numbers have multiplied by more than four.",
      "Where was this at Old Trafford? Firstly, there is the feeling that McTominay was misunderstood as a player. The Scot was often used as a deeper midfield option at Old Trafford - sometimes even the deepest.",
      "A period playing as a centre-back for the Scotland national team didn't help United's cause - but how they failed to spot his potential higher up when Steve Clarke pushed him further up to being a regular goal threat.",
      "Of course, Bruno Fernandes was United's standout No 10 in McTominay's prominent years at United. But it only adds to the frustration of letting a talent like McTominay's go. He was not just misunderstood - but also overlooked.",
      "He is not the only United player currently revelling in success elsewhere while Ruben Amorim's side languish in crisis mode. McTominay has a Scudetto title to his name, Antony will take part in next week's Conference League final - which Jadon Sancho could be involved in as well.",
      "Dean Henderson has a FA Cup trophy to his name with Crystal Palace, while Anthony Elanga has justified his move to Nottingham Forest. Marcus Rashford looks better off and sharper at Aston Villa, with Tyrell Malacia a recently-crowned Dutch champion at PSV Eindhoven.",
      "None of the above will hurt more than McTominay though. This was a United academy product - and remember this club has had one of those in every matchday squad since 1937 - winning a major trophy elsewhere, after bidding an emotional goodbye to the club nearly a year ago.",
      "With Kobbie Mainoo and Alejandro Garnacho's futures also up in the air this summer, it will hit home as to whether United is an appropriate development ground for those that come through."
