      "Manchester United kicked off their pre-season with a 0-0 draw against Leeds in Sweden on Saturday. New signings Matheus Cunha and Diego Leon made their first appearances for the club during the game and more new faces are expected before the transfer window slams shut.",
      "Plenty of outgoings are also expected, with Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho, Antony, Alejandro Garnacho and Tyrell Malacia placed in the 'bomb squad' after manager Ruben Amorim decided they have no future at the club.",
      "Christian Eriksen and Victor Lindelof have already departed after their contracts expired, while veteran defender Jonny Evans has retired and taken up a new role as United's head of loans and pathways.",
      "Marcus Rashford is close to getting his dream move to Barcelona, with Spanish giants finalising a deal with Manchester United.",
      "Rashford spent the second half of last season on loan at Aston Villa after being frozen out by Ruben Amorim and the forward is now set to join Barcelona on loan with an option to buy after Hansi Flick approved a deal.",
      "Rashford has made no secret of his desire to join Barcelona, stating last month: \"Spain is nice, it's not too far from home. If I'm training over a long period, my family can come for a few days, it's a nice location and good weather.\"",
      "According to Italian outlet Sportmediaset, Juventus have reached a 'full agreement' with Jadon Sancho over personal terms as they hope to sign the winger.",
      "The report states that Juventus are also close to agreeing a deal with Manchester United, with the transfer expected to be finalised next week. It is claimed that Juventus are set to meet United's €25million (£21.6m) asking price.",
      "Sancho spent last season on loan at Chelsea, but the Blues decided to pay a £5m penalty fee to avoid signing him permanently.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo is set to join Manchester United in time for their pre-season trip to the US after an agreement was finally reached with Brentford.",
      "United fly out to Chicago on Tuesday and Mbeumo is expected to join them after a fee was agreed of £65m plus £6m in add-ons. Ruben Amorim also wants United to sign a new creative midfielder and a proven goalscorer this summer.",

      "Gary Lineker appears to approve of Marcus Rashford following in his footsteps at Barcelona. After weeks of doubt, Rashford is edging closer to sealing his dream move to Barca and out of Manchester United in the summer transfer window.",
      "Rashford made it clear that he is keen to join Barcelona ever since concluding a loan spell at Aston Villa. He rejected a mega-money move to Saudi Arabia and has been waiting patiently for Barca and United to come to terms over a move.",
      "The striker has been put in the ‘bomb squad’ at United by Ruben Amorim, who has made it clear he doesn’t have a future at the club. Forced to train alongside fellow unwanted stars Jadon Sancho, Alejandro Garnacho, Antony and Tyrell Malacia, he has placed his future in the hands of others.",
      "United had wanted to sell him permanently for around £40million, but they have now settled on a loan deal with Barca. The Catalan giants will take him on loan for the 2025/26 season, paying the entirety of his £325,000-a-week wages, before having the chance to sign him permanently if it goes well.",
      "That has excited Lineker, who has changed his Instagram photo to an image of the two players wearing the No.10 shirts for England while standing in front of No.10 Downing Street. Lineker is currently the only Englishman to have played for Barcelona since World War II, having led the line for the club between 1986 and 1989.",
      "He scored 51 goals in 138 games for Barca, helping them win the Copa del Rey, and will have an eye on how Rashford gets on in Hansi Flick’s side. Rashford is expected to play off the left of Barcelona’s 4-3-3 formation, although he can also provide back-up for veteran centre-forward Robert Lewandowski.",
      "Barca had tried to sign Nico Williams from Athletic Club, but the move fell through. They also showed an interest in Liverpool winger Luis Diaz, but were put off by the Reds’ transfer stance.",
      "“I don’t want to speak about players which are not in my team, but of course Luis Diaz and Marcus Rashford are fantastic players,” Flick said earlier in the summer. “I like them and we’ll see what happens.”",
      "Before returning to Carrington, Rashford had been working on his fitness by himself and issued a clear plea to Barca. While on holiday in Marbella, he was asked by Spanish YouTube channel XBuyer whether he wants to play with Barca wonderkid Lamine Yamal in the future.",
      "\"Yeah, sure. Everybody in the world wants to play with the best,\" the forward replied. \"So hopefully, we'll see.\" He got four goals and six assists in 17 appearances for Villa before an injury cut short his stay in Birmingham.",

      "Rasmus Hojlund showed his disgust after Diogo Dalot failed to find him with a pass in Manchester United’s friendly against Leeds on Saturday. United drew 0-0 with the newly-promoted Premier League side in Stockholm in a drab start to their pre-season campaign.",
      "Ruben Amorim gave an unofficial debut to £62.5million signing Matheus Cunha, who was one of the only positive takeaways from the match. Otherwise it followed a familiar theme for the club, who finished a lowly 15th last season and are expected to improve in 2025/26.",
      "Hojlund managed 10 goals in 52 appearances for United last season, only four of which came in the league, and he often cut a frustrated figure up front. That continued on Saturday in the Swedish capital – and the Danish striker wasn’t shy in letting his team-mates know.",
      "Hojlund was looking for Dalot to pass the ball in behind the Leeds defence, but it came later than he wanted it, meaning he was likely offside. \"F*** sake,\" he yelled in Dalot’s direction. The Portuguese full-back wasn’t interested in hearing his moans and simply ignored him and jogged on.",
      "The lack of a link-up between the two United players was evident later in the game too. Dalot did find Hojlund with a cross, only for his header to be deflected, while the young striker was shouting at Dalot again later on after he opted to pass to Patrick Dorgu instead of him.",
      "This is a make or break pre-season for Amorim, but he clearly isn’t concerned about the atmosphere around the squad, who are missing Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho, Antony, Tyrell Malacia and Alejandro Garnacho, who have been banished.",
      "\"The environment is really good, of course sometimes we are going to struggle, but what I felt in the first moment is that if we are going to struggle, we will struggle together,\" Amorim told MUTV post-match.",
      "\"That is the beginning of everything, then we have to put the quality. This club is not just about the effort, it's about the quality, we have to win games.\"",
      "He added: \"We need to create that bond between everybody [on the United States tour] - not just between the players but the staff. All the changes are stopping. We need to leave that as a group. We have a lot to improve, the speed of the game, all of the details. We need to improve.\"",
      "Amorim was clear on what the main problem was. \"We have a lack of pace,” he said. “Especially in the middle of the park, you can feel it's hard to bring the ball. We created chances. We have a lot to do but it was a first test against a Premier League team with two different teams, a good test.",
      "\"Matheus Cunha showed what we need, a player in between the lines who is really aggressive. We watched that during last season for a different team. We expect the same thing.",
      "\"You can see the connection with him and Bruno Fernandes is still not there. But it will be a good connection, because you can put a player like Kobbie Mainoo or Mason Mount there. We need to increase our quality in the final third.\"",

      "As a result, Altay Bayindir and Heaton were both given 45 minutes to impress in United's first pre-season friendly, a 0-0 draw with Leeds in Sweden. And Heaton impressed after replacing Bayindir for the second half, making a pair of important saves to keep out efforts from Jayden Bogle and Largie Ramazani.",

      "Ruben Amorim left Manchester United’s bomb squad at home - but the players he’s ready to put his faith in look far from explosive. Amorim used the first game of pre-season to give no fewer than 24 players a run-out in the Stockholm sunshine after ordering Marcus Rashford and the rest of his misfits to stay behind at Old Trafford.",
      "There were debuts for £62.5million Matheus Cunha and £7million Diego Leon in the Strawberry Arena. Bryan Mbeumo will join the squad in the United States this week after the Reds agreed to meet Brentford’s £70million valuation of the Cameroon international almost two months after the London club made it clear their asking price was non-negotiable.",
      "Amorim will now be hoping that Sir Jim Ratcliffe will free up some cash to sign the goal-scoring striker he craves after Barcelona opened talks about taking Rashford to Spain for the season with a £50million option to buy making the deal a no-brainer for United.",
      "If they can also raise some cash by flogging Jadon Sancho, Antony, Alejandro Garnacho and Tyrell Malacia then perhaps there will be even more wriggle room for new recruits. United certainly need the rebuild to continue at pace.",
      "Amorim was only spared a relegation battle last season by the dire form of the three promoted clubs who eventually went down. There was certainly no obvious gap in quality between the two different teams he sent out in each half to face Daniel Farke’s Football League champions.",
      "A pedestrian first period ended with Casemiro’s cross flicking off Leeds skipper Ethan Ampadu and glancing the crossbar. But after the kick-off had to be delayed by 10 minutes due to crowd congestion, thrills and spills were at a premium for the 43,345 Scandinavian fans who fancied taking in one of those rivalries that make the Premier League so compelling.",
      "There were Leeds debuts for Jaka Bijol and Lukas Nmecha, with fellow new-boys Sean Longstaff, Gabriel Gudmundsson and Sebastian Bornauw following suit in the second half after starting on the bench.",
      "Leeds will strengthen further this week when German midfielder Anton Stach arrives from Hoffenheim for £17million. Farke also rang the changes after the break, with Hollywood funnyman Will Ferrell, a minority investor at Elland Road, travelling to Sweden to offer his support from the posh seats.",
      "Ferrell might have had reason to smile in the second half as Leeds carved out decent chances for Jayden Bogle and substitute Largie Ramazani. Both times, keeper Tom Heaton came to United’s rescue with saves that illustrated why he has signed a one-year contract extension at the grand old age of 39.",
      "Amorim made 11 changes at half-time and was forced into another 18 minutes from time when Harry Maguire limped off with a knock. United should have won the contest two minutes from time, but Robbie Mainoo headed against the crossbar and Ayden Heaven fired his follow-up straight at Leeds keeper Illan Meslier from point-blank range.",

      "Although Amorim acknowledges the unwillingness of those in charge at United to repeat the mistakes of the past that led the club towards a financial abyss, the Portuguese head coach knows he needs new signings in place now if he is to have any chance of resurrecting the fallen giants from their lowest point for half a century.",

      "Amorim has banned Sancho, Marcus Rashford, Alejandro Garnacho, Antony and Tyrrell Malacia from attending the training ground at the same time as the first team. They are currently forced to arrive after 5pm, when everyone else has already gone home, in order to keep fit.",
      "The ‘bomb squad’ approach has proven contentious at United – but it is about to bear fruit with Sancho, with a transfer to Juventus a matter of days away. The winger had appeared set to join Chelsea at the end of the season after spending the campaign on loan with the Blues.",
      "However, Chelsea turned down the opportunity to sign him permanently, deciding they would rather stump up a £5million fee than pay £25m for his services. Sancho then agreed personal terms with Fenerbahce over a transfer, only for that move to collapse.",
      "Thankfully for United, Juve have stepped into the breach and Italian outlet Sportmediaset report that there is now a ‘full agreement’ with Sancho over a four-year contract worth €6m (£5.2m) per year. The Italian giants are close to agreeing terms with United too.",
      "Juve initially offered £15m (€17m), but are now ready to meet United’s asking price of €25m (£21.6m) – a figure which includes easily achievable add-ons and severance pay for Sancho, who is halving his salary to move to Turin.",
      "Sancho is currently paid around £300,000 per week by United, where he is under contract until June 2026. Fenerbahce had been willing to pay him €10m (£8.5m) per year, but that move to Jose Mourinho’s side fell apart.",
      "Juve are reportedly confident they can complete the deal before Thursday after Sancho’s agent spent time in Turin this week to agree terms. The transfer will bring to an end the 25-year-old’s miserable spell at United, who paid £73m to sign him from Borussia Dortmund in 2021.",
      "The winger has just 12 goals and six assists in 83 games for United, but still has a good reputation elsewhere. He registered five goals and 10 assists in 42 appearances across all competitions for Chelsea last season, helping them win the Conference League, and was impressive at Dortmund before that.",

      "Ruben Amorim handed a debut to the club's marquee summer signing, Matheus Cunha, in a strong first half team and the Brazilian attacker was by far the brightest spark in a relatively dour opening 45 minutes, where he linked neatly with United's other new boy, Diego Leon, on the left-hand side.",
      "Neither team could find a breakthrough and both rang the changes at half-time with United fielding a completely new XI for the second period.",
      "It was Leeds who came closest to the opener after the break with Tom Heaton making two good saves to keep the Premier League new boys at bay with Amine Ramazani spurning a golden chance to score.",
      "United and Leeds traded blows in the second half but, as the game petered out, honours stayed even amid a flurry of late substitutes from both sides.",
      "Cunha is one of the club's two summer signings to date and he was by far the brightest spark in a dire first half showing from both teams.",
      "The former Wolves man was dynamic and was one of the few players threatening to make things happen in the final third. He started proceedings as the left-sided No 10 in Amorim's preferred system and immediately looks right at home.",
      "Amad was one of the few shining lights in a difficult campaign for Manchester United and he looked bright again in Stockholm.",
      "But where does he fit best in United's current shape? He started here as the right wing-back but swapped positions with Toby Collyer to take up the right-sided No 10 spot. The uber-talented star has the attributes to thrive further up the pitch but it will be intriguing to see where he plays with Bryan Mbeumo incoming.",
      "Amorim's wing-backs are as good as wingers at time given how high they are up the pitch. Amad has caught the eye in an attacking role in the past, though. Whatever the manager's decision, one thing is for sure: Amad should surely be on of the first names on Amorim's teamsheet this coming season.",
      "United's game at the Strawberry Arena gave fans an early glimpse of their new wing-back, just 18. And Leon showed why he is now set to stay and compete for a place in Amorim's team instead of Harry Amass, who is poised to head out on loan.",
      "He looked comfortable high up and pitch and crafted one chance for Chido Obi in a lacklustre first half with a neat no-look pass. Leon has obviously been signed with the future in mind, but as far as first impressions go, this was positive.",
      "Yes, this point isn't exactly hot off the press, but Manchester United really need to kick into action in the transfer market.",
      "Their first half performance was reminiscent of plenty of United's games last season bar a brief flurry of penalty box action late in the half. If Amorim is to succeed, then he needs to be backed with signings.",
      "Cunha and Leon looked bright and Mbeumo was one of the Premier League's top attackers last season. He and Cunha in particular will help United no end, but they need much more if they are to have a successful season. Yes, funds are tight so that means player sales are needed. But United need to get moving on that front if they are to give Amorim the tools he requires to rebuild this team properly. Over to you, then, Ineos.",
      "Listen, it's the first game of pre-season: and it's certainly not all doom and gloom for Manchester United.",
      "The likes of Amad, Leon, Ayden Heaven, Leny Yoro, Kobbie Mainoo and Bendito Mantito to name just a few are evidence that the future is bright for United, even if things aren't all rosy at the moment. United just need the right signings to help balance things out and push them back among the Premier League's elite."

      "The United academy graduate, 27, is surplus to requirements at Old Trafford and spent the second half of the 2024-25 campaign on loan at Aston Villa after falling out with Ruben Amorim. The talented forward was always likely to move again this summer and it's no secret that Barcelona has long been Rashford's preferred destination.",
      "And after weeks of speculation, it seems as though Rashford - part of Amorim's five-man 'bomb squad' at United's Carrington training ground - will finally get his wish.",
      "Talks over an initial loan move between the clubs have begun, with the outline of an agreement reached - although the finer details still need to be sorted. Rashford's signing has already been approved by the Barca boss, Hansi Flick, after talks with the England international.",
      "Rashford would initially head to the Nou Camp on loan with an option included for the arrangement to be made permanent at a later date.",
      "Although United would prefer to offload Rashford permanently, a loan move will still benefit them in their bid to raise funds for further incoming transfers and they have agreed to the terms of the proposed deal, with talks now in the final stages.",
      "Rashford is one of the club's highest earner on £325,000-a-week; Villa paid two-thirds of that package plus bonuses when they signed him on loan back in January.",
      "The deal will also benefit Barcelona, whose financial difficulties in recent years have been well documented.",
      "The Spanish giants have been seeking a new left winger all summer and had agreed personal terms with Nico Williams over a transfer before the Athletic Club star had a late change of heart and opted to stay put.",
      "Barca have also pursued Luis Diaz but Liverpool insist the Colombia star is not for sale.",
      "When he was asked about signing a new winger this summer back in May, Flick said: “This is what we have talked about with the club. In the last matches maybe we did not have a lot of options in that position… so we have to bring more options to the team and more quality. This is the job from Deco, is clear, and I will support him.”",
      "When he was asked about interest in Rashford and Diaz specifically, Flick added: “I don’t want to speak about players which are not in my team, but of course Luis Diaz and Marcus Rashford are fantastic players. I like them and we’ll see what happens.”"

The fivesome are able to use the club's Carrington training ground, but have been asked to do so when the first-team and head coach Amorim have headed home.",

The 36-year-old has been tipped to sign for Serbian giants Crvena Zvezda, formerly known as Red Star Belgrade, after initially holding talks over a return to his home city with Rapid Vienna."

      "Hugill was also on target in United's final friendly before the tour last year against Rangers at Murrayfield. After an unfulfilling loan at League One side Wigan Athletic was cut short, he ended the season on the Carlisle bench as they were relegated to the National League. Hugill is now at League Two Barnet and his last 12 months could make for a power point presentation to keep every United youngster grounded.",
      "United, true to form, did not score against Leeds. No new striker and no goal. No surprise. That is how pre-season ended last year against Liverpool, with a 3-0 loss. A month later, Liverpool inflicted the same scoreline on United again and that one did matter.",
      "Tom Heaton, on for the second half, was United's best player, saving well from Largie Ramazani and Jayden Bogle. Even at the age of 39, Heaton is a more secure option in goal than the jittery Altay Bayindir in Andre Onana's absence.",
      "Unlike Hugill, Chido Obi missed the target when he had the temerity to shoot whilst off balance with Matheus Cunha running onto the ball. Cunha immediately rebuked Obi, who sheepishly offered a low five.",
      "Bruno Fernandes was quick to impose himself on his United debut, practically ordering players about when they had been his teammates for barely 48 hours. Cunha has a similar on-pitch personality.",
      "Last season's flashpoints against Ipswich Town and Bournemouth are evidence that Cunha is no shrinking violet. He has an edge that opponents will attempt to exploit but teammates can also expect to cop grief if they err.",
      "Cunha's exchange with Obi was not a case of bad body language. It was a senior player informing a junior player of the error of his ways. Obi can get a pass in a friendly but woe betide him if he repeats that in a meaningful match.",
      "There were a couple of fouls on Cunha, which he should take as a compliment. The odd physical duel injected a fragment of competitiveness into a mundane game.",
      "Players can be in lose-lose positions with friendlies. Good performances come with the caveat that they do not really matter. Bad performances invite more criticism.",
      "Certain individuals needed a performance. Not for the first time, Rasmus Hojlund vented at Diogo Dalot over his end product. \"F**k's sake,\" Hojlund yelled after Dalot's delayed pass.",
      "Hojlund's concern was that he may have strayed offside before he ran onto the through ball. On this evidence, the Dane's body language has not improved from last season.",
      "Dalot was apologetic when he failed to pass to Hojlund in San Sebastian in March but on this occasion ran on and blanked out the rollocking. With it so well-documented that United want a new striker, Hojlund cannot command much faith or confidence from teammates when they are warming up to service a new No.9.",
      "Twenty-two minutes later, Dalot crossed satisfactorily for Hojlund, who gave a thumbs up. His blocked header resulted in a goal kick. In added time, Hojlund was on Dalot's case again when he passed to Patrick Dorgu rather than him.",
      "There was a goalmouth scramble in the dying embers when Kobbie Mainoo hit the bar from three yards out and Ayden Heaven's prod on the follow-up was blocked. Hojliund should have been where Mainoo was, yet was the one heading the ball back across goal.",
      "Ruben Amorim operated identically to Erik ten Hag with the opening pre-season friendlies, fielding two entirely different XIs in each half. This one was reminiscent of the unwatchable post-season tour match in Kuala Lumpur that United lost. They were booed off that night, so avoided that at least.",
      "United showed more intent with their second XI in the second half. Dorgu was more attack-minded and drew a save while Mason Mount offered some incision.",

      "\"We have a lack of pace, especially in the middle of the park, and you can feel that's hard to bring the ball. But we create chances, I think Matheus Cunha showed what we need, that he's the player when he receives the ball between the lines, he can be really aggressive in the direction of the opponent.",
      "\"We have a lot to do but it was the first test against a Premier League team with two different teams, so it was a big test.",
      "\"We watched [Cunha] during last season in a different team, so we expect the same thing. You can see the connection between him and Bruno (Fernandes) is still not there but it's going to be a good connection because you can put a player like Kobbie (Mainoo) there, Mason Mount there. We have to increase our quality in the final third.",
      "\"We have to understand that the kid (Leon) came from Paraguay and it's his second week in Manchester United. He did really well, he's learning things, he's powerful. He's going to be a very good player.\"",
      "United fly to Chicago on Tuesday for their three-game pre-season tour in the Premier League Summer Series. After the club's worst campaign in 51 years, Amorim is desperate to cultivate a harmonious environment as United prepare for their first fixture of the forthcoming season against Arsenal in four weeks.",
      "\"I felt the environment is really good,\" he added. \"Sometimes we are going to struggle but we struggle together, and that is the beginning of everything. And then we have to put the quality, this club is not just about the effort, you have to have the quality you have to win games.",
      "\"We need to create that bond between everybody, not just them but the staff. All the changes are stopping, so we need to leave that as a group, we have a lot to improve, the speed of the game, all of the details. And we are going to improve.\""

      "Bryan Mbeumo finally looks to be on his way to Old Trafford after Brentford accepted United's latest bid with his medical expected to take place this weekend.",
      "With that deal close to being finalised, focus can shift elsewhere and it looks as though another attacking signing will be targeted. A number of top clubs are looking at strikers and that has left Ruben Amorim and Co. with limited options as Viktor Gyokeres looks to be joining Arsenal while Liverpool are in advanced discussions for Hugo Ekitike.",
      "However, Benjamin Sesko is still available and the RB Leipzig striker is certainly being considered by those at United. Chelsea's Nicolas Jackson is another option but their asking price could make any deal hard to complete.",

It’s one of the best leagues that exists. You dream about it. These are childhood dreams. But I’m not searching for the perfect club or the best club in the world.

      "It is claimed there is an agreement billed as an 'anti-Italy' clause which prevents Galatasaray from selling their star striker to another Italian team until 2027.

      "United beat FCSB 2-0 in their final Europa League league phase match that evening and Collyer had been withdrawn by the time goals from Diogo Dalot and Kobbie Mainoo steered the Reds safely through to the last-16.",
      "He was deployed alongside Bruno Fernandes in midfield in Bucharest, with Christian Eriksen and Mainoo preferred in the two No.10 positions.",
      "When the teamsheet dropped at the Strawberry Arena, it appeared as though Collyer was going to operate next to Casemiro in the centre of midfield, with Fernandes supporting new signing Matheus Cunha and Chido Obi in attack.",
      "However, it was Collyer who was deployed further forward. He occupied the right-sided No.10 spot and Fernandes joined Casemiro in the engine room.",
      "Pre-season is all about experimenting ahead of the competitive action so Ruben Amorim is entitled to test the water in matches where the outcome means very little.",
      "However, the United head coach's decision to deploy Collyer further forward was perhaps his way of trying to help Fernandes. Following the addition of Cunha, the feeling throughout the summer has been that the United captain will start the 2025/26 campaign in midfield.",
      "Fernandes regularly dropped deep in the second half of last season and was arguably more effective. He enjoyed a real purple patch in March when he was stationed as one of the two No.8s.",
      "With Bryan Mbeumo closing in on a move to Old Trafford, he is set to battle it out with Amad to land the right-sided No.10 spot. It is unlikely Amorim considers that position as Collyer's long-term habitat.",
      "Widely considered as a midfielder that tends to sit deep and try and marshal proceedings, it would be a drastic shift if he was to suddenly be transformed into a playmaker.",
      "With four more friendlies still to come, Amorim has plenty of time to experiment. However, the closer United get to the end of their pre-season schedule, the more likely it is the former Sporting Lisbon boss will field an XI that resembles something close to the one he has in mind for the season opener against Arsenal.",
      "United's starting XI in Stockholm had a rotational feel to it. An as interesting as Amorim's decision to start Collyer in such an advanced role was, it is likely he did it to try and get another look at Fernandes as a No.8.",
      "Having previously admitting he could see himself dropping deeper as his career progresses, Fernandes might be about to make a permanent position change at Old Trafford.",

      "The half-time whistle goes at the Strawberry Arena and it remains goalless.",
      "Casemiro just hit the bar and placed his hands on his head. The Brazilian has been off the pace during the first half and is set to be replaced. Amorim sent 12 players to warm-up before the interval and you would expect wholesale changes.",
      "That was the best piece of play in the half by far and Chido Obi made the wrong call. That was set up for Cunha, who you'd have backed to hit the target at the very least. He was well within his rights to rebuke Obi, whose movement was good but decision-making was not so good.",
      "Casemiro takes aim from distance on his weaker left foot and the ball goes over the top of the bar to a chorus of jeers from the Leeds fans."

      "Amorim said he needed to see whether Cunha understood the position, but that he shouldn't need to think too much\". And the first sign of teething problems came just a few minutes into the match when Toby Collyer had to urge Cunha to take up a more advanced role.",
      "Collyer only broke into the first-team last season. He made his debut against Liverpool in September and lacks experience, but it's reassuring he possesses the confidence to instruct a senior teammate.",
      "Cunha was in communication with a teammate himself, telling new signing Diego Leon to keep his width. Leon was essentially hugging the left touchline when United tried to build-up.",
      "Leeds targeted Leon's side in the opening exchanges and the dynamic Wilfried Gnoto asked a few questions, but there was a lack of quality from both sides in important areas.",
      "So much so that Amorim dished out tactical instructions to Bruno Fernandes, Amad and Cunha during a drinks interval. The pace had been mundane and the manager clearly wanted a little bit more from the players.",
      "Casemiro looked off the pace and lazily fired a shot over the bar on the cusp of the break. The 33-year-old provided value in the Europa League last season but should not be starting for United in 2025/2026.",
      "Noussair Mazraoui looked in good physical condition, which helped him to be United's best player in the first half. Cunha was the most exciting player in the first 45 minutes, although there was no competition for that prize.",
      "Cunha did provide a glimpse into what he will bring to the table, though. He executed step-overs and won a foul. Then he was fouled again closer to Leeds' penalty area. He is certainly worth buying a ticket to watch and will provide entertainment this season, along with cutting edge in front of goal.",
      "The forward scored 17 goals in a struggling Wolves side and the prospect of Cunha playing alongside Bryan Mbeumo, who will join United on their tour of the USA next week, has generated a buzz.",
      "Opening pre-season friendlies can look similar to training drills and the players who started conducted a warm down on the pitch under the guidance of Emanuel Ferro when it was half-time.",
      "Amorim replaced the entire XI at the break and gave an opportunity to Bendito Mantato who has impressed in training. The 17-year-old was deployed in the right side No.10 position, but has the qualities to excel at wing-back. The youngster was previously a left-back before being moved to the right wing by coaches.",
      "Kobbie Mainoo was among those who came on for the second half and this season will be significant for the 20-year-old, who hasn't been able to nail down a regular starting place under Amorim.",
      "Mainoo's momentum was disrupted by small injuries last term and there are doubts about which position he suits best. He played in the pivot in Stockholm and perhaps Amorim will settle on an answer this summer.",
      "The academy graduate improved United and sprayed a handful of long-range passes, giving them an outlet from midfield, and Mainoo objectively looks more comfortable in those areas.",
      "Rasmus Hojlund, who also played the second half, looked buoyant when he received warm applause from the Scandinavian fans before kick-off. Hojlund took huge steps backward last season but looks set to stay for the new campaign. He appreciated the support in Sweden and will be hungry to bounce back.",
      "Tom Heaton made two brilliant saves to deny Leeds after the break. Heaton replaced Bayindir at the interval and should replace him as second-choice goalkeeper.",
      "Rosenborg defeated United 1-0 in Norway for the opening pre-season friendly of last summer, and it's always impossible to gauge too much from the first friendly of pre-season. Some will joke the goalless draw against Leeds represents progress after the Rosenborg starter 12 months ago.",
      "United will now fly back to Manchester and prepare for the USA tour. They travel to the States on Tuesday and will be primarily based in Chicago for the three-game schedule.",
      "Amorim will hope his players are no longer rusty by then."

      "It is reported that Spanish giants Barcelona are working on a move for the 27-year-old with the player keen on a move to the Nou Camp. Barca are keen on signing a wide player this summer with a deal for Nico Williams falling through after he opted to stay with Athletic Club.",
      "It means that Barcelona have now turned their attention back to Rashford, with progress seemingly being made on a deal. Here is the latest on the player’s future and a potential move to Spain.",
      "In the latest big update, the Athletic report that Barcelona are now ‘advancing’ in a move to sign Rashford this summer, having made an offer to United. The offer will see the forward sign for the club on loan for the season with the agreement having an option to buy included.",
      "The report says that United are open to that idea, although it is not yet a done deal, talks are said to be at the final stages.",
      "Barcelona are a club who have been liked with an interest for some time. The loan deal will see Barcelona negotiate their financial situation.",
      "Rashford has sounded out Spanish intermediaries to try and engineer a move to the Catalan side",
      "The update comes after Rashford has not been involved in training with the squad for pre-season. He instead is on an individual training programme.",

      "Rashford spent the second half of last season on loan with Aston Villa, and the Athletic now give more information on the wage contribution involved in that deal. It’s reported that he is on more than £325,000 per-week, with Villa covering 75 percent as well as performance-related bonuses during the loan deal, with United covering the other 25 percent",
      "Villa did have the option of making the move permanent for a £40 million fee this summer, but they decided not to take up that option.",
      "Speaking about the possibility of signing a new wide man back in May, Flick said: This is what we have talked about with the club. In the last matches maybe we did not have a lot of options in that position… so we have to bring more options to the team and more quality. This is the job from Deco, is clear, and I will support him.”",
      "When asked about Luis Diaz and Rashford specifically, he added: “I don’t want to speak about players which are not in my team, but of course Luis Diaz and Marcus Rashford are fantastic players. I like them and we’ll see what happens.”",

      "Manchester United are confident of wrapping up the signing of attacker Bryan Mbeumo after submitting a third bid for the Brentford star.",
      "United have submitted a third bid for the Cameroonian international, understood to be worth up to £70million. They have offered £65m up front and an additional £5m in add-ons.",
      "United have been locked in talks with Brentford for just over six weeks, meaning they will now be hoping it will be third time lucky in their quest to lure him to Old Trafford. Mbeumo made it crystal clear several weeks ago that he wants to move to M16.",
      "After scoring 20 Premier League goals last season, Mbeumo would be a second statement signing of the summer for United. They have already splashed out £62.5m on bringing Matheus Cunha, who scored 17 goals last term, to the club from Wolves.",
      "Cunha is expected to occupy the left-sided No.10 position in head coach Ruben Amorim's 3-4-2-1 formation and there is a strong chance Mbeumo could be installed as the right-sided playmaker. His versatility, though, means he could be deployed elsewhere.",
      "Primarily a winger throughout his time at Brentford, Mbeumo is renowned for cutting in from the right and making full use of his trustworthy left foot. It means he could be an option as either the right-sided No.10 or right wing-back for Amorim.",
      "Amad, who regularly blossomed for United last term, is also equally capable as a right-sided No.10 or right wing-back. With that said, the worst that can happen is that Amad and Mbeumo create healthy competition for each other and a selection dilemma for Amorim.",
      "With Cunha a guaranteed starter and Mbeumo expected to be given the same treatment if he finalises a switch to M16 without any further setbacks, Amorim's first-choice starting XI for the 2025/26 will be closer towards completion.",
      "As things currently stand, United are still in the market for a striker, a midfielder and a goalkeeper, meaning they will soon have to flex their muscles in the seller's market to fund those prospective additions.",
      "Despite currently being unavailable because of a hamstring injury, Andre Onana is expected to remain United's first-choice goalkeeper this season. United want to recruit a shot-stopper who can compete with and push the Cameroonian, but Onana is under the impression he will remain Amorim's No.1.",
      "United are well-stocked at centre-back and pre-season performances could dictate who starts the season opener against Arsenal in a month's time. Leny Yoro and Ayden Heaven are the future of United's backline and will believe they are worthy of becoming staples in the wide centre-back roles, while Matthijs de Ligt and Harry Maguire will be fighting to start in the middle.",
      "On the presumption Mbeumo is deployed in attack, Amad is the logical pick at right wing-back after regularly catching the eye on the right flank last season. Meanwhile, Patrick Dorgu is a shoo-in on the opposite flank and will be keen to improve after arriving from Lecce earlier this year.",
      "Following Cunha's arrival, Bruno Fernandes is expected to complete a permanent switch to midfield and occupy one of the two No.8 spots. He regularly operated from the engine room in the second half of last term and rarely looked out of place.",
      "Manuel Ugarte, Kobbie Mainoo, Toby Collyer and Casemiro are all currently jockeying to join Fernandes in midfield, but the club remains keen on signing a new midfielder. Who that could be is currently impossible to predict.",
      "Mbeumo and Cunha will build two thirds of Amorim's attack, occupying the two No.10 spots. The United chief struggled in his search for consistency in those two roles last season, meaning it is highly likely those positions could be occupied by new faces.",
      "United's need for an out-and-out centre-forward has been well-documented throughout the summer, and they attempted to solve that particular mission quickly by swooping for Liam Delap last month. However, Chelsea pipped them to his signature.",
      "The Reds have since been heavily linked with the likes of Viktor Gyokeres and Victor Osimhen but are increasingly likely to miss out on both of them. Fortunately, the prospect of adding Mbeumo to the addition of Cunha should ease the attacking burden on whoever leads United's attack come the start of the season.",
      "United's dream XI: Onana; Yoro, De Ligt, Heaven; Amad, new midfielder, Fernandes, Dorgu; Mbeumo, Cunha; new striker.",

      "What MEN Sport says: Moving to Bayer Leverkusen would be a brilliant move for not just Antony but United too. Currently, the winger's heart is set on returning to Real Betis, which is fine, but they do not seem capable of paying the sort of figure that United are demanding. If Leverkusen were to enter the race, there is a likelihood that they would be able to match United's asking price. The Reds cannot afford to allow every player to go on the cheap just to get them off the books so there would definitely be a few in the recruitment team hoping the Bundesliga club change their mind.",
      "According to GiveMeSport, RB Leipzig striker Benjamin Sesko would be interested in signing for United should they come in for him this summer. The Slovenian entered talks with Arsenal earlier in the window but it now seems the Gunners' priorities are elsewhere.",
      "As for Sesko, who is valued at £78m, he is reportedly willing to give United priority even though they cannot offer him Champions League football.",
      "What MEN Sport says: It is clear that Ruben Amorim would prefer to sign Viktor Gyokeres in an ideal world this summer. However, that ship looks to have sailed and the attention must now switch to other targets. Sesko would be an impressive second choice. He has a very similar profile to Gyokeres - he is quick, strong and has an eye for goal. What potentially makes him an even better option than the Swede is his age. He is five years younger than Gyokeres which makes him a more enticing prospect for Ineos who favour signings with potential resale value. It will be interesting to see if this progresses further."

      "Amid the uncertainty, Milan are reported to be looking to capitalise on Guerra's contract situation by expressing an interest in his signature. Valencia and Milan are not yet in talks over a deal for Guerra, the report claims, but the Serie A giants are apparently already looking to present a contract offer to the midfielder in an effort to tempt him into a move to the San Siro.",

      "This summer has confirmed the existence of the Premier League tax beyond all doubt, with one Arsenal transfer unsurprisingly taking the expensive biscuit.",
      "While no deal completed this summer can challenge the biggest overpays in Premier League history, plenty have already been made well in excess of a player’s reported market value.",
      "A few factors go into that assessment. Age, performance level and experience are inevitably taken into account but the number of interested teams, general market trends and the reputation and status of the leagues the selling and buying clubs belong to can also heavily dictate that that market value.",
      "And when it comes to those increasingly expensive intra-Premier League transfers there is basically a £10m surcharge applied before talks even commence.",
      "It is no coincidence that five of the seven biggest supposed overpays – going by the numbers crunched by the fine folk at Transfermarkt – involve a pair of Premier League clubs both trying to orchestrate PSR-friendly deals.",
      "Nor that Real Madrid account for the other two when they signed Alvaro Carreras and Franco Mastantuono.",
      "But those five Premier League overpays, made by four of the Big Six plus Newcastle, do beg the question as to who has been most royally screwed.",
      "",
      "Noni Madueke (Chelsea to Arsenal)",
      "Fee: £52m\nTransfermarkt valuation at the time: £34.7m",
      "If you listen to Arsenal supporters, which is medically inadvisable at the best of times, the Madueke signing is not only an egregious use of club funds but an act so deeply objectionable as to prompt petitions, protests and defaced murals.",
      "That the line for those deeply ‘entitled’ fans is drawn at their favourite football club making what they deem to be an underwhelming signing, rather than the shameful handling of the Thomas Partey debacle, is a cripplingly damning indictment on the modern world.",
      "But there is a sense that better value than Madueke was out there if Arsenal dared to look beyond Stamford Bridge.",
      "The case for the defence would be that a 23-year-old England international already settled in London and familiar with the Premier League, who can play in and cover more than one position in a shallow attack, is worth stretching the budget for to mitigate any concerns over a player from a different country needing time to acclimatise.",
      "Madueke offering a different skillset to break down those low blocks could also be crucial for an Arsenal side which has proven decidedly one-dimensional and unimaginative at times in their last three years of sustained Premier League title challenges.",
      "The wider outlook would likely have been completely different had Madueke arrived after the long-awaited Proper Striker was captured but as long as a deal for Viktor Gyokeres is finally pushed over the line this summer and a Chelsea cast-off does not represent Arsenal’s biggest attacking addition, those fan frustrations should soon be drowned out.",
      "",
      "Anthony Elanga (Nottingham Forest to Newcastle)",
      "Fee: £52m\nTransfermarkt valuation at the time: £36.4m",
      "Is Anthony Elanga worth £55m? Perhaps only to Newcastle but when the Magpies have understandably identified him as an ideal fit in their counter-attacking system then it hardly matters.",
      "Newcastle had bids of £35m and £50m rejected for Elanga in summer 2024. After a season in which his six goals and 11 assists were crucial in helping secure European qualification for Nottingham Forest, a slight increase for their priority target was palatable.",
      "And if Eddie Howe succeeds in protecting Alexander Isak from the clutches of Liverpool, he has a pair of international teammates who have already established a connection he can coach and nurture.",
      "It is, for the first time since Sandro Tonali two years prior, a signing which represents an immediate first-team upgrade at St James’ Park.",
      "As the most recent scorer of a Champions League knockout stage goal for Manchester United, Elanga even brings a degree of experience to a stage Newcastle are still adjusting to.",
      "",
      "Mohammed Kudus (West Ham to Spurs)",
      "Fee: £55m\nTransfermarkt valuation at the time: £39m",
      "There is always a quirk in the system and the idea Spurs overpaid for Kudus seems curious.",
      "The deal was struck for £30m less than his release clause with a bitter rival, who had three years left on the contract of arguably their most gifted player.",
      "But coming off the back of a season in which Kudus scored five goals, assisted three and suffered a stunning headloss against Spurs themselves resulting in a considerable ban, it could be argued that the Europa League winners paid a little over the odds.",
      "Thomas Frank pinpointed Kudus as his main transfer target because of the “unpredictability” the Ghanaian can provide in attack at “almost the perfect age to perform and hit the next level”.",
      "While moving a player with those characteristics across enemy lines was always going to require some intricate negotiations, Spurs pushed it through at a price both parties could sell as a win.",
      "",
      "Joao Pedro (Brighton to Chelsea)",
      "Fee: £55m\nTransfermarkt valuation at the time: £43.3m",
      "From the competition Chelsea faced for Pedro to the remuneration Brighton were due for their work in developing a former club-record £30m signing, the Brazilian was always going to cost a pretty penny.",
      "Throw into the equation the fees Chelsea consistently pay for forwards in particular – and what is effectively the antithesis of a discount at their favourite shop as Brighton are still making them pay for the Moises Caicedo mess – and it could be suggested that the Blues paid over the odds.",
      "But rarely if ever before has a player paid back their fee so quickly and specifically as with Pedro, whose first three Chelsea goals helped win the Club World Cup and earn Enzo Maresca’s side an extra £30m or so.",
      "",
      "Matheus Cunha (Wolves to Manchester United)",
      "Fee: £62.5m\nTransfermarkt valuation at the time: £52m",
      "The spotlight which comes with a move to Manchester United cannot have surprised Cunha but being scapegoated by Newcastle for their lack of signings and blamed by Sporting for their valuation of Viktor Gyokeres seemed curious.",
      "It is unknown precisely how far Manchester United would have gone in the bidding if Cunha wasn’t accompanied by a release clause which specified his price tag – or indeed if they would have targeted him at all without one.",
      "A multi-functional 26-year-old Brazilian international forward with 42 goal contributions in 82 Premier League appearances does, after all, come with a premium.",
      "And if all else fails, Manchester United will simply continue Cunha’s career trend of being sold for £18m profit every two years.",
      "This summer has confirmed the existence of the Premier League tax beyond all doubt, with one Arsenal transfer unsurprisingly taking the expensive biscuit.",
      "A former Arsenal player has backed Noni Madueke to become a starter, while criticising fan reaction and comparing him to Kai Havertz.",
      "According to reports, two key reasons are behind Mikel Arteta’s decision to “really push” Arsenal to sign Noni Madueke from Chelsea for around £52m.",
      "An ex-Arsenal player has questioned Arsenal’s move for Noni Madueke and hints it could signal a deeper issue involving Bukayo Saka’s future.",
      "Leandro Trossard has indicated to Arsenal that he wants to leave this summer after the club’s transfer flurry in recent days, according to reports.",
      "According to reports, Premier League giants Arsenal will complete their next summer signing ‘today’ as they close in on four deals."

      "Marcus Rashford should be the most sellable member of the five-man Manchester United bomb squad. But he’s not…",
      "When they entered the summer, United were apparently hopeful of raking in around £160million for the five players everyone knows they want rid of.",
      "That, obviously, was ludicrous. The only club daft enough to pay top whack for these lads would be United themselves.",
      "So as the summer rolls on, United remain at an impasse with the transfers, unable to strengthen much further before they get rid of their drifters.",
      "How much can they hope to bank now? Is it possible they will start the season with all five still on their books? Here’s how we rank the unwanted stars based on how likely they are to earn some money for United…",
      "",
      "5) Tyrell Malacia\nPSV opted against taking up their option to sign Malacia for £9million because they’re not daft. The Netherlands defender started only three Eredivisie games after joining in January but at least he proved to any potential suitors that he’s not completely broken having spent over a year on the sidelines.",
      "Ruben Amorim didn’t aid United in their mission to sell Malacia when he revealed the 25-year-old hasn’t got it in him to play as a wing-back because he struggles to go forward. Which feels like something United ought to have spotted earlier but, as we know, they haven’t been the most observant bunch.",
      "So what now? United will apparently accept something like £3million just so Malacia doesn’t show as a loss on the books. Will anyone who can afford his £75,000-a-week salary stump up? Probably not.",
      "",
      "4) Jadon Sancho \nUnited need to hope there is some truth in reports Juventus want both Sancho and Francisco Conceicao since it seems the Old Lady has done a deal to sign the Portuguese winger from Porto.",
      "Regardless, whether it’s Juve or anyone else, United will have to accept they aren’t going to get anything like the £25million they hoped for. Frankly, they’ll be fortunate to bank anything while escorting Sancho off the premises one last time.",
      "The winger is on something ridiculous like £250,000 a week which he is due for another year. Chelsea offered him the chance to get away for less, but that wasn’t for him. Juve certainly won’t pay the same salary – reports suggest he’s being offered half. And we doubt Sancho is motivated enough to give up half of what he’s contractually owed to take up a great opportunity in Turin.",
      "And, to be fair, why should he? It makes sense for Sancho to sit tight, wait for a loan move at the end of the window, when United will have to accept paying only a portion of his salary for the reward of having him out the door. Then, in a year, after another season trousering an undeserved wedge, he gets to go as a free agent.",
      "So, if anyone is daft enough to offer actual money for Sancho, United ought to snap their hand off.",
      "",
      "3) Antony\nAside from Malacia, around whom all is deathly quiet, the least noise among the bomb squad is coming from Antony’s direction. Because it was thought Real Betis would find a way to bring back a winger who regained some credibility while on loan in Spain during the second half of last season.",
      "Can Betis afford to buy? Maybe, probably not. And they are cool with that being known. Because it will squeeze United ever more over a player who clearly has no future under Amorim.",
      "Of course, Betis would prefer Antony back on loan but United insist they won’t do that. At least not without guarantees and the Spaniards are toying with some workarounds. There are reports of interest from elsewhere but nothing firm enough for Betis to panic into making United an offer they might be satisfied to accept. Certainly not yet. And they are content in the knowledge Antony fancies being back in Andalusia.",
      "Apparently, United have already dropped the asking price from £40million to £30million, but they won’t get that either. Certainly not in the form of cold hard cash they can put towards their stalled summer recruitment.",
      "🔴⚪⚫ MORE MAN UTD FROM F365\n👉 Amorim sacked for Xavi as Postecoglou returns: Predicting nine Premier League successors\n👉 Only West Ham more miserable than Man Utd in Premier League mood rankings",
      "",
      "2) Marcus Rashford\nRashford is probably United’s most sellable asset of the five. But that also means he can afford to be pickier when choosing his next move.",
      "Ideally, he would go to Barcelona. A few weeks ago, that appeared something of a pipe dream while Nico Williams was being teased by the Catalans. But Barca’s failure to close a deal for Williams highlights the financial constraints they remain under.",
      "If they can’t buy Williams, they probably can’t buy Rashford. But they can wait until the back end of the window before offering a loan deal with options or obligations, which at least gets the forward’s salary – or most of it – off United’s books.",
      "Barca can bide their time here because they know Rashford’s desire. Without something coming from nothing, the only obvious threat we see here is Bayern Munich, given the Bavarians and Liverpool are way, way off in their valuations of Luis Diaz. And even then, Leandro Trossard could be a cheaper option.",
      "",
      "1) Alejandro Garnacho\nThe Argentina winger probably represents United’s best chance of banking some cash. But certainly not the £70million they initially hoped for. Nor £60million after their first reduction. If they get anything more than half the price they were initially quoting, that’s a result.",
      "Why should they be grateful for that? Because Garnacho would be a risk for anyone taking on the his full rights this summer.",
      "As a player, we know he is limited. He has bursts, moments. For a winger, he’s not rapid and as a right-footer on the left, he struggles to go down the outside.",
      "If that doesn’t make buyers beware, his character ought to. There were red flags around Garnacho’s attitude even before he made his first senior start and all the evidence suggests little has changed.",
      "So the smart suitors will insist on trying before they buy, but someone of the not-unreasonable belief that United is more the problem, not the player, could be tempted by Garnacho. Probably Chelsea.",
      "Marcus Rashford has reportedly sanctioned a gargantuan pay cut to facilitate his loan to Barcelona, who have a ‘verbal agreement’ with Manchester United.",
      "According to reports, FC Barcelona are ‘advancing’ to sign Manchester United outcast Marcus Rashford, with David Ornstein revealing two key details.",
      "According to reports, Manchester United could be saved by Premier League rivals Nottingham Forest as they are plotting a ‘sensational swoop’.",
      "Man Utd have reportedly reserved some money to buy Gabriel Sara from Galatasaray this summer, while there is an update on Marcus Rashford.",
      "Man Utd have agreed a £71m fee with Brentford for Bryan Mbeumo but once Sir Jim Ratcliffe remembers he ‘won’t be held ransom’ they will need to find an alternative.",
      "Man Utd boss Ruben Amorim has reportedly suggested that Barcelona could use one player if they wanted to reduce their asking price for Marcus Rashford."

      "10) Como – £87.9m\nThe richest club in Serie A are determined to spend money to secure European football for next season. Jesus Rodriguez is the most expensive of those to arrive so far.",
      "",
      "9) Bayer Leverkusen – £88m\nArmed with money from Liverpool for Florian Wirtz and Jeremie Frimpong, new coach Erik ten Hag has been busy, with US international Malik Tillman coming in for a club-record fee.",

      "",
      "8) Atletico Madrid – £92.6m\nAlex Baena, Johnny Cardoso, Thiago Almada and Matteo Ruggeri have all cost a pretty penny and are aged between 22 and 24 as Diego Simeone rebuilds again.",
      "",
      "7) Sunderland – £100.43m\nFive first-team signings have come in to no little cost. And the Black Cats are not finished.",
      "",
      "6) Tottenham – £120.52m\nSpent a decent whack of money spent on Kevin Danso, Mathys Tel, Luka Vuskovic and Kota Takai before Thomas Frank even got a say. Mohammed Kudus had shot Spurs up into the top three before they were overtaken again; Morgan Gibbs-White would get them closer to Liverpool.",
      "",
      "5) Manchester City – £122.1m\nThat’s the price of a Rayan Ait-Nouri from Wolves, a Rayan Cherki from Lyon, a Tijanji Reijnders from AC Milan and a Sverre Nypan from Rosenborg, and all of them feel like bargains.",
      "",
      "4) Arsenal – £127m\nThere is agitation at Arsenal that a nine-figure spend is yet to deliver a shiny new centre-forward but if Viktor Gyokeres does eventually arrive it is likely to be a £200m summer to spark the start of Mikel Arteta’s next phase.",
      "",
      "3) Real Madrid – £144.4m\nThey had already dropped £50m on Dean Huijsen and £8.5m on a few weeks of Trent Alexander-Arnold before they agreed to sign man-child Franco Mastantuono for an awful lot of money. And then came Alvaro Carreras for another £43m.",
      "",
      "2) Liverpool – £194.5m\nFlorian Wirtz has cost an initial £100m (yes, it could rise to £116m but we’re not worried about add-ons on this particular list) and Jeremie Frimpong has cost £29.5m. We have also added the £25m on Giorgi Mamardashvili as that transfer will be counted in this summer’s accounts. And now Milos Kerkez has joined for a cool £40m.",
      "",
      "1) Chelsea – £210.6m\nThey were the top spenders in the summers of 2024, 2023 and 2022 and will be up there in 2025 thanks to pre-arranged moves for Estevao, Dario Essugo, Mamadou Sarr and Kendry Paez. Throw in the £30m signing of Liam Delap and the Blues were already making very expensive waves before they signed Joao Pedro for an initial £55m and Jamie Gittens for not much less."

      "",
      "16) Romeo Lavia – £53m rising to £58m (Southampton to Chelsea, August 2023)\nThe numbers are a little shady but they paint a compelling picture: Lavia has missed more than three times as many Chelsea games through injury (67) as he has played for the Blues since joining (21).",

      "10) Riyad Mahrez – £60m (Leicester to Manchester City, July 2018)\nHad things gone to plan then Mahrez would have honoured only the first season of a four-year contract he signed with newly-crowned Premier League champions Leicester. The Algerian felt he had a gentleman’s agreement that would allow him to walk proudly out of the door in summer 2017 but the Foxes were unmoved.",

      "When Arsenal needed a Proper Striker it was decided by Mikel Arteta that a sort of centre-forward would do, even though he was signed as Granit Xhaka’s midfield successor at the time. A total of 42 combined goals and assists in 87 games is a fine record for a player whose strengths are ignored and shortcomings highlighted like few others.",
      "",
      "7) Wesley Fofana – £70m rising to £75m (Leicester to Chelsea, August 2022)\nThe final boss of the Lavia-Mount strand of player. Fofana has missed 105 club games through injury while contracted to Chelsea, for whom he has played 34 times.",
      "The Frenchman is still 19 Blues games from surpassing the number of appearances he made for Leicester. Thomas Tuchel was in charge when they signed him!",

      "There were precisely no winners from the sorry old mess. It is a great bit that former Chelsea and Manchester United striker Lukaku’s three best goalscoring Premier League seasons were with Everton and West Brom.",

      "4) Harry Maguire – £80m (Leicester to Manchester United, August 2019)\nAnother player Manchester City flirted with before, in Guardiola’s words, it was decided the club with a basically unlimited budget “could not afford it”, Maguire was Manchester United’s answer to the conundrum Liverpool posed with Van Dijk: what if teams actually spent considerable money on a centre-half?",
      "Maguire’s greatest asset since has been mental resilience. He was stripped of a captaincy awarded to him within half a year of joining and has been ostracised by two managers before both realised their mistake and brought him back into the fold.",

      "3) Jack Grealish – £100m (Aston Villa to Manchester City, August 2021)\nA player so good Aston Villa had to sign three before he left to replace him.",
      "Grealish was the free-running show pony in a modest stable, who will soon be turned to glue or lasagna after being consumed by the great Manchester City outdoors.",
      "",
      "2) Declan Rice – £100m rising to £105m (West Ham to Arsenal, July 2023)\nArsenal played an absolute blinder in laying the groundwork before keeping the bidding at a controlled level. Manchester City made one offer and promptly withdrew from the race upon its rejection, leaving the Gunners with a clear track.",

      "With so much transfer talk doing the rounds, we’re here through the summer to sift through the bullsh*t and highlight the whispers that might have some substance.",
      "Each day we’re ranking the top 20 rumours involving Premier League clubs, the higher the link, the more likely we feel they are to become done deals.",
      "So we start with the tittle-tattle…",
      "",
      "20) 🔽 Alexander Isak – Newcastle to Liverpool\nIt seems as though Liverpool have taken Newcastle seriously when they were told that Isak isn’t for sale. And the intent the Reds are showing around Ekitike instead douses our suspicion that Dicky Hughes wasn’t done with Isak.",
      "",
      "19) 🆕 Rasmus Hojlund – Manchester United to AC Milan\nMilan are looking into the feasibility of signing Hojlund as they search for a striker. United paid Atalanta £72million two years ago and the Rossoneri would struggle to give the Red Devils half of their money back. And even if Hojlund has struggled, from a numbers perspective, United simply cannot afford to shed any strikers since Hojlund is the only senior specialist centre-forward they currently have.",
      "",
      "18) 🆕 Marcus Rashford – Manchester United to Juventus\nSky in Italy reckon Juve have ‘begun to explore the conditions’ around a deal to sign Rashford. Which is presumably when they discover they can’t afford him without one or two parties making serious concessions. Like Barcelona, the Old Lady would have to wait until United get desperate and start considering loans.",
      "",
      "17) Jadon Sancho – Manchester United to Juventus\nIt seems Juve have finally agreed a deal with Porto for Francisco Conceicao which, presumably, will supress the Old Lady’s appetite for Sancho. And with the talk of Juve interest in Rashford, what now for Sancho?",
      "",
      "16) 🆕 Nicolas Jackson – Chelsea to Aston Villa\nJackson was rumoured to be of interest to Manchester United but Unai Emery is said to be keen to be reunited with the striker with whom he worked at Villarreal. Villa’s interest in Jackson is heavily linked to…",
      "",
      "15) 🆕 Morgan Rogers – Aston Villa to Chelsea\nRogers is said to be Chelsea priority for the remainder of the window and while Villa are reluctant to sell, any big offer would have to be considered. If Rogers is to join Chelsea, likely triggering a Villa move for Jackson, it won’t be long before the end of the window.",
      "",
      "14) Benjamin Sesko – RB Leipzig to Manchester United\nSesko is back in the 20 after losing out to Gyokeres in Arsenal audition but, apparently, United are ‘serious’ about signing the Slovenian. Maybe they are, and Christ knows they need a striker, but they will have to start selling sharpish if they are to afford what Leipzig are demanding.",

      "13) Marc Guehi – Crystal Palace to Liverpool\nWith a year left on his contract and a renewal unlikely, Palace are willing to cash in on their captain – but Liverpool won’t pay the £50million or so the Eagles are demanding. Currently, we are at stalemate. Liverpool don’t seem twitchy yet, but they are keeping the lines of communication open.",
      "",
      "12) 🔼 Alejandro Garnacho – Manchester United to Chelsea\nChelsea are selling one winger for £52million and reports suggest they could sign a replacement (do they really need one?) for £40million in the shape of Garnacho. The Blues were keen in January and, unbelievably, nothing between then and now has put them off the Argentinian, perhaps due to the discount on the hefty price they were quoted at the start of the year. Garnacho’s got to go somewhere.",
      "",
      "11) Eberechi Eze – Crystal Palace to Arsenal\nEze is keen on the prospect of moving to the Emirates and some reports suggest a deal is now down to the finer details of how the fee to activate his release clause is paid. Arsenal are a little tied up this week with Madueke and Gyokeres, but once those deals are done, we can expect some progress over Eze.",
      "",
      "10) Marcus Rashford – Manchester United to Barcelona\nWith Nico Williams signing a new contract with Athletic Bilbao and Liverpool ignoring interest in Luis Diaz, Rashford is said to have found himself at the top of Barca’s wish-list and the Catalans are ready to go ‘all in’. Unfortunately for Barca – and United – ‘all’ doesn’t amount to much these days. Rashford wants the move and, most likely, United will be paying him to play as a loanee at the Nou Camp next season.",
      "",
      "9) 🆕 Yoanne Wissa – Brentford to Newcastle\nNewcastle seem to have switched their sights from Ekitike to Wissa. But there could be more bad news for the Mags. Man Utd seem to have finally got their mitts on Bryan Mbeumo, which makes it less likely the Bees will entertain interest in Wissa too.",
      "",
      "8) 🔼 Luis Diaz – Liverpool to Bayern Munich\nBayern made their move for Diaz, who wants to make a move of his own. But Liverpool wouldn’t entertain the bid of £58.6million, with the Reds insisting they want to keep the Colombian, though £87million might twist their arm. There seems to be an openness from all sides to a deal, with Diaz keen to make it happen. Bayern will return with an improved offer but the player may have to do his bit too.",
      "",
      "7) Evan Ferguson – Brighton to Roma\nAfter a loan spell at West Ham in which he did absolutely nothing, Ferguson is now close to joining Roma on loan, with some claiming the Italians will retain the option to buy. Sounds like a great opportunity for a striker once rated at £100million to kickstart his stalling career, assuming the two clubs can find an agreement over a fee should the loan become a permanent arrangement. Lord knows they’ve been discussing it for long enough.",
      "",
      "",
      "5) 🔼 Cristhian Mosquera – Valencia to Arsenal\nArsenal had one bid rejected for the 2024 Golden Boy-shortlisted defender but they remain in talks with Valencia. Which didn’t appear to be going well, but Ornstein suggests the Gunners are getting there. And Mosquera’s farewell message suggests it is heading in the right direction.",
      "",
      "4) Hugo Ekitike – Eintracht Frankfurt to Liverpool\nNewcastle saw the writing on the wall and backed away quietly, leaving Liverpool to argue the toss with Eintracht. Their first offer worth £70million was rejected and, to be fair to the Germans, the suggestion has always been that they want £85million. And since Liverpool were prepared to go way above that for Isak, Eintracht will try to squeeze Liverpool for all they are worth, even if Ekitike is keen to move to Anfield.",
      "",
      "3) 🔼 Viktor Gyokeres – Sporting to Arsenal\nSo many claims and counter claims now, we had almost given up trying to keep up. But this seems to be reaching what felt like the inevitable conclusion. Gyokeres’ representatives were apparently in London at the start of the week, and removal vans have been seen shifting furniture from his home in Portugal. If Arteta wants the striker on the plane for the pre-season tour, this needs to progress significantly in the next 24 hours.",
      "",
      "2) 🔼 Bryan Mbeumo – Brentford to Manchester United\nWe have a deal! United have spent weeks haggling, only to pay more than Brentford’s initial asking price. But a medical is set to take place over the weekend before Mbeumo flies off to the United States with his new team-mates. Now for a striker. And some sales.",
      "",
      "1) 🔼 Noni Madueke – Chelsea to Arsenal\nThe Chelsea winger will be unveiled by Arsenal any time now after a £52million move. Which will prompt some screeching U-turns among the Arsenal fan base, you would expect."

      "As revealed by Cheeses Of Nazareth, a Twitter account focused on United ticket details, the club reached out to supporters to take part in discussions about proposals for the new stadium.",
      "Although attendance was reportedly low, the club did set out a number of discussion points.",
      "First up, there was the idea of a long-term season ticket contract which involves paying a large upfront fee to secure your seat for 15 years or more. Purchasing this would also secure your seat from being reallocated should the club decide that was needed.",
      "Another proposal was that 40% of the 100,000-seater stadium would be for hospitality, including ‘premium viewing areas’ on the halfway line.",
      "Speaking of premium, that was a suggestion for a new model of season ticket which would give fans better chances of securing away tickets, access to concerts at the ground and premium stadium areas.",
      "But perhaps the suggestion that would most go against a typical English view of football is the ‘American-style Matchday Experience.’ This would see the concourse extended to include 360-degree screen bars, multiple smaller merchandise outlets instead of a single large megastore and the ability to move around the concourse with your ticket.",
      "This idea is not unique to United with clubs like Tottenham already having such a system in place.",
      "At the time of the stadium’s announcement, co-owner Jim Ratcliffe said he wanted it to be not just the “the world’s greatest football stadium” but also “the catalyst for social and economic renewal of the Old Trafford area.”",
      "“Today marks the start of an incredibly exciting journey to the delivery of what will be the world’s greatest football stadium, at the centre of a regenerated Old Trafford,” Ratcliffe said.",
      "“Our current stadium has served us brilliantly for the past 115 years, but it has fallen behind the best arenas in world sport. By building next to the existing site, we will be able to preserve the essence of Old Trafford, while creating a truly state-of-the-art stadium that transforms the fan experience, only footsteps from our historic home.",
      "“Just as important is the opportunity for a new stadium to be the catalyst for social and economic renewal of the Old Trafford area, creating jobs and investment, not just during the construction phase, but on a lasting basis when the stadium district is complete.",

      "The report written by Laurie Whitwell claims: ‘Rashford, Alejandro Garnacho, Antony, Jadon Sancho and Tyrell Malacia being told they must train separately from Amorim’s group and only arrive at Carrington at 5pm, after the first-team have left, is part of a club strategy to make clear to each player they have no future at United and encourage them to actively search for and accept a transfer.",
      "‘Not everybody at United agrees with the decision to limit their access to evening hours, however, given the relationships they have with people at the club. There is also the fear that ostracising them lowers their value in the transfer market, an awkward look at a time when ordinary workers are being laid off to cut costs.’",

      "Chelsea and Arsenal are responsible for five of the 20 most expensive goalkeeper signings in history, with Liverpool sitting pretty.",
      "",
      "1) Kepa Arrizabalaga – £71.6m/€80m (Athletic Bilbao to Chelsea, August 2018)\nDespite never coming close to convincing at Stamford Bridge, the world’s most expensive keeper has racked up over 100 Premier League appearances and more clean sheets than Antti Niemi, who is actually 53. His best season as a Chelsea player was on loan at Bournemouth, mind. And now Arsenal might sign him for £5m.",
      "",
      "2) Alisson – £67m/€75m (Roma to Liverpool, July 2018)\n“Chelsea were changing their manager and not playing in the Champions League. I’ve also always admired Liverpool’s history. This is a club with five European Cups in their trophy cabinet. I really wanted to be part of that history,” said Alisson of his decision to join the Reds instead of the Blues in summer 2018. Having won it all at Anfield, it’s difficult to argue he chose wrong.",
      "",
      "3) Andre Onana – £43.9m/€51m (Inter to Man Utd, July 2023)\nTwelve months after joining Inter from Ajax as a free agent, Champions League finalist Onana reunited with Erik ten Hag as part of an Old Trafford revolution which has not quite gone to plan.",
      "",
      "4) Thibaut Courtois – £35m/€38.8m (Chelsea to Real Madrid, August 2018)\nThe desire of Courtois to leave Chelsea set in motion three of the four most expensive goalkeeper transfers in history. After starring in the 2018 World Cup, the Belgian forced a move to Real Madrid through and has 12 trophies to show for the subsequent seven years.",
      "",
      "5) Ederson – £34.7m/€40m (Benfica to Manchester City, June 2017)\nClaudio Bravo gave it a go but that went so well he lost his place mid-season to Willy Caballero, so Pep Guardiola went out and placed all his eggs in the basket of an uncapped 23-year-old with 74 top-flight career appearances. As it turns out: fair call.",
      "",
      "6) Gianluigi Buffon – £32.6m/€51.9m (Parma to Juventus, July 2001)\nFor almost 16 years, Buffon reigned as the world’s most expensive goalkeeper – and it took no little inflation and conversion nonsense to dethrone him. Juventus got their money’s worth in 22 trophies, a record number of Serie A clean sheets and a historic amount of Champions League bottling.",
      "",
      "7) Jasper Cillessen – £31.4m/€35m (Barcelona to Valencia, June 2019)\nValencia finished fourth in the two seasons before spending a small fortune on a 30-year-old keeper who played five La Liga games in three years with Barcelona; Los Che came 9th, 12th and 9th again before Cillessen left.",
      "",
      "8) Jordan Pickford – £30m/€34m (Sunderland to Everton, June 2017)\nThere was mild disbelief at the time and some remain unconvinced but Everton signed Pickford upon his relegation to the Championship with Sunderland and no individual has played a bigger role in ensuring the same fate has not befallen the Toffees since.",
      "",
      "9) Aaron Ramsdale – £30m/€35.5m (Sheffield United to Arsenal, August 2021)\nSuccessive Premier League relegations with Bournemouth and Sheffield United did not deter Arsenal, who planned to bleed Ramsdale in slowly before realising he’s rather good. But not as good as…",
      "",
      "10) David Raya – £27m/€31.9m (Brentford to Arsenal, July 2024)\nAn initial loan was only ever designed to circumvent PSR issues before eventually and inevitably being made permanent by Arsenal, who navigated some incredibly tiresome discourse around their goalkeepers and have been proven entirely right in making their ruthless upgrade.",
      "",
      "11) Alex Meret – £26.25m/€35m (Udinese to Napoli, July 2018)\nA Coppa Italia winner’s medal, saving from Paulo Dybala in the final shootout, and a Scudetto after fighting back from a rotational role to become regular starter again – that’s not a bad return.",
      "",
      "12) Giorgi Mamardashvili – £25m/€30m (Valencia to Liverpool, August 2024)\nWith a keen eye on the future, Liverpool signed Mamardashvili and lent him back to Valencia for one more campaign of seasoning before heading to Anfield to presumably challenge Alisson for the gloves.",
      "",
      "13) Manuel Neuer – £24.3m/€30m (Schalke to Bayern Munich, June 2011)\nBayern Munich supporters quite hilariously protested against the signing of Neuer over some daft grudge to do with Oliver Kahn. Twelve Bundesligas and a couple of Champions Leagues might have won them over by now.",
      "",
      "14) Francesco Toldo – £23.85m/€28.4m (Fiorentina to Inter, July 2001)\nThe prospect of following Buffon was reportedly one factor behind Toldo rejecting a move to Parma during the great Italian goalkeeper merry-go-round of 2001. I Gialloblu signed Sebastien Frey from Inter instead, leading Toldo straight into the arms of I Nerazzurri for the same fee Parma had previously agreed with Fiorentina, who replaced the outgoing Italy international with Arsenal champion and Liverpool legend Alex Manninger.",
      "",
      "15) Neto – £23.3m/€26m (Valencia to Barcelona, June 2019)\nAs part of the bloated Cillessen deal, Barcelona received Neto in exchange as back-up for Marc-Andre ter Stegen.",
      "",
      "16) Bernd Leno – £22.3m/€25m (Bayer Leverkusen to Arsenal, June 2018)\nArsenal signing a German goalkeeper evoked all sorts of beautiful memories but Leno was neither mad nor Invincible. He replaced Petr Cech before himself being phased out for Ramsdale, as the circle of life between the Emirates sticks dictates.",
      "",
      "17) Djordje Petrovic – £22m/€28.8m (Chelsea to Bournemouth, July 2025)\nThe Chelsea transfer ethos in action: a player they signed for £12m on a seven-year contract and who played as many games for the Blues as Strasbourg was sold for almost twice as much within two years.",
      "",
      "18) Edouard Mendy – £22m/€24m (Rennes to Chelsea, September 2020)\nHe came, he saw, he looked genuinely brilliant at times, he won the Champions League, Super Cup, Club World Cup, Africa Cup of Nations, Best FIFA Men’s Goalkeeper award and Champions League Goalkeeper of the Season award all within a few months of each other, he had some contractual disagreements, he lost his place, he left for Saudi Arabia. What a whirlwind.",
      "",
      "19) Joan Garcia – £21.3m/€25m (Espanyol to Barcelona, June 2025)\nArsenal were known to be sniffing around but with Barcelona eager to enact a Ter Stegen succession plan, they triggered Garcia’s release clause to make their first signing direct from Espanyol in 31 years.",
      "",
      "20) Pau Lopez – £21m/€23.5m (Real Betis to Roma, July 2019)\nWith not a single competitive appearance for Spurs in an all-fated 2016/17 loan under his arm, Lopez bounced back with a season at Real Betis impressive enough to catch the eye of Roma, who he left to join Marseille for about half of Roma’s initial outlay two and a half years later.",

      "After Aston Villa decided against taking up their option to buy Rashford after his temporary move in January, it is understood that Man Utd ‘not interested in sending the English star out on loan again’.",
      "There have been rumours that Jose Mourinho is interested in a reunion with Rashford at Fenerbahce and now Haber Global TV Sports Director, Sercan Hamzaoğlu, claims that Fenerbahce will ‘take the lead in this transfer’ if most major European clubs decide they can’t pay for the Man Utd forward.",
      "Hamzaoğlu wrote on X: ‘Fenerbahçe inquired about Marcus Rashford’s conditions Fenerbahçe has not made an official offer for the English footballer but has made contact to inquire about the player’s demands. If Rashford gives the green light to playing in Turkey, Fenerbahçe will knock on Manchester United’s door with an official offer.",
      "‘Rashford has received numerous offers from the Premier League, La Liga, and major European teams. In particular, one of Europe’s biggest clubs, Barcelona, wants the player. However, no club has yet been able to meet the player’s financial demands. If the offers he wants from Europe’s top leagues don’t come through, Rashford might consider Turkey. In that case, Fenerbahçe would take the lead in this transfer.’",
      "After the arrival of Mbeumo, Turkish website Aksam insists that Man Utd have ‘put aside’ €30m (£26m) for the signing of former Norwich City star Sara, who contributed two goals and ten assists in 45 matches last season for Galatasaray.",
      "Aksam add: ‘On the other hand, it has been claimed that Gabriel Sara is keen on playing in the Premier League and could play for Manchester United in the new season.",
      "‘If an agreement is reached between the parties, Gabriel Sara will sign for United and restart his Island adventure.’",
      "Marcus Rashford has reportedly sanctioned a gargantuan pay cut to facilitate his loan to Barcelona, who have a ‘verbal agreement’ with Manchester United.",

      "Manchester United have agreed a £71m fee with Brentford for Bryan Mbeumo but once Sir Jim Ratcliffe remembers he ‘won’t be held ransom’ they will need to find an alternative.",
      "After starting the bidding at £50m rising to £55m in early June and privately stressing the need to be patient, Manchester United have found an agreement with Brentford worth an initial £65m with £6m in add-ons.",
      "It is exceptional work as ever from the recruitment team, who might soon get cold feet and need to look at some alternatives.",
      "We took a look at FBRef for options across Europe’s top five leagues that have very similar characteristics to Mbeumo, which amusingly features one current Manchester United player they’re desperate to be rid of and one a club has just made a £40m profit on after signing him from United two years ago.",
      "",
      "Alex Berenguer (Athletic Club)\nProbably not the Athletic Club forward the fans would be dreaming of signing this summer, but if Barcelona and Arsenal can’t persuade Nico Williams to join them there’s not much hope for United. And they in turn are in absolutely no position to be sniffy about a 30-year-old winger who got more league goal contributions (14) last season than any of their players aside from Bruno Fernandes (18).",
      "",
      "Mattia Zaccagni (Lazio)\nThere’s interest from Nottingham Forest in the Lazio captain as they prepare for inevitable defeat to Tottenham in the not-so-secret Morgan Gibbs-White release clause saga, and without the funds to build a squad which aligns with the fanciful INEOS strategy of developing young talent with significant sell-on value, moves for relatively inexpensive but experienced footballers like Zaccagni make a lot of sense. It’s a ploy that’s worked famously for Inter Milan.",
      "",
      "Xavi Simons (RB Leipzig)\nHe’s a player we’re sure United would have been making a move for had they qualified for the Champions League – he would be ideal in the 3-4-3. As it stands, their Europa League vanquishers Tottenham are interested, as are Bayern Munich. Probably Bayern Munich then.",
      "",
      "Anthony Gordon (Newcastle)\nThe supposed similarity between Gordon and their primary target should perhaps raise United alarms as to the suitability of Mbeumo to the inverted winger role as Gordon is a proper winger’s winger – paint on the soles of his boots and all that.",
      "That said, we’re pretty sure Amorim wouldn’t turn down the opportunity to sign Gordon should he miraculously become an option.",
      "",
      "Alex Iwobi (Everton)\nHe was low-key excellent last season, with his nine Premier League goals and six assists comfortably beating his best previous return of 11 goal contributions in 2018/2019 for Arsenal. Primed for a £20m late-window bid before Fulham ask for an added £20m in United tax.",
      "",
      "Inaki Williams (Athletic Club)\nCan’t be easy living in his brother’s shadow, though we’re guessing the £220,000 Inaki gets a week to play football eases the pain somewhat. He’s not about to leave a club in the Champions League and even United won’t fork out those wages.",
      "",
      "Marcus Rashford (Manchester United)\nJust brilliant. Not just because United are doing everything in their power to get him out of the club but also because he was deemed unsuited to Amorim’s system in the short time he was playing for him.",
      "And yes, we get the argument that Amorim has shown strength of character in showing ‘bad apples’ the door no matter their talent, but there won’t be a Red Devils fan out there not wondering – even briefly – whether a softer approach may have led to Rashford thriving at his boyhood club rather than at Aston Villa in the second half of last season and wherever he finds himself next term while United pay half his wages.",
      "",
      "Anthony Elanga (Newcastle)\nWe’re 99 per cent sure United would have rivalled Newcastle for Elanga’s £55m signing this summer had it not required an embarrassing climbdown after they sold him to Nottingham Forest for £15m two years ago.",
      "A report emerged after his stunning goal against United in April that while ‘there was an appreciation at the club for his phenomenal physical talents’, the club let him go due to ‘reservations over how he would parlay those skills into breaking down stubborn defences’.",
      "United do not now hold what we would suggest would have been the very same ‘reservations’ back then over a move for Mbeumo.",
      "",
      "Justin Kluivert (Bournemouth)\nHe’s someone we could genuinely see United genuinely pivoting to if they miss out on Mbeumo. A 26-year-old who’s perfect for one of those roles behind the central striker, coming off the back of a standout season playing for a club not in European competition with no more than an outside chance of achieving that feat in the coming campaign. A prime candidate.",
      "",
      "Cody Gakpo (Liverpool)\nBayern are supposedly keen and we’re currently at a point where we wouldn’t be particularly surprised by any forward either leaving or joining Liverpool. We would be surprised if any of them joined Manchester United.",
      "Marcus Rashford has reportedly sanctioned a gargantuan pay cut to facilitate his loan to Barcelona, who have a ‘verbal agreement’ with Manchester United.",

      "Aston Villa did a Chelsea by selling their women’s team to themselves to avoid a PSR breach and remove the need for unwanted player trading before June 30.",
      "But Villa’s ambitions on the pitch and in the transfer market mean they will likely need to stomach at least one high-profile departure this summer to create enough wiggle room in the current transfer window and beyond, with the amortisation of player registration costs meaning it pays to sell players and sign new ones.",
      "A stupid rule but one we’re all stuck with for now. Anyway, we’ve ranked Villa’s top ten most valuable players according to Transfermarkt by the likelihood of them being sold this summer, and have even reassigned them to willing beneficiaries.",
      "",
      "10) Boubacar Kamara (£36m) – Manchester United\nLoved by Villa fans and underrated by the rest, they’re so, so much better when Kamara’s in the team. He’s worth more to Villa than just about any Premier League side other than United, who haven’t officially admitted to Manuel Ugarte being a stunning waste of £42m but essentially have by accepting that Casemiro in central midfield incredibly remains their reality for next season.",
      "",
      "9) Ezri Konsa (£30m) – Manchester City\nWe really like Konsa and think he’s got as good a chance as anyone of starting the World Cup for England in Thomas Tuchel’s starting XI, though that perhaps sounds like higher praise than it actually is given the dearth of quality in that particular area of the pitch for the Three Lions.",
      "Anyway, he’s great and Villa shouldn’t sell him.",
      "But no-one’s untouchable in their circumstances and we’ve got a strong suspicion that City are walking into a season with a dodgy mix of young and injury-prone centre-backs.",
      "Neither Abdukodir Khusanov nor Vitor Reis convinced after arriving in January, and while the former showed signs he could develop into a quality defender, he may not be granted the luxury of easing into Premier League football when all of Manuel Akanji, John Stones and Nathan Ake are nailed on to be out of action for at least half a season.",
      "And even without widespread injury problems, we reckon Konsa would stand a very good chance of being first choice should he make the switch to the Etihad.",
      "",
      "8) Youri Tielemans (£33m) – Real Madrid\nWith Eduardo Camavinga and Aurelien Tchouameni as his defensive midfield options, “Xabi is missing his ‘Xabi’,” sources close to the Real Madrid coach told ESPN. A’ deep-lying midfielder who can serve not only as a defensive asset but also a playmaking monster’ is essentially a description of Tielemans, who was linked with a move to the Bernabeu towards the end of his Leicester days.",
      "Villa will be loathe to lose him and we are just as uncomfortable at the thought of him not gliding across Premier League pitches next season.",
      "",
      "7) Pau Torres (£28m) – Real Madrid\nAlonso’s other Madrid priority is a new centre-back as David Alaba and Eder Militao continue to struggle with injuries while Antonio Rudiger looked at the Club World Cup as though age and years of sh*thousery are catching up with him.",
      "That leaves Alonso with young pair Dean Huijsen and Raúl Asencio, and after Torres very nearly moved to the Bernabeu in 2021, reports in April claimed Madrid were again keeping tabs on the 28-year-old.",
      "Our guess is Torres would be somewhere near the bottom of this ranking if it were up to Emery, who counted on the Spain international at Villarreal before signing him for Villa. But a decent offer for a player whose value is only going in one direction should be welcomed.",
      "",
      "6) Ian Maatsen (£24m) – Borussia Dortmund\nHis was far from the most suspicious PSR-swerving deal last summer. About four weeks before his move to the Midlands, Maatsen started the Champions League final for Borussia Dortmund and was named in that season’s team of the tournament. As an isolated deal, there could be no complaints.",
      "But we all smelled a rat given his deal was tied inextricably to Omari Kellyman’s opposite move to Chelsea.",
      "Just ten Premier League starts and a season of playing second fiddle to Lucas Digne provided decent further evidence of the transfer not being one Emery was calling out for last summer, which suggests he would be very much open to Maatsen once again being used as a pawn in this grim game of FFP chess they’re playing with whoever’s amenable.",
      "Short of a PSR pal both willing to sign Maatsen and able to attract him, a return to Dortmund it is.",
      "",
      "5) Amadou Onana (£43m) – Tottenham\nA bit of a shock for him to be Villa’s second-most valuable asset but that’s as much to do with him being 23 as it is his footballing quality, which is only good enough for the bench in Emery’s first-choice XI, with Kamara and Tielemans the undoubted best partnership at the base of midfield.",
      "That surely makes Onana a standout candidate to be shipped out, and without an obvious team outside of the Premier League willing to pay the usual premium for an as yet unproven midfielder at the very highest level, the Arsenal avenue presumably now closed following their signings of Martin Zubimendi and Christian Norgaard and typically willing patsies for such signings Manchester United too cash-strapped to consider a bid, a move to Tottenham makes the most sense.",
      "They haven’t really got any defensive midfielders having not bothered with that sort of thing for a while, mate. And while Archie Gray is presumably still the long-term plan, he’s still a bit young and daft.",
      "",
      "4) Morgan Rogers (£48m) – Chelsea\nWhat absolutely none of us want is for Rogers to sign for a club that’s not going to play him in the season before a World Cup. The ideal would be for Rogers to be playing regularly for a team competing in the Champions League and challenging for trophies in a tournament campaign.",
      "Either of those things could happen at Chelsea, who have reportedly made him their ‘top target’ as they seek one more forward in preparation for the departures of Christopher Nkunku, Joao Felix and possibly Nicolas Jackson, whom Villa themselves are supposedly interested in.",
      "Villa have slapped an £80m price tag on him, presumably to ward off suitors rather than encouraging them as the 22-year-old – on the back of Marcus Rashford and Marco Asensio leaving after their loan spells – is the only clear hope for the future in Unai Emery’s attack. Then again, £80m is a lot of PSR wiggle room.",
      "",
      "3) Ollie Watkins (£36m) – Manchester United\nIt’s hard to imagine this summer transfer window not ending with Manchester United paying over the odds for Watkins having made a few quid on a couple of the bomb squad members when desperation to be rid of them sees lowball offers welcomed with open arms.",
      "Rasmus Hojlund struck what we would suggest is a HUGE BLOW by revealing he wants to stay at Old Trafford and fight what will presumably be a losing battle to start as United’s No.9 whether he actually has anyone to compete with for that position or not. Watkins’ reported interest in a move to United is likely as much to do with him being absolutely assured of a starting spot as much as anything else.",
      "Emery’s never been entirely convinced by Watkins, often starting Jhon Duran and then Rashford ahead of him, and given he turns 30 in December it feels like a good time to cash in, even if not quite at the full £60m they’re asking for.",
      "",
      "2) Leon Bailey (£24m) – Fenerbahce \nIt’s never quite worked for Bailey at Aston Villa but he’s by no means been terrible to the point where his value has plummeted – they bought him in 2021 for around £27m.",
      "Reports suggest Fenerbahce want a loan but Villa will hold out for his permanent transfer and a fee close to his valuation. Our guess is they may end up accepting a fair bit less to get him out of the door and off the wage bill.",
      "",
      "1) Jacob Ramsey (£28m) – Nottingham Forest\nForest want Ramsey as a replacement for Tottenham-bound Morgan Gibbs-White and this is the one with the most legs it seems, mainly and depressingly thanks to the two-word scourge of football – pure profit.",
      "We won’t get started on the ball-aching insanity of football clubs being encouraged to sell homegrown talent above all others to meet PSR demands, but it’s f***ing bullsh*t and looks set to force a transfer which we’re guessing neither Ramsey nor Villa actually want to happen.",
      "Former Liverpool and England striker Emile Heskey has warned Chelsea against signing Aston Villa attacker Morgan Rogers this summer.",
      "Liverpool are now preparing their second offer for Hugo Ekitike after Eintracht Frankfurt rejected their opening bid, according to reports.",

      "Saturday 19 July 2025 21:51, UK",
      "Manchester United began their pre-season campaign with a goalless draw against newly-promoted Leeds in Stockholm.",
      "After Ruben Amorim's side recorded their worst-scoring Premier League campaign last term with 44 goals, there were little signs of improvement in front of goal despite starting new £62.5m signing Matheus Cunha, who played the first half.",
      "In fact, Leeds arguably looked the most threatening over the course of the 90 minutes, with Daniel Farke's side having more of the ball in the first half and plenty more chances to take the lead after half-time.",
      "Teenage striker Chido Obi, who started alongside Cunha and Bruno Fernandes in Amorim's attack, had United's best first-half opportunities as he tested Karl Darlow from a tight angle.",
      "The 17-year-old then took the ball off Cunha's toes inside the area - a demonstration of the work still to be done on the training ground to get Amorim's attack on song. Casemiro's deflected cross also crashed off the Leeds crossbar in first-half stoppage time.",
      "Amorim then changed his entire starting XI at half-time but it was Leeds, who also made wholesale changes including giving a debut to Sean Longstaff, who had the better of the second period.",
      "Half-time substitute Joel Piroe set up two big chances for Jaden Bogle and two for Largie Ramazani, but the Whites could only find Tom Heaton's gloves on every occasion. Ao Tanaka also fired wide after a corner was flicked into his path at the far post.",
      "Amorim's United thought they had a penalty when Patrick Dorgu was brought down by Sam Chambers but the referee waved it on, with the wing-back then forcing Illan Meslier into a decent save.",
      "Man Utd then had the best chance of the afternoon as the clock ticked into 90 as Kobbie Mainoo hit the bar from a corner from just two yards out, with Ayden Heaven finding Meslier on the rebound from a similar distance.",
      "Their problems were summarised with their last big chance of the game as Rasmus Hojlund got in the way of Dorgu's goal-bound effort.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo is on his way to complete a £71m move to Manchester, but there is still a lot left to be desired about Amorim's attack on the basis of this showing.",

      "\"We have a lack of pace. Especially in the middle of the park, you can feel it's hard to bring the ball. But we created chances. We have a lot to do, but it was a first test against a Premier League team with two different teams. A good test.",
      "\"Matheus Cunha showed what we need, a player in between the lines who is really aggressive. We watched that during last season for a different team [Wolves]. We expect the same thing.",
      "\"You can see the connection with him and Bruno Fernandes is still not there. But it will be a good connection, because you can put a player like Kobbie Mainoo or Mason Mount there. We need to increase our quality in the final third.\"",

      "\"The environment is really good. Of course sometimes we are going to struggle, but what I felt in the first moment is that if we are going to struggle, we will struggle together. That is the beginning of everything. Then we have to put the quality. This club is not just about the effort, it's about the quality. We have to win games.",
      "\"We need to create that bond between everybody [on the United States tour] - not just between the players butthe staff. All the changes are stopping. We need to leave that as a group.",

      "Manchester United, it's almost like you never left.",
      "Yes, it's the first game of pre-season which can lead to freak results anywhere. But no goals from 19 shots, players missing from a few yards out and even team-mates getting in the way of each other. A lot of work is needed on Amorim's training ground.",
      "A lot of eyes were on Cunha's first run-out but his 45 minutes featured very few sparks. The £62.5m signing from Wolves failed to get a shot away and to touch the ball in the opposition box.",
      "Obi taking the ball off Cunha's toes and Amorim admitting his relationship with Fernandes \"is not there yet\" meant it was a slow start in his new colours.",
      "And Hojlund's display showed more frustration - falling over the ball at one stage in the box and then getting in the way of a late Dorgu strike.",
      "There were a few positives for Amorim as Leon looks a promising player at wing-back - though he was caught ball-watching at times as Leeds and Bogle rampaged down his flank.",
      "Goalkeeper Heaton was one of the few United players who came out of that game with a bit of credit, making three or four sharp saves to put his name in the hat for the United No 1 spot, with Andre Onana currently out injured. Talk about scraping the barrel though…",
      "Amad Diallo also looked sharp at wing-back - which is important in the context of Mbeumo coming into the team.",
      "But United need a lot more than the Brentford man to improve this attacking set-up. There's still a need for a new striker, plus more clarity in midfield and out wide.",

      "After weeks of protracted talks and rejected bids, the clubs agreed a package on Friday that includes a guaranteed £65m payment to be made in four instalments, as well as £6m in add-ons.",
      "United hope the Cameroon international's move will be completed in time to include him on the plane to the USA on Tuesday for their pre-season tour, and as their second signing of the summer after Matheus Cunha joined from Wolves.",
      "United had been in talks with Brentford for over month for Mbeumo, making a previous offer of £55m plus £7.5m in add-ons over a fortnight ago, which was rejected.",
      "That was after Spurs had held talks with Brentford for the player, with Thomas Frank keen to bring him to North London.",
      "But Mbeumo, who had two years left on his Brentford contract, always preferred a move To Old Trafford.",
      "It is understood the add-ons for Mbeumo are very achievable - mostly based on appearances and goals in the Premier League, meaning it is likely Brentford get close to £70m for him.",
      "If United can resurrect their trophy-winning form under Ruben Amorim then it is even more likely the fee reaches the full £71m.",
      "The likely extras mean Brentford stand to make more than £60m in profit on a player they signed for just £4m from Troyes in 2019, and who went on to score 70 goals, as well as making over 50 more for team-mates.",
      "United had been encouraged and impressed by Mbeumo's desire to join them, but Brentford have made it clear they would find it difficult to sell both him and Yoane Wissa, with interest intensifying in the Congo striker in the last week.",
      "Newcastle stepped their pursuit after seeing Liverpool move ahead of them in the race for Hugo Ekitike. Nottingham Forest also had a bid rejected for Wissa, while Spurs have been considering him since January.",
      "It may be the case that this shift in dynamic around Wissa sparked United into their successful offer for Mbeumo, with a striker next on the agenda for Amorim and the recruitment hierarchy.",
      "They have explored the conditions of a deal for a number of strikers including Aston Villa's Ollie Watkins, Sporting's Viktor Gyokeres, and Chelsea's Nicolas Jackson.",
      "United have been tracking his development for a number of years, back to when he was playing for RB Salzburg, and while Arsenal held preliminary talks for Sesko, a deal never progressed and they are now close to signing Gyokeres.",
      "A heavy focus for Manchester United will also be on exits.",
      "Barcelona have reached a broad agreement to sign Marcus Rashford on loan, while Alejandro Garnacho, Antony, Jadon Sancho and Tyrell Malacia have been given extra time off to explore potential moves away.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo scored 20 goals in the Premier League last season to help Brentford secure a top-half finish - only three players scored more.",
      "He also notched seven assists but should have registered more, clocking a league-topping 9.26 expected assists during the campaign - primarily from delivering a table-topping 202 crosses.",
      "Additionally, only two players covered more distance or attempted more sprints for the season, making him one of the hardest grafters in the league. He also provides serious pace - clocking the fourth-fastest speed at 36.63 km/h.",
      "Factoring in decisive goals or assists that changed the outcomes of games, his 27 goal contributions earned Brentford 22 points - equating to 40 per cent of the Bees' season tally.",

      "Man Utd made a quick and assertive start to the summer transfer window by signing Matheus Cunha, and have been pursuing Brentford's Bryan Mbeumo, while Bruno Fernandes has turned down a move to Saudi Arabia; how could all three fit into Ruben Amorim's team next season?",
      "Saturday 19 July 2025 12:51, UK",
      "Manchester United's road back has begun.",
      "For all the disappointment of last season's 15th-place finish and no trophies to soften the blow, there have been some minor reasons to be optimistic about the current campaign.",
      "Matheus Cunha is in the building after his move from Wolves - but he may not be the only major forward coming into Old Trafford. Bryan Mbeumo's preference to join United - despite other elite clubs in the running - is a positive sign, with agreement having now been reached over a £71 million deal for the Cameroon international.",
      "On top of that, captain Bruno Fernandes has turned down the temptation of a money-fuelled Saudi Arabia move that could have given United more money to rebuild the team. The project is far from being alive again, but it's a start.",
      "\"Cunha and Mbeumo have Premier League experience, and are the right type,\" said Gary Neville. But that is not the only reason those two have been categorised as the answer to United's problems.",
      "Putting the ball in the back of the net proved to be an issue for United last season. They ranked sixth for chances created but finished second bottom for converting shots into goals, while they were also fourth bottom for shot accuracy.",
      "Overall, United failed to score in 15 Premier League matches last season - only relegated Southampton and Leicester managed more. Eleven of those matches were under Amorim.",
      "They also had the second-worst Expected Goals underperformance record in the division, with the numbers saying they should have scored at least nine more goals than their final league tally of 44.",
      "This is where Cunha and Mbeumo could help - if last season's performances are anything to go by.",
      "As United floundered in front of goal, Mbeumo was the league's best overperformer in terms of xG. Using the same process as above, the Bees forward scored seven more goals than he should have done, with Cunha ranking third in the same category.",
      "Cunha and Mbeumo could therefore bring that clinical edge that United are missing. But would they go straight into the team - and if so, where?",
      "Amorim has repeatedly said he will not deviate from his way of playing via the 3-4-2-1 formation. The plus point for Cunha is that Vitor Pereira used the same system at Wolves in the second half of last season.",
      "Cunha turned out in the 'left No 10' role in Pereira's system and while the forward's 15-goal league season saw him strike consistently across the campaign, it arguably hit top gear under Pereira.",
      "Cunha scored in Pereira's first two matches in charge from that position, while he then hit five goals across seven straight games between the start of February and April.",
      "The issue with Cunha playing that role in United colours? Bruno Fernandes. He is the most common appearance maker in that 'left 10' role since Amorim took charge.",
      "The United captain ended the season a little bit deeper, actually playing as one of the two sitting midfielders, with Mason Mount taking that 'No 10' role ahead of him. It was that same set-up when United lost the Europa League final to Spurs.",
      "But is it so simple that Fernandes will settle for the deeper role and Cunha sits in front of him? Firstly, there are doubts about the balance of United's team, but there is a heavier dilemma at play.",
      "At Sporting, that same No 10 role belonged to Pedro Goncalves, also known as Pote. He was not necessarily the star of the team but very much the attacking engine of it.",
      "While players like Viktor Gyokeres took the headlines, Pote engineered a lot of the attacking combinations - he got 30 goals and 27 assists during the final 73 league games of Amorim's Sporting era.",
      "So that pocket of attacking space often belongs to the important cog of Amorim's team. The United head coach will need to determine whether that position at Old Trafford belongs to Fernandes or Cunha.",
      "Like Cunha, Mbeumo will be looking to turn his upward trajectory into some early form at Old Trafford.",
      "Only Mohamed Salah won more points for his team from goals and assists than the Brentford forward. His goal contributions didn't just put him among the league's best in terms of numbers, but also as one of the division's best at deciding games when it matters.",
      "While Cunha is eyeing up that 'left No 10' role, Mbeumo will be targeting the spot on the right. Going back to his Sporting days, Amorim's system always had a right-footed natural winger playing in that role - with Marcus Edwards and Francisco Trincao among those options in Lisbon.",
      "At United, Mbeumo will want that position - but so will Amad Diallo. The 23-year-old has spent most of the Amorim era at United on the injury table but has briefly shown glimpses of being the shining light in this dark period for the club.",
      "His goal and assist to win the Manchester derby at rivals City came from that 'Right No 10' position, as did his start in the Europa League final defeat, where he looked like the only player capable of breaking the deadlock against the Spurs defence.",
      "So, two things could happen if Mbeumo completes his Old Trafford move. Either the load on young prodigy Amad is lessened and the two compete for the same role. Or Amad is shifted to right wing-back.",
      "In Amorim's United system, the wing-backs appear to be the most scrutinised area of the pitch, alongside the No 10s - but the pursuits of Cunha and Mbeumo are addressing the latter.",
      "United's inability to have recognised options in at wing-back was symbolised by the early acquisition of Patrick Dorgu in January, who may not be the finished article but at least brought in a profile that United lacked.",
      "In an era where transitions from one pitch to the other and open spaces in wide areas are pretty common, efficient wing-backs are vital in any system like Amorim's.",
      "That has not just been evident in Pereira's 3-4-2-1 system at Wolves, but also at Oliver Glasner's Crystal Palace side. The industrious running of Daniel Munoz and Tyrick Mitchell was a key feature in the Eagles winning the FA Cup and reaching Europe, a level that United would even take right now.",
      "Meanwhile United's wing-back options, despite having a lot of running to do, are not among the league's elite runners, with Amorim once citing a \"lack of urgency to defend or attack the box\" as a contributor to defeats.",
      "But Amad has shown he can operate in that wing-back role. Amorim's first four Premier League games at United saw the youngster start in that position - he got four assists in that run. After a period further forward, his next start at wing-back ended in a late hat-trick against Southampton.",
      "And in another throwback to Sporting, Amorim even played then-17-year-old Geovany Quenda in that right wing-back role during his final few months at Lisbon, highlighting how he can give huge running responsibility to young and attack-minded shoulders.",
      "Cunha and Mbeumo's arrivals - one finalised and the other being plotted - are the first steps in United's blueprints in the bid to bounce back. They promise not only to change those two players' lives - but the responsibilities of those around them.",
      "Part of the reasoning for United going so many games without a goal was a lack of presence in the centre forward position.",
      "Rasmus Hojlund ended the season with the fewest shots and second-fewest Expected Goals per 90 out of any recognised forward in the Premier League last season. He also had 14 starts that failed to include a shot, while Amorim feels back-up Joshua Zirkzee is better off as a No 10 option.",
      "Both Cunha and Mbeumo share the same status when it comes to being a centre forward. They can do it if needed, but it's not their strong suit.",
      "Wolves boss Pereira even confessed Cunha was not a striker last season, when he was forced to play in that role in moments when Jorgen Strand Larsen was struggling with fitness.",
      "Mbeumo - meanwhile - has played centrally before for Brentford and Thomas Frank has highlighted the Cameroon international's hold-up play as one of his strong suits.",
      "But his forward's striker outings mainly came in a 3-5-2 set-up where he would work off Ivan Toney or Yoane Wissa, rather than be a focal point himself.",
      "United's pursuit of Liam Delap - who eventually chose Chelsea - demonstrated Amorim's desire to improve the centre forward area. Viktor Gyokeres' representatives were contacted about a potential move, but he is set to join Arsenal. Nicolas Jackson, Ollie Watkins and Benjamin Sesko are the other situations United are monitoring.",
      "While United have got off to a good start in the window, there is still work to do.",

      "Barcelona make Marcus Rashford their top left-wing target, according to Sky in Germany;  Barca are \"prepared to go all-in\" for the Manchester United forward; interest comes after Liverpool rejected Barca's advances for Luis Diaz, and Nico Williams' new deal at Athletic Club",

      "Manchester United forward Marcus Rashford is now Barcelona's clear left-wing target, according to Sky in Germany.",
      "Barca are expected to try and agree a deal and are \"prepared to go all-in\".",
      "This is because Liverpool have rejected their advances for Luis Diaz, and Nico Williams has signed a new deal at Athletic Club.",
      "The forward has returned to Carrington despite being offered extra time off and is training away from the first team, using the medical and rehab facilities.",
      "The 27-year-old is among five Man Utd players who can explore a potential move away after expressing a desire to leave.",
      "Matheus Cunha has taken the No 10 shirt from Rashford, who said he wanted a \"new challenge\" before joining Aston Villa for the second half of last season.",
      "There have been no official offers for Rashford after he returned from his loan at Villa.",
      "Barcelona remains Rashford's preferred destination should he leave United this summer.",
      "And, intriguingly, the door could be opening on a move to Catalonia.",
      "That's because in the past week, Barcelona have seen their hopes of landing either Liverpool's Diaz or Athletic Club's Nico Williams more or less extinguished.",
      "Financial issues remain a concern at Barcelona. They have tight financial parameters set by LaLiga and a recent history of failing to register players due to problems around funding those deals.",
      "Rashford's prospects of a switch to Barcelona look more likely now than they did two weeks ago - but how a deal will be structured will take some work given Barcelona's financial issues, Rashford's wages at Manchester United, and the Old Trafford club's preference to sell rather than sanction another loan.",
      "Read here for a 360 look at Rashford's future.",
