      "Ruben Amorim is set to take a hardline approach with his squad as they look to bounce back from a disappointing season. Manchester United endured their worst-ever Premier League campaign as they finished 15th and they also lost the Europa League final to Tottenham.",
      "United are set for a major overhaul this summer as Amorim looks to refresh his squad and the former Sporting boss is also planning an intense pre-season to ensure his players are ready to go when the new season starts.",
      "According to the Sun, non-international players are expected to return to Carrington 'earlier than normal' and some could even be back in training before the end of June. Amorim is said to be demanding 'sky high' fitness levels from his players and that he is ready to axe them if they do not meet his standards.",
      "It is claimed Amorim has even asked his players about their holiday plans, with the Portuguese attempting to leave no stone unturned as he bids to turn things around. The report adds that he wants United to start the season strong as rivals Manchester City and Chelsea could have a 'disrupted' start to their campaign due to the Club World Cup.",
      "The final of the revamped tournament takes place on July 13, just one month before the new season starts. A club source is quoted as saying: \"Amorim needs a good pre-season. He's not shied away from the pressure he's under.",
      "\"He would have always preferred to have arrived at United ahead of a new season rather than in the middle of it. He has to get this right. He's told the players there are no more excuses. His job is on the line — and so too is theirs. The club can't accept any more failures.\"",
      "After United's final game of the season, a 2-0 win over Aston Villa at Old Trafford, Amorim delivered an impassioned speech to supporters where he promised them that \"the good days are coming\".",
      "He said: \"I want to apologise for this season. I know you are really disappointed with me and with the team. The second thing I want to say is thank-you. We are very grateful for your support during the season, which I know was really bad.",
      "\"It was really hard in many games, but now, for me, we have to make a choice – stay stuck in the past - because this season is in the past, it's over. We fight each other or we stick together and move forward.",
      "\"Six months ago, in my first three games in charge, with two victories and one draw, I said to you the storm is coming, Today, after this disastrous season, I want to tell you - the good days are coming.",
      "\"If there is one club in the word that can overcome any situation, any disaster it is our club, Manchester United. I also want to say thank-you to my players. Sometimes I am not fair, but always I try to be honest with you. Thank you very much, see you next season.\"",

The Argentine forwards looks certain to leave Old Trafford after falling out with Ruben Amorim, who is said to have told the player to find a new club.",
      "Garnacho was benched by Amorim for the team's 1-0 Europa League final defeat to Tottenham and left out entirely for their final day of the season clash against Aston Villa. His manager reportedly told him \"you better pray that you can find a club to sign you\".",
      "The 20-year-old was forced to take part in the club's post-season tour to Asia despite being expected to depart and made it clear he was happy to return - after posting a picture of the airport runway with the caption \"finally\".",
      "Now Garnacho will be ramping up plans to leave United and Stamford Bridge is his No 1 choice, according to the Sun. The Blues were linked with the player in January, with his agents even being spotted in the stands at a Chelsea game.",
      "A source told the outlet he wants to stay in England, saying: \"Alejandro knows the Premier League is the best in the world. And while he has had some good moments at United, he wants to establish himself as a world star. England is the best place to do that and Chelsea have assembled a lot of good young players.\"",
      "Garnacho publicly expressed frustration with Amorim after being dropped against Spurs in Bilbao and didn't hold back as he admitted the team had a \"s***\" season.",

      "His brother Roberto also joined him in hitting out at Amorim, accusing the Portuguese coach of \"throwing him under the bus\".",
      "He said: \"Working as no-one else, helping every round, coming from two goals in the last two finals, just to be on the pitch for 19 mins and get thrown under the bus.\"",
      "It is claimed Garnacho's words did not go down well with some of United players, with the same source claiming he \"thinks he's the next Ronaldo\" and \"isn't quite as good as he thinks he is\".",
      "Garnacho joined United from Atletico Madrid as a 15-year-old and he has gone on to make 144 appearances for the club, scoring 26 goals. He has won the FA Cup and League Cup during his time at Old Trafford.",

Coming off the most productive season of his career, he netted 17 goals in 36 appearances for Wolves, scoring 15 of those goals in the Premier League.",
      "His starring role in maintaining the club's top-flight status has sparked intense transfer interest from clubs, with Manchester United leading the race for the Brazil international.",
      "Ruben Amorim's side have reportedly made positive contact with Cunha's camp over a summer move and plan to trigger his release clause of £62.5million ($83.7m), according to The Athletic.",
      "A payment plan is the current sticking point between the two clubs, with United proposing to spread the fee over five years but Wolves insisting they want it paid across three instalments within the next two years, reports the Express.",
      "Despite this, a deal is still hoped to be brokered for the 26-year-old, who already has extensive experience having played for five clubs across five countries, including his youth career in Brazil.",
      "Cunha’s path to the top began in 2017 when Eric Lovey spotted him playing for Brazilian side Coritiba’s youth team. Lovey, a former FIFA representative, was instrumental in the early career of Brazilian legend Ronaldinho serving as his confidante and agent and quickly became aware of Cunha’s potential.",
      "Recalling Cunha’s talent to Swiss newspaper Blick in 2018, Lovey revealed how he always had big plans for the youngster. \"As soon as I heard about him I wanted to follow his performances,\" Lovey said.",
      "\"During the Nike Cup in the USA he confirmed all the good things I had heard, especially against the Manchester United youth team. He was able to get the better of English players who were already adult-sized. I wasn't there myself but hearing about how he played reinforced my desire to work with him.\"",
      "Lovey's friendship with FC Sion president Christian Constantin saw him facilitate a move to Switzerland for Cunha who made a significant impact in the one season he spent there before RB Leipzig swooped in for his signature in 2018.",
      "Despite showing promise at Sion, the Brazilian struggled to replicate his performance in the Bundesliga, netting only nine goals over 52 appearances for Leipzig, culminating in a transfer to Hertha BSC eighteen months later.",
      "Hertha journalist Marc Schwitzky suggested a clash of styles between Cunha's \"free spirit\" approach and former Leipzig manager Julian Nagelsmann's tactical discipline may have hampered his success. \"Probably the move to Leipzig came a little too early for Cunha, who was just 19 years old at the time of the transfer,\" he penned.",
      "\"It is natural that settling into one of the best leagues in the world is difficult, especially for young players. In Cunha's case, however, there was also the fact that he wants to be an absolute free spirit on the field.",
      "\"At that time, his game was even wilder, even more individual. Julian Nagelsmann, then still coach at RB Leipzig, however, relies on a strong collective in which every player subordinates himself to the system and has to follow clear instructions.",
      "\"Cunha's talent flashed again and again at Leipzig, where he also provided great moments, but due to a lack of adaptability or tactical discipline, he was only used irregularly and thus again lacked consistency.\""

      "“Normally, it is a problem when a team has no offensive flow, but for Cunha, exactly this freedom was perfect, he blossomed completely.",
      "“Many games of the second half of 2020-21 became a Cunha show. Again and again he led the way with spectacular scenes, he didn’t seem to care about all the pressure of relegation, he was just happy to be able to play so much.",

      "The Saudi club are understood to have made the United captain a lucrative offer. Yet, they reportedly informed him that it is a one-time opportunity as they look to sign him within the next fortnight so he is eligible to play at the Club World Cup.",
      "Reports also state the 30-year-old is seriously considering leaving Old Trafford in a staggering £100million transfer after a dismal season under head coach Ruben Amorim, where United endured their worst ever Premier League finish.",
      "While it is still not clear whether Fernandes will part ways this summer, he once left Serie A side Udinese for similar reasons. The playmaker moved to Italy aged 17 and spent five years in Italy, initially at Novara before a move to Udinese in 2013.",
      "But after an impressive first season with the side, his manager Francesco Guidolin decided to step back from coaching, which played a key role in Fernandes leaving for Sampdoria in 2016. In a stark parallel to his time at United, Fernandes recalled that Udinese team having quality players but not being able to produce what was expected of them.",
      "He said in an interview with Cronache di Spogliatoio via Get Italian Football News: “The three years I spent at Udinese were not easy in terms of the team because we didn’t have great campaigns, except for the first one where we had a great squad. We had a strong team, but we weren’t able to achieve what was expected of us.",
      "“Then in the second and third year they decided to change manager after so long with Guidolin, and it didn’t go very well. Guidolin had managed to get the most of my abilities, and made me understand that I had to train more, but he had faith in me.”",
      "Fernandes, who joined United in January 2020 from Sporting CP, made the emotional admission years later that his time in Italy left him wanting to quit football altogether. It was there, whilst playing for Udinese, that he got extremely homesick and lonely, which forced him to reconsider his career path.",
      "Discussing his time in Serie A, he told the Players' Tribune: \"I was all on my own at 17 in a new country. I didn’t speak the language, and I didn’t know anyone, and let me tell you, it was hard. It was unbelievably hard and lonely. There were times when I wanted to quit, absolutely.\"",
      "Fernandes revealed it was his father who instilled a mentality in him to constantly strive for improvement, and admitted he would not have \"survived\" playing in Italy were it not for that attitude.",
      "After a season at Sampdoria, Fernandes returned to his homeland for Sporting, where he thrived before United came calling. He has comfortably been the Red Devils’ best performer since then, winning their Player of the Season award four times, including this campaign.",
      "Old Trafford chiefs are understood to be relaxed about his current situation, wanting to keep their talisman while still being prepared to entertain bids for any player.

      "With the Premier League season now over, clubs have already begun plotting their moves for the summer transfer window. While there are always many different plots unfolding at the same time, few will have as much focus as the situation around Marcus Rashford.",
      "The 27-year-old spent the second half of the campaign on loan at Aston Villa after being banished to the Manchester United wilderness by Ruben Amorim. Overall, the United academy graduate made a good impression at Villa Park, contributing four goals and six assists across all competitions, which earned him a recall to the England squad.",
      "The forward's next chapter is currently unknown, but with Amorim showing no signs that he has changed his stance, it is expected the Old Trafford exit door will be propped open for Rashford.",
      "In 17 appearances in all competitions, of which 10 were as a starter, Rashford contributed four goals and six assists. He made a variety of vital contributions, including his brace of assists in Villa's 2-1 victory over Chelsea as well as his impressive display against Paris Saint-Germain, when the Midlanders were so close to overturning a 3-1 aggregate deficit in the Champions League quarter-final.",
      "Under Emery, Rashford looked sharp, hungry, focussed and clinical. Villa fell just short of Champions League qualification, but Emery loves the Europa League and would want a squad that is good enough to battle in Europe and domestically.",
      "However, Villa already have the sixth-highest wage bill in the Premier League and may not be able to accommodate the £325,000-per-week Rashford is believed to be earning at United. From a football perspective, it looks to be a solid fit, but with a £40million buy option on top of a huge salary, the financial implications could be too steep for Villa.",
      "Tottenham Hotspur's dreadful Premier League campaign was overwritten by their Europa League triumph over United, which saw them qualify for the Champions League. The north Londoners' 17th-place Premier League finish was humiliating, but it's easy to forget the terrifying amount of injuries Spurs had to contend with.",
      "As well as losing key players like James Maddison, Dejan Kulusevski and Dominic Solanke to injury, captain and talisman Son Heung-min also endured a tough campaign, as his tally of seven goals in 30 Premier League appearances was his lowest since his debut campaign in the 2015/16 season, when he only contributed four goals in 28 appearances. With the South Korean losing his edge in front of goal this season, another forward with pace, directness and a clinical edge may be on Ange Postecoglou's radar.",
      "Rashford could be the perfect fit for the Tottenham boss, especially with his vast Champions League experience. If Tottenham are able to negotiate a good transfer fee with United, who will surely need to sell some players after missing out on the prize money for qualifying for the Champions League, Rashford may be ideal for Spurs.",
      "Along with Liverpool forward Luis Diaz, Rashford was recently name-checked by Barcelona manager Hansi Flick as a player they admire. The German said: \"I don't want to speak about players which are not in my team, but of course Luis Diaz and Marcus Rashford are fantastic players. I like them and we'll see what happens.”",
      "It's been widely reported that Rashford has ambitions of one day playing at the Nou Camp, but Spanish outlet Mundo Deportivo recently claimed that the forward's representatives told Barcelona officials he would be willing to lower his wages, to try and earn a move to the La Liga giants.",
      "Barcelona have established themselves as European heavyweights once more, winning La Liga and reaching the Champions League semi-finals. However, with Raphinha, Robert Lewandowski and Lamine Yamal leading the frontline, while Dani Olmo and Ferran Torres provide cover, Rashford may have to work hard to force his way into Flick's plans.",
      "If Barcelona make a serious proposal, it's likely Rashford would jump at the opportunity, but he would need to work harder and play better than he has ever before to dislodge the current stars in Catalunya.",
      "Scott McTominay took the bold decision to leave United and pursue pastures new at Napoli, and he was rewarded with a Serie A title and even a reception with the Pope.",
      "The Scot was a bit-part player at Old Trafford before Antonio Conte's side signed him for around £25.7m. Under the guidance of the ex-Chelsea manager, McTominay became an unstoppable goalscoring midfielder, contributing 12 goals and six assists in 34 appearances.",
      "How Rashford would relish the Conte treatment, which has also had a positive effect on another ex-United striker in Romelu Lukaku, who scored 14 goals and contributed 10 assists. Conte has demanded new signings, and with Napoli also being linked with Alejandro Garnacho in the past, it's possible Conte may prefer Rashford's experience and cutting edge.",
      "However, the biggest uncertainty is Conte's future, as Napoli president Aurelio De Laurentiis appeared to suggest the Italian could be leaving. He told Napoli fans at their open-top bus celebration: \"I wish Conte continuing success in his professional life. Thank you, Antonio.\"",
      "Rashford has also seen the likes of Tammy Abraham, Fikayo Tomori and Ruben Loftus-Cheek move to AC Milan and enjoy their football. A space could soon open up at the Rossoneri, as left-winger Rafael Leao currently has an uncertain future at the San Siro.",
      "Milan endured a difficult campaign this year, registering a disappointing eighth-place finish. New energy and a new attitude may be required to jumpstart the European giants, who won Serie A in 2022 and Rashford could be the one to provide that spark.",
      "Their lack of European football next season, though, may mean a move doesn't materialise, given the necessary funds involved.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more."

He was rewarded with 23 goals in 32 games as Sporting won the Portuguese title for the first time in 19 years, the following season.",
      "Manchester City will hold fresh talks with AC Milan over a £55m move for midfielder Tijjani Reijnders as Pep Guardiola looks to refresh his squad ahead of a renewed assault on all fronts next season.",
      "Netherlands international Reijnders has become one of Serie A’s highest-rated midfield players and City are keen to seal a deal early in the window, while the club retain a firm interest in Rayan Cherki, who is eager to move from Lyon.",
      "‌Kevin De Bruyne is unhappily leaving City and is fancied to join Napoli, while the futures of experienced figures Ilkay Gundogan and Bernardo Silva are unclear with Guardiola expected to revamp his midfield.",
      "Bruno Fernandes has a big decision to make – and whichever call he makes, he will likely have to abandon his previous plans. The Manchester United captain has been handed the opportunity of a mega-money move to Saudi Arabian side Al-Hilal, but is yet to make his mind up.",
      "Fernandes stands at a crossroads in his career following a dreadful campaign for United which saw them finish 15th in the Premier League and lose the Europa League final. After a miserable and embarrassing post-season trip to Malaysia and Hong Kong, he now has to decide whether to stick by United, or cash in with a move to Al-Hilal.",
      "The Saudi club are reportedly willing to pay United £100million to sign the Portugal international, who they will then pay £100m over the course of his contract. His agent Miguel Pinho has been in Riyadh for talks with the club’s executives this week and he reportedly has a week to decide, with Al-Hilal preparing for the Club World Cup.",

      "Stones, who has been a pivotal figure under Pep Guardiola, has been plagued by injuries for the last two seasons and hasn’t played since undergoing an operation to repair a hamstring tear he sustained in February.",
      "City signed young centre-backs Abdukodir Khusanov, Vitor Reis and Juma Bah in January and are also big admirers of Toffees star Jarrad Branthwaite. Stones has just a year left on his £250,000-a-week contract and would have to take a pay-cut to link up again with David Moyes.",
      "But City’s asking price is unlikely to be prohibitive and they are aware that the defender needs regular football to push for a place in England’s World Cup squad next summer.",
      "Liverpool have made an improved bid for Florian Wirtz which is closer to Bayer Leverkusen's £126million valuation. Wirtz, 22, is expected to sign a five-year contract at Anfield if the Reds strike a deal, as the Leverkusen star has already rejected Bayern Munich.",
      "It's understood that Liverpool lodged an opening bid of £85m earlier this week. Now, after seeing that deal turned down, they've moved again, with an offer worth a total £109m.",
      "This could be enough to tempt Leverkusen into a sale, with the Bundesliga club previously demanding £126m during talks with Bayern. But given that Liverpool are a foreign club, his asking price could be reduced. Wirtz wouldn't be the only Leverkusen player heading to Anfield, as the Reds have agreed to pay right-back Jeremie Frimpong's £29.5m release clause.",
      "Bayern chiefs appear to have accepted that Wirtz has chosen to join Premier League champions Liverpool, whose officials with the Germany international and his parents near Blackpool last week. Liverpool's pitch impressed the Wirtz clan, who've given the green-light for a move to Merseyside after making his name in the Bundesliga.",
      "The 2025 summer transfer window is open and it is set to get off to a flier with most of the Premier League ’s big guns expected to complete deals in the opening days.",
      "That is predominantly on account of the controversial new Club World Cup that sees Chelsea and Manchester City head to the United States next week for a financially-lucrative month of action that many players are unhappy to be a part of. But its consequences are extending into this summer’s recruitment as some clubs race to make signings so their new faces can compete.",
      "That includes Trent Alexander-Arnold signing for Real Madrid for £10m - despite being available for free at the end of the month. Equally several sides not competing in the CWC are getting active with Manchester United set to bring in Matheus Cunha from Wolves for £62.5m and Liverpool wrapping up a deal for Jeremie Frimpong, with Florian Wirtz potentially following right behind on the path from Leverkusen.",

      "Alejandro Garnacho looks destined for the Manchester United exit door after Ruben Amorim gave him his marching orders. It's set to be a sad end to what was hoped to be a hugely promising career at Old Trafford.",
      "The Argentine winger, 20, was tipped to follow in Cristiano Ronaldo's footsteps after breaking into the first team under Erik ten Hag. But he's fallen massively out of favour with Amorim, who is believed to have taken issue with his comments after the Europa League final defeat to Tottenham.",
      "Garnacho described United's season as \"s***\" and bemoaned his benching after playing in every prior round. According to the Daily Mail, Amorim responded by singling him out at an end-of-season meeting last weekend, with the United boss alleged to have said: \"You better pray that you can find a club to sign you.\"",
      "That comment all but confirmed that his Red Devils stay is over. Garnacho is believed to be valued in the region of £60-70million, but there's no shortage of potential suitors lining up to end his United nightmare, with the window now open from June 1 to June 10 due to the Club World Cup.",
      "Having already had a £40m bid rejected in January, the newly-crowned Italian champions are favourites to secure the youngster's signature. He's a natural replacement for Khvicha Kvaratskhelia, who departed Naples for PSG in the winter window.",
      "There's therefore no doubt that he could be a regular starter for Antonio Conte. And that's worked wonders for his former team-mate Scott McTominay, who's established himself as a club legend after just one season thanks to his goalscoring heroics.",
      "The i report that Napoli sporting director Giovanni Manna is set to meet with United officials to re-open talks for Garnacho. Whether they can meet in the middle of their valuations remains to be seen.",
      "A club that may be more likely to stump up the desired cash is Chelsea. There are no signs that Todd Boehly's wallet won't be flying open this summer like it has done for the last three years.",
      "The Blues might well need to add an extra incentive to persuade INEOS to strengthen a Premier League rival – but there's always a price. As usual, Enzo Maresca doesn't necessarily need yet another attacking option in his ranks.",
      "The future of Jadon Sancho remains up in the air, though. And with Noni Madueke and Pedro Neto being more natural fits on the right wing, there could be room for Garnacho in the XI.",
      "A return to the club where he spent five years of his youth career looks like another potential next move for Garnacho. He left to pursue his \"dream\" in 2020.",
      "A lot has changed since then and Atletico boss Diego Simeone is believed to be a big fan of their former academy prospect. He does, however, appear a less natural fit in Simeone's favoured 4-4-2 formation.",
      "Both Alexander Sorloth and Julian Alvarez enjoyed stunning seasons up top, scoring 20 and 17 league goals respectively. So Garnacho would likely have to drop a touch deeper and put in the legwork that Amorim has often accused him of lacking.",
      "He could enjoy more attacking freedom at the San Siro. Both Inter and AC have been linked with a swoop, but an exit for Rafael Leao could put the latter in the driving seat.",
      "Leao has been linked with a whole host of clubs, including United. There could be a swap deal to be made if Garnacho fancies it.",
      "Milan have been named in reports in Italy as one of the early movers to enter negotiations, alongside Napoli. But their lack of European football next season puts them on the back foot.",
      "The appointment of Ten Hag at the BayArena has naturally sparked suggestions of a reunion for Garnacho in Germany. Leverkusen certainly won't be short of funds this summer.",
      "Liverpool activating Jeremie Frimpong's £29.5m release clause, as well as reportedly closing in on a £100m-plus deal for Florian Wirtz, leaves Ten Hag with a tidy war chest to attack the window with.",
      "Garnacho's profile lends itself to success in Germany, and he was productive under the Dutchman for United. But it's perhaps a riskier move with the club in a transitional period following Xabi Alonso's exit.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more."

      "However, they did end the trip on a high note with a 3-1 win over Hong Kong thanks to a brace from Chido Obi and a goal from Ayden Heaven. United have now returned to Manchester and the majority are set to jet off on holiday before beginning their preparations for pre-season.",
      "Some were forced to cancel holidays as a result of the club's post-season tour and Garnacho appears to be delighted that the trip is now over, with the winger posting an image on Instagram of an airport runway with the caption \"Finally\".",
      "It remains to be seen whether Garnacho will still be a United player next season, having publicly expressed his frustration at being dropped to the bench for the Europa League final. \"Obviously it's hard for everyone,\" he said after the 1-0 defeat to Tottenham.",
      "\"Our season was s***. We didn't beat anyone in the league. We lacked a lot of things. When you don't score goals, you always need more. Until we reached the final, I played every round.",

      "Ruben Amorim's bid to make Manchester United play his way is facing an added complication because the club’s academy teams continue to use a tactical blueprint that doesn’t fit his philosophy.",
      "Amorim accepts that United are unable to spend their way back to the top after missing out on a £100million Champions League jackpot with defeat in the Europa League Final. And the Reds’ boss is ready to keep up the Old Trafford tradition of bringing through youngsters from United’s hugely-productive youth set-up during his rebuild after implementing a similar plan at Sporting Lisbon.",
      "But United’s academy teams are grounded to play a 4-3-3 system that Amorim has no faith in. And he feels the task of bedding young players into his senior squad is even tougher because of how they have spent their formative years.",
      "Old Trafford academy chiefs insist they continue to produce footballers with a skill-set to adapt to any tactical request - and Amorim has given first-team debuts this season to youngsters Harry Amass and Tyler Fredricson. He also included the likes of Dan Armer, Jaydan Kamason, Godwill Kukonki, Tyler Fletcher, Sekou Kone, Shea Lacey, Jack Moorhouse and Jim Thwaites in United’s squad for a post-season tour of the Far East.",
      "But there is a disconnect between the way United’s age-group teams play and how Amorim sets up his senior side.",
      "The Reds’ boss remains wedded to a formation that employs a three-man defence and demands that wing-backs provide attacking width. It was a philosophy that worked for him when he was building a reputation as one of Europe’s best coaches at Braga and Sporting.",
      "And he refused steadfastly to adapt his beliefs despite inheriting a United squad that struggled badly to meet their manager’s demands from the moment he took charge in November.",
      "A source said: “Amorim made it clear when he spoke to United about becoming the coach that he needed the freedom to play the way he did in Portugal. Sporting, like United, have a reputation for developing their own talent and their academy also traditionally used 4-3-3.",
      "“But when Amorim became the coach there was also a shift towards 3-4-3 and 3-4-2-1 at youth level to mirror the first team.",
      "“If you look at how Sporting played in the UEFA Youth League this season, you will see that they played with all three formations.”",
      "Some of the problems Amorim inherited at Old Trafford mirror issues he dealt with ruthlessly when he became Sporting coach with 11 games of the 2019-20 season remaining. He immediately ditched the 4-2-3-1 formation employed by managerial predecessor Silas.",
      "Fans’ favourites like Marcos Acuna and Islam Slimani were sold after failing to buckle down to the new boss’ requirements in the same way that Amorim wants to move on Marcus Rashford and Alejandro Garnacho.",
      "A new data-driven approach to recruitment saw players like Pedro Concalves, Pedro Porro, Joao Mario, Nuno Santos, Zouhair Feddal and Bruno Tabata arrive that summer to help implement his tactical requirements.",
      "And the emergence of Matheus Nunes, Eduardo Quaresma, Nuno Mendes, Joelson Fernandes and Tiago Tomas from the youth system helped Sporting become Portuguese champions for the first time in 19 years with just one defeat all season.",
      "Sporting lifted the Portuguese title again under Amorim last year - and have retained the trophy this season despite successor Joao Pereira lasting eight games and current coach Rui Borges opting to use 4-4-2. When Amorim left the club to move to Manchester, his team were averaging 65 percent possession during domestic games.",
      "The United boss spoke often during his tough introduction to life in Manchester about being given the backing of United's owners.",
      "The source added: “Of course Amorim would like money to use in the transfer market.",
      "“But he also needs to be given the freedom to impose the methods he believes in on the club.”",

      "Pereira continued to build on his impressive performances in recent years since leaving United as he registered two goals and four assists in the middle of the park.",
      "He joined United as a 16-year-old in 2011 but found first team opportunities limited. He played just 75 times across four seasons and was loaned out to Granada, Valencia, Lazio and Flamengo before joining Fulham in a permanent move in 2022.",

      "Things got even more farcical after the conclusion of the 2024/25 season, as United headed out to the Far East on a two-game tour. They suffered the embarrassment of losing to an ASEAN All-Stars side in Kuala Lumpur, before coming from a goal down to beat Hong Kong.",
      "Amorim has won just 16 of his first 42 competitive games in charge since taking over from Erik ten Hag in November. His first six months at the club has been a massive disappointment and United are now braced to tear apart their squad in pursuit of improvements next season.",
      "But despite their struggles on the pitch, Amorim has won over summer signing De Ligt through his work in press conferences. The Portuguese coach said his side were “probably the worst in Manchester United history” in January before calling them “chokers” who deserved to be booed after losing in Malaysia.",
      "“I'm from Holland so I like it,” De Ligt said. “I can understand the media are in shock because normally this doesn't happen.",
      "“But I think you can also be really happy that finally someone speaks out, says what he thinks and speaks the truth. I really appreciate him in our conversations personally. It gives me a feeling I can trust him and he can trust me.”",
      "Amorim arrived at Old Trafford with a stellar reputation, having won two leagues and two cups with Sporting, but it hasn’t gone to plan at United. The 40-year-old inherited Ten Hag’s squad and has managed to connect with them, according to De Ligt, who joined for £42million from Bayern Munich last summer.",
      "“I've experienced many managers and he's one of the most easy to talk to as a player,” he said. “He's really into details. Before signing new players, first he's looking at the culture, what needs to change and what can be improved to become a better football club. From next season we will see more of that.",
      "“I think he wants to build a team of players who are together, fighting for each other and making the most out of what they have. Maybe before, you had the best players, but you're not a team.”",
      "After getting the post-season tour done, Amorim is already looking ahead to next season. \"Of course, to spend time with my family,\" he said after the game in Hong Kong. \"But, like I said in the press conference, I am ready to start the next one.",
      "“We have a lot to do. A lot to prepare. We have to think of the squad and we are changing building. It needs to be that everything is ready for the new season.\"",

      "Bruno Fernandes has a big decision to make – and whichever call he makes, he will likely have to abandon his previous plans. The Manchester United captain has been handed the opportunity of a mega-money move to Saudi Arabian side Al-Hilal, but is yet to make his mind up.",
      "Fernandes stands at a crossroads in his career following a dreadful campaign for United which saw them finish 15th in the Premier League and lose the Europa League final. After a miserable and embarrassing post-season trip to Malaysia and Hong Kong, he now has to decide whether to stick by United, or cash in with a move to Al-Hilal.",
      "The Saudi club are reportedly willing to pay United £100million to sign the Portugal international, who they will then pay £100m over the course of his contract. His agent Miguel Pinho has been in Riyadh for talks with the club’s executives this week and he reportedly has a week to decide, with Al-Hilal preparing for the Club World Cup.",
      "Amid the storm, Fernandes has stirred the pot by posting a Portuguese quote on Instagram which translates to: “If you tried and failed, congratulations! There are people who don't even try.”",
      "It will soon be crunch time for the 30-year-old midfielder, who is under contract with United until June 2027, although the club also have the option of another year. Fernandes has 98 goals and 87 assists in 290 games for United since joining them from Sporting Lisbon in January 2020 and has been captain for two seasons.",
      "Al-Hilal’s interest in his services is nothing new, but United’s dreadful form and need to rejuvenate their squad suddenly makes the move a distinct possibility. Whatever he does – stay with United, or move to Saudi Arabia – it now seems unlikely that Fernandes will not follow through with a previously-stated desire to play in Brazil.",
      "He will turn 31 in September and this summer’s decision would appear to rule out a future transfer to a Brazilian side further down the line. \"Whenever I can, I follow it, because I find Brazilian football attractive, electric football, with a lot of quality, joy, very one-on-one,” he previously said.",
      "\"It’s pure football. And I think that now, with the coaches that are there, not only the Portuguese, but also Brazilians, are increasingly developing in the tactical part.",
      "\"I don’t really like talking about the distant future, but it’s like I said. It’s attractive football, very interesting. The only thing is that the trips are very long there in Brazil! There are many competitions, many clubs that play Libertadores and Sudamericana, very good competitions. I’m not saying no, because Brazilian football is very attractive, and we never know the future.\"",
      "The contract reportedly on offer at Al-Hilal is worth a staggering £700,000 per week and would run for three years. At the end of that, he will be approaching 34 and could instead choose to move back to his native Portugal, rather than to South America, away from his extended family.",

      "The 21-year-old enjoyed an incredible season, scoring 12 goals and assisting 19 in all competitions, and with Lyon only mustering a sixth-placed finish he is now being tipped for a move to a top European club.",
      "Manchester United were previously tipped as a destination for Cherki, after watching him score twice against them in the Europa League this season. But after missing out on European football, a move to their rivals City looks more likely.",
      "According to French outlet Foot Mercato, a move to City is \"accelerating\" for Cherki - who was voted in the Ligue 1 team of the season following his sparkling creative displays.",
      "The report states City \"appreciate\" Cherki's talents and see him as an ideal replacement for the outgoing Kevin de Bruyne. Bayer Leverkusen's Florian Wirtz was previously a big target for City, but Bayern Munich and Liverpool have now jumped to the front of the queue.",
      "Cherki's preference is to play in the No 10 role - which is where City would want to play him, it goes on. The Sky Blues are now ramping up talks with the player's team and are \"very confident\" over a deal.",
      "The boyhood Lyon star has given the thumbs up over moving to the Etihad and is excited about the prospect of playing under Guardiola, who he has already spoken to - the report claims.",
      "Cherki wants to sort his future out as quickly as possible in a deal that could earn Lyon around £34m - though he does have a release clause of £25m. Cherki has a contract at Lyon that runs until next summer",
      "He has hinted he could have played his final game for Lyon after admitting he has \"done everything I could\" for the club, saying it will \"always be in my heart\".",
      "\"I don’t know,\" he said when asked about his future. \"In any case, I know I’ve given my all for the club. I’ve done everything I could for OL, because it’s a club I’ll never forget, one that will always be in my heart.",
      "\"I stayed when a lot of players left. Today, I have no regrets. Whatever happens, I’ll give my all to the last minute for the club. I’ve only got OL on my mind, and I’d never call on anyone else.\"",
      "Cherki joined Lyon aged six and began playing for its reserve team at the age of 15. He became the first team's youngest ever scorer at 16 in 2020 and has gone on to make 185 appearances, scoring 29 times.",

Signing a reliable striker has to be United's top priority this summer, making links with Sporting Lisbon's Viktor Gyokeres and Napoli ace Victor Osimhen understandable.

      "\"It's not going to change so much because we have the financial fair play rules,\" Amorim told the media in Malaysia. \"We are not allowed to do much in this summer, even with Champions League, so we are prepared for that.\"",
      "However, United plan to raise funds by selling attackers Alejandro Garnacho, Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho and Antony. Garnacho has been informed he can leave at the right price and Rashford, Sancho and Antony have been identified as priority sales.",
      "Rashford is available for £40m, Antony will be available for around £32.5m and Chelsea, who signed Sancho on loan last summer, have an obligation to buy him for a fee that could be as high as £25m. However, the Londoners can pay a £5m penalty not to sign him on a permanent basis.",
      "In addition, no other member of the squad is safe from being pointed in the direction of the exit. Bruno Fernandes is currently the subject of interest from Al-Hilal and it remains to be seen if the Saudi Arabia side will table a bid matching the £100m figure that has been touted. The United captain is understood to be considering the move.",

A decision on Casemiro's future could go either way after Amorim indicated the Brazilian had changed his mind amid the role he played in helping United reach the Europa League final."

      "\"When you are constantly thinking about where you are going to be next year, or you're travelling or not settled, it is about putting down roots. Not thinking about the financial side, for me it was all about where I was going to start feeling comfortable.",
      "\"I felt like I was at a crossroads where I could either peter out and drop down and keep not performing or seek help and really give this a go. Martin Perry has been unbelievable.",
      "\"Part of my routine is focusing on what is important. That has been so important to me, since I have been speaking to him, I have had to put in the work, but it all moulds into one and the outcome has been decent performances which wasn't the case in the last few years.\"",
      "Fletcher brings up his chats with Perry unprompted. It's not the first time he's used his services, having previously consulted him during a loan spell at Sunderland when the striker said he was 'having a tough time'. But that was seven years ago, when opening up to psychologists was perhaps not the done thing for a footballer.",
      "The landscape has changed and Fletcher seemingly feels a sense of responsibility in talking about his need for help. His career began at United, where he was on the fringes of the first team before deciding to leave Old Trafford in the pursuit of first team football in the Premier League at West Ham.",
      "He initially left on loan for League One side Barnsley, winning the Football League Trophy and third tier play-off final at Wembley during a hugely successful spell.",
      "But while he was at Oakwell, a striker vacancy at United opened up. Fletcher may well have been first in the queue. Instead, Will Keane was afforded an opportunity in an FA Cup tie against Shrewsbury Town and when injury struck him, Marcus Rashford was handed a chance and didn't look back.",
      "Fletcher didn't either. He didn't wonder what if, he simply thought what next?",
      "\"Everyone asks me with Marcus if you stayed would you have got an opportunity?\" he said.",
      "\"But football is sliding doors and I have no bitterness. Marcus has gone on to be what he is, which is a world-class player. He has done unbelievably well.",
      "\"For me I felt it was being real and that if there was an opportunity to go and play elsewhere in the Premier League then I should take it. It was lovely to see someone like Marcus who had come through from when he was five or six and for him to take that chance. I was happy with what I was doing.\"",
      "What Fletcher was doing was seeking minutes. His six months at Barnsley yielded eight goals in 16 games and two winning trips to Wembley. He wanted more. West Ham came calling, offering top flight chances and a four-year deal.",
      "\"I am a realist,\" he said of his decision to leave United when there was an offer on the table from the Reds.",
      "\"There was an opportunity before I left to go on loan to Barnsley where I could have been on the bench against Watford. One of my best mates in Sean Goss was on the bench and Marcus was on the bench and I wasn't picked.",
      "\"I was thinking then that it was going to be difficult. I went to Barnsley and concentrated on myself and that was the most important thing.",
      "\"It was my dream to play for United first team but my dream at the start was to play pro football. Even going out to Barnsley on loan was a great achievement for me but I wanted it to be the first step.\"",
      "West Ham offered a four-year contract, the promise of top flight football and an improved salary. Within months of signing he was back at Old Trafford, scoring for Hammers in the League Cup. A year later he joined Middlesbrough for £6.5million. He was a regular for three years at the Riverside before a move to Watford which didn't work out and led to a series of loans.",
      "Fletcher still speaks to former United teammates and he encounters plenty on a weekly basis in opposition line-ups.",
      "\"You look at the teams in the leagues that I play in and there is always one or two who have come through the academy at United,\" he said. \"That is a testament to the club for how good they are at producing good players, but also people with a good attitude who can survive in the football world.",
      "\"I can honestly say coming through there and growing up surrounded by greatness and eliteness, there is no better place to learn your trade, not just as a player but as a person.\"",
      "Fletcher's breakthrough into the senior squad was under Louis van Gaal, a man he has huge respect for even if that first team call never quite came.",
      "\"I loved Louis, I didn't train under Sir Alex, but Louis was top and he was really good for the young lads,\" Fletcher reflects.",
      "\"Being involved in the first team training environment was unbelievable. I was training with the first-team squad for a few months here and there.",
      "\"Louis was very methodical. A lot of drills specific to who we might be playing next but I loved it. Louis actually quite liked me from the feedback I got but at the time my body wasn't developed enough to play in the Premier League.",
      "\"I was training with Robin van Persie, Falcao, Rooney, Di Maria, the talent was ridiculous.",
      "\"I learned every day and I didn't feel out of place either. I just dreamt of getting an opportunity but it never came. But I am happy with how things worked out.\"",
      "And happy to talk, too. Fletcher will continue to do his talking on and off the pitch."

      "However, the value of the club is expected to drop when Forbes publish their list of world's most valuable teams in 12 months' time because the 2024/2025 season was a disaster.",
      "United lost against Tottenham Hotspur in the Europa League final last month, which means there will be no European football at Old Trafford next season. The club's financial picture looks bleak and the absence of European broadcast revenue is a huge blow to Ineos chiefs.",
      "in February, United published their financial figures for the final three months of 2024 and they confirmed broadcasting revenue had declined by 42 per cent to £61.6million. That was due to United playing in the Europa League instead of the Champions League this season.",
      "The results also showed total revenue was down 12 per cent from the same quarter in the previous year.",
      "United played two post-season friendlies this week to raise roughly £10m in cash."

      "Hello and welcome back to the Manchester United transfer blog on Sunday, June 1.",
      "The summer transfer window is officially open - at least for now. It will temporarily close on June 10 ahead of the FIFA Club World Cup, before reopening on June 16.",
      "United are aiming to complete their transfer business early, having already reached an agreement with Wolves for Matheus Cunha. Meanwhile, Ruben Amorim's side continue to be linked with additional attacking options to strengthen their current squad.",
      "Their hunt for a new striker has taken a setback with Liam Delap set to join Chelsea for £30million. The likes of Viktor Gyokeres and Napoli's Victor Osimhen are two prime targets after scoring a combined 91 goals between them this season.",
      "There have even been reports that recruitment director Matt Hargreaves is in Naples attempting to negotiate a deal. Osimhen is expected to push for a swift resolution, especially after his high-profile move collapsed on deadline day last summer.",
      "Sporting's Viktor Gyokeres has also been linked with United, largely due to his strong relationship with manager Rúben Amorim. However, the Reds appear to face stiff competition, with a growing queue of suitors that now reportedly includes Liverpool.",
      "However, further signings beyond a striker are unlikely to be pursued until funds are generated through player sales. Unfortunately, that could see Bruno Fernandes depart the club, amid continued links to a lucrative move to the Saudi Pro League.",
      "Sporting’s Pedro Goncalves has been earmarked as a potential replacement for the Portuguese captain.",
      "Stay tuned to all the latest news from United's summer transfer window below...",
      "Cunha was spotted outside The Lowry Hotel on Sunday morning, checking out with his family.",
      "Sources suggested Cunha was due to dine at The Ivy on Saturday night, but only the players' representatives and United's director of recruitment, Christopher Vivell, were spotted. The Brazilian headed to catch his flight to South America for international duty after leaving The Lowry Hotel.",
      "The 26-year-old has been identified as a specialist No.10 to bolster United’s attacking options behind the striker.",
      "Read more here.",
      "David Beckham believes Man United's players are not representing the club well away from the pitch.",
      "Aljenandro Garnacho and Amad were both pictured flipping their middle finger in contrasting circumstances on the tour, and Beckham has suggested the players behaved poorly.",
      "\"It’s tough times. I don’t like seeing some of things that are going on at the club,” Beckham told CBS Sports. \"On the pitch is what counts but in all honesty I’m seeing a lot of things that are not ok in my eyes as a fan and as a lover of Man United.",
      "\"You have to represent the badge. That’s what it is about. I’ve seen a lot of things where players are not acting in the right manner. We were a part of a team that was so well-mannered. We understood what it meant to play for Manchester United. We understood what the badge meant.",
      "\"Wherever we travelled, whether it was in Europe or in Asia, we respected the fans. We respected the fact that they were turning up, paying money and wanting you to sign and take pictures. You respect that.\"",
      "The future of Marcus Rashford remains uncertain, but United are reportedly unwilling to let him leave on loan amid interest from Barcelona.",
      "Spanish publication Sport has claimed that Barca are not willing to meet United's £40million asking price and would instead be interested in a loan deal. United are said to be \"refusing to negotiate anything other than a permanent transfer.\"",
      "If nothing changes by the final stages of the summer transfer window - after all other options have been explored - the report suggests that United would likely agree to a loan deal at that point.",
      "It's also been reported that Rashford's brother, Dwaine Maynard, held talks with Deco at a hotel in Barcelona.",
      "When quizzed on Rashford and Luis Diaz, Barcelona head coach Hansi Flick said last week: \"Both fantastic players. I like them and we'll see what happens.\"",

      "The Bundesliga club reportedly wants an initial fee of £75million for the 22-year-old, who scored 13 goals last season. Meanwhile, journalist Christian Falk told Caught Offside: \"Man Utd have secret weapon in bid to steal Sesko from Arsenal.",
      "\"There are already talks with Arsenal. From the Premier League, beside Arsenal also Manchester United are particularly interested. [United's director of recruiment] Christopher Vivell was there to watch Sesko at the game in Wolfsburg in mid-April. He once helped discover him and brought the footballer to Salzburg as a 16-year-old in 2019.\"",
      "He previously held roles at Chelsea and RB Leipzig, but it was during his time at RB Salzburg in 2019 that he first signed Sesko, bringing the striker in from Domzale.",
      "FC Barcelona have already started working towards signing new players for next season, but Sporting CP striker Viktor Gyokeres isn't one of them amid links to United.",
      "That's according to Barcelona sporting director, Deco, who chatted about the Catalan giants in an interview with Spanish outlet Sport. Speculation over Gyokeres' future continues to grow, as the Swede has yet to announce his next move or whether he'll simply stay at Sporting.",
      "With his family, national team coach, Sporting CP manager, and teammates all being asked about his future, it was no different for Deco. However, the ex-Portugal regular was quick to shut down any possibility of Barcelona signing Gyokeres.",
      "\"He is a great striker who did excellent things at Sporting but, right now, we are not looking in that position,\" Deco told Sport. \"We have [Robert] Lewandowski at No.9.\"",

      "That is it for our live Manchester United transfer news coverage on Saturday, May 31.",
      "Stay tuned for the latest on Sunday when the transfer window OPENS.",
      "Now then, according to German outlet Kicker (via Mundo Deportivo) have claimed that Erik ten Hag wants to bring Antony to Bayer Leverkusen.",
      "Obviously, Ten Hag brought Antony to United and after arriving in Leverkusen, could bring him to Germany.",
      "Man United are one of the clubs interested in former Chelsea striker Tammy Abraham, according to reports.",
      "Graeme Bailey has reported that they have been approached by the forward's entourage a possible move back to England. Abraham spent this season on loan at AC Milan, scoring 10 goals.",
      "West Ham, Everton and Newcastle have also all shown interest.",
      "Besiktas are 'making a bold' move to attempt to sign Manchester United midfielder Casemiro this summer, according to Fanatik.",
      "Casemiro has a contract at United until summer 2026, meaning he could be available at a cut-price deal. It's added that his market value is estimated to be around £8.4million.",
      "Former United manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, now at Besiktas, is keen to strengthen his squad following an impressive end to the season.",
      "According to A Bola in Portugal, Ruben Amorim has Sporting CP attacking midfielder Pedro Goncalves in his summer plans, with interest expected to increase if Bruno Fernandes is sold.",
      "It's reported that United are considering the Sporting star and weighing up the possibility of moving forward with an offer for Amorim's former player.",
      "Sporting, however, insist that they won't consider offers for Goncalves under his £67million release clause and want to keep him at the club beyond this summer.",
      "Cristiano Ronaldo has told Al-Hilal that they need to sign Manchester United captain Bruno Fernandes if they want him to join ahead of the Club World Cup next month.",
      "Journalist Graeme Bailey told United In Focus: \"Al-Hilal are going for this. Inzaghi, Ronaldo and now the Premier League’s finest. I am told that Ronaldo has told Al-Hilal to get Bruno. There is a real belief within the corridors of power in Saudi football that they can get Bruno.",
      "\"They are offering him wages only Ronaldo and Benzema have surpassed, they really are pushing the boat out. The Pro League's record transfer was €90m for Neymar, they don't often spend huge amounts but they are also willing to pay £100million for Bruno.",
      "\"They didn't get their top target for this summer in the shape of Mo Salah, but Bruno could be the big one.",
      "\"Al Hilal want to win the Club World Cup, and if they can bag Inzaghi, Ronaldo and Bruno... that would be some statement. United have told Bruno he isn't going... but 100m would be a lot to turn down for a player of his age, no matter how important.\"",
      "Manchester United want to sign Brighton & Hove Albion winger Yankuba Minteh and are keen to sign him in a blockbuster summer deal, according to Stretty News.",
      "Minteh has joined Rayan Cherki and Bryan Mbeumo on United's shortlist to strengthen their attack, but it appears that the Brighton man has emerged as a more realistic option.",
      "The 20-year-old Gambian tormented United in Brighton's 3-1 win at Old Trafford in January, scoring one and providing one assist, and that performance has not gone unnoticed.",
      "Manchester United are eager for Antony to depart the club this summer with Real Betis keen to make his loan move permanent but financial constraints pose a significant challenge.",
      "Following Wednesday night's UEFA Conference League final defeat to Chelsea, the La Liga side reportedly cannot meet United's £40million asking price. Antony's hefty weekly wage of £200,000 could also prove problematic, despite the Brazilian's enjoying his time in Seville.",
      "A report in Marca suggests that Betis may consider part-ownership of Antony in an unusual move that would see United retain some interest. Discussions between the clubs are set to take place over the next few days to explore potential agreements.",
      "A more plausible scenario might be for Betis to agree another loan for Antony while covering a substantial portion of his wages. Antony, who cost United £86m, has netted nine goals in 26 matches since joining Betis midway through the season.",
      "Matheus Cunha is still expected to become a Manchester United player, despite the delay surrounding his proposed summer move to Old Trafford, according to Fabrizio Romano.",
      "\"Matheus Cunha to Man Utd is a here we go,\" Romano told his YouTube channel. \"Matheus Cunha to Manchester United is a done deal. But many of you keep asking me where is Matheus Cunha? In the sense that there is no medical, no deal signed, no official statement, no formal steps.",
      "\"My understanding is it's just about waiting for the Visa.",
      "\"So Cunha is waiting for Visa [to be approved] and meanwhile Man Utd are preparing everything for the medical and contract signing, then for the sure the formal steps will be coordinated with the Brazilian national team staff because then Cunha will join the Brazilian national team with Carlo Ancelotti (on international duty).",
      "\"So [Man Utd] are working on the location [for the medical], working on every single step including the Visa, but Matheus Cunha will be a Manchester United player, don't worry about that.\"",
      "Victor Osimhen and Viktor Gyokeres are two of Europe's most in-demand strikers right now and Manchester United continue to be linked with both.",
      "United are in desperate need of a reliable goal-scorer this summer, having not had one since Marcus Rashford netted 30 goals in 2022/2023 under Erik ten Hag. Cristiano Ronaldo was United's last great striker in that regard with 24 goals in 2021/2022.",
      "It's why Osimhen and Gyokeres are so, so appealing. There's a sense that signing either player would fix a huge number of problems at M16 and perhaps the biggest one of them all.",
      "Read the full piece here",
      "Manchester United are reportedly interested in Sporting CP star Pedro Goncalves as a potential replacement for Bruno Fernandes this summer.",
      "It is claimed that Old Trafford chiefs are relaxed about Fernandes' situation. The club are prepared to listen to offers for any squad member after they finished 15th in the Premier League, their worst top-flight finish since relegation in 1974.",
      "Read more here",
      "Marcus Rashford could potentially provide Manchester United with a parting gift by securing a transfer to Barcelona ahead of next season.",
      "Despite being contracted to the Reds until 2028, the forward's future at Old Trafford appears uncertain. Rashford is widely anticipated to depart this summer and is reportedly attracting considerable interest.",
      "Several European clubs have been linked with a move for the United academy graduate, who spent the latter half of the season on loan at Aston Villa. However, it has been claimed that he has turned down all transfer offers in favour of a move to Barcelona.",
      "Read more here",
      "United are second-favourites to sign Ollie Watkins this summer, according to the bookmakers Betfair.",
      "Aston Villa boss Unai Emery has at times used Marcus Rashford up front in place of Watkins, but he has still managed to score 16 league goals this season.",
      "However, Villa were dealt a PSR blow after missing out on the Champions League and they may now have to sell some of their stars to comply with the league's financial rules.",
      "Betfair: Ollie Watkins to sign for before 2nd September 2025",
      "Arsenal 6/4Man Utd 9/2Newcastle 15/2Chelsea, Liverpool 17/2",
      "Ex-Manchester United man Gordon Strachan struggles to see how Matheus Cunha would fit into Ruben Amorim's current system at Old Trafford and beyond.",
      "United have identified Cunha as a primary target this summer, as they look to improve their attack under Amorim. Cunha's notable tally of 15 Premier League goals in just 31 outings during the 2024/2025 season has also reportedly caught the eye of Arsenal, who are keen on enhancing their forward options.",
      "Read more here",
      "Bruno Fernandes has a huge decision to make which could change Manchester United's future under Ruben Amorim.",
      "What happens next will be pivotal to United's 2025/26 campaign - a season where the Reds' status as one of Europe's leading clubs is under threat. That's not to say they won't remain a big club, but after finishing so low in the top-flight, teams like Newcastle and Chelsea, never mind Liverpool, Arsenal and Manchester City, are becoming more fashionable to support for younger fans across the globe.",
      "It's why selling Fernandes is such a bad idea after the season United have had. Imagine where they would have been without him? It's not a stretch to suggest that they could have been looking over their shoulders at the Premier League's bottom three.",
      "Read the full piece here",
      "Portuguese publication A Bola are claiming that United are ‘considering making an offer’ for Pedro Goncalves. It is said that the possibility will only increase if Bruno Fernandes is sold.",
      "The forward played as a left-sided No.10 under current Reds boss Ruben Amorim at Sporting. Goncalves scored 81 goals and provided 57 assists across 190 games under Amorim.",
      "Sporting’s position is reportedly that he can only leave if his €80m (£67m) release clause is triggered. It is said that the Portuguese champions want to renew his contract, but they will wait to see if there could be any movements in the upcoming summer transfer window.",
      "Real Betis have opened negotiations to secure a permanent deal for Antony this summer.",
      "Spanish outlet Marca have claimed that a meeting has been scheduled for next week between Betis and United to 'assess various scenarios'.",
      "Extending his loan for another year is an option but it's claimed that United want to sell Antony permanently.",
      "Man United will turn their attention to Sporting CP playmaker Pedro Goncalves of Bruno Fernandes secures a move to Saudi Arabia.",
      "Portuguese outlet A Bola have claimed that United have identified the former Wolves star as a replacement for Fernandes. The report claims that United are considering an appaorach for Goncalves.",
      "Goncalves is said to have a good relationship with Ruben Amorim.",
      "Barcelona have identified Arsenal's Gabriel Martinelli as an alternative to Marcus Rashford, should they not secure a deal with Manchester United.",
      "Spanish outlet Sport has claimed that Barca's 'plan is to try a loan' for Rashford with them deeming €40m too much to pay for him. It's claimed that, if they were to spend money, they would look at Luis Diaz.",
      "Martinelli and Kingsley Coman are two players they could look to sign permanently over Rashford.",
      "A different one here.",
      "According to Football Transfers, Man United have expressed an interest in Chelsea striker Nicolas Jackson. It comes after they missed out on Liam Delap, who is joining Chelsea.",
      "Jackson has scored 24 Premier League goals in the past two seasons.",

      "According to The Athletic, Delap will undergo his medical on Monday ahead of a potential move to Chelsea.",
      "The report claims Chelsea met the £30m release clause in the striker's contract. This was activated following Ipswich Town's relegation to the Championship.",
      "Despite attracting interest from the likes of Man United, AC Milan and Juventus - Delap has informed the Blues over his preference to move to west London.",
      "Chido Obi put in an impressive display for Man United in their post-season fixture against Hong Kong.",
      "The young striker scored twice as United claimed a 3-1 victory at the Hong Kong Stadium. Ayden Heaven was also on the score-sheet after Jorginho put the hosts in front, as United made a second-half comeback with three goals.",
      "Obi currently wears the No.56 shirt for United, which is the same number which was handed to him when he first arrived at Old Trafford and featured for the first-team. This summer could be the time that United put their faith in the striker and give him a new number for the upcoming season.",
      "Several numbers are set to be available to new signings this summer - as well as for current members of the squad who are deserving of an upgrade. If United do decide to give Obi a new number there are several options available. The No.19 is currently vacant at United, having previously been worn by Raphael Varane until his departure in the summer of 2024. No.14 is also set to be available once Christian Eriksen leaves as a free agent.",
      "No.10 is currently worn by Marcus Rashford, No.12 by Tyrell Malacia and No.21 by Antony, with all three men facing uncertain futures going into the summer. United also have every number from 27 up to 36 available, to either new signings or for in-house upgrades."

      "Unlike last summer, Garnacho looks set to leave Old Trafford with the growing need to comply with Profit and Sustainability Rules (PSR). In January, Napoli’s attempt to add him to Antonio Conte’s squad fell through, while Chelsea’s interest failed to materialise into a move.",
      "Garnacho was left out of the Manchester derby in December due to concerns over his attitude. In February, he walked straight down the tunnel after being substituted in the first half against Ipswich Town.",
      "That incident was followed by his public criticism of Ruben Amorim’s team selection and his description of the campaign as a 's**t' season after the Europa League final defeat to Tottenham in May.",
      "\"It was noticeable in Hong Kong how carefully some of United's staff shadowed Garnacho as he signed shirts and posed for pictures, never breaking into a smile. Garnacho was one of the last to board the team bus after the All Stars defeat. With midnight looming, he donned sunglasses and ignored requests in the mixed zone.",
      "\"An eyewitness said he removed the shades almost immediately after he walked past the packed pen and surmised they were donned at the behest of personal sponsors. It still projected a brattish attitude. Beyond some of the imagery that has emerged on social media, Garnacho also stuck his middle finger up at one of the United photographers after the All Stars match.\"",
      "Read more here.",
      "Garnacho made his feelings clear following United's post-season tour in South East Asia.",
      "In an Instagram story on Saturday evening, the Argentine, who has been the subject of increased transfer speculation, posted a picture of him on an airplane with the caption: \"Finally,\" alongside a loudly crying face emoji, a folded hands emoji and a desert island emoji.",
      "Since Garnacho wasn’t named in Argentina’s squad for the upcoming World Cup qualifiers against Chile and Colombia, he is expected to take a holiday and enjoy his summer break.",
      "The 20-year-old featured in the 1-0 defeat to the ASEAN All-Stars and started in the 3-1 victory over Hong Kong.",
      "The Reds head coach says the situation with Garnacho is 'okay' despite telling the winger he is free to leave the club.",
      "\"It’s not a surprise,\" Amorim said of Garnacho's presence in Asia.",
      "\"He’s a player of Manchester United, all the players are here. Some players are injured and it was better not to fly here to play these two games so it’s a normal situation. It’s okay.\"",
      "\"Obviously it’s hard for everyone,\" said Garnacho after the 1-0 defeat in the Europa League final last month. \"Our season was s***. We didn’t beat anyone in the league.",
      "\"We lacked a lot of things. When you don’t score goals, you always need more. Until we reached the final, I played every round. And I played 20 minutes today - I don’t know. I’m going to try to enjoy the summer and see what happens next.\"",
      "Speaking about the club's current situation, the Reds icon Beckham, told CBS Sports: \"It’s tough times. I don’t like seeing some of the things that are going on at the club. On the pitch is what counts but in all honesty I’m seeing a lot of things that are not ok in my eyes as a fan and as a lover of Man United.",
      "\"You have to represent the badge. That’s what it is about. I’ve seen a lot of things where players are not acting in the right manner. We were a part of a team that was so well-mannered. We understood what it meant to play for Manchester United. We understood what the badge meant.",
      "\"Wherever we travelled, whether it was in Europe or in Asia, we respected the fans. We respected the fact that they were turning up, paying money and wanting you to sign and take pictures. You respect that.\"",
      "The Argentina international will certainly not be short of potential suitors. With an estimated value between £60-£70million, several clubs are interested in rescuing him from his Old Trafford woes.",
      "Here, we take a look at the potential clubs that could be interested in Garnacho's services.",
      "The youngster is seemingly moving towards the exit door at Old Trafford. Garnacho travelled on the post-season tour of Asia but cut a surly figure and an exit now seems inevitable.",
      "Napoli were heavily linked in January while Chelsea have also been credited with an interest. He will surely have other suitors too and United could sanction a move for around £40million.",
      "That would represent pure profit on the club accounts and offer an opportunity for reinvestment into the squad.",
      "With that in mind here's three possible replacements for Garnacho."

      "Ruben Amorim is now just hours away from embarking on his first summer transfer window as Manchester United head coach.",
      "The window will initially open on Sunday before briefly closing again on Tuesday, June 10. The window is opening earlier than usual due to an exceptional registration period relating to the FIFA Club World Cup taking place this summer.",
      "The window will then reopen on Monday, June 16 until the 7pm deadline on Monday, September 1, meaning clubs will have plenty of time to get deals over the line and their squads in order for the 2025/26 campaign.",
      "For United, a summer transfer window has never felt so important. The club experienced its worst campaign in 51 years this season and much-needed changes are required across the board.",
      "However, as a result of missing out on European qualification for next term, United will not be able to make as many alterations as they would have been able to had they made it into the Champions League. Amorim admitted this week United \"cannot do much\".",
      "It means player sales, which could include the departures of Alejandro Garnacho and Bruno Fernandes, could dictate what United are capable of. They want to strengthen their attack as a priority and are already well on their way to doing so.",
      "Barring any late hiccups, Wolves star Matheus Cunha will become their first signing of the summer. United remain in talks with the Midlands outfit over how to structure the payment of his £62.5million release clause.",
      "If and when United get that deal over the line, he is expected to slot straight into Amorim's first-choice XI and occupy the left-sided No.10 spot. He is well-versed playing that role in a three-at-the-back formation.",
      "United had also earmarked Ipswich Town ace Liam Delap as their priority target to strengthen the No.9 position. United desperately need a striker this summer and Delap was an attainable option at £30m.",
      "However, he is now on the cusp of joining Chelsea, meaning United's search for a striker is going to have to lead them elsewhere.",
      "Despite scoring 12 goals for a relegated side this season, Delap is still raw and unproven. United, instead, need a more established figure that can offer a greater guarantee of goals.",
      "Napoli's Victor Osimhen would be the ideal option for United. Napoli are keen to offload him as quickly as possible this summer after his loan spell at Galatasaray, which saw him score 36 goals, and he has a proven record of scoring goals just about everywhere he has been.",
      "Of course, the elephant in the room is that United cannot offer any prospective signings European football for next season. Osimhen would be a guaranteed starter and the prospect of achieving his dream of playing in the Premier League could convince him to make the move.",
      "Brentford ace Bryan Mbeumo has also been linked with United over the past week or so and he would be another statement signing. He scored 20 Premier League goals this season and is going to command plenty of interest this summer.",
      "He would be a perfect fit for United's front-three, operating as the right-sided No.10. He also has the versatility that Amorim wants in his players.",
      "With strengthening the attack having to take priority this summer, the rest of United's squad may largely remain unchanged. Player sales, as already documented, will dictate what is available.",
      "There are cases for United to strengthen in the centre of midfield and in goal. However, United are reasonably well-stocked in other areas, meaning recruitment in lesser priority positions may have to wait beyond this summer.",
      "But if Fernandes is sold for the mooted £100m fee that Al-Hilal are reportedly ready to pay, more could be achievable. United, though, should be attempting to keep the Portuguese international amid his importance to the team.",
      "Starting XI: Onana; Yoro, Maguire, Heaven; Amad, Ugarte, Fernandes, Dorgu; Mbeumo, Cunha; Osimhen.",
      "Substitutes: Bayindir, Mazraoui, De Ligt, Martinez, Dalot, Mainoo, Mount, Zirkzee, Obi."

      "When Manchester United players got wind that a post-season tour was a certainty, a delegation on behalf of the first team squad approached the football leadership team to express their dismay.",
      "One senior player complained that his family holiday, booked for the half-term week after the season ended, would have to be cancelled. Another suggested that players would try to cry off and avoid a 14,150-mile round trip to Malaysia and Hong Kong.",
      "In response to that warning, United brought the departure time of their outbound flight forward to Sunday evening, hours after the final game of the season against Aston Villa. That reduced the possibility of any last-minute withdrawals. Injured trio Matthijs de Ligt, Joshua Zirkzee and Luke Shaw all boarded the plane to Kuala Lumpur.",
      "Shaw's parents, partner and children boarded a plane for Dubai that night. Jonny Evans's wife, Helen, children and extended family were on the same flight. The WAGs' spouses might have wished they could join them.",
      "Victor Lindelof and Christian Eriksen are both leaving United and were absent from the tour, with personal reasons cited. Lindelof's wife, Maja, is due to give birth to their third child and Eriksen is about to get married to his long-time partner Sabrina Kvist Jensen.",
      "Well-placed sources have said the United players were \"fuming\" to be in Asia after a 60-game season. They are unlikely to generate any sympathy after a trophyless campaign and 15th-placed finish. United did get to lift a cup in Hong Kong, one so undervalued a press officer carried it back to the dressing room.",
      "Some United sources assured the mood was better than expected after last week's demoralising Europa League final defeat to Tottenham Hotspur. Every player conducted the obligatory post-match meet-and-greets in the Hong Kong National Stadium on Friday evening, including a moody Alejandro Garnacho, this time minus his sunglasses.",
      "United's six days away from home Manchester were effectively condensed into four. Tuesday was teeming with commercial player appearances, with some lasting two hours. Players gladhanded guests on behalf of club sponsors Adidas, Tezos and Snapdragon, among others.",
      "Wednesday marked the now infamous Maybank-sponsored open-top bus journey that Zirkzee, De Ligt and Ayden Heaven were on board for. A United source insists it was not arranged with the intention of parading the Europa League trophy around Kuala Lumpur and that it was billed as a bus tour.",
      "In United's view, this was an example of the distinction between engagement with local fans and overseas fans. The bus ride was lapped up by locals. Back home, it was a source of embarrassment for those still reeling from the Bilbao blow.",
      "Adidas hosted a poolside party on the deck of the W Hotel after the defeat to the ASEAN All Stars on Wednesday evening. Several guests attended the nocturnal gathering and admired the sight of the glistening Petronas Twin Towers in the background.",
      "There was more commercial activity on Friday ahead of the second friendly with a Hong Kong XI. United held more meet-and-greets following their arrival in Hong Kong on Thursday, with a minor training session held in the rain. Mason Mount and Altay Bayindir featured after their non-appearances in Malaysia.",
      "Three of their teammates were in India. Andre Onana, Harry Maguire and Diogo Dalot left the Bukit Jalil National Stadium at half-time on Wednesday to board a private jet to Mumbai. Despite intense commercial activities planned, the trio were happy to volunteer as they got to return home earlier.",
      "After United were beaten by the ASEAN All Stars, there was gallows humour on the team bus back to the W Hotel. The booing at the Bukit Jalil National Stadium had not gone unnoticed by players and staff. Ruben Amorim reminded the media in Hong Kong there had been loud cheering, too.",
      "There were some farcical post-match scenes in Kuala Lumpur. United had to collect silver medals for the second Wednesday running, but the procession was delayed. The referee and linesmen had returned to their dressing room but had to be called back out to receive their medals, so United were forced to endure an inordinate wait.",
      "A United player half-joked the post-season tour would be \"like a stag do\". Some players were tempted to venture out beyond the house arrest of the team hotel but were advised by a senior player to stay in.",
      "United staff let their hair down on the trip. Some enjoyed drinks on the 14-hour flight to Kuala Lumpur while players had permission to head out into Kuala Lumpur on their first night in the Malaysian capital, flanked by security. A source said nothing \"crazy\" happened.",
      "Sources say the players returned at a reasonable time. United did not bother adjusting to the seven-hour time zone difference as training and commercial obligations were always held in the afternoons and evenings.",
      "Club sources acknowledged the trip was not as disciplined as a pre-season tour and that players could be more frivolous. Garnacho, Amad and Heaven headed out on e-scooters that had to be paid for by clued-up locals. Zirkzee was not taken by the room service on offer at the W Hotel in Kuala Lumpur, so headed across the road for some Thai take-out, again accompanied by a security guard.",
      "On the eighth floor of United's hotel in Kuala Lumpur there was a vending machine that dispensed mini bottles of Moet & Chandon champagne, priced at £40. If any United representative was of that persuasion it would have been to drown their sorrows after a shocking season.",
      "Happy faces were put on for signing sessions yet United players still made headlines with some explicit gestures. Amad raised his middle finger to fans he claimed were abusing his mother. Garnacho has done it multiple times without provocation. The players were advised to stop making the offensive gesture.",
      "Those on the tour have found Garnacho to be surly. He promised the All Stars forward Sergio Aguero that he would give him his shirt after the game. Instead, Garnacho blanked Aguero and United staff had to arrange for a shirt to be gifted to the Malaysian as a memento. It was noticeable in Hong Kong how carefully some of United's staff shadowed Garnacho as he signed shirts and posed for pictures, never breaking into a smile.",
      "Garnacho was one of the last to board the team bus after the All Stars defeat. With midnight looming, he donned sunglasses and ignored requests in the mixed zone. An eyewitness said he removed the shades almost immediately after he walked past the packed pen and surmised they were donned at the behest of personal sponsors. It still projected a brattish attitude.",
      "Beyond some of the imagery that has emerged on social media, Garnacho also stuck his middle finger up at one of the United photographers after the All Stars match. Amorim started to chuckle when the remote possibility of Garnacho staying was raised at a press conference in Hong Kong on Thursday.",
      "Amorim cheerfully admitted to a colleague how exhausting the post-season tour had been, especially in the humidity of Malaysia. The Portuguese will oversee his first pre-season tour with United in July, a condensed and relatively low-key return to the United States, spent primarily in Chicago.",
      "The prestige of the United manager's role has dawned on him. \"It's more than a coach,\" Amorim admitted. \"On this tour, I had a small meeting with the Prime Minister of Malaysia.",
      "\"You have to improve as a person, as a leader, you have to control the momentum. Sometimes after games you see I'm really frustrated, I'm trying to control that. The only thing I want is to improve the team and have results, when you have results you can manage the team so much easier.\"",
      "It would be easier if Bruno Fernandes stayed but the United captain is giving serious consideration to an approach from Saudi Pro League side Al Hilal. Figures at United empathise with Fernandes, who has not shied from the subject with confidants. They would not blame him if he were to up sticks after five-and-a-half years of underachievement with United. Fernandes has not formally told United he wants to leave.",
      "There is understandable concern at the prospect of United minus Fernandes. His leadership has been apparent even over the past few days in Asia, where he bought staff drinks at the hotel bar and was generous with post-match autograph requests from Malaysian fans who had crammed into the mixed zone. It was the same in Hong Kong. Fernandes was ushered to the team coach by three secruity guards.",
      "United's stay in Hong Kong was so whistlestop that they were barely in the country for 36 hours. After an early-morning flight, the team spent around an hour at their second W Hotel to freshen up and have lunch. Then it was back on the bus to the Hong Kong Stadium for training and more meet-and-greets.",
      "With ample time to reflect on their worst season in 51 years, some within the United camp are already at the end of their tether with many in the squad. The widespread consensus is that the players do not play to their maximum in every match, as evidenced by the contrast in their Europa League and Premier League form.",
      "During the open training session in Kuala Lumpur, United's back-to-front attacks were constructed at a glacial pace. One of the inflatable mannequins quickly deflated.",
      "That is how the players would feel if they have to embark on another post-season trek."

      "The 26-year-old has been cited as a transformational-type figure who can help alter a club's fortunes - a factor United so desperately need coming off their back of a dismal Premier League season and defeat in the Europa League final.",
      "Barring any last minute snags, the Wolves star is expected to become Ruben Amorim's first signing of the summer. United remain in talks with the Midlands side over how to structure the payment of his £62.5million release clause.",
      "Should United get that deal over the line, he is expected to slot straight into Amorim's first-choice XI and occupy the left-sided No. 10 spot. Cunha has demonstrated more than just tactical flexibility however.",
      "The Brazilian joined Bundesliga side Hertha Berlin in January 2020 and within two seasons in the German capital he became something of a hero to locals. He was even lauded as the reason the team staved off relegation, according to Hertha writer Marc Schwitzky.",
      "“Cunha played his way into the hearts of the Berliners,” Schwitzky told The Athletic in January 2023. “He came in January 2020 when the team was completely down and was possibly the main factor in them not being relegated.",
      "“Normally, it is a problem when a team has no offensive flow, but for Cunha, exactly this freedom was perfect, he blossomed completely.",
      "“Many games of the second half of 2020-21 became a Cunha show. Again and again he led the way with spectacular scenes, he didn’t seem to care about all the pressure of relegation, he was just happy to be able to play so much.",
      "“He also started the 2021-22 season fantastically, in the first 10 games he was directly involved in nine goals. But then he fell into a dip in form that he couldn’t get out of.”",
      "Cunha’s slight dip in form brought clashes with then Hertha coach Bruno Labaddia over what was perceived as a lack of tactical discipline. And discipline is a word that has frequently come up in Cunha's colourful career.",
      "On the flip-side to his more valiant attributes, concerns over the player's ability to keep a cool head have been raised. While Cunha bagged 17 goals and six assists in all competitions for Wolves this season he also grappled with behavioural issues.",
      "The 26-year-old was handed a two-game ban in December after appearing to elbow an Ipswich Town staff member before removing the same staffer's glasses. In March, he was also suspended for four games after headbutting Bournemouth's Milos Kerkez and being escorted down the tunnel during an FA Cup tie.",
      "Ex-England striker Gary Lineker is just one who has fired a warning to United, claiming that Cunha might suffer from \"lacking team principles and work ethic\".",
      "\"He's an incredibly talented player. There's a slight question mark against Matheus Cunha in terms of managers,\" Lineker said on the Rest is Football podcast recently. \"He's either brilliant or he can be accused occasionally of lacking team principles and work ethic.\""

      "The 20-year-old, once seen as a potential successor to Cristiano Ronaldo, fell further out of favour after labelling United's season \"s***\" and calling out his lack of playing time following the Europa League final loss to Tottenham. With an estimated value between £60-£70million, several clubs are interested in rescuing him from his Old Trafford woes.",
      "Among the interested parties are Napoli, who, after having a £40m offer turned down in January, stand as the front-runners to snap up the young talent. Garnacho could fill the void left by Khvicha Kvaratskhelia's winter move to PSG from the newly-crowned Serie A champions.",
      "He certainly has the potential to secure a starting spot in Antonio Conte's starting XI, with his former team-mate Scott McTominay transforming into a club icon due to his goalscoring heroics within just one season in Naples.",
      "The i has claimed Napoli's sporting director Giovanni Manna intends to rekindle negotiations with United representatives concerning the Argentine winger, though reaching a consensus on the fee could be easier said than done.",
      "Given their recent transfer record, it seems Chelsea could fork out the necessary funds more readily. Todd Boehly hasn't hesitated to flash the cash for the past three years, and this summer appears no different.",

      "Still, questions linger over Jadon Sancho's future, creating a possible opening. With Noni Madueke and Pedro Neto fitting more comfortably on the right wing, there's potentially a position waiting for Garnacho..",
      "Meanwhile, Atletico might see his return as a viable move, as he's already spent half a decade in their youth setup before chasing his \"dream\" when joining United in 2020.",

      "At the San Siro, he could enjoy more attacking freedom than in Madrid. Both Inter and AC have been linked with a move, but if Rafael Leao departs, the latter could be in pole position.",
      "Leao has been linked with numerous clubs, including United. A swap deal could be on the cards depending on if Garnacho is interested.",
      "Milan have been mentioned in Italian reports as one of the early negotiators alongside Napoli. However, their lack of European football next season puts them at a disadvantage.",
      "The appointment of Ten Hag at the BayArena has naturally led to speculation of a reunion for Garnacho in Germany. Leverkusen will certainly not be short of funds this summer.",

      "As the Premier League season draws to a close, clubs are already strategising for the summer transfer window.",
      "Among the many unfolding narratives, the situation surrounding Marcus Rashford is drawing significant attention. The 27-year-old spent the latter half of the season on loan at Aston Villa after being sidelined at Manchester United by Ruben Amorim.",
      "The United academy product made a positive impact at Villa Park, netting four goals and providing six assists across all competitions, earning him a recall to the England squad. Rashford's future remains uncertain, but with Amorim showing no signs of altering his position, it seems likely that the Old Trafford exit will be left ajar for Rashford.",
      "In 17 appearances and 10 starts across all competitions for Villa, Rashford scored four goals and provided six assists. He made several crucial contributions, including a pair of assists in Villa's 2-1 triumph over Chelsea. He also put in an impressive performance against Paris Saint-Germain, where Villa came tantalisingly close to overturning a 3-1 aggregate deficit in the Champions League quarter-final.",
      "Under Unai Emery's management, Rashford appeared sharp, eager, focused and clinical. Villa narrowly missed out on Champions League qualification, but Emery is a fan of the Europa League and would want a squad capable of competing both in Europe and domestically.",
      "However, with Villa already having the sixth-highest wage bill in the Premier League, they may struggle to accommodate Rashford's reported £325,000-a-week salary from United. From a footballing perspective, it seems a good match, but with a £40million buy option on top of a hefty wage, the financial implications might be too much for Villa.",
      "Despite a disappointing Premier League campaign, Tottenham's Europa League final victory over United earned them a spot in the Champions League. The north London team's 17th-place finish in the Premier League was one of the worst in their club history, but it's easy to overlook the significant number of injuries Spurs had to deal with.",
      "In addition to losing key players like James Maddison, Dejan Kulusevski and Dominic Solanke to injury, captain and star player Son Heung-min also had a difficult season. His tally of seven goals in 30 Premier League appearances was his lowest since his debut season in 2015/16, when he scored just four goals in 28 appearances.",
      "With the South Korean's goal-scoring prowess waning this season, another forward with speed, directness and a clinical edge could be on Ange Postecoglou's wish list. Rashford could be the ideal signing for the Tottenham manager, given his extensive Champions League experience. Should Spurs secure a favourable deal with United, who may need to offload players after missing out on Champions League qualification revenue, Rashford seems a great fit.",
      "Speculation has been rife about Rashford's aspiration to play at the Nou Camp one day, with reports from Mundo Deportivo stating that Rashford's agents have informed Barcelona he'd be open to reducing his salary to secure a move to the Catalan club.",
      "What's more, Barcelona manager Hansi Flick recently acknowledged his admiration for both Liverpool's Luis Diaz and Rashford, saying: \"I don't want to speak about players, which are not in my team, but of course Luis Diaz and Marcus Rashford are fantastic players. I like them and we'll see what happens.\"",
      "With Barcelona once again a dominant force in Europe, winning La Liga and advancing to the Champions League semi-finals, Rashford would undoubtedly have to compete for a spot against formidable attacking talent like Raphinha, Robert Lewandowski and Lamine Yamal, along with support from Dani Olmo and Ferran Torres.",
      "Barcelona might be an appealing prospect for Rashford, but he'd have to go above and beyond to secure a starting spot amid the club's elite.",

      "Conte's transformative coaching has also benefited another former Red Devil, Romelu Lukaku, who led the line for the Neapolitans. While Napoli has shown past interest in Alejandro Garnacho, Rashford's proven abilities might tilt Conte's favour towards him.",
      "However, whispers persist over Conte's own future after Napoli president Aurelio De Laurentiis' remarks following their title celebrations suggested the manager might move on. At a trophy parade, he told fans: \"I wish Conte continuing success in his professional life. Thank you, Antonio.\"",
      "Rashford has seen fellow Englishmen Tammy Abraham, Fikayo Tomori and Ruben Loftus-Cheek thrive at AC Milan, and a spot could soon become available at the Rossoneri, with left-winger Rafael Leao's future at the San Siro currently uncertain.",
      "Milan had a challenging season this year, finishing in a disappointing eighth place. The European giants, who clinched Serie A in 2022, may need fresh energy and a new mindset - Rashford could be the one to ignite that spark.",
      "However, their absence from European football next season might mean a move doesn't come to fruition, considering the necessary funds involved."

      "£100million in the bank or Bruno Fernandes in the team? That is question Manchester United might already be asking themselves.",
      "The playmaker's agent, Miguel Pinho, has held talks with Al-Hilal and a £100m transfer has been mooted. The Saudi club want to try and get on with a deal quickly in order to get Fernandes signed in time for the upcoming Club World Cup.",
      "Although Fernandes is thinking about quitting Old Trafford for the Saudi Pro League, United head coach Ruben Amorim is confident he will stay in Manchester.",
      "Asked if he thinks Fernandes will leave, Amorim, speaking after his side's 3-1 win over Hong Kong on Friday, said: \"I don't think so. I don't know for sure, but nobody knows. But I don't think so.",
      "\"He is seeing us changing some actions to change all the things and I think he wants to stay. He is saying no to a lot of things. But he shows that he wants to win.",
      "\"He is really hungry. He is really good. He needs to be in the best league in the world.\"",
      "Fernandes was a beacon of light in a forgettable season for United this term, scoring 19 goals and racking up 20 assists. Without him, relegation to the Championship might have been a genuine threat.",
      "He has carried United for much of the last few seasons and he is a central pillar to Amorim's plans, meaning it is easy to understand why his fellow countryman is determined to keep him.",
      "United need to make much-needed changes to the landscape of their squad this summer, but losing a player of Fernandes' quality and importance risks putting them on the back foot. Other players are expected to depart Old Trafford this summer amid the club's need for cash, such as Alejandro Garnacho, Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho and Antony. None of them come close to matching Fernandes' importance.",
      "Amid Fernandes' importance, United, if Omar Berrada's comments about recruitment earlier this year are anything to go by, will not be prepared to let the Portuguese international go anywhere. That is because the United chief executive insisted players will only be sold if it is of benefit to the squad and not purely for financial reasons.",
      "\"So just because we'll have more revenues to invest if we're in the Champions League, it doesn't mean we're going to go and over-invest,\" he said back in March.",
      "\"We need to be cautious and, and we need to try to make as many good decisions as we can in recruitment. And also when it comes to sales, we will do it purely on the basis of whether it helps improve the team or not, not for financial reasons.\"",
      "Selling Fernandes, regardless of the price, would not help the team. The 30-year-old is a world-class player and has been United's best signing of the post-Sir Alex Ferguson era by a country mile.",
      "Few players in the Premier League have been as consistent as Fernandes has since he arrived in England in 2020, and his efforts have been worthy of much more than just the two trophies he has won during his United career.",
      "Of course, speculation that Al-Hilal could table a £100m offer for him could turn the dial for United and back them into a corner, putting them under immense pressure to sell. They must also consider he will turn 31 in September.",
      "But if Berrada is to stay true to his word, no offer will be enough to convince United to sell their talisman this summer."

      "Bruno Fernandes is facing a pivotal moment in his career as he considers a lucrative move to Saudi Arabian club Al-Hilal. The Manchester United skipper must choose between staying loyal to his current side or accepting a mega-money offer following a disappointing season with the Reds, which saw them place 15th in the Premier League and lose the Europa League final.",
      "After a disheartening post-season tour in Malaysia and Hong Kong, Fernandes has been presented with the chance to join Al-Hilal, with the club said to be ready to cough up £100million for his transfer, and another £100million for his wages throughout his contract. His representative, Miguel Pinho, has spent time in Riyadh negotiating with Al-Hilal's top brass and Fernandes reportedly has one week to decide, as the Saudi team gears up for the Club World Cup.",
      "In the midst of this uncertainty, Fernandes added fuel to the fire by posting a cryptic message in Portuguese on Instagram, saying: \"If you tried and failed, congratulations! There are people who don't even try.\"",
      "With a deal at Old Trafford that runs till June 2027, and the option for an additional year, the decision-making moment is fast approaching for the 30 year old. Since arriving from Sporting Lisbon in January 2020, Fernandes has tallied 98 goals and 87 assists across 290 matches for United and has worn the captain's armband for two terms.",
      "Al-Hilal's interest in acquiring his services isn't new, but United's poor form and the need to refresh their squad makes a move a real possibility. Regardless of his decision – whether to stay with United or transfer to Saudi Arabia – it now seems unlikely that Fernandes will fulfil his previously expressed desire to play in Brazil, reports the Mirror.",
      "He'll be turning 31 this September, and his decision this summer seems to rule out any future move to a Brazilian team. \"Whenever I can, I follow it, because I find Brazilian football attractive, electric football, with a lot of quality, joy, very one-on-one,\" he has said in the past.",
      "\"It's pure football. And I think that now, with the coaches that are there, not only the Portuguese, but also Brazilians, are increasingly developing in the tactical part.",
      "\"I don't really like talking about the distant future, but it's like I said. It's attractive football, very interesting. The only thing is that the trips are very long there in Brazil! There are many competitions, many clubs that play Libertadores and Sudamericana, very good competitions. I'm not saying no, because Brazilian football is very attractive, and we never know the future.\"",
      "The contract purportedly up for grabs at Al-Hilal is worth an astonishing £700,000 per week and would last for three years. By the end of that period, he will be nearing 34 and may opt to return to his homeland Portugal, rather than relocating to South America, away from his extended family."

      "Never has a summer transfer window felt so important for Manchester United.",
      "After experiencing their worst season in 51 years, United are about embark on a period in which as many changes need to be made as realistically possible. The window will open on Sunday for 10 days before closing again on June 10.",
      "It will then reopen again on June 16 and stay open until the final klaxon sounds on September 1. Just how United's squad will look come then is anyone's guess.",
      "After losing last week's Europa League final in Bilbao, United will not be able to oversee the volume of changes they would have liked had they qualified for the Champions League. Head coach Ruben Amorim has already admitted they \"cannot do much\" this summer.",
      "Nevertheless, there are some decisions that will have to be made. With that said, here are United's leading priorities for this summer:",
      "Missing out on Liam Delap's signature is not necessarily as big a 'blow' as some United fans might fear. The 22-year-old, who is set to join Chelsea, has spent just one season as a Premier League regular, scoring 12 goals in an Ipswich Town side that won just four league games all season.",
      "As respectable as his tally was, the difference in expectations between Ipswich and United are worlds apart. The pressure at United is ten-fold in comparison.",
      "United, this summer, should be making the addition of a proven and established goalscorer their top priority. They have finished the last two Premier League seasons with a negative goal difference and that is unacceptable.",
      "United need someone who can come in, hit the ground running and score goals at a consistent rate. Strikers of that ilk are not cheap, but United, at this juncture, cannot afford to go another season without a reliable goalscorer leading their attack.",
      "News of Bruno Fernandes considering his future at Old Trafford amid interest from Saudi Arabian side Al-Hilal could leave United with a massive decision to make. A bid worth £100million is being mooted and the prospect of that officially being put to United could test their resolve.",
      "A bid of such strength could convince United to cash-in on a player who will turn 31 in September. On the flip side, they may believe his importance to the team is just too great.",
      "United would have been worse off without him this season, highlighted by his return of 19 goals and 20 assists across all competitions, meaning that thought must be considered in their thinking. He is their jewel in a broken crown and losing him could damage it even further.",
      "Player sales will dictate exactly what is achievable for United this summer in terms of incomings. Jonny Evans, Victor Lindelof and Christian Eriksen will set the ball rolling when their contracts expire and more departures will follow.",
      "United have already informed Garnacho he will be sold if a suitable offer comes along, while Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho and Antony have been identified as priority sales. The trio all spent time out on loan this season.",
      "Elsewhere, United should be aiming to try and offload Altay Bayindir, Luke Shaw, Tyrell Malacia, and Casemiro. Shifting them, however, is much easier said than done.",
      "But if United are serious about revamping the squad to the best of their ability, they need to point those who do not have long-term futures at the club in the direction of the exit.",
      "Bayindir has not covered himself in glory when he has donned the gloves, and he should be sold, meaning United must recruit an improved backup goalkeeper to challenge Onana at the very least.",
      "You can also make an argument for United attempting to sign a new No.1. Onana has made too many costly errors since succeeding David de Gea and can no longer be assured of automatically being the starting goalkeeper by default.",
      "In back-to-back summers, United gambled a combined £108.5m on two players they thought would strengthen their attack. Rasmus Hojlund arrived for a fee that could rise to £72m from Atalanta in August 2023 and Joshua Zirkzee arrived from Bologna 11 months later.",
      "Neither of them have shown anywhere enough to suggest they can lead United's attack, with Hojlund regressing this season and Zirkzee soon making it clear he is not a No.9.",
      "If United sell either/both of them this summer, they will have to accept losses on the pair. Their current valuations are nowhere near the fees United paid for them.",
      "United would be better off cutting their losses and selling one of them at the very least. Based on this calendar year, Zirkzee is the more attractive option to keep, meaning Hojlund would be the prime candidate to offload.",
      "United are already well on their way to achieving this ambition by attempting to wrap up the signing of Wolves star Matheus Cunha. United are prepared to pay his £62.5m release clause and are currently in talks over the structure of the payments.",
      "United need fresh blood in their attacking department and Cunha, on the back of a 15-goal Premier League season, is just the sort of signing they should be making.",
      "Depending on what happens elsewhere, there is also an argument to suggest they should bring in another No.10, especially if Amad is deployed as a right wing-back. However, the size of their budget will dictate what is possible on that front."

      "A Serie A title winner, an Eredivisie title winner, the top scorer in Ligue 1, a European winner, a European finalist, another promoted to the Premier League and a West Ham player of the year. They have all left Manchester United within the past 12 months.",
      "Has anyone checked on Willy Kambwala? It turns out Villarreal finished fifth in La Liga to qualify for the Europa League. Another solid effort.",
      "And United still got it right to sell or loan Scott McTominay, Tyrell Malacia, Mason Greenwood, Jadon Sancho, Antony, Hannibal Mejbri, Aaron Wan-Bissaka and Kambwala.",
      "McTominay is the most contentious. He was named the MVP (a commercialised term in a footballing country as pure as Italy) in Serie A after inspiring Napoli to a fourth Scudetto in their history. In Naples, McTominay is worthy of mention in the same breath as Maradona.",
      "The Scot tallied 10 goals in his final season for United when goals were hard to come by. Rasmus Hojlund, a purported No.9, scraped that many in 2024-25. McTominay got 12 for Napoli.",
      "But McTominay was expendable. United needed a defensive midfielder and to accommodate one, someone had to make way. McTominay was the only sellable asset.",
      "And, at times, he was neither here nor there. Erik ten Hag could not make his mind up as to whether McTominay was defensive or attack-minded. McTominay's two lifesaving goals past the 90-minute mark against Brentford made Ten Hag's mind up for him. Occasionally, he would turn on the charm, such as when he hugged a sympathetic female broadcaster in the MCG mixed zone in Melbourne.",
      "Not everyone was sorry to see the back of McTominay, either. \"Where do you want me?\" he brusquely asked a press officer at Carrington last season.",
      "Shifting McTominay was not exactly as incendiary as Mark Hughes, Paul Ince or Andrei Kanchelskis leaving in 1995. The only Premier League club that bid for him were Fulham, as close as you can get to an early retirement home in the top flight.",
      "Fulham are not synonymous with ambition. They are a stable club in a salubrious area of London, so the appeal is obvious. A year earlier, West Ham United tried to lure McTominay down the M6.",
      "Napoli finished tenth in 2023-24. Italy remains a league in decline since the Calciopoli scandal in 2006. Its top flight has been a dumping ground for English clubs for years.",
      "And Antonio Conte is a stickler for a United reject. He had four of them at Inter Milan - Romelu Lukaku, Alexis Sanchez, Matteo Darmian and Ashley Young.",
      "This is not to diminish McTominay's fabulous feat and he is destined to be deified in Naples. Conte is a demanding coach and he recognised McTominay's robustness and goal-getting nous. A midfielder who is comfortably a top-half Premier League-level player is bound to have a profound effect on a mid-table Italian side.",
      "So United cashed in. The risk was the replacement. Replacing McTominay, remoulded as an attacking midfielder by Ten Hag, with a defensive midfielder ought to have made comparisons with Manuel Ugarte moot.",
      "Only Ugarte has been the poorest of United's five summer signings. So much so he was benched for the Europa League final. He is 24 and appears ill-prepared to anchor a midfield that Casemiro has retaken brief ownership of.",
      "Nobody foresaw the spiral at United. Now, of course, McTominay would improve their defence, midfield or attack. The somewhat contrary case to keep McTominay would have been as a striker. He is no shrinking violet and his instinct in front of goal trumps Hojlund's.",
      "United negotiated a fee rising to £50.75m for Ugarte. Napoli will pay a maximum of £30m for McTominay. It is not the first time United have miscalculated players' value.",
      "Or misjudged it. Alvaro Fernandez, never afforded a debut at United, was mismanaged by Ten Hag before he was sold to Benfica for an up-front fee of £5.1m. The word is he will now go back to where it started at Real Madrid.",
      "United would bank a sell-on fee if Fernandez is sold. His sale last year was totally logical as Ten Hag had no time for him. Left back was Ten Hag's blind spot, whether it be signing Malacia, sanctioning a new contract for Luke Shaw, loaning in Sergio Reguilon, shifting Diogo Dalot there or selling Fernandez.",
      "Fernandez, 22, was a Champions League knockout participant with Benfica this season. So was Marcus Rashford with Aston Villa.",
      "Of all the United departures, the loudest noise surrounded Rashford, who rarely hit the right notes at Aston Villa. His impact was grossly overstated before a hamstring injury curtailed his time at Villa Park. Unai Emery will not be having him back.",
      "DELAP A DODGED BULLET",
      "After Michael Owen scored his first United goal at Wigan Athletic, there was a rendition of \"You Scouse b*****d\" in the away end. Some United fans at the DW Stadium that day would assure you the derision was genuine.",
      "Some lapped up Owen having the chutzpah to move to United, despite his Liverpool links. Others saw through him. He had tried to engineer a return to Liverpool earlier that summer when the only serious suitors were Stoke City and Hull City. Then Sir Alex Ferguson, a fellow horse racing addict, invited him to breakfast.",
      "You wonder whether Liam Delap would have ever overcome the 'City reject' tag had he opted for United over Chelsea. He would have been under more scrutiny than Hojlund and is only four days younger.",
      "The United technical director Jason Wilcox watched Delap develop at City's academy when he was its director. If he was not good enough for City, then he should not be deemed good enough for United.",
      "Factually, Delap is. He is better than any of United's strikers. But United need a proven goalscorer, not another No.9 with potential. They have ended the last two league seasons with a minus goal difference. Moving for Delap just because of a release clause and Wilcox's say-so was a cop-out.",
      "Wilcox should be relieved. He would have been held responsible if Delap was a dud. Delap will get cut a thicker slice of slack at Chelsea, a club that do not generate anywhere near as much scrutiny or criticism as United.",
      "When United relinquished the Premier League title to City in 2012, it was on goal difference. That smarted so sorely for Ferguson that he hijacked City's planned signing of Robin van Persie. Van Persie's goals put the red and white ribbons back on the Premier League trophy.",
      "United have to think similarly, even with their financial limitations."

      "However, it's suggested that the deal has been delayed, even if the transfer window doesn't open until June 1. According to Fabrizio Romano, the issue holding up Cunha's move relates to attaining a visa.",
      "\"Matheus Cunha to Man Utd is a here we go,\" Romano told his YouTube channel. \"Matheus Cunha to Manchester United is a done deal. But many of you keep asking me where is Matheus Cunha? In the sense that there is no medical, no deal signed, no official statement, no formal steps.",
      "\"My understanding is it's just about waiting for the Visa. So Cunha is waiting for Visa [to be approved] and meanwhile Man Utd are preparing everything for the medical and contract signing, then for the sure the formal steps will be coordinated with the Brazilian national team staff because then Cunha will join the Brazilian national team with Carlo Ancelotti (on international duty).",
      "\"So [Man Utd] are working on the location [for the medical], working on every single step including the Visa, but Matheus Cunha will be a Manchester United player, don’t worry about that.",
      "\"Also because Man Utd already started exchanging all the documents with Wolves after they triggered the £62.5m release clause paid by the end of 2027 in instalments. So everything is agreed, everything is done, the player will sign a five-year deal with a one-year option. Cunha will go to United.\"",
      "If everything goes to plan, Cunha is expected to slot straight into Amorim's XI and fill the left No.10 berth. He is well-versed in a wing-back system from his time at Wolves, meaning it should be a seamless transition for him.",
      "Cunha scored 15 goals and provided six assists in 33 appearances during the 2024/25 season for Wolves, winning the club's Players' Player of the Season in the process. His contribution helped drag Vitor Pereira's side from inside the relegation zone and into mid-table, although Wolves ended up finishing down in 16th.",
      "After Wolves' final game of the season against Brentford last Sunday, Cunha issued an emotional message on Instagram, as he bid farewell to the club's supporters. He said: \"Wolves, what can I say to you?",
      "\"What an incredible season. We didn't get to where you deserve to be, but we did everything we could to make you proud. I love these guys.\"Individually, it was the best season of my life. All of this was only possible because of all the dedication and love I have for this club. I became the Brazilian with the most goals in a Premier League season, along with @roberto_firmino and @gabriel.martinelli.",

      "In Cunha, United are attempting to recruit a luxury player who can make something happen in the blink of an eye. He was a joy to watch at times throughout the 2024/25 campaign and he contributed 17 goals and six assists across all competitions.",
      "United will be hoping he can replicate similar numbers at Old Trafford and increase their attacking output. United have finished each of the last two Premier League campaigns with a negative goal difference.",
      "Although his primary responsibility will be to score and create goals, Cunha will be expected to work tirelessly for the team out of possession. Amorim sets exceptionally high demands for his players to adhere to when they do not have the ball, urging them to press as much as possible.",
      "Speaking last December, the United head coach said: \"[It is] impossible to win the Premier League without a team that doesn't run. You can do a starting line-up with the best players on the planet, without running they also won't win.",
      "\"We have to run like mad dogs, if not we won't win. The problem is can they cope with that? If they are used to it in training, they will do it in games.",
      "\"They can improve. You cannot be faster, but you can run more in training. They are professional athletes. Every coach has a different method of pressing.\"",
      "With that in mind, Cunha will have no choice but to alter one particular element of his game. Of the outfield players that played a minimum of 1,800 minutes in the Premier League this season, Cunha spent more time walking around the pitch than anyone else.",
      "Data gathered by Opta shows that Cunha spent 77.1 per cent of his time on the pitch walking. The rest of the Premier League's top five 'walkers', interestingly, were all centre-backs, with the Brazilian being joined at the top of the table by Liverpool captain Virgil van Dijk (76.6%), Nottingham Forest's Murillo (74.3%, Ezri Konsa of Aston Villa (74.2% and fellow Forest star Ola Aina (73.8%).",
      "Of course, it can and will be argued that Cunha makes up for that slight downside to his game with his goals and creativity, which is arguably much more important than how quickly he makes his way around the pitch. However, working tirelessly without the ball is a non-negotiable for Amorim.",
      "The Portuguese's call for his players to \"run like mad dogs\" ought to serve as a warning to Cunha and urge him to transform one particular element of his play. If he can improve that, United will inherit an even better player."

      "Manchester United have been told by Danny Murphy that the consequences will be “devastating” if their best player leaves this summer amid heavy Saudi threat.",
      "United finished 15th in the Premier League and lost the Europa League this season. The campaign will surely go down as one of the worst in their history.",
      "One of the only shining lights was Bruno Fernandes, who was directly involved in 39 goals in an otherwise below-par side.",
      "There has been a lot of speculation about his future, with the attacking midfielder courted by the Saudi Pro League at the minute, having reportedly had ‘positive talks’ with Al-Hilal.",
      "Former Premier League midfielder Murphy does not feel Fernandes can be allowed to leave.",
      "Writing in the Daily Mail, he stated it is ‘imperative’ that the midfielder stays at United, as if not, and he kicks off next season in Saudi Arabia, the ‘consequences will be devastating’ for the Old Trafford outfit.",
      "Murphy has praised Fernandes for wanting to ‘stand up and be counted during a terribly difficult period’. He also stated that the recent successes of the club, reaching cup finals, is ‘down to Bruno’.",
      "The pundit suggests that the sale of Fernandes, who is 30 and would surely command a giant fee makes ‘financial sense’ but from a performance perspective he is ‘irreplaceable’.",
      "Indeed, though United want to sign a new striker, and the sale would help to finance that, whoever is signed would be ‘far less effective without having the wonderful passes and crosses Bruno would provide’ per Murphy.",
      "Speculation over Fernandes’ exit has been ramped up given Cristiano Ronaldo is being eyed by Al-Hilal, who wants Fernandes to join him ahead of the Club World Cup.",
      "Insider Graeme Bailey said: “Al-Hilal are going for this. Inzaghi, Ronaldo and now the Premier League’s finest.",
      "“I am told that Ronaldo has told Al-Hilal to get Bruno. There is a real belief within the corridors of power in Saudi football that they can get Bruno.",
      "“They are offering him wages only Ronaldo and Benzema have surpassed, they really are pushing the boat out.",
      "“United have told Bruno he isn’t going…but 100 million would be a lot to turn down for a player of his age, no matter how important.”",
      "Real Madrid legend Cristiano Ronaldo has reportedly told Al-Hilal that they will need to sign Man Utd captain Bruno Fernandes if they want him to join.",
      "Man Utd captain Bruno Fernandes holds the key to the Red Devils’ potential efforts to sign Victor Osimhen in the summer, according to reports.",
      "Man Utd co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe is running the risk of falling out with Red Devils boss Ruben Amorim over Bruno Fernandes, according to reports.",
      "Man Utd midfielder Bruno Fernandes is ‘very close’ to leaving Old Trafford for Al-Hilal ahead of the summer transfer window, according to reports.",
      "A pundit has told Manchester United they would “probably be relegated” without a star who is reportedly considering quitting the club this summer.",
      "Man Utd captain Bruno Fernandes could now ‘quit’ the Red Devils as his potential future takes yet another U-turn, according to reports."

      "“We were a part of a team that was so well mannered. We understood what it meant to play for Manchester United. We understood what the badge meant.",
      "“Wherever we travelled, whether it was in Europe or in Asia, we respected the fans.",
      "“We respected the fact that they were turning up, paying money and wanting you to sign and take pictures. You respect that.”",
      "Indeed, United have one of the largest fanbases in the world, and it is not a good look for their current crop to be seen to be disrespecting them.",
      "Things on the field are clearly not good, too, and the board will have to spend the summer rectifying things so that the Manchester outfit have a better time next season, trying to bounce back from 15th in the league.",
      "Manchester United legends Gary Neville and David Beckham have ‘completed a takeover’ of Salford City worth around £15m as part of a ‘new consortium’.",
      "Marcus Rashford has not ruled out a Man Utd return and could embark on the sort of redemption arc which embarrassed Real Madrid and Jose Mourinho.",
      "Harry Kane has rocketed while Jordan Henderson is moving again. Jude Bellingham keeps rising up the foreign-based England player ranks.",

      "PSG have taken the long road to Champions League glory – with humiliations by Manchester United and Newcastle – but Luis Enrique has ended their ‘obsession’.",
      "",
      "“The Champions League is not at all an obsession – that is over. I said that at the first press conference with Luis Enrique,” said PSG president Nasser Al-Khelaifi with all the conviction of a man whose sportswashing had shrunk under the pressure of one too many loads.",
      "“We are building a new identity; our own style, our own principles of how to play, an offensive play, and a new culture. That’s what we want, and then the results will follow.",
      "“We are building a team that is really playing as a team. We want our players to enjoy playing, our staff to enjoy coaching, and for our fans to enjoy it when you watch.”",
      "Ten days later, PSG were beaten 4-1 at St James’ Park. The players, staff and fans cannot have particularly enjoyed watching Miguel Almiron, Dan Burn, Sean Longstaff and Fabian Schar score against Europe’s perennial underachievers – although the schadenfreude was irresistible for neutrals.",
      "It has been a long, arduous and often absurd journey to the summit. PSG have avoided the ultimate ignominy of exiting at the group stage ever since this odyssey began, but the trade-off for that has been a preposterous propensity to stumble at all manner of other hurdles: consecutive away-goal eliminations by Barcelona and Chelsea; victims of La Remontada; a humiliation so thorough it forced Manchester United to make Ole Gunnar Solskjaer their manager for more than two years; being entirely and utterly Karim Benzema’d in the Bernabeu.",
      "PSG and the Champions League had been in a toxic, unrequited relationship for years, and the former was kidding itself if they ever believed themselves to be in a position to declare it “over”.",
      "But Luis Enrique has broken the cycle.",
      "The Spaniard’s words at his unveiling became a eulogy at the funeral of Inter’s entire psyche. “The attacking identity is non-negotiable – it’s my philosophy. You have to adapt to your players, my job is to get the best out of my players individually and collectively. I am committed to putting a winning team together and I have no doubt that I will be able to do that and give PSG fans something they will like.”",
      "There were tears in the stands, in the dugout, on the pitch. It was historic but harrowing, a traumatic scene of youthful exuberance obliterating grizzled experience. It was the end of the road for Inter, who would have taken Boyz II Men 0 as early as the 20th minute had they been offered the choice. And after almost a decade and a half it is the belated start of what PSG hope to translate into a period of utter dominance.",
      "Over the course of those 90 minutes it was difficult to envisage any other scenario developing over the next few years. The youngest starting line-up in a Champions League final this century produced two of the five youngest ever European Cup final scorers. The man of the match was 19-year-old Desire Doue. The only player older than 30 of the 16 used was record appearance maker Marquinhos. This is not a group on the verge of disbanding.",
      "That provided an interesting juxtaposition with Inter, for whom this was a second Champions League final in three years, but with the tangible sense it would be their last together. The future of Simone Inzaghi is deeply uncertain, three of their starters were at least 36 and the rest were made to look twice as old. PSG started by hammering the ball out for a throw-in deep in Inter’s half and for the subsequent hour and a half rarely afforded them the opportunity to escape.",
      "This was their last stand and the early mistakes betrayed it, culminating in the double salvo from Federico Dimarco which ended the game as a contest. He was caught in his own offside trap and then later isolated by Doue down the right as PSG took the quickest two-goal lead in final history.",
      "Willian Pacho was winning everything, including a battle with Nico Barella as the Inter midfielder hoped to shepherd the ball out for a corner, only for the PSG centre-half to poke it away and launch the counter which produced the second goal. Achraf Hakimi started popping up at centre-forward and on the left-wing.",
      "Hakan Calhanoglu, the set-piece master, was gifted a presentable free-kick in the vicinity of the PSG area and thumped it straight out for a goal kick early in the second half; it summed the proceedings up neatly.",
      "Then came the landslide. Inzaghi made his changes, four by the hour mark. The sight of Matteo Darmian taking to the pitch somehow did not galvanise Inter but PSG derived motivation from it anyway, hitting a ridiculous triple punch of quality goals: Vitinha to Doue; Ousmane Dembele to Khvicha Kvaratskhelia; Bradley Barcola to fellow substitute Senny Mayulu.",
      "It was almost painful to watch by the end, particularly through the prism of the hapless Francesco Acerbi.",
      "Perhaps only Kylian Mbappe had a more uncomfortable night as the modern-day Michael Owen: the prodigy distracted by the lights of Real Madrid, only for his boyhood club to thrive and immediately capture the sport’s biggest prize in his absence. He might be able to console himself with having scored in that Newcastle defeat.",
      "As it is, the evening belonged not to Al-Khelaifi – despite some weird yet entirely predictable “win for football” nonsense – but Luis Enrique. His personal story is touching enough but even on a professional level it is refreshing to watch such a phenomenally talented and often overlooked coach achieve something so historic.",
      "This PSG success cannot be framed properly without acknowledging the vast spend needed to deliver it. With the highest wage bill in Europe and over £200m invested on transfers this season alone it is, in many ways, simple maths. But Enrique going where incredible managers before him could not at least means something.",
      "And that thing, ultimately, is a Super Cup final against Spurs. It is the showdown of Europe’s true greatest teams we all deserve, and the only real way to celebrate the long-awaited climax of an “obsession”.",
      "There are 10 Champions League final participants who are either Premier League rejects or never made it there at all…",
      "Chelsea rejected Luis Enrique twice, Arsenal turned him down for two reasons, Spurs pulled out at the last hurdle and Manchester United came close too.",
      "Paris Saint-Germain boss Luis Enrique insists he’s “not worried at all” about facing Arsenal after the French side’s unexpected defeat against Nice.",
      "Youri Tielemans and Luis Enrique have been speaking to the press ahead of Aston Villa’s huge Champions League clash with Paris-Saint Germain."

      "Four hours after their final day victory over Aston Villa at the end of a miserable season, the United squad jetted off for a two-game 36-hour tour of Asia.",
      "The players were booed off after a 1-0 defeat to ASEAN All-Stars in Kuala Lumpur on Wednesday, before a brace from Chido Obi and a stoppage time goal from Ayden Heaven secured a 3-1 victory over Hong Kong on Friday.",
      "The travelling party included several United players expected not to be at the club next season, including Alejandro Garnacho, who’s reportedly been told by Amorim that he’s not in his plans moving forward.",
      "The Argentinian is the subject of interest from Napoli, while Chelsea and Aston Villa have also been linked with a move for the 20-year-old, who’s valued at £60m by United.",
      "And he was one of three United players, along with Amad Diallo and Manuel Ugarte, ‘advised to refrain from’ raising their middle fingers to fans on tour, according to The Athletic.",
      "The report states:",
      "‘The tension of United’s trip appeared to be evident in a few instances of players flipping the finger to fans. Amad did so as he walked into the W hotel in Kuala Lumpur, following the first game, later apologising on social media in two posts a day apart but saying his mother had been insulted by an “unhealthy individual”. The words used are not clear from video footage of the incident.",
      "‘Separately, Amad had raised his middle finger in the direction of Garnacho during a packed elevator selfie with a couple of fans while Garnacho did the same to camera. Garnacho also showed the gesture at a signing event for supporters in the Adidas shop at the Exchange TRX mall in Kuala Lumpur, causing bemusement to the person taking the picture and as he walked off the pitch following the game against ASEAN All-Stars, the photographer there complained.’",
      "The gesture, which Manuel Ugarte has also been doing in selfied with fans all season, ‘was being used in an ironic, playful manner’, but after club staff ‘realised the negative reaction’ the players were told to stop it.",
      "A ‘swift return to families’ after the tour was thought to be essential given the players’ reaction to being forced to go in the first place.",
      "The report adds that both Victor Lindelof and Christian Eriksen were originally told they would have to join the touring party despite both of them leaving the club at the end of June when their contracts come to an end.",
      "‘But each one pushed back,’ the report states, with United eventually accepting Lindelof’s wife being heavily pregnant and Eriksen getting married as acceptable excuses for them not to travel with the group.",
      "According to reports, new Bayer Leverkusen head coach Erik ten Hag is plotting a raid on former club Manchester United as he looks to replace Florian Wirtz.",
      "Manchester United winger Amad Diallo has revealed the feeling in the Red Devils squad after reports that Ruben Amorim essentially told Alejandro Garnacho his career there was over.",
      "According to reports, head coach Ruben Amorim has issued a ‘brutal message’ to Manchester United winger Alejandro Garnacho, who has been ‘kicked out’.",

      "Romano said: “My information is that Man Utd can also add one more player in the No 10 position. So to play behind the striker.",
      "“It is a possibility but it will be based on outgoings. So Cunha is expected to join and one more player [for the No 10 spots] depending on outgoings. This is the plan at Manchester United.”",

      "READ: Man Utd’s seven striker options after Liam Delap snubbed them for Chelsea",
      "It is claimed that an ‘offer’ of €95m (£80m) is ‘on the table’ currently for Fernandes with ‘the player’s entourage is also seriously considering the offer’.",
      "Al-Hilal ‘not only promises a contract worthy of his status, but is also offering a staggering sum: €25 million net for each of the seasons he signs at his new destination.’",
      "“Never say never in the transfer market, the window hasn’t even opened yet. Anything could eventually happen.",
      "“I just watched Ruben Amorim there and he would have been told by his media handlers: ‘You’re going to be asked about this story, it’s a massive story – just play it with a straight bat and say he’s a Manchester United player and he’s got two years left on his contract, I’m not going to talk about media speculation.’",
      "“He didn’t do that. He came out and gave us quite a lot.",
      "“You could tell he’s spoken to Bruno Fernandes and been told by him: ‘I’ve got this incredible offer, it’s like I’ve won Euro Millions, £200m over three years. This is life-changing money, boss but you know I’m not motivated by money. I love football, I love Manchester United.’",
      "“I think he’s sat down and spoken to Ruben Amorim and he’s told him he is an integral part of the rebuild at Manchester United. I think he’s happy to stay.”",

      "And sure, the club has debt saddled on it by its owners – its not ideal, but again it’s not the death of the club just yet. Debt is designed for companies to use. It would have been nice not to have had the debt, but that’s our Glazers legacy, so we have to deal with it. People and pundits seem to say that United are dead and buried because this summer we can’t afford to stump up 100m for X and 75m for Y, and 80m Z wont come because we’re not in the Champions League.",

      "Forest were many pundits’ picks for relegation last year, and having unearthed (amongst others) two very cheap diamonds in central defense, pushed for the top 4 until the very last game of the season. Bournemouth continue to sit top half of the table, give pretty much anyone a decent game, and have only ever paid over 25m once in their history. Ditto Fulham, who have never paid more than the 34m they paid for Emil Smith Rowe. Ditto Brentford. Villa only came back up to the Prem 6 seasons ago….!",
      "The point being, just because we cant have a summer of getting all the current fad names, doesn’t mean we’re done and dusted. Ok, I agree that the squad needs some decent additions, but at least our transfer business is getting better.",

      "2-4 years ago was utterly disastrous – Sancho, Antony, (if Greenwood hadn’t smacked his girlfriend, we’d have saved £150m not having to buy those two), Hojlund (nowhere near value, but think he’s been unlucky, if still below average). I love Casemiro, but hard to say his signing was astute and financially sound.",
      "Last season – far better. Mazraoui, good value. De Ligt – meh, at least we didn’t pay 75, 40 was probably about right if he can stay fit. Yoro – looks a decent player and will only improve. Ugarte – hmmmm not so sure yet, looks a little lightweight for a DMC in the prem, and passing is shocking. Zirkzee – decent footballer, just a shame about his total lack of pace, odd signing.",

He will get better, stronger, brighter. And Heaven, £1.5m for an 18 year old who already looks pretty useful, definitely great value.",

      "Personally I think this is all a bit premature and there’s too much reading into a couple of seasons where, frankly, the promoted teams were just poor and barely even gave themselves a chance at staying up.",
      "One of the arguments seems to be that of the other 17 clubs there are no obvious candidates to go down. But I disagree. We could easily have a very open relegation dogfight with any of West Ham, Wolves, Everton, Fulham, Bournemouth, Palace and Brentford all potentially in the mix with the 3 newbies.",
      "Who knows which of those clubs will lose key players and potentially their manager over the Summer. A lot can change from one season to the next. Sometimes even a small change can make a big difference. Just look at how Wolves were transformed when they replaced their manager. What if they lose Pereira and make a bad decision in appointing his successor?",
      "If you look back to the 22/23 season, the 3 relegated clubs finished 8th, 15th and 17th the previous season. Did anyone really see Leicester getting relegated that season? Not many, I imagine. Southampton went down after 12 consecutive seasons in the Prem and were not widely tipped to be relegated that season.",
      "And fundamentally it comes down to how well the promoted clubs prepare themselves. When my team Brentford came up, we added a few new faces but most of the promotion-winning squad remained intact. It was a long term plan coming together because we were (and are) an extremely well-managed club. Same with Brighton. Same with Bournemouth. Same with Fulham.",
      "So I really don’t agree it’s a closed shop. Is it tough to get promoted and stay in the PL? Absolutely. But why shouldn’t it be? In terms of depth, it’s the strongest league in the world, by a distance. But if clubs come up with no real vision and either just hope for the best or think throwing some money at players with little strategy will keep them up, they shouldn’t be surprised if they end up struggling. And they shouldn’t be blaming the Premier League for that.\nRob, Surrey, Bees fan",

      "A pundit has told Manchester United they would “probably be relegated” without a star who is reportedly considering quitting the club this summer.",
      "United had their worst season in Premier League history in 2024-25. After finishing eighth the season prior, they slumped down to 15th in the top flight.",
      "Only three players, Bruno Fernandes, Amad Diallo and Alejandro Garnacho, scored more than five goals in the Premier League.",
      "Discussing the future of Fernandes on talkSPORT, Troy Deeney suggested United’s season would have been very bleak without him",
      "“You can’t deny his quality. If it wasn’t for him this season, they probably would be relegated.”",
      "United finished on 42 points, 17 ahead of the final relegated side, Leicester. Given Fernandes scored eight goals and assisted another 11, without him, things could indeed have been much worse for them.",
      "That is pertinent for the upcoming season, with a lot of speculation over the attacking midfielder’s potential exit. It’s said Fernandes’ agent has held ‘positive talks’ with Al Hilal over a very lucrative contract there, and he’s ‘giving serious thought to quitting’ United.",
      "Indeed, he’s said to be mulling over the proposal, with the Saudi Arabian side wanting an answer from Fernandes soon, as they’d like him for the Club World Cup if he was to be signed, which begins on June 14.",
      "It remains to be seen whether the United man would actually give up on the Old Trafford outfit, given he stated after the Europa League final loss: “I have always been honest. I’ve always said I will be here until the club says to me that it’s time to go.",
      "“I’m eager to do more, to be able to bring the club the great days. In the day that the club thinks that I’m too much or it’s time to part ways, football is like this, you never know it. But I’ve always said it and I keep my word in the same way.",
      "“If the club thinks it’s time to part ways because they want to do some cashing in or whatever, it’s what it is, and football sometimes is like this.”",

      "Manchester United will reportedly ‘reignite’ their interest in two strikers after losing out to Chelsea on the signing of Ipswich striker Liam Delap.",
      "United have been linked with a number of the world’s top strikers of late. It’s evident they need some quality in attack, after neither Rasmus Hojlund nor Joshua Zirkzee managed more than five Premier League goals this season, despite both playing north of 30 games.",
      "United’s favourite target for a while looked to be Ipswich’s Delap. They were among a host of Premier League sides who were willing to pay his £30million release clause, and it was even suggested they’d broadly agreed personal terms with his entourage, waiting for the green light from the striker himself.",
      "However, multiple outlets have stated Delap has instead agreed to sign with Chelsea, and GIVEMESPORT states that after United were ‘unable to convince’ him to sign, they will move onto ‘alternative options’.",
      "It’s been reported as a ‘major blow’ for Delap to have been taken off the board, but it means the Red Devils will apparently ‘reignite their interest’ in Randal Kolo Muani and Jean-Philippe Mateta, from Paris Saint-Germain and Crystal Palace, respectively.",
      "It is said United will ‘make checks’ over whether Kolo Muani would be an ideal fit, after they considered recruiting him in January, when he went on loan to Juventus – he scored eight goals in 16 Serie A games there.",
      "It is believed it would cost £35million for PSG to sell the Frenchman. But it’s said the preference at Old Trafford would be to land a striker who is already experienced in the Premier League.",
      "As such Mateta has come back into their thinking, especially after playing a key role in Palace winning the FA Cup. He assisted a goal in the 3-0 semi-final win over Aston Villa, while the Palace man has been in electric form in the Premier League recently.",
      "This season, Mateta scored 14 goals and assisted two. The report places him at £40million, though our friends at TEAMtalk suggest the Eagles would not let him go for less than £50million.",
      "They state that negotiations could be tricky, as Palace are keen to retain Mateta. He will play European football with them for the first time in his career, and that’s something which is not on offer at Old Trafford.",
      "Man Utd have ‘positioned themselves’ to sign a PL star as one of four ‘fallback’ striker options as Omar Berrada’s relationship with an agent hampers a £63m deal.",

      "We know he wants Champions League football, we know – according to the Guardian at least – that he does not want to play for a London club, and we know that Villa have agreed a £40m fee for Rashford but United would want more money from any other club.",
      "So where will he end up? These are the favourites for his home in 2025/26 according to the latest odds and reports:",
      "",
      "1) Barcelona\nThe ‘dream’, apparently. There was lengthy talk of a loan to the Spanish giants in January but they pulled other levers instead and Rashford is said to be keen to join ‘no matter what‘. The problem? Barcelona are said to be reluctant to pay £40m for Rashford, which is surely the very least that Manchester United will accept after he proved he is still a very effective and motivated footballer at Villa.",
      "The latest reports indicate that Barcelona will sign Rashford on loan next season.",
      "",
      "2) Manchester United\nIs there a chance that he stays and is rehabilitated? It seems very bloody unlikely but it has happened before. Surely this is only a scenario if no Champions League club will pay £40m, in which case another loan seems rather more likely than being reintegrated by Ruben Amorim.",
      "",
      "3) Any Saudi Pro League club\nWe simply can’t see it. Surely even a reconciliation at Manchester United would be better than the desert.",
      "",
      "4=) Aston Villa\nHe’s there, he’s happy, he clearly has a good relationship with the manager and the club’s fans and he has played some excellent football for Villa as they reached the Champions League quarter-finals. But – and this is quite a big but – they are bound for the Europa League and Rashford, now more than ever, will feel like he is a Champions League player, which might lead him to…",

They are long-time admirers, the £40m would be no issue and they are Champions League stalwarts. But would they really bring in Rashford so soon after forking out for the rather impressive Khvicha Kvaratskhelia?",

      "",

      "",
      "6=) AC Milan\nA throwback to the January move that never was, which was scuppered by Milan’s more pressing need for Kyle Walker. Milan cannot offer Champions League football so it feels like that particular ship has sailed.",
      "",
      "6=) Juventus\nAnother throwback to those January rumours, Juventus have not been linked ahead of the summer but they sneaked back into the Champions League, so they could be an option.",
      "",
      "9) Borussia Dortmund\nThey pushed and they pushed hard in January, hoping to recreate the Jadon Sancho magic. And they surely become an option again after reaching the Champions League.",
      "",

Marseille reached it amid claims of corruption, bribery and much worse, while Milan boasted a side containing Paolo Maldini, Franco Baresi, Gianluigi Lentini and Marco van Basten in his final game ever. They were kept at bay by Fabian Barthez, Marcel Desailly and Basile Boli, who scored the only goal shortly before half-time.",

      "28) 1996 – Ajax 1-1 Juventus (2-4 on penalties)\nA similarly sketchy final in hindsight again undeniably pitted the continent’s two best sides against one another, but the subsequent game was less than the sum of its numerous parts. Goalscorers Fabrizio Ravanelli and Jari Litmanen – both of whom capitalised on goalkeeping mistakes – would experience varying Premier League careers thereafter but even the former would struggle to conjure many memories besides his opener and lifting the trophy.",
      "",
      "27) 2021 – Manchester City 0-1 Chelsea\nWhile 19 points separated the two teams in the Premier League, Pep Guardiola helped bridge that chasm by turning his nose up at the idea of playing a holding midfielder. Thomas Tuchel welcomed the unexpected olive branch and a year after succumbing to a 1-0 defeat in the final with Paris Saint-Germain, the German engineered victory by the same scoreline thanks to Kai Havertz. But even Chelsea supporters would admit it was no classic.",
      "",
      "26) 2001 – Bayern Munich 1-1 Valencia (5-4 on penalties)\nThe all-penalty final saw Gaizka Mendieta and Steffan Effenberg trade spot-kicks in normal time, with Santiago Canizares saving from Mehmet Scholl, before Bayern triumphed in an eventual shootout. There were 28 shots so attacking football was not in particularly short order, but only goalkeeping fetishists would have truly enjoyed themselves.",
      "",
      "25) 2019 – Tottenham 0-2 Liverpool\nAn early goal can do one of two things to a match with such high stakes: galvanise the team that concedes and lead to a pulsating game; or encourage the scorers to become more defensive, resolute and frustrating as they seek to protect their advantage. The 2019 Champions League final was a prime example of the latter.",
      "Mo Salah put Liverpool in front in the second minute and while Tottenham were the better side thereafter, they never really recovered to the point where they threatened to equalise. Divock Origi provided the last slice of bread to a fairly mediocre sandwich just before the final whistle.",

      "",
      "24) 2022 – Liverpool 0-1 Real Madrid\nThis final, moved to Paris from St Petersburg, is remembered most for the shambles which unfolded outside the Stade de France and the shameful cover-up that followed. On the pitch, it was the Thibaut Courtois final, with the Real Madrid keeper using his Mr Tickle arms to great effect, repelling everything Liverpool threw at him. After Vinicius Junior’s second-half strike, the belief slowly drained from the Reds with each stop Courtois made.",
      "",
      "23) 2000 – Real Madrid 3-0 Valencia\nThat both finalists came from the same country for the first time in European Cup history did not help the first showpiece of the new millennium. Real Madrid actually finished lower than Valencia in La Liga – fifth to third – but the nature of the destruction gave it an air of a typical domestic meeting rather than the biggest match of the season. Steve McManaman’s volley was lovely, mind.",
      "",
      "22) 2023 – Manchester City 1-0 Inter Milan\nThe expectation was perhaps this would be a poor final because it was such a mis-match between the best team in Europe and the third-best team in Italy, but the reality was that Inter did an excellent job of disrupting City, who rarely got into their stride. Rodri scored a belter but City barely bothered the Italians otherwise, and they found Ederson to be a stubborn opponent themselves. The result was historic but few will remember the game.",
      "",
      "21) 2007 – Milan 2-1 Liverpool\nA final can sometimes suffer for its lack of freshness. Milan and Liverpool, of course, had the unenviable task of living up to their incredible clash of just two years prior; they never really stood a chance. The three goals were little more than ordinary and partial Dani Alves alternative Jermaine Pennant was probably the best player, for Christ’s sake.",
      "",
      "20) 2017 – Juventus 1-4 Real Madrid\nMario Mandzukic’s equaliser, one of the three greatest goals in Champions League final history, deserved so much more. Juventus were primed to deliver as much as late as the hour mark as they were still level, but they simply could not keep up as Real feigned to help The Old Lady cross the road before pushing them into onrushing traffic.",
      "",
      "19) 2009 – Barcelona 2-0 Manchester United\nThere goes that curse of the early goal again, the bane of many a neutral. Samuel Eto’o scored in the tenth minute and Lionel Messi the 70th as a ludicrous Barcelona side were just a level or two beyond Manchester United, who had just one shot on target in each half.",
      "",
      "18) 1998 – Juventus 0-1 Real Madrid\n“The 1998 Champions League final was possibly the most important game in Real Madrid’s history,” winning captain Manolo Sanchis once suggested, their 32-year wait to be crowned European champions finally coming to an end in Amsterdam. It was an incredible moment, but a fairly ordinary game.",

A total of 42 shots and 34 fouls made for a titanic tussle that Real eventually edged in a shootout.",
      "",
      "16) 2020 – PSG 0-1 Bayern Munich \nThe only final played behind closed doors when Covid was acting the d*** could have been a drab affair in the absence of fans but PSG and Bayern put on a decent spectacle in Lisbon. Both sides had good chances in the first half, with PSG desperate for their first European crown, but Bayern’s Champions League know-how told when Kingsley Coman headed in a winner on the hour before the Germans absorbed everything Mbappe and co. could throw at them.",
      "",
      "15) 2024 – Borussia Dortmund 0-2 Real Madrid\nAnother final in which the predicted procession did an immense disservice to the underdogs and exposed the favourites. Dortmund were as excellent as Real were poor in the first half and the Germans really should have led. Karim Adeyemi will forever be replaying that chance when put through on goal.",
      "But Real weathered that storm and their individual quality eventually told as Vinicius Junior carried them further into this era of dominance.",
      "",
      "14) 1995 – Ajax 1-0 Milan\nThe absolute state of those teams. Edwin van der Sar, Danny Blind, Paolo Maldini, Frank Rijkaard, Franco Baresi, Frank de Boer, Alessandro Costacurta, Clarence Seedorf, Marcel Desailly, Edgar Davids, Ronald de Boer, Zvonimir Boban, Jari Litmanen, Marc Overmars and Patrick Kluivert. With two managerial legends in Louis van Gaal and Fabio Capello filling the dugouts, there might never have been a more stacked final in terms of talent. The game itself was no less captivating.",
      "",
      "13) 2015 – Juventus 1-3 Barcelona\n“Spectacular” was the word Luis Enrique used to describe Barcelona’s win over Juventus in the 2015 Champions League final. History is written by the victors, of course, but it seems a generous interpretation. Not that it wasn’t an excellent game: the continent’s best defence gave a supreme attack quite the scare before eventually succumbing to defeat.",
      "",
      "12) 2018 – Real Madrid 3-1 Liverpool\nStarved of possibly its best player after half an hour, the 2018 Champions League final did not provide quite the pulsating mesh of styles it had promised. Liverpool were understandably subdued and Real plodded through large portions before the rest was largely lost in a cloud of goalkeeping embarrassment.",
      "",
      "11) 2011 – Barcelona 3-1 Manchester United\nAs far as exhibitions go, they don’t come much better. But there was always a sense of Barcelona and Manchester United being a bit of a mismatch, even when Wayne Rooney equalised after half an hour. Lionel Messi and David Villa had secured a third European Cup in six seasons before Sir Alex Ferguson knew what hit him, while Rooney was left begging for mercy.",
      "",
      "10) 2012 – Bayern Munich 1-1 Chelsea (3-4 on penalties)\nThe late drama of two goals in the final seven minutes went some way to undoing the relative monotony of the preceding 80 or so. It does, however, remain hilarious that Bayern Munich had 20 corners and failed to score from any, while Chelsea had only one and managed to rescue themselves with it.",
      "",
      "9) 2002 – Bayer Leverkusen 1-2 Real Madrid\nWere it not for an injury to starting goalkeeper Cesar, facilitating the introduction of Iker Casillas, an iconic moment in Champions League history might have been lost to the ether. As it was, Casillas made a string of impressive saves to preserve the lead Zinedine Zidane granted Los Blancos in spectacular fashion at Hampden Park. Few expected Leverkusen to make it so far but no-one could claim they didn’t contribute to a great game.",
      "",
      "8) 2006 – Barcelona 2-1 Arsenal\nWhile an early sending-off can so often inhibit a team and a spectacle, Arsenal seemed invigorated by the dismissal of Jens Lehmann in Paris in 2006. They took the lead through Sol Campbell and were 15 minutes from unthinkable glory before Henrik Larsson rewrote the script as only he could.",
      "",
      "7) 1999 – Manchester United 2-1 Bayern Munich\nWhen we finally drain the well of unoriginal content ideas and come to rank the greatest two-minute spells in Champions League history, Manchester United’s stoppage-time exploits against Bayern Munich in 1999 might well fare better. But there is a reason the Wikipedia summary of the first and second halves at the Nou Camp are offered as many paragraphs – three – as the entirety of injury-time.",

      "6) 2013 – Borussia Dortmund 1-2 Bayern Munich\nAfter their two Bundesliga meetings ended in 1-1 draws, Borussia Dortmund and Bayern Munich did battle at Wembley to settle the matter beyond all doubt.

Arjen Robben then scored the winner in the penultimate minute to conclude an even and excellent game.",

      "5) 2014 – Real Madrid 4-1 Atletico Madrid (after extra-time)\nWhen one team so obviously prepares for 90 minutes, the unexpected and sudden addition of 30 more can lead to something of a damp squib. Atletico Madrid led for almost an hour before Sergio Ramos’ last-gasp equaliser, at which point Diego Simeone’s side was drained both mentally and physically and bereft of substitutions. Extra-time was an exercise in brutality; it had become difficult to watch by the time Cristiano Ronaldo was baring his triumphant, flabby chest.",

Milan were without a number of injured and suspended players but ruthlessly dismantled Barcelona all the same. It just would have been nice if the Spaniards had turned up.",
      "",
      "3) 2008 – Manchester United 1-1 Chelsea\nSome continental meetings between two teams from the same nation suffer for familiarity. The 2008 Champions League final was the antidote to that particular poison, as Manchester United and Chelsea freely traded blows like super-heavyweights knowing this would be their defining bout. Cristiano Ronaldo landed the first blow, only to be floored by Frank Lampard. The dismissal of Didier Drogba in extra-time might even have inadvertently decided the destination of the cup, as John Terry slipped 12 yards from glory before Edwin van der Sar kept out Nicolas Anelka.",

      "2) 1997 – Borussia Dortmund 3-1 Juventus\nThe biggest surprise in Champions League final history benefited from an unexpected winner toppling a European superpower, a two-goal salvo from the uncelebrated Karl-Heinz Riedle, an understated backheel goal from Alessandro Del Piero and one of the finest examples of man-marking in the sport’s history as Paul Lambert shadowed Zinedine Zidane throughout.

      "“But my fear is whether he can make that formation work in any case. United have never played three at the back in their history, and apart from Inter, all the best teams in the world play with that back four.",
      "“With a lot of that current squad, we’re not talking about bad players. Some of these players earn a lot of money, and regardless of the formation, they have to be playing at a level higher than they are right now. To be fifth from the bottom is absolutely disastrous.",

      "As a result of having fewer matches to play next season, Amorim - who is hoping to bring Wolves forward Matheus Cunha to the club - wants to operate with a smaller squad that will be easier to manage next season.",
      "\"We always prepare two plans,\" said the Portuguese at the start of the club's preseason tour of Malaysia and Hong Kong. \"With and without the Champions League. Without the Champions League, we also don't need a big squad.",
      "\"We can control the squad in a better way. Then we have a plan, that is to bring in some new players, but our big plan is to improve the team we have, to improve the Academy.",
      "\"It was the past, so it can be the future. It can't change much because of Financial Fair Play, we are not allowed to do much, even with the Champions League, so we are prepared.\"",
      "Having overseen a \"disastrous\" campaign at Old Trafford, in the manager's own words, Amorim says last season is now behind him as he and his players start to look forward.",
      "\"It was important to finish the season, we needed to close that chapter,\" he said. \"It's not fully behind us because I have one row of English journalists waiting for the hard questions, so I will rest from that when we finish the tour.",
      "\"To tell you the truth, I closed that chapter, I'm excited, I'm nervous, I want to work to the next season, I don't have that feeling that I need to disconnect, I had the feeling to close the season, but now it's a new season, so I am excited at the same moment.",
      "\"So, I don't need rest, I just need to prepare for the next season.\"",
      "While predicting there will still be some more hiccups to contend with along the way, Amorim also thinks there is light at the end of the tunnel.",
      "\"It's important to stick together,\" he said. \"We are going to struggle, it's not going to be everything right away, but I can see the team improving and that's the most important thing.",
      "\"Our target, I will not tell you now. If you want a target, it is to win the first game, then we will see. We have a lot to do during this summer, we have to prepare the team.",
      "\"Again, when are you are in Man Utd, people are going to expect us to be on the top, but we have to understand the context, so I do not want the team to think of a big target, just the small target of winning the first game, then we pass to the second game.\"",
      "Meanwhile, not participating in Europe next season could be a positive for United as Amorim looks to build team unity going forward.",
      "\"I have to say that for us not to be in the Champions League could be an advantage to perform well, to perform better the games, to build that core that we need for the future,\" he explained.",
      "\"So, it is a good thing for us to take advantage of not having European games.\"",
      "Amorim has also stressed the importance of keeping Bruno Fernandes at United this summer as rumours begin to circulate regarding his future at Old Trafford.",
      "Fernandes has recently been linked with a move to Saudi Arabian side Al-Hilal, which led to Amorim stressing that United should try to keep \"one of the top players in the world\".",
      "The United boss has now reinforced this point, saying: \"You can see by the performance, the leadership, the passion he has for the games. So it is really important, especially in these kind of moments.",
      "\"You could see that in the last game. I felt that the team was without pressure; they performed quite well and everybody wanted the ball.",
      "\"The team has different moments and in different moments, Bruno [Fernandes] is the one who really wants to take responsibility.",
      "\"He should be because he is the captain, so he's really important for us and really important for what we want to build with this team.\""
