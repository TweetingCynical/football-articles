      "Alejandro Garnacho was seen giving Jamie Gittens a boost as they strolled down the tunnel of Turf Moor on Saturday. Gittens was included in Enzo Maresca's starting line-up for Chelsea's match against Burnley, replacing the Argentinian forward.",
      "However, instead of throwing a tantrum, the 21-year-old displayed his maturity with a friendly gesture as they headed back onto the pitch after half-time. Garnacho was leading the way when Gittens seemed to call out to him, playfully gesturing towards his eyes as if to say he was keeping an eye on him.",
      "Garnacho responded with a grin and a gesture of his own as they moved out of sight of the television cameras. Even though he didn't get a chance to play from the bench, Garnacho made a beeline for the away end at Turf Moor following Chelsea's 2-0 victory to show his gratitude to the fans who had travelled all the way from London.",
      "Garnacho appears to be hitting his stride on the pitch whilst building solid connections with his new teammates off it. Since his £40million switch from Manchester United this summer, Garnacho has notched two goals and provided two assists across 10 appearances in all competitions.",
      "Meanwhile, Maresca was also quick to heap praise on the youngster earlier this month. He said of Garnacho: \"He arrived here from another club where he was not training 100 per cent so his physical condition was not good.",
      "\"Slowly, slowly, now it's better. He's doing very well on the ball but he's doing very, very well off the ball. He knows that to play with us he has to be good on the ball and off the ball otherwise he's not going to play. We are very happy with him at this moment.\"",
      "It's a completely different scenario to how Garnacho was getting on with United earlier this campaign. After being frozen out under Ruben Amorim, Garnacho slammed the club's dismal 15th-place Premier League finish.",
      "He was also frustrated at losing the Europa League final to an equally-struggling Tottenham at the time. He said in May: \"It's difficult for all of us. This season has been s***. We lost the final, we didn't beat anyone in PL. It's very difficult.\"",
      "Manchester United could have done with a bit of Garnacho's magic on Monday night, as they found it tough to break down a 10-man Everton at Old Trafford. Despite having an extra man after Idrissa Gueye was sent off for slapping Michael Keane just 13 minutes in, the Reds couldn't find a way past David Moyes' resurgent side.",
      "The match was stolen by Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall, who netted the decisive goal 29 minutes in, before a Jordan Pickford masterclass denied United of any hopes of levelling. The Red Devils are also feeling the pinch of mid-season injuries, having to rely on Joshua Zirkzee for the full match due to Matheus Cunha and Benjamin Sesko being out injured.",
      "Zirkzee has found it hard to adjust to the Premier League's physicality since his move from Bologna last summer, managing only three goals in England's top tier last season. It'll be intriguing to see how Amorim copes in the coming weeks, especially with Sesko expected to be side-lined until December.",
      "There's no word yet on when Cunha will be back in action, following a knock he picked up in training last week. United's next challenge is Crystal Palace at Selhurst Park on Sunday, 30 November.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe has been completely unequivocal and unapologetic about the need for change at Manchester United since taking over in February 2024. The petrochemicals billionaire's pursuit of his one true goal has upset many over the past 20 months – including ex-players and club legends.",
      "It has been over a year since Ratcliffe decided to take Sir Alex Ferguson’s lucrative role as club ambassador away from him. Ferguson is just a drop in the ocean, set in the context of more than 450 staff redundancies, but the legendary ex-manager was a big step in terms of perception.",
      "It showed that Ratcliffe and his Ineos operation were not worried about negative PR. He is dead set on making savings wherever they can be found – and the most recent financial results showed the direction of travel in that respect, with record financial revenue of £666.5million, record commercial revenue of £333.3m and record matchday revenue of £160.3m.",
      "Ineos have employed consultants to make recommendations, and while they likely led to redundancies, the moving of London office eight years early and reduction of staff benefits and freebies, they are unlikely to have had anything to do with the chipping away of relationships with the club’s past.",
      "It is something ex-manager David Moyes hinted at ahead of Everton’s 1-0 win at Old Trafford on Monday. “The history of Manchester United was not that [one of change],” he said.",
      "“Manchester United had a great culture. They stuck with their managers, they brought through their own academy boys. They actually had some of the best characteristics of what you would want your club to have; good values.”",
      "While Moyes was addressing issues on the pitch, there is an obvious parallel happening off it, where the culture has undoubtedly changed. Much has been made of the improvements to the club’s Carrington training ground, but there have also been hints at United moving away from its roots in another sense.",
      "Club legend Norman Whiteside decided not to renew his season ticket in May after a series of issues, including the relocation of his seat, while Ferguson had to step in last year to ensure the family of Sir Matt Busby kept their seats.",
      "The price of tickets has increased and modern club legends Paul Scholes and Nicky Butt are struggling to get hold of them. Scholes revealed on Monday that he had turned to a tout to get tickets, while Butt said he had been threatened with losing his season ticket after missing a few games.",
      "“It's a very different football club to the club we knew,” Scholes said. “I don't know about you Nicky, you worked there quite recently, but I don't really know anybody there.” Butt replied: “I don't know anybody there.”",
      "Taken separately these incidents perhaps don’t add up to much, but seen together they paint a picture of the club Ineos are trying to create: a modern, efficient, money-making one. A connection to the club’s extremely successful past doesn’t fit into that picture.",
      "It seems that manager Ruben Amorim might have a sense of this becoming an issue. He reportedly wants to bring back legends like Eric Cantona in order to maintain a connection to the past and to share experiences. But with United sitting 10th in the Premier League after they failed to score past 10-man Everton for 81 minutes, he undoubtedly has bigger priorities for now.",
      "Amorim is far from certain to get his way and, as the manager of a struggling team, he could be discarded soon anyway. Ratcliffe and Ineos have shown they are 100 per cent focused on the future and have disregarded the importance of the past.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

Scholes is one of United’s greatest ever players, but he claims that so much has changed at the club since he retired that he wouldn’t know who to contact to source legitimate tickets.",
      "The midfielder made 718 appearances for United after coming through the academy. He helped the club win 25 major trophies, including 11 Premier League titles during an era of dominance under Sir Alex Ferguson, but he feels disconnected from the current era.",
      "Scholes discussed the situation with his former United team-mate Nicky Butt on The Good, the Bad & the Football podcast. Butt was also a part of the famous Class of 92 group of players, which also included the Neville brothers, Ryan Giggs and David Beckham, and has similar feelings and experiences.",
      "“It's a very different football club to the club we knew,” Scholes said. “I don't know about you Nicky, you worked there quite recently, but I don't really know anybody there.”",
      "Butt replied: “I don't know anybody there.” Scholes then said: “If I wanted a ticket, I wouldn’t know who to phone. I’ve been asked for a couple of tickets but didn’t know where to go.",
      "“I have four season tickets so we use them, my son uses them every single week. But you get people asking (for tickets). I've had a Salford lad who wants to go to the game this week, a couple of tickets. So I've had to ring a tout. Am I allowed to say that? Honestly, I know a tout. I just don’t know anybody at the club!”",
      "Butt then relayed a story in which he claims United threatened to take a season ticket away from him because it hadn’t been used frequently enough. “My lad has got the same thing, and if you don't use them three times you get them taken off you,” he said.",
      "“I've had an email saying ‘you're having your ticket taken off you’. So I rang them up and said ‘can I speak to somebody about this please?’ And it’s just a switchboard, so they might not be a football fan, and they go ‘who am I speaking to please?’, and I go ‘Nicky Butt’ and they go, ‘OK, well who's that?’ I didn’t say it but I feel like saying ‘I played like 450 games for this club and I won about seven titles’ but it is a different world. I wouldn’t know where to go.”",
      "“I'm not complaining about that,” he said. “That's just the way it is and the way it happens. Just because you played for the club, you're not entitled to stuff.”",
      "An exasperated Paddy McGuinness responded: “Hang on a minute! The amount of games you played, your life long service as a player for United, you gave everything to the club.”",
      "Scholes replied: “Yeah but we only played for them. You're going back 13 years now for the last time I played. We don't mind paying for them, we just don't know who to ring because the club is just different, it's a different football club.”",

      "Manchester United legend Paul Scholes and Nicky Butt have lifted the lid on a secret meeting where they were asked to weigh in on potential signings for the club. The former midfield maestros revealed the consultation took place while Ryan Giggs was serving as caretaker boss during the 2013/14 campaign following the departure of David Moyes.",
      "The Red Devils were in the midst of a major overhaul following Sir Alex Ferguson's retirement, with the club pursuing high-profile acquisitions in an effort to reclaim their position among the Premier League's elite. Against this backdrop, then-executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward turned to Scholes and Butt for their input, presenting the duo with a shortlist of four potential recruits.",
      "During an appearance on The Good, The Bad and The Football podcast, the United stalwarts detailed how that discussion with Woodward ultimately paved the way for Paul Pogba's homecoming. Butt recalled: \"I just remember Ryan [Giggs] took control of the club for four or five or six games at the end of the season...",
      "\"Then me and Scholesy did it [the meeting] with him and Phil as well. And I remember obviously they were looking for the right manager to come in and take the job, so they obviously needed targets to go and get in the summer.",
      "\"So I had left the training ground and got called back, and there was a meeting with myself, Scholesy, Ryan, and Ed Woodward, and I think Ed Woodward was on a Zoom call; it wasn't so much face-to-face, I think he was in London, and it was like, 'Who would you get?'",
      "\"And he gave us a list of midfielders, I know Pogba was one, Kroos weren't you saying? Fabregas might've been one.\"",
      "Scholes added: \"I think [Cesc] Fabregas might've been one as well, I think even [Luka] Modric might've been one as well.\"",
      "Butt continued: \"I remember we were all discussing pros and cons to them all, and the end of the conversation was, 'go for both of them, [Toni] Kroos and Pogba, because we're Man United and we need to get back to the top'.",
      "\"And if you get one, it's like yin and yang, we mentioned it a while ago, about if you get centre-backs, with Harry Maguire, and you need a footballing player next to him, it's a bit of the same with midfielders.",
      "\"We're not all the same, and you need a bit to complement each other, and that was how it was left, and then they went all-out for Pogba.\"",
      "United brought Pogba back to Old Trafford in August 2016, sealing a transfer from Juventus that could have totalled £93million with all the additional clauses. The France international featured 233 times for the Red Devils during his second spell, netting 39 goals and providing 51 assists.",
      "He then left on a free transfer in 2022. Pogba's career is often viewed through different lenses, with some recalling the magic he could weave, while others feel he never consistently lived up to his hefty price tag.",
      "The inclusion of Toni Kroos, Luka Modric, or Cesc Fabregas in the team might have altered his fate, with the first two continuing to shine at Real Madrid for many more years, while the latter had a stint back in England with Chelsea, before playing in France and then Italy.",

      "Manchester United have been encouraged to pursue a deal for Jean-Philippe Mateta, with Bacary Sagna claiming a move for the Crystal Palace striker makes perfect sense.",
      "The Red Devils were linked with the Frenchman back in the summer before signing Benjamin Sesko from RB Leipzig for big money. But despite spending over £200million in the summer on an overhaul of their attack - and some promising early signs from the likes of Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha - United are still being linked with another striker.",
      "While it remains to be seen if Ruben Amorim and the Old Trafford hierarchy would like another out and out No 9 to compete with Sesko, whispers of interest in Mateta refuse to go away.",
      "And Sagna feels that moving for Mateta, a proven goalscorer at Premier League level, would be a no-brainer as Crystal Palace struggle to tie their talisman down to a new deal.",
      "“It would make sense if Jean-Philippe Mateta went to Manchester United,” the former Arsenal defender told Oddspedia. “They don’t really have a No 9 who is tall, can hold the ball and can get on the end of crosses.",
      "“It could be difficult for him as a new player coming into a club where there are a lot of new players and transferring his skills across from Crystal Palace, but a move to Old Trafford would be good for him and the club.",
      "“It will also be difficult for Palace to keep hold of him, and it’s the right moment for him to move if he wants the test of playing for one of the biggest teams in the Premier League. He’s not a young player anymore and it might be one of the last moves of his career, so he will probably push for it if the opportunity arises.”",
      "Sagna's comments come less than 24 hours after it emerged talks between Mateta and Crystal Palace over a new contract are at a standstill.",
      "The Standard have confirmed that Palace will need to 'significantly increase' their current offer if they are to persuade Mateta to stay at Selhurst Park, with the striker - whose current deal expires in 2027 - dreaming of a move to an elite club.",

      "Despite Idrissa Gueye getting sent off inside 14 minutes, the visitors triumphed thanks to Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall's stunning strike. And it was Moyes's first win at Old Trafford as a visiting boss in 18 attempts.",
      "But Pickford reckons Moyes should thanks himself for the stunning result - after telling his players before kick off how Everton needed to win at United to be considered a \"proper team\".",
      "Pickford said: \"The manager said before the game, 'you want to be a proper team, you want to push up the table, tonight's the time to go and stamp your authority on it and get a result'. We know it's not as easy as that, but we gave what the gaffer wanted and we got our rewards.",
      "\"It's a great win, great performance. Some good football as well, but suffering at times as a team. If you’re suffering the right way, you get results.",
      "\"Football's weird because Manchester United are in form at the minute. If they had won they would have been top four - and everyone's talking about them.",
      "\"We have to look at ourselves, and we've got to put our performance on and not focus on how well United are doing, because once we put our performance in and our shift we can get results.\"",

      "Joshua Zirkzee has received a less-than-glowing assessment from Michael Owen after his performance against Everton. Zirkzee was handed his first start of the Premier League season by Manchester United on Monday but it did not go to plan for the Dutch striker or his side in a 1-0 defeat.",
      "Zirkzee has been stuck on the substitutes’ bench this season, with Ruben Amorim preferring to start summer signings Matheus Cunha or Benjamin Sesko up front. But with Sesko out injured and Cunha pulling out last-minute due to a knock in training, Amorim had little option but to trust Zirkzee against Everton.",
      "The Toffees were reduced to 10 men after just 13 minutes when Idrissa Gueye was sent off for slapping his team-mate Michael Keane. But United couldn’t take advantage, with Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall’s goal earning the away side all three points as Everton repelled pressure.",
      "United dominated the ball and had 25 shots, but couldn’t find a way past Jordan Pickford, who made an impressive late save to keep out Zirkzee’s header. The 24-year-old is yet to score or assist in six appearances this season and Owen has suggested he doesn’t have a future at the club.",
      "“I can’t watch him and get excited, I must admit,” Owen told Premier League Productions. “Cunha missing today was a big blow. He was the closest to scoring for Man United but they are almost resorting to playing like this with hopeful crosses because he’s in there.",
      "“If you have Cunha playing, a different profile of player, you probably don’t go knocking crosses in all game. It’s not how Manchester United want to play and I always think if you start lumping the ball it becomes desperation.",
      "“One or two landed on Zirkzee’s head but the way Man United are playing prior to tonight, it’s not the right profile of player, he doesn’t excite me at all.”",
      "Zirkzee joined United for £36million from Bologna in July 2024. He has managed just seven goals and three assists in 55 appearances for the club since then and has been strongly linked with a move away from Old Trafford in 2026.",
      "The arrivals of Sesko, Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo for over £200m in the summer has seen Zirkzee relegated in the pecking order, with United’s exit at the hands of Grimsby in the Carabao Cup and their lack of European football giving him even fewer opportunities to play.",
      "However, with Sesko currently injured after being forced off in the 2-2 draw with Tottenham earlier this month and Mbeumo heading to the Africa Cup of Nations next month along with Noussair Mazraoui and Amad Diallo, Amorim may have to deny Zirkzee a move away in the January transfer window and use him more often.",

      "There are few more precarious jobs than that of a football manager. Four Premier League bosses have already been sacked this season as clubs seek to turn around their fortunes.",
      "Vitor Pereira, Graham Potter, Nuno Espirito Santo and Ange Postecoglou have all been given their marching orders during the campaign. Santo is already back in this division, providing a very vivid illustration of the managerial merry-go-round.",
      "With just 12 games played this season, it's not unthinkable that more coaches could find themselves on the chopping block before the end of 2025/26. More than one may already have a bead of sweat on their brow in concern over the position.",
      "A lucky or qualified few will not have thought about the prospect of being sacked and have zero fear of their futures being pulled out from underneath them. Things change quickly in the Premier League.",
      "Arsenal are flying high at the top of the Premier League, and the Gunners wouldn't dream of sacking Mikel Arteta as he looks on course to finally bring a title to the Emirates. Missing out again could leave food for thought, but the Spaniard is overseeing an impressive job in north London.",
      "Pep Guardiola is a figure likely to decide his own future at Manchester City, while Oliver Glasner is on course for another strong season after leading Crystal Palace to the FA Cup last term. The latter is much more likely to depart of his own accord.",
      "After an uncertain start, Unai Emery has guided Aston Villa into fourth, while Chelsea won't be quick to part ways with Enzo Maresca, with the club in second in the Premier League.",
      "Bournemouth ’s Andoni Iraola is working wonders after a summer of sales and Sunderland boss Regis Le Bris is enjoying an exciting season with newly-promoted Sunderland. No danger of the sack there.",
      "Likewise, Fabian Hurzeler is guiding Brighton well with the Seagulls just four points from Chelsea in the Premier League. Meanwhile, Sean Dyche's win over Liverpool will see him in good standing as Nottingham Forest 's third boss of the season.",
      "Eddie Howe is in no danger of being sacked despite the club sitting 14th. If that's where they stay, questions could be asked of his ability to manage domestic and Champions League football come the end of the season.",
      "Scott Parker and David Moyes remain good fits for Burnley and Everton respectively, and shouldn't be looking over their shoulder other than after any devastating form which dramatically pushes their teams to relegation. Likewise, Keith Andrews has enjoyed a good start at Brentford, but in his first role in the top job needs to continue to prove himself.",
      "Fulham want to tie Marco Silva down to a new deal before the end of the year, but the Portuguese coach has yet to commit. The Cottagers' season has not been a roaring success, and it will be interesting to see what transpires if that continues.",
      "Nuno Espirito Santo appears to have found his feet at West Ham, while Rob Edwards has barely had time to sit down at Wolves. Both will know their employers can be ruthless.",
      "Arne Slot is not on the verge of being sacked after winning the league last year, but is undoubtedly under a degree of pressure after six defeats in seven Premier League outings. The Dutchman is shouldering the blame for Liverpool's dramatic fall in form.",
      "Tottenham boss Thomas Frank has helped Spurs to a position much higher than last year's 17th position. Defeat to Arsenal and some subpar performances have not borne much in the way of affection from fans, but club owners, the Lewis family, are clear on Frank’s appointment being part of a long-term project.",
      "Manchester United boss Ruben Amorim needs to deliver this season, with no European football. The Portuguese coach will be expected to return the Red Devils to a truly competitive team and they are still producing performances of varying quality.",
      "Daniel Farke remains the bookies' favourite for the sack. The Leeds boss saw speculation over his future in the summer, having never kept a team in the Premier League. Three defeats in a row leaves the Yorkshire club in the relegation zone.",

      "Michael Owen once spent a fortune on a street of new houses for his family after kickstarting his professional football career. Born in Chester and raised in nearby Hawarden, Owen broke through the ranks of the Liverpool academy in 1996 before enjoying an emphatic eight-year tenure at Anfield.",
      "And thanks to his success early on, the now 45-year-old was in a financial position to splash the cash on new houses for his family in the area he grew up. Owen, speaking to Reece Mennie on his podcast, said: \"I bought a lot of houses right at the outset when I first came into a bit of money for my family.",
      "\"So it was all news at the time, but I bought a street of new houses, which I bought when I was about 19. 26 years later, my mum and dad live in the first one, my brother in the next one, my brother in the next one, my sister in the next one. So we've got a full street in the village that we were brought up in, which was lovely to do.\"",
      "As per a report from The Guardian back in 2001, Owen spent around £750,000 to home his nearest and dearest alongside one another - roughly three months' wages at the time. However, it is said that Owen didn't take up tenure at a property on the street himself, instead, opting to settle a mile down the road in a detached house.",
      "Just the fourth Englishman to win the Ballon d'Or, Owen enjoyed an incredible career with Liverpool between 1996 and 2004, racking up 158 goals and 51 assists across 297 appearances. With the Reds, he also won an FA Cup, a pair of League Cups, a Community Shield, a UEFA Cup and a UEFA Super Cup before making the move to Real Madrid in an £8million deal.",
      "However, his time at the Bernabeu was less than fruitful, making 45 appearances over the course of a year before returning to English soil to play for Newcastle United. After spending four years at St James' Park, Owen transferred to Liverpool's bitter rivals, Manchester United.",
      "There, he won the Premier League in 2009/10, as well as adding another League Cup and Community Shield to his trophy cabinet. After spending three years with the Red Devils, Owen signed for Stoke City in 2012, lasting just one season with the Potters before hanging up his boots.",
      "Owen also achieved 89 caps for England on the world stage as part of the nation's 'Golden Generation', but ultimately failed to win a major honour with the Three Lions. It comes as Owen was spotted in unrecognisable fashion at his daughter's birthday bash earlier this month.",
      "The former forward donned Hulk Hogan fancy dress attire as he celebrated his youngest daughter's 18th, wearing a one-piece costume with inflated muscles which read 'Hulkamania' across the chest. He also wore an over-the-top fake moustache, a blonde wig and a bandana to tie the piece together.",
      "Also spotted at the do was his eldest daughter and former Love Island star, Gemma, who opted to dress as a flapper girl in a stunning metallic dress, complete with long black satin gloves, a pearl necklace and a rhinestone headband.",
      "Owen's wife, Louise, meanwhile, sported a look of Audrey Hepburn from Breakfast at Tiffany's. She wore an elegant black dress with long black gloves and dark sunglasses.",
      "The couple's son, James, was dressed as a jockey, while birthday girl Emily stole the show in a Marylin Monroe costume.",

I think we lacked maybe the urgency to score the goals, to create the chances, and then you know, against a team like Everton, who drops back and who are really strong in the air, it's going to be quite difficult.

      "Gary Neville accused Luke Shaw of 'ambling' through Manchester United's crushing home defeat to Everton. But what he should have said was that Shaw has ambled through most of his United career. If there is a great survivor at Old Trafford - it has to be Shaw.",
      "Not least because the defender has spent almost a dozen seasons at United since joining them from Southampton in 2014. But has made just 210 league appearances in that time. Which begs the question, what has Shaw actually done to justify outstaying his welcome in the red half of Manchester?",
      "\"You have Shaw, (Leny) Yoro and (Matthijs) De Ligt behind the ball. Shaw is getting forward more, but he's ambling forward, let's be clear, \" raged Neville.",
      "\"He's been bugging me for the last 20 minutes. He's ambling, you can't do that. He should be running forward every single time, I don't care. Yoro, I have a little bit more sympathy for.",
      "\"But Shaw? That's a waste of time. I don't care. It's a waste of time. It's not conning anybody. I'm not having it.\"",
      "Neville could have picked on any one of United's side for criticism during the Monday night madness. Joshua Zirkzee, Yoro, Patrick Dorgu or Casemiro would have been top of my list. The worst of a very bad bunch.",
      "But the fact Neville targeted Shaw is relevant, because the left back sums up the era of mediocrity United have been stuck in this past decade.",
      "Ruben Amorim is Shaw's ninth different manager at United. And he has fallen into the same trap most of his predecessors did - he thinks Shaw can contribute something significant to the team.",
      "Shaw has had his problems at United. He's had serious injuries, loss of form and serious criticism from various managers. But all of the above hasn't prevented him from picking up new contracts along the way. Erik ten Hag gave him his last one, back in 2023. One which will keep Shaw in the manner in which he has become accustomed at Old Trafford until June 2027, the cusp of his 32nd birthday.",
      "United bosses have been guilty of this countless times with numerous stars.",
      "Gifting them deals which catapult them into the comfort zone of being able to pocket huge wages, in return for cruising through towards the end of their careers.",

      "The visitors were down to 10-men inside the opening quarter of an hour after Idrissa Gueye was sent off for going head-to-head with his own teammate, Michael Keane. A few moments later, the former Chelsea midfielder fired Everton in front with a superb effort from the edge of the box.",
      "United enjoyed the lion's share of possession for the remainder of the match, but they couldn't break down the Toffees' defence. Neville grew audibly frustrated as his old club failed to find a leveller, and by the 60-minute mark, Bolasie had had enough.",
      "The former Everton winger criticised Neville for 'giggling all over the microphone' and believing he's the 'second coming of Guardiola'. On X, previously known as Twitter, Bolasie posted: \"I'm watching this game on mute [crying with laughter emoji].",
      "\"I respect opinions but not when he's giggling all over the mic thinking he's the second coming of Guardiola, allow it... great player but the tactics give it a rest laaaad.\"",
      "Even a Liverpool supporter, @LFCANONYMOUS27, leapt to Bolasie's defence, writing: \"Everyone talking about his pl titles mind you he said nothing about him as a player and we all know how it ended when he tried to play manager.\"",
      "Meanwhile, an Arsenal fan, @snowflake_tv, posted: \"I donno why you guys hate him that much. He is one of the greatest (if not the greatest) pundits today.",

      "\"You can't go from the fight that they showed in certain games to that. It just erodes confidence, it erodes trust. We're trying to build a trust in a manager, we're trying to build a trust in a team.",
      "\"The fans booed collectively at the end. It was loud, and rightly so. That was a really poor performance. It's almost as if you've gone sort of like two or three steps forward, everyone's feeling a little bit better about themselves, and you've just gone back to the start again.",

      "Manchester United were handed a fresh setback on their return from the international break when they faced off with Everton at Old Trafford. Ruben Amorim's side had seemingly clicked in terms of results, putting together a string of three victories, before two draws to kickstart an unbeaten run.",
      "That's despite an early red card for Idrissa Gueye, who was sent off for a slap to Michael Keane in the opening stages of the match. However, Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall's strike put Everton into the lead, posing a problem that Man United simply had no answer to.",
      "While it was a defeat for United that could cause plenty of concern, there was a sign of a bright future being shown on the bench. In all the chaos of the match unfolding at Old Trafford, there was a place for academy star Shea Lacey on the bench and in the matchday squad for the first time.",
      "The England under-20s international has been tipped for big things and is the latest prospect from the youth ranks who could help to make an impact. That may be especially important in the coming weeks, with AFCON resulting in Bryan Mbeumo and Amad leaving the squad to join up with their nations for the tournament.",
      "The likes of Lacey and Jack Fletcher could be crucial in replacing those who will be gone, showing reliance on the academy to help in those tough times. That's despite Moyes claiming that Man United have moved away from that identity, with a mention for Sir Alex Ferguson, too.",
      "Speaking before the clash, he told the press: \"The history of Manchester United was not [one of change]. Manchester United had a great culture. They stuck with their managers; they brought through their own academy boys. They actually had some of the best characteristics of what you would want your club to have: good values.",
      "“Sir Alex had great values at Manchester United and, over the years, those values he established needed some time to come through as well. It was always a club with brilliant values, with an understanding about bringing their young players through and developing them in the right way.”",
      "While some of that can be aimed at Man United in recent years, the same cannot be said of how Amorim's tenure is going at the club. There hasn't been the excessive change previously seen, while it's clear just how important it is for the manager to support the youth players properly.",
      "Lacey and Fletcher may be the latest examples, with Amorim putting plenty of praise on the former, as he said before the clash with Everton: \"I'm really happy with him. I think he struggled a little bit with injuries, they did a very good job balancing his body, you can sense that he can manage more load during training.",
      "\"He has a lot of talent, but when they come here, they can sense the speed is completely different, so they need to spend more time with us to be prepared, because our trainings are hard, at Premier League games, with the pressure it's harder, so they need to be ready.\"",
      "It's clear that Amorim is conscious of the development it takes with the Man United academy stars to not only give them opportunities, but to have them ease their way into senior football in the right way. That much was made even clearer when he reflected on Chido Obi's situation.",
      "The young striker played seven times in the Premier League last season, but is yet to be named in a matchday squad this season. Amorim reflected on that when he said: \"Yeah, of course [Obi can step up], he played last year. I think it was too soon, we didn't have a team. That we can put a young kid with 16, that he will not struggle, or will struggle a little bit, was completely necessary to do that.",
      "\"The perfect conditions. We have the opportunity and we seek that opportunity for the kids, so he's one of the guys, but I think he started too soon. And sometimes it's hard to deal with that, with the kids, because they think that I'm already here. No, you are here for necessity and we need to be careful also with that.\"",
      "While Man United have been accused of moving away from their identity in the past, Amorim is clearly putting a lot of time and thought into how the youngsters can be used. That development plan could be crucial in the short-term to deal with absences, while in the long-term, it could get the club back where they want to be.",

      "It was just about the worst start to an away game at Old Trafford you could imagine. With just 13 minutes on the clock, Everton found themselves down to 10 men and in apparent disarray after Idrissa Gueye lost his head and was shown a red card in bizarre circumstances.",
      "It all started with a run-of-the-mill misunderstanding. Gueye picked up the ball inside his own penalty area and tried to pass to his team-mate Michael Keane, who was not on the same wave length. The stray pass allowed Manchester United captain Bruno Fernandes a free shot at goal, which whistled narrowly wide.",
      "Cue shouting from Jordan Pickford and an inquest between the defenders. But that's when things went beyond the normal. Keane and Gueye squared up to each other, with some shoving before the midfielder aimed a little slap at his towering team-mate.",
      "It was just the third time in Premier League history that a player had been dismissed for fighting with a teammate - and the first in 17 years. Gueye joins Ricardo Fuller (Stoke, 2008) and Lee Bowyer and Kieron Dyer (Newcastle, 2005) in an unwanted section of the league's annals.",
      "Remarkably, though, Everton did not suffer the same fate as Stoke and Newcastle, who both unsurprisingly lost their matches on that occasion. David Moyes' side appeared galvanised by the red card on Monday night and dug deep to frustrate an uninspired United.",
      "Pickford made some crucial saves, denying Joshua Zirkzee with a fantastic late stop, to give Everton a hard-fought 1-0 win, courtesy of Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall's stunning solo effort in the 29th minute.",
      "There is a sting in the tail for the Toffees, though, who will now be without Gueye for a long time. The midfielder has been handed an automatic three-match suspension for violent conduct, which will rule him out of matches against Newcastle, Bournemouth and Nottingham Forest.",
      "Gueye is also part of the Senegal squad which will compete at the Africa Cup of Nations next month, meaning he might not play again for Everton for 10 matches. Senegal's first match is on December 23 and the tournament runs until January 18. Clubs are supposed to release their players for international duty two weeks before the tournament, meaning Gueye could be unavailable for Everton's trip to Stamford Bridge to face Chelsea on December 13, when his suspension expires.",
      "\"The reaction from the lads after it was unbelievable, top tier. We could've easily crumbled, gone in on ourselves and lost the game comfortably, but it probably made us grow even more as a team.",
      "\"The manager just said he would deal with the situation another time and it was just about keeping to the plan that we had. He just wanted us to continue what we were doing and focus on the things we can change.\"",
      "Gueye posted an apology on social media on Tuesday morning. It read: “I want to apologise first to my teammate Michael Keane. I take full responsibility for my reaction.",
      "“I also apologise to my teammates, the staff, the fans and the club. What happened does not reflect who I am or the values I stand for. Emotions can run high, but nothing justifies such behaviour. I'll make sure it never happens again.\"",
      "Everton manager Moyes claimed victory over his former club United and felt that Gueye was unlucky to be sent off for what he felt was an overblown moment. He said: “I like my players fighting each other, if someone didn’t do the right action. If you want that toughness and resilience to get a result, you want someone to act on it.",
      "“If nothing happened [no red card], I don’t think anyone in the stadium would have been surprised. I thought the referee could have taken a bit longer to think about it. I was told that [by] the rules of the game that if you slap your own player, you could be in trouble.",
      "“I’m disappointed we got the sending off. But we’ve all been footballers, we get angry with our teammates. He’s apologised for the sending off, he’s praised the players and thanked them for it and apologised.”",
      "United were without the injured duo of Benjamin Sesko and Matheus Cunha and it showed at Old Trafford as they toiled for 81 minutes against Everton's 10 men. United had 69 per cent of the ball and fired in 25 shots at Pickford's goal without finding the back of the net.",
      "It left United manager Ruben Amorim to choose a surprising line on the Gueye red card. He said: \"Fighting is not a bad thing. Fighting doesn't mean that they don't like each other.",
      "\"Fighting is that you lose the ball and 'I will fight you because we will suffer a goal'. I hope my players, when they lose the ball, fight each other.\"",
      "Ultimately, because his team won, Gueye's moment of madness won't be remembered as negatively as those who came before him. But his suspension means Everton will have to do without his services for a long time.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Manchester United fans have all been left saying the same thing after the Red Devils lost 1-0 to a 10-man Everton outfit. Idrissa Gueye was dismissed in extraordinary circumstances early in the match after slapping team-mate Michael Keane in the face, leaving Everton to play a man down for almost the entire game.",
      "However, despite the advantage, Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall's stunning right-footed shot into the top corner sealed the win for the Toffees at Old Trafford, completing a shock result on Monday night. Everton had not beaten United at Old Trafford since 2013 and despite Ruben Amorim's side pushing for an equaliser through Bryan Mbeumo and Joshua Zirkzee, Jordan Pickford was able to keep a clean sheet and secure the famous win.",
      "In fact, it was the goal that spurred life into United, who were lacklustre up to that point. Zirkzee, widely touted to leave the club next year, was given the chance up front in the absence of Benjamin Sesko and Matheus Cunha, but was unable to make the most of his opportunity with the United midfield struggling to create chances for their striker.",
      "The immediate reaction from United fans on social media has been fierce, with fans branding the loss as \"embarrassing\", with others revealing their disbelief at the result.",
      "\"Man Utd was embarrassing last night. The people involved in that squad should be ashamed of themselves. At home? A performance like that?\" questioned one on X.",
      "\"Man Utd 0 - 1 Everton. Outperformed before the red card. Outperformed against 10 men. I have no words for what I just witnessed. Embarrassing,\" wrote another.",
      "\"When you already have a player advantage too. Embarrassing man,\" said a third supporter.",
      "Coincidentally, it was also exactly one year since Amorim's first match in charge of United, with the pressure building on the Portuguese manager's job.",
      "The result leaves United in 10th place after 12 games and means they have not won a Premier League game since their 4-2 victory against Brighton at Old Trafford last month.",
      "Amorim has a tough test against Crystal Palace away from home this weekend, before encounters with West Ham, Wolves, Bournemouth and Aston Villa before Christmas.",

      "The forward has enjoyed a promising start to life at Camp Nou and has provided six goals and nine assists in 16 matches for the Catalan giants. The England international has been particularly potent in the Champions League, scoring four goals and adding two assists in the competition.",
      "Rashford's return to British shores comes in Europe's premier tournament, with Barca making the trip to west London to face Chelsea. The 28-year-old's situation is a far cry from what started developing 12 months ago, when the United academy product found himself struggling to gel with new boss Ruben Amorim.",
      "Rashford was soon left outside of matchday squads and looking for a new club before landing his dream move to Barca.",
      "And Flick believes Barcelona have fostered a perfect environment and system in which Rashford can thrive - unlike his previous club. The German coach also confirmed Rashford is fit to play against Chelsea after a bout of flu. ”I’m very happy for Marcus,\" said Flick.",
      "\"He’s back from a cold and he’s fine; I’ll decide tomorrow whether he starts or comes off the bench. But I’m happy to have him in the team, playing for Barca.",
      "“I’ve followed him throughout his career and I’ve always been impressed by his quality and what he’s capable of in the box, and he’s showing that in Barcelona. This change for him, in a new style of football, in Barcelona, with the great weather…",
      "\"For me, it’s incredible to see how he’s always smiling. It’s the atmosphere we have here, and it’s very good for him.\"",
      "Flick was also forced to defend Barcelona's role in recent injuries. Problems are said to have been faced by a series of players, including Raphinha, Lamine Yamal, Gavi and Alejandro Balde.",
      "“I don’t read much, but I have read about the injuries that have come out,\" said Flick. What I can say is that I’m not angry with our medical staff; we have a fantastic staff with a lot of experience. Regarding Raphinha, in this situation we’ve made mistakes, we all make them, but that’s normal, it’s human. Even so, we trust everyone on our staff. The rest is just noise.",
      "“Step by step with Rafa. For me, the important thing is that he’s back. We’ll decide on the minutes and how much he’ll play later. He’s suffered an injury twice, and that’s not good at this stage, so we’ll be careful. I’m very happy he’s back because, as soon as he played on Saturday, we saw the difference: his dynamism, he created space, and I’m very happy to have him back.”",

      "Hundreds of Manchester United fans were left fuming ahead of the side's clash with Everton last night (November 24) after facing huge delays entering Old Trafford. Questions are now being raised over the stewarding of the turnstiles at the ground.",
      "Some supporters have revealed they missed the start of the Premier League game against the Toffees. It is understood delays were partly caused by the length of searches conducted by stewards, as well as a shift to NFC (Near Field Communication) technology to gain entry to the stadium.",
      "There were widespread reports of issues with fans entering the Stretford End.",
      "\"United need to do better for their fans. It has been like this all season when trying to get into the Stretford End and all around Old Trafford,\" a fan posted on social media. Another supporter described the delay as a \"s******.\"",
      "Season ticket holder Graham Barton has complained to United about the length of the queues in the past, but he believed Monday's delay was the worst he has encountered.",
      "\"That has slowed it down a little bit, but the problem is, I'm W11, you have four turnstiles, and there are barriers dividing you up as you queue up. And you've got six stewards searching, and they're usually quite slow. That makes a massive queue, and by the time the queue gets to the wall, the chief steward tells them to search quicker, so the searches aren't adequate anyway, and there's a massive queue.\"",
      "Barton continued: \"It's a safety risk because you don't need anything to get to that point. When I got there, it was the longest the queue had ever been, it went right back to the wall. It was about 20ft along the wall. I took the photos when I got there and spoke to one of the top stewards about it.",
      "\"I didn't like his attitude. He said it wasn't a problem, and I said I'm not comfortable standing in the queue. Think of the Manchester bombing. What if someone wanted to blow someone up here? There were hundreds of people. Then he said it's the turnstiles being slow, not the search time.",
      "\"I have complained about the length of the queues before to the stewards, also when the club sent one of the surveys to season ticket holders, I put down that queuing was an issue.\"",
      "The MEN contacted United for a response to supporter concerns about turnstile delays. A Manchester United spokesperson said: \"We understand the frustration of fans caught in queues close to kick-off and we are constantly looking for ways to improve flows, including deploying additional stewarding staff to help deal with any issues causing hold-ups at turnstiles.",
      "\"However, in general, digital ticketing has been working well and there were no systemic problems reported last night. The best way to avoid queues is to arrive at the stadium in plenty of time before kick-off, although we do appreciate that this can be more difficult for midweek games, and that many fans were affected by traffic congestion around the ground last night.\"",
      "United were also criticised by fans who encountered problems at the turnstiles before the season's opening fixture against Arsenal. The club rolled out a new ticketing system for every supporter for 2025/26, meaning fans now enter Old Trafford using NFC technology.",
      "All tickets are digital on a smartphone and downloaded to a device's wallet. The tickets are scanned to gain entry at the turnstiles, but mass confusion occurred before the Arsenal game when hundreds of supporters could not gain entry, and they were sent to the ticketing office by unprepared stewards.",
      "The MEN were told some stewards on the turnstiles sent fans to the ticketing office because they did not know the solution to the problem, forcing fans to miss the start of the game.",
      "One fan described the Arsenal delays as a \"disgrace\" while another supporter revealed their 77-year-old mother, a platinum season ticket holder, missed the game due to the changes.",

Macaulay will oversee the senior scouts and report back to Christopher Vivell, who joined United on a temporary basis last year and was appointed permanently as the director of recruitment in February.",
      "Vivell oversees the club's recruitment network and reports to the director of football, Jason Wilcox. Vivell and Macaulay worked together at Chelsea between 2022 and 2023, with the former serving as technical director at Stamford Bridge and the latter worked as head of scouting.",
      "In the summer, club sources said the search for a new head of senior scouting was part of the ongoing restructuring and modernisation of the scouting network at Old Trafford. Vivell has streamlined the scouting network but has retained 'significant human scouting and analytical capabilities', particularly focused on emerging talent, with data support.",
      "Macaulay was available to move to Manchester after leaving West Ham in October. He has followed Graham Potter throughout his career, previously working at Swedish club Ostersunds, Swansea City and Brighton, before following Potter to Chelsea and, more recently, West Ham. He spent six years as Ostersunds’ chief analyst, where he first worked with Potter.",
      "Macaulay worked as chief scout for Swansea and served as Brighton's head of scouting during a period in which the Seagulls used their data model to sign Moises Caicedo, Kaoru Mitoma, Marc Cucurella and Leandro Trossard. Since Ineos invested in the club, there has been increased activity in markets outside of Europe.",
      "Sekou Kone was signed from Mali in 2024, Diego Leon arrived from Paraguay this summer and United have struck a preliminary agreement to sign Colombian teenager Cristian Orozco. Sir Jim Ratcliffe has invested in United's data department, notably hiring Michael Sansoni as director of data in the summer.

      "But why did the players deliver such a shocking performance? \"We talk about this a lot of times,\" Amorim said. \"I know which point we are in the moment. I have that feeling during this run. I always talk about that.",
      "\"We are not there, not even near the point that we should be to fight for the best positions in the league. We have a lot to do and we need to be perfect to win. We were not perfect today.\"",
      "United should not need to be \"perfect\" to beat a 10-man Everton at Old Trafford. The decision to send off Idrissa Gana Gueye handed United a huge advantage with 77 minutes remaining, but Everton grew in belief they would claim a victory with every minute after Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall's goal.",
      "Everton did not look like a side missing a player on the pitch. United played into their hands, playing crosses into the box, which was illogical given the height of Everton's backline.",
      "United could not control the game, despite having the advantage of an extra man, and the decision to leave three centre-backs on the pitch didn't make sense. It felt like Amorim was being stubborn because if he had changed his system in an attempt to get back into the game there would be no going back.",
      "Everyone would have said, 'if you can change your system against Everton, why haven't you previously?' Amorim stuck by his system when logic said the team needed to be tweaked.",
      "Kobbie Mainoo was introduced for Casemiro just before the hour mark, but bringing off Leny Yoro for the midfielder would have given United a better chance of gaining control.",
      "There was no need to have Yoro, Matthijs de Ligt and Luke Shaw on the pitch for the entire game when United desperately needed a goal. De Ligt missed a chance in added time, but he is a defender and cannot be blamed.",
      "Yoro had a game to forget, failing to commit to the challenge before Dewsbury-Hall opened the scoring in the 29th minute, and he was the logical candidate to be removed for a midfielder.",
      "Amorim is risk-averse and should have played with three midfielders. Shea Lacey was the only attacking option on the bench once the changes had been made, but having an extra midfielder would have helped a lot.",
      "It would have allowed United to make their extra man advantage count, move the ball with purpose and make Everton's players tired. Then an opening likely would have emerged.",
      "Instead, crosses were played into the box, and Joshua Zirkzee was asked to find an equaliser with his head. Zirkzee drew a great save from Jordan Pickford, but he is not a competent goalscorer.",
      "Amorim was heaped with praise during an excellent October after overseeing wins against Sunderland, Liverpool and Brighton, but it's fair to criticise the United boss after such a shocking defeat.",
      "The 40-year-old's in-game management against a team with 10 men was poor. Amorim overlooked a potential solution - bringing on Mainoo for Yoro - because he wanted to continue with three at the back.",
      "Everton had only claimed a single victory in 32 years at Old Trafford in the Premier League, while David Moyes had failed to win at the ground in 17 attempts as a visiting manager. The odds were further stacked against Everton when Gana Gueye slapped his own teammate.",
      "\"It's been difficult to win here over the years, but over the recent seasons, I've felt I've come close,\" said Moyes during his press conference. \"But if you said I would get a result with 10 men, when it was 0-0, I would have said that would be really tough. It was a brilliant performance.\"",
      "United's defeat is made worse by the opportunity they had to climb into the Champions League places. The Reds would have moved to fifth position at the least if they had won against Everton.",
      "Amorim must inspire a response next weekend against Crystal Palace. He believes that he is a \"better manager\" after learning from last season, but he is still refusing to adapt.",

      "Ruben Amorim believes Manchester United deserved to lose against Everton. Amorim hit out at the lack of \"intensity\" during his press conference and admitted his side \"didn't play well\".",
      "United were undefeated in five Premier League games before facing Everton and were handed a huge advantage when Idrissa Gueye was sent off for slapping teammate Michael Keane.",
      "Everton opened the scoring through Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall in the 29th minute. United were outplayed in the first half, despite having an extra player on the pitch, and Amorim had made three changes before the hour mark in an attempt to spark a response from his players.",
      "United struggled to break Everton down in the closing stages. Jordan Pickford made a decent save to deny Joshua Zirkzee, but the Toffees were able to see out the game with just 10 men.",
      "Amorim said: \"Frustration, disappointment about the way we played the game. They were the better team, with 11 they defend really well for 70 minutes with 10 men. I think we deserved to lose.",
      "\"We didn’t play well, we didn’t play with the right intensity. We talk about this a lot [about what went wrong], I know which point we are at the moment, I have that feeling during this run.",
      "\"We are not there, not even near the point we should be to fight for the best positions in the league. We need to be perfect to win games and we were not.\"",
      "Discussing whether some of his players did not show the intensity he wants, Amorim responded: \"We need to find a way, I don’t like to say we can, we show and then it is one game by week.",
      "\"It is not back-to-back, so we need to be ready, 20 minutes in the game, red card for opponent, we need to win that, no matter what. We have a lot to do and we are going to do it.\"",
      "Amorim continued: \"When I say it is my responsibility, it is my responsibility to explain the game. Today, it is not one mistake of one individual. When we see the results of the weekend, we should get on the pitch with a different excitement.",
      "\"Old Trafford was there, we were going to make a big step up, and we were not ready. These five weeks, everyone was praising our evolution, and I am always saying the same things, we are not near.\"",
      "United wasted a chance to move up the table against Everton. \"I feel afraid of returning this feeling of last season,\" said Amorim. \"That is my biggest concern, we need to work together and we need to be better.\"",
      "United will take on Crystal Palace at Selhurst Park next in the Premier League.",

      "Here, we'll be covering all of the latest transfer news, rumours and gossip surrounding Manchester United.",
      "The Reds suffered defeat to Everton at Old Trafford on Monday evening, closing out a five-game unbeaten streak in the Premier League. Despite the Toffees being a man down after losing Idrissa Gueye 13 minutes into the match, Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall's first-half strike stole all three points for the visitors.",
      "United had the opportunity to take to the top four and formalise a bid for UEFA Champions League qualification, but fate ultimately had other plans. Ruben Amorim will be determined to return to winning ways at the weekend when United take on Crystal Palace at Selhurst Park.",
      "A second-consecutive loss could come as a significant blow in hopes of securing European football for 2026/27, especially with Bryan Mbeumo, Noussair Mazraoui and Amad heading to the play the Africa Cup of Nations soon. As a result of temporary departures, Sir Jim Ratcliffe could see his hand forced in splashing the cash in the January transfer window.",
      "Jean-Philippe Mateta and Conor Gallagher have been linked with moves to Old Trafford, while Vinicius Junior seems unhappy at Real Madrid. On the flipside, Kobbie Mainoo still faces uncertainty at the Theatre of Dreams, while Casemiro has less than a year left on his contract, and could leave for free next summer. Marcus Rashford is also still thriving on a season-long loan with Barcelona, with a decision yet to be made on his future with either club.",
      "With all things considered, the MEN brings you all of the latest United news and transfer rumours...",
      "Manchester United are on the verge of making a key appointment to their recruitment department.",
      "Kyle Macaulay is expected to be named by United as their new head of senior scouting, having been on a four-month search for the role.",
      "Once appointed, Macaulay will report to Christopher Vivell at Old Trafford, who works as the club's director of recruitment.",
      "Joshua Zirkzee has received a less-than-glowing assessment from Michael Owen after his performance against Everton. Zirkzee was handed his first start of the Premier League season by Manchester United on Monday but it did not go to plan for the Dutch striker or his side in a 1-0 defeat.",
      "Zirkzee has been stuck on the substitutes’ bench this season, with Ruben Amorim preferring to start summer signings Matheus Cunha or Benjamin Sesko up front. But with Sesko out injured and Cunha pulling out last-minute due to a knock in training, Amorim had little option but to trust Zirkzee against Everton.",
      "The Toffees were reduced to 10 men after just 13 minutes when Idrissa Gueye was sent off for slapping his team-mate Michael Keane. But United couldn’t take advantage, with Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall’s goal earning the away side all three points as Everton repelled pressure.",
      "United dominated the ball and had 25 shots, but couldn’t find a way past Jordan Pickford, who made an impressive late save to keep out Zirkzee’s header. The 24-year-old is yet to score or assist in six appearances this season and Owen has suggested he doesn’t have a future at the club.",
      "Read the full story here.",
      "A report from Globo Esporte suggests that Manchester United have intensified talks with Wolves over a January transfer for Joao Gomes. It is claimed that the two cloubs are negotiating over the midfielder, and that Untied are optimistic about completing a deal for around £43million.",
      "Alejandro Garnacho made a £40million move from Manchester United to Chelsea this summer, and it appears as though the Argentinian is finding his stride both on and off the pitch under Enzo Maresca.",
      "As per TEAMtalk, Manchester United are interested in Roma's Zeki Celik, but they will face stiff competition for his signature. That's because Liverpool and Arsenal are also said to be monitoring the right-back, who will see his deal expire at the end of the season.",
      "While Roma are thought to be looking at a renewal, sources claim that Celik is in no rush to extend his stay. He is able to sign a pre-contract with another club as of January.",
      "Out-on-loan goalkeeper Andre Onana is reportedly eager to revive his United career once he returns to the club from Trabzonspor. The 29-year-old is spending the campaign in Turkey after losing his No.1 position at Old Trafford following a series of high-profile errors last year.",
      "According to The i Paper, the Cameroon international still hopes to reclaim the gloves upon the conclusion of his loan spell. However, sources close to Onana suggest that a transfer to another Premier League team has not been ruled out, either.",
      "As per Sky Germany, Manchester United are interested in RB Leipzig star, Assan Ouedraogo, and are reportedly scouting him for a potential transfer next summer. The 19-year-old midfielder has thrived with the Bundesliga challengers since his move from Schalke last year, and has also represented Germany on the international stage.",
      "While Ouedraogo doesn;t have a release clause in his contract, which runs until June 2029, he has been valued at between £43million and £52m. A January move for the youngster is unlikely to come to fruition, given he hopes to secure a place in the 2026 World Cup with Germany and wants consistency at club level.",
      "Manchester United have previously been linked with an interest in Atletico Madrid midfielder Conor Gallagher, with an update being given over a potential January move for the player.",
      "Gallagher is keen to move in search of more game time with an eye on forcing his way back into the England squad for the World Cup.",
      "However, Atletico are only keen on a permanent deal, which will cost clubs around £35 million.",
      "As per reports, several clubs including Manchester United are throught to be interested in Crystal Palace talisman, Jean-Philippe Mateta. As per TeamTalk, the 28-year-old is open to leaving Selhurst Park, although the club are said to hope to sign him to a new deal despite discussions coming to a standstill.",
      "Tottenham Hotspur and Newcastle United are also thought to be monitoring the stiker's situation.",
      "Manchester United legends Paul Scholes and Nicky Butt have revealed how they were once consulted over some potential transfer arrivals to the club in a secret meeting. The pair claim it happened during a spell when Ryan Giggs was named as the interim manager, which occurred during the 2013/14 season following the dismissal of David Moyes.",
      "At the time, Manchester United were looking to rebuild following the end of the Sir Alex Ferguson era, with plenty of big-name transfers following in an attempt to get the side back in the Premier League title picture. With that in mind, the executive vice-chairman at the time, Ed Woodward, sought out some help from Scholes and Butt to discuss transfer targets, with a four-man shortlist proposed to the pair.",
      "Speaking on The Good, The Bad & The Football podcast, the United legends were asked about how that meeting with Woodward led to Paul Pogba's return.",
      "Following months of swift development at Barcelona, Marcus Rashford encountered a setback in Spain this week. That's after the Manchester United loanee was forced to observe from the stands whilst his Catalan team-mates created history.",
      "Meanwhile at Old Trafford, Ruben Amorim is working diligently in preparation for what could prove a pivotal January transfer window for the club. The Red Devils are experiencing an upturn in fortunes this season, largely attributed to the squad enhancements secured during the summer.",
      "However, United may need to revise their winter strategy following reports suggesting one prospective signing would favour joining a direct competitor.",
      "Manchester United do not have long to wait before they are able to go into the transfer market for more new signings. Ruben Amorim added five new additions to his squad in the summer and there are already rumours that more players could be signed in the near future.",
      "Benjamin Sesko, Bryan Mbeumo, Matheus Cunha, Senne Lammens, and Diego Leon all moved to Old Trafford during the summer transfer window. With January fast approaching, there are already rumours about the business that United may or may not get completed.",
      "Midfield has been an area of the squad that has seen the majority of the rumours, with Carlos Baleba of Brighton, Elliot Anderson of Nottingham Forest and Adam Wharton of Crystal Palace just some of the names to be linked with a move to United.",
      "On X, previously known as Twitter, the former Everton and Crystal Palace winger posted: \"I'm watching this game on mute [crying with laughter emoji].",
      "\"I respect opinions but not when he's giggling all over the mic thinking he's the second coming of guardiola, allow it... great player but the tactics give it a rest laaaad.\"",
      "\"The minute that you think as a football player that you just have to turn up on that pitch and you're Manchester United and you can play or any football club, you're done.\"",
      "Neville added: \"You can't go from the fight that they showed in certain games to that. It just erodes confidence, it erodes trust. We're trying to build a trust in a manager, we're trying to build a trust in a team.",
      "\"The fans booed collectively at the end. It was loud, and rightly so. That was a really poor performance. It's almost as if you've gone sort of like two or three steps forward, everyone's feeling a little bit better about themselves, and you've just gone back to the start again",
      "\"You can lose football matches, but you can't lose them like that. That's nowhere near good enough, it's not acceptable.\"",
      "\"There was an awful long time left in that game [after 10-man Everton went ahead]. I don't understand how you can stick with something so steadfastly in a situation like that when it's basically one guy up front who's not really up front, you don't need three players there.",
      "\"It's one of those moments where I think a lot of people will really question the manager on the back of that defeat. They'll look at the players, and we know the players should do better, but the manager will take a lot of the blame for tonight.\"",
      "Ruben Amorim has refused to rule out the departures of Johsua Zirkzee and Kobie Mainoo in the January transfer window. The United boss said: \"I was a football player.",
      "\"I understand everything, and I want to help my players in every situation. I understand the frustration of some players, seeing the World Cup is there. I know what it means.",
      "\"But the first thing is that the club comes first. If I can help the club and the players, I will be happy. If not I have to think about the team.\"",
      "It was recently revealed Semenyo has a £65m release clause in his contract at the Vitality Stadium, which he signed in the summer and runs until June 2030.",
      "According to The Mirror, Joao Gomes has been shortlisted by United as a cheaper alternative to Elliot Anderson, who has also attracted interest from the likes of Liverpool and Manchester City.",
      "The report claims the Reds are long admirers of Carlos Baleba, although he and the Nottingham Forest ace would likely cost in excess of £100m. United have reportedly 'extensively watched' the Brazil international over the past 18 months.",
      "Reports from overseas claim Gomes could be available for £44m, but the Mirror reckons that any deal at that price may have to wait until the summer.",
      "When Rob Edwards replaced Vitor Pereira in the dugout, higher-ups at Molineux agreed not to sell the club's prized assets in the upcoming window to give Wolves the best chance of survival.",
      "According to Fabrizio Romano, United want to offer Casemiro a new contract on a reduced salary. The 33-year-old midfielder, who joined the Reds from Real Madrid for £70m in August 2022, has entered the final year of his deal at Old Trafford.",
      "From January, Casemiro will be eligible to open pre-contract talks with foreign clubs over a free transfer in the summer. The Brazil international has featured 11 times for United in the Premier League this season, making 10 starts.",
      "According to The Athletic, Vinicius Junior has informed Real Madrid officials he does not want to renew his contract at the Santiago Bernabeu given his strained relationship with Xabi Alonso.",
      "The 25-year-old winger has less than two years left on his deal, which currently earns him around €17m (£15m) net per season, including bonuses.",
      "The report claims Vinicius Jr spoke to club president Florentino Perez in late October to make his feelings clear...",
      "According to CaughtOffside, Arsenal and United are closely monitoring Scott McTominay’s situation at Napoli. The report claims that Mikel Arteta wants to 'add steel' to his midfield in the January transfer window, so the Gunners have identified the Scot as an option.",
      "It's said that the Italian champions have no intention of letting McTominay go easily, with the club president, Aurelio De Laurentiis, setting an asking price of £60m. CaughtOffside reckons that 'only a substantial offer' will prise the former United ace from Naples.",
      "McTominay is reportedly happy in Italy, settled in Conte's project, and not actively pushing for a move..."

      "Manchester United lost 1-0 against Everton in the Premier League on Monday evening. Everton went down to 10 men just 13 minutes into the game when Idrissa Gueye was shown a red card for slapping his own teammate.",
      "Despite the early sending off, Everton were the better side and deserved to draw first blood through Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall, who beat Senne Lammens from the edge of the box. United pushed for an equaliser but couldn't find a breakthrough as Jordan Pickford denied Joshua Zirkzee with an excellent late save.",
      "Here are how United's players rated at Old Trafford:",
      "Senne Lammens",
      "Should have done better for Dewsbury-Hall's strike. His starting position made it difficult for him to get across to his left-hand side. 5",
      "Leny Yoro",
      "Didn't commit to the challenge when Dewsbury-Hall picked up the ball on the edge of the box, which proved costly. 5",
      "Matthijs de Ligt",
      "Was caught out of position a few times when Everton looked dangerous in the first half. Didn't have much to do after the break when United finally started to ask a few questions. 5",
      "Luke Shaw",
      "Made an excellent challenge at the beginning of the second half and tried to rally his teammates as Everton held onto their one-goal advantage. 5",
      "Noussair Mazraoui",
      "Didn't offer much going forward in the first 45 minutes and was hooked at the interval in a tactical tweak from Amorim. 4",
      "Casemiro",
      "Although Casemiro has become an influential figure again this season he looked like a 33-year-old and was passive. It wasn't a surprise to see him substituted in the 58th minute. 4",
      "Bruno Fernandes",
      "His passing was sloppy at times and he resorted to shooting from distance in an effort to get United back into the contest. Wasted a big chance from close range with 20 minutes remaining. 4",
      "Patrick Dorgu",
      "Looks low on confidence and was poor again at Old Trafford. He missed a decent chance in the first half - his end product must improve - and is likely to be replaced by Dalot at the weekend. 3",
      "Bryan Mbeumo",
      "The international break had the potential to disrupt Mbeumo's momentum. The 26-year-old showed determination on a night when United weren't at the races for large parts. 5",
      "Amad",
      "Was probably the pick of a bad bunch in the first half. Amad relocated to right wing-back when Mazraoui was brought off and he was still involved in most attacking phases of play. 5",
      "Joshua Zirkzee",
      "The highlight of Zirkzee's first half was his heated exchange with James Tarkowski. The Dutchman made his first start of the campaign and didn't do much until drawing a late save from Pickford. 4",
      "Mason Mount",
      "Made a difference when he came on. 6",
      "Diogo Dalot",
      "An improvement on Dorgu. 5",
      "Kobbie Mainoo",
      "Tried his best. 5",

      "Ruben Amorim disagreed with the decision to send off Everton midfielder Idrissa Gana Gueye against Manchester United and said that he wants his players to \"fight each other\".",
      "Gueye was sent off for slapping teammate Michael Keane in the 13th minute of the game. The Premier League said on the decision: \"The referee’s call of red card to Gueye for violent conduct was checked and confirmed by VAR – with the action deemed to be a clear strike to the face of Keane.\"",
      "Despite playing most of the contest with 10 men, Everton were able to secure three points thanks to Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall's strike in the first half. Amorim was asked whether he was embarrassed about the result, and responded: \"It was also 11 v 11, the first moments you can feel it.\"",
      "He explained that he disagreed with the sending off, saying: \"Fighting is not a bad thing, it doesn’t mean they don’t like each other. I don’t agree with that sending off, we can fight with teammates.",
      "\"I hope my players, when they lose the ball, they fight each other. They cannot be a sending off, but my players show many games that we can do it. Today we didn’t manage to do it.\"",
      "Amorim added on the display: \"When you have more players with different characteristics, you have more options to score goals, especially against low blocks.",
      "\"We could lose the game, but with a different intensity. The other team fight each other and we didn’t understand the moments of the game and that is my fault, I need to explain every moment.\"",
      "\"If nothing happened, I don't think anyone in the stadium would have been surprised,\" said Moyes. \"I thought the referee could have taken a bit longer to think about it.",
      "\"I got told that the rules of the game that if you slap your own player, you could be in trouble. But there's another side to it: I like my players fighting each other, if someone didn't do the right action. If you want that toughness and resilience to get a result, you want someone to act on it.",
      "\"I'm disappointed we got the sending off. But we've all been footballers, we get angry with our teammates. He's apologised for the sending off, he's praised the players and thanked them for it and apologised for what happened.\"",

      "Ruben Amorim waved his arms and screamed as Manchester United attempted to win the ball back from Everton. Amorim insisted after each win in October there was plenty more work to do and he was right.",
      "Everton had won just once at United in the Premier League in the past 32 years, a 1-0 triumph in 2013 under Roberto Martinez when David Moyes was managing in the home dugout.",
      "Moyes had not won at Old Trafford in 17 attempts as a visiting manager, so history was stacked against Everton, but he oversaw an unlikely victory with just 10 men on the pitch.",
      "Amorim made two changes and both were enforced, with Harry Maguire and Matheus Cunha dropping out of the squad due to injury, opening the door for Leny Yoro and Joshua Zirkzee to start.",
      "The tactical battle was an interesting one in the opening exchanges. Everton played a high line and pressed with purpose. They wanted Senne Lammens to kick the ball long because they have the height to win aerial balls.",
      "James Tarkowski pushed Zirkzee to the floor in an off-the-ball incident. Zirkzee came close to squaring up with the defender, but referee Tony Harrington gave both a warning.",
      "There must have been something in the air because tensions then boiled over between Everton players. Idrissa Gana Gueye was unhappy with Michael Keane, and he slapped his own teammate in a moment of madness. Gueye was shown a red card and was red in the face as Jordan Pickford held him back.",
      "Bruno Fernandes stood yards away from the incident and couldn't believe what he was watching. The Everton analysts who were sitting in the press box looked equally dumbfounded.",
      "United had kept just one clean sheet in the league, which came against Sunderland, before the visit of Everton, but the sending off handed a huge opportunity to record another.",
      "That's without mentioning that Everton's strikers can't score for toffee. Thierno Barry was goalless in 11 league appearances but was given the nod to start, which meant Beto (one goal in 11) was on the bench. However, Iliman Ndiaye looked threatening at times and Jack Grealish was involved on the left.",
      "United started so badly that Gueye's sending off didn't stop Everton from being on the front foot. The travelling Evertonians chirped and erupted when Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall opened the scoring.",
      "\"Hit it,\" shouted the Everton analyst. Leny Yoro didn't commit to the challenge and Lammens should have done better. The goalkeeper's starting position was poor and the shot was saveable.",
      "Kobbie Mainoo and Lisandro Martinez returned to the squad after recovering from their respective injuries, although the latter's return was more significant given the length of his lay-off.",
      "Martinez had been sidelined for nine months with a cruciate ligament injury. It was great to see him back in the squad and he received a warm reception when he emerged to warm up.",
      "There was further applause for youngster Shea Lacey, who was named in a senior squad for the first time, reward for delivering consistently strong performances in academy fixtures. Lacey has a high ceiling and his squad inclusion is expected to be the first of many.",
      "Mani from The Stone Roses sadly passed away this month. United played \"I Want To Be Adored\" as kick-off approached, and \"This Is The One\" carried more meaning as the players walked out.",
      "The first half performance was reminiscent of last season. United must brush teams like Everton aside at home if they want to secure Champions League qualification next season. November started with draws against Nottingham Forest and Tottenham, but Everton was a much bigger setback.",
      "Most of those in red shirts looked disinterested in the first half, and Amorim hooked Noussair Mazraoui at the interval. Mason Mount was introduced and Amad relocated to right wing-back.",
      "Patrick Dorgu had another game to forget and was hauled off before the hour mark. The problem is his replacement, Diogo Dalot, has also been unconvincing from the left this season. The huge cheer for Mainoo as he replaced Casemiro showed what fans think about the handling of him.",
      "Amorim was widely praised after an excellent October, but United have not entered the winter as they would have liked. The games come thick and fast, and they must find another response.",
      "There were joyous scenes in the Everton section at the full-time whistle. Yoro slumped to his knees and Fernandes complained. The United captain should look at himself first after such a poor display.",
      "Moyes claimed an away win at Old Trafford on his 18th attempt. He'll argue it was worth the wait.",

      "Alejandro Garnacho was spotted encouraging Jamie Gittens as the two walked down the tunnel at Turf Moor on Saturday.",
      "Gittens was drafted into Enzo Maresca's starting XI ahead of the Argentinian forward for Chelsea's clash with Burnley, but rather than spit the dummy out, the 21-year-old showed maturity with a gesture as the two walked down the tunnel for the second-half.",
      "Garnacho was walking ahead of the Englishman, when Gittens appeared to call him before making a cheeky gesture with his fingers towards his eyes to joke he was watching him. Garnacho replied with a smile and a gesture of his own as they walked out of shot of TV cameras.",
      "Despite failing to make an appearance in the game from the bench, Garnacho was also quick to approach the away end of Turf Moor after Chelsea's 2-0 win to thank fans for making the long trip to the north west from the English capital.",
      "And when Gittens took to Instagram in the aftermath of the game to mark his appearance against Burnley with a carousel of photographs, Garnacho was once again fast to show his support with a glowing comment. On the post, Garnacho wrote: \"Jammmieeee,\" with a starry-eyed emoji, to which, Gittens responded: \"My brother,\" with a fingers crossed emoji and a love heart.",
      "As a result, it seems as though Garnacho is not only finding his stride on the pitch, but it also forging strong relationships with his new team-mates off it. Since making a £40million move from Manchester United this summer, Garnacho has racked up two goals and two assists from 10 appearances across all competitions.",
      "Meanwhile, Maresca was also quick to praise the talent earlier this month. He said of Garnacho: \"He arrived here from another club where he was not training 100 per cent so his physical condition was not good.",
      "\"Slowly, slowly, now it’s better. He’s doing very well on the ball but he’s doing very, very well off the ball. He knows that to play with us he has to be good on the ball and off the ball otherwise he’s not going to play. We are very happy with him at this moment.\"",
      "It's a polar opposite state of affairs to how Garnacho was faring with United earlier this season. After falling out of favour under Ruben Amorim, Garnacho lambasted the club's lacklustre 15th-place finish in the Premier League.",
      "He was also upset at losing the Europa League final to a similarly-struggling Tottenham at the time. He said in May: \"It’s difficult for all of us. This season has been s***. We lost the final, we didn’t beat anyone in PL. It’s very difficult.\"",
      "It comes as United could have seemingly used some of Garnacho's creativity on Monday night, with the Reds struggling to create chances against a 10-man Everton at Old Trafford. Despite having a numerical advantage as a result of Idrissa Gueye's red card for slapping team-mate, Michael Keane, just 13 minutes into the match, United struggled to crack the code of David Moyes' rejuvenated outfit.",
      "Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall stole the game for the visitors 29 minutes into the match, with his goal ultimately deciding the fixture as a result of a Jordan Pickford masterclass. United will also be feeling the sting of mid-season injuries, given they had to rely on Joshua Zirkzee for the duration as a result of Matheus Cunha and Benjamin Sesko sitting sidelined.",
      "Zirkzee has struggled to adapt to the physicality of the Premier League since making the move from Bologna last summer, scoring just three goals in the English top flight last season. It will be interesting to see how Amorim adapts in the coming weeks, given Sesko is expected to be out of action until December.",
      "It is also unknown as to when Cunha will return to action, after suffering a knock in training last week. United next face Crystal Palace at Selhurst Park come Sunday, November 30.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Big Sam has managed over a thousand games in his career and will come back for one more in a special Mirror Sport competition.",
      "The former Bolton, Newcastle, West Ham, Sunderland and Everton boss will oversee selection, tactics and deliver the pre-match, half-time and full-time talks for one lucky amateur team.",
      "Allardyce is one of the football personalities backing a Sky Bet and British Heart Foundation (BHF) initiative to raise awareness of life-saving CPR amongst everyone in grassroots football",
      "It is part of the pioneering Every Minute Matters campaign – a unique partnership between Sky Bet and BHF and supported by the English Football League - which has already successfully inspired over 350,000 people to start learning CPR since the campaign launched in May 2024.",
      "To have a chance of signing Big Sam for the day, simply send your name, contact details, the name of your team and your league, in the form below. If you can't see the form,  click here.",
      "The winner will be drawn on December 1 and Sam will take charge of a game between January 1 and April 30, 2026.",
      "All entrants need to be part of an adult over 18s men’s or women’s 11-a-side team. Teams from walking football can enter.",
      "Allardyce was inspired to help the Every Minute Matters campaign by the shocking experience suffered by Fabrice Muamba, whose heart stopped beating for a total of 78 minutes after he suffered a cardiac arrest in an FA Cup match at White Hart Lane in 2012.",
      "Allardyce explains: “I can still vividly remember what happened to Fabrice a couple of years after I left Bolton. Thanks to immediate CPR and defibrillation, Fabrice made a full recovery. But most grassroots football teams don’t have a medical team on site, which is why it’s critical anyone who plays amateur football – at any level – knows how to perform CPR and use a defibrillator.",
      "“Too many people still think you have to be a medical professional to step in, but that’s simply not true. Anyone can learn these lifesaving skills and if someone collapses, you need to have the confidence to act. “And that confidence comes from training. That’s why I’m urging everyone in grassroots football to take 15 minutes to learn CPR and defibrillation with the BHF’s brilliant free online tool, RevivR.”",
      "This competition closes at 12pm on the 1st of December 2025."

      "Manchester United legends Paul Scholes and Nicky Butt have revealed how they were once consulted over some potential transfer arrivals to the club in a secret meeting.",
      "The pair claim it happened during a spell when Ryan Giggs was named as the interim manager, which occurred during the 2013/14 season following the dismissal of David Moyes.",
      "At the time, Manchester United were looking to rebuild following the end of the Sir Alex Ferguson era, with plenty of big-name transfers following in an attempt to get the side back in the Premier League title picture.",
      "With that in mind, the executive vice-chairman at the time, Ed Woodward, sought out some help from Scholes and Butt to discuss transfer targets, with a four-man shortlist proposed to the pair.",
      "Speaking on The Good, The Bad & The Football podcast, the United legends were asked about how that meeting with Woodward led to Paul Pogba's return.",
      "Butt responded and said: \"I just remember Ryan [Giggs] took control of the club for four or five or six games at the end of the season... then me and Scholesy did it [the meeting] with him and Phil as well.",
      "\"And I remember obviously they were looking for the right manager to come in and take the job, so they obviously needed targets to go and get in the summer.",
      "\"So I had left the training ground and got called back, and there was a meeting with myself, Scholesy, Ryan, and Ed Woodward, and I think Ed Woodward was on a Zoom call; it wasn't so much face-to-face, I think he was in London, and it was like 'Who would you get?'",
      "\"And he gave us a list of midfielders, I know Pogba was one, Kroos weren't you saying? Fabregas might've been one.\"",
      "Scholes added: \"I think Fabregas might've been one as well, I think even Modric might've been one as well.\"",
      "Butt continued: \"I remember we were all discussing pros and cons to them all, and the end of the conversation was 'go for both of them, Kroos and Pogba, because we're Man United and we need to get back to the top'.",
      "\"And if you get one, it's like yin and yang, we mentioned it a while ago, about if you get centre-backs, with Harry Maguire, and you need a footballing player next to him, it's a bit of the same with midfielders.",
      "\"We're not all the same, and you need a bit to complement each other, and that was how it was left, and then they went all-out for Pogba.\"",
      "United went on to re-sign Pogba in August 2016, in a deal from Juventus that could have reached up to £93m with all of the add-ons included.",
      "The French midfielder went on to make 233 appearances for the club, scoring 39 goals and assisting 51 times for his teammates, before leaving in 2022 on a free transfer.",
      "Pogba's career is often reflected on in different ways, with many remembering the magic he could conjure up, while others believe he never found it consistently enough to match the large fee paid for him.",
      "Perhaps the addition of Toni Kroos, Luka Modric, or Cesc Fabregas alongside him could've changed those fortunes, with the former pair impressing at Real Madrid for many more years to come, while the latter had a spell back in England with Chelsea, before featuring in France and then Italy.",

      "Matthijs de Ligt believes Manchester United lacked urgency against Everton on Monday, which he felt made it difficult for them to break down a team that \"drops back\" and is \"really strong in the air\".",
      "United returned from the November international break undefeated in their last five games in the Premier League, but they suffered a shocking 1-0 defeat against 10-man Everton.",
      "Although Idrissa Gana Gueye was sent off for slapping his own teammate, Michael Keane, in the 13th minute, Everton opened the scoring through Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall. United struggled to create many clear-cut chances as they looked to respond in the second half, and Everton comfortably dealt with crosses into the box.",
      "Ruben Amorim admitted that United deserved to lose during his post-match press conference, and he added: \"I feel afraid of returning this feeling of last season.\"",
      "Speaking to MUTV, De Ligt was visibly disappointed as he reflected on the team's performance. “It’s quite clear, not good,\" he said. \"Today was a bad night for us, especially with the way we played against 10 men. We conceded one goal, didn't create a lot of chances, so overall it was a really bad performance.",
      "\"It's frustrating, but that's football. The Premier League is not for the weak. One chance could be a goal and if they score after one chance and we don't, that makes a difference today.",
      "\"That's football, that's the difference between winning and losing, the efficiency. And today we lacked that, we lacked the urgency to score the goals, create the chances, and against a team like Everton, who drop back and are really strong in the air, it's going to be quite difficult.",
      "\"That basically sums up the night. I'm disappointed with today. The next game is really important now and we have to bounce back. We had some good performances in the last couple of weeks and now we had a bad one. We must come back, stay together and to make clear what has to be better.\"",
      "Amorim said: \"Frustration, disappointment about the way we played the game. They were the better team, with 11 they defend really well for 70 minutes with 10 men. I think we deserved to lose.",
      "\"We didn’t play well, we didn’t play with the right intensity. We talk about this a lot [about what went wrong], I know which point we are at the moment, I have that feeling during this run.",
      "\"We are not there, not even near the point we should be to fight for the best positions in the league. We need to be perfect to win games and we were not.\"",
      "Asked whether some of his players did not show the intensity he wants, Amorim responded: \"We need to find a way, I don’t like to say we can, we show and then it is one game by week.",
      "\"It is not back-to-back, so we need to be ready, 20 minutes in the game, red card for opponent, we need to win that, no matter what. We have a lot to do and we are going to do it.\"",

      "Nobody would have believed this statement at the start of the season, but Luke Shaw can be classed as one of the best players of the season so for Manchester United. Ignoring the Manchester City defeat, where nobody covered themselves in glory, Shaw has been a dependable option for Ruben Amorim.",
      "His reliability has been missing in recent years. In the 2024/25 season, he missed 294 days due to three injuries. The season prior it was 239 days and there were question marks over whether he would stay fit long enough to contribute to the cause.",
      "And yet, his redemption arc has been spectacular in the 2025/26 campaign. He has started every single Premier League fixture for Amorim and is settled on the left of the back three in Lisandro Martinez's absence.",
      "None of this could have been expected at the end of last season but it is a credit to the medical team and Shaw that he has managed to become a regular again. However, this could all unravel if Amorim goes with the idea he floated in his pre-Everton press conference when asked whether Shaw could play at left wing-back.",
      "\"He can play left wing-back but of course the load that a player does in that position is a little different if you are doing that on a daily basis,\" Amorim said.",
      "\"He is more prepared to do that position but of course he can play there, he is a smart player and he is fit in the moment so I think he is an option.\" In a way, you can see why Amorim would come to that conclusion.",
      "Naturally, Shaw is a full-back but he has suffered a lot of injuries since last playing on the flank. He has had to adapt his style of play and is impressing in the less physically demanding role of left centre-back.",
      "Amorim said it himself in his press conference, the load a player at wing-back has to take on is much more than what he is doing now and would stretch Shaw's body to the maximum, increasing the chances of an injury.",
      "Even if United were confident Shaw has overcome past issues, now is not the time to trial him at wing back. United are about to enter their busiest period of the campaign and it would be asking for trouble to shift Shaw out wide.",

      "“Very impressed, very impressed, and sometimes even a little bit surprised,\" said Bristol City manager Gerhard Struber about Manchester United loanee Radek Vitek last month. \"He’s young, and he looks like an outstanding, experienced Championship goalkeeper.”",
      "The general rule with United loans is that they send players with a genuine chance of contributing to the first team at Old Trafford on loan to the Championship. Vitek and Toby Collyer are currently playing in the division. Alvaro Fernandez and Amad were success stories at Preston and Sunderland respectively.",
      "The Championship is an unforgiving 46-game campaign, and young players must demonstrate resilience and quality to be successful in the division.",
      "Vitek has shown a lot of quality since he signed for Bristol City on a season-long loan. The goalkeeper has started every league game, kept five clean sheets and has won huge praise from their fans.",
      "He made the perfect first impression after signing on loan, saving a penalty in Bristol City's final pre-season game, and has not looked back.",
      "\"Of course, signing a player from Manchester United always brings with it a sense of excitement, but the 22-year-old was certainly an unknown quantity when he arrived.",
      "\"A penalty save and clean sheet in his first, and only, friendly for the Robins against Real Valladolid impressed those in attendance, and Vitek has only improved from that point on.",
      "\"His opening day display away to Sheffield United was superb as he commanded his penalty area brilliantly and pulled off a handful of smart stops from a variety of different scenarios.",
      "\"While you would expect a young goalkeeper to potentially be a bit of a rabbit in the headlights in what is an incredibly physical Championship this season, Vitek has looked like a veteran stopper in England’s second tier.\"",
      "He continued: \"Barring one uncharacteristic error in the 5-1 defeat to Stoke City, Vitek has been brilliant. It isn’t an exaggeration to suggest he has single-handedly won points on several occasions.",
      "\"He has produced multiple match-deciding stops at crucial points of matches. Vitek has kept five clean sheets over the course of his first 15 matches in red and white, and you could argue he deserves more.",
      "\"Against the likes of Charlton, Norwich City, Birmingham City and Hull City, it was his work between the posts as much as that of the attackers at the other end of the pitch that proved to be the difference, with his showing against the Addicks in particular a real standout.",
      "\"The fans have taken to him, as displayed by his interactions with away ends. The fact that he has kept Max O’Leary out of the team - the goalkeeper who played all 46 matches last season as the Reds ended their 17-year wait for a top six finish - speaks volumes to just how impressed Struber has been so far.\"",
      "Vitek cut his teeth on loan with Accrington Stanley in the second half of 2023/24. He joined the League Two club in the winter window and made 18 starts in the league, helping to guide them to safety.",
      "When Vitek reported for pre-season at Carrington after that loan, he started in a United friendly against Rosenborg in Norway and delivered a man-of-the-match performance.",
      "He told MUTV: \"It's really good for youngsters to get the opportunity, but when you step on the field you have to show yourself because it's a big chance in front of a lot of people.\"",
      "When asked about what it was like to represent United in pre-season, Vitek smiled and added: \"It's an amazing feeling, the fans are absolutely amazing and it was a full stadium of red shirts.\"",
      "Vitek was named in the 29-man travelling squad for the United States tour, but he was sent on a season-long loan to Austrian club FC Blau-Weiß Linz after returning to Manchester.",
      "During his unveiling, FC Blau-Weiß Linz's sporting director said: \"With Radek, we are getting a very talented young goalkeeper who has already gained a lot of experience in England and is, among other things, part of the goalkeeping team of Manchester United's first team.\"",
      "Vitek started almost every league game for FC Blau-Weiß Linz, only missing three matches due to an injury. His loan was a resounding success and FC Blau-Weiß Linz wanted to re-sign him on loan this summer.",
      "Speaking in June, United academy goalkeeper coach Tommy Lee said: “Radek has done great in Austria. He got an injury early on but recovered extremely well and played really well.",
      "\"He has got really good experience there. I think we often use Radek as an example to some of the younger goalkeepers. He is a player who maximises every part of the programme to ensure he is the best he can possibly be. Nutrition, gym, analysis. He is the consummate professional.",
      "\"That is going to take him, I believe, to the top level. He is a talented boy and that needs to be said. He’s 6ft 6ins, which always helps. For the other lads, their challenge is to be as good as Radek and do everything he does and more. He is a great example of someone who does that.\"",
      "Bristol City was chosen as the best destination for Vitek to take the next step in his career, and he signed a new contract with United, expiring in 2028, before moving south to Ashton Gate for this season.",
      "Carter explained: \"United fans will have likely seen the clip of the ridiculous save Radek Vitek made to deny Oli McBurnie from close range in City’s win over Hull City back in October.",
      "\"He got down well to claw a low header off the line and away from danger, a stop you wouldn’t imagine someone his size could make, and it was just one of multiple key saves in that contest.",
      "\"His intervention to deny Norwich City’s Jack Stacey at Carrow Road may have been even better, however. Stacey had peeled into space in the centre of the penalty area and wrapped his foot around a cut-back to fire a shot towards the bottom right corner.",
      "\"Despite having an obscured view, Vitek took off to his left and got down well to not only get a big hand on the bouncing shot but also push it into the path of Neto Borges, who could hack clear.",
      "\"Struber said after that win at Carrow Road that even he was surprised at times by just what Vitek was capable of. I am probably forgetting other impressive saves, but the fact that there are quite so many to pick from is a testament to just how good Vitek has been during his loan.\"",
      "Discussing Vitek's strengths and weaknesses, Carter said: \"He is a really good shot-stopper. Whether it be when reacting to close-range efforts or when dealing with looping shots from range, he seems to have the answer more often than not.",
      "\"If you were to look back at the goals he has conceded so far this season, you’d do well to suggest he could have done much better with all but a handful of them.",
      "\"When it comes to commanding his box, he uses every inch of his frame to deal well with high balls, whether that be from open play or set-pieces. It has been clear this season just how much more comfortable Bristol City have been when defending corners, and a large part of that has been their goalkeeper’s willingness to leave his line and deal with looping balls.",
      "\"It is challenging to identify a major weakness, but I think you could make a compelling argument that distribution is Vitek’s primary area for improvement.",
      "\"He can kick the ball further than most goalkeepers I’ve seen at Ashton Gate, and he has pulled off a couple of smart - if concerning - Cruyff turns, but he has probably kicked goal kicks into touch a bit too often. He is by no means terrible with the ball at his feet, but he could be a bit more polished.\"",
      "When asked whether Vitek could play in the Premier League, he added: \"Absolutely. Bristol City have signed several players on loan from Premier League clubs over the years, and although it is still early days, Radek Vitek has been one of the most impressive.",
      "\"Vitek has been one of the division’s best shot stoppers and he is excellent when it comes to commanding his box. Naturally, given his age and lack of top-flight experience, he has room to improve, but you would struggle to find a Bristol City fan who wasn’t confident that Vitek will play in the Premier League.",
      "\"Of course, it will depend on what Manchester United plan to do with him come the end of his time at Ashton Gate, but I would imagine his performances will have caught the eye of some Premier League sides.",
      "\"Whether it be at Old Trafford, another club, or hopefully, in another loan spell with the Robins after helping them win promotion this term, I’d expect Vitek to be playing top-flight football next season.\"",
      "\"It was the best thing to do and get more experience at a higher level than last year. It was a no-brainer because to play in the Championship for a club such as Bristol City for me was really attractive. I said yes straight away after I spoke with Gerhard Struber.\"",
      "Vitek continued: \"I'm still quite young, but I would describe myself as a goalkeeper who likes to be both dominant and also confident for the team in front of me so they can rely on me.",
      "\"Everything since day one has come together. The people around the club, the city… everyone has been really nice to me since day one and the fans have been amazing. The first game away from home... to celebrate the win like that was an amazing memory. I don't think I'll ever forget it.\"",
      "He went on to discuss his hopes of playing for United. \"I'm taking it step-by-step and we'll see next summer what's best for me,\" he said. \"I speak on a regular basis with my goalkeeper coach from Manchester United who has come here to watch my games and I have a good connection with them.",
      "\"I know they're watching me and I really appreciate that I'm not just the guy who is being forgotten or anything. Obviously long term, I would love to play for Manchester United one day, but also I'm realistic and I know that my pathway can lead somewhere different as well.\"",
      "Vitek has huge potential and could challenge Senne Lammens for the No.1 spot next season.",

      "Former Manchester United star Marcus Rashford has issued the perfect response to ex-teammate Paul Pogba's emotional statement. That's following the midfielder's long-awaited comeback to football.",
      "Pogba, 32, has had two spells with United throughout his career, initially as a youth prospect before he re-joined the club in 2016 from Juventus for a then world-record fee. Rashford, meanwhile, is a product of United's academy - although he's currently out on loan with La Liga giants Barcelona.",
      "Pogba departed Old Trafford for the final time in 2022 following the expiration of his contract and returned to Juventus as a free agent. However, in his second season back in Turin, he was hit with a shock doping ban.",
      "The Frenchman was handed a provisional four-year suspension from football back in February 2024 after testing positive for dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), a result stemming from a sample taken the previous August. Pogba has always insisted it was a mistake and he had been given a supplement without knowing it contained a banned substance.",
      "His suspension was eventually reduced - and he was cleared to return to football in March this year. He became a free agent when his contract with Juventus was mutually terminated at the end of 2024, and he joined Ligue 1 side AS Monaco in June.",
      "Pogba has been forced to wait to return to the pitch, however, due to the need to rebuild fitness. He finally made his debut this weekend as he came on as a late substitute in Monaco's 4-1 defeat away at Rennes.",
      "Speaking on Instagram on Sunday, Pogba said: \"Last night was unforgettable. Stepping back on to the pitch after two years away meant more to me than I can express.",
      "\"To the fans, thank you for the love, the energy, and the belief. To everyone who stood behind me, supported me, and pushed me through every moment of this journey, I'm deeply grateful.",
      "\"This debut wasn't just mine... it belonged to all of you who never stopped supporting me.\"",
      "A handful of his former United teammates have showed their support in the comments of the post. Rashford was among them, leaving a simple red heart emoji.",
      "Current United captain Bruno Fernandes also echoed the sentiment - from his previous Instagram story - with the comment \"Pogback,\" while Jesse Lingard replied: \"The boy'ss back.\"",
      "Pogba came on as a late substitute in the 85th-minute, although the match was all but lost for Monaco at that stage as they trailed 4-0, with a late consolation making it 4-1 in added time. This week, however, the midfielder will hope to rack up more minutes with a crucial Champions League match against Pafos.",
      "That's followed by a trip to face French giants Paris Saint-Germain next weekend.",

      "Manchester United return to Premier League action on Monday evening following the final international break of the year.",
      "The Reds have enjoyed a far more promising start to the season compared to last year, with five wins from their 11 league matches so far. They currently sit tenth in the standings, but a win over Everton on Monday would take them into the top five, and potentially into fourth depending on the scoreline.",
      "However, Ruben Amorim has still had to navigate a handful of injury concerns, including one to summer striker signing Benjamin Sesko. That said, United currently have a relatively modest injury list compared to some of their league rivals.",
      "Here, MEN Sport takes a look at United's current fitness concerns and when those players can expect to return to action...",
      "United's summer striker signing Sesko has been sidelined since before the international break, when he was forced off with a knee injury against Tottenham. As a result, he didn’t join up with the Slovenian national team for their World Cup qualifiers against Sweden and Kosovo.",
      "It does not appear a return is imminent either, as Amorim confirmed in his pre-Everton press conference that the 22-year-old is not quite ready to come back. \"He is going to stay a few weeks out,\" the United boss said.",
      "\"I don't know how long but it is not that serious. We have to be careful with him. He is going to recover. He is doing the recovery and he is feeling better so we expect in a few weeks to have him back.\"",
      "Potential return date: Wolves (A) - December 8.",
      "Another of United's summer signings, Matheus Cunha, is also a surprise doubt for the Everton clash after he was forced to pull out of a Christmas lights switch-on in Altrincham over the weekend. The Brazilian was due to attend the event on Saturday night, but “medical reasons” were cited as the reason for his absence.",
      "\"Unfortunately, Matheus Cunha has had an accident in training today and will not be able to attend tonight's Christmas Lights Switch on in Altrincham due to medical reasons,\" VisitAltrincham wrote in a statement.",
      "It remains unclear how serious the issue is or whether he will feature against the Toffees.",
      "Potential return date: Unknown.",
      "Midfielder Kobbie Mainoo faces a late fitness test ahead of the meeting at Old Trafford. Amorim revealed in his press conference late last week that he hadn’t trained, but could still return in time for Everton.",
      "\"Kobbie didn't train today, but I think tomorrow we could see Kobbie, so we will see,\" the manager explained.",
      "Potential return date: Everton (H) – November 24.",
      "Defender Harry Maguire also picked up a muscular injury in the draw with Tottenham prior to the international break. He was forced off shortly after the 70th minute and replaced by Leny Yoro.",
      "Amorim confirmed last week that the England international will not be ready for the visit of Everton and it is currently unclear when he will return.",
      "Potential return date: Unknown.",
      "United's long-term absentee is defender Lisandro Martinez, who sustained an ACL injury back in February. After nine months on the sidelines, he is understood to be closing in on a return, having been building up his fitness after a prolonged period out.",
      "\"I feel that Licha is becoming close to being ready to play,\" the United boss revealed last week. \"Of course, we need to be careful, he's going to struggle in the first minutes, but he's clearly in a better position when you compare two weeks ago.\"",
      "Potential return date: November 2025",

      "Members of the Manchester United squad have made their feelings on Paul Pogba clear after the midfielder made his long-awaited return to the pitch on Saturday evening.",
      "The 32-year-old spent several years at United across two spells, having initially joined the club aged 16. He departed for Juventus as a free agent in 2012, but returned for a then world-record fee in 2016.",
      "He amassed over 230 appearances across all competitions during that time - scoring 39 goals and registering 51 assists. Pogba then rejoined Juventus in 2022 at the end of his contract, but made his last competitive outing for the Serie A club in September 2023.",
      "The Frenchman was handed a provisional four-year ban from football in February 2024 after testing positive for dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), a result that came from a sample taken the previous August. Pogba has always insisted it was a mistake and he had been given a supplement without knowing it contained a banned substance.",
      "His ban was eventually reduced and he was permitted to return to football in March this year. He was without a club after his contract with Juventus was terminated by mutual agreement towards the end of 2024.",
      "Pogba returned to France to join Ligue 1 side Monaco on a free transfer in June, but had to wait to make his debut as he needed to rebuild his fitness after such a long absence. On Saturday, he came off the bench in their 4-1 defeat to Rennes, marking his first appearance in more than two years.",
      "Members of the current United squad, including captain Bruno Fernandes, took to social media to congratulate Pogba on his return. The Portuguese playmaker shared a post on his Instagram story of Pogba - followed by the caption: \"Pogbaaaaaack.\"",
      "Bryan Mbeumo, who joined United from Brentford during the summer transfer window just gone, also posted on Instagram. He re-shared a clip from Monaco's official account showing Pogba coming on as a substitute, followed by a holding-back-tears emoji and heart emojis.",
      "It was not the exact return Pogba would have wanted as his side succumbed to a 4-1 loss, although they were already four behind and a man down when he took to the pitch - in the 85th minute. The result leaves Monaco eighth in the Ligue 1 standings, level on points with Lille, who have a game-in-hand.",
      "With minutes now under his belt, Pogba will no doubt hope to play a role in some huge games coming up for the French side over the next week. They first meet Pafos away in the Champions League on Wednesday night, which will be followed by the visit of Paris Saint-Germain next weekend.",
      "United, meanwhile, return to action on Monday night with a test against Everton in the Premier League. Next weekend, they will take on Crystal Palace away from home.",

      "Manchester United head coach Ruben Amorim has been left sweating this weekend over the fitness of Matheus Cunha ahead of the Premier League return vs Everton on Monday night. On Friday, the Portuguese head coach confirmed Benjamin Sesko would miss the next few weeks due to a knee injury suffered in the draw at Tottenham.",
      "However, a statement from an unlikely source has subsequently cast doubt over the fitness of Cunha. On Saturday evening, the Brazilian was due to switch the Christmas lights on in Altrincham but the organisers announced the forward had been forced to pull out.",
      "In a statement, VisitAltrincham confirmed: \"Unfortunately, Matheus Cunha has had an accident in training today and will not be able to attend tonight’s Christmas Lights Switch on in Altrincham due to medical reasons.\"",
      "So far, there has been no indication from United as to how bad the issue is. If Cunha is to miss the Reds' clash with Everton on Monday night, this leaves Amorim with plenty to think about in regards his team selection. Missing two players who the United boss has tended to favour in attack could lead to an interesting forward line.",
      "From new roles to a fringe player returning to the fore, MEN Sport has taken a look at three ways United could line-up if Cunha is missing on Monday night against Everton and beyond.",
      "United were always likely to deploy the false nine system on Monday night due to Sesko's absence. Ordinarily in the strikerless formation, Cunha would sit at the top of the attack but if he is not fit, that role could be given to Bryan Mbeumo.",
      "Playing as a centre-forward is a position which Mbeumo knows fairly well from his time at Brentford. In his last four appearances leading the attack for the Bees in the Premier League, he scored four goals so he clearly knows how to play the role.",
      "If the Reds were to start Mbeumo in the advanced role, Mason Mount and Amad are the ones most likely to feature behind him. Mount did well in his cameo role at Spurs and while the Ivorian has become more dangerous in the wider role, he can still impact the game positively from the No.10 position.",
      "There is a consensus that Joshua Zirkzee's time at Old Trafford is coming to an end. The Dutchman has played just 90 minutes over five sub appearances for the Reds and we can expect Zirkzee to request an exit in January as he launches a last gasp bid for a World Cup spot.",
      "Earlier this week, when it became clear Sesko would be out, there was a feeling Zirkzee was about to discover his position at the club. Amorim favours a centre forward unless facing a team who are more likely to attack than sit back; so to choose the strikerless system would be to confirm the Dutchman is not in his plans.",
      "Now Cunha could be out too and should Zirkzee be overlooked it would only further confirm his slipping position at Old Trafford. Were he to return, we could expect him to lead the line with Mbeumo and Amad in behind. On paper, this would be a good option but evidence suggests this will not be the route Amorim takes.",
      "Kobbie Mainoo missed Friday's training session but Amorim was hopeful he could return to play a role vs Everton. Mainoo's role so far this season has been from the bench but with Cunha potentially absent he could be recalled.",
      "Slotting in alongside Casemiro, Mainoo would then allow Bruno Fernandes to move further forward. It is clear the captain would prefer to play more advanced if the choice was given to him.",
      "Alongside Amad, you could then keep Mbeumo in the false nine position. This would provide United with a strong attacking threat and plenty of creativity in the final third.",

      "Senne Lammens wore a polo shirt and a navy sweatshirt when he visited Old Trafford after signing for Manchester United. The young goalkeeper looked as though he could be joining United to work in their HR department.",
      "The same observation was made when Lammens reported for international duty with Belgium last week - the 23-year-old was dressed in a beige collared jacket, a khaki t-shirt and chinos.",
      "\"By accident, I saw an article saying he was wearing something boring when he reported for international duty and fans saying they hoped he stays like this,\" laughed Hayk Milkon, one of Lammens' former coaches.",
      "\"This 'boringness' is just the way Senne is, he's really calm and no excesses. He focuses on what he needs to focus on and is open with the people around him. He keeps his feet on the ground.\"",
      "If Lammens looks like someone who could work in an office, every workplace would love to have him in their five-a-side team. United believe they have signed a young goalkeeper with huge potential, and fans who were present at Old Trafford against Sunderland left the stadium buzzing about his debut.",
      "The quirk is that Lammens appears to be a different person when he wears his goalkeeper kit. He made a supremely confident United debut, aggressively commanded his area and kept a clean sheet.",
      "Milkon coached Lammens during their time together at Club Brugge. Milkon is now the youngest manager in the Belgian top-flight and Lammens plays for the biggest club in England.",
      "\"It was Senne with his headphones on. He would go into the gym to do his recovery or some extra top-ups. Or he would just go to relax by playing basketball - he loved to play basketball.\"",
      "Milkon coached in different roles at Club Brugge. He was the assistant of Club NXT (their reserve team), served as their interim manager, was in charge of the Under-18s and eventually became a first-team coach.",
      "His time at Club Brugge coincided with Lammens progressing from the academy to their first team, so he is uniquely positioned to provide insight into United's new goalkeeper signing.",
      "Lammens joined Club Brugge's academy when he was 12. \"He was a guy with huge potential,\" said Milkon. \"As I learned from colleagues who had worked with him when he was much younger, I heard there was a moment that clicked in his head when he became super professional.",
      "\"He was one of the guys during Covid - when the players were not able to train - who was doing a lot at home, he was really going far with this to be the best in these types of areas.",
      "\"Then he continued like this when he joined the first team to train with them. He always wanted to improve. We also had something in place to look at the parameters on which goalkeepers are judged.",
      "\"You see the potential of the goalkeeper based on what they do in games; so their positioning, their decision-making and so on, and Senne was always quite high in these areas.",
      "\"The only bad luck that he had was that the first-team goalkeeper was Simon Mignolet. He's an amazing goalkeeper, so it was difficult for Senne to stay over there in the role of No.2.",
      "\"That would have also blocked his growth, so it was good for him in the end to make the step to go to Antwerp and he did a tremendous job there. It was amazing to see how fast he adapted.\"",
      "Milkon continued: \"I think for us at Club Brugge, it was very clear to everyone that Senne was a top goalkeeper. He would have been the perfect fit for Club Brugge to be the No.1.",
      "\"That was not possible because Mignolet was there. But the parameters that we used to judge his performances indicated he was ticking so many boxes already, and he was consistently doing it.",
      "\"There weren't ups and downs with his performances. He was consistently really high and when you compare this to the top goalkeepers, you have a benchmark to say 'Ok, what potential does this guy have?'",
      "\"He had some chances with the first team at Club Brugge and made a mistake, or maybe two, but in the end it was very clear to everyone that he was a top goalkeeper.",
      "\"It was impossible to try to extend his contract because, again, you have Mignolet, and you cannot block a guy like this. You know he has to go out, he has to play, and he will improve even more.\"",
      "When asked about Lammens' strengths, he said: \"I would say that his decision-making was very good. He is very calm, he sees the solutions on the pitch, he has a quick reaction time and understands the balance between risk and reward, and which decisions are the right ones to make.",
      "\"His clean passing is great, his footwork was really good, and he's just an amazing goalkeeper with the shot-stopping. He made some incredible saves back then already. He's quite a complete goalkeeper.",
      "\"But making the right decisions at a very young age, being very mature with this, was really impressive. And the fact that he is good with both feet is another big strength.",
      "\"For me, Senne is a very calm guy and has all the qualities to be a top professional. That was my impression when I first met him when he was younger and he never changed.\"",
      "Lammens joined Royal Antwerp on a free transfer in the summer of 2023. He was handed his debut a few months later and served as an understudy that season, but earned first-choice status for 2024/2025.",
      "His performances drew attention from the Belgian media. Lammens saved four penalties across a successful first full campaign and received a call-up to Belgium's senior squad in March.",
      "Milkon said: \"I was not surprised when I saw Manchester United had come calling. And to record his first clean sheet, I was really happy for him. Senne is a potential No.1 for the Red Devils - the Belgium national team.",
      "\"He got his chance, he took it, and we're all really proud of him, but we knew it would happen. I believe he has all the capabilities to become the best in the world, so I wish him all the best. I'm sure he will have a very good career in England, and Manchester United should return to the big club they used to be.",
      "\"He will have a positive impact on that, for sure, and hopefully he will be Belgium's first-choice goalkeeper soon. I believe he has the potential, the skillset and the personality to do that.",
      "\"For me, it was just having a tiny little part in having an influence on him at Brugge, but it was the most positive memories of our relationship that we had during this spell.",
      "\"I'm very proud that he is reaching these high levels and not surprised. I believe he will be successful because he is a guy who will not change his focus or start to do something different. He is calm, that's his personality and character, and he wants to succeed. He is hungry and will keep working to be his best.",
      "\"He is so calm, and you have to be patient in football. You cannot worry too much and want things too early, but finding the balance between not being impatient and, at the same time, pushing and demanding what you deserve in a good way, means everything will sort itself out.\"",
      "United staff who have worked with Lammens at Carrington have echoed Milkon's sentiments. He has been described as \"really mature for his age\" and is said to have taken the move in his stride.",
      "Lammens is understood to have impressed coaches during training sessions and a United source said that lots of people have been speaking positively about him. He has already relocated from the luxury hotel where he was initially staying and into a house.",
      "It's no surprise that Lammens likes to play basketball at 6ft 3in, but he is a keen golfer, which is common ground with the likes of Tom Heaton, Luke Shaw, Mason Mount and Harry Maguire.",
      "Matthijs de Ligt, Amad, Maguire and Shaw jogged straight to Lammens to congratulate him after full-time against Sunderland. \"Are you Schmeichel in disguise?\" was chanted at Lammens from the Stretford End.",
      "It remains to be seen whether Lammens will start against Liverpool on Sunday, but it would be a surprise to see him on the bench after delivering a strong debut before the international break.",
      "There would be nothing boring about keeping another clean sheet - this time at Anfield.",
      "Kitbag has slashed the price of Man United kits and merch with up to 50% off select items.",

      "He did not cite whipping balls into the box. Little wonder, as exactly two months later his team was breaking the record for the most crosses attempted by a team in a single Premier League game.",
      "Rene Meulensteen called the Manchester United approach “quite straightforward” and “easy to defend against”. Dan Burn had “never headed that many balls since the Conference” and was “happy for them to play like that”. Darren Bent “knew that was going to happen” and was also “happy for them to play like that,” having had as many touches in his own box as the opposition’s despite scoring a last-minute equaliser.",
      "And Moyes admitted it was “as bad as it gets”, with his P45 ultimately swung in 72 days after those 81 crosses epitomised his reign.",
      "This was worse. This was weeks of steadily building progress completely squandered, and Ruben Amorim’s most damaging proclivities coming to the fore again.",
      "It was Moyes securing his first ever Premier League win as a visiting manager at Old Trafford in 18 attempts dating back to 2002, Manchester United suffering their first ever Premier League home defeat after seeing the opposition have a player sent off, and Everton not failing to have a single shot after their goal, but instead rather sagely identifying the distinct lack of any need to try.",
      "They had Idrissa Gueye dismissed for a baffling moment of self-destruction in the 13th minute but produced a performance of determined grit and organised obduracy which had both managers praising the infighting post-match.",
      "MORE ON THE MANCHESTER UNITED MESS FROM F365\n👉 Neville slammed for ‘thinking he’s second coming of Guardiola’ with verdict of ‘ambling’ star\n👉 Amorim ‘furious’ with two stars for ‘completely disregarding instructions’ vs Everton\n👉 Ruben Amorim ‘asking for’ sack with Manchester United tactics v 10-man Everton",
      "“I quite like when my players have a fight,” said Moyes, resisting the obvious temptation to say only that the situation would be handled internally. “I don’t want them to accept someone not doing well enough.”",
      "“I hope my players, when they lose the ball, they fight each other,” Amorim added.",
      "But when the Portuguese also describes it as “my fault” that said players “didn’t understand the moments of the game during the 90 minutes,” and that he needs to better “explain to the players how to play in every situation of the game,” it is difficult to see how Casemiro scrapping with Matthijs de Ligt over a misplaced pass would help.",
      "At least Jose Mourinho controlled the “brain” if not the body of only Luke Shaw, the manager “making every decision” for a player who “cannot play with my understanding of the game”.",
      "Amorim has taken on that responsibility for an entire team which apparently cannot think for itself even when confronted by an opponent with one win in four games, reduced to ten men for 77 minutes and without a win of any kind at that stadium since December 2013, during the mess of the Moyes season when it felt like a team would record their first win at Old Trafford in decades every other week.",
      "If this group needs a coach to issue reminders about the need to raise their intensity and diversify their course of attack somewhat against a team down one player then it is yet again difficult to envisage quite how this arrangement ultimately works.",
      "Manchester United put in 38 crosses against Everton, bringing into question Amorim’s claim about having spent the international break watching what opposition managers do before coming to the conclusion that James Tarkowski and Michael Keane might struggle under an aerial assault.",
      "That is not even close to touching those absurd numbers posted against Fulham but still nine more than their previous season high across 120 minutes on that miserable evening at Grimsby, and their most in a Premier League game since October 2018.",
      "That was when Mourinho was to be sacked regardless of the result delivered against Newcastle, only for Alexis Sanchez to grant him a stay of execution with a last-minute winner in a wretched game.",
      "Mourinho was finally shown the door 73 days later, lasting about 24 hours longer than Moyes after he bore those 81 crosses.",
      "Perhaps that represents a harbinger of doom for Amorim, whose rollercoaster would finally end on February 5 going by that timeline. Manchester United’s last match before that execution date being at home to Fulham is almost too narratively satisfying.",
      "This was every bit as desperate as those displays under patently doomed managers, every inch as uninspiring a gameplan and reaction. That it was so thoroughly exposed by Moyes, long but no longer the poster boy for Manchester United’s era of sustained failure post-Ferguson, was most damning of all.",
      "The list of things Manchester United must improve remains painfully long more than a decade later; despite that slight recent upturn, the manager is still towards the top of it after all these years.",
      "Ruben Amorim earned himself a little time with an unbeaten Manchester United run, but that defeat to Everton was rotten.",
      "Rio Ferdinand has claimed that the recent record of Arne Slot at Liverpool “reads like” Ruben Amorim at Manchester United, as he wants to see the Reds boss “rinsed” like ...",
      "Thomas Frank is learning quickly that focusing on eliminating risk can in its own way be the biggest risk of all. Especially at Spurs.",
      "Senne Lammens should have stopped Everton’s winner, while Jordan Pickford denied Man Utd to make it an England one-two at the top…",
      "‘Vinicius Junior seems unhappy at Real Madrid’ so we imagine he will leap at the chance to join Manchester United if he watched them lose at Everton.",
      "According to reports, Manchester United head coach Ruben Amorim was “absolutely furious” with two of his players for their performance against Everton."

      "FBREF explains that positive numbers suggest better luck or an above-average ability to stop shots.",
      "Including only those who have played three or more games, here’s how the Premier League shot-stoppers are performing this season.",
      "And here’s who was the best goalkeeper in 2024/25.",
      "",
      "Henderson had serene outings against Brentford, Brighton and Wolves, keeping consecutive clean sheets as Palace firm up again. The England keeper will doubtless fancy himself as Thomas Tuchel’s No.1 in USA next summer. Any chance?",
      "",
      "… Not with Pickford in his form. Consecutive clean sheets and a string of saves at Manchester United, who failed to score from a PSxG of 1.8, see the Everton stopper climb here. Pickford just needs to avoid a crash in form to cruise into the World Cup as Tuchel’s No.1.",
      "",
      "Spurs being wretched against Chelsea wasn’t bad news for everyone at Spurs – Vicario padded his stats by conceding just one from a PSxG of 3.2. But six goals conceded in the draw with Manchester United and the miserable north London derby defeat came from a combined PSxG of 4.6.",
      "",
      "Replacing clean sheet machine Trafford at Burnley, Dubravka has made a very solid start at Turf Moor. Which is handy since he has faced more shots than any other goalkeeper. Might already have save of the season tied up after preserving Burnley’s win at Wolves in the dying seconds but should have done more to prevent West Ham’s second and third goals.",
      "What a save from Dubravka 🧤 pic.twitter.com/YmY4Lq2abB",
      "",
      "Verbruggen’s rotten record last season didn’t stop him once again being linked with the likes of Bayern Munich in the summer. In recent weeks, the Dutchman looked more like a goalkeeper who might catch the eye of the big boys after a shakier start to the season and the late, win-preserving penalty save against Brentford sees him climb here.",
      "",
      "Fat lot of good topping this list after the first three games did Trafford. This is likely to be his number for the rest of the season unless Gianluigi Donnarumma suffers a misfortune.",
      "",
      "Sunderland fans have been raving about Roefs after his start to life on Wearside and everyone else is starting to see what the fuss is about. Only Dubravka has made more saves and no-one has a higher saves percentage (79.2%).",
      "",
      "The massive Italian has emerged as City’s undisputed No.1 to the shock of no one and the horror of James Trafford. Donnarumma has made a solid start to life in the Premier League but showed for the first time against Bournemouth some vulnerability to crosses.",

      "His England recall was scuppered by a concussion suffered at Brentford and a run of five clean sheets in the first seven games has been followed by none in five.",
      "",
      "Lammens dazzled United fans with some simple competency but the first questions were asked of the Belgian after Everton’s win at Old Trafford from 0.4 PSxG. Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall’s shot was within reach, but Lammens was caught off balance and forced to push off the wrong foot, reducing the distance he could dive.",
      "",
      "A big climber after matchday 12 at Bournemouth, moving from 23rd to here and into the black after conceding twice from a PSxG of 4.1. Still has some way to go to convince Hammers fans he should be their long-term No.1.",
      "",
      "Life is rarely quiet when Martinez has the mitts on. He began the season well, then tailed off quite alarmingly, but a clean sheet and a penalty save against Bournemouth was more like it. Then he went to Leeds and conceded a shocker.",
      "",
      "Last season’s joint winner of the Golden Glove award had a wretched few weeks, falling 13 places in this list before facing Leeds then Liverpool. In no game have Forest faced fewer shots on target than Arne Slot’s side managed at Anfield.",
      "",
      "Johnstone has been more reliable than Jose Sa but Sunderland’s opener cut the ex-England keeper in half; Burnley’s first took him by surprise; and he might feel he could have kept out the first of Fulham’s three. Harsh? Probably. At Chelsea, he was powerless to stop any of the Blues’ three second-half goals and it was a similar story in the defeat to Palace.",
      "",
      "It almost doesn’t matter what Sanchez does, everyone has already decided that Chelsea need an upgrade. And they are probably correct.",

      "Alisson’s return came as a relief after five games out but even he was powerless to stop Liverpool caving against Forest, who scored three from a PSxG of 2.5.",
      "",
      "Leno was bouncing back from a poor season by his own high standards with an impressive start to this campaign but defeats at Villa and Bournemouth were expensive for the German when it comes to this particular metric. Clean sheets against Wolves and Sunderland have provided a small boost.",
      "",
      "Raya faced more shots on his target at Sunderland than the previous four games combined. He kept out neither of them. Then he conceded to Spurs from their only shot on target which had a PSxG of 0.1.",
      "",
      "Literally no one views Bayindir as a credible No.1, including Ruben Amorim. Since he was dropped for Lammens, United haven’t lost. Coincidence?",

      "You have to feel for Hermansen. He seemed to be bought on the hop by the Hammers and was thrown into a team flailing badly. Taken out of the firing line now, with Areola back in under Nuno.",

      "After nearly two months of glorious respite, here we are yet again, apportioning blame for Manchester United being sh*te.",
      "The Red Devils were dire in defeat to Everton, despite David Moyes side playing all but 13 minutes with 10 men. So submissive were the hosts at Old Trafford that the Toffees literally fighting among themselves was highlighted as one of the many areas United could improve.",
      "Who is responsible for a performance that lacked minimum levels of intensity, nous and ingenuity?",
      "The short answer: all of ’em. There is enough blame to spread around all the coaching staff and squad inside the United dressing room. We’ve conducted this post-mortem many, many times before. Must we open the corpse yet again? Oh, we must…",
      "Jamie Carragher says the manager should ‘take a lot of the blame’ after sticking so rigidly to his formation, despite the events that were unfolding in front of him.",
      "“It is my fault,” said Amorim post-match, accepting responsibility in that way that managers do, when they have no intention of shouldering the blame for anything other than picking from a group of players who, apparently, cannot think for themselves.",
      "“I need to be better, to explain to the players how to play in every situation of the game.” The fact he immediately then zeroed in on those players’ for “starting the game with a different intensity” to Everton was a more accurate reflection of his mindset.",
      "This is the thing with Amorim. He is honest. Sometimes painfully so. He is so dreadful at hiding his frustration when his players fail to achieve the bare minimum that he no longer tries. Not really.",
      "It is actually quite endearing. And it almost certainly buys him more patience with Stretford Enders than his results deserve. But the credit earned by his honesty and open disdain for the players wrecking his head is almost immediately wiped out by his absolute, devout devotion to his system. Carragher called it is ‘baby’ and we hope for his actual children’s sake that Amorim is never put in the admittedly unlikely situation where he has to choose between them or 3-4-2-1.",
      "We are only left to speculate why the United players, seemingly dead behind the eyes, steadfastly remained in that very formation, with no will or wherewithal for spontaneity, after Idrissa Gueye’s early red card.",
      "It should have been on Luke Shaw or Lenny Yoro to step forward as United’s extra man, an advantage they wasted by clinging to their defensive position like a tatty comfort blanket.",
      "Was that Amorim’s insistence? Or are all of his players now so drilled in this shape that any adaptation is utterly beyond them? Tell us either is true and we would not question it.",
      "The abject inability of players to think for themselves, or even look after themselves, is a far wider problem beyond Old Trafford. Coaches preach about empowering players to find solutions in the game while simultaneously prescribing every minor movement in and out of possession. The contradiction goes all the way to academies and grassroots, leaving us with players at every level incapable of reacting to any scenario they haven’t meticulously rehearsed.",
      "The game is poorer because we forget that football is about players, not cultish coaches and their desire to show how pure and clever their philosophy is. Which, with almost no exceptions, is ripped off someone else anyway.",
      "But at the top level, it is easy to understand why coaches insist on mapping out every intricate detail, each run and pass, when they are only ever five games from the sack. If Amorim, like many managers at other clubs, was to place any of his faith in these players, he knows he is destined for a fall. So, instead, it becomes about systems, not players.",
      "If Amorim genuinely feels he must “explain to the players how to play in every situation of the game”, he’s screwed. But he doesn’t really. Yet he’s still screwed.",
      "Because after a year in charge and some glimmers of encouragement of late that must have had United players believing their own press through the international break, they can still turn up and turn in performances like this which are part of a pattern against teams in the bottom half.",
      "Slate Amorim for his system or his like-for-like substitutes, but it was clear from literally the first minute that United’s players were failing to match the intensity of their visitors, despite the chance to position themselves among the Champions League chasers. Motivation cannot and should not be spoon-fed by the manager, it has to come from within.",
      "Passing up that opportunity so meekly – or worse, failing even to recognise it – says more about this United side than the five games they went unbeaten just to remain in their rightful place: entrenched in mid-table.",
      "Ruben Amorim earned himself a little time with an unbeaten Manchester United run, but that defeat to Everton was rotten.",

      "For David Moyes and Jose Mourinho, resorting to aimless crosses marked the beginning of their ends at Manchester United. Ruben Amorim is repeating history.",

This misses the point that managers resign from jobs incredibly rarely, unless they have another job to go to, because they can stay and be paid to leave. That looks unlikely in Slot’s case because there doesn’t seem to be an obvious replacement out there for him.",
      "It would be a bold decision on his part to leave at this very moment. The Premier League is mad this year in terms of how bunched up so many teams are. To use Crystal Palace as an example, before this season their best points return after 12 games was 19 (six wins and one draw, 2015-16), which put them in 10th place, and the only other time they’ve won as many as five games (with two draws), 2020-21, had them 11th with 17 points.",
      "This year, with five wins (and five draws), they have 20 points and are 5th, one point behind Aston Villa in the final Champions League place. The three-point gap between Villa and Liverpool is comparable to the equivalents (final playoff place to 13th) in the Championship, League One and League Two, all of which are infamously built on shifting sands. It’s entirely conceivable that if Liverpool could turn things around in very short order and be right back in the mix for the top four. Automatic Champions League qualification would constitute a successful season (if not a successful title defence).",
      "* Speaking of bold decisions to leave a club, Saturday saw Rob Edwards take charge of Wolves for the first time. Now, maybe it’s just me but I’ve never understood why people, and it tends to be a certain type of British manager more than most, would leave an environment where they are building something special and overachieving to move up the pecking order to a basket case club where it is incredibly likely they will fail. Graham Potter is a strong example here, leaving Brighton to go to a chaotic Chelsea where he was found to be out of his depth in fairly short order. His reputation took a hit and, following his time at West Ham, hasn’t really recovered.",
      "Edwards, meanwhile, has just left a Middlesbrough side he got well on course for promotion to join a club looking incredibly likely to pass them going the other way. His old side have lost just two league games so far this season, his new side have lost all bar two. It will be a truly remarkable feat if Edwards can keep Wolves in the Premier League, but it’s easy to think his best chance of managing in the Premier League beyond this year would have been to stay with Boro.",
      "* One of the reasons supporting Crystal Palace is rarely dull for long is that they keep defying expectations. That’s probably why so many of us expected them to lose to a Wolves team they should, on paper, beat comfortably. Instead, we were treated to the sort of professional performance that shouldn’t be an issue but too often is. Palace were, by some distance, the better team on Saturday afternoon and their win, combined with results elsewhere, took them temporarily to fourth in the table (they’ve since been overtaken by Aston Villa).",
      "* During the international break the Athletic published two articles about Palace, one discussing their struggles to break down a low block and the other about how they had never won the first game back from an international break under Oliver Glasner. This, and the game against Wolves, highlight why Glasner is so well-liked amongst the fans in a way that many of his predecessors weren’t. He gets that it won’t be perfect, because it’s Palace, but he gets a lot right. He’s a planner but he’s also has good judgement about when to change the plan or when to stick to it.",
      "The only concern fans do have is that he is exacerbating the lack of squad depth he has previously commented on by not rotating players or leaving it late to make substitutions. His first change on Saturday, Eddie Nketiah on for Jean-Philippe Mateta, was a subtle tactical shift even if it was one centre-forward for another, but a goal arrived a couple of minutes afterwards. Then, with the game at 2-0 and largely over as a contest, he waited a further 12 minutes to make any more substitutions.",
      "It’s a minor thing, but the fresh legs in midfield being introduced straight after the goal, for example, would have sent a message to those players that they were being trusted to see out a winning position for an extended period. But as I say, it’s a very minor thing.\nEd Quoththeraven",

      "Manchester United legend Wayne Rooney has revealed a “big problem” in his former side’s loss to Everton and has blamed head coach Ruben Amorim.",
      "The Red Devils crashed down to earth on Monday night as their five-game unbeaten run in the Premier League ended.",
      "Amorim‘s side hosted Everton at Old Trafford and suffered an embarrassing 1-0 loss despite the Toffees going down to ten men inside the opening 15 minutes.",
      "Idrissa Gueye was sent off in unique circumstances as he clashed with teammate Michael Keane, but Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall broke the deadlock with a stunning strike from distance.",
      "Man Utd then dominated possession, but could not equalise as Everton defended brilliantly to earn a 1-0 win at Old Trafford.",
      "“It’s always difficult against 10 men, they drop a little bit more,” De Ligt said.",
      "READ: Amorim and ’embarrassing’ Man Utd return to the doldrums vs ten-man Everton",
      "“They have four guys who are two metres at the back, so crosses are going to be difficult.",
      "“I think we lacked the patience to play between the lines and play on the floor. I think we crossed a lot of balls but obviously they are really strong in that aspect. But still we have to do a lot more than this.”",
      "In response to these comments, Rooney explained what Man Utd’s “big problem” was against Everton.",
      "“They were certainly favourites to win the game tonight and Everton going to 10 men, you think they’re going to kick on and win the game comfortably,” Rooney said.",
      "“I think, as De Ligt just said there, they forced too many balls, they were crossing the balls at times when they didn’t need to cross it. If they’d stayed a bit more patient and pulled Everton out of position…that was a big problem for them tonight.”",
      "Rooney also criticised Amorim, who should have “changed the system” to help break Everton down and did not need to keep Leny Yoro and Luke Shaw on the pitch.",
      "He added: “I would like to see them change the system.",
      "“I know Luke Shaw and Leny Yoro were stepping in and trying to add an extra player in midfield. But when you’ve got an extra player, having a more creative player in his natural position would have made the difference.",
      "“I think Ruben Amorim and the Manchester United players will be really disappointed with tonight’s performance.”",
      "Ruben Amorim earned himself a little time with an unbeaten Manchester United run, but that defeat to Everton was rotten.",

      "After the game, Amorim gave a damning assessment of his side’s performance, insisting “Everton were the better team” on a hugely “frustrating” night for him and his players.",
      "“After the sending off, I was expecting us to have long periods of possession and to push the opponent. We didn’t control the transitions, even with 10 men. We were giving them big spaces to win second balls, so the understanding of every situation in the game was not there.",
      "“The quality around the box is another big thing, but more importantly it was the intensity we showed. We cannot win games in this way.”",
      "On whether the performance surprised him after a good run of form, Amorim added: “Of course it did. I understand that we still have a lot to do, but I’m really frustrated with how we handled the game. Especially knowing that we were playing at home, knowing what happened to the other clubs, looking at the table and feeling everything.",

      "A porous midfield, weak defending, questionable goalkeeping, predictable and repetitive attacking patterns, toothless forwards and 3-4-2-1 doubts. Welcome back, Manchester United.",
      "It wasn’t Graeme Le Saux vs David Batty and frankly pathetic in comparison to the shirt-ripping majesty of Kieron Dyer vs Lee Bowyer, which meant that rather than being treated to a joyous “they’re having a fight?!” line on commentary, everyone but referee Tony Harrington was initially confused as to exactly why Idrissa Gueye had been given his marching orders at Old Trafford.",
      "We’re absolutely here for a footballer being sent off for slapping one of their own teammates. It’s far more gratifying than them striking a member of the opposition, not least in this instance because we were treated to David Moyes’ wonderful post-match revelation that “I actually like my players fighting”. Lovely stuff.",
      "It’s a weird rule though. Gueye wouldn’t have been sent off for an accidental studs-up challenge over the ball on Keane, for example. Nor for denying him a goalscoring opportunity.",
      "It felt like a crushing blow at the time for Everton, who had been very, very comfortable up to that point in the 13th minute against a Manchester United side who had offered little but have looked like a semi-serious football team for the last couple of months.",
      "An attacking midfielder finding space behind the United double-pivot, taking advantage of some weak defending and then scoring past a limp-wristed goalkeeper who failed to get off the ground is vintage pre-October 2025 Manchester United.",
      "Quite how Everton, a side hardly famed for their ability to pop the ball around with 11 men, albeit with an uptick in possession this season under Moyes, were able to open up that space for and find Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall without a Manchester United player getting anywhere near any of them in the build-up was again, classic rock-bottom stuff from the Red Devils.",
      "Bruno Fernandes was weak, Leny Yoro weaker still and goalkeeper extraordinaire Senne Lammens got his timing all wrong to make what was a half-decent turn, touch and shot from Dewsbury-Hall look like the work of a world-class playmaker.",
      "And it had been coming. Not because of any sort of barrage on Lammens’ goal from the visitors, but because United afforded them absurdly easy possession, sleeping through 15 minutes after Gueye’s dismissal. After which, significantly, David Moyes didn’t feel the need to sacrifice one of his forwards to replace one of the Premier League’s foremost midfield destroyers, such was the lack of threat from the home side.",
      "An increase in Manchester United pressure in the second half came mainly in the form of delivering crosses towards two Everton centre-backs famously accomplished at dealing with balls in the air and two or three United players, whom Gary Neville listed one after the other with a “can’t head it” suffix.",
      "Without Benjamin Sesko and Matheus Cunha through injury, Amorim turned to Mason Mount, Kobbie Mainoo and Diogo Dalot to change the game in United’s favour. But he steadfastly refused to even tweak his much-maligned system, to Neville’s bemusement.",
      "“Still didn’t win the first ball, or the second – embarrassing,” Neville said as Thierno Barry set the season-record for aerial balls won (14) from a Jordan Pickford long ball as United lined up with their customary five in defence. But the majority of the co-commentator’s wrath was reserved for Luke Shaw.",
      "He’s got one pace, summed up by Neville when he spotted him “ambling forward” from left centre-back, rather than bombing on as you might expect when marking no-one for 80 minutes of a game of football. “What he’s doing is a waste of time,” Neville added of a footballer who did once, admittedly a while ago, get to the byline and deliver crosses.",
      "Yoro has never been that guy and that was made very clear by his staunch refusal to cross the ball from the inside right position on any of the 427 occasions he was handed the opportunity.",
      "Pickford produced one sublime save to deny Joshua Zirkzee, who fluffed another couple of headers, and Bruno Fernandes missed a clearcut chance for United. But while it felt frantic, that energy came from United, not Everton, whose defenders dealt expertly with the balls into the box as Dewsbury-Hall, Jack Grealish and Iliman Ndiaye worked tirelessly to drag them up the pitch, win free-kicks and relieve pressure whenever possible.",
      "A brilliant performance from Everton and a significant reality check for Amorim, whose greatest concern will be how easily his Manchester United side reverted to their 2025 norm, while very familiar frustrations over the manager’s refusal to adjust his system no matter the circumstances will rear their ugly but entirely reasonable heads in the aftermath.",
      "Ruben Amorim earned himself a little time with an unbeaten Manchester United run, but that defeat to Everton was rotten.",
      "Rio Ferdinand has claimed that the recent record of Arne Slot at Liverpool “reads like” Ruben Amorim at Manchester United, as he wants to see the Reds boss “rinsed” like ...",

      "Ruben Amorim has told wantaway players that “Manchester United comes first” but is retaining those players actually in the club’s best interests? Particularly if, as Amorim himself insists, “it’s impossible to manage a dressing room like that”.",
      "In a World Cup year both Kobbie Mainoo and Joshua Zirkzee are very keen on loan moves in January. Mainoo is yet to start, making seven substitute appearances in the Premier League; Zirkzee has featured for just 82 minutes.",
      "Asked about their futures ahead of Monday night’s clash, Amorim was adamant that he wouldn’t consider their exits if it would hinder Manchester United.",
      "“The first thing is that the club comes first, so we have to think about the club and the team, and then everything can happen,” said Amorim.",
      "“I was a football player, I understand everything, and I want to help my players in every situation, so I don’t know what is going to happen.",

So if I can help the club and the players, I will be happy, if not I have to think about the team.”",
      "It’s up for debate whether Manchester United players who are not playing football is what’s best for the club, not least because their values will be plummeting ahead of next summer if – as looks very likely to be the case – they’re set to be sold as ill-fitting parts in Amorim’s system.",
      "And quite why Amorim has one rule for Rasmus Hojlund and an entirely different one in the cases of Mainoo and Zirkzee is unclear.",
      "Asked if the club made a mistake in allowing Hojlund to leave the club in the summer on the back of Benjamin Sesko’s injury, Amorim insisted him staying would have made the dressing room “impossible to manage”.",
      "He added: “Imagine that Rasmus is here, and you say: ‘If Ben has an injury, you have more time to play’. It’s impossible to manage a dressing room like that, so that’s why we need to improve the kids from academy.",
      "“If you have an injury that is the opportunity for them, and then to have players that can play in different positions, for us to manage the team in a better way.”",
      "Amorim also claimed Chido Obi was promoted “too soon” last season and the 17-year-old wasn’t named in the squad on Monday despite the injuries to Sesko, and Matheus Cunha, whose absence was all but confirmed by Visit Altrincham’s superb bombshell press release on Saturday evening.",
      "“Unfortunately Matheus Cunha has had an accident in training today and will not be able to attend tonight’s Christmas Lights Switch on in Altrincham due to medical reasons.”",
      "United are two forwards down, as they will be again next month when Amad Diallo and Bryan Mbeumo both leave for AFCON. And while Zirkzee and Mainoo’s game time has been limited in a season bereft of football owing to them not competing in Europe and being dumped out of the League Cup by Grimsby Town, the first real injury problem for United sees Zirkzee in the starting lineup.",
      "Given Amorim’s preference for using Mainoo further forward, the academy graduate will hope that no Mbuemo or Amad, and maybe others through injury, will see him play his part in the busy winter weeks, and perhaps stake his claim for more regular game time when they return.",
      "Whether or not that is the case, Amorim is absolutely right not to let these players leave the club, even if it is giving him an “impossible” dressing room to manage. Others do it relatively easily, mate.",

      "Semenyo, 25, is set to be at the epicentre of a Premier League bidding frenzy. The 25-year-old, whose explosive start to the 2025-26 season has yielded six Premier League goals – trailing only Erling Haaland (14), Igor Thiago (9) and Danny Welbeck (7) – is the subject of serious interest, with approaches ‘imminent’, per sources.",
      "Tottenham, under Danish tactician Thomas Frank, are poised to act decisively. Frank, who once hailed Semenyo as Bournemouth’s “main threat” during his time at Brentford, is eager to elevate Spurs’ attacking firepower amid their goal-shy campaign.",
      "With Richarlison one goal behind Semenyo’s tally, insiders say Spurs are READY to match the £65million release clause in Semenyo’s contract, which activates in January but expires on a fixed date, allowing Bournemouth time to sign replacements.",
      "This clause, down from a £70million summer valuation, represents a bargain for a player whose counter-attacking prowess has terrorised defences.",
      "However, TEAMtalk understands that United’s interest has intensified, bolstered by an unlikely ally: Bournemouth technical director Simon Francis, a lifelong Red Devil.",
      "Francis is set to pitch Old Trafford’s vision to Semenyo, positioning United ahead of rivals despite their summer pivot to Matheus Cunha. Ruben Amorim views the versatile winger as the missing spark in a squad craving dynamism, with a bid in advanced planning stages…",

      "As the release clause looms, this saga could redefine mid-window dealings, with Semenyo’s 2024-25 haul of 11 goals and five assists underscoring his elite trajectory.",

      "“The salary he has right now is a salary that Man Utd don’t want to pay in the future. Not because of Casemiro or Maguire, but because they want to change the salary structure.",
      "“So at the moment, for Casemiro, the only way to stay would be a different contract, a different salary. Otherwise, he could be free next summer to go wherever he wants.",
      "“He always had a lot of interest, especially from Saudi Arabia. So, after his excellent performances recently, Casemiro obviously will have many clubs interested.",
      "“At the moment that’s the situation with Casemiro. Nothing is guaranteed in terms of a new contract because of the salary, so either they find a solution on the salary structure together otherwise Casemiro could be leaving Man Utd in summer 2026.”",
      "According to respected journalist David Ornstein, a £44m Manchester United transfer is not as ‘close’ to being completed as it initially appeared.",

      "Arsenal are still hot favourites despite conceding a couple of actual goals at Sunderland, while the silliness literally everywhere else sees Tottenham in the top six despite having five points from six games at home, and newly promoted Sunderland sat looking down on three of the Big Six a quarter of the way through the season, just like everyone predicted.",
      "Manchester United’s redemption has taken Ruben Amorim out of immediate contention, with Vitor Pereira a clear frontrunner before Wolves decided to get rid.",
      "That put Nuno Espirito Santo and West Ham in clear and present danger of both seeking their third appointment of the season already, but he’s pulled off a couple of wins to ease those fears. Even Nottingham Forest have been a different beast under Sean Dyche, and it all leaves Daniel Farke under the harshest glare of the Sack Race spotlight.",
      "Meanwhile, here are possible replacement managers currently between jobs.",
      "",
      "An earlier version of this oft-updated piece speculated on what might happen to Mikel Arteta should Arsenal suffer from their Nightmare Start. What if they lost a few early games? What then? We concluded this:",
      "It’s far likelier that Arsenal emerge blinking into the autumn sunshine broadly unscathed from their nightmare horrors. No denying that this season does represent one in which Arteta might completely lose the plot and go entirely off the rails. Or the one where he wins the league by 10 points. Feels like we’re odds-on to get one or the other.",
      "Arsenal emerged duly unscathed, and have already cashed in on the shift to easier fixtures of their own alongside much tougher ones for Liverpool to take top spot in the Premier League.",
      "Only question that remains, therefore, is what Arsenal do from here. We are absolutely certain that it either involves p*ssing the league by 10 points or a complete and total meltdown. Nothing in between is acceptable or even conceivable. And it really is looking more and more like it’s the first one.",
      "READ: Who will be the next manager of Arsenal if Mikel Arteta is sacked?",
      "",
      "A sacking remains out of the question despite last season’s (relative) struggles. There hasn’t been a Premier League manager since Fergie in his pomp with more credit in the bank than Pep.",
      "But is there still a distinct chance Guardiola decides he’s had enough and simply walks away? We reckon there is, and it’s always worth remembering that we’re talking Next Premier League Manager To Leave here, and that the traditional ‘Sack Race’ shorthand is a bit misleading.",
      "Still, though. Almost no chance at this point that any of that could happen swiftly enough for nobody else to have been canned first. Even if defeat at Newcastle does raise the serious prospect of a second consecutive season without a meaningful title challenge.",
      "",
      "One of the key early-season imponderables for 25/26 was just how big and what kind of impact the Club World Cup might have on the way Chelsea and Man City start the season. Would they hit the ground running, or would they be a bit tired and out of sorts? For both, it’s been a little from column A, a little from column B.",
      "Maresca definitely still has some hearts and minds to win at Chelsea despite the fine finish to the season that saw them tick off Champions League qualification while completing their collection of UEFA pots and pans and then winning the actual Club World Cup.",
      "A home draw with Crystal Palace wasn’t ideal, but the paddling dished out to West Ham has what really should at least be some kind of halfway credible title bid up and running at least. And we strongly suspect Fulham won’t be the last team left scratching their head after losing to Maresca.",
      "There was some talk of ‘Maresca out’ after a draw with Brentford but that was surely only a minority view. After losing to Manchester United in shambolic fashion, there were more on the bandwagon.",
      "That win over Liverpool was big, though, and a particularly good one for Maresca himself. The second half thumping of Forest was handy, too, albeit inevitably saying far more of their opponents than it did of Chelsea. Home defeat to Sunderland saw awkward questions resurfacing, but it’s been three wins from three since then to leave Chelsea quite incongruously second in the league.",
      "",
      "Doing so well that even suffering the ultimate embarrassment of defeat at Old Trafford hasn’t dampened spirits for the most impressive promoted club in quite some time.",
      "Five wins in the bag already, a seven-point lead over Newcastle, and more points than Southampton managed in the entirety of 24/25. Widespread expectation that tougher games would bring Sunderland back down with a bump have thus far proved wide of the mark; there won’t be many teams unhappy at taking four points from two games against Chelsea and Arsenal this season.",
      "",
      "The continuity candidate in the summer, and looked to have received the ultimate hospital pass. How much continuity could there be at Brentford given they’d sold Bryan Mbeumo, Yoane Wissa and Christian Norgaard, while Thomas Frank took most of the remaining coaching staff with him to Tottenham? It was a very Brentford move to promote from within and we’ll hold our hands up and admit we thought it would go far, far worse than it has.",
      "With Newcastle added to Liverpool and Manchester United on the list of Gtech victims this season, it’s an undeniably impressive start in trying circumstances.",
      "",
      "Funny old season for Emery already. Began the campaign right at the outside of this market with your Artetas and – unlikely as it now sounds – Slots. Then jumped right up to third favourite when Villa’s rankling disappointment at how last season ended leaked into a six-match winless start to this campaign.",
      "But then along came four Premier League wins in a row to thoroughly lift the mood at a club where a few short weeks ago it really did feel like they’d come to the end of something special without ever getting the definitive moment of success it deserved.",
      "That run is now six wins in seven Premier League games and has lifted Villa right through the mid-table slop and up into the top four. Three wins in four have a distinctly winnable Europa League campaign bubbling along nicely, too. An astonishing shift from what felt like an inexorable downward spiral not that long ago.",
      "We could all learn something from that, but we won’t.",
      "",
      "Among the least sackable managers in the top flight, and the only club we could really picture trying to lure him away this summer was Spurs and that’s now safely off the table.",
      "It was a difficult summer for Bournemouth but Iraola had masses of credit in the bank that can get him through things like getting inexplicably pumped 4-0 at goal-shy Villa without too much fuss.",
      "",
      "Won’t be sacked, obviously, because Palace are absolutely punching with an elite-level manager who is quietly delivering astonishing results in trying circumstances.",
      "But with reports he was willing and ready to walk out if Marc Guehi was sold without a replacement point to new strains on a relationship that is bound to be tested in the weeks and months ahead.",
      "Nailed it in the Community Shield, but as ever for clubs on Palace’s level there’s a positive-and-negative scale to be balanced by your manager catching the eye so conspicuously. Glasner absolutely could be poached with bigger beasts surely paying attention to the work he’s done at Selhurst Park.",
      "And if that poaching comes from outside the Premier League, then it comes with the possibility of making Glasner the next Premier League managerial casualty. But still very unlikely.",
      "We’d imagine the significant lowering of the threat level for a Ruben Amorim Sack at United has eased some nerves at Selhurst Park considerably.",
      "",
      "Fine end to 24/25 put a different complexion on Brighton’s season than at one time appeared likely. Ending up a clear best of the rest outside the quickly established top seven represented at least a passing grade and they’d have to make a truly awful start to the season to get in any kind of managerial-change bother.",
      "The win over Newcastle to go with victory at Chelsea to go with a win over City reaffirms Brighton’s big-boy-bothering calibre, but does also make some of their other results – draws with Fulham and Wolves, for instance – a bit annoying.",
      "Still, though. Top six after 12 games is fine work whichever way you slice it.",
      "",
      "Forget everything we ever wrote about Ruben Amorim being doomed; he has engineered a 2-1 win at Anfield and that becaome three wins in a row after a rollicking good fun 4-2 win over Brighton.",
      "A quite silly 2-2 draw against Forest was probably a bigger setback for that lad off the internet whose long-overdue haircut is once again as far away as ever than it was for Amorim, who was backed when things were going appallingly and isn’t about to get canned now they’re going really quite well. Could probably have done without another silly 2-2 draw at Spurs to follow it, but at least it wasn’t yet another defeat against a ferociously mediocre Spurs team that has become the scourge of the Manchester clubs for some reason.",
      "",
      "Has done more than could ever have been expected given the chaos he walked into. That epic pants-pulling at Anfield surely leaves Dyche as safe as any manager ever can be in Mr Marinakis’ lair.",
      "",
      "Sounds preposterous, but there really is a non-zero chance Moyes gets punished for easing Everton’s immediate relegation fears and they seek some more enterprising football from a squad that is, in fairness, capable of that. Does feel like a very familiar Everton story, though, and one that ends with them 16th, chastened, and bringing in another firefighter.",
      "We are treating the Brendan Rodgers links with mountains of salt.",
      "",
      "It is still early days and still too early to tell which way a vaguely-promising-but-not-flawless start eventually breaks for Frank and Spurs. But it’s starting to look likelier it breaks the wrong way for the manager.",
      "He arrived to a club and squad with an awful lot of mess to sort out at history’s funniest ever Champions League qualifiers. He appeared to have already thoroughly De-Anged the lot of them only for them to then turn up against Bournemouth and defend like an Ange team while attacking like a Mourinho one.",
      "You know who else won their first couple of games, including one against Man City, after stepping up to Spurs from a smaller but less daft Premier League club? That’s right. But while the Nuno comparisons are obvious, it doesn’t quite feel like the same situation despite some rumblings of discontent.",
      "Crucially, there was no undignified scramble to find a new manager this time. Whatever your thoughts on the timing and manner of Ange Postecoglou’s sacking and the identity of his replacement, it’s also clear Spurs have got the man they wanted in a way they very obviously didn’t when Nuno came in.",
      "But it’s certainly starting to look uncomfortably similar in familiar ways; the small-time approach to big London derbies against Chelsea and Arsenal has not been well received and the fear grows that he just doesn’t understand what this job requires. The fact almost no manager in Premier League history has managed to understand what this job requires is cold comfort at this time.",
      "",
      "Seven points from three games against Newcastle, Burnley and Bournemouth leave things looking far comfier than might have been expected for a manager who, when the Magpies took an early lead at the London Stadium, looked to be heading for a second sack of the season long before the Christmas decorations went up.",
      "",
      "A simply huge and wildly unexpected win over Manchester City. Had Newcastle lost that, as all pre-interlull indications suggested they would, then the spotlight would have been harsh indeed on Howe and his team. They would at that point find themselves slap bang in the muck of a relegation scrap; instead they have lifted themselves back into the mid-table morass where – luckily for them – absolutely nobody is any good at all and the chance of re-establishing themselves in there and even emerging out the top is very real indeed.",
      "There are multiple reasons for Newcastle making such a sticky start to the season and very few of them are directly the fault of a man who did deliver the club’s first trophy in bloody ages last season. That one seismic result against City had vast implications for the title race – in that it confirms there almost certainly won’t now actually be one – but was so big for Newcastle and their manager themselves.",
      "",
      "Burnley really did have a horrible fixture list in these opening weeks under a manager with a horrible record at this level, and were given an opening-day reminder by the team that finished 17th last season of just how much harder the ‘simply don’t concede any goals at all’ tactic might be to deploy in the Premier League.",
      "Essentially, Burnley have got back to this level the same way Homer Simpson got to a heavyweight title fight. And Spurs and City have already given them a pummelling.",
      "Victories over Sunderland and Leeds were an impressive and necessary reminder that it might still be enough against teams more on their level, and while a 3-2 win at Wolves was not exactly The Burnley Way it’s still three points against an established – if struggling – Premier League side.",
      "But for all the talk of an encouraging fight from the promoted teams this time around, two of the three now find themselves in the bottom three after a run of three straight defeats. And that quickly builds pressure.",
      "",
      "Backed in to a hot favourite as the whispers began before the international break. And it might be time to accept something is fundamentally broken here as a relegation fight bubbles up in what’s shaping up to be a really bad season to lose your mid-table mojo.",
      "Still think both club and manager would live to regret parting ways, but it’s a dicey time.",
      "",
      "Impossible to avoid the conclusion that Slot’s reaction to Liverpool’s mini-crisis becoming actual-crisis was poor. He went Full Klopp with his salty loser behaviour when Manchester United committed the crime of altering their tactics to give themselves the best chance of success against Liverpool, and the headloss continued after another chaotic and unstructured performance led to a 3-2 defeat at Brentford.",
      "Having ticked ‘opposition doing tactics wrong’ off his rattled manager bingo card, he can now add ‘losing his mind over entirely uncontroversial refereeing decisions’ with his response to both the Cody Gakpo non-penalty and Virgil van Dijk penalty at the Gtech.",
      "It has to be a worry for Liverpool that Slot has for the first time in his Anfield career found himself under any kind of pressure after a chastening run of defeats, and has suffered severe and instant headloss as a result.",
      "Funny to think of a manager who’s just beaten Real Madrid in the Champions League being under threat, but defeat at the Etihad was miserable before Nottingham Forest came along and achieved the amusing feat of being the first team to shut Liverpool out in the Premier League at Anfield since Nottingham Forest.",
      "Liverpool are now, hilariously but unacceptably, in the bottom half of the table only a few short months after completing a run of five straight wins to begin the season. They, and Slot, just look unbelievably rattled.",
      "",
      "Surely doomed now, and the hard-nosed yet valid argument persists that Leeds could and perhaps should have taken drastic action in the summer. It would have made Spurs’ decision to sack Europa League-winning Ange Postecoglou look positively kind, Leeds – and Burnley for that matter – might now be better off had they thanked the managers who secured 100 Championship points and got them back into the big time and then sent them on their way.",
      "Farke had a dreadful Premier League record of only six wins and 26 points from his 49 games in charge of Norwich, a team he twice led to promotion from the Championship with 94 and 97 points.",
      "As well as fighting his own record in this competition, Farke faces the added burden of expectation levels very different to those at just about any other club that could possibly find itself promoted into the Premier League in this current era where that represents the most bittersweet of successes.",
      "Defeat at Burnley was honking, but bouncing back to win another six-pointer against West Ham eased the stress significantly before a paddling at Brighton and events elsewhere – including West Ham themselves – left Farke desperately short of immediate cover before a desperately poor show in a six-pointer at Nottingham Forest.",
      "Another painful defeat having gone in front, against Villa this time, sees Leeds drop into the bottom three ahead of a brutal run of games, with Man City and Chelsea next before some hope of respite against mid-table Liverpool.",
      "Ruben Amorim earned himself a little time with an unbeaten Manchester United run, but that defeat to Everton was rotten.",
      "Rio Ferdinand has claimed that the recent record of Arne Slot at Liverpool “reads like” Ruben Amorim at Manchester United, as he wants to see the Reds boss “rinsed” like ...",

      "Who carries the can for Man Utd being so docile in defeat to Everton? Ruben Amorim’s rigidity did not help, but the players’ passiveness spoke volumes…",

      "We really think they might be f***ing this up. Having cantered to the Premier League in bizarrely unchallenged fashion last season, they seemed all set to make a right go of defending their title after signing everyone they could get their hands on (although maybe some defenders would have been an idea) and then winning all of their first five games.",
      "Since then, though, it’s played six, lost six in the Premier League as a five-point lead at the top of the table has become an 11-point deficit. Arsenal have zoomed beyond them, but so too have a truly hilarious and motley collection of other clubs that encompass all the Premier League has to offer.",
      "The mini-crisis is now absolutely massive, and even if Liverpool do sort themselves out in due course – as surely they must – their title chances already look lost.",
      "Long way to go, of course, but it inevitably sets the mind a-thinking about a) other rubbish Premier League title defences and thus b) whether or not there are enough of them for us to scrape together a vaguely justifiable 10.",
      "Fair warning, the answer to b) is probably ‘No, there is not’ even with last year’s City shenanigans to help us on our way. The top half of this list has some undeniable doozies, but we’ve had to be slightly dickish about teams who finished second before we get to that good stuff. Sorry about that. Sure you understand.",

Never before in the Premier League era had United suffered such indignity, and to do it the season after Ferguson had rowed back on his first retirement decision as well.",
      "Not only that, but United managed to make a pig’s ear of everything that season, going potless for the first time in four campaigns. They went out of the League Cup early to Arsenal, didn’t get past the fourth round of the FA Cup and even the saving grace of a run to the Champions League semi-finals ended in the painful ‘what if?’ of away-goals defeat to Bayer Leverkusen.",

Conte spent much of the season in a funk after not getting his way in the transfer market, which is out of character, isn’t it?",

Rovers led from the front, relinquishing top spot for only a couple of games from the start of November, even if they did their best to hand the title to United during the run-in.",
      "But they could not sustain it. Rovers, reeling from the resignation of Dalglish as manager, finished a distant seventh the following season while winning just one of their Champions League fixtures in a European campaign that is best remembered for David Batty and Graeme Le Saux coming to blows in Moscow. Kicked off the season by losing the Charity Shield to Everton in a game we just had to look up, it having been completely erased from memory, and were also bundled out of the FA Cup in the third round.",

      "Jurgen Klopp’s Reds finally ended their 30-year title drought in stunning fashion, overcoming a pandemic and 103-day period between their 29th and 30th matches to gather a club-record 99 points, sealing their 19th championship with seven games to spare – beating the previous best by two matches.",
      "While there are mischief-makers who like to pretend this season comes with an asterisk, we should all really be grateful that the absurd armies of Premier League football fans who see conspiracy and subterfuge everywhere have so little to go at in that interrupted season. Liverpool had it nailed down long before the pandemic shut the country down.",
      "Not the biggest thing about the pandemic, sure, but imagine the nonsense we’d all have had to put up with had it happened during one of the daft title races where Liverpool narrowly missed out to City.",
      "But they couldn’t maintain their stunning form after ending that title drought. The Reds were breaking all the wrong records the following season, with a 1-0 loss to Fulham being their sixth consecutive home defeat – their worst run ever. But Klopp’s beleaguered side rediscovered some grit, if not necessarily their best form, to win eight of their last 10 matches and sneak a Champions League place while all around them floundered.",
      "Mitigation abounded in the form of injuries to key players and the perhaps inevitable release and relief of finally scratching that 30-year itch. Getting close to that 99-point tally again was always asking a lot, but 70 shouldn’t have been unreasonable.",
      "",
      "Seems harsh to put this so high and close to the genuinely catastrophic attempts at defending a Premier League title.",
      "But we’re also in victims-of-own-success territory here, and while it may seem harsh to judge City differently it’s also unavoidable. Guardiola’s consistency means he is alongside Fergie as the only Premier League manager who doesn’t get the mitigation that everyone else gets; that defending a Premier League title is really bloody hard.",
      "If you go around making that really difficult task look as straightforward as those two did, then it’s going to be so much more jarring when it does all go to sh*t for a season.",
      "Even now, only a year on, it’s easy to forget just how vast and unshakeable the aura around Pep’s City was. The absolute certainty everyone felt that no matter how awkward a position they might get into during the first half of the season, they would simply steamroller everyone in the second half.",
      "That’s what an unprecedented four straight English league titles does to everyone else. Especially when it’s Arsenal who have been noisily coming second in the last couple of them and insisting it is literally impossible to do any more.",
      "Yet slowly at first and then very fast indeed, it became apparent during the autumn of 2024 that City were not going to save themselves this time.",
      "In a two-month spell from October 30 to December 29, City played 13 games across three competitions and somehow won only one of them.",
      "And it all began after a run of five straight wins, that came to an abrupt end with a 2-1 Carabao defeat at Spurs (genuinely, what is it with City and f*cking Spurs? It makes no sense). A Premier League defeat at Bournemouth was followed by a Champions League humbling at the hands of Ruben Amorim on his Sporting farewell tour, before another 2-1 defeat at Brighton and then a 4-0 thrashing at the hands of, yes, f*cking Spurs (How? Why?).",
      "Perhaps the lowest point of the run came in the Champions League when failing to see out a home game against Feyenoord despite leading 3-0 with barely a quarter of an hour remaining.",
      "But it’s title defences we’re really interested in, so while the wider context of the overall run that scuppered them in three competitions is fun, we should try and stay focused. That league run at its worst point was one win, two draws and six defeats in nine games that took City from top of the table and two points clear of Liverpool to seventh and trailing by 12.",
      "Recovering to limp home third because everyone else was sh*te doesn’t really make it okay.",
      "",
      "United recovered from losing the 2011/12 title race to AGUERRRROOOOO to bounce back and secure their 20th championship in Ferguson’s final season in charge at Old Trafford. The signing of Robin van Persie was the catalyst, with the former Arsenal striker scoring 26 Premier League goals as United eased home by 11 points in a far cry from the final-day goal-difference antics of the previous season.",
      "Then Ferguson left, urging United supporters to ‘back your new manager’. A few months later, a plane was flying over Old Trafford proclaiming ‘Wrong One – Moyes out’. By the time Moyes was finally, inevitably sacked in April, with four games remaining, United were already guaranteed to record their lowest points tally in the Premier League era, with home games a particular problem.",
      "Under Moyes, United were beaten six times at Old Trafford, losing in the FA Cup to Swansea, while Sunderland dumped them out of the League Cup. It led to United missing out on Champions league football for the first time since 1995 as they finished a lowly seventh and 25 points worse off.",
      "The absence of Ferguson/presence of Moyes is quite understandably cited as the main reason, but United absolutely butchered the transfer window as they discovered for the first but not last time that Ferguson really had been making their life unbelievably easy by winning what he did with what he had.",
      "Ed Woodward’s failure to bring the desired and requested Gareth Bale, Toni Kroos and Cesc Fabregas certainly didn’t help matters. Although he did, in his first season in big boy pants, manage to overpay for Marouane Fellaini in the final hours of the summer window.",
      "And then Moyes railed against the fixture schedule after the champions were made to play Chelsea, Liverpool and Man City in their first five matches: ‘I find it hard to believe that’s the way the balls came out of the bag, that’s for sure,’ he tinfoiled, having apparently confused the fixture computer for the FA Cup third-round draw.",
      "",
      "Jose Mourinho first disproved the theory that you should never go back by winning a third Premier League title in the second season of his second reign at Stamford Bridge. New arrivals Diego Costa and Cesc Fabregas immediately flourished, with Eden Hazard providing the inspiration in a 2014/15 season which saw him crowned PFA Player of the Year.",
      "Mourinho then set about reproving the theory by setting the ultimate benchmark for his now infamous Third-Season Destroy And Exits. The tone for a pathetic title defence was set on the opening weekend, when Mourinho took aim at Chelsea’s medical staff for doing their jobs. The fall-out hung over Stamford Bridge long after Mourinho was fired in mid-December, at which point the Blues had lost nine of their 16 league matches to leave them languishing a point above the relegation zone.",
      "Guus Hiddink, as he tends to, steadied the ship and a top-half finish following the club’s worst start to a season in 37 years became a creditable achievement for Roman Abramovich’s favourite firefighter. But a 37-point drop-off from one season to the next is really very bad indeed no matter how you slice it.",
      "Obviously, they then won the league the following season because the Premier League was, although we didn’t yet know it, undergoing a few years of utter and glorious weirdness before Pep Guardiola would come along and tame it thoroughly.",
      "The mounting evidence that such chaos appears to be returning to the Barclays is something we should all welcome.",
      "",
      "Claudio Ranieri’s Foxes stunned everyone by going from great escapees under Nigel Pearson in 2014/15 to 5000-1 Premier League kings the following year. In the end, it was a procession, with a 10-point margin of victory. The greatest story ever told in English football? Probably.",
      "The Foxes, understandably, suffered quite the hangover from Jamie Vardy’s party and a summer basking in their stunning achievement. N’Golo Kante’s exit hardly helped. They reached the Champions League quarter-finals, but by that time, Ranieri had paid for a miserable title defence with his job. The Italian was axed after just five wins in 25 league games, with his champions one point above the drop zone.",
      "Craig Shakespeare inspired some improvement and Leicester won seven of their last 13 to finish in 12th.",
      "",
      "To our immense relief, this one sneaks in on a bit of a technicality. It might not be a Premier League title defence, but it was a title defence in the Premier League era and we’re cheerfully loopholing off into the sunset with our fingers in our ears. We can’t hear you.",
      "One of the reasons we want this in is just purely and simply that it means one less Actually Kind Of Okay Defence at the other end of this list. The main one, though, is that it was a really bad defence.",
      "Howard Wilkinson’s Whites, inspired by the February arrival of Eric Cantona, broke Manchester United’s hearts down the final stretch of the last Division One season by unseating the Red Devils, who had led from the front through most of the season. Some Leeds fans will argue that their four-point triumph was a bigger miracle than Leicester’s, with Wilko taking United from 10th in Division Two to English champions within three years.",
      "Leeds’ slide as champions was certainly even more dramatic than Leicester’s. During the Premier League’s inaugural season, Wilko’s champs failed to win a game away from Elland Road. They finished 17th in a 22-team division, only two points above relegated Crystal Palace and 31 down on their title-winning effort the year before football was invented. The European Cup offered little respite. They survived the first round after Stuttgart fielded one foreign player too many, only to be beaten home and away by Rangers in the next.",
      "According to reports, Liverpool have ‘made a decision’ on whether to sack head coach Arne Slot after their 3-0 loss to Nottingham Forest at the weekend.",
      "Rio Ferdinand has claimed that the recent record of Arne Slot at Liverpool “reads like” Ruben Amorim at Manchester United, as he wants to see the Reds boss “rinsed” like ...",
      "Thomas Frank is learning quickly that focusing on eliminating risk can in its own way be the biggest risk of all. Especially at Spurs.",
      "For David Moyes and Jose Mourinho, resorting to aimless crosses marked the beginning of their ends at Manchester United. Ruben Amorim is repeating history.",
      "Senne Lammens should have stopped Everton’s winner, while Jordan Pickford denied Man Utd to make it an England one-two at the top…",
      "‘Vinicius Junior seems unhappy at Real Madrid’ so we imagine he will leap at the chance to join Manchester United if he watched them lose at Everton."

      "Luke Shaw came under fire as Man Utd's defeat to Everton raised more questions of Ruben Amorim's system; Gary Neville on Luke Shaw against Everton: \"He's ambling. You can't do that. He should be running forward every single time\"",
      "By Nick Wright, Oliver Yew and Adam Smith",
      "Tuesday 25 November 2025 15:06, UK",
      "Gary Neville slammed Luke Shaw's lack of intensity as Manchester United slumped to another low under head coach Ruben Amorim with their 1-0 defeat to 10-man Everton.",
      "The 30-year-old, playing as the left-sided centre-back in Ruben Amorim's back three, was singled out for \"ambling\" forward as Manchester United tried, and failed, to recover from a goal down.",
      "Shaw is one of four Manchester United players, along with Matthijs De Ligt, Bruno Fernandes and Bryan Mbeumo, to have started every Premier League game this season. It has been a rare period of availability for a player dogged by fitness issues.",
      "Last season, he only completed 90 minutes once in the Premier League, having only done so seven times in the campaign before that. You have to go back to 2022/23 for the last time he managed to feature consistently across a full season.",
      "Staying fit has proved a major challenge for Shaw.",
      "Once a marauding full-back with the energy to shuttle between the two boxes, his physicality is not what it used to be. His lack of intensity against Everton riled Neville with Manchester United trailing against 10 men and needing a goal.",
      "\"You have Shaw, [Leny] Yoro and [Matthijs] De Ligt behind the ball,\" he said on co-commentary. \"Shaw is getting forward more, but he's ambling forward, let's be clear. He's been bugging me for the last 20 minutes. He's ambling. You can't do that.",
      "\"He should be running forward every single time. I don't care. Yoro, I have a little bit more sympathy for but Shaw? That's a waste of time. I don't care. It's not conning anybody. I'm not having it.\"",
      "Shaw's physical decline can be seen in the numbers. There is a caveat in that he has been used in a role which requires less running under Amorim, as a centre-back rather than a full-back, but the drop-off in many areas predates the head coach's arrival.",
      "Shaw's sprints and kilometres covered per 90 minutes have followed a downward trend and his attacking output has also declined.",
      "Shaw has steadily contributed fewer crosses, goal involvements and chances created over the course of the last five seasons.",
      "Gary Neville says Manchester United's performance in the 1-0 defeat to 10-man Everton \"smelt of complacency\" and will \"erode trust\" in Ruben Amorim's team.",
      "Despite Shaw's limitations, Amorim's system once again came under intense scrutiny.",
      "Still trailing, Amorim made changes to try and get back into the game, bringing on Diogo Dalot for Patrick Dorgu and Kobbie Mainoo for Casemiro. They were like-for-like substitution as the United boss left Shaw, De Ligt and Yoro on the pitch, sticking with his three-at-the back system for the full 90 minutes.",
      "It was a move that left many Man Utd fans frustrated, particularly bringing on the right-footed Dalot to play in front of Shaw as the pair ended up getting in each other's way on Manchester United's left side.",
      "\"You have to have urgency and make the pitch as big as possible, and you have to put as many players as possible in forward areas,\" said Neville.",
      "\"Ruben Amorim has a question to answer,\" he added.",
      "\"Bringing Dalot on over there in front of Shaw? I don't quite see it. You have five at the back, why? Embarrassing.",
      "\"This should be like the Alamo. Really quick, high-tempo passing side-to-side, getting into good wide areas, putting crosses in, getting bodies in attack, sustaining attacks. It's very slow from United. There is no presence in the box whatsoever.\"",
      "Once again, Amorim being wedded to his 3-4-3 formation and his reluctance to change in-game proved costly for United. His devotion to playing three at the back has come to be seen as a flaw, especially when trying to chase games.",
      "Questions will be asked again of Amorim and his flexibility. It's hard to see why he kept his three central defenders on the pitch and didn't throw extra attackers on against Everton when it was obvious they were lacking a focal point in the absence of the injured Benjamin Sesko and Matheus Cunha, something which was also highlighted by Jamie Carragher after the game on Monday Night Football.",
      "\"Ruben Amorim feels like the first manager I've seen who sticks with a system rather than an idea of how to play,\" Carragher said. \"It feels like the formation is his baby and to not change it or alter it in certain situations like that [against Everton], I don't understand how you can stick with it so steadfastly.",
      "\"If you have to stick with the system, put a midfielder in defence, which we have seen managers do in the past, because you are going to have so much of the ball.",
      "\"It's not about losing the three points against Everton, I think it is one of those moments where people will really question the manager. He will take a lot of the blame.\"",
      "Amorim still has Lisandro Martinez to return from injury. The Argentina international will likely slot back into the left-sided centre-back role, but Shaw looks unsuited to playing at wing-back and Amorim's other options are also underperforming.",
      "At Sporting, his wing-backs were attacking outlets vital in making his system work. In his final full season in charge, in 2023/24, Nuno Santos, Geny Catamo and Ricardo Esagio, his three most-used wing-backs, contributed a combined total of 26 goals or assists between them in league games alone.",
      "Amorim's wing-backs at Manchester United have contributed half as many goals or assists across a similar number of league games.",
      "And nine of their 13 goals and assists, roughly 70 per cent, have come from Amad Diallo, with the others used in the position, Dorgu, Dalot, Noussair Mazraoui, Harry Amass and Tyrell Malacia, only managing four between them in a combined 67 starts at wing-back.",
      "The struggles of Amorim's wing-backs raise further questions about Amorim's devotion to his system. If they are not contributing offensively, then what are they really bringing to the table?",
      "It is just one of many questions for their under-fire head coach, who can add Shaw's decline to a growing list of problems.",

      "With Everton down to 10 men for over 75 minutes after Idrissa Gueye's red card for striking his own team-mate Michael Keane, Amorim's side failed to break down a team who have only mustered one away win all season - against bottom side Wolves.",
      "It was the first time United have ever lost a home Premier League game after seeing the opposition pick up a red card, with United winning 36 of the 46 games in which it has happened before. It was also David Moyes' first ever win at Old Trafford as an opposition manager at the 18th attempt.",
      "But overall, it represents a new low for Amorim, who celebrated one year in charge of United in dismal fashion.",
      "\"We are not there, not even near the point that we should be to fight for the best positions,\" said Amorim.",
      "\"We have a lot to do. We have to be perfect to win games, we were not perfect today.",
      "\"When we see the results of the weekend, we should get onto the pitch with a different excitement. Old Trafford was there saying 'we are all here for a big step up'. And we were not ready.",
      "\"These five weeks, everyone is praising our evolution. But I'm always saying the same things: we are nowhere near the moment we are meant to be in this club.\"",
      "Gueye's bizarre red card left Amorim wishing he had seen the same sort of fight from his own players.",
      "\"Fighting is not a bad thing,\" he added. \"Fighting doesn't mean you don't like each other. Fighting means you lose the ball and I will fight you because we will suffer a goal. That was my feeling.",
      "\"I don't agree with that red card. We can fight with team-mates. I know it's violent conduct because the referee explained but I don't agree.",
      "\"I hope my players, when they lose the ball, they fight each other - though they cannot get sent off! But that is a good feeling, not a bad feeling.\"",
      "Amorim also admitted he is concerned about returning to the feeling of last season - which ended in a 15th-place finish, no trophies and no European football for this season.",
      "\"I feel afraid of returning to this feeling of last season,\" said Amorim. \"That is my biggest concern. We need to work together. The players are trying but we need to be better.\"",
      "Gary Neville branded United's performance as an \"embarrassment\" at Old Trafford - while Jamie Carragher feels Amorim's credentials will be questioned on the basis of that performance.",
      "Amorim was criticised throughout the match for not moving away from his much-maligned 3-4-2-1 formation and continuing with five defenders on the pitch, despite having the player advantage.",
      "\"It was nowhere near good enough,\" said Neville on the Gary Neville Podcast. \"That was a really bad night for Man Utd, it was an embarrassment at times.",
      "\"Forget [injuries to Sesko and Cunha], there are no excuses. I'm not entertaining that one bit.",
      "\"Everton dominated them with 11 men and with 10 men, in a different way of domination, but they dominated them through their fight and their spirit.",
      "\"It's complacency, and complacency will kill you. The minute that you think as a football player that you just have to turn up on that pitch and you're Manchester United and you can play or any football club, you're done.",
      "\"It just smelt of complacency [from United]. They weren't at it from the beginning. That is a bad one for United.",
      "\"You can't go from the fight that they showed in certain games to that. It just erodes confidence, it erodes trust. We're trying to build a trust in a manager, we're trying to build a trust in a team.",
      "\"The fans booed collectively at the end. It was loud, and rightly so. That was a really poor performance. It's almost as if you've gone sort of like two or three steps forward, everyone's feeling a little bit better about themselves, and you've just gone back to the start again.",
      "\"You can lose football matches, but you can't lose them like that. That's nowhere near good enough, it's not acceptable.\"",
      "Carragher added: \"This is a bad night for the manager. There was an awful long time left in that game [after 10-man Everton went ahead].",
      "\"I don't understand how you can stick with something so steadfastly in a situation like that when it's basically one guy up front who's not really up front, you don't need three players [at the back] there.",
      "\"It's one of those moments where I think a lot of people will really question the manager on the back of that defeat. They'll look at the players, and we know the players should do better, but the manager will take a lot of the blame for tonight.\"",

      "Ruben Amorim's Manchester United era hit a new low as they lost 1-0 to an Everton side playing over 75 minutes with 10 men after Idrissa Gueye's red card for striking team-mate Michael Keane.",
      "In extraordinary scenes at Old Trafford, Gueye got into an argument with centre-back Keane early in the first half and replays showed the midfielder raise his hands to the Everton defender's face. Gueye apologised to his team-mates at full-time.",
      "That moment should have allowed United to completely control of the game - if anything it did the opposite. Amorim's side looked like the team with 10 men - and Everton deservedly took the lead through Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall's stunner from distance.",
      "The midfielder's solo run got him to the edge of the box before he fired past Senne Lammens' outstretched gloves and into the net - with more questions falling to a United goalkeeper this season.",
      "United failed to take full advantage of their extra man in the first half, with their players booed off after their best chance was a Bruno Fernandes 30-yard strike which Jordan Pickford simply saved.",
      "United - missing Benjamin Sesko and Matheus Cunha through injury - started the second half in a similar vein. Half-time substitute Mason Mount put two chances wide, while Bryan Mbeumo saw an effort saved by Pickford.",
      "\"You have five at the back, why?\" said Neville. \"They still don't win the first ball or second ball. Embarrassing.",
      "\"The subs have taken him down a cul-de-sac. There's no agility or flexibility firstly from the coach, but also the players.\"",
      "Man Utd: Lammens (4); Yoro (5), De Ligt (5), Shaw (3); Mazraoui (4), Casemiro (3), Fernandes (4), Dorgu (4); Amad (4), Zirkzee (3), Mbeumo (5)\n\n\nSubs:  Mount (4), Dalot (4), Mainoo (4)\n\n\nEverton: Pickford (9); Coleman (n/a), Tarkowski (8), Keane (8), Mykolenko (7); Gueye (1), Garner (7), Dewsbury-Hall (9); Ndiaye (8), Barry (8), Grealish (8) \n\n\nSubs:  O’Brien (7), Beto (n/a), Iroegbunam (n/a), McNel (n/a), Alcaraz (n/a)\n\n\nPlayer of the Match:  Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall",
      "United almost found a way through when Joshua Zirkzee, starting his first United game for 225 days, forced Pickford into two wonder saves, before he then headed a Kobbie Mainoo cross wide.",
      "More boos rang out at full-time as former United coach David Moyes got his first win at Old Trafford as a visiting manager. For Amorim, this is a massive low.",
      "\"Frustration, disappointment with the way we played the game. They were the better team with 11 men. They defended really well with 10 men for 70 minutes. We deserved to lose. We didn't play well, with the right intensity.",
      "\"We are not there, not even near the point that we should be to fight for the best positions. We have a lot to do. We have to be perfect to win games, we were not perfect to win games.",
      "On the Everton red card: \"Fighting is not a bad thing. Fighting doesn't mean they don't like each other. Fighting is if you lose the ball, I will fight you because we will suffer a goal. That was my feeling with that red card.",
      "\"I don't agree with that sending off. We can fight with team-mates. I know it's violent conduct, the referee explained it, I don't agree with that. I hope my players, when they lose the ball, they fight each other. I hope they don't get sent off, but that is a good feeling not a bad feeling.",
      "\"My players showed in many games we can do it. Today, we didn't. I need to help them. We need to be better in the future.\"",
      "\"It's complacency, and complacency will kill you. The minute that you think as a football player that you just have to turn up on that pitch and you're Manchester United and you can play or any football club, you're done.",
      "\"It just smelt of complacency. They weren't at it from the beginning. That is a bad one for United.",

      "\"You can lose football matches, but you can't lose them like that. That's nowhere near good enough, it's not acceptable.\"",
      "\"If nothing happened, I don't think anyone in the stadium would have been surprised. I thought the referee could have taken a bit longer to think about it.",
      "\"I got told that the rules of the game that if you slap your own player, you could be in trouble.",
      "\"But there's another side to it: I like my players fighting each other, if someone didn't do the right action. If you want that toughness and resilience to get a result, you want someone to act on it.",
      "\"I'm disappointed we get the sending off. But we've all been footballers, we get angry with our team-mates. He's apologised for the sending off, he's praised the players and thanked them for it and apologised for what happened.\"",
      "\"Rollercoaster game. I'll sleep well tonight, put it that way. So genuinely happy for the lads and how hard they worked. A fantastic performance of gritting away, getting a goal and keeping that spirit. So glad we got the three points.",
      "\"We started really well - the situation happened. It was a moment of madness, avoidable. But all I can say is Idrissa has apologised to us at full-time, said his piece and that's all he can do. We move on from it. The reaction from us, was unbelievable. Top tier. We could have crumbled but if anything, it made us grow.",
      "On what Moyes said at half-time: \"He just said: that's done now. We'll deal with that another time.",
      "\"It was about keeping to the plan we had. He made sure we do the right things, continue what we're dong, we can't change that now, in the second half we continued to do that.\"",

      "Tuesday 25 November 2025 07:18, UK",
      "Everton midfielder Idrissa Gueye was sent off for striking team-mate Michael Keane just 13 minutes into the Toffees' remarkable Premier League win at Manchester United.",
      "The incident was sparked when Gueye - who misplaced a loose pass towards Keane in the penalty area to give the ball away - began berating his team-mate.",
      "Gueye then raised his hand to Keane's face before he was sent off for violent conduct by referee Tony Harrington.",
      "Despite his sending off, Everton went on to win 1-0 thanks to Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall's 29th-minute goal, and afterwards Gueye apologised to his team-mates in the changing room and released a statement on social media.",
      "He wrote on Instagram: \"I want to apologise first to my team-mate Michael. I take full responsibility for my reaction.",
      "\"I also apologise to my team-mates, the staff, the fans and the club. What happened does not reflect who I am or the values I stand for. Emotions can run high, but nothing justifies such behaviour. I'll make sure it never happens again.\"",
      "However, Everton boss Moyes said he \"likes his players fighting each other\" when asked about the incident.",

      "\"How much venom was in that slap?\" said Neville. \"He has been sent off for that. Was it a little slap or a proper whack?",
      "\"There is no doubt a hand comes out to the face but it didn't look too much. They might have had to send him off purely because there is a strike to the face.",
      "\"They were not fighting, it wasn't a scrap. It could have been dealt with by a yellow. I don't think it needed to be a red.\"",
      "Jamie Carragher said at half-time in the Monday Night Football studio: \"I just think: can a referee manage the situation a bit better?",
      "\"Can you get the two of them together and say: 'Hey can you behave yourselves?' Just sort of manage the situation, rather than that's the rulebook.",
      "\"The rulebook gives the referee a bit of an out. He could say: 'I don't think it's over the top' and then you can carry on 11 vs 11.\"",
      "Monday Night Football guest Roberto Martinez, the Portugal head coach, agreed with the red card decision.",
      "The ex-Everton boss said: \"Clearly, it's a misunderstanding; Gueye is trying to play the ball [to Keane], but it's that reaction, the slap.",
      "\"The referee has no other choice because the law tells you that any aggression above the neck is a red card.\"",
      "According to the Premier League rules, striking an opponent or any other person on the head or face with their hand or arm represents violent conduct, unless the force used was negligible.",
      "\"Was it negligible?\" pondered Neville. \"That's the question. I think it was negligible. I don't think there was much in that at all.\"",

      "When Bowyer and Dyer clashed in 2005, the former was handed a seven-game ban in total - an initial four games for it being his second red card of the season, before the FA handed an additional three matches to the suspension.",
      "Bowyer was also given a £30,000 fine, with the midfielder then leaving for West Ham in the following summer.",
      "Meanwhile, in 2008, Stoke striker Fuller was sent off for striking his captain Andy Fuller. The striker claimed the situation actually helped team morale. Fuller stayed at Stoke until 2012.",
