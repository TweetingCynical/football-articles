      "Bournemouth boss Andoni Iraola has subtly hinted at his future plans amidst swirling rumours linking him to the managerial position at Manchester United. Ruben Amorim's tenure at Old Trafford has seen plenty of speculation around his future, with the rumours intensifying in recent weeks.",
      "The Red Devils have only managed to secure two victories from their first six Premier League matches, suffering three losses in the process. United's 3-1 loss to Brentford in the Premier League last weekend has only fuelled the rumour mill regarding Amorim's future at the club.",
      "Several names have been thrown into the hat as potential successors should Amorim depart during the current season.",
      "Since taking the reins at Bournemouth in 2023, Iraola has garnered much praise for his tactical abilities and influence on the Cherries.",
      "Iraola has now shed some light on his managerial philosophy, which could provide a clue as to what might transpire should United come knocking.",
      "\"It's not just a one-season thing, you have to be there to stay and get results with the teams that you have. As I've said before, if you don't have good players, it's going to be very difficult.",
      "\"The players that are here are the most important thing of this game, and I'm very happy with the teams I've coached before and with the team that I have this season.\"",
      "United's next match will see them host Sunderland at Old Trafford in the Premier League, where three points will be the target for Amorim and Co.",
      "The Red Devils currently sit 14th in the top flight with seven points and will be eager to secure their first triumph since defeating Chelsea a fortnight ago.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

The Reds are hoping to clinch just their third win of the season against the Black Cats following last weekend's disappointing 3-1 defeat at Brentford.",
      "Amorim had been optimistic that the 2-1 triumph over Chelsea could mark a turning point, but the Reds were brought back down to earth with a loss at the Gtech Community Stadium.",
      "This is identical to their tally at this stage last season - a total that ultimately led to Erik ten Hag being sacked and replaced by Amorim as the club's new head coach.",
      "United fans are now hoping that Amorim will face the same fate as Ten Hag if the Reds fail to overcome Sunderland at Old Trafford on Saturday afternoon.",
      "This sentiment was expressed in response to a post on United's Instagram account, which previewed the club's next match with the caption: \"A chance to right the wrongs of the weekend [flexed bicep emoji and red circle emoji].",
      "In the comments section of United's post, numerous fans expressed their frustration with Amorim and called for the board to take action if Saturday's result does not yield three points.",
      "One said: \"If we don't win, he has to go.\" Another wrote: \"With Amorim.. we loseee everyweek.. sack Amorim & kick out Bruno.\"",

      "Gary Lineker has heaped praise on Manchester United loan duo Marcus Rashford and Rasmus Hojlund following their impressive Champions League displays on Wednesday evening. Rashford, 27, maintained his superb recent run with an assist for Barcelona in their clash with Paris Saint-Germain. The England star delivered a pinpoint pass to former Manchester City striker Ferran Torres, who coolly finished past the PSG goalkeeper.",
      "Following a sluggish beginning to his spell in Catalonia, Rashford has now netted twice and registered five assists across his previous six outings under Hansi Flick. Looking back at Rashford's Barcelona journey so far, Lineker believes it has been \"encouraging\" to witness him featuring regularly for his new team.",
      "Speaking on the Rest Is Football podcast, he said: \"I think Marcus has started well at Barcelona. He's getting a lot of football. People were saying, 'he's not going to get a game.'",
      "\"Obviously you're always going to get little knocks and injuries to certain players, and he seems to be rotating quite a lot, but Marcus has started a lot of games in the Champions League.",
      "\"Of the three goals that Barcelona have scored, he scored two of them and assisted the other one– really good pass. Good start, I think it's encouraging. You can see they really like him.",
      "\"Even at the weekend– I mean his assist at the weekend was in the league, it was a corner, but all the players ran to him. It's a really good sign. You need that. I'm pleased.\"",
      "As for Hojlund, he netted twice for Napoli during their 2-1 triumph over Sporting CP. The Danish striker opened his account after latching onto a superb delivery from Kevin De Bruyne before slotting past the keeper.",
      "De Bruyne then provided another assist as his delivery was nodded home by Hojlund for his second of the evening, wrapping up a triumphant night for Antonio Conte's men.",
      "Hojlund has bagged three goals in five outings for Napoli since his switch from United, with his other strike coming on his bow against Fiorentina.",
      "\"I know De Bruyne was brilliant in the game as well yesterday, but Rasmus Hojlund scored two goals,\" Lineker added. \"Everybody who is leaving Manchester United seems to be doing really well. But it just shows you, doesn't it?\".",
      "Both Rashford and Hojlund departed United on loan in the summer, with Antony and Jadon Sancho amongst the others to exit the Reds after Ruben Amorim made it clear they were not in his plans.",
      "Meanwhile, United return to action when they welcome Sunderland to Old Trafford on Saturday afternoon. The Reds are seeking to recover following last weekend's 3-1 loss against Brentford.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Gary Lineker and Alan Shearer have disagreed with Wayne Rooney's harsh criticism of Manchester United's players following their poor start to the season. The Red Devils' 3-1 defeat at Brentford, masterminded by Ruben Amorim, left them languishing in 14th place in the Premier League.",
      "This was their third loss in six matches, completely draining the momentum built up from a 2-1 victory over Chelsea at home. Rooney didn't hold back in his critique of the current squad, claiming many players were not worthy of wearing the United shirt.",
      "However, football pundits Lineker and Shearer weren't entirely in agreement with the former England and United captain.",
      "Speaking on the Rest is Football podcast, Lineker began by saying: \"I heard Wayne Rooney the other day being very critical of the players at Manchester United, saying they're not doing enough.",
      "\"I don't know, I just think when a club's in turmoil or when it's a bit rotten that it's not necessarily just about the players' attitudes. No one ever steps out onto a football pitch without total commitment. I mean, it's very, very rare.\"",
      "Shearer agreed with his former Match of the Day colleague, adding: \"It's been a tough environment to play at Manchester United for the last few years, and clearly now it's a tough place to go out and play. Even more so now I guess with what's going on.",
      "\"You hear the manager week in, week out, it's the same old, this, this and this, and nothing is changing. It's a tough place to play at the minute that ground, and the evidence suggests that, as you say, when anyone ever leaves they go on to do really well.",
      "\"I mean, McTominay, Hojlund, Antony, Rashford– I guess Sancho hasn't, but the majority of the players that go out, and whether they leave permanently or whether they're on loan, they seem to go and shine, don't they?\"",
      "On his BBC podcast, Rooney had said: \"This is not Man United. I don't recognise the whole football club. I don't see players fighting. I don't see character. I don't see a desire to win. I don't see ability. I don't see match winners.",
      "\"Nothing gets me off my feet. I go into a game watching, expecting, 'Okay, here we go again,' expecting the team to lose or maybe pick up a point. This is not Man United.",
      "He continued: \"I was at the football club for 13 years, and what is going on is not right. And this is not all on the manager, by the way. I'm seeing players, they're not deserving to wear that shirt, and it hurts.",
      "\"When you've been at a football club for that long and you care for the club, this is not acceptable what is going on. Man United haven't won back-to-back games for I don't know how long.\"",
      "While acknowledging the players bear some responsibility, Shearer and Lineker weren't quite as harsh as Rooney in their assessment.",
      "United are set to face Sunderland at Old Trafford in what could be another tricky match for Amorim's squad.",
      "Despite being the new kids on the block, the Black Cats are tipped by some as slight favourites, having climbed to fifth place after notching up three wins, two draws and just one defeat in their opening six Premier League games.",

      "Palmer famously supported United during his youth, around the period when Morrison was making his trio of first-team outings for United. The pair appear to share a friendship despite never featuring together or facing off during their respective careers.",
      "After making his choice, Palmer could not help but crack a smile. Online, they follow each other across social platforms, with Morrison even celebrating Palmer's maiden England call-up in November 2023.",
      "Sharing a post from the England account following their squad announcement, Morrison wrote: \"Told him he's in the next England squad, he didn't think I was being serious! Congratulations, bro, truly deserved!\".",

      "Nevertheless, he's had plenty of opportunities to observe the Real Madrid star in action.",
      "Those moments occurred as part of City's matchday squad when they clashed with Madrid on five occasions during the Champions League knockout rounds between 2020 and 2023.",
      "The first outfield player selected was Lionel Messi. He also faced City while Palmer was at the club, playing for Paris Saint-Germain during the group stages in November 2021, with the academy graduate remaining an unused substitute.",
      "Neymar, who featured in that match, too, was Palmer's next pick. However, neither he nor Messi managed to score PSG's only goal of that game.",

The Brazilian winger scored nine goals in 26 appearances during the second half of the season, helping Betis reach the Conference League final.",
      "Upon his return to England, Antony was placed in the 'bomb squad', training away from the first-team squad. He was also not part of the club's pre-season friendlies. It wasn't until the final days of the transfer window that he secured a permanent move to Betis.",

      "Sir David Beckham is showing no signs of slowing down after turning 50 as the Manchester United legend takes on a new role ahead of the 2026 World Cup. The former England captain has kept himself extremely busy since retiring from playing in 2013.",
      "He has worked on charitable causes through a number of different campaigns, launched several brands, continued his modelling career and even formed his own football team, Inter Miami.",
      "The iconic No. 7 has now teamed up with Verizon, the World Cup's official telecommunications partner, for their 360 marketing campaign before the tournament kicks off in the USA, Mexico and Canada next year. The scheme will provide their customers with thousands of complimentary match tickets, while hundreds more will win the chance to enjoy pitchside access during the tournament.",
      "Beckham is certainly showing no signs of kicking back and relaxing just yet, despite turning 50 in May. Speaking to Men’s Health about reaching that milestone earlier this year, the United hero explained: “It doesn’t bother me one bit. People are asking me about it gently, like it should be a big issue.",
      "“It’s not something that I’m worried about—as long as I’m fit and healthy and my family is healthy, that’s all I care about. For my 50th, I’m going to keep it really simple. I want good food, good wine, that’s it. All my closest friends.”",
      "Following a legendary career spanning over 600 matches for club and country, Beckham has ventured into a number of different pursuits. One such venture included founding MLS side Inter Miami in 2018, which began competing in 2020 and has since attracted superstars including Lionel Messi.",
      "The father of four also launched his eponymous Netflix documentary series in 2023, reflecting on his playing days and personal life. In the same popular documentary, he revealed an unexpected hobby by mentioning his newfound love of beekeeping, which he took up during the Covid-19 lockdown.",
      "Beckham expanded on that interest by launching his own honey-based snack company, Bee Up, this year. Aimed at children as a superfood substitute for sweets, boxes of the snacks have recently appeared on shelves across the pond, going on sale at retail giant Target.",
      "He said: \"My love of beekeeping and making my own honey began as a hobby and quickly grew into a passion. I built the hives with my sons, learned how to care for the bees, and mastered the art of harvesting one of nature’s most powerful superfoods.\"",
      "Of course, his long list of off-the-field pursuits are not for want of money. According to the 2025 Sunday Times Rich List, Beckham and his wife, former Spice Girl Victoria, have a staggering combined total fortune of £500million.",
      "Business Insider reports that the former Real Madrid Galactico had amassed an impressive $800m (£587m) by the time he retired 12 years ago. At one point, he was the world's highest-paid footballer, and his five-year contract with LA Galaxy in 2008 would be worth around £190m today.",
      "But Beckham has also boosted his personal wealth through a string of lucrative sponsorships and business deals, partnering with big-name brands such as Emporio Armani, Gillette, PepsiCo, H&M, Breitling and most notably Adidas over the years. He's even launched his own line of fragrances and lent his name to everything from sunglasses to video games.",
      "The Netflix documentary is believed to have netted the ex-footballer a whopping £20m, while he raked in a staggering £72.6m in 2023 thanks to his sponsorships and production company. He also signed a 10-year deal to become an ambassador for Qatar, which reportedly saw him paid around £125m by the country.",
      "As well as making astronomical sums from his various ventures, Beckham is known for his lavish spending, with over a dozen properties making up his remarkable portfolio, which is believed to be worth around £70m. That includes a luxury penthouse in Miami, bought for £17.5m, as well as a London townhouse valued at around £30m.",
      "He also owns a 130-foot superyacht that reportedly cost him around £16m, while his car collection is thought to be worth over £2m in total.",

The club's all-time top goalscorer, Wayne Rooney, admits that he has 'no faith' in Amorim to turn things around, ex-captain Gary Neville is 'concerned', while fellow icons Paul Scholes and Nicky Butt have urged the Portuguese to move away from his three-at-the-back formation.",
      "Amorim is fine with criticism from club legends, but he doesn't agree that his system is the problem. \"It's normal, we cannot run away from the results, and then you have the baggage from last season,\" the Red Devils boss told reporters at his pre-match press conference.",

      "Amorim was then asked if United's players understand how to play his system, 11 months on from his appointment. \"It was (disjointed against Brentford), but you cannot say one thing doesn't work, when it works one weekend,\" the 40-year-old argued.",

      "Shay Given believes Ruben Amorim has every reason to be panicking about his Manchester United future during the upcoming international break. United host Sunderland at Old Trafford in the Premier League on Saturday afternoon, with the fixture being a must-win game for the increasingly under-pressure Red Devils head coach.",
      "Despite spending considerable money on exciting new players in the summer transfer window, Amorim's men have kicked off the 2025/26 campaign just as woefully as they ended the previous season.",
      "They are currently down in 14th following the 3-1 defeat at Brentford last weekend, which marked their third league loss of the season. With the defeat coming straight off the back of a narrow win against Chelsea, the Portuguese is still yet to secure back-to-back league victories with United, reflecting the rollercoaster and emotionally taxing nature of his almost year-long tenure for everyone involved with the club.",
      "United's minority owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe and his Ineos team will have plenty to ponder irrespective of this weekend's Sunderland result, after which there's the international break. Whether they choose to stick with Amorim or cut their losses and start again with a new appointment remains to be seen.",
      "However, former Manchester City goalkeeper Given has delivered a stark warning to Amorim by emphasising how football club owners often make choices to axe managers during international breaks, claiming that's when they become \"twitchy.\"",
      "The pundit told Ladbrokes at the launch of Ladisfaction: “In terms of Amorim’s future… look, it’s Sunderland next, and you’d have to say that’s a huge game for him and the team, at home. If he doesn’t win that, then I’d imagine he’ll be under severe pressure.",
      "\"Especially because after that game, it’s Liverpool away, after the international break, and you can’t see much coming from that. And most managers will tell you, if they’re under pressure and there’s an international break coming up, you’re panicking a little bit about your future.",
      "\"A lot of owners get a bit twitchy, especially when there’s a break in the calendar and things aren’t going well… you can’t stress how important that Sunderland game is for Amorim’s future, really.",
      "“If I’m being honest, I really hope he pulls through, because he comes across as a really charismatic guy with a lot of good traits. He’s got personality, he’s got a glint in his eye which I feel like a lot of previous managers haven’t had.",
      "“But he’ll know this is a results business; it’s about getting points on the board and climbing up the table. He’s had a full pre-season with the team now and he’s been able to bring in a lot of players this summer, but we haven’t seen an improvement in results…”",
      "Amorim's future has sparked plenty of discussion in recent weeks. The sight of the despondent manager slumped on the touchline with his head buried in his hands has become the defining picture of his reign.",
      "Various reports have suggested the likes of Xavi, Gareth Southgate, Andoni Iraola and Oliver Glasner have been lined up as replacements, which, if true, would signal the end of his Old Trafford nightmare.",
      "But, for now, Amorim remains unfazed about his future at Old Trafford. He put on a brave face after the Brentford defeat and said: \"I am never concerned about my job. I am not that kind of guy. It is not my decision. I will do the best I can every minute I am here.\"",

      "Alan Shearer has cast serious doubt on Ruben Amorim's future at Manchester United, suggesting a defeat to Sunderland could lead to his dismissal, with Zinedine Zidane reportedly lying in wait for a significant managerial role. The Red Devils head coach is feeling the heat following a 3-1 loss to Brentford last weekend.",
      "Despite assurances from United's hierarchy that Amorim retains the backing of the board, speculation about his job security is intensifying. Amorim's record in the Premier League has been underwhelming, amassing just 34 points from a possible 99 since taking charge.",
      "The recent Carabao Cup humiliation at the hands of Grimsby Town prompted United's hierarchy to publicly support him. Newcastle United icon Shearer hasn't minced words regarding Amorim's stint at United, with the team languishing in 14th place in the league.",
      "\"I think if Man United lose to Sunderland he could possibly be sacked,\" Shearer said to Betfair. \"I hate talking about managers and the potential of losing jobs, but Ruben Amorim isn't helping himself, is he?\"",
      "He added: \"Things are getting worse under Amorim, which is remarkable. They certainly haven't improved, that's for sure. They're 14th in the Premier League and that was unacceptable last season.",
      "\"There were excuses for last season which maybe you could put up, but this season there's no excuse for what they've spent. I do find it remarkable that they're getting worse and nothing's changing.",
      "\"Amorim is refusing to budge from his system which, clearly, his players aren't comfortable playing. He doesn't help himself sometimes. We did a graphic on Match of the Day last weekend where he was constantly changing the back five, put Mason Mount on as a no.10 and then four minutes later changed him to a left wing-back. It looks very confusing sometimes, it really does.",
      "\"It is what it is. I don't suspect you'll get many tears from other fans. They're probably enjoying it. Amorim is under a lot of pressure, and the noise will get a lot louder if they don't beat Sunderland this weekend.\"",
      "Shearer also speculated on Zidane's next move amid reports linking the Real Madrid legend with the Old Trafford hotseat: \"I don't know what goes on behind closed doors, but I guess Zidane is sitting, waiting for a huge job where he's got the potential to go and win things.",
      "\"I don't think that potential is at Man United for a few years yet, so I'd be really surprised if Zidane was to go to Man United.\"",
      "He added: \"At the end of the day, they're Man United. One of the biggest clubs in the world and you'll always get someone who thinks they can come in and turn things around.",
      "\"But it's just been mistake after mistake after mistake and there's a part of me that believes Amorim is still in the job because of the errors that have been made by people who've come in above him. Every single corner, they've made a mistake.",
      "\"Whether it was bringing Dan Ashworth in, sacking him and putting him on gardening leave, putting ticket prices up, getting rid of staff, players they've signed. Everything seems to have been the wrong decision so I do believe the results have been nowhere near good enough and they can't wait much longer to turn them around.\"",

      "Antony has hit out at the treatment he received after being frozen out by Manchester United, accusing the club of showing a \"lack of respect\" and \"rudeness\" in his final days at Old Trafford.",
      "The Brazil winger spent the second half of last season on loan at Real Betis and made no secret of his desire to make a permanent return to the La Liga outfit during the summer. But he had to wait until the final days of the transfer window to get his wish and was effectively exiled by Ruben Amorim in the meantime, being forced to train away from the first-team squad as well as being excluded from the club's pre-season friendlies.",
      "And Antony believes that the club's approach to him and other the players in the United 'bomb squad' who were deemed surplus to requirements, such as Marcus Rashford and Jadon Sancho, left a lot to be desired.",
      "\"Look, I'm not the kind of guy who gets involved in controversies, who names people, in fact, I won't mention anyone's name here,\" Antony told ESPN Brasil when he was asked to reflect on his his final weeks as a Manchester United player. \"But I think there was a bit of a lack of respect there, even a bit of rudeness too, with no one giving you a good morning, a good afternoon.",
      "\"Not even that. But, anyway, that's in the past, I won't give much importance to these things. Now I'm here, at Betis, I'm living here, that's the most important thing for me.\"",
      "Antony followed Erik ten Hag to Old Trafford in the summer of 2022 for a transfer fee that would have surpassed £86million if all the add-ons and bonuses were met. But he failed to replicate the dazzling form he showed in the Eredivisie with Ajax and was sold for a huge loss by United to Betis after weeks of negotiations, eventually moving for just £21.65m.",
      "But while Antony believes there were mitigating factors behind his failure to make it in the Premier League, he takes responsibility for things not working out.",
      "Asked why he believed things did not go well at United, Antony replied: \"I am a man who accepts my responsibilities. I think off-field matters affected me a lot, in my performance. I know my potential, I know my qualities, I didn't play in a World Cup for nothing, I didn't return to the national team for nothing.",
      "\"I also take responsibility for it not working out, for not performing as I wanted. But I always try to see the bright side of things, going through this entire process, this time at United, was necessary to see myself.\"",

United have managed just two victories this entire campaign and find themselves languishing in the bottom half of the Premier League standings.",
      "Nevertheless, it remains unclear whether this position would shift should they suffer defeat against Sunderland this weekend. When questioned about the turmoil at Old Trafford, Johnson maintained that the problems stem from elsewhere rather than the head coach and suggested he could envisage Sir Jim Ratcliffe and Ineos maintaining their support for the Portuguese manager.",
      "\"I can see Amorim sticking it out at United purely because the club might think they have to stand by a manager at some point,\" he told 10bet. \"They've been through so many different names already, maybe they will decide that always chopping and changing isn't the answer.",
      "\"With the squad they've got, the players just aren't good enough to be challenging the top sides. That's why Manchester United are where they are, not because of the manager.",
      "\"They're getting beaten because the squad isn't good enough. The United of old is long gone.",

      "\"There's a lot that needs fixing. If they sack Amorim, they have a new manager who inherits the same squad. Then what?\"",
      "When pressed on who he could see taking over from Amorim should he depart, Johnson declined to suggest a replacement. Instead, he maintained that any incoming boss would face an uphill battle at United in their current state.",
      "\"You can't build consistency if you have no foundation,\" he explained. \"It's a top club, they're a huge name.",
      "\"For years they were the best, and now they can't defend a straight, 50-yard pass. It's crazy to see. They need to get back to the basics. Not of the Premier League, but of schoolboy football.",

      "\"You know, it's bad, the situation. But I'm not going to try to be the defending…the judge of the coaches, or the lawyer of the coaches. But Manchester United is confirmed - after Ruben Amorim, it is confirmed that the problem is not the coaches.",
      "\"I'm sorry. Okay, I know it sounds too defensive from the coaches. But when you have six, seven, eight, forget it. Because you have all the characteristics of coaches.\"",
      "Elsewhere, Poyet also urged United fans to stop comparing the current Red Devils set-up to the one under Ferguson, who achieved 13 Premier League titles, 19 domestic cups and a pair of Champions Leagues with United during his legendary 27-year reign.",
      "He added: \"And one of the biggest things I would say to people in England is stop comparing Man Utd with Alex Ferguson's Man Utd. It's gone, it's finished, it's over.",
      "\"That was a great time for them. They enjoyed [it], they had an unbelievable club, an unbelievable coach. Finished, see you later. You cannot be the same forever. You cannot, it's impossible. Because things change. And they try with the coaches and it's not working with the coaches.",
      "\"So they need to go a little bit deeper maybe. Because I have to be realistic and say that it doesn't matter who you take now. It doesn't matter. That is not the solution, okay.",
      "\"They can do a little bit better, yeah, but the situation here is not to do a little bit better. It's unfortunately changing systems, changing players, mentality, you know, it doesn't work.\"",
      "It comes as a wealth of names have been linked with taking up management atUnited should Amorim find himself dismissed in the near future. Crystal Palace boss Oliver Glasner and Brighton's Fabian Hurzeler have seen their names thrown into the mix, as have ex-England manager Gareth Southgate, and La Liga legends Zinedine Zidane and Xavi Hernandez.",
      "For now, however, it appears as though the United board are sticking by the Portuguese tactician, who has testing games with the likes of an in-form Sunderland, Premier League champions Liverpool, Brighton and Tottenham on the horizon.",

      "Former Manchester United midfielder Owen Hargreaves has called on Ruben Amorim to shake things up to get the best from captain Bruno Fernandes. The Red Devils spent big during the summer transfer window to strengthen their attack after managing a measly 44 goals in the Premier League last season.",
      "United snapped up forwards Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo before landing striker Benjamin Sesko from RB Leipzig. However, their summer spending spree has seen Fernandes pushed into a deeper role on the field this campaign.",
      "The Portuguese star is widely considered United's finest acquisition during a barren spell since Sir Alex Ferguson stepped down in 2013. Yet he has struggled to make his mark in 2024/25 whilst operating in a more withdrawn midfield role under Amorim.",
      "The Red Devils have experimented with various combinations of Manuel Ugarte, Casemiro and Kobbie Mainoo alongside Fernandes, but the setup hasn't clicked. Hargreaves has voiced worries about how United's captain is being utilised during what has been a testing season at Old Trafford, with the club languishing in 14th place in the Premier League standings.",
      "\"But now Bruno has to play deeper to get on the ball and create. He's not playing his natural position, he's playing deeper.",
      "\"He's playing as a box-to-box midfielder. Bruno's one of the best creators in the division. So you've got to play him in his natural position.",
      "\"But because they play two 10s, you could argue Man Utd's two best players last season were Amad and Bruno. They were the two 10s, and then they went and signed two more 10s in Cunha and Mbeumo when you didn't have a keeper or a striker.\"",
      "Hargreaves has also called on Amorim to think about dropping Sesko and making a minor adjustment to get Fernandes into more attacking positions.",
      "\"I'd love to see Bruno play as a 10, maybe with Mbeumo as a No. 9,\" he continued. 'If you have Cunha and Bruno playing as two 10s plus Mbeumo, that's good.",
      "\"Maybe play Amad as a wing-back on the left if you want to stay with the formation. I just think it's harsh on Bruno, him being criticised. I can't imagine where they'd be without him. I said that to him last year, towards the end of the season before the Europa League final.",
      "\"What he's been able to produce in terms of consistency for them, that's what you need from everybody.\"",

      "Gareth Southgate would demand time and patience from Manchester United if he was to succeed Ruben Amorim. The former England manager is reportedly debating whether to throw his hat in the ring for the managerial position with the Red Devils should Amorim be sacked.",
      "However, it is suggested that Southgate would hold reservations about taking up tenure with the club and would demand four years to turn the tide at Old Trafford, which the board may not be willing to give him. As per the Sun, sources suggest that the boyhood United fan would need assurance that the top brass would stick to any long-term goals planned.",
      "The publication also claims that Southgate harbours concerns that the board would demand instant success from him, while he takes an approach centred around gradual success over a prolonged period. The 55-year-old has been out of work since stepping down as England manager last summer, after guiding the Three Lions to a runners-up place at Euro 2024 - losing 2-1 to Spain in the final.",
      "Southgate isn't the only manager who has been linked with succeeding Amorim. Palace boss Oliver Glasner and Brighton's Fabian Hurzeler have been rumoured as favourites to make the move to Old Trafford in the event of Amorim's departure, while the Real Madrid legend Zinedine Zidane and Barcelona icon Xavi Hernandez have also seen their names tossed into the mix.",
      "That's despite United ultimately showing no signs of parting ways with Amorim just yet, as he approaches his first full year at the helm. The Portuguese tactician took over the club after the sacking of Erik ten Hag last October, but could only manage a lacklustre 15th-place finish in the Premier League for the season.",
      "While Amorim was ultimately forgiven for a dismal showing, given he worked largely with the squad he inherited from the Dutchman, the 40-year-old will not be afforded the same excuses this time out. That's because the Red Devils board provided him with substantial backing this summer to make improvements to suit his patented 3-5-3 style of play, as well as a full pre-season tour to fine-tune his squad.",

      "It appears as though nothing has worked yet thus far, however, with United currently languishing at 14th in the Premier League standings after six matches, with just two wins and one draw to show for their efforts. And with an in-form Sunderland to play on Saturday, October 4, as well as games with the likes of Liverpool, Brighton and Tottenham on the horizon, the outlook could be far worse for the head coach in the coming weeks.",
      "Southgate hasn't managed in the Premier League since Middlesbrough were relegated from the English top flight in 2009. Instead, he turned his attention to international management with England in 2013, first taking the reins of the U21 side before promotion to the first-team three years later.",
      "While he failed to win a major trophy with the Three Lions, he successfully guided them to runner-up places at Euro 2020 and Euro 2024, as well as a third-place finish in the UEFA Nations League in 2018/19.",

      "Manchester United have endured a difficult start to the season. The club’s 3-1 defeat to Brentford last weekend was the latest sign that the Red Devils are yet to click under manager Ruben Amorim.",
      "The team’s loss to Brentford was a stinging result ahead of another crucial test against Sunderland at Old Trafford this weekend. Without European football to contend with, Amorim’s side have plenty of time to rest up, but watching the action from afar only serves as another reminder of the club’s failures.",
      "United’s consistently faltering league form, combined with their shock cup exit to Grimsby, has piled pressure on Amorim. The former Sporting Lisbon manager has been at Old Trafford for less than a year, but United are being linked with possible replacements.",
      "Meanwhile, the Champions League provided United with a fresh regret, as Rasmus Hojlund starred for Napoli. The United loanee had a tough couple of seasons at Old Trafford but has been likened to one of the Premier League ’s best strikers, just months after leaving the club.",
      "Crystal Palace boss Oliver Glasner has been linked with replacing Amorim at Old Trafford and the Red Devils could benefit from the Austrian coach’s contract situation. Glasner led Palace to FA Cup glory, the club’s first-ever major trophy, and his side are currently third in the table, but his contract is due to expire at the end of the season.",
      "BBC Sport reports that Glasner was offered an extension in the summer but preferred to see how the transfer window unfolded before putting pen to paper. Palace endured a frustrating summer, selling Eberechi Eze and almost losing Marc Guehi.",
      "The chances of Glasner staying with Palace beyond this season are described as “remote”. This could open the door for United to eventually make a move, given that he also favours a similar formation to Amorim.",
      "Players thriving once they leave United has become an ongoing theme, but few people would have predicted that Hojlund would earn comparisons to Manchester City ’s Erling Haaland. The 22-year-old United loanee scored twice in Napoli’s 2-1 win over Sporting on Wednesday, with both goals being assisted by Kevin De Bruyne, who compared the Dane to his former teammate.",
      "\"I think Rasmus has a lot of quality, I think he's quite similar to Haaland in terms of player type, both are left-footed and like to attack space,” De Bruyne said in a post-match interview. “It was a great night for him and I think he'll help us score a lot of goals from now on.”",
      "Hojlund’s calm finish for his first goal and winning header was a stark contrast to his performances for United and served as a reality check that players are struggling to fulfil their potential at the club. It is telling that Hojlund is thriving in the same team as last season’s Serie A MVP and former United midfielder Scott McTominay.",
      "Before completing his loan move to Napoli, Hojlund wanted to fight for his place at United this season. However, the arrival of Benjamin Sesko at Old Trafford subsequently led Hojlund to join Antonio Conte ’s side.",
      "While it may have been unexpected, the move has already proven to be the right decision for Hojlund. He has three goals in seven games and looks set to easily eclipse the 10 he scored in 52 appearances for United last season.",
      "Given his initial determination to stick with United, Hojlund did not expect to score a Champions League brace this season, highlighting his twist of fate in a social media post. “‘Højlund scores twice in the Champions League after two assists from Kevin de Bruyne’ was not on my 2025 bingo card,” he wrote on Instagram.",

      "Manchester United icon Michael Carrick has secured an unexpected new position with UEFA, whilst speculation continues to swirl around Ruben Amorim's future at Old Trafford. The 44-year-old former Middlesbrough chief has been touted for a shock comeback to the Theatre of Dreams as caretaker boss, should United's top brass decide to axe the Portuguese tactician.",
      "It's a position he's familiar with, having previously stepped up as interim manager after Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's exit from the club. Carrick's debut match in the hot seat was a triumph against Villarreal in the Champions League, and he also secured a thrilling 3-2 victory over Arsenal in the Premier League.",
      "He resigned from his role as first-team coach when Ralf Rangnick arrived at Old Trafford, having chalked up two victories and one stalemate during his temporary stint at the helm.",
      "Carrick took charge at Boro in October 2022 and steered them to the Championship play-off semi-final at the conclusion of that campaign, where they fell to Coventry City.",
      "Despite that outstanding inaugural season, the United hero couldn't replicate the success and departed the Riverside in June this year following a 10th-place finish.",
      "Now, a few short months later, Carrick has been named as a UEFA Technical Observer and recently offered his analysis on PSG's latest 2-1 triumph over Barcelona.",
      "Speaking on the UEFA website about the game, Carrick said: \"It sounds very basic but the key to the game is one-twos, third-man runs and forward runs behind.",
      "\"There was so much focus on pressing forward and relying on regaining it in that direction. But as we saw, the downside of this is there is a lot of space behind and across the back line.",
      "\"It's great if you win the ball back or if the other team keep passing to feet and trying to keep possession but it leaves you exposed against a team that is happy to run and pass less. It's runs in behind that were rewarded.\"",
      "Man United have reportedly drawn up a three-man shortlist to replace Amorim, if they do part ways with the Portuguese head coach, with Andoni Iraola, Oliver Glasner and Gareth Southgate said to be on that list.",
      "Speaking to the The Athletic in 2023, Solskjaer backed his former coach to be the manager at Old Trafford one day.",
      "\"I am 100% sure that Michael will be the manager of Manchester United if he wants to be,\" he said.",
      "\"I cannot see him not being the Manchester United manager. He's a winner, a massive winner, yet he stays in control of his emotions.",
      "\"He knows what he wants and doesn't lose his rag. He'll never be emotional and fight with the players.\"",

It is something about the way we do the same thing. We need to do the same thing, in the same way, every way, and we are not doing it the same every day. Some of you guys have a different opinion, but that's ok.\"",
      "It is not the time to say, it is time to show. I can look at the games this season, for me they are completely different, there are some things the same, some different. There are other things we cannot change. In the other games we are not the same team in some details. I have nothing to say in this moment. My job is to prepare the team.\"",
      "\"It’s normal, we cannot run away from the results. And then you have the baggage from last season. Last season doesn't matter to me, in relation to the system we have already spoke about that. We had six games this season and we have lost three. And if we lost against Arsenal because of the system? It’s your job to make the opinions. When you saw the game against City, was the first think that you thought when the game started was the system? I don't think you thought about the system in that moment. And Brentford. The way we concede goals, create chances, that is nothing to do with the system, that is my opinion. I'm not saying this team will do better in a different system, that's not my point. My point is if I look at the games we didn't win, the most important thing when I watched the game is not we lost because of the system. That is my opinion, then people have different opinions and that's ok.\"",
      "\"We already talk about that, if you see during the six games during this season we are not always the same team in small things. More in the way we play. All the effort that we put, the maximum effort into every single thing. I think it's not the same in different matches. We have to find that balance - it will change everything for us.\"",
      "\"It’s not just the table and the results, which are in the end what matter most, but it’s the way they play. They have a clear identity, they have a very good manager and they are a good team.\"",
      "\"It’s going to be a really tough match, they are doing really well. When you see their games, they draw with one less player in the final of the game. They draw a point and then win in the final play against Brentford. I think the details are changing a lot the table, so we need to pay attention to that. So it’s a team that plays really well, with a clear system, 4-3-3 with a lot of rotations on the side of the pitch. They will be confident and know we are under pressure. We need to be prepared for that. It will be a tough match.\"",
      "\"Crazy world that we are living in at the moment. A lot of these things are happening. Of course, our sympathy for the victims. And we will pay tribute tomorrow. It’s a crazy world in this moment.\"",

      "Interest in Malacia was thin on the ground, and a proposed move to Elche collapsed on transfer deadline day. Malacia was included in United's registered squad with the Premier League, and Ruben Amorim said: \"He is returning with contact with the ball with the Under-21s, then we will see.\"",

      "Speaking after the game, Kevin De Bruyne compared Hojlund to Erling Haaland, which begs the question: why do players improve significantly when they leave Manchester United?",
      "Scott McTominay has been a revelation at Napoli. McTominay opened up on life in Naples during an interview this year, and he's clearly a fan of the food on offer. \"Oh my goodness, the tomatoes. Bellissimo,\" he said. \"I never ate them at home, they are just red water. Here, they actually taste like tomatoes. It is all so fresh. It’s incredible.\"",

      "The report claims that United have not lined up candidates to replace Amorim as they did when Erik ten Hag was under scrutiny. Sacking the 40-year-old would reportedly cost the club £12million in compensation.",
      "Fletcher, meanwhile, was appointed as the Reds' Under-18s boss in the summer. His two sons, Tyler and Jack, have been promoted to the U-21s.",
      "He is reported to have made a strong impression behind the scenes at Carrington, instilling his United DNA in the young squad.",

      "They also appear to be friends despite never playing alongside or against each other during their careers, with Palmer cracking a smile after selecting Morrison.",
      "Both follow one another on social media, and Morrison even posted about Palmer receiving his first England call-up back in November 2023.",

      "\"Really disappointed because all week we were speaking about keeping the momentum going, getting another win under our belt and yeah, if you lose this game, it's a big blow, obviously,\" he said.",
      "\"Not a nice feeling, obviously. Everybody is really disappointed. I think first of all they are disappointed with themselves. The first thing you have to control is yourself. And if you can do that, you are first disappointed with yourself, and then also with the team and the whole result, so really disappointed.\"",
      "When asked about what went wrong against Brentford, he responded: \"We were short in key moments where we made the wrong decisions. That makes a big difference in football.",
      "\"I think obviously we were quite unlucky also with some chances, but yeah, overall it was not good enough. That's a fact. Then you know, against a team like Brentford who play on the transition, with long throw-ins and corner kicks, then it's going to be really difficult.\"",
      "Speaking about the players taking responsibility, De Ligt said: \"I mean it's always easy to look to the manager, but in the end, the players on the pitch have to do it. We can't say the goals we conceded, or the chances we conceded, are because of what... I don't know, you guys always talk about the system.",

      "Bruno Fernandes failed to track Emile Smith Rowe's run into the box for Fulham's equaliser, and he committed the same error against Manchester City when he lost Phil Foden in the Manchester derby. Harry Maguire unsuccessfully tried to play the offside trap for Brentford's opening goal last weekend.",
      "The fingers have been pointed at Amorim after an incredibly disappointing start to the season. There may be doubts over Amorim's system and his team selection, but the individual mistakes must stop.",

      "After a slow start to life in the Catalan region, Rashford has now scored twice and provided five assists in his last six appearances for Hansi Flick's side.",
      "Reflecting on Rashford's start to life at Barcelona, Lineker admitted it has been \"encouraging\" to see him starting matches for his new club. He told the Rest Is Football podcast: \"I think Marcus has started well at Barcelona. He's getting a lot of football. People were saying, 'he's not going to get a game, he's–.'",
      "\"Obviously you're always going to get little knocks and injuries to certain players, and he seems to be rotating quite a lot, but Marcus has started a lot of games in the Champions League. Of the three goals that Barcelona have scored, he scored two of them and assisted the other one– really good pass.",
      "\"Good start, I think it’s encouraging. You can see they really like him.",
      "\"Even at the weekend– I mean his assist at the weekend was in the league, it was a corner, but all the players ran to him. It’s a really good sign. You need that. I’m pleased.\"",
      "As for Hojlund, he scored a brace for Napoli during their 2-1 win against Sporting CP. The Dane scored his first after getting on the end of a splendid pass from Kevin De Bruyne before tucking past the goalkeeper.",
      "De Bruyne then grabbed yet another assist as his cross was headed home by Hojlund for his second of the game, capping off a successful night for Antonio Conte's side.",
      "Hojlund has found the net three times in five appearances for Napoli since his move from United, with his other goal coming on his debut against Fiorentina.",

      "Both Rashford and Hojlund left United on loan in the summer, with Antony and Jadon Sancho among the others to quit the Reds after Ruben Amorim made it clear they were not in his plans.",

That was United's fourth defeat of the season already with the upcoming fixture against Sunderland now very important to relieve pressure on his job.",
      "Despite being beaten 3-1 at the Gtech Community Stadium, MEN Sport reported earlier this week that Amorim retains the backing of United's hierarchy with no replacement being lined-up.",
      "There was at the very least one positive from Saturday with Benjamin Sesko on target. He has joined fellow summer signing Bryan Mbeumo in scoring his first goal for the club, but Matheus Cunha is still yet to find the back of the net.",
      "That attacking trio replaced the likes of Rasmus Hojlund, Marcus Rashford, Alejandro Garnacho, Jadon Sancho and Antony in the United squad. Those five players were all deemed surplus to requirements by Amorim but some already look to be proving that decision wrong.",
      "Since re-joining Real Betis, Antony has picked up a goal and assist while Sancho has looked bright in cameos for Aston Villa. However, it is the impact of the remaining three in Champions League action that has spoken volumes all while United are preparing for their next game.",
      "Garnacho was pivotal to Chelsea's winning goal against Benfica on Tuesday with his cross turned into his own net by Richard Rios. The Argentine has since posted an Instagram story captioned: \"Champions League nights.\"",
      "24 hours later, Rashford assisted Ferran Torres' goal for Barcelona against Paris Saint-Germain with a perfectly-weighted pass. The European champions ultimately won the game, but Rashford was a livewire throughout with another clear message sent to Amorim as that is the 27-year-old's sixth goal contribution since moving",
      "Hojlund also sent an unexpectedly cheeky message after a clinical finish with his weaker right foot and a brave headed goal in Napoli's 2-1 win over Sporting CP with former Manchester City star Kevin De Bruyne the supplier for both.",
      "When celebrating the first goal, the Denmark international pointed to the Champions League badge on his Napoli shirt.",

After finishing 15th in 2024/25, United currently sit 14th in the division this term, with just two wins from six matches.",
      "With that said, we round-up some of the latest news surrounding the former Sporting CP boss' future.",

Perhaps crucially, Southgate is close friends with Dan Ashworth, whose long-term plan was to appoint Southgate during his time at United before departing after five months.",
      "\"One or two matches, you get flashes. They [United] played quite well against Arsenal on the opening day, but still lost.",
      "\"I've never seen a manager go about their business the way that Ruben Amorim is at the moment. It's a well-trodden path about his system and the fact that it maybe doesn't suit a lot of the players.",

      "\"So let's wait. Let's see what happens. But for sure, the next games will be important for Ruben Amorim.\"",
      "Amorim may have one more month to convince United chiefs he is worth persisting with. It was previously reported that United may delay any sacking of Amorim until he reaches a year of service due to the substantial compensation package he would receive.",
      "As per the Daily Mail, United would need to pay up a hefty £12m bill if they sack the 40-year-old before he reaches 12 months in the hotseat.",

      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe might be keen to view this campaign as Amorim's first at the club, but the disaster that was the 2024/25 season simply cannot be forgotten.",
      "The league campaign was nothing more than an inconvenience in the final months of the season. It was Europa League or bust and United produced a performance befitting their season in Bilbao as they surrendered to perennial nearly-men Tottenham.",
      "Had Amorim arrived in the summer, a new man full of new ideas with a winning reputation, the flurry of big-money moves and uplifting pre-season campaign would have been the perfect platform from which to launch the Amorim era.",
      "As it is, the United boss' methods will forever be synonymous with the worst United team in 51 years. Trying to convince a group of players that the system that led them to their worst season in half a century is the one that will bring the glory days back to Old Trafford is a tall order.",
      "It may well be that Amorim turns the ship around, but the United boss needs to starting picking up points and he needs to do it fast.",
      "Ratcliffe may want to forget about last season, but it's not that simple.",

      "Following an interception high up the pitch from Lamine Yamal and a quick counter, Rashford delivered a precise pass across the box, allowing Fermin Lopez to slot the ball into the bottom left corner. It was his fifth assist in nine games for the Spanish giants, having also scored twice along the way.",

The morale-boosting victory over Enzo Maresca's team was undone by Brentford, as they fell to a 3-1 defeat.",
      "\"Tough decisions and rumours are always part of this job so you have to accept it, you have to deal with it,\" Hurzeler said this week. \"But I really want to say that I have a lot of respect for Ruben Amorim so I won't talk about his job or any rumours that might come regarding him.",
      "\"I'm really privileged to be a coach for Brighton and Hove Albion, I'm very happy here and we still have a lot of work to do.\"",
      "With that said, MEN Sport has taken a closer look at the latest headlines as Amorim’s future continues to spark debate.",
      "Former England manager Gareth Southgate would reportedly turn down the opportunity to coach United, if Amorim was to be dismissed. Southgate is believed to not be in rush to return to football, but he is keeping his options open, reportedly within and beyond the sport.",
      "In March 2024, he emerged as a top candidate for the United job when Erik ten Hag's position was under threat, but he declined all approaches. Since leaving his role with England, Southgate has not returned to football, instead focusing on public speaking and motivational work. He has also taken on a role hosting a show for the BBC.",
      "Additionally, talkSPORT reported that Southgate had emerged as one of three names on United's shortlist to potentially replace Amorim. But Fabrizio Romano has since dismissed those claims.",
      "MEN Sport says: While Amorim is thought to still have United’s backing, drawing up a list of potential replacements is not a bad idea if results fail to improve. It allows the club to plan ahead and be prepared.",
      "However, going behind the Portuguese manager's back to contact other candidates could seriously undermine Amorim at a particularly tough time for the United boss.",
      "United are targeting Brighton midfielder Carlos Baleba regardless of Amorim's future, according to TEAMtalk. United tried to sign Baleba late in the summer transfer window but were unable to reach a deal due to Brighton's high asking price.",
      "The Seagulls reportedly sought a fee similar to the £115million they received for Moises Caicedo in 2023. While Amorim is believed to be a big admirer, the report claims United are still set to pursue a move for the 21-year-old, regardless of whether the manager remains in charge.",
      "It is also claimed they could make a formal approach for his services next year. Liverpool are reportedly tracking the youngster as well.",
      "MEN Sport says: Regardless of whether Amorim remains in charge of the club next season, United should still pursue Baleba, as he represents a long-term investment for the squad. His talent, versatility, and potential for growth make him a player who could influence the team for years to come - and United need more of that.",

    "body": [
      "Casemiro made a beeline for Ruud van Nistelrooy in the Old Trafford tunnel on his return with Leicester City in February.",
      "Van Nistelrooy, a fluent Spanish speaker, was the conduit between Casemiro and Erik ten Hag after his Portuguese-speaking assistant Mitchell van der Gaag left. Van Nistelrooy started Casemiro in all four of his matches as caretaker manager. Casemiro lingered as Van Nistelrooy spoke, as attached to him as a comfort blanket.",
      "At that time, Casemiro had not started for United in 39 days. He did not get a kick between December 30, the night of the Newcastle United debacle, and January 30. He emerged on 70 minutes in Bucharest with United 2-0 up. The transfer window was still open but the chances of United shifting Casemiro were, like the Trinity test igniting the atmosphere, near zero.",
      "People at United's Carrington training complex noticed Casemiro's personality never wavered during a trying first half of the season. They have always found him to be a warm presence.",
      "His transformation at United in the past two months has been as unexpected as their 3-0 triumph in Bilbao. This is the midfielder who was dropped for last year's FA Cup final and replaced by Toby Collyer with United 2-0 down to Liverpool at half-time eight months ago. Casemiro’s declaration that he was keen to see out his contract in March was framed as more bad news for the club.",
      "Casemiro used his head before Athletic lost theirs in San Mames. Returning to Spain emboldens Casemiro. In San Sebastián and Bilbao, he has reminded Spanish audiences he can still cut it nearly three years on from leaving their shores. United supporters serenaded Casemiro on Thursday night.",
      "The draw with Real Sociedad in mid-March has marked a late turning point in Casemiro's third season in Manchester. With Manuel Ugarte out injured, Ruben Amorim had little choice but to turn to the older defensive midfielder.",
      "Casemiro has since been a fixture in the United starting XI, his importance highlighted by the early withdrawal at Bournemouth last week to preserve him for Bilbao. Ugarte admitted this week he is copying him.",
      "Within a matter of months, Casemiro has gone from unsellable to undroppable. If or when United reach the Europa League final, Casemiro is a shoo-in in midfield. The 3-4-2-1 system Amorim swears by has closed the yawning gaps that developed between the defence and midfield under Ten Hag and Casemiro has the safety net of a third centre back.",
      "United have adjusted Casemiro’s running and pressing triggers. “I think he has improved a lot also,” Amorim opined. “You can see not the way he plays but the way he runs. You can see it, we have the data to show him where he worked really hard.",
      "“He is a very good example. Even Toby sometimes was playing in front of him and [that] it is hard to take for Casemiro. So it is a lesson for all the players in Manchester United.",
      "“No matter what is the past or the last month, everything can change in one moment. Then we understood that he cannot jump all the time pressing high. We need to let him understand and sometimes it is better to put three defenders and let him be the fourth defender and put the wing-backs pressing high. These are all things we are understanding and trying to cope with all the criticisms of the team. But the credit is for Casemiro.”",
      "Amorim has been impressed by how hard Casemiro has worked to meet his demands to regain his place in the team. He noticed that he never complained during those winter weeks warming the bench.",
      "Selflessness is a natural trait of Casemiro's. It was also his undoing this time last year. With United depleted at centre half, he dropped back and was humiliated in the 4-0 drubbing by Crystal Palace.",
      "With Kobbie Mainoo and Christian Eriksen a flimsy shield and Jonny Evans his creaking partner, Casemiro abandoned his position to engage Michael Olise, overcommitted, lost his balance and Olise scored. Six days later, he trundled out of the United third and played Arsenal winger Gabriel Martinelli onside to square for Leandro Trossard’s tap-in. Sofyan Amrabat was ushered back in from the cold and played his way into the FA Cup final XI.",
      "Jamie Carragher urged Casemiro to “leave the football before the football leaves you”. Casemiro had been pencilled in to flank Amorim for pre-match press duties against Athletic and he would be a worthy choice at Carrington next week. He is a positive story again and one of the squad’s figureheads. United view Casemiro as a quiet leader, mind.",
      "The 33-year-old shared Raphael Varane’s view that a “disconnect” had developed between the players and Ten Hag. It is not a coincidence that Casemiro scored two goals in the first game after Ten Hag was finally sacked. He was committed enough to claim the last goal of the Ten Hag era at West Ham.",
      "When Casemiro discussed the possibility of joining United, he wanted to know three things: where he would live, where he would train and where the stadium was. During FaceTime conversations, he requested to see the club’s gymnasium at Carrington.",
      "United sources have been struck by how leaner Casemiro is this season. People in Madrid said Casemiro used to be in the club's Valdebebas gym at 8am and he often has gym sessions before and after training at Carrington.",
      "Casemiro has struck up a close rapport with some of the masseurs and his English is now a very good level of conversational. He understood our questions in the mixed zone two years ago, when his handshake grip was as tight as a vice. Casemiro's wife, Anna, and children Sara and Caio, are happy in Manchester amid the prospect of a fourth year in England's north west.",
      "Staff at Carrington regard Casemiro as one of the most respectful players they have encountered and that he is strident in protecting the club's image. Sir Jim Ratcliffe dubbed Casemiro as \"overpaid\" and \"not good enough\" in March. Three days later, Casemiro trumped his first-leg performance against Sociedad in the 4-1 win at Old Trafford.",
      "His steep decline over 18 months - dropped for Amrabat, substituted for Collyer, omitted from the Brazil squad - makes Casemiro’s revival so singular. If United win the Europa League it would be churlish to argue someone who has won three trophies in three seasons has been an unsuccessful signing.",
      "Casemiro drove United to a successful 2022-23 season. Without him, they would not have qualified for the Champions League. Ten Hag dubbed him the “cement between the stones”, essentially the glue in the team. Casemiro was central to the Latino rebranding of the United defence that kept the most clean sheets in the Premier League.",
      "Casemiro has returned to that level of influence he wielded in his first season. In Europe, at least. The concern if United do not triumph in Bilbao again this month is Casemiro could be redundant in a campaign devoid of Champions League midweeks. His recent domestic form has been inoffensive but not stellar and United need a young and dynamic new central midfielder in the summer.",
      "The senior figures made the difference in Bilbao, though. Casemiro and Bruno Fernandes, two 30-something Portuguese speakers, are naturally close.",
      "“We've got a lot of senior players who need to step up in their moments,” Harry Maguire explained. “I think Case was brilliant tonight. Bruno as well. So we have senior players who need to handle these moments really well.”",
      "Van Nistelrooy, a champion of Casemiro’s, merits credit for that.",

      "According to reports, one ‘unhappy’ Manchester United star could ‘push to leave’ the Premier League giants in January amid one key ‘issue’.",
      "There was a huge overhaul at Man Utd in the summer, with the club’s focus on overhauling their attack.",
      "Last season, the Red Devils were toothless in forward areas as Joshua Zirkzee and Rasmus Hojlund struggled, so they invested around £200m to sign Benjamin Sesko, Bryan Mbeuno and Matheus Cunha.",
      "Meanwhile, Hojlund, Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho, Alejandro Garnacho and Antony moved elsewhere after being deemed surplus to requirements by head coach Ruben Amorim.",
      "Despite this, Man Utd are still struggling to attack as they are being held back by Amorim’s preferred 3-4-3 formation, which is still not working.",
      "READ: Why Amorim to Nottm Forest and Postecoglou to Man Utd in manager swap deal makes sense…",
      "There could be more changes in January as Zirkzee remains linked with an exit after he did not secure a return to Serie A in the summer.",
      "Zirkzee has fallen in the pecking order following the arrival of Sesko as he has also been a bit-part player in the first couple of months of this season.",
      "Therefore, Zirkzee, according to Football Insider‘s Pete O’Rourke, is ‘unhappy at Man Utd’ as there ‘will be an issue’ on one condition.",
      "“A lot will depend on what Zirkzee wants to do. If he’s not playing regularly under Amorim, he might push or consider a move away, particularly with the next summer’s World Cup approaching,” O’Rourke told Football Insider.",
      "“He’s only made three appearances in the Premier League this season, with only one of those as a start, and has played just 82 minutes in total.",
      "“He isn’t happy with that situation, but obviously Amorim spent heavily on attacking reinforcements in the summer with Cunha, Sesko and Mbeumo.",
      "“There’s always been interest in Zirkzee from Italy because of how well he did for Bologna before his move to Man United, so Como and Juventus are keeping tabs on his situation.",
      "“If the player isn’t playing regularly between now and January, that will be an issue for him and he could push to leave Man United.”",
      "A report from Caught Offside says Man Utd chiefs have an ‘ideal one-in-one-out scenario’ to offload Zirkzee and land a replacement.",
      "‘Man Utd could be prepared to listen to offers for Joshua Zirkzee this winter in the aim of funding a move for a replacement.",
      "‘The Red Devils could do with making some changes to their struggling squad, and Zirkzee can seemingly move on if anyone comes in with around €35-40m for him.’",
      "Former Man Utd winger Antony claims he suffered from “rudeness” from people at Old Trafford during his final days at the club.",
      "Man Utd forward Joshua Zirkzee is one of the players on Juventus’ list to replace Dusan Vlahovic in Turin, according to reports.",
      "Featuring plenty of new signings, here’s one from every Premier League club we’re predicting to be a surprise package in 2025/26.",

      "Hear us out. Ruben Amorim to Nottingham Forest and Ange Postecoglou to Manchester United in a manager swap deal actually makes sense…",
      "Over the past year, our Premier League sack race leaderboard has been dominated by Amorim and Postecoglou, who are currently first and second (or 20th and 19th?) in the standings.",
      "In Postecoglou‘s case, this is mightily impressive as he has changed clubs and arguably remains under as much scrutiny as Amorim, who is still on the brink at Man Utd.",
      "Postecoglou could and perhaps should have hammered the final nail in Amorim’s coffin at Man Utd when his Spurs side did a job on the Red Devils to win last season’s Europa League. However, it was Big Ange, whose position at Tottenham remained untenable amid their dire Premier League form, who was sacked following the match.",
      "Amorim, meanwhile, was backed with Man Utd’s £230m summer spend on signings intended to make his squad more capable of thriving in his preferred 3-4-3 formation.",
      "There was pre-season optimism at Man Utd, as there often is, but this has swiftly evaporated following a string of poor results, with even Amorim’s strongest supporters losing faith following last weekend’s damaging 3-1 loss to Brentford.",
      "READ: A full 20 reasons why Manchester United should sack Ruben Amorim",
      "In the summer, Man Utd overhauled their attack and signed a new goalkeeper, but they remain equally ineffective across the pitch, with Amorim’s go-to system not suited to this group of players or the club overall, and this won’t change.",
      "Despite this, Amorim had gone for the method of dying on his sword and has refused to change, saying before Saturday’s match against Sunderland: “I don’t think we’ve lost because of the system. That’s my opinion.”",
      "You somewhat have to admire Amorim’s bullish refusal to adapt in an attempt to save face (and boost his chances of falling on his feet elsewhere a la Vincent Kompnay), but this decision will be his undoing at Man Utd.",
      "And while Amorim’s disastrous reign has continued to descend, Postecoglou has returned to management by replacing Nuno Espirito Santo at Nottingham Forest.",
      "For Postecoglou, the attraction to Forest was clear as they are, undeservingly, in the Europa League and are striving for more under an ambitious (and batsh*t) owner.",
      "However, the decision from Forest to appoint Postecoglou was nonsensical, given that he and Nuno have polar opposite playing styles and that they are attempting to usher in this seismic change a few games into the new season rather than in the summer.",
      "Nuno also retains the support of Forest’s supporters, so Postecoglou to Forest was destined for disaster from the get-go, and it’s already falling apart, with home fans calling for his demise during the 3-2 loss against FC Midtjylland on Thursday.",
      "So Forest, like Man Utd, should soon be looking for a new manager and their search could begin as early as this month’s international break if this weekend goes awry.",
      "Then, a swap deal involving Amorim and Postecoglou obviously won’t be considered, but this would be a less daft route than Man Utd and Nottm Forest appointing their current managers in the first place.",
      "Put simply, this is because Forest, unlike Man Utd, actually has players ready-made for Amorim’s 3-4-3 system, while Postecoglou would immediately get brownie points at Old Trafford for using players in their natural positions in a 4-3-2-1 formation, which is perfect for this current Red Devils squad.",
      "I’m not saying that Amorim would excel at Nottm Forest and vice versa with Postecoglou at Man Utd, but the two managers and clubs would be better if they sanctioned this never-before-seen swap deal than they are at the moment.",
      "READ NEXT: Big Weekend: Chelsea v Liverpool, Tottenham, Postecoglou, Haaland, Kane",

      "It will come as no great surprise that after a week which has seen Liverpool cede the Premier League title to Arsenal despite retaining top spot before falling to a second defeat of the season to Galatasaray that there are four members of Arne Slot’s crisis squad included in this list of Premier League players experiencing concerning downturns in 2025/2026.",
      "Whether after a summer move or having simply failed to maintain form for the same club, these guys are all a worry.",
      "",
      "“Who doesn’t cause Konate problems right now?” Jamie Carragher asked having watched another one of the centre-back’s Liverpool performances directed by Mel Brooks, featuring the Laurel and Hardy theme. It was Victor Osimhen on Tuesday, Jean-Philippe Mateta last weekend and Joao Pedro will be champing at the bit on Saturday, assuming Slot doesn’t remove the opportunity for further farce by taking him out of the firing line.",
      "There are indeed rumours of a move to Real Madrid, and no progress on a new contract suggests he will move on a free transfer at the end of the season. But the way his head has been turned and seemingly removed entirely from his neck stands in stark contrast to Marc Guehi’s reaction to what was a transfer that actually very nearly happened.",
      "“The sun goes up, the sun comes down, life goes on,” the wonderfully sanguine Guehi said. What Slot wouldn’t give to have him over Konate right now.",
      "",
      "Very difficult for any Manchester United player who was around last season to experience a slump in form that doesn’t leave them as a boneless mess of offal on the Old Trafford turf, though human entrails may have been a more useful plug for the midfield hole than Manuel Ugarte has proved to be this term.",
      "Fortunately they spent £200m on a whole new forward line, and we could just as easily have plumped for either Matheus Cunha or Bryan Mbeumo here, who have scored a goal and claimed no assists in the Premier League in 846 minutes combined, but we must all at least concede that they are an improvement on whomever was operating in those inverted positions last season.",
      "That’s not the case with Sesko, though. He’s got one goal, and needed three bites at that before he scored against Brentford, and is doing excellent work to realise the Manchester United fear that they have replaced one inexperienced striker who crumbled under the pressure with another.",
      "Rasmus Hojlund starring for Napoli having escaped Old Trafford is one of a full 20 reasons United should sack Ruben Amorim.",
      "“He is not injured but in the tendon he has a difficulty,” Guardiola said when asked about Rodri’s absence against Burnley, before claiming he was taken off after an hour against Monaco for tactical reasons. ACL injuries are famously difficult to return from and easing him back into action is the way to go.",
      "But Nico Gonzalez replacing him on Wednesday before allowing Eric Dier a good sniff of his shin pad to concede a penalty in the dying moments, while simply a poor decision, will only add to the feeling that the £50m(?!) signing from Porto is not the Spain international’s long-term successor.",
      "Rodri should be in his prime at 29, but City’s metronome has lacked rhythm this season, and the apparent search for another No.6, just eight months after Gonzalez was recruited, which has seen Carlos Baleba, Adam Wharton and Elliot Anderson linked with a move to the Etihad, in itself raises huge questions as to whether Guardiola and the City bosses ever expect Rodri to return to his Ballon d’Or best.",
      "",
      "While we’re reticent to judge books by covers and refuse to sign up to the view that All Footballers Are Idiots, we can’t help but feel – entirely unfairly – after a start to his Liverpool career in which Kerkez doesn’t really look like he knows what he’s doing, that the 21-year-old may not be the fastest of learners.",
      "He’s the only Liverpool player to appear in all nine of their games this season, starting seven of them, and having got two goals and six assists in the Premier League for Bournemouth last season, he’s not got a sausage for the Reds, while ducking out of headers and providing nothing like the left-side solidity in defence next to Virgil van Dijk that Liverpool reaped the rewards in eight seasons of Andy Robertson.",
      "",
      "We loved watching Rogers last season, the goals and assists, but mainly because he’s not your typical No.10. He’s not renowned for delicate touches, a small turning circle or for having his head on a swivel in those tight spaces between midfield and defence.",
      "Of course, he can get on the half-turn and play defence-splitting passes, often as well as his namby-pamby counterparts in that position. But he also bullies his way through challenges, with his most memorable moments those in which he picks the ball up with no space in front of him and thinks ‘f*** it I’m just gonna run at the goal anyway’.",
      "But he always looked like a player – and he reminds of us Dele Alli in this way – that would really suffer when things aren’t quite right. The first touch is now worse than imperfect and therefore often unrecoverable, and while we’re not sure how Martin Keown expects Ezri Konsa to “lead” Rogers to improve his retention of possession, we don’t blame him for seeking answers to Rogers’ dramatic drop-off this season.",
      "He’s perhaps the strangest of the strange picks in Thomas Tuchel’s latest England squad.",
      "",
      "We all extolled the virtues of 20-goal Chris Wood, 11-assist Anthony Elanga, the creative excellence of Morgan Gibbs-White, the rise of Elliot Anderson and the eye-catching displays of fellow centre-back Murillo last term. But in our eyes – and we suspect in Nuno Espirito Santo’s – 2024/2025 was the season of Milenkovic.",
      "And we can’t imagine a defender who quite clearly bloody loves defending has ever had a more enjoyable time than while playing under a manager who values that art at least as much as he does. We therefore wonder whether he’s had a less enjoyable time than he’s enduring right now under a manager who sees defending as the scourge of football and now faces the sack just three weeks into his reign with no wins and four defeats in six games.",
      "Having been the lynchpin of a brilliantly solid Forest side for most of last season, Milenkovic now looks like the centre-back also-ran his £11m price tag always threatened he would be.",
      "In search of The Problem with league-leaders Liverpool, short of calling out scapegoat-in-chief Konate, most fingers of blame are currently pointing in Wirtz’s direction.",
      "While fellow nine-figure summer signing Alexander Isak has so far avoided rebuke having not had the benefit of pre-season and starting just three games, much like Mikel Arteta manages Netflix FC, as we’re always waiting for the next Arsenal season for them to win anything, we’re at risk of giving up on a Wirtz series which promises plenty but is yet to feature an episode in which anything really happens.",
      "",
      "“What he has given us in recent seasons is nothing short of brilliant,” John McGinn said after Watkins broke his duck and Villa’s in their 3-1 win over Fulham last weekend, hoping the goal will “shut a few people up”.",
      "“When he gets the ball you expect that he will score,” McGinn added. But we put it to the Villa captain that that’s rarely been what people have thought when Watkins gets the ball, and definitely not now.",
      "He has the air of a man who’s been linked with a big move for two seasons and is coming to terms with the fact that that will now never happen for him. We’re apparently not among the few people to have shut up.",
      "",
      "It wasn’t all that long ago that Pep Guardiola had such centre-back riches that he had to play a couple of them at full-back, maybe one in midfield and leave at least one very fine one on the bench. It was sort of a toss-up then as to who would play in those central positions, but at that point because they were all excellent. Now it feels more as though they’re much of a mediocre muchness.",
      "Dias has always been held up as the best – of a very good bunch and now a not-so-good bunch. Having rivalled Virgil van Dijk for at least a couple of seasons at the Premier League pinnacle, we’re now not convinced he would make a top ten.",
      "",
      "Nine games into last season, Salah had six goals and five assists compared to three goals and three assists this term, but the eye test grants a far greater indication of his struggles. He looks nowhere near as vital, and we mean that both in terms of his energy and his importance to the team.",
      "Slot claims the way in which opposition sides are now looking to play against Liverpool is having an effect on Salah, whom he does admit is “out of form”, but he must be wondering – as we all are – just how big an impact the departure of Trent Alexander-Arnold and the arrival of Florian Wirtz, and him favouring the other side of Liverpool’s attack, is having on the Egyptian.",

Glasner absolutely could be poached with bigger beasts surely paying attention to the work he’s done at Selhurst Park.",
      "And if that poaching comes from outside the Premier League, then it comes with the possibility of making Glasner the next Premier League managerial casualty. But still very unlikely.",

      "Essentially, Burnley have got back to this level the same way Homer Simpson got to a heavyweight title fight. And Spurs have already given them a pummelling.",
      "Victory over Sunderland was an impressive and necessary reminder that it might still be enough against teams more on their level, but Parker will still need some fairly early evidence it can also work against established Premier League teams, which makes Burnley’s start so problematic and that win over Sunderland both vital yet potentially deceptive.",

      "Wolves absolutely love a sh*tbone awful start and enforced managerial change around November. The loss of key players and a disappointingly limp finish to last season after that thrilling run of wins through March and April mean those old doubts were nagging away even before a woeful pre-season, an opening-day paddling from new-look, old-destructiveness Man City and further defeats to Bournemouth, Everton, Newcastle United and now Leeds.",

It was good, but it could have been great. They could have finished in the top five. They could have won the FA Cup. They could even have knocked out PSG in the Champions League after thar barnstorming Villa Park comeback.",
      "These annoyances are real and meaningful, and have leaked into this season. They are already out of the Carabao and took until the fifth game of the season just to score a Premier League goal that still wasn’t enough to secure a first victory of the season at 10-man Sunderland.",

Bottom because United have so clearly and determinedly nailed their colours to the Amorim mast that they might just stick with him out of pure stubbornness.",

We said at the time that the wild 10-man win over 10-man Chelsea was not a turning point; Brentford proved it.",
      "At this point, Sir Jim and his nowhere-to-be-seen pals are probably sitting tight, waiting for a year to pass just to save a few quid on his pay-off. In which case, Amorim and United have a month before both can be put out of their misery.",

Throw in the fact that when it did work at Spurs, it worked early on due to its shock-and-awe newness before everyone figured it all out. There has been no early benefit reaped at Forest. Actually the opposite is true.",

Thirteen goals conceded, six from set-pieces, is it? Stunning.",

      "Jacobs insists that is actually some of Amorim’s new summer signings who are the “most disillusioned” at Old Trafford so far this season.",
      "The journalist added: “I think, ironically, I’m told, but some of the new players in particular are the most disillusioned because the pitch that they were given tactically, in football terms, hasn’t yet matched up to the reality, so that’s quite intriguing.",

      "John Cross writes that Bellingham ‘has been sensationally left out’ of the squad and Thomas Tuchel ‘has effectively admitted’ he was ‘DROPPED’.",
      "Well he wasn’t part of the last England squad due to injury, only made his return for Real Madrid after more than two months out following surgery on September 20, and has played precisely 100 minutes of football in his four appearances since.",
      "As Tuchel pointed out in a press conference, while Bellingham “wanted to be called up” he ultimately “lacked rhythm”.",
      "But does it really need to be explained why a player who has started one game for club and country in the last 86 days not being picked to potentially face Wales in a friendly or Latvia in a World Cup qualifier isn’t a particularly ‘massive surprise’?",
      "The ‘effective admittance’ from Tuchel was his quote asking the proverbial question: “Why not bring the same group in because they set the standards?” And, of course, not mentioning Bellingham or indeed any player specifically by name in his helpful clarification as to why Bellingham has been ‘DROPPED’.",
      "‘It also comes just two days after Bellingham was named as the England fans’ Player of the Year so this must be seen as a major shock,’ Cross adds, as if an award for performances last season bears any relevance whatsoever to a decision made based entirely on circumstances in October 2025.",
      "Bellingham not being picked is notable and interesting. But it is also completely explicable and understandable if given more than a moment’s thought.",
      "",
      "Bellingham had been both ‘AXED’ and ‘DROPPED’ according to the MailOnline, who say ‘Tuchel’s cryptic comments hint it’s INTENTIONAL’, as if he might have accidentally left him off the list initially.",
      "Tuchel also ‘REFUSED Jude Bellingham’s request,’ which is one way of interpreting a elite-level professional footballer predictably wanting to play football all the time and a manager making decisions based on more things than that one-eyed desire.",
      "The Mail are no doubt thrilled by Bellingham’s omission after laying into him throughout the last international break.",
      "And Craig Hope picks up where he left off with a lengthy opinion piece again calling out Bellingham’s ‘leading man syndrome’, ‘intimidatory manner’ and ‘ego’.",
      "‘Tuchel clearly feels a change of mindset is needed if they are to prosper together,’ he writes. Either that or Bellingham’s four appearances since returning from a quite significant surgery in the summer have totalled one minute, 19 minutes, 70 minutes and ten minutes respectively, and England have more than enough good players to not feel the need to take unnecessary risks over fitness and, as Tuchel said, “rhythm”.",
      "",
      "This line from Hope brings up a point worth reiterating far and wide considering some of the coverage Mediawatch has seen of the England squad announcement:",
      "‘[Tuchel] needs to know if [Bellingham] has listened. He needs to know the reaction after he branded the 22-year-old’s on-field demeanour ‘repulsive’ in June.’",
      "A couple of points.",
      "Tuchel didn’t ‘brand’ Bellingham’s ‘on-field demeanour ‘repulsive”. He said sometimes people on the outside “cannot see the nice and well-educated and well-behaved guy that I see and the smile. If he smiles, he wins everyone but sometimes you see the rage, the hunger and the fire and it comes out in a way that can be a bit repulsive. For example, for my mother when she sits in front of the TV.”",
      "And more importantly, Tuchel also apologised unreservedly for using that word “unintentionally”, adding: “I am experienced enough and should’ve known better, I should’ve done better. I thought I had a little more credit with you guys (the media) that I do all this in my second language.”",
      "Obviously not. We would apologise but it seems like they are completely ignored by the following month.",
      "",
      "And of course Henry Winter reckons Bellingham being left out is ‘baffling’. To be fair, everything must be confusing when you view life through the prism of the first half of Peter Beardsley’s debut season for Liverpool, 1987/88.",
      "Gareth Southgate fears that Man Utd wouldn’t give him the four years he’d need to make the Red Devils contenders again, according to reports.",
      "One Liverpool supporter is particularly riled at the idea Mo Salah and Virgil van Dijk have ‘downed tools’. Maybe Arne Slot’s transition will just take time.",
      "After consecutive Premier League defeats put an early end to Chelsea’s slim title hopes, Maresca is now of course on the verge of the sack at Stamford Bridge.",
      "Will Liverpool’s ‘mini-crisis’ become an actual crisis at Chelsea? One thing’s for sure: there’s absolutely nothing mini about the latest Big Weekend.",
      "Man Utd have been accused of planning to install Gareth Southgate as their new manager while Ruben Amorim is still in charge at Old Trafford.",

      "",
      "We would be completely bored of it by now if we didn’t actually quite look forward to witnessing the level of exasperation shown by Amorim when asked by a reporter in each and every press conference or post-defeat interview whether he might consider changing his formation.",
      "He maintains, almost entirely on the basis of success at one other football club, that it’s not the system that’s the problem, and he’s not for moving.",
      "We don’t quite know why we’ve reached a point in professional football where a manager who can’t, or at least won’t, adapt is held up as some sort of misunderstood genius, but Amorim has been given a helluva lot of rope because of his stubbornness.",
      "The ‘it worked at Sporting’ argument very simply falls down on the basis of Manchester United not being Sporting, and we do wonder whether Amorim now regrets his early insistence that he would stick with 3-4-3 no matter what.",
      "While he understandably sees a move away from his principles as a respect-dwindling admission of defeat, surely the very real, actual defeats are far more damaging to his reputation.",
      "",
      "We’re as culpable as anyone for lumping formation and philosophy together. They go hand in hand – we get it. But it’s also possible for a system to not be working for a team while the wider ethos is apparent. That’s not the case here.",
      "Without saying ‘pressing’ or ‘transition’ because literally every f***er with a few magnets on a tactics board would pick those two facets of the game as key to their philosophy, can anyone tell us what Amorim’s core Manchester United principles are? You said ‘overloads’, didn’t you? Get out.",

      "After being talked down from a ledge after a 3-1 defeat to Brighton in January, when he told United bosses he was ‘prepared to resign’, reports continue to suggest Amorim may walk before he’s pushed. And while that sounds very much like a £12m compensation saving, we can see Gary Neville now with his headset on explaining why someone quitting Manchester United before they quit on him is “the lowest of the low for the football club”.",
      "",
      "Erik ten Hag kept his job because Manchester United won the FA Cup final. Sure, it was maybe the only time in the entirely of his second season at Old Trafford when performance and result came together, and it was absolute madness to hand him a new contract on the back of it, but it was a trophy, and one they claimed by beating very much the best team in England at the time in Manchester City.",
      "Amorim didn’t win a trophy and lost to the 17th best team in England, managed by a guy whose only three victories in his last 15 games in all competitions for Tottenham and now Nottingham Forest came in that final and the two semi-finals against Bodo/Glimt.",
      "",
      "Mainoo’s teammates are ‘perplexed’ at him being sidelined by Amorim, Gary Lineker is “really worried” about him being “dismissed” and “baffled” by him not starting, and so too is Owen Hargreaves, who quite rightly said he was United’s “best player by a country mile” having come off the bench in the defeat to Manchester City at the Etihad.",
      "Amorim believes he’s “helping” Mainoo, but it’s hard to see how and the academy graduate must be similarly confused as to why he’s not playing in a team performing so poorly. Just how bad do they have to be for him to be given a fair chance?",
      "He’s been told by Amorim that it’s either him or Bruno Fernandes, but we refuse to accept that Mainoo – ill-suited or not – would fail to do a better job alongside the Manchester United captain than competition winner Manuel Ugarte, and it’s not as though Fernandes himself has been in undroppable form.",
      "Not only are United terrible, but there’s no place in the team for someone deemed by many to be the future of the club. It’s not a good look.",

      "It was supposedly an obsession with Amorim’s charisma which played no small part in Ratcliffe and INEOS plumping for him as their manager, and he would probably already be out of the job if it wasn’t for that charm. It makes him a very difficult man to dislike and there’s no doubting his ability to hold the room.",
      "But if anything, he’s honest to a fault, and we can’t imagine Ratcliffe and the INEOS bosses are too enamoured with him besmirching the great name of Manchester United.",
      "Heralding this as “the worst team in Manchester United history” can’t be good for the share price.",
      "",
      "“How are you supposed to adapt to a situation when you’re changing it constantly?!” a genuinely irritated Micah Richards asked on Match of the Day, accompanied by a graphic showing the scattergun changes Amorim made in an attempt to rescue a point against Brentford, which ended with Mason Mount at left wing-back in one of the more laughable examples of his 3-4-3 obstinacy.",
      "We can just about give him a pass for a bit of substitution chaos to turn a game on its head, but what we can’t fathom is his insistence on changing at least one of his centre-backs in every single game.",
      "He’s made ten unenforced centre-back substitutions this season. Win, lose or draw, it doesn’t matter. Leny Yoro came on for Maguire on Saturday, started on the left side, forcing Matthijs de Ligt into the middle, then moved to the right when Mount came on for Luke Shaw, with Diogo Dalot moving into the back three.",
      "There’s a fair chance they didn’t know where they were supposed to be playing come the end of the game, and there’s no way the players walked off that pitch believing they’re in the hands of a measured tactician.",
      "",
      "Reports suggest sacking Amorim will cost the club £12m. For the 2024/25 season, the difference in prize money was around £2.7m per position, meaning any new manager would need to make a five-place improvement on whatever Amorim might achieve this season for his sacking to make fiscal sense. Yer da could do that.",
      "",
      "It really is amazing just what a tonic not being at Manchester United is. After finding the net on debut for Napoli, Hojlund scored two goals in the Serie A side’s 2-1 win over Sporting in the Champions League on Wednesday.",
      "The first saw him burst through two defenders and latch on to a through ball from Kevin De Bruyne before sliding the ball between the goalkeeper’s legs; the second saw him put his head where it hurts to beat the ‘keeper to a De Bruyne cross.",
      "If you wanted a brace to showcase a Proper Striker it was just about perfect and the first goal in particular is the sort of run and finish many Manchester United fans will have been expecting from Hojlund when Amorim arrived at the club. He’s got a not dissimilar profile to Viktor Gyokeres, who banged goals in for fun under Amorim in Portugal.",
      "Instead what they got was a clearly talented striker brought to Manchester United ruined by a manager who – as Benjamin Sesko is now also evidence for – doesn’t know how to get the ball to them.",
      "",
      "In Keith Andrews’ eighth game as a football manager he “out-schooled” Amorim. His tactics weren’t revolutionary – they didn’t need to be.",
      "Brentford recycled passes between their defenders while every now and again playing the ball into midfield to draw United on to them. When the United midfielders stepped out to press, Jordan Henderson or someone else played a long ball up to Igor Thiago, who then had what turned out to be the very simple task of bullying one, two or all three centre-backs to win free-kicks, create chances and score goals with the Red Devils midfield nowhere to be seen.",
      "As Alan Shearer said, Amorim is making life “easy” for Andrews and every other manager he comes up against as they know exactly how United are going to play.",
      "",
      "Glasner is currently the bookies favourite to replace Amorim and would apparently take the job “in a heartbeat”. More fool him.",
      "The Austrian makes a lot of sense, not least because of the wonderful progress he’s made at Palace, first without Michael Olise and now without Eberechi Eze, but also because he’s showing that 3-4-3 can work in the Premier League and his contract expires at the end of the season.",
      "Gareth Southgate is second favourite and we can see why he’s Sir Jim Ratcliffe’s pick, but as Jamie Carragher said, “the problem for Ruben Amorim is that every other Premier League manager would look at it and say, ‘I could do a better job than that.'”",
      "",
      "Haven’t heard this nonsense in a while, have we? And we wonder whether that’s because the football Amorim has United playing is now so far removed from the fabled Manchester United DNA that the genetics of the football club is no longer even considered as part of the ‘what’s wrong with United’ rhetoric.",
      "Ole back at the wheel, anyone?",
      "",
      "“Something has to change and you cannot change 22 players,” Amorim said after the historic defeat to League Two Grimsby, in another hint at his possible resignation, having claimed “the players spoke really loud” through their performance.",
      "But the players might argue, as we and a raft of other publications and pundits did, that Amorim rocking from side to side on the bench as his team lost the penalty shootout was a pretty deafening declaration of a more overarching defeat. It looked like the point of no return, and still does.",
      "",
      "There’s always a rock under the one at the bottom. And while there’s undoubtedly some recency bias involved, with the latest defeat often declared a new nadir to sell a sack story or just because it’s fun to write and read about last week’s “worst Manchester United team in history” being somehow better than this week’s, there may also be a cumulative effect which automatically makes the most recent defeat the new nadir because of the sustained period of sh*te.",
      "Anyway, there have been plenty. Grimsby, Brentford, a 2-0 home defeat to Graham Potter’s West Ham, Brentford again, Wolves on Boxing Day.",
      "",
      "Amorim is an absolute gift when it comes to presenting us with images of his and Manchester United’s slow death. Aside from smiling pictures in press conferences or while walking into the stadium before the latest crushing blow, there are three stock Amorim photos available for selection: shouty, gesticulating Amorim; crouched down, head-in-hands Amorim; looking down, deep-in-thought Amorim.",
      "We love, love, love that he was asked about that last one after the Brentford defeat, dismissing it as “nothing” and “something I’ve always done”, but we will always choose to side with the body language experts drafted in to give their hot takes.",
      "“You can see him crouched down in a fetal position, almost like what a baby does,” said the Mirror’s crack BLE. “Imagine if someone was about to get beaten up, that’s the first stance they adopt. They go on the ground and put themselves in a fetal position.”",
      "",
      "You’ve got to wonder if, while watching Rashford score a brilliant brace for Barcelona against Newcastle in the Champions League, Ratcliffe and the INEOS bosses considered the possibility that they may have backed the wrong horse.",
      "Rashford would very likely still be a Manchester United player if Amorim wasn’t the manager, and is currently performing at a higher level than any of the forwards currently in the Red Devils squad, as he did at Aston Villa last season.",
      "After all of that contrived nonsense in the media about Barcelona sending him back to Old Trafford after a couple of games, he’s now asserted himself as a starter in one of the best teams in Europe, assisting a goal in each of his last four La Liga games and against PSG in the Champions League on Wednesday.",
      "",
      "“I think he’s still in a job, because I think the powers that be on Manchester United have made that many mistakes so far and decisions that they’ve made on and off the pitch that they almost don’t want to admit right now, that they’ve made another,” Jamie Carragher said on Monday Night Football.",
      "Sounds about right, but we put it to Ratcliffe and the Manchester United powers that be that by not admitting to the mistake of hiring Amorim they’re currently making another in not sacking him.",
      "There have been a helluva lot of mistakes though… Ruben Amorim is the worst of 19 Sir Jim Ratcliffe mistakes at Manchester United",
      "",
      "It was reported last month that Amorim was ‘losing the confidence of the dressing room’ as players ‘questioned his refusal to pivot mid-match, with his tactics struggling against the Premier League’s relentless pace’, and we’re not convinced that an Enzo Maresca and Robert Sanchez-inspired victory over Chelsea will have outweighed a Brentford defeat in the dressing room confidence stakes since.",
      "",
      "For Amorim, Ratcliffe, the players, the fans, the cabal of Manchester United pundits, it is really just quite embarrassing just how bad at football they are. And yes, it is also quite embarrassing to spend £200m on new players for a manager only to sack him a couple of months later, but what’s the alternative? Wade through this sh*te until January and spend another wedge of cash on the next raft of ill-advised souls doomed to fail at Old Trafford?",
      "We understand that Amorim isn’t solely to blame – there are at least five other culprits – but there really is currently no-one more to blame for this mess. He has been, and will continue to be, a “disaster”.",

      "The 40-year-old was given a lot of grace in his first few months at Man Utd as he did not receive nearly enough criticism for last season’s dire decline en route to a 15th-place finish in the Premier League.",
      "There were excuses aplenty and pleas for more time in and out of the club so Amorim could build a squad equipped to thrive in his 3-4-3 formation over a couple of transfer windows, with optimistic (or naive) supporters getting giddy in the summer as the club spent over £200m on new attackers and signed a new goalkeeper.",
      "But folks, it has been Groundhog Day once again as the Red Devils have capitulated at the earliest sign of adversity, with three Premier League losses in six games and the embarrassing Carabao Cup exit at the hands of League Two side Grimsby Town exposing their lack of progress.",
      "READ: The five people most to blame for the Manchester United mess",
      "So far, there has been zero improvement in attacking areas following their £200m overhaul, while United remain just as ineffective in the other positions after overlooking the midfield department and signing another No.2 instead of an upgrade on Andre Onana in the summer.",
      "Under Amorim, Man Utd are getting no better, as his blank refusal to adapt to save face means he is dying on his sword, and the favourite to be the next Premier League manager sacked needs to be axed soon if the club are to salvage anything from this season, with this squad of players capable of much more provided there are a few tweaks.",
      "Really, Amorim should have already been and gone, but INEOS will surely have no choice but to get rid if they lose against newly-promoted Sunderland at Old Trafford this weekend.",
      "Ahead of this game, ‘football statisticians at 247Bet’ have used a supercomputer to make predictions for the remainder of this season and for Man Utd, it makes for grim reading.",
      "According to the data, Man Utd ‘will finish the season on just 45 points’ to ‘progress to 14th place’, with this a three-point improvement on last campaign’s record low.",
      "The system also gave United ‘15% chance of relegation, a 0% chance of securing Champions League or Europa League football’, while they are ‘almost as likely to go down as 16% Sunderland’.",
      "It also says that the Red Devils should finish eight points clear of the bottom three, with Brentford, Wolves and Burnley backed to get relegated. So, there’s that at least…",
      "AI will eventually get to us all, but we at F365 have taken a hard line that supercomputers are bullsh*t and this one is the same.",
      "Still, it’s unforgivable for Man Utd, who lead our five-year net spend table, to even loosely be considered for relegation and be on a par with newly-promoted Sunderland, regardless of how well they have settled back into the Premier League, and it should leave INEOS with no option but to sack Amorim.",

      "Now, Southgate has had a break and is reportedly back on Man Utd’s radar, though a report from The Mirror claims his current ‘stance’ is that ‘he would reject an approach from Manchester United if Amorim is sacked’.",
      "‘It’s understood that Southgate is NOT in any rush to return to football. However, he is keeping his options open – both within the game and outside.",
      "‘He’s been seen at numerous matches, as well as other sporting events, in recent months, and remains close with a number of his former FA colleagues. However, Southgate is also close friends with Dan Ashworth, who had a long term plan to appoint Southgate when he worked at United.’",

      "Ruben Amorim ought to be a sack race shoo-in but Man Utd’s thriftiness and the worst start to a Forest reign in a century keeps him in Ange Postecoglou’s slipstream.",

      "For people of a certain generation, Manchester United represents the all-conquering final boss of football.",
      "The ’90s and 2000s were dominated by Sir Alex Ferguson’s team and the idea of them falling away even after the Scot left felt impossible.",
      "And yet, the club’s latest embarrassment at the hands of Brentford, a team that finished third in League One in Ferguson’s final year, was not met with shock but apathy.",
      "More than a decade on since the manager left, Manchester United have transformed from title winners to laughing stock to simply another mediocre team.",
      "But how does one of the world’s biggest football clubs fall off so severely? Here are the five people most to blame for the mess of modern-day Manchester United.",
      "£1.25billion can get you a lot of things in the world. You could buy the most expensive apartment in New York four times over. You could have 17 of the most expensive Ferraris ever made sitting on your drive. You could even own 5 million pairs of Nike running shoes.",
      "Or you could become the very public face of one of the biggest sporting embarrassments on the planet.",
      "While the Glazers keep their distance, the self-confessed United fan (even though he tried to buy Chelsea) Ratcliffe has been a permanent presence at Old Trafford since his partial takeover, meaning after every embarrassing defeat, the camera cuts to him bearing an expression of a man confused as to why this is not as simple as running a pharmaceutical company.",
      "Ratcliffe beat somewhat mysterious opposition from Qatar to become a minority owner of United but in the near 600 days that he has been in charge of football operations, it has been one negative story after another.",
      "If on-field problems are to be expected, it is off-field that Ratcliffe has come in for most criticism. Almost as soon as his feet were under the desk, Ratcliffe and chief executive Omar Berrada set about cutting down the staff size. 250 employees were made redundant in the first round, a further 200 to come, with the club suggesting it will save between £8 and £10m – or around one seventh of Benjamin Sesko.",
      "With a staff size of around 1,100, maybe United did need to trim the fat a little bit but it is the manner in which Ratcliffe has gone about it that has most rubbed people up the wrong way. Since 1985, the club had given £40,000 to a charity set up to help former players who played in an era before the millions. Ratcliffe axed it.",
      "Ruthless yes, but when he sat down with an interview with Gary Neville, the former right-back asked why the club did not arrange a one-off dinner with current players to fund the expense and Ratcliffe, while looking like Neville had just discovered the cure for cancer, said they had not considered that as an idea.",
      "Then there are the on-pitch matters. Erik ten Hag was appointed pre-Ratcliffe but it was the INEOS boss who opted to keep him after an extensive review in the summer only to sack him a few months later.",
      "United paid a not insignificant fee to bring Dan Ashworth to the club, a man who had proven success as sporting director at Newcastle, but Ratcliffe sacked him five months into the job.",
      "Ratcliffe also led the way on the hiring of Ruben Amorim, a coach who looks so out of his depth and one who appears to be pining for the sack and a nice pay-out.",
      "The club have at least repaired their training ground and plans are in place for a revamped Old Trafford but somehow the atmosphere around the club feels worse than it did when the British billionaire first stepped in.",
      "MORE ON UNITED ON F365\n👉 Man Utd flop ‘felt disrespected’ after ’40 days’ in exile after Amorim bomb squad decision\n👉 Man Utd technical team ‘bemused’ by Ratcliffe pick to replace Amorim at Old Trafford\n👉 Roy Keane, Manchester United manager? ‘Ferocious’ Red Devils legend ‘knows the standards’!",
      "In 100 years’ time and if we have not all been replaced by AI-powered cyborgs, Amorim will not even be mentioned in the history of Manchester United.",
      "His tenure, while being the main focus now, seems so fleeting, so inconsequential and so symptomatic of wider problems that it is hard to put too much blame on his shoulders.",
      "In many ways, it feels like Amorim is being blamed for the dining conditions on the Titanic. Yes, he has put the wrong cutlery out for the starters but that all seems rather inconsequential when there is a 12-foot hole in the front of the ship.",
      "Amorim has to be blamed for sticking so rigidly to a way of playing that, without some adaptations, simply cannot work in the highly physical Premier League and against some of the best tactical brains in the world. But Ratcliffe and co. should have known this before they hired him.",
      "Liverpool were the ones first on the lookout for a new manager when Jurgen Klopp retired but after looking at Amorim, their board decided he was too inflexible. Ratcliffe and co. deemed that perfect for a United squad with far worse players.",
      "Ed Woodward is not what some would call a ‘proper football man.’ Before he stepped through the doors at Old Trafford he worked as an investment banker and was working for JP Morgan before making the switch.",
      "Woodward was brought into the United fold during the Glazer takeover, acting as their advisor for the process. He was then added to a “financial planning” role but it was not until 2007 that his influence began to be felt.",
      "To give credit where credit’s due, Woodward was very good in his role of the leader of commercial operations at United. The lucrative deals he brought to the club (why wouldn’t United need an official agricultural vehicle partner?) created the platform that allows the club to spend hundreds of millions today despite being nowhere near the top of the table.",
      "But after the retirement of long-time CEO David Gill in 2013, Woodward began to play a bigger role in on-pitch matters. His first summer at the helm was characterised by an inability to bring in targets. Cesc Fabregas and Thiago Alcantara failed to join; the club even had to wait another year to sign Ander Herrera following reports that United officials met with Athletic Bilbao lawyers who were not actually anything to do with the Basque club.",
      "But more than the players the club didn’t sign, Woodward’s biggest mistakes were the ones they did. The club spent £89 million to bring Paul Pogba back to Old Trafford, giving him a £200,000 a week contract for five years.",
      "As their league placement dropped, United attempted to stay in the market for the best players by offering them inflated wage packets. They gave the 19-year-old Anthony Martial £110,000. Bastian Schweinsteiger, deemed surplus to requirements at Bayern (which should have been a hint) was on £240,000. Luke Shaw, a full-back, was on £110,000.",
      "Worst of all, it gave United a reputation for being a club that will spend over the odds. In the first season that Woodward took over, United’s annual salary bill was around £100m. By the time he left in 2022, it was £230m.",
      "The summer after Woodward left, United signed Casemiro giving him £350,000 a week. To put that in context, Virgil van Dijk earns that for being the captain of a Premier League-winning squad. Mohamed Salah and Erling Haaland are the only players in the league who earn more and all three of them signed their contracts this year, not back in 2022.",
      "United’s wage structure was blown out of the water by Woodward and trying to reel it back in while remaining competitive is proving to be an impossible task.",
      "Apportioning blame to a man who delivered 38 major trophies to a club may seem harsh but Ferguson was much more than a football manager.",
      "For more than two decades, Ferguson was Manchester United, for all the good and all the bad but his most egregious error came away from the pitch and was one born out of ego and selfishness.",
      "If football was the day job, Ferguson’s love was the racecourse. A huge horse racing fan, Ferguson became pals with John Magnier and JP McManus, the two richest men in Ireland and horse race owners. Ferguson convinced them to purchase shares in United, making them the second largest owners behind BSkyB.",
      "All was well until Ferguson was named as one of the owners of Rock of Gibraltar, a horse from the Coolmore stables owned by the Irish pair. The reasoning was good-natured enough: they wanted Ferguson to be the speaker at an event where rules dictated only owners could do so and they had a long-standing friendship with the Scot.",
      "But then, as it usually does, money turned things sour. The horse unexpectedly became rather good and was named European Horse of the Year in 2002. The friendship changed when Ferguson, as an owner, suggested he would be owed some of the stud rights (the right to breed with the horse in the hope of producing another champion) which are far more valuable than any race winnings.",
      "The Irish duo claimed Ferguson’s ownership was an honorary title and no such rights were due but the United boss did not back down and an enormous fallout occurred, eventually ending in a £2.5m out-of-court settlement for Ferguson after a long legal battle.",
      "But that money was only the second biggest effect of the affair which compelled both the Irish pair to sell their United shares to sever ties with Ferguson. And who was waiting in the wings? The Glazers.",
      "Could the Glazers have agreed a deal anyway? Maybe, but without the fallout with Ferguson, the Irish duo may not have parted with their shares and opened the door for the club to become a vehicle to line the Glazers’ pockets.",
      "Ferguson was already a rich man and had he not been greedy, the club he helped build may not have been in the mess it is now.",
      "For all the contributions of the mess of the modern-day United, the real genesis of the problem came 3,000 miles away from Old Trafford.",
      "Malcolm Glazer was a wealthy man but his finances were nowhere near the level needed to take over the most successful club in England. Instead, he financed the takeover by putting the club itself as collateral and when he took over, the near debt-free United found itself with £604m on the books.",
      "But buying United was not a passion project for the American family, who also own the NFL team the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. It was an investment. Football was well into the Premier League era and the finances were only going one way; taking control of the biggest club gave the Glazer family access to incredible wealth.",
      "They ‘earned’ this by taking dividends every year which the BBC calculated was around £1.2 billion in total. Instead of using that money to pay off the debt that they themselves put on the club, the Glazers pocketed it. The result is United have a debt now worth over £1 billion.",
      "The Glazers have also been very hands-off when it came to running the club. Ferguson and Gill papered over the cracks in the early years but when those two figureheads left, the Glazers kept a distance, using Woodward as their man to run things.",
      "They have also been incredibly stagnant when it comes to facilities. Old Trafford, once the envy of clubs across the country, is run down and susceptible to a leaking roof every time there is more than a slight downpour in Manchester. When favourite son Cristiano Ronaldo returned in 2022, he was dismayed to find the facilities were the same as when he had left.",
      "Two decades of Glazer rule has left the club a shell of what it once was. The badge on the door may still say Manchester United but underneath it, the club is entirely different from the early 2000s.",
      "The Glazers’ apathy has been the biggest killer of Manchester United, far more than any manager or executive has been. and yet, they still won’t sell because frankly why would you? Malcolm Glazer died in 2014 with his sons Avram, Joel and Bryan happy to pick up the ticket for the gravy train.",
      "In 2024, they sold 30% of their shares for a fee of £732m but their pockets have long been filled.",
      "Before the takeover was completed in 2005, the then-United board warned that taking on that level of debt would cause “a downward spiral in both team and financial performance.” In the 20 years that has followed, they have been proven right.",

      "While Manchester United eventually found homes for most members of their summer bomb squad, a buyer or even loan suitor for Tyrell Malacia could not be sourced.",
      "The Dutch defender had a difficult temporary spell at PSV in the second half of last season after quickly being ostracised by Ruben Amorim, under whom he has made just eight appearances.",
      "Malacia had been training with the U21s since being frozen out but as Amorim pledged in July, he has been brought back into the first-team fold with the transfer window shut.",
      "Even during his exile Malacia earned rave reviews for his commitment.",
      "His ‘intensity’ was described as ‘off the charts’ and his ‘attitude’ regarded as ‘an example for everybody else’, according to Chris Wheeler of the Daily Mail.",
      "It is also said that Malacia ‘requested to be allowed to play for the U21s’ during his time with them but that opportunity never transpired.",
      "Dutch outlet Voetbal International adds that while Malacia’s return to the fold was ‘against all odds’, Amorim ‘will give the left-back a serious chance to fight his way back into the team’.",
      "“We got to see him for the first time reintegrated back into the first team this morning. We got a glimpse of open training with Ruben Amorim’s squad.",
      "“Remember, this was a player who was training away from the group alongside the likes of Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho and Antony. But Ruben Amorim was always very adamant that any player who didn’t get a move away from the club would be reintegrated into the first team and that is exactly what has happened with Tyrell Malacia.",
      "“He had a meeting with Amorim, as I understand it, this week. He has been training with the U21s for the last few weeks to get some fitness back amongst the group.",
      "“It’s been described to me as he’s had an outstanding attitude in training with the U21s, he’s been a great influence on that squad, and he has now back with the first team.",
      "“This is a player who’s had a really challenging few seasons, first of all through injury. But then also just not really being involved in the first-team picture. He last represented Manchester United on January 26 in the Premier League.",
      "“But this was always part of the plan. He was part of the Premier League squad that was submitted at the beginning of the season. He’s another option for Ruben Amorim to look at at that left wing-back position in a side that is conceding somewhat soft goals.",
      "“It might be a few weeks before he gets that match fitness back, but it was good from a fan perspective to see those pictures of Tyrell Malacia, backing up what Ruben Amorim had to say in the summer.”",

      "Gary Neville has delivered his most damning verdict on Ruben Amorim's Manchester United yet as the under-pressure Portuguese coach readies for a crunch clash against Sunderland this weekend.",
      "Amorim fell to another sobering defeat as a rampant Brentford beat United 3-1 at the Gtech last weekend.",
      "It denied Amorim the chance to end a dismal record of failing to secure back-to-back league games in the same season since May 2024. United now sit in 14th, having lost three games this season, losing two and drawing one of their six fixtures, which has prompted huge concerns for Neville.",
      "\"I'm very worried,\" Neville told NBC, Sky's US partner, following the 3-1 defeat at Brentford. \"There's no point in me sitting here and saying that I'm not.",
      "\"The levels of performance, the results, the substitutions...[at Brentford], I saw something [which happened] at the end of the Grimsby game that they lost in the Carabao Cup a couple of weeks ago, which was Mason Mount ending up at left wing back.",
      "\"Now, look, we admire managers who are resilient, who are stubborn around the system. We want them to stick to the plan.",
      "\"But when you've got Mason Mount playing at left wing-back, you're going to look pretty stupid. And that's happened twice now. It can't happen. The first time I thought was unforgivable and it's happened again.",
      "\"He changes his back three and his back five every single game. And the performances and the results are just unacceptable. So I'm really, really worried.",
      "\"I would never go on television - I know how difficult a manager's job can be - and say that a manager should be sacked. But I suspect that the hierarchy at Manchester United are going to want to see a turnaround very quickly.\"",
      "Neville: \"When you've got Mason Mount playing at left wing-back, you're going to look pretty stupid.\"",
      "What the stats say: A manager's substitutions are meant to help a team, but Ruben Amorim's in-game changes at Manchester United have so far proven to be more of a hindrance. His Premier League substitutes have made more errors leading to goals than they have scored goals.",
      "That is as damning as stats come for a coach. The tally stands at 3-2 since he took charge nearly 11 months ago. In six games this season, two of Amorim's substitutes have made errors leading to a goal and none have scored off the bench.",
      "Neville: \"The results are just unacceptable.\"",
      "What the stats say: Results have been bad ever since Amorim arrived, so it is difficult to tell what it would take for the situation to become intolerable for the decision-makers at Old Trafford.",
      "Graham Potter was sacked by West Ham last weekend with a win percentage of 26.1 in the Premier League. Amorim's stands at 27.27 per cent after 33 games.",
      "For context, that is identical to Chris Wilder's record at Sheffield United in the top-flight after 66 games.",
      "Steve Bruce had a marginally better win rate when he was sacked by Newcastle, and so did Gary O'Neil at Wolves. This is the ballpark Amorim is in.",
      "Compared to coaches at 'Big Six' clubs since that moniker came into being in the early 2010s, Amorim has the worst Premier League record of those with at least 30 games. Juande Ramos was not much better at Spurs (28.6 per cent), but the 'Big Six' didn't exist then.",
      "Neville: \"He changes his back three and his back five every single game.\"",
      "What the stats say: Amorim has used 21 different back threes in his 33 Premier League games at United, which is by far and away the most of any other side in the competition during that timeframe. Southampton (13) and Wolves (10) are the closest behind.",
      "A change to the back three worked against Amorim last time out, with Harry Maguire starting in the back three for the first time in the league last season and playing a part in the first goal United conceded.",
      "Tinkering with his back line appears to be a consistent theme under Amorim. Leny Yoro, who started each of United's first four league games of the season, hasn't started since but has been introduced in the last two. Matthijs de Ligt and Luke Shaw have both started all of United's league games so far. However, Shaw has only completed 90 minutes in three of those games.",
      "The lack of consistency at the back of United has proved to be a reflection of their lack of consistency in both results and performances."

      "Manchester United forward Bryan Mbeumo admits the players \"need to take responsibility\" for their poor start to the season, which has put head coach Ruben Amorim under serious pressure.",
      "\"Obviously disappointed with the result, I had a warm welcome back from the fans and I will never forget that,\" he said.",
      "\"I think everyone in the team needs to take responsibility. When you play in a club this big, everyone needs to know what to do - as a team, we need to do better.\"",
      "Mbeumo has a unique perspective of the situation, having seen the noise outside of United and now witnessing it on the inside.",
      "The scrutiny has recently come from all directions. From former captains Wayne Rooney and Gary Neville to their away fans demanding them to 'attack, attack, attack' against Brentford in a lacklustre performance.",
      "Mbeumo said: \"Obviously it's different, it's not the same, but the only thing we want to be focused on is ourselves, we just try to listen to what's going on inside.",
      "\"It's not that hard [to block the noise out], obviously, the main thing we see is on social media, so it's just not going on there much, and you just have to stay focused on your own things.\"",
      "For all of the negativity that seems to surround Man Utd at this present time, there was a moment at the weekend that Amorim and United fans had been waiting for.",
      "That was the sight of summer signings Benjamin Sesko, Matheus Cunha and Mbeumo starting a Premier League game together for the first time.",
      "United spent over £200m on their new attacking trio, and now the focus will be on seeing how quickly they can click to catapult the team up the table.",
      "\"It's exciting, because we get to learn to play with new players and it's always challenging, but that's what we like as footballers,\" Mbeumo said.",
      "\"Of course it will improve, we haven't played a lot together, so there are certain things that we're going to improve, and there are different types of players, but it's good to be with them.\"",
      "One of Mbeumo's other team-mates is Bruno Fernandes, who has had a rollercoaster of a season himself.",
      "He scored the crucial winning penalty against Burnley but then missed spot-kicks against Fulham and Brentford - and although the United captain has often had to front up to criticism of his side, Mbeumo agreed to the idea that his team-mates may need to support their skipper in these difficult moments as well.",
      "The 26-year-old said: \"It's important to support him because this is what he's doing every time.",
      "\"I think it's normal for us to carry him as well sometimes because he gives us a lot, and it's good for him to have us as well.\"",

      "Our football betting expert and top tipster Jones Knows provides his insight across the Premier League and backs Sunderland to beat Manchester United.",
      "If you're looking to jump on a savvy angle this weekend, make sure you're on Tottenham's set-piece threat. Since Thomas Frank took the reins, Spurs have added a whole new weapon to their attacking output: their massive threat from dead balls. And against this Leeds side that wobbles like jelly when defending set-pieces, the numbers point to backing Spurs to cause Leeds lots of problems.",
      "Leeds are shipping 1.7 shots per game from set-pieces and have already allowed four goals conceded via that method, including last weekend's last equaliser for Bournemouth.",
      "Frank's teams make clever blocks, delayed runs, decoy movements, and that causes chaos in the six-yard box. Micky van de Ven has already scored three goals this season as the Dutchman has quietly become a monster at these attacking set-pieces. He is 33/1 with Sky Bet to score first.",
      "Eberechi Eze is not your typical Arsenal midfielder. He doesn't deal in safe passes, low-risk link play or rehearsed rotations. He thrives on chaos. Unpredictability is in his blood and in an Arsenal side that, at times last season, could feel a little too methodical in the final third from open play, Eze's spontaneity and eye for something different is the perfect curveball that opposition players must warn against.",
      "With the technical security around him, he's going to get more touches in dangerous areas, more one-on-one situations and this should lead to an increase in his shots on target numbers than what the algorithms are predicting. He's recorded two shots on target in both of his last two starts at Newcastle and Port Vale which points towards the 6/4 on him clearing that line again with Sky Bet being a slice of value.",
      "Those backing Manchester United at 1/2 with Sky Bet are being lured in by their expected goals for data. It's the best in the Premier League (12.21) - but that is as a misleading statistic as you're likely to find when it comes to analysing expected goals.",
      "The moment you start judging a team's attacking quality solely by their xG, you're dancing on a tactical tightrope without a safety net when it comes to making betting decisions.",
      "United's expected goals data is so healthy as the game-state has forced them to chase games after falling behind in matches, owing to their horrendous defensive process, which is the second worst in the Premier League according to expected goals against (9.35).",
      "From six Premier League games, they have spent 244 minutes trailing this season - that is why those xG figures appear so healthy.",
      "A huge chunk of that attacking data and chance creation has come when the game was out of their reach. If a team only looks dangerous when it's losing, how dangerous is it, really? That's a red flag.",
      "And, despite over a decade of chaos, churn and comedy defending, it's still a club that draws in public money like few others in the betting markets, which in turn keeps their price shorter than it should be.",
      "Sunderland to avoid defeat on the double chance at a whopping 13/8 with Sky Bet it is then.",
      "The markets have chalked up over 2.5 goals as a short-priced favourite at 1/2 with Sky Bet - as they often do in the Premier League - but peel back the layers and there's plenty of evidence to suggest a low-scoring, tight encounter is the smarter play. Under 2.5 goals is around 6/4 with Sky Bet. And that's value.",
      "Arne Slot is a pragmatic, flexible coach who wants control, not the chaotic defending we've seen at times from Liverpool this season.",
      "Slot will be aware of the noise heading into an international break about his side and this is why pure focus will be on defensive solidity, discipline and trying to control the game through possession at Stamford Bridge.",
      "Plus, still without Cole Palmer, Chelsea look predictable and blunt.",
      "I'm expecting a slow burner.",
      "Burnley's new signing, Florentino, is shaping up as a fantastic bet in the fouls committed markets, which are often overlooked as a mainstream betting medium but are laced with value especially for new signings adapting to the Premier League's physical demands.",
      "The Premier League is fast, physical and ruthless and Florentino's style screams dynamic enforcer on what we've seen from him in his two starts so far. He's a midfielder who plays with aggression and intensity, breaking up play and never shying away from a physical duel.",
      "The former Benfica man committed 1.79 fouls per 90 last season, including making at least one foul in his last 19 starts. He's already made three in two starts for Burnley and such is Villa's foul-drawing strength in central areas, that kind of average is likely to be repeated at Villa Park. The Evens for two or more Florentino fouls looks a solid play.",
      "Crystal Palace have the team to do something really special this season in the Premier League.",
      "But they won't.",
      "As to remain consistent in the Premier League will be almost impossible for them to achieve due to their European commitments.",
      "A first taste of European football in their modern era is something fans and Oliver Glasner will take very seriously. And rightly so. Selhurst Park under the lights for a knockout game will be mega. But as romantic as that sounds, it's also going to bring with it a Premier League hangover.",
      "Clubs of Palace's stature and budget often struggle to handle the double life of domestic and European football. Clubs outside the big six who get Europe have an average drop of 6.3 league positions the following season since 2015. We've seen it with Brighton, West Ham and Leicester over the years. It's going to happen to Palace, so the home win at 6/4 with Sky Bet looks a wise investment on Everton following Palace's midweek trip to Poland.",
      "In a Newcastle midfield built to fight, Sandro Tonali glides and creates the magic. While Bruno Guimaraes orchestrates and Joelinton bullies, Tonali is the biggest goal threat. Everything he does is filled with intent. He doesn't just want to circulate possession. He wants to influence.",
      "When Newcastle play at home, Eddie Howe unleashes a more expansive, front-foot midfield. Tonali becomes the spare man in transitions, the third runner in attacks and has become a goal threat. He's scored five times in his last 17 starts at St James' Park and has averaged a healthy 1.62 shots per 90 with hitting two or more shots in seven of his last 11 home starts.",
      "He's not being priced like a consistent goalscoring threat yet. And that's where the edge is at 11/2 with Sky Bet.",
      "Brighton at odds-on to beat Wolves? It just doesn't sit right. The price doesn't match the flakiness and inconsistencies involved with Fabian Hurzeler's team.",
      "Yes, Brighton are still getting results. But scratch beneath the surface with both the eye test and the underlying metrics and this is a team that isn't functioning anywhere near the levels the market seems to think they are.",
      "Brighton's defensive numbers are the biggest worry. They've conceded an average of 1.6 expected goals per game over the last 13 Premier League - that's the worst per 90 figure of any ever-present team during that period.",
      "Their pressing structure, once so cohesive and suffocating, is now easier to play through - and their high-risk, high-reward build-up play is not seeing the returns it once did. They have kept just one clean sheet in their last 18 Premier League games, too.",
      "Wolves are of course no juggernaut, but they're tactically disciplined, aggressive in duels and more than capable of spoiling Brighton's rhythm in midfield.",
      "The market is pricing up Brighton on vibes rather than reality. Back Wolves on the draw no bet at 7/4 with Sky Bet.",
      "There are few greater joys in the betting game than sniffing out value in the foul markets. It's the new frontier. Goalscorer markets are overcooked. Booking points can be a lottery. Outright markets can be settled on fine margins. But fouls? That's where the true edge lives.",
      "The standout match-up for fouls this weekend is Michael Kayode vs Jeremy Doku. Such is Doku's form right now, all I can say to Kayode is: good luck, son.",
      "Kayode is as raw as they come but very aggressive with his defending, meaning he's foul-prone when isolated.",
      "Douk doesn't just beat defenders, he destroys them. He's drawn 13 fouls in his last five starts and is completing nearly five dribbles completed per game. Kayode is 6/4 to make two or more fouls with Sky Bet. That's a lovely angle to attack.",

      "Tuesday 30 September 2025 17:00, UK",
      "PGMOL chief Howard Webb says it was \"good use of VAR\" to overturn Arsenal's 'penalty' at Newcastle and explains Nick Pope's challenge on Viktor Gyokeres was \"quite different\" to the foul committed by Chelsea's Robert Sanchez that saw him sent off a week prior.",
      "Magpies goalkeeper Pope eventually avoided conceding a penalty after he came out to challenge Gunners forward Gyokeres in the first half of Arsenal's 2-1 win at St James' Park. Running towards the ball in the Newcastle area, Pope rushed out to challenge Gyokeres, appearing to bring him down in the process.",
      "Referee Jarred Gillett initially gave a penalty for the challenge; however, VAR Darren England recommended an on-field review. After around three minutes, Gillett then announced the decision had been overturned.",
      "Bukayo Saka and Mikel Arteta were critical of the decision after the game. The pair questioned how it was deemed 'clear and obvious' to overturn the decision.",
      "REF: On-field decision is a penalty. Nick Pope, a trip by Nick Pope.",
      "VAR: OK, checking the on-field decision of penalty.",
      "VAR: Got a better angle?",
      "Replay Operator: Yeah, I've got a better angle from behind here.",
      "VAR: Does he get a touch on the ball, the goalkeeper? I think he gets a touch on the ball. Nick Pope gets a touch on the ball here.",
      "Assistant VAR: Yes, he does, yeah.",
      "VAR: Does he? One more time. He actually gets a touch on the ball, doesn't he?",
      "AVAR: Yeah, there's a secondary touch.",
      "VAR: Give me another angle, please. Just make sure that Pope touches the ball, please.",
      "Replay Operator: I've got an SSM (Super Slow Motion), but it's from the other side.",
      "VAR:  He does touch the ball, doesn't he? Touches the ball first, then there's contact afterwards. Therefore, that's not a penalty kick. He touches the ball there.",
      "Replay Operator: This is the best angle.",
      "AVAR: Have you got the behind view?",
      "Replay Operator: Yeah, this is the best angle I've got.",
      "VAR: He does, doesn't he? He touches. OK, let's just check the APP (Attacking Possession Phase) as it goes over as well.",
      "AVAR: It's definitely played by a defender. But check it anyway.",
      "VAR: Jarred, I'm going to recommend an on-field review for possible no penalty. Let me know when you've got the monitor. I am going to check APP as well. Nick Pope gets a touch on the ball.",
      "Replay Operator: I'll go slowly so you can check the APP.",
      "VAR: Yeah, yeah. It's his defender, a clear defender, isn't it? It's always clear defender, that's fine. The APP has been checked, the APP is clear as well. I'm going to show you the tight angle first with the ball being touched by Nick Pope. Any contact that happens thereafter, after the contact has been made.",
      "VAR: Nick Pope gets a touch with his right foot, I'll give you another angle on the touch.",
      "REF: Show me a better angle to see that he touches the ball.",
      "VAR: I will do, I'll show you a better angle.",
      "Replay Operator: Do you want the SSM from the other side?",
      "VAR: Yeah, yeah, yeah, super slow. Super slow, coming in now. Gets a touch on the ball there. And then just plants his foot in a normal action.",
      "REF: The attacker plays the ball first. I don't know if the goalkeeper actually plays the ball.",
      "VAR: The attacker plays the ball. Yeah, the attacker plays the ball, and the goalkeeper plays the ball then with his right foot, there.",
      "REF: Just play it at full speed, please.",
      "VAR: Any contact there, any contact after that is normal contact, because the goalkeeper just plays his foot.",
      "REF: Can you play it at full speed?",
      "VAR: Playing at normal speed for you.",
      "REF: So I'm seeing the goalkeeper get a toe to the ball first, prior to making contact.",
      "VAR: Agree.",
      "REF: So after a view, the goalkeeper plays the ball, there's no foul. Final decision, we drop ball.",
      "VAR: Confirmed.",
      "\"At full speed, it looks a penalty, doesn't it? And you can absolutely understand why the referee gave it from what he saw on the field.",
      "\"He gave it for a tripping action by Nick Pope. The VAR checks the penalty. Obviously, it's a reviewable situation, penalties, goals, etc.",
      "\"So he checks the penalty, makes sure that the decision is not clearly wrong. When he does that, he clearly sees that Gyokeres gets to the ball, pokes it a little bit forward, but then, importantly, Nick Pope also gets a very clear touch on the ball as he steps forward with that right foot and deviates the direction that the ball is going.",
      "\"And that hadn't been appreciated on the field by the referee. Pope then plants his foot on the ground. He doesn't drive it forward into Gyokeres.",
      "\"There's a gap, clearly a gap, between the two players after Pope has played the ball, and then the two players come together quite normally. The action by Pope is normal. It's not reckless. It's just a kick out towards the ball. The ball deviates.",
      "\"No contact on the player until the ball has been played away, and then the contact happens fairly normally. So, not a foul, and therefore a good use of the VAR to intervene to show the referee what really happened.",
      "\"The deviation's quite clear. You'll see that touch by Gyokeres, and you'll see Pope's right leg come in. It touches the ball, it moves the ball away in a different direction to the direction it was previously going in.",
      "\"When he then puts his foot on the ground, having made contact with the ball, there's a separation between him and Gyokeres. There's no contact at that point. The contact only happens after Pope has played the ball.",
      "\"So, it's a good challenge by Pope. It's not a foul, and there was an important part around this in that the referee didn't recognise that touch by Pope in real time.",
      "\"Hence the reason that when the VAR saw it, he deemed it to be a clear and obvious error because that touch by Pope hadn't been seen, and therefore the referee could go to the screen to look at that really important aspect and make a judgement for himself, and the judgement was: I've seen the touch, therefore it's not a foul, and I'm going to start with the drop ball.",
      "\"The referee hadn't recognised that touch, that was important, the VAR saw it and deemed it was a clear error. I agree with the VAR's intervention, so the referee can go to the screen, look at the full sequence, see that touch, see that there was a normal playing action by Pope and the penalty was rightly cancelled.\"",
      "A similar scenario happened during Manchester United's 2-1 win over Chelsea. Early on in the game, an onrushing Sanchez hacked down Bryan Mbeumo just outside the area and was subsequently sent off for denying a clear goalscoring opportunity.",
      "Webb's verdict:",
      "\"I know people have compared the two situations. I think they're really quite different, and we'll talk about why.",
      "\"I think the only similarity is that there is a touch on the ball from the goalkeeper in both situations, but the way that touch happens is quite different.",
      "\"Now, in this situation, Sanchez was sent off for denying Mbeumo an obvious goalscoring opportunity. He committed a foul, which prevented Mbeumo from continuing through to try to score.",
      "\"When you see the way that Sanchez comes out to try to play that ball, whereas we saw Pope play the ball low, his foot went straight to ground, and then there was a normal coming together.",
      "\"In this situation, he leads with a raised leg and stud showing, which goes into the leg of Mbeumo. It's at least a reckless action. Some people have talked about it, maybe even being more serious foul play, endangering the safety of the opponent.",
      "\"I think it's reckless, at least. It has to be penalised. There is that small touch on the ball, but that doesn't negate the fact you have to penalise this sort of action.",
      "\"And that touch, by the way, is quite different to the Pope one in that the ball doesn't really deviate, it just continues.",
      "\"It touches the top of the boot of Sanchez, and then continues in the same line with Mbeumo about to run onto it. In Pope's situation, we saw quite a deviation of that ball.",
      "\"So, for all of those reasons, this is absolutely something we have to penalise, primarily, though, because of the nature of the way that Sanchez went in, stood exposed on to the leg of Mbeumo.",
      "\"It has to be a foul. And then, of course, we know that the conditions are there for an obvious goalscoring opportunity.",
      "\"Mbeumo running on to that ball, the defenders are not there to cover. It's obviously a goalscoring opportunity. And therefore, the red card comes out for that reason.\"",

      "“This has to end as quickly as possible,” says Jamie Carragher of Ruben Amorim’s time at Manchester United, labelling it a disaster for both parties. United were beaten 3-1 by Brentford on Saturday as their struggles continue under the Portuguese coach",
      "Monday 29 September 2025 21:16, UK",
      "Jamie Carragher has described Ruben Amorim's time at Manchester United as a disaster for both the club and the manager, urging everyone to shake hands and move on, claiming that another coach could take this group of players into Europe.",
      "Carragher on Amorim...",
      "\"I think he is still in a job because I think the powers that be at Manchester United have made that many mistakes so far with the decisions they have made on and off the pitch that they do not want to admit right now that they have made another.",
      "\"This has been a disaster for Manchester United but also for Ruben Amorim. What he did at Sporting Lisbon was fantastic. He looked like the next big thing as a manager. But bringing a manager like that in with the system he plays I don't think ever suited a club like Manchester United with the traditions at Manchester United.",
      "\"The quicker they make the decision on the manager the better for everybody because like I said it has been a disaster for the club and the manager. We are just waiting for the inevitable, unfortunately, because you don't want people to lose their jobs. But this has to end as quickly as possible.",
      "\"I have never been a big one for saying he has to change his system. A lot of managers speak and say the system might change but my style does not. His baby is his system. It is like asking Jurgen Klopp not to press or Pep Guardiola not to play short passes through the middle of the pitch. This is what he is.",
      "\"This is on Omar Berrada or Jason Wilcox or Jim Ratcliffe. They brought him in. They knew that when they brought him in.",
      "\"The problem for Ruben Amorim is that every other Premier League manager would look at it and say, 'I could do a better job than that.'\"",
      "United brought in £200m worth of attacking talent in the summer in the form of Bryan Mbeumo, Matheus Cunha and Benjamin Sesko, but Carragher believes that the United squad could still be fashioned into a team - under a manager with a different system.",
      "\"The only positive for Manchester United is that they have not gone all in on his system,\" Carragher explained on Monday Night Football. \"They have gone all in in terms of giving him money to spend but they have not bought lots of centre-backs and lots of wing-backs.\"",
      "He continued: \"The players they have brought in could easily be flipped into a back four with Bruno Fernandes as a No 10, Mbeumo on the right wing, Cunha on the left, Sesko up front and I think a competent Manchester United manager could get that team into the European places or certainly be fighting for them.",

      "Another defeat for Manchester United, more inevitable and raucous debate about whether Ruben Amorim is the right man for the job.",
      "The noise from outside the club is growing, but within the Old Trafford halls of power, the United bosses remain steadfastly patient with the Portuguese head coach. Albeit with mounting frustration on all sides at the team's inconsistency.",
      "Amorim himself has repeated his assertion that he is not concerned about the possibility of being sacked, but he knows results have to improve significantly - and quickly - if he is to stay in the job.",
      "Despite reports to the contrary, sources are adamant the bosses are not lining up a list of replacements. The club, under its new INEOS stewardship, is determined to take a long-term view in all the decisions it takes - about player recruitment, facilities and the coaching staff - and so will not make any knee-jerk reaction to individual defeats.",
      "The trouble for Amorim is that results have been persistently poor since he took over, and the optimism-inducing win over Chelsea has been followed up with a chastening 3-1 defeat against Brentford. United have taken 34 points from his 33 games in charge, and have yet to muster back-to-back wins in his 11 months at the helm.",
      "United are not actively looking for their next manager. Nevertheless, every football club has contingency plans in place should they lose the head coach, in whatever circumstances, and it would be naive to think United will not have specific targets in mind if, for example, Amorim chose to resign.",
      "He said in August following the Carabao Cup humiliation at the hands of Grimsby Town that \"sometimes I want to quit\". But he also said at the time \"sometimes I want to stay for 20 years\".",
      "At Old Trafford and Carrington, there are no murmurings for managerial change. But ultimately, it comes down to the decision of one man: Sir Jim. And his current levels of patience will not sustain indefinitely.",
      "Meanwhile, the club legends are lining up to voice their dismay - Wayne Rooney says he has \"no faith\" that Amorim can turn things around. Gary Neville says for the first time, he is worried the players are \"really doubting the system\".",
      "Crystal Palace are proving that Amorim's chosen formation can be successful. Oliver Glasner has used a consistent 3-4-2-1 shape, and has delivered the FA Cup and Community Shield already, with this team having just beaten the champions.",
      "Palace's achievements are an example of how it could work for United, but also a reminder of how poorly the team is doing by comparison. Palace are flying high in third spot in the Premier League. United are 14th.",
      "It is still very early in the season, we are only six league matches in. But Amorim desperately needs his system to start paying dividends. And there is growing doubt about some of his decision-making.",
      "Against Brentford when United were chasing the game, the head coach changed his back five, in either personnel or position, six times. Mason Mount only came on in the 81st minute, but he played two different positions in what was left of the match - No 10 and left wing-back - a move that Neville called \"unforgivable\".",
      "No timescale has been set for Amorim to get it right. There is no deadline in terms of games, or set target in terms of wins. And yet there is a growing sense that United's next game - Sunderland at Old Trafford on Saturday - has the feeling of being a must-win for the home side.",
      "With the international break straight afterwards and a two-week gap in club football, if that one were to end badly, then the clamour for Amorim's removal would only grow, and Ratcliffe's determination to stick with his man would be severely tested.",
      "\"The sad thing about it for Man Utd and the supporters right now is it's not really a shock result - you look at Man Utd going to Brentford and I don't think many people would predict Man Utd would go and win. Brentford were fourth from bottom. And that's the sad state of affairs they find themselves in.\"",
      "Amorim's commitment to his 3-4-2-1 system has been a big talking point throughout his tenure.",
      "Carragher doesn't blame the Portuguese for sticking to that formation but asked why Sir Jim Ratcliffe and the United board chose Amorim to take on the job from Erik ten Hag when he didn't play a system typical of United's traditions.",
      "\"We keep talking about the system,\" said Carragher. \"It doesn't suit the players that are there, I totally understand that, but the powers that be that employed the manager knew what system he played and that's what gave him success.",
      "\"If you've had success as a manager, that's what you'll fall back on when things aren't going well. I can understand why he sticks with the system because that's his baby, that's his thing, that's what he does.",
      "\"The people in charge picked a manager who doesn't signify the traditions of that club going back 50, 60, 70 years. It's a big pitch [at Old Trafford], fast wingers... and the system he plays just doesn't employ them at all.",
      "\"It always felt a strange fit in terms of the system from the very start.\"",
      "Ruben Amorim is incredibly honest but also accurate when he reflects on and analyses his Manchester United side before and after games.",
      "So with the lack of European and Carabao Cup football, it is truly puzzling why United aren't able to address those flaws and show consistency with a full week to prepare on the training ground.",
      "Even more so, after they showed such grit and determination to beat Chelsea the weekend before only for it to evaporate at Brentford.",
      "The struggle for momentum pre-dates Amorim. United have not won back-to-back Premier League games in the same season since May 2024.",
      "The mental block in the squad is a problem he has inherited and one he continues to try to address.",
      "He has spoken about how he hoped the arrivals of Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo would alleviate that burden. But, despite some positive moments, it seems those old scars remain.",
      "Amorim has not yet shown the body of work at United that shows the required consistency is on the way. He would be the first to acknowledge that.",
      "Since his appointment, Amorim has picked up only 34 points in 33 Premier League games, a truly staggering statistic that nobody can hide from.",
      "One wonders how long the United leadership will allow this form to continue when you consider Amorim's predecessor, Erik ten Hag, was only given nine games last season before he was sacked.",
