      "Jason Wilcox, Manchester United director of football, has been criticised by club legend Peter Schmeichel(Image: Catherine Ivill/Getty Images)",
      "Angry Manchester United legend Peter Schmeichel has criticised the club's director of football, Jason Wilcox, following Ruben Amorim's recent exit. Amorim had previously expressed dissatisfaction with the footballing structure at Old Trafford, stating his preference for a managerial role with more oversight than that of a head coach.",
      "United's official statement asserted that parting ways with Amorim was in the best interest of their Premier League standing, but there were murmurs about tension between the 40-year-old and Wilcox, who oversees football operations.",
      "\"I was really, really surprised. I hadn't seen that coming, and I can't make sense of it. I still cannot make sense of why,\" Schmeichel told Viaplay.",
      "\"When you speak to people from within, they say, 'It was about time we did that, we've been unhappy'. But why pick that moment? That moment, it doesn't make sense to me. Why? Why now? Why not back in October, for instance?\"",
      "Schmeichel then criticised Wilcox, with the United legend stating: \"If Jason Wilcox feels that he was insulted by whatever happened in that meeting, then it's not his ego that determines or decides who the manager is.",
      "\"They can say, 'Okay, that's not great. It's difficult to work with this guy.' Whatever they're thinking, pick your time. And why put the club back again? No matter what they do now, it's always going to put them back.\"",
      "Whilst the search for the next permanent appointment continues, efforts are also underway to ensure United can navigate the remainder of the season as effectively as possible.",
      "Peter Schmeichel can't make sense of the timing of Ruben Amorim's axing(Image: Icon Sport via Getty Images)",
      "Darren Fletcher is currently serving as interim manager, having stepped in for the Burnley fixture midweek before taking charge again for the FA Cup clash with Brighton at the weekend.",
      "Discussions are taking place with Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and Michael Carrick regarding the caretaker position, which would bring some experienced leadership for what's left of the campaign.",
      "This approach would pave the way for a permanent appointment in the summer with a fresh start for the new season, something Amorim wasn't given when he arrived mid-campaign 14 months ago.",
      "It appears that Wilcox and Omar Berrada have taken their lessons on board, but the pressure will be on to ensure the next head coach is the perfect candidate who can finally steer United in the right direction.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Marcus Rashford is set to sign for Barcelona permanently(Image: Icon Sport via Getty Images)",
      "Barcelona have reportedly informed Marcus Rashford's agents of their plan to keep him beyond his current loan deal from Manchester United. The forward joined the Spanish giant on a season-long loan back in the summer.",
      "He has impressed at the Nou Camp. But there has been some uncertainty over his long-term future, despite Barcelona having an option to make the deal permanent at the end of the season.",
      "However, it now seems that a decision has been made. Journalist Fabrizio Romano claims that Barcelona plan to start negotiations in the next few months after making a firm decision to sign him permanently. The buy option as part of his loan agreement is valued at around €30 million (£26m).",
      "Rashford himself is now reported to have been informed of the decision and is 'delighted' with his time with the Catalan club so far. He has previously expressed his desire to stay at the club beyond his loan deal, meaning that there should be no doubts over the move on the player's side.",
      "Uncertainty over his long-term future came after United decided to part ways with manager Ruben Amorim at the start of the week. Rashford struggled for game time under the Portuguese manager, with him leaving on loan both to Aston Villa and Barcelona under the former United boss.",
      "There was some speculation that a new manager could impact Rashford's future, with the possibility of the new boss wanting to bring him back to Old Trafford and integrate him into the first-team picture.",
      "A recent report from Mundo Deportivo claimed that there was no guarantee that Barcelona would trigger the clause. They were instead planning to negotiate a lower fee.",
      "Despite a positive start to his Barcelona career, Rashford has found game time harder to come by in more recent times. The forward was dropped to the bench for the recent game against Villarreal and then lasted just the first half after starting against Espanyol.",
      "Rashford has enjoyed an impressive loan spell at Barcelona(Image: GSI/Icon Sport via Getty Images)",
      "He was named on the bench for the Super Cup semi-final against Athletic Club. He did, however, play the final 25 minutes of the 5-0 win.",
      "As well as Barcelona making the decision to start negotiations, it's already been reported that United have made up their mind over the player's future.",
      "It's reported that the decision for him to originally leave the club was led by United's hierarchy and not Amorim himself. It therefore means that the managerial situation at Old Trafford will not have too much of an impact on his future.",

      "Ole Gunnar Solskjaer is set for face-to-face talks with Manchester United chiefs on Saturday about the interim manager’s job. United are looking to make an appointment for the rest of the season, having taken the decision to call time on Ruben Amorim’s underwhelming 14-month reign on Monday.",
      "Ruud van Nistelrooy and current caretaker head coach Darren Fletcher have been under consideration for the post but Solskjaer and Michael Carrick are now considered to be the frontrunners. The latter, who worked as a first-team coach under Solskjaer and had a short interim spell in charge following his exit, met with United’s hierarchy earlier this week.",
      "The Press Association reports that Solskjaer will now meet with director of football Jason Wilcox and chief executive Omar Berrada on Saturday to discuss the role, following preliminary talks. The 1999 treble hero has already once been placed in charge of United following the sacking of a Portuguese coach having stepped in after Jose Mourinho’s exit in December 2018.",
      "Solskjaer was handed the permanent role in March 2019 and led United to runners-up spot in the Premier League in 2020/21. The Norwegian also took United to that season’s Europa League final before being sacked in November 2021.",
      "The former striker, who is back in Cheshire having been in Molde on Thursday for the funeral of Norwegian coaching legend Age Hareide, would appear to be up against Carrick for the caretaker role until the end of the season. The 44-year-old former midfielder is understood to have met with Berrada and Wilcox already and is available after leaving Middlesbrough last summer.",
      "Van Nistelrooy was United interim in October and November 2024 but has been ruled out of the running this time around. And speaking in a press conference ahead of Sunday's third-round FA Cup tie against Brighton, interim boss Fletcher suggested that he isn't currently being thought of as a contender for the role until the end of the season.",
      "Jason Wilcox (left) and Omar Berrada are in charge of the process(Image: PA Wire)",
      "\"I've not, no,\" he said when asked if he had spoken to owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe about his future. \"I speak to Omar and Jason. That's how the processes work. For me, I've been focusing on the job in hand, preparing the team for these two games.",
      "\"There's been no thought or conversation about my future. Honestly, the people in Jason and Omar have given me full responsibility to take control of these two games, make my own decisions, lead the team, guide the team, prepare the team, and that's what I've been doing.",
      "\"There's been no conversation with anybody outside of those two people in higher-up positions in the club.\"",

      "Manchester United have been warned that they need to grant their manager greater control at the club if they want to entice top-tier candidates in their hunt for Ruben Amorim's replacement. United decided to sack Amorim earlier this week, following his fiery post-match interview after the 1-1 draw with Leeds United.",
      "His remarks suggested friction between himself and technical director Jason Wilcox. The club is now focused on identifying a replacement, with their immediate priority being to appoint an interim manager until the end of the current campaign, before securing a permanent successor in the summer. Ole Gunnar Solskjaer is set to hold talks with the club over the weekend while Michael Carrick is said to have spoken to them already about taking the interim job.",
      "Various names, including Oliver Glasner and Thomas Tuchel, have been touted for the permanent role. Speaking on The Rest is Football Podcast, Gary Lineker questioned whether United could still appeal to elite managers given their recent difficulties.",
      "Micah Richards argued they could, but only if the incoming manager is permitted to select their own signings, enjoys complete autonomy and isn't subject to interference from above.",
      "\"I still think they'll want the job,\" he said. \"As a manager, you'll always think you can turn it round. I think the key question will be, 'do you have full control?'",
      "\"Are you a coach, or are you a manager? Do you get to pick the players that you want? Are you having people above you meddling with what you want to do on the pitch? If you have full control, 100 per cent.\"",
      "After Lineker pointed to Enzo Maresca's exit from Chelsea as evidence of modern managers lacking complete authority, Richards responded with: \"I understand it.",
      "\"For a little bit of balance, if you have a manager that comes in and he buys all these players and then, the new manager doesn't like those players and wants his own players. You end up with a huge bill, you might have paid massive transfer fees for these players and they say they're not moving because they don't like the options that are presented to them.",
      "\"Then you end up with an unsettled dressing room. I do understand why they get involved, but they need to work together.\"",
      "Alan Shearer then gave his thoughts. \"If you look at the top three in the league at the minute, Arsenal, City and Villa, all well run. All heavily influenced by the head coach or manager,\" he said.",
      "\"There's no way anyone is coming into City without Pep's say-so. There's no way anyone is coming into Villa without Emery's say-so and I'd say the same with Arsenal.",
      "\"When you look at those three clubs, maybe I'm wrong, but is it a coincidence the managers have a big say on who comes in?\".",
      "Before securing a permanent appointment, United must appoint an interim manager. Former boss Solskjaer and Michael Carrick are the frontrunners to take over until the end of the season.",
      "Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has been linked with a return to Manchester United. (Image: NurPhoto, NurPhoto via Getty Images)",
      "Discussing the situation, Lineker raised concerns about certain choices made by Sir Jim Ratcliffe and the United leadership, including the prospect of Solskjaer making a comeback to Old Trafford. He also suggested that the club's current state might affect whether top managers would be willing to take the job.",
      "\"I think they're already starting to make strange decisions even post-Amorim,\" he said. \"Bring in Darren Fletcher, fine, perfectly understandable to bring someone in like him to run the team,\" he said.",
      "\"Then, they're talking about bringing in another interim to run the team until the end of the season which doesn't make much sense. Who that will be, I don't really know. Who would go there?\".",
      "\"There's a few people available, you mentioned Thomas Tuchel. But, why would someone of that grade walk into that club because of all the examples that Alan gave?\".",
      "\"It's become a bit of a basket case of a football club. There's clearly all sorts of shenanigans going on at the very top and it's been significantly worse since Ratcliffe came in.",
      "\"You can speculate all you like as to who might be next but if they give it to Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and he does okay, then they'll be in a position, again, where they have to probably give it to someone that they don't really want to give it to.",
      "\"I don't know. They disposed of him just a few years ago.\"",

      "Darren Fletcher kicks off his interim Head Coach role at Man United this weekend in the FA Cup(Image: Ash Donelon/Manchester United via Getty Images)",
      "Manchester United, in pursuit of a third FA Cup final appearance in four seasons, begin their campaign with a third-round clash against Brighton & Hove Albion at Old Trafford on Sunday. Still without a permanent manager, the Red Devils opened the post-Ruben Amorim era with a 2-2 draw at Burnley in midweek Premier League action, while Brighton held Manchester City to a 1-1 draw, denting the champions' title hopes.",
      "As club officials consider candidates like Michael Carrick and Ole Gunnar Solskjaer for the managerial vacancy, another former United figure, Darren Fletcher, took charge as caretaker and oversaw a thrilling four-goal encounter at Turf Moor. Fletcher’s temporary leadership seemed to inspire Benjamin Sesko, who netted his first Premier League brace against Scott Parker’s struggling Burnley side. However, an own goal from Ayden Heaven and a stunning strike by Jaidon Anthony denied United all three points.",
      "United’s draw at Burnley marked their third consecutive stalemate in the league, mirroring the inconsistency that plagued the end of Amorim’s tenure. However, with FA Cup replays now abolished, Sunday’s tie must produce a winner.",
      "Despite ongoing struggles since Sir Alex Ferguson’s departure, Manchester United have not exited the FA Cup in the third round since the 2013-14 season, though they did fall to Fulham in the fifth round last year. Should they go all the way in 2025-26, United would match Arsenal’s record of 14 FA Cup triumphs and secure a route back to European competition for their next long-term manager.",
      "Fabian Hurzeler’s side have already frustrated one Manchester giant this year with their draw at the Etihad, but that result leaves them with just one win from their last eight matches. Brighton have also managed only a single away victory since October—a run that includes a 4-2 defeat at Old Trafford—and have been eliminated from the FA Cup by United six times, more than by any other club.",
      "Manchester United’s midfield received a boost at Burnley with the return of Bruno Fernandes and Kobbie Mainoo from injury. Mainoo, in particular, is expected to play a key role in a potential Red Devils resurgence following Ruben Amorim’s departure. Harry Maguire was also back on the bench after his own fitness concerns, leaving Matthijs de Ligt (back) as the only notable absentee for the hosts. However, Bryan Mbeumo, Amad Diallo, and Noussair Mazraoui remain unavailable as they continue their campaigns in the latter stages of the Africa Cup of Nations.",
      "A possible change in midfield could see Mainoo replace Casemiro, while Matheus Cunha is aiming to become just the fifth player in Premier League history to score in five consecutive FA Cup matches, joining the likes of Marc Overmars, Darren Bent, Wayne Rooney, and Romelu Lukaku.",
      "On the Brighton side, manager Fabian Hurzeler has confirmed that Joel Veltman and Charalampos Kostoulas—both of whom missed the draw with Manchester City due to minor injuries—are on track to be available for Sunday’s match. Yankuba Minteh (dead leg) remains a doubt, while Mats Wieffer (toe), Solly March (knee), Adam Webster (knee), and Stefanos Tzimas (knee) are still sidelined. Additionally, reported Manchester United target Carlos Baleba is absent as he continues to represent Cameroon at AFCON.",
      "Hurzeler also announced in his press conference that he plans to rotate his squad for the trip to Old Trafford, potentially giving opportunities to the likes of Jason Steele, former United striker Lewis Dunk, and the evergreen 40-year-old James Milner.",

      "He would improve United's chances of getting some stability. Gaining a genuine foothold, to give themselves something to build on when it comes to heading back in the right direction again.",
      "But Howe is not stupid. Like everyone else, he has watched United's chronic decline from a distance this past decade. He knows United are supremely dysfunctional. He knows the club's owners care more about profits than prizes.",

      "Amorim turned heads in the final weeks of his tenure by criticising what he perceived as an \"entitled\" attitude among some of the club's youngsters, having previously highlighted the struggles of Harry Amass and Chido Obi this season.",
      "Despite a spate of injuries, Amorim was hesitant to rely on the club's younger players. In contrast, interim boss Fletcher gave 18-year-old Shea Lacey a chance against Burnley on Wednesday, with the youngster nearly scoring a spectacular late winner in the 2-2 draw.",
      "As the under-18s coach for United, Fletcher is well-positioned to assess the academy's operations. He not only commended the talent within the academy but also defended their character.",
      "\"We've got an amazing record. I think it's hard to beat in terms of the history of clubs around the world. I think we've got some amazing players, some amazing talents. I think what I see is a lot of hard-working, humble young players who aren't perfect because they're young and they're learning and they've got a lot to do.",
      "\"I think we ask and expect too much of young people sometimes in society and in general, and that's not a criticism of anybody, that's just my beliefs. I think we have to let them learn, educate them, help them, understand they're going to make mistakes and they're going to do things that will frustrate you but through time with good guidance of coaches, family members, players in the first team squad, all of us play a part, that's our role, that's our job of developing them to be Manchester United players and Manchester United people.",

      "Fletcher has seen first-hand the talent on display among the next generation of players at Carrington as under-18s coach, but his words come in stark contrast to those of Amorim in December. \"He (Toby Collyer) played (for United). He's from the academy. He played here,\" the Red Devils boss began.",

      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe and the Man United hierarchy have come under fire following the dismissal of Ruben Amorim.(Image: )",
      "Alan Shearer has pinpointed seven significant errors made by the Manchester United management since Sir Jim Ratcliffe became a minority shareholder at Old Trafford. The Premier League's all-time leading goal scorer is of the opinion that United had no other option but to dismiss Ruben Amorim following his explosive press conference after the stalemate with Leeds United.",
      "Amorim lashed out at figures such as Gary Neville and United's sporting director Jason Wilcox, urging the latter to fulfil his role at the club. Less than a day later, the Portuguese head coach was shown the door.",
      "Speaking on the Rest is Football podcast, Shearer said: \"In whatever job you're in, in life you can't criticise your bosses like he did. Otherwise, you're going to run the risk of getting sacked, and no surprise that's exactly what happened.",
      "\"He has to take responsibility, and with the job he did, it was nowhere near good enough. He came in under very difficult circumstances and was very adamant he wasn't changing. It was all very mixed messages and systems.\"",
      "However, Shearer doesn't think that Amorim should shoulder all the blame for United's woes, outlining the blunders Ineos and Ratcliffe have committed since their arrival at the club.",
      "\"It didn't work for him, but I have to say, the people running the football club have to accept the blame as well,\" Shearer added. \"They made an absolute mess of it.",
      "\"We've seen and it's not the first time we've said this. If you look at every corner that they've tried to turn and every decision that they've made, it's been an absolute joke, whether it was giving Ten Hag a new deal.",
      "\"Whether it was sacking Ten Hag, paying Newcastle for Dan Ashworth and then him going on gardening leave. Then sacking Dan Ashworth and giving him a payoff. Then going to get Ruben Amorim and not accepting he has to come in now.",
      "\"Paying the money for him and his staff, then 14 months later, sacking him. The list goes on and on, whether it's staff or other decisions.",
      "\"The owners, Sir Jim Ratcliffe, Wilcox, Berrada, they have to accept their blame as well because they have made an absolute mess of every decision since they've been in there.\"",
      "Alan Shearer has slammed the Man United owners for key mistakes since Sir Jim Ratcliffe became minority owner.(Image: The Rest Is Football podcast)",
      "His co-host, Micah Richards, questioned if it was the right moment to show Amorim the door, to which Shearer responded: \"After what he said, there was no way back for him.",
      "\"You can't criticise your bosses like that in any walk of life and he wasn't in any position to criticise because of results and everything else. He hadn't done well enough to have a pop at his bosses.\"",
      "Richards, the ex-Man City defender, said: \"I agree with that to a certain extent, but I don't think it was the right time to get rid of him. The league has been a bit funny in terms of results, everyone is taking points off each other.",
      "\"They weren't far off the Champions League positions, they've got a window now where they can get new players, they've got players at AFCON and injured players. In terms of what he said, I totally agree with that.",
      "\"I think his position was untenable, but in terms of the team and structure, having to start again, I don't think it's right. What's the point in it? Solskjaer was deemed not good enough last time at Man United, now he's rumoured to come back until the end of the season until they can get a manager.",
      "\"There's been reports of Tuchel, I just don't understand the plan. The reason I asked that is, because Berrada, who was at Man City, is supposed to be an unbelievable operator in terms of getting players in, making sure the club is very stable, but I have to agree with you.",
      "\"The decisions, it seems like nobody knows what they're doing, which is frightening at the level we're talking about with a club the size of Manchester United.",
      "\"It's more confusion, but I don't think right now was the time to get rid of Amorim because you have to start again.\"",

      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe has plenty to sort out this month(Image: UEFA via Getty Images)",
      "It's been a turbulent week for Manchester United. Ruben Amorim's dismissal on Monday marked the sixth permanent manager to have come and gone in the post-Sir Alex Ferguson era.",
      "Attention has inevitably turned to who will replace the Portuguese coach, with both short-term and long-term options being lined up. However, the search for a new manager does not appear to have derailed United's transfer plans.",
      "On the contrary, links to several high-profile targets continue to gather momentum - and with the Red Devils within touching distance of the Champions League spots, fans are understandably eager to see the club show ambition in the transfer market this month. With that in mind, here are the latest Manchester United-related headlines:",
      "United's interest in Nottingham Forest midfielder Elliot Anderson is no secret and it looks as if they have a genuine chance of winning the race for his signature. United have now been described as \"serious contenders\" for the 23-year-old, who is valued at around £100million.",
      "The Red Devils won't have it all their own way, however. Manchester City and Chelsea are both closely monitoring Anderson's situation and possess the financial firepower to rival any bid.",
      "Even so, strengthening the midfield remains a key priority for United this year and Anderson is understood to be high on their shortlist. Any move is more likely to materialise in the summer, though, with Forest understandably reluctant to part with one of their standout performers midway through the season.",
      "\"It is going to be a summer move. So it's still early to mention a frontrunner,\" Fabrizio Romano explained on the Market Madness podcast. \"For sure, I can tell you that he's very high on the list of Manchester United, together with Carlos Baleba. There are two, three players that Man United are tracking. I think they will be busy with midfielders in 2026 and Anderson is one of them, for sure.",
      "Elliot Anderson is high on United's transfer wish list(Image: Getty Images)",
      "\"So I'm sure United will be in the conversation. Then there are going to be plenty of clubs keen on him. Also, the ones you mentioned, Man City are also going to look for midfielders. Let's see what happens at Chelsea.",
      "\"So I think it's going to be a big battle. But at the moment, what I can say is that Man United, for sure, have mentioned his name several times internally and so I expect them to be serious contenders at the table.\"",
      "Manchester United are closing in on the appointment of Ole Gunnar Solskjaer as interim head coach, with an announcement expected in the coming days. The Norwegian, who managed the club between 2018 and 2021, is set to replace Darren Fletcher, who was placed in temporary charge of the first team following Amorim's departure.",
      "Ole Gunnar Solskjaer is inching closer to a return to Manchester United(Image: NurPhoto, NurPhoto via Getty Images)",
      "Former United midfielder Michael Carrick has also been considered, but Solskjaer is understood to be the frontrunner. If confirmed, the 52-year-old would remain in charge until a permanent successor is appointed, either later on in the season or in the summer.",
      "Solskjaer's immediate task would be to guide United through the remainder of the season, with Champions League qualification the primary objective - something the club have failed to achieve in the past two campaigns. He would face a daunting start, with fixtures against Manchester City and Arsenal looming after Sunday's FA Cup tie against Brighton.",
      "Solskjaer was initially appointed as interim manager in 2018 following Jose Mourinho's dismissal. A strong upturn in results under his leadership led to him being handed the role on a permanent basis just a few months later.",

      "Weston-super-Mare have made themselves one of this season’s great FA Cup fairytales at the 84th attempt. The National League South side will take an army of 600 fans to Grimsby Town and are dreaming of going one step further in their remarkable cup run.",
      "Weston-super-Mare chairman Oli Bliss has finally taken the club into the third round for the first time in the club’s proud history. It has surpassed even his dad, former chairman Paul Bliss, who came within a whisker during his 39 years at the helm after reaching the second round in 2004 when they lost to Northampton Town.",
      "The father-and-son double act are enjoying the romance of the FA Cup but also know it means everything to non-league clubs like theirs.",
      "Weston-super-Mare, along with Macclesfield, are the lowest ranked team left in the FA Cup and the semi pro club’s line-up is made up teachers, sports coaches and labourers.",
      "They have had some support from England star Ollie Watkins - who had a loan spell at Weston-Super-Mare while he was a young player at Exeter City - who is still pals with current players Jacob Cane and Jason Pope and a signed Aston Villa shirt hangs on the wall off the clubhouse.",
      "And the clubhouse is really quite something in itself. The Optima Stadium holds 3,500 fans and sits on a roundhouse on the outskirts of the seaside town in the South West of England which is a 500 mile round trip to Grimsby.",
      "But this is what the FA Cup is all about. There is such a buzz around the place ahead of this weekend and the extra cash will help them strengthen the squad and potentially push through with their plans to develop a new 5,000 seater ground on the existing side.",
      "Oli reckons they have already banked £200,000 and the prize for the winners of Saturday’s tie is £121,500 and they will get £40,000 in TV money as the game is on being shown live on Discovery Plus.",
      "But Liverpool fan Oli does not want the run to end just yet. “The third round is such a big stage for non-league clubs,” he said. “We came close in 2004 but we were never in the game in the second round. They were too good for us.",

      "And Oli says he fully intends to give the players a bonus if they can land an FA Cup upset against Grimsby who have already caused a huge story themselves this season by knocking out Manchester United in the league cup.",
      "“We had a bonus structure - but I never expected to get this far so I’ll have to think of something else!” he said. “The players have already had a trip away to Liverpool, a night out on the town and they all went dressed as minions! I don’t know what they’ll do this time.”",
      "The romance is there for Weston-super-Mare. But the FA Cup is also a lifeblood for non-league clubs. The finances, driving interest in the club and allowing them to dream. It is huge for the whole football pyramid.",
      "An Aston Villa shirt hangs in the clubhouse(Image: Jonathan Buckmaster)",
      "Oli said: “It’s so important for non-league football because it affects the budget so much, it gives the fans a great day out and it can affect the season in the league as well which is what it’s done for us.",
      "“Crowds have increased a lot in non-league and there’s such a buzz around non-league football. I think the FA Cup is a big part of that.",
      "“It’s huge for us. We’re trying to improve the squad, build a new ground and we only budget for two cup wins so the first round proper, second round and now this is a real bonus.",
      "“If we’re able to keep going in the cup, we can put it into the development with 97 apartments, a new club house, all of this is going and we’ll have a whole new ground other than the pitch and the big stand at the end.",
      "Weston-super-Mare are hoping for a bit more FA Cup magic(Image: Jonathan Buckmaster)",
      "“Even before the game on Saturday, we’re already touching on about £200,000 which helps us keep pushing in the league - second at the moment - and it’s also huge for the fans.”",
      "They are already dreaming about who they could get if they get through. “My dad’s a Man United fan, but I’m Liverpool and so we’ll take either one of them.",
      "“In fact, any away day in the Premier League would be fantastic. But, please, away from home! It will mean so much to us financially.”",

So I think Harry will be in that situation for the weekend.\"",

      "Amorim waved goodbye to Old Trafford this week after just over a year in the hot seat and the hunt is now on to find a replacement. Darren Fletcher has taken over in the interim and his side drew 2-2 with Burnley on Wednesday.",
      "The departure of Amorim comes 14 months after Erik ten Hag's dismissal, with the Dutchman spending around two and a half years in charge. He arrived from Ajax, whereas Amorim came from Sporting CP, where he won two Portuguese league titles.",
      "With the search for their next head coach underway, Pulis believes that whoever they recruit should have either played or managed at a club of a similar size to United, due to the overwhelming sense of history.",
      "\"I want to stick with managers. I don't want to see managers get the sack. You want them to be given the chance and the opportunity,\" began Pulis, speaking on The Managers podcast.",

      "\"If you're looking at exactly what has happened with Ten Hag and Amorim and you have a look at the recruitment, the recruitment has been absolutely shocking,\" added Pulis.",
      "\"There is no getting away from it. Now, who is responsible for that? Has it been the two managers or has it been someone behind he scenes who might be there and still be picking players? When you are going into a job, you actually lay out what you want. I just think with those two managers, they had two years at top clubs, but it wasn't year after year after year.",

      "Jose Mourinho's assistant at Manchester United, Rui Faria, has posted a cryptic message after Ruben Amorim's exit(Image: (Photo by Stu Forster/Getty Images))",
      "Former Manchester United assistant boss Rui Faria has seemingly waded into the turmoil at Old Trafford with a mysterious social media message following Ruben Amorim's dismissal. The 50-year-old worked alongside Jose Mourinho at the club between 2016 and 2018, having previously been an integral part of the Portuguese tactician's backroom team at Porto, Chelsea, Real Madrid and Inter Milan.",
      "During his time at United, Faria was instrumental in securing Europa League and League Cup trophies, but departed in 2018 to prioritise spending more time with his loved ones. Now in 2026, things at Old Trafford remain remarkably similar, with the club once again searching for a new manager in their quest to recapture past glories.",
      "Amorim's axing has divided opinion, with supporters weighing up the poor results against the requirement for stability and a coherent long-term strategy. Following that decision, Faria appears to have reignited the debate with an Instagram post containing his own words alongside a Manchester United crest.",
      "The message stated: \"A great club's philosophy used to be about silverware. Coaches were hired for their winning streaks in order to achieve the club objectives. Today, coaches are often hired according to their willingness to accept a club's business plan.",
      "Rui Faria, the former assistant at Manchester United, has posted a cryptic message following Ruben Amorim's sacking(Image: (Photo by Clive Brunskill/Getty Images))",
      "\"Coaches are led to believe they're at the helm of a sports project in which they can manage their own decision-making while influencing different departments in order to achieve sporting success. The club's business plan, however, is essentially about numbers - with each department set up to achieve its own objectives, contesting any coaching decision that could hinder its own targets - regardless of on-field results.",
      "\"A winning football team is more than the sum of departmental parts and the setting of department-by-department objectives often comes at the cost of points and silverware won. Yet the coach still remains the face of an unsuccessful project - even when their power is reduced to almost nothing!\".",
      "This comes as Ineos, the minority stakeholders at Man United, face mounting questions about their handling of the club's footballing operations. Since Sir Jim Ratcliffe became involved at Old Trafford, there's been a deliberate push to revamp the sporting structure with top-tier personnel, creating a framework designed to maximise their resources in the transfer market.",
      "This has led to the appointments of Omar Berrada as CEO and Jason Wilcox as Director of Football within the senior management, with key decisions now flowing through them. They serve as the bridge between boardroom strategy and on-pitch performance, but following the difficulties surrounding Amorim as their first significant hire, doubts are emerging about their effectiveness and what lies ahead.",
      "At present, it seems that Man United will opt for a caretaker manager, as discussions are ongoing with Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and Michael Carrick about the position, before the next full-time appointment. While those talks continue, Darren Fletcher remains as the interim manager.",
      "The former midfielder took charge of Man United's 2-2 draw with Burnley in midweek and will be in the dugout for their FA Cup clash with Brighton. \"I have, and they informed me they'd like me to take the team for Sunday,\" Fletcher told the press when asked if he had spoken to the hierarchy about the Brighton game.",
      "\"I had the feeling that might be the case from Monday, but we wanted to focus on Burnley. So, I am tasked with leading the team on Sunday, and all my focus and energy goes into that.\"",
      "With United's early exit from the Carabao Cup at the hands of Grimsby Town, plus the chances of winning the Premier League looking more than unlikely, the FA Cup remains the last feasible hope of silverware this season. There will be some hope that, regardless of who is in the dugout, the club will make it into the fourth round.",
      "Amorim helped Man United overcome Arsenal and Leicester in last season's competition, before exiting at the fifth round stage to Fulham.",

      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe and Manchester United are searching for a new manager(Image: Michael Regan, Getty Images)",
      "Gareth Southgate has already made it clear that he's not in a hurry to get back into football management. The ex-England manager has previously been linked with the Manchester United job and is once again among the rumoured contenders.",
      "The 55-year-old guided the Three Lions to two European Championship finals during his nearly eight-year tenure. Since stepping down from his role following England's loss to Spain in the Euro 2024 final, Southgate has remained out of management.",
      "United are on the hunt for a new head coach after parting ways with Ruben Amorim earlier this week, with plans to appoint an interim coach before announcing a permanent replacement in the summer. While Darren Fletcher is currently in caretaker charge, United co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe is a known admirer of Southgate's work with England.",
      "The Daily Star reported that the Three Lions boss was the favourite to replace then-United manager Erik ten Hag in March 2024. It was suggested that Southgate was Ratcliffe's first choice, with incoming sporting director Dan Ashworth also a fan of the England manager.",
      "When Amorim found himself under pressure earlier this season, Southgate was once again the subject of speculation. This led the former England boss to clarify his position on taking up a new role in November.",
      "Speaking to BBC Breakfast, Southgate said: \"I had an amazing time, obviously the great thing with England is that there's this higher purpose. I joined the FA to try and help English football become better, and to help youth development in particular.",
      "\"I somehow stumbled and ended up in the first-team manager's job and we had a pretty good period. I'm not desperate to stay in football. I've had 37 years in football which is amazing.\"",
      "When questioned about whether he might reconsider if a major opportunity arose, he responded: \"Well you can never say never because I've just seen Martin O'Neill at his age go to Celtic.",
      "\"But it's not something that's high on my agenda at the moment, I'm enjoying the work around leadership, I'm enjoying my work with young people, very determined to try and make a difference there. And so no, I'm very relaxed about not being in football at the moment.\"",
      "Gareth Southgate reached two major finals as England manager(Image: Richard Sellers/Sportsphoto/Allstar via Getty Images)",
      "In October, reports emerged suggesting Southgate would require time and patience from the United hierarchy should he accept the role. The club's senior figures have faced mounting criticism following Amorim's final comments as United manager.",
      "Despite his impressive CV at international level, Southgate's experience as a Premier League manager remains limited. He previously managed Middlesbrough for three years, during which time the club suffered relegation to the Championship, before leaving in late 2009.",
      "Southgate's next role was as England U21 manager in 2013, a position he held until he was appointed as the senior team manager in September 2016. This means that Southgate has not managed a club side since October 2009.",
      "Southgate has not worked in football since resigning as England manager(Image: Adrian Dennis - WPA Pool/Getty Images)",
      "United legends Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and Michael Carrick have held discussions about taking over as interim manager for the rest of the season. Meanwhile, Fletcher took the reins for his first match as caretaker boss on Wednesday, guiding United to a 2-2 draw against Burnley.",
      "The 41-year-old, who is also being considered for the interim role, will get the opportunity to manage the team at Old Trafford this Sunday. United are poised to kick off their FA Cup campaign against Brighton, with the cup being the club's last realistic shot at securing a trophy this season.",

Ruben Amorim was sacked on Monday, leading the club's top brass to appoint Darren Fletcher as interim manager while they evaluate potential permanent replacements.",
      "However, the Norwegian could be in line to take the reins temporarily until the season's end, a role Solskjaer is reportedly eager to fill. While some might argue that bringing back the Baby Faced Assassin is a step in the wrong direction, there's no denying the affection Solskjaer holds for the club and continues to receive from supporters.",
      "A six-month stint at Old Trafford could see Solskjaer tasked with stabilising the team ahead of a new manager's arrival in the summer. However, with United vying for Champions League qualification and the FA Cup resuming this weekend, it could offer him a chance to leave his mark during his second tenure.",
      "Despite his sacking, Solskjaer remained a popular figure in the United dressing room, with his influence still very much felt. The 52-year-old could still make a significant impact, particularly if he decides to focus on two key areas, should he land the top job once more.",
      "Ole Gunnar Solskjaer handed out 16 first-team debuts to United's youngsters during his time in charge(Image: GLYN KIRK/AFP via Getty Images)",
      "Having spent 11 years playing under Sir Alex Ferguson, it's hardly surprising that Solskjaer is a staunch advocate of nurturing young talent, a fundamental part of United's ethos as a football club.",
      "Their youth record continues to astound fans to this day as the club have remarkably featured an academy graduate in every single first-team matchday squad since October 30, 1937. This streak has surpassed 4,000 consecutive games, a tradition Solskjaer upheld during his tenure.",
      "Solskjaer gave 16 club youngsters their first-team debuts, including Amad and Anthony Elanga. Amorim also handed debuts to Jack Fletcher and Shea Lacey this season, providing a clear pathway for the youth to the first team, a key aspect of both Solskjaer and United's identity.",
      "Arguably, Man United's only overwhelmingly successful transfer since Ferguson's retirement in 2013 is Bruno Fernandes, who has been a game-changer since his arrival in 2020. With 309 appearances in the red shirt, he's netted 103 goals and provided 94 assists.",
      "While these impressive stats haven't translated into significant success, United fans would shudder to think where they would be without their Portuguese captain. That was a scenario that almost became a reality last summer when Saudi Pro League side Al-Hilal reportedly tabled a £100million offer for the 31-year-old, which was turned down.",

With Amorim's exit, Fernandes has now served under three permanent managers, and Solskjaer - the gaffer who brought Fernandes to Old Trafford - may have his work cut out persuading the captain not to pursue a lucrative move to the Middle East.",

      "Lacey has been forced to watch as academy peers have been given their debuts over the last 18 months. United wrapped him up in cotton wool to protect him, and that foresight should now pay off.",
      "Lacey came close to scoring against Burnley.(Image: 2026 Robbie Jay Barratt - AMA)",
      "The youngster has carried a huge reputation within youth circles since he was a boy. For some, expectation and pressure are too much, but Lacey got his head down and stuck to his task.",
      "Ruben Amorim praised Lacey for his exemplary behaviour, which comes from his strong family grounding in Merseyside. The importance of hard work and staying humble was drilled into him from the start.",
      "At Turf Moor, he acknowledged a fan before getting on the team bus. A few years ago, Lacey went out of his way at Carrington, going back inside the building to gift boots to a fan.",
      "Lacey often took time to take photos with fans at Leigh Sports Village after academy fixtures and signed autographs before leaving the ground. The signature requests might be about to skyrocket this year.",
      "Amorim handed Lacey his senior bow against Aston Villa in the Premier League last month, and Tom Heaton gave him words of encouragement as he prepared to come on from the bench.",
      "Bruno Fernandes made a beeline for Lacey when he didn't get a chance to make his debut against Wolves at Molineux. United were leading 4-1, and it felt like the perfect moment for Lacey to come on. However, he had to bide his time and was rewarded at Villa Park just a few weeks later.",
      "Harry Maguire, who is represented by the same agency as Lacey, has also provided the youngster with advice. There is recognition from senior players about his quality and potential.",
      "Fernandes speaks to Lacey at Molineux.(Image: 2025 James Gill - Danehouse)",
      "It's rare to find someone who was born in Liverpool who supports United, but the youngest of three brothers, Shea is that anomaly. Lacey once had a season ticket at Anfield, but his middle brother, Luis, would complain that he wasn't interested in watching Liverpool.",
      "\"I can’t go from hating Liverpool in the morning when I’m playing against them, to supporting them,\" Lacey told his family, referencing how it felt to represent United's academy.",
      "Lacey's father is the reason he chose to join United's academy over Liverpool when he was just a boy. Shea's oldest brother, Paddy, came through Liverpool's youth system, despite his father telling him that Manchester was the best place for him to develop due to the better coaching.",
      "Neil Harris, former United academy coach for two decades, now a coach educator, spoke to the MEN this week and reflected: \"Shea was always cheeky, funny, mature when he was a boy, and he could hold his own with his coaches when it came to having fun. He was very mature for his age.",
      "\"As a footballer and a young player, he was exciting, and obviously being left-footed, he was always aesthetically pleasing when you looked at him. He could go past players and loved nutmegging people.",
      "\"The shot he did against Burnley, cutting in from the right, all the wonderful coaches who have worked with him down the years, we've seen that strike from Shea a thousand times.",
      "\"He loves cutting in and curling the shot into the top corner. Stuart Leicester at Ashton on Mersey on a Thursday, he would continually practice that shot with Shea whenever we worked with him.\"",
      "Lacey has spent over 10 years at the academy.(Image: )",
      "Harris continued: \"He always played with no fear. If something didn't come off on the pitch, he would just try it again. There would be no beating himself up, he wouldn't show any frustration, and he would just do it again. He had that arrogance about him - in a hugely positive and elite way.",
      "\"He's an exciting talent, and we're all hoping he kicks on now to the next stage. Hopefully the club give him time, but it would be exciting to see him play at the weekend in the FA Cup. He's a great kid, with a great family behind him, with wonderful brothers and mum and dad. We're dead proud of him.\"",
      "Those who know Lacey best noted he was probably the most frustrated they've seen after the final whistle at Turf Moor. A stunning last-minute winner from an academy graduate in Fletcher's first game as caretaker? Lacey's oldest brother was watching from the away section. It would have been perfect.",
      "Lacey was inches away from a special moment, but that would have spurred him on during sessions at Carrington this week as he trained hard in an attempt to win a place in the starting XI.",
      "The youngster must be under consideration to make his full debut at Old Trafford this weekend. Lacey is the kind of player worth paying an entry fee just to watch in person.",

Mazraoui's Morocco face Mbeumo's Cameroon in the tie, with the winners guaranteeing they will be at the competition for the final week.",
      "That means the winner will miss the Manchester derby next weekend, but Fletcher has confirmed the loser won't be rushed back to feature against the Seagulls on Sunday afternoon. \"I don't think so. I think it's too close a turnaround, so we'll have the same players available for the game as we had against Burnley,\" said Fletcher.",
      "\"So no new additions and, yeah, Bryan and Nous will not be available for the game.\" Fletcher confirmed that there would be no new faces in the squad to the group who drew with Burnley on Wednesday night, with Matthijs de Ligt still sidelined by a back injury.",
      "Harry Maguire was a surprise returnee to the squad at Turf Moor after two months out with a thigh injury and Fletcher confirmed he will be managed carefully.",
      "\"He has been out for a while, so it'd probably be looking at his load and things like that,\" said Fletcher. \"That decision's not been made, but I think you've seen the players coming back the other night.",
      "\"You've seen Mason, you've seen Kobbie, you've seen Bruno. There has to be some understanding of their first minutes. They might have to be careful a little bit with that process to build back in. So I think Harry will probably be in that situation for the weekend.\"",
      "Mainoo made his return from a calf injury at Turf Moor and looks set to stay at the club this month, having considered his future under Ruben Amorim, and Fletcher believes the academy graduate is settled again.",

      "\"I've had conversations with him in general. But he's in a good place. I know Kobbie, and I think he knows me. He knows Travis Binion, so he's comfortable with his environment. He's in a good place, he's trained well, and as I said, he's hard to read, Kobbie.\"",

It didn’t look great from Kyle’s point of view but I like him and I know him as a person so I hope his intent was to get the ball. Patrick thought his intention at the time was that Kyle was trying to get the ball and made contact with him. So that was his understanding of the incident in the moment. For me personally, I think VAR should have looked at it. They looked at the goal which was disallowed, which was ridiculous so they should have been looking at that for me and, as you say, if they don't they are just going to encourage players making massive dramas out of things and being theatrical which is what we don't want in the game. I don't want that for my players, I would tell my players not to do it but those two incidents were massive influences on the game Wednesday night so it shows you how influential it can be.",
      "It’s just feedback, talking to them, it's just trying to paint the picture of what to expect and how to deal with disappointments in games, how to see out different situations in games. There has not been a lot of time to practice it but video, we have reviewed the game against Burnley and some key details in that which we will try to improve on. It’s a constant thing which evolves over time for me, videos, conversations, coaching on the training ground, it is dealing with and learning from new experiences that happen within games and growing and building as a team, developing confidence and going on a run where you deal with those situations. Handling disappointment in football is everything on and off the pitch. Different situations in the game and recognising and understanding you have got 90 minutes to rectify things and nothing is going to be perfect. People are striving for perfection. Football is about chance, luck, opportunities, different things happening. Look at the game the other night, we conceded one shot on goal, another off target and draw 2-2 but that's football. We have a disallowed goal which is unfortunate but things happen in football but you’ve got to be able to deal with them constantly and just keep believing while there is 90 minutes on the clock that you can change it around.",
      "I think historically this club is built around the academy, we have got an amazing academy, our record speaks for itself. I can’t stand here and say anything other than that - we have got an amazing record and I think it is hard to beat in terms of the history of clubs around the world.

A decision has not been made [on his minutes] but when you see the players coming back the other night, you have seen Mason, Kobbie, Bruno, there has to be some understanding with their first minutes may have to be careful with that process to build back in. So I think Harry will be in that situation for the weekend.",
      "He seems in a good place. Kobbie doesn’t give you much so you wouldn't know if he was in a good place or not. He’s like that, it’s just his natural way, I know him well and I have known him for a long time, I’ve seen him around the building and had conversations with him. He’s in a good place, but I know Kobbie and he knows me and Travis Binnion and he’s comfortable with this environment. He is in a good place, he’s trained well and as I say he is hard to read, so that remains to be seen.",
      "It’s an important competition and Manchester United are about winning trophies. We’ve had good success in recent years, we won it a couple of years ago and lost in the final. It’s an amazing competition, the first trophy I won as a player, it is a special tournament. Not in Europe, out of the League Cup, there is the Premier League obviously but the FA Cup, it’s a trophy we should be vying to win and be giving ourselves every opportunity to win.",

The Mirror report that both the Glazers and Sir Jim Ratcliffe are not looking to get the legendary manager's input on the next hire. It comes as Man United announced an end to Amorim's 14-month reign at Old Trafford earlier this week, citing that it was the 'right time to make a change' for the highest possible finish in the Premier League.",

Caldwell, who shares a strong bond with the 41-year-old, reached out to Fletcher following the draw. He asked if the League One club could use United's Carrington training base before heading to the Etihad Stadium. When the request was made, Fletcher was serving as the Under-18s head coach at Old Trafford. However, he has since stepped into the caretaker role with the Reds after Ruben Amorim's dismissal on Monday.",

      "Rival fans are already preparing their memes in anticipation of Ole Gunnar Solskjaer returning to Manchester United for a second stint in the dugout. While his first crack at the job started well enough, particularly when he was interim head coach, things soon deteriorated. By the end of his spell, fans had turned on the club legend with the away end at Vicarage Road making their feelings clear after a pathetic defeat to Watford. Bruno Fernandes leapt to the defence of Solskjaer that afternoon but the damage was done and the Norwegian was gone.",
      "Ralf Rangnick delivered some home truths during his interim spell in charge but Erik ten Hag could only do so much. Ruben Amorim tried to implement the 'open heart surgery' that Rangnick diagnosed after Solskjaer's first spell but his stubbornness and livewire nature brought his tenure to a premature end.",
      "Read more here>>>",
      "\"You are my Solskjaer, my Ole Solskjaer, you make me happy, when skies are grey,\" came from the away section at Turf Moor just minutes into Manchester United's game against Burnley, a seal of approval from matchgoers ahead of a potential stunning managerial return for the Norwegian. Imagine if someone had told you that when Ruben Amorim was appointed, he would last just 14 months and Solskjaer would be hired as his interim successor for the rest of the season. Football tends to surprise. It's been a whirlwind week in Manchester following the sudden decision to sack Amorim, and it would be an incredible story if Solskjaer lands the interim gig.",
      "United have spoken to Solskjaer and Michael Carrick about the interim job for the remainder of the campaign. The suggestion is that it might be Solskjaer or Carrick who gets the job - not the pair together. Carrick was United caretaker for three matches when Solskjaer was sacked in 2021. He won games against Villarreal and Arsenal, and drew against Chelsea, to leave the position with an undefeated record.",
      "Read more here>>>",
      "The United press conference is starting a little later than usual this afternoon. The interim boss will be speaking to the media at 3.30pm with an embargo set until 4pm. Once that lifts, we shall be bringing you everything he has to say so stay tuned...",
      "Hello and welcome to our United press conference blog ahead of Sunday's FA Cup tie with Brighton.",
      "This weekend will mark Fletcher's second game in interim charge of the Reds. His first match resulted in a disappointing 2-2 draw with Burnley on Wednesday night. United had looked good value for a victory after Sesko's brace but poor defending cost them. Whether this weekend will be Fletcher's second and final game in interim charge of United remains to be seen.",
      "Solskjaer and Carrick are among the former players who Ineos have been talking to about taking on the caretaker role until the end of the season. Both men have more experience than Fletcher as a head coach. Should either man be appointed next week, their first game in charge will be the Manchester derby.",

I'm intrigued,\" he said. \"Why do they keep giving certain people a job? What happens in the interview that they sit there and go, and 12, 14 months later, \"he's not the guy for us.\"",
      "'Do you not suss that out when you speak to them? You look somebody in the eye and go... You see who's making the decisions at Manchester United... you still have [Alex] Ferguson and David Gill [former chief executive] hanging on like a bad smell.",
      "'Who's making the decisions? [Sir Jim] Ratcliffe, [Jason] Wilcox? Who's coming into this interview process, you're speaking to a manager, you get a feel for somebody and go \"he's the guy for us?\"",
      "'Almost forget the CV. You need something on our CV, of course, that you've won a trophy or managed a long time. But you've got to look somebody in the eye and go \"are you the man to get us places?\"",
      "On the latest Rest is Football podcast, Gary Lineker asked the question whether Manchester United could still attract a world-class manager, given their recent struggles.",

      "\"We've seen the previous manager going in - I like people with emotion, obviously I'm quite an emotional person - but I think his calmness, what he's done at Newcastle, Champions League a couple of times, winning the (League) Cup. I'd be happy to see him go in there.\"",

      "“Roy’s a big name and a legend – but so was Bryan Robson, and he never got the chance to manage United even though he was in the management game for a period of time,” he said via Hard Rock Bet.",
      "“Roy’s dipped in and out of management and made his name as an outspoken pundit now. He’s good value when you see him on the TV. He’d certainly command respect in the dressing room and shape it up, I have no doubt about that.",
      "“But with what has gone on with Roy, I’m not sure. Maybe if it was seven or eight years ago, you would’ve thought of it as a possible chance, but he’s been out of management for a long time and has been very critical of United publicly.\"",

      "We will hear from Darren Fletcher today ahead of the weekend's FA Cup clash with Brighton. We'll bring you the latest news on the hunt for an appointment for the rest of the season.",
      "Aston Villa star Morgan Rogers speaks very fondly of Michael Carrick, describing him as a manager who stood out during the early stages of his career. Carrick is one of the contenders to take interim charge at Manchester United, alongside Ole Gunnar Solskjaer.",
      "Both coaches previously worked together at Old Trafford, with Carrick forming part of Solskjaer's backroom team. While there are plenty of questions about who might be best suited for the role, Rogers has already given his own verdict on Carrick.",
      "When Darren Fletcher was announced as the interim head coach of Manchester United, there was an immediate expectation that the Scot would make changes when he took charge of the Reds for the trip to Burnley. The first expected change was confirmed in his team selection as the Reds reverted to a back four.",
      "Changing their defensive shape was almost a guarantee considering the issues raised with Ruben Amorim's three-at-the-back system. Amorim's most fatal failing was persisting with his preferred formation when all the signs showed it couldn't be done with the players available.",
      "After a 2-2 draw to struggling Burnley, the jury remains firmly out on whether the back four will make United noticeably better in the long term. However, another change Fletcher made has brought about instant results for the Reds.",
      "Manchester United insiders have questioned the mentality of the dressing room this season because points have often been dropped from winning positions in the Premier League. United conceded first against Burnley at Turf Moor on Wednesday night, but they fought back to lead in the second half after a Benjamin Sesko brace.",
      "Just six minutes after Sesko fired United into the lead, Burnley forward Jaidon Anthony found the back of the net to ensure the points were shared. Only West Ham, Chelsea and Bournemouth have dropped more points from winning positions than United this season. The Reds have lost a total of 14 points from winning positions.",
      "It's understood that United insiders have questioned the mentality of the players, who have often failed to demonstrate the know-how to see out a victory after taking the lead this term. United insiders believe they should have won against Burnley, which Darren Fletcher admitted when he spoke about dropping points during his post-match press conference.",
      "To a casual observer, it would be easy to cast Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's last foray into management with Besiktas as a failure.",
      "Sacked after just eight months in charge after failing to qualify for either the Europa League or the Europa Conference League doesn't look great on paper for the man in contention to return to Manchester United as interim boss. But that doesn't tell the full story of Solskjaer's time in Turkey, according to football journalist and Besiktas podcaster Kaan Bayazit.",
      "Solskjaer was appointed by a club in crisis one year ago, before lifting them from seventh to a fourth-place finish in the Super Lig. He pulled off a memorable Europa League win over Athletic Bilbao in his first match and beat their arch city rivals, Galatasaray, to retain a proud club milestone.",
      "Manchester United are preparing for an FA Cup third-round match against Brighton while simultaneously searching the transfer market for new players and a manager. The Red Devils recently parted ways with Ruben Amorim after 14 months in charge, with Darren Fletcher stepping in as caretaker manager.",
      "Speculation continues to circulate about who will take over the managerial reins, whether on a temporary or permanent basis. The incoming boss will undoubtedly need to bolster the squad as United strive for a top finish in the Premier League this season.",
      "Currently positioned seventh in the league following a 2-2 draw with Burnley on Wednesday evening, United's next challenge is the Manchester derby in the Premier League. However, their immediate focus is on Brighton in the FA Cup, a team that managed a 1-1 draw against Manchester City on Monday.",
      "When Ruben Amorim offered up some mild criticism of Benjamin Sesko earlier this season, as the £73million striker tried to settle into life at Old Trafford, it again set alarm bells ringing amongst Manchester United officials. Amorim had wanted United to sign the more experienced Ollie Watkins, who also came with proven Premier League pedigree, rather than raid RB Leipzig for 22-year-old Sesko, who came with a glowing reputation from director of recruitment Christopher Vivell.",
      "When the Slovenian struggled in the first few months at United, Amorim admitted he was finding the search for form hard, suggested he was taking criticism to heart and said he was a \"control freak\". United officials were bemused by what he wanted to get from the comments.",
      "Darren Fletcher will be back in the dugout for Manchester United on Sunday, when they play host Brighton and Hove Albion in the FA Cup third round.",
      "It comes as the club continue their search to appoint a new head coach following the sacking of Ruben Amorim.",
      "Man United winger Patrick Dorgu has insisted that Amorim was wrong to claim he had been playing nervously.",
      "\"I don’t think those were the words he was looking for,\" he said. \"But I don’t agree that I’ve been nervous.",
      "\"But I do agree that I haven’t played as well as I have with the national team. I haven’t been lying at home and being angry that he has criticised me.\"",
      "According to TEAMtalk, Tottenham are interested in 46‑year‑old Italian manager Roberto De Zerbi, though he is believed to favour a move to Man United instead.",
      "It is said that De Zerbi views the Manchester United job as a 'dream opportunity' to manage the club. Although he is under contract at Marseille until the summer of 2027, he is reportedly open to leaving this summer if the right offer arrives, believing he has 'taken the French club as far as he can.'"

Morocco's progression in the competition means that the full-back will likely remain unavailable for United for next weekend's Premier League clash against Man City, but that is now not expected to be the case for Mbeumo, who could be available.",

      "There was a worry for United in the second half when Mbeumo looked to be hurt following a challenge. The United man hobbled away from the incident, but to the relief of United was able to carry on as normal and showed no ill effects.",
      "Morocco sealed their win in the second half when Ismael Saibari scored to make it 2-0 in the 74th minute.",
      "Despite pushing to get back in the game, Cameroon couldn't find a way past the tournament hosts. Mbeumo played the full 90 minutes of the game.",

United are seeking to appoint a temporary manager for the remainder of the season, following the decision to call time on Ruben Amorim's 14-month tenure on Monday.",
      "Ruud van Nistelrooy and current interim head coach Darren Fletcher were considered for the role, but now Solskjaer and Michael Carrick are seen as the leading contenders. Carrick, who previously served as a first-team coach under Solskjaer and had a brief stint in charge after his departure, met with United's hierarchy earlier this week.",

      "“When you look at those three clubs, maybe I’m wrong, but is it a coincidence the managers have a big say on who comes in?”",
      "Before looking towards that permanent appointment, United need to bring in an interim boss. The club have held talks with former manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and Michael Carrick over the role.",
      "Speaking about the situation, Lineker questioned some of the decisions made by Sir Jim Ratcliffe and the United hierarchy, pointing towards the possibility of Solskjaer returning to the club. He has also hinted that the situation at the club could influence the decisions of some managers.",

      "“Then, they’re talking about bringing in another interim to run the team until the end of the season which doesn’t make much sense. Who that will be, I don’t really know. Who would go there?",

      "“It’s become a bit of a basket case of a football club. There’s clearly all sorts of shenanigans going on at the very top and it’s been significantly worse since Ratcliffe came in.",

      "Alan Shearer has taken aim at the Manchester United owners and Sir Jim Ratcliffe for making seven key mistakes.(Image: The Rest Is Football)",
      "Alan Shearer has listed seven major decisions the Manchester United hierarchy has got wrong since Sir Jim Ratcliffe took over as a minority shareholder at Old Trafford. The Premier League's all-time leading goalscorer believes United had no choice but to sack Ruben Amorim following his press conference outburst after the draw with Leeds United.",
      "Amorim took aim at the likes of Gary Neville and United sporting director Jason Wilcox, calling on the latter to do his job at the club. Less than 24 hours later, the Portuguese head coach had been relieved of his duties.",
      "Shearer told the Rest is Football podcast: \"In whatever job you’re in, in life you can’t criticise your bosses like he did. Otherwise, you’re going to run the risk of getting sacked, and no surprise that’s exactly what happened. He has to take responsibility, and with the job he did, it was nowhere near good enough.",
      "\"He came in under very difficult circumstances and was very adamant he wasn’t changing. It was all very mixed messages and systems.\"",
      "However, Shearer does not believe that the full blame for United's struggles lies with Amorim, listing off the mistakes Ineos and Ratcliffe have made since coming into the club.",
      "\"It didn’t work for him, but I have to say, the people running the football club have to accept the blame as well,\" Shearer added. \"They made an absolute mess of it.",
      "\"We’ve seen and it’s not the first time we’ve said this. If you look at every corner that they’ve tried to turn and every decision that they’ve made, it’s been an absolute joke, whether it was giving Ten Hag a new deal.",
      "\"Whether it was sacking Ten Hag, paying Newcastle for Dan Ashworth and then him going on gardening leave. Then sacking Dan Ashworth and giving him a payoff. Then going to get Ruben Amorim and not accepting he has to come in now.",
      "\"Paying the money for him and his staff, then 14 months later, sacking him. The list goes on and on, whether it’s staff or other decisions.",
      "\"The owners, Sir Jim Ratcliffe, Wilcox, Berrada, they have to accept their blame as well because they have made an absolute mess of every decision since they’ve been in there.\"",
      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe with Omar Berrada and Jason Wilcox during the Premier League match between Wolverhampton Wanderers and Manchester United at Molineux. (Image: Catherine Ivill - AMA/Getty Images)",
      "Fellow co-host Michah Richards asked whether it was the right time to get rid of Amorim and Shearer made it clear: “After what he said, there was no way back for him.",
      "\"You can’t criticise your bosses like that in any walk of life and he wasn’t in any position to criticise because of results and everything else. He hadn’t done well enough to have a pop at his bosses.\"",
      "To which the former Man City defender replied: \"I agree with that to a certain extent, but I don’t think it was the right time to get rid of him. The league has been a bit funny in terms of results, everyone is taking points off each other.",
      "\"They weren’t far off the Champions League positions, they’ve got a window now where they can get new players, they’ve got players at AFCON and injured players. In terms of what he said, I totally agree with that.",
      "\"I think his position was untenable, but in terms of the team and structure, having to start again, I don’t think it’s right. What’s the point in it? Solskjaer was deemed not good enough last time at Man United, now he’s rumoured to come back until the end of the season until they can get a manager.",
      "\"There’s been reports of Tuchel, I just don’t understand the plan. The reason I asked that is, because Berrada, who was at Man City, is supposed to be an unbelievable operator in terms of getting players in, making sure the club is very stable, but I have to agree with you.",
      "\"The decisions, it seems like nobody knows what they’re doing, which is frightening at the level we’re talking about with a club the size of Manchester United.",
      "\"It’s more confusion, but I don’t think right now was the time to get rid of Amorim because you have to start again.\"",

      "\"You are my Solskjaer, my Ole Solskjaer, you make me happy, when skies are grey,\" came from the away section at Turf Moor just minutes into Manchester United's game against Burnley, a seal of approval from matchgoers ahead of a potential stunning managerial return for the Norwegian.",
      "Imagine if someone had told you that when Ruben Amorim was appointed, he would last just 14 months and Solskjaer would be hired as his interim successor for the rest of the season. Football tends to surprise. It's been a whirlwind week in Manchester following the sudden decision to sack Amorim, and it would be an incredible story if Solskjaer lands the interim gig.",
      "United have spoken to Solskjaer and Michael Carrick about the interim job for the remainder of the campaign. The suggestion is that it might be Solskjaer or Carrick who gets the job - not the pair together. Carrick was United caretaker for three matches when Solskjaer was sacked in 2021. He won games against Villarreal and Arsenal, and drew against Chelsea, to leave the position with an undefeated record.",
      "The former midfielder subsequently managed Middlesbrough. Carrick guided Boro to the play-offs in 2022/23, but he failed to secure a top six finish in successive campaigns and was sacked last June.",
      "In August, Solskjaer was sacked by Besiktas after being knocked out of the Europa League and the Conference League play-off round, leaving the Turkish club with no European football. Carrick and Solskjaer would both be capable interims, however, as they have previous coaching experience with the club and would likely inspire an upturn in results by implementing a different system.",
      "Solskjaer seems slightly ahead of Carrick in the minds of fans, though. The 52-year-old departed on good terms when he was sacked, despite being booed at Vicarage Road after his final game in charge, but there are pros and cons to his possible return, which must be considered by decision-makers.",
      "Solskjaer after his final game against Watford.(Image: )",
      "The positives about Solskjaer's potential return are that he is almost guaranteed to enjoy a new manager bounce (he won 14 from 19 games as interim in 2018/2019), he would improve morale and he would play a formation that would chime with the players.",
      "The cons are that appointing Solskjaer is the kind of decision the previous regime would make, the end of the Norwegian's tenure at United was brutal, and what happens if he does well as interim boss? Would they dare to give him the job on a permanent basis again? United are still well-positioned to secure European football, and Solskjaer could possibly steer the club back into the Champions League.",
      "It would be difficult not to give Solskjaer the job on a permanent basis if he secured Champions League football. His position would be strengthened, and fans could be lulled into giving him another proper bite at the cherry.",
      "United's decision-making was influenced by fan pressure after the FA Cup final success in 2024, with Ineos deciding to extend Erik ten Hag's contract despite the overwhelming evidence to sack him.",
      "The pressure from fans, and Solskjaer's allies in the media, would be even bigger to give him the job permanently if the Norwegian had a strong impact. The Ineos hierarchy has shown they are capable of making such errors of judgement, and they appear to take notice of external noise.",
      "\"If people can't handle the Gary Nevilles or any other criticism, we need to change the club,\" said Amorim during an explosive final press conference, suggesting that Jason Wilcox and co had been influenced by comments in the media, so just imagine what Neville would say if Solskjaer did well as interim.",
      "The condition for Solskjaer's potential return should be that he won't be given the job permanently, regardless of what he achieves as interim. No elite club would hire Solskjaer on a permanent basis in 2026.",

      "Fletcher has been appointed on an interim basis and Burnley could be his only game in charge, with talks having taken place with Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and Michael Carrick this week. The former midfielder has made just one change from the draw with Leeds, recalling Fernandes to the starting team at the expense of Leny Yoro, and Fletcher is expected to play with four at the back.",

      "\"But the players are the ones who cross the white line who have to deliver. We've got some smart, experienced players. If they see something, I trust them to have the autonomy to exploit it.\"",
      "The 41-year-old also confirmed that starting Fernandes upon his return from injury was always the plan. \"It's important Bruno's back but that was always part of the plan,\" he explained.",
      "\"This game was targeted for a couple of players coming back from injury so we've got a stronger bench tonight. Looking forward to seeing the lads play, we've set them up in a way we think is best for us to win the match that suits their personalities and suits their styles and it's up to them to execute it.\"",

      "Darren Fletcher won't tell his former teammates now working in the media to go easy on his Manchester United team, despite the criticism being levelled at players and the club being raised under Ruben Amorim. In his press conference broadside at club officials on Sunday, Amorim suggested that even executives were influenced by criticism from the likes of Gary Neville.",
      "The club's former right-back is one of a cohort of United greats who have waded in on the club in their media roles, with Roy Keane and Paul Scholes also heavily critical. Those attacks have damaged the confidence of some players and caused divisions between the dressing room and some United greats, but Fletcher believes those now wearing the shirt should embrace the challenge that comes with the pressure of being at the club.",
      "\"You can’t ask them to go easier because they're passionate guys and I think they're right to their opinion and they're really good,\" Fletcher said of the critical pundits he played with. \"They're engaging, they're good to listen to. I enjoy listening to them, you know. I had years of listening to them in the dressing room and I used to sit and listen to them and take it all in.",
      "\"Outside noise, ex-players, it's difficult to deal with, it's not easy because those players have won everything. They've got success behind them, they've got trophies, so it's hard to criticise them back because they've got their medals on the table, so it's really, really difficult.",
      "\"But again, that's what it is being a Manchester United player. Get your head around it, learn how you're going to deal with it, and embrace the challenge.\"",
      "Although the withering attacks on a string of disappointing performances and underwhelming seasons have been seen internally as damaging, Fletcher turned the equation on its head and said players should be grateful for the support they receive inside Old Trafford.",
      "Supporters have rarely turned on the team despite their struggles, with Fletcher pointing out that wouldn't be the case everywhere given the struggles United have endured in recent years, with finishes of sixth, eighth and 15th in three of the previous four seasons.",
      "\"People want to win football games, people want to be entertained, people have a standard of what Manchester United is and what Manchester United expects,\" said Fletcher.",
      "\"I think the fans, especially in Old Trafford, have been amazing in recent years, if I'm perfectly honest with you. I think there's been a few moments here and there, but in general the support that the fans have given players, managers, understanding of the situation, I think it could have been a lot worse inside the stadium.",
      "\"I've probably experienced other stadiums where there has been a lot more pressure and hostile, so maybe the players have to deal with that noise more than actual stadium sort of pressure.",
      "\"So that should help and I think the fans have been amazing in that and I'm going to sit here today and ask them to support the players. Not me, support the players in the club, because they need it and they need that help.\"",

      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe's decision to appoint Ruben Amorim in November 2024 was a surprise after he hadn't really featured in discussions that summer(Image: )",
      "The irony of Manchester United's new power structure appointing Ruben Amorim as the club's first head coach in November 2024 is that a few months earlier, his name hadn't really been in the frame at all. That was the summer when Liverpool considered appointing Amorim, only to opt for Arne Slot amid concerns over the Portuguese's system, his stubbornness in playing it and how the squad would fit. Those concerns were cast aside at Old Trafford later in the year.",
      "But for a few heady, confusing weeks in the summer of 2024, change was in the air at United, too. Sir Jim Ratcliffe had decided to sack Erik ten Hag and contenders to replace him were lined up on the catwalk. Then Ten Hag won the FA Cup final, United dithered and the Dutchman stayed, new contract, pay rise and all.",
      "Before that, Ratcliffe spoke to potential replacements as United scoured the market. They met with Thomas Tuchel in Monaco and the German was right at the top of the list of likely appointments, should they have gone through with the decision to dispense with Ten Hag.",
      "There were also talks with Premier League managers, as Marco Silva, Thomas Frank and Roberto De Zerbi were all considered. However, there was little indication that Amorim was part of the conversation before the Ibiza summit, which led to Ten Hag staying.",
      "That decision was reversed within four months, with no improvement in results under the Dutchman. As United looked for a replacement this time, Amorim was high on the shortlist. For all the reservations of the then sporting director, Dan Ashworth, and his colleagues at Anfield, the Sporting head coach's stock was high.",
      "Perhaps the switch to Amorim and a coach with such a unique style of play can be attributed to chief executive Omar Berrada settling into the job. Berrada was particularly taken by Amorim's personality and charisma. Speaking to the BBC in March of this year, Ratcliffe explained the decision to stick with Ten Hag as one made at \"short notice\".",
      "\"At the end of the day, we are a consensus organisation,\" he said. \"So there's a collection of us who make decisions. It's not just me that makes the decision, it involves that management team.",
      "\"If you look at the time we made the decision about Erik the management team hadn't been in place more than five minutes. Omar [Berrada] had only just arrived, Jason [Wilcox] had not been there terribly long, so we didn't really have the management team in place for very long to make… it was a very difficult decision to make at short notice.\"",
      "That consensus was lacking when Amorim was appointed. Berrada and Ratcliffe might have been on board with the decision, but Wilcox needed convincing and Ashworth's doubts never dissipated. Having insisted that a football structure would make a decision on a style of play, Ratcliffe turned to a head coach who was unique in this department.",
      "What does that tell us about the next search for a head coach, now that Amorim has gone? The structure is more settled, with Ashworth having also left. Berrada and Wilcox are the key figures, with director of recruitment Christopher Vivell on the rise. Ratcliffe will again be involved.",
      "The management team that Ratcliffe discussed should be able to make the right decision this time, but they will be under pressure to do so. Given the names under consideration in June 2024, the decision to appoint Amorim felt like a change in strategy. Maybe it warns us to expect the unexpected as United consider their options this time around.",

      "Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and Michael Carrick emerge as the frontrunners. Nevertheless, the visiting supporters at Burnley have voiced their opinions on the circumstances.",
      "A banner declaring: \"JIM CAN'T FIX THIS\" was visible from the away section before kick-off. Jason Wilcox and Omar Berrada have also faced criticism this week.",
      "Manchester United fans hold up a sign protesting against Sir Jim Ratcliffe ahead of their match at Burnley.(Image: )",
      "It's believed that Wilcox arranged a discussion with Amorim last week regarding tactical matters, though it ended with both parties failing to reach a consensus.",
      "Prior to the match, it was revealed that Solskjaer and Carrick had both held additional discussions with the United hierarchy.",
      "Solskjaer is reportedly the preferred choice to assume control for the remainder of this campaign, having previously excelled in the Old Trafford hot seat.",
      "The Norwegian succeeded Jose Mourinho in 2018 and secured victory in 14 of his 19 matches as interim manager before receiving the permanent appointment.",
      "He guided the club to a runner-up position and consecutive top-four placings, though was dismissed in November 2021.",
      "Solskjaer is set to return to Norway tomorrow from his Cheshire residence to attend a close friend's funeral.",
      "However, it's understood that he could be appointed before the start of next week. A permanent successor is anticipated to take over at the end of the season.",
      "Thomas Tuchel, who was previously targeted before the appointment of Amorim in November 2024, remains a top contender.",
      "Other potential candidates include Carlo Ancelotti and Mauricio Pochettino.",

      "Darren Fletcher has been tasked with returning Manchester United to winning ways at Burnley this evening(Image: Manchester United/Manchester United via Getty Images)",
      "It will be a proud night for the Fletcher family when Darren enters the dugout, potentially with sons Jack and Tyler following, for Manchester United's Premier League clash with Burnley at Turf Moor. The 41-year-old was appointed interim manager of the Reds on Monday following the sacking of Ruben Amorim.",
      "In his first press conference, Fletcher refused to say whether his twin sons, who joined from Manchester City in 2023, would be part of the matchday squad. But if they are, it will undoubtedly be the first time a manager and his twins have been part of the backroom staff and squad in the Premier League.",
      "While that is not a guarantee to happen tonight, there are some scenarios which we expect to pan out at Turf Moor during Fletcher's first game in charge of the Reds. So with this in mind, MEN Sport has taken a look at what we think will happen.",
      "Considering the fallout from Amorim's sacking, it seems highly unlikely Fletcher will choose to stick with a back three formation. The Portuguese head coach looked to appease the owners on Boxing Day by playing a back four against Newcastle and it worked.",
      "By no means was the performance perfect, particularly in the second half, but it was the last time United tasted victory and it seems certain the back four will return at Turf Moor. It also makes more sense to play a four at the back now, considering the players at Fletcher's disposal.",
      "Amad is United's best wing-back but he is currently away at the Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON). Diogo Dalot has played on the left and right, but he is much better as a full-back and thus a return to this system would be beneficial for the Reds.",
      "There must have been an audible sigh of relief among United households across the world when Fletcher announced Bruno Fernandes would be back in the matchday squad tonight. Not only is Fernandes the captain, but he is also the star player in a team which struggles for consistency.",
      "You have to wonder in the games against Wolves and Leeds whether United would have won had Fernandes been on the park. The Portuguese midfielder has a knack of creating moments of magic out of seemingly impossible situations and his creativity has been missed desperately.",
      "Of course, Fernandes may not play the full 90 minutes, considering his recent return from injury. But, we can expect Fletcher to lean in heavily on the captain and potentially even start him - if only for the first 45 minutes - to rouse the troops.",
      "Whether the fans make their feelings towards the boardroom clear tonight will be interesting to see. A lot of supporters have been left angered by the manner in which Sir Jim Ratcliffe has run football operations since acquiring a minority stake in the club.",
      "This does not necessarily mean they are unhappy Amorim has gone, but there will likely be a large amount of fans travelling to Burnley who feel Ratcliffe has embarrassed the club with another quick upheaval. Should the travelling supporters voice those opinions, remains to be seen.",
      "What is not in doubt is the rousing reception Fletcher will receive as he strides out at Turf Moor this evening. United fans adore most of their ex-players, as will be proven if Ole Gunnar Solskjaer takes on the caretaker role until the end of the season.",
      "And one certainty Fletcher can rely on is the away fans backing both him and the team tonight.",

      "Lammens made an impressive debut against Sunderland.(Image: Getty Images)",
      "Senne Lammens wore a polo shirt and a navy sweatshirt when he visited Old Trafford after signing for Manchester United. The young goalkeeper looked as though he could be joining United to work in their HR department.",
      "The same observation was made when Lammens reported for international duty with Belgium last week - the 23-year-old was dressed in a beige collared jacket, a khaki t-shirt and chinos.",
      "\"By accident, I saw an article saying he was wearing something boring when he reported for international duty and fans saying they hoped he stays like this,\" laughed Hayk Milkon, one of Lammens' former coaches.",
      "\"This 'boringness' is just the way Senne is, he's really calm and no excesses. He focuses on what he needs to focus on and is open with the people around him. He keeps his feet on the ground.\"",
      "If Lammens looks like someone who could work in an office, every workplace would love to have him in their five-a-side team. United believe they have signed a young goalkeeper with huge potential, and fans who were present at Old Trafford against Sunderland left the stadium buzzing about his debut.",
      "The quirk is that Lammens appears to be a different person when he wears his goalkeeper kit. He made a supremely confident United debut, aggressively commanded his area and kept a clean sheet.",
      "Milkon coached Lammens during their time together at Club Brugge. Milkon is now the youngest manager in the Belgian top-flight and Lammens plays for the biggest club in England.",
      "\"It was Senne with his headphones on. He would go into the gym to do his recovery or some extra top-ups. Or he would just go to relax by playing basketball - he loved to play basketball.\"",
      "Lammens celebrates against Sunderland. (Image: 2025 Ben Roberts - Danehouse)",
      "Milkon coached in different roles at Club Brugge. He was the assistant of Club NXT (their reserve team), served as their interim manager, was in charge of the Under-18s and eventually became a first-team coach.",
      "His time at Club Brugge coincided with Lammens progressing from the academy to their first team, so he is uniquely positioned to provide insight into United's new goalkeeper signing.",
      "Lammens joined Club Brugge's academy when he was 12. \"He was a guy with huge potential,\" said Milkon. \"As I learned from colleagues who had worked with him when he was much younger, I heard there was a moment that clicked in his head when he became super professional.",
      "\"He was one of the guys during Covid - when the players were not able to train - who was doing a lot at home, he was really going far with this to be the best in these types of areas.",
      "\"Then he continued like this when he joined the first team to train with them. He always wanted to improve. We also had something in place to look at the parameters on which goalkeepers are judged.",
      "\"You see the potential of the goalkeeper based on what they do in games; so their positioning, their decision-making and so on, and Senne was always quite high in these areas.",
      "\"The only bad luck that he had was that the first-team goalkeeper was Simon Mignolet. He's an amazing goalkeeper, so it was difficult for Senne to stay over there in the role of No.2.",
      "\"That would have also blocked his growth, so it was good for him in the end to make the step to go to Antwerp and he did a tremendous job there. It was amazing to see how fast he adapted.\"",
      "Milkon pictured during his stint with Club Brugge (he now manages F.C.V. Dender).(Image: )",
      "Milkon continued: \"I think for us at Club Brugge, it was very clear to everyone that Senne was a top goalkeeper. He would have been the perfect fit for Club Brugge to be the No.1.",
      "\"That was not possible because Mignolet was there. But the parameters that we used to judge his performances indicated he was ticking so many boxes already, and he was consistently doing it.",
      "\"There weren't ups and downs with his performances. He was consistently really high and when you compare this to the top goalkeepers, you have a benchmark to say 'Ok, what potential does this guy have?'",
      "\"He had some chances with the first team at Club Brugge and made a mistake, or maybe two, but in the end it was very clear to everyone that he was a top goalkeeper.",
      "\"It was impossible to try to extend his contract because, again, you have Mignolet, and you cannot block a guy like this. You know he has to go out, he has to play, and he will improve even more.\"",
      "When asked about Lammens' strengths, he said: \"I would say that his decision-making was very good. He is very calm, he sees the solutions on the pitch, he has a quick reaction time and understands the balance between risk and reward, and which decisions are the right ones to make.",
      "\"His clean passing is great, his footwork was really good, and he's just an amazing goalkeeper with the shot-stopping. He made some incredible saves back then already. He's quite a complete goalkeeper.",
      "\"But making the right decisions at a very young age, being very mature with this, was really impressive. And the fact that he is good with both feet is another big strength.",
      "\"For me, Senne is a very calm guy and has all the qualities to be a top professional. That was my impression when I first met him when he was younger and he never changed.\"",
      "A baby-faced Lammens playing for Club Brugge in 2021. (Image: 2021 BSR Agency)",
      "Lammens joined Royal Antwerp on a free transfer in the summer of 2023. He was handed his debut a few months later and served as an understudy that season, but earned first-choice status for 2024/2025.",
      "His performances drew attention from the Belgian media. Lammens saved four penalties across a successful first full campaign and received a call-up to Belgium's senior squad in March.",
      "Milkon said: \"I was not surprised when I saw Manchester United had come calling. And to record his first clean sheet, I was really happy for him. Senne is a potential No.1 for the Red Devils - the Belgium national team.",
      "\"He got his chance, he took it, and we're all really proud of him, but we knew it would happen. I believe he has all the capabilities to become the best in the world, so I wish him all the best. I'm sure he will have a very good career in England, and Manchester United should return to the big club they used to be.",
      "\"He will have a positive impact on that, for sure, and hopefully he will be Belgium's first-choice goalkeeper soon. I believe he has the potential, the skillset and the personality to do that.",
      "\"For me, it was just having a tiny little part in having an influence on him at Brugge, but it was the most positive memories of our relationship that we had during this spell.",
      "\"I'm very proud that he is reaching these high levels and not surprised. I believe he will be successful because he is a guy who will not change his focus or start to do something different. He is calm, that's his personality and character, and he wants to succeed. He is hungry and will keep working to be his best.",
      "\"He is so calm, and you have to be patient in football. You cannot worry too much and want things too early, but finding the balance between not being impatient and, at the same time, pushing and demanding what you deserve in a good way, means everything will sort itself out.\"",
      "Lammens in action for Royal Antwerp in 2024. (Image: Photonews 2024)",
      "United staff who have worked with Lammens at Carrington have echoed Milkon's sentiments. He has been described as \"really mature for his age\" and is said to have taken the move in his stride.",
      "Lammens is understood to have impressed coaches during training sessions and a United source said that lots of people have been speaking positively about him. He has already relocated from the luxury hotel where he was initially staying and into a house.",
      "It's no surprise that Lammens likes to play basketball at 6ft 3in, but he is a keen golfer, which is common ground with the likes of Tom Heaton, Luke Shaw, Mason Mount and Harry Maguire.",
      "Matthijs de Ligt, Amad, Maguire and Shaw jogged straight to Lammens to congratulate him after full-time against Sunderland. \"Are you Schmeichel in disguise?\" was chanted at Lammens from the Stretford End.",
      "It remains to be seen whether Lammens will start against Liverpool on Sunday, but it would be a surprise to see him on the bench after delivering a strong debut before the international break.",
      "There would be nothing boring about keeping another clean sheet - this time at Anfield.",
      "Kitbag has slashed the price of Man United kits and merch with up to 50% off select items.",

Solskjaer and Carrick have both held remote talks, but Manchester United insistent on formal and in-person interviews.",

      "He impressed during his first stint, winning 14 of his 19 games in charge before being handed the job permanently.",

      "“When he [Amorim] reverted to his back 3 against Wolves, who are struggling in form, that was an alarming and concerning development. There were conversations had between all the powerbrokers at United,” Whitwell said on the Talk of the Devils podcast.",
      "“It came ahead at the Friday meeting where Wilcox put points to him, one being that players weren’t on the same wavelength as Amorim and Amorim did not react well to that.”",
      "Whitwell has also shed light on when Ratcliffe’s relationship with Amorim began to change.",
      "“Omar Berrarda was a big advocate for Ruben Amorim coming in, Sir Jim Ratcliffe as well. Ratcliffe had a long, good conversation with Amorim early in the process and was backing him throughout, even when Amorim was questioning his own status,” he continued.",
      "“Ratcliffe started having opinions shall we say about United playing a back four and this is when Jason Wilcox became more forceful in his conversations on that basis.",

      "Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and Michael Carrick have been named as the leading targets to be short-term replacements for Ruben Amorim at Man Utd.",
      "In the summer, Man Utd will bring in a long-term successor to oversee a significant rebuild, with it reported that Glasner, who is due to become a free agent at the end of this season, is a leading contender.",

      "“He has always done that, but he wouldn’t be given the chance to do that at Man United. He wants to get involved and he has a lot of opinions. He wants a final say and the manager at Man United is being controlled by a puppet master.",
      "“He has won two trophies at Crystal Palace and brought them into European football. He gave the club something they never had. He added a new style to the football club, but Man United are not ready for him.",
      "“I think he would have a go at a lot of players who wouldn’t like to work under him. He would tell them what is right and wrong, because he is very strong minded. He is still my number one choice, but I would be seriously worried. Not because of him but because of the club.”",
      "Former England boss Gareth Southgate has also been linked with Man Utd, but Parker reckons he would be a “terrible solution”.",
      "“If Gareth Southgate’s name gets mentioned, it will only be because he is a yes-man. Actually, that could be a very good reason why they would hire him,” Parker added.",

      "The ‘completely scraps management return plan’ bit is also wonderful nonsense. The story is basically that Solskjaer had no intention of returning to coaching until actual Manchester United contrived to manufacture a situation of such absurd panic that he became a candidate to take over again.",
      "In short, the bloke who accidentally became Manchester United manager for almost three years having previously been in charge of only Molde and Cardiff, and whose only role since ended in his being sacked by Besiktas after seven months in August, was not contemplating managing any time soon until a job he would otherwise never be considered for somehow came back into his orbit.",

      "According to reports, Manchester United have ‘tabled an offer’ for Liverpool target Yan Diomande, though a transfer hinges on one ‘huge’ condition.",
      "The RB Leipzig sensation is being linked with several European giants as he is enjoying a breakout season for the Bundesliga outfit this term.",
      "Manchester United are among those linked with Diomande, as they are said to be keen on further strengthening their attack this year.",
      "In the summer, the Red Devils focused on overhauling their attack as they spent over £200m to sign Benjamin Sesko, Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha.",
      "Sesko has struggled, but Mbeumo and Cunha have made a huge impact as the club has swiftly become overly reliant on the two forwards.",
      "READ: Big Weekend: Man United v Brighton, Thomas Frank, Chelsea, Gabriel Jesus, Saudi Clasico",
      "Caught Offside has provided an update on Diomande’s situation, claiming Man Utd have already ‘tabled an offer’ for the RB Leipzig star.",
      "However, the report has explained why a January move is unlikely as RB Leipzig insist on receiving 100 million euros (£86m) for their prized asset.",
      "The report claims:",
      "‘Sources have informed CaughtOffside that Liverpool, Manchester City, and Tottenham from the Premier League, Bayern Munich in Germany, PSG in France and Barcelona in Spain are all “closely monitoring” the player. The market mood points to “summer, not January,” with Leipzig expected to keep the door shut until bids near the €100m mark arrive later in the year.",
      "‘United have already moved forward, with reports suggesting talks over a five‑plus‑one‑year deal worth around €3.5m per season. Leipzig have allowed discussions despite their stance against a January sale. Still, the picture is clear: unless a huge bid lands now, Diomande’s future battle will be fought in the summer among Europe’s biggest clubs.’",
      "Exits could raise funds for signings this season, with Bruno Fernandes linked with a move to the Saudi Pro League after he recently hit out at club chiefs.",
      "Now, Fabrizio Romano has revealed that Ruben Amorim played a “crucial” role in keeping Fernandes in the summer.",
      "“On Bruno Fernandes, Ruben Amorim was crucial last summer in convincing him to stay when Saudi proposals arrived, including from Al-Hilal. Amorim pushed strongly for Bruno to remain part of the project,” Romano said on his YouTube channel.",
      "“With Amorim leaving, it does not mean Bruno will leave. Not in January. His focus remains on Manchester United.",
      "“In the summer, ahead of the World Cup, Saudi clubs will return, as they always do, but for now there is no change in Bruno’s position.”",
      "He added: “On Xavi and Manchester United, I’m not aware of any talks or negotiations at this stage.",
      "“Xavi would love to work in the Premier League one day and feels ready for a new chapter, but as of today there is nothing concrete with United.”",

      "It might be a week later than is correct and proper, but it’s still FA Cup third-round weekend and one could, if one were so inclined, spend pretty much the entire weekend watching nothing but football.",
      "Via the combination of vast swathes of televised cup games, and the Women’s Super League, and the Football League, and the assorted European leagues now back in full swing, and AFCON and assorted international youth action, you really are pretty much set.",
      "There’s even the A-League for the night owls who want something to watch at ungodly hours now the Ashes is, mercifully, over.",
      "It is, inevitably though, the FA Cup that dominates our thoughts.",
      "",
      "Who knows who will actually be in the dugout for Manchester United by the time Sunday afternoon rolls around, but it’s probably going to be a former United man who played under Sir Alex Ferguson, because remaining in deep and perpetual thrall to the Cult of Ferg has gone so well up to now.",
      "Will it be Darren Fletcher? Ole Gunnar Solskjaer? Michael Carrick? Solskjaer and Carrick? All bloody three of them and maybe Steve Bruce as well because why not? Who knows. Certainly not us, that’s for sure.",
      "What we do know is that this is a choppy little fixture for Man United and whichever of Fergie’s disciples happen(s) to be in charge on the day. Having gone out of the Carabao at the earliest possible opportunity via that infamous disaster at Grimsby and having failed to qualify for Europe after the even more embarrassing act of losing an actual final to actual Spurs, United now face the very real prospect of the smallest possible season.",
      "That comes with some perks, of course, but is just not really the done thing when This Is Manchester United Football Club We’re Talking About. If they come unstuck against draw specialists Brighton at Old Trafford this weekend – and United’s win over the Seagulls this season snapped a three-game losing home streak against them – it’ll be a potless 40-game season for a once proud club.",
      "What is left of the season will be spent on a probably unsuccessful bid to achieve Champions League football under some combination of caretakers and interims. It’s no life, that, is it?",
      "As for Brighton, they join your Evertons and your Villas and your Forests among the more conspicuous remaining trophy-dodgers after last season’s astonishing run of success for others of that ilk like Palace and Newcastle and Spurs.",
      "Feels like we say this every single season and it never ever happens, but the FA Cup surely presents a wonderful opportunity for Brighton to do something genuinely staggering. Especially when they’re so safely ensconced as the most mid-table side in the Premier League’s most mid-table season ever.",
      "If nothing else, the sight of Palace winning it must have stirred something.",
      "",
      "From one chaotic Big Six club to another as Chelsea begin their new project under Liam Rosenior having used all their expert boardroom negotiating skills to lure him away from Strasbourg. What a coup that is, by the way.",
      "Rosenior was in the directors’ box to watch Calum McFarlane’s side slip to a pretty ropey 2-1 defeat at Fulham in midweek, but now starts life on his shiny new six-year (stop laughing, please) contract with a short trip to Charlton.",
      "It’s been 19 years since Chelsea last played Charlton, and the winning goal that day came from a certain Frank Lampard which just keeps the whole manager narrative ticking along nicely.",
      "Fair to say this looks like the easier of the two early cup dates on Rosenior’s immediate to-do list, with Arsenal up next in the Carabao Cup semi-final first leg. It’s a relatively gentle start that clearly comes with only one acceptable outcome.",
      "That makes it all the more exciting, though, and there’s no doubt a certain wild unpredictability crept into Chelsea’s football during the final weeks of Enzo Maresca’s increasingly curious tenure and even across McFarlane’s two games.",
      "Even harder to predict what on earth Chelsea might serve up here under a new manager with so little experience of his new level, but the fact it feels roughly equally plausible for Chelsea to go full banana skin as it does for them to win 8-0 or something suggests it should be worth tuning in.",
      "",
      "We’re assuming he starts for Arsenal at Portsmouth with Viktor Gyokeres back in the XI for the Chelsea Carabao semi-final clash in midweek, but honestly who knows now? If we’re wrong, just imagine we put Gyokeres here instead.",
      "It will be a big chance for whoever gets the start anyway, with Gyokeres’ already much-discussed disappearing act in several games reaching new lows in an eight-touch effort in the pouring rain of the very dampest 0-0 squib against Liverpool.",
      "Jesus came on late in the second half and certainly helped liven things up, having Arsenal’s first attempt on goal of the second half just as the clock ticked past 90 minutes and into injury time.",
      "One imagines that chances will be slightly more forthcoming for whoever is in at Portsmouth as Arsenal embark upon the fourth prong of what is quite probably only now days away from being considered a genuine quadruple tilt even though quadruple tilts by English teams absolutely never, ever amount to anything.",
      "To be honest, Arsenal’s best bet might be to get knocked out of this and just win the other three rather than risk spreading themselves too thinly. But are they willing to listen to such good advice and simply win the Premier League, Champions League and Carabao or like Icarus will they fly too close to the sun and chase the impossible?",
      "",
      "It’s all about optics, isn’t it? The photos of Thomas Frank wandering gormlessly around Bournemouth looking gormless with a little Arsenal-branded coffee cup in his hand already have a Steve McClaren wally-with-the-brolly quality to them. When – and it is surely now when not if – the axe finally falls on this doomed experiment, those are the pictures that will accompany this story’s telling.",
      "There is a profound Spurs quality to the absurdity of it all, of course. The series of events that leads to it even being possible just feels like something that only happens and could only happen to Spurs.",
      "But also… consider the reverse. Imagine Mikel Arteta was ‘caught’ supping from a Spurs cup. It would all feel very different, wouldn’t it? The memes would all be about ‘drinking Spurs tears’ and such. Even a few short months ago, this daft little incident happening exactly as it now has would have produced many banters about the impressiveness of finding a cup with Arsenal’s name on it. How we’d have laughed.",
      "Point is, it doesn’t really mean anything. It’s all a projection. But a powerful one nevertheless, one that comes to symbolise everything for a manager who arrived as a details man and now can’t even spot a big ol’ Arsenal badge on a little coffee cup.",
      "What actually does matter, we fear, is that Frank has started talking complete b*llocks. Again, pretty understandable that anyone tasked with managing Spurs eventually finds themselves doing so, but it’s not a sign of anything good.",
      "Consider this astonishing guff.",
      "“In a storm, some are building fences and hiding behind it, others are building windmills and getting stronger and getting more energy and learning from it.”",
      "Now that’s the sort of thing you might normally expect to find written on a toilet wall, but written in sh*t. Or worse, on LinkedIn. Or worse still, on a Jake Humphrey podcast.",
      "But here’s the thing that’s even worse than talking like a Jake Humphrey podcast guest – if you can even imagine such a concept. It doesn’t even actually work on its own batsh*t terms.",
      "First of all, if you’re building anything in a storm then you’ve already f*cked it by failing to adequately prepare yourself. Build the windmill before the storm arrives, if anything.",
      "But also… Frank is no windmill-builder. He has spent recent weeks complaining about the fans, repeatedly pointing out that Spurs finished 17th last season as if that is normal or acceptable rather than the specific thing he has been tasked with changing rather than aiming to repeat, and noting that January is a very difficult month.",
      "The storm has arrived and he’s been busy building crappy little fences and drinking Arsenal coffee.",
      "Anyway, on Saturday his dreary Spurs team take on an Aston Villa team that’s already beaten them once at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium this season and will fully expect to do so again. And with that will go the last lingering hope of Spurs enjoying any escape from the drudgery of trying to make sure a bad season doesn’t become a truly catastrophic one.",
      "Barring, of course, a Champions League knockout run of such vanishing unlikelihood as to make the 2019 effort look prosaic.",
      "There is no avoiding the thought that Thomas Frank’s fictitious windmill is about to get all spattered with some more very real sh*t.",
      "",
      "An inevitably reduced League One and Two schedule with cup runs still ongoing all over the shop, but that doesn’t deny us a pretty big game in the keenly-contested League One promotion race as Stockport and Huddersfield – separated by no points but two places in the play-off spots – clash at Edgeley Park.",
      "Stockport have been hit and miss since going out of the FA Cup on penalties to League Two Cambridge, with as many wins as defeats in seven subsequent games while Huddersfield have put a four-match losing run in autumn – including a 2-1 defeat to Stockport at the John Smith’s – behind them but remain too prone to draws despite losing just two of their last 12 league games.",
      "",
      "What better way to round out a weekend full of all manner of cup magic than by tuning into the final of the Spanish Super Cup, which will be played between Barcelona and Real Madrid now the formalities of getting rid of semi-finalists Atletico Madrid and Athletic Club have been taken care of.",
      "Admittedly, you might argue that what would be better would be doing all of the above but watching it happen in Spain rather than Saudi Arabia but there’s not much we can do about that at this time.",
      "",
      "Third plays fourth as these two try desperately to keep up with the ferocious pace currently being set by Man City at the top of the table and all too aware that neither of them have yet shaken off Tottenham in what is for now looking like a four-way battle also involving fallen perennial champions Chelsea for two Champions League spots.",
      "Wrexham embarrassed Nottingham Forest’s extras before the Sean Dyche cavalry helped contribute to a Proper FA Cup blockbuster.",
      "Arsenal flop Viktor Gyokeres has been kindly informed that ‘you don’t get 60 yards of open grass to stampede past lower-league level defenders here’.",
      "Manchester United have been recommended a ‘shock call’ over their next manager after Ole Gunnar Solskjaer took drastic action and made ‘wage demands’.",
      "Viktor Gyokeres and Gabriel Martinelli come in for different criticism after ‘pathetic’ and ‘soft’ Arsenal ‘totally froze’ when Liverpool put on a ‘clinic’.",
      "It is naive to think that in a world increasingly influenced by AI, football will continue to go unaffected. It would certainly be cheaper to ChatGPT it.",
      "Liverpool fans are torn between writing this off as a transition season and seeing this tripe as the beginning of the end for Arne Slot."

When that happens Nuno Espirito Santo will have lost not one but two Premier League jobs within mere months of getting Nottingham Actual Forest into Europe.",
      "It is a wild ride and, at the top/bottom of this particularly vomit-inducing rollercoaster it now appears to be a straight fight between Nuno and the impossibly beleaguered Thomas Frank, whose latest crime is wandering around Bournemouth with a little Arsenal coffee cup in his hands. And – this bit feels important – serving up some of the least watchable football on Premier League record.",
      "Frank, of course, only moved to Spurs in the summer to replace Ange Postecoglou who has already been hired and sacked by Nottingham Forest, while the true lay of the land at big clubs is laid bare by the fact two of the Big Six have binned off managers not for unacceptable results on the pitch but for unacceptable failure to acknowledge infallible wisdom and brilliance of the boardroom suits. It is immensely modern football and there is almost zero chance we’ve seen the last of the managergeddon for the season. Not by a long chalk.",
      "Meanwhile, here are possible replacement managers currently between jobs, and one of whom could, if they’re not careful, accidentally end up manager of Tottenham before the season is out.",

No denying that this season does represent one in which Arteta might completely lose the plot and go entirely off the rails. Or the one where he wins the league by 10 points. Feels like we’re odds-on to get one or the other.",
      "Arsenal emerged duly unscathed, and cashed in on the shift to easier fixtures of their own alongside much tougher ones for Liverpool to take top spot and control in the Premier League.",

Widespread expectation that tougher games would bring Sunderland back down with a bump have thus far proved wide of the mark; there won’t be many teams unhappy at taking four points from two games against Chelsea and Arsenal this season.

      "That run reached 12 wins in 13 Premier League games to lift Villa right through the mid-table slop, then into the top four, and then genuine title contention. And for the first 45 minutes at the Emirates it really did look like they might stick around for much longer.",
      "They didn’t and haven’t. But let’s not pretend that ‘slipping out of likely title contention’ is some kind of catastrophe for Villa. However disappointing that second half collapse was, they ended 2025 in a stunning place.",
      "Five wins in six games have a distinctly winnable Europa League campaign bubbling along nicely, too. An astonishing shift from what felt like an inexorable downward spiral not that long ago.",

      "A 4-1 thumping of Everton followed a simply huge and wildly unexpected win over Manchester City. Had Newcastle lost that, as all pre-interlull indications suggested they would, then the spotlight would have been harsh indeed on Howe and his team. They would at that point find themselves slap bang in the muck of a relegation scrap; instead they have lifted themselves back into the mid-table morass and – with absolutely nobody in there being actually any good at all – have now managed to get themselves right to the very top of it, firmly back into the Champions League equation, via nothing more complicated than three straight wins.",

      "A streaky manager of a streaky team, but he must still be in credit overall given the prognostications of doom when he had to sell pretty much his entire defence in the summer. It’s hurting him and Bournemouth now but they still – for now, just about – remain outside the real relegation scrap and that’s impressive enough on the back of such a challenging summer.",
      "But after an 11-game run without a win, he and Bournemouth desperately needed something to kickstart another of those runs of Champions League form. And sure enough, along came Dr Tottenham with the prescription, and Antoine Semenyo with a wonderful parting gift.",
      "",
      "Might actually have made Wolves… quite good? Certainly a lot less bad, anyway. It is still almost certainly too little, too late, but that’s also not really Rob Edwards’ fault either.",
      "The first win of the season was a cathartic dismantling of a doom-laden West Ham, and it didn’t come out of a clear blue sky either. There had been signs of life even in defeat at Arsenal and Liverpool, before running away giggling from Old Trafford with a point.",
      "After a draw at Everton, it’s now five points from their last three games. That’s a pretty big deal when you’ve only managed two from the previous 18 games, and suddenly Wolves find themselves as close to West Ham as West Ham do to safety.",
      "Stranger things have happened, but admittedly not many. And most of them in the actual Stranger Things. On balance, Wolves would also probably rather believe in a wild conspiracy theory that suggests this current season has actually been entirely fake and that the real ending is yet to be revealed.",

      "Has done more than could ever have been expected given the chaos he walked into. That epic pants-pulling at Anfield and joyful spangling of Tottenham should be enough to buy any manager coming into a relegation-haunted club serious time.",
      "But Mr Marinakis’ lair is never a safe place for any manager to lurk, and there have been a pair of honking defeats against Everton and a weirdly rubbish performance against Brighton as well that will have had one of 2025’s key supervillains twitching over his big red sack button once more.",
      "Looked in very serious trouble when trailing at half-time against West Ham; Forest’s first win in a Premier League game they’d been losing at half-time since 1997 was enormously well timed.",
      "",
      "The hard-nosed yet valid argument persists that Leeds could and perhaps should have taken drastic action in the summer even after their very good week. It would have made Spurs’ decision to sack Europa League-winning Ange Postecoglou look positively kind, Leeds – and Burnley for that matter – might now be better off had they thanked the managers who secured 100 Championship points and got them back into the big time and then sent them on their way.",
      "Farke had a dreadful Premier League record of only six wins and 26 points from his 49 games in charge of Norwich, a team he twice led to promotion from the Championship with 94 and 97 points.",
      "As well as fighting his own record in this competition, Farke faced the added burden of expectation levels very different to those at just about any other club that could possibly find itself promoted into the Premier League in this current era where that represents the most bittersweet of successes.",
      "Defeat at Burnley was honking, but bouncing back to win another six-pointer against West Ham eased the stress significantly before a paddling at Brighton and events elsewhere – including West Ham themselves – left Farke desperately short of immediate cover before a desperately poor show in a six-pointer at Nottingham Forest.",
      "Another painful defeat having gone in front, against Villa this time, saw Leeds drop into the bottom three ahead of a brutal run of games, but that run has gone surprisingly well. The narrow loss to Man City preceded a rare home win against Chelsea and comeback draw against Liverpool.",
      "The question now is whether Leeds and Farke have really hit on something sustainable, or this is merely delaying the inevitable. After the 4-1 win against Crystal Palace and a very decent point at Sunderland, it really does start to look like it might be the latter which has enormous repercussions for both Farke and several other names around him on this list.",
      "Enormously impressive even in heartbreaking defeat at Newcastle in a wild 4-3 that earned instant classic status. Key now is to ensure that it doesn’t throw them off course, because once the initial pain subsides there is no reason why it should.",
      "",
      "Impossible to avoid the conclusion that Slot’s reaction to Liverpool’s mini-crisis becoming actual-crisis was poor. He went Full Klopp with his salty loser behaviour when Manchester United committed the crime of altering their tactics to give themselves the best chance of success against Liverpool, and the headloss continued after another chaotic and unstructured performance led to a 3-2 defeat at Brentford.",
      "Having ticked ‘opposition doing tactics wrong’ off his rattled manager bingo card, he can now add ‘losing his mind over entirely uncontroversial refereeing decisions’ with his response to both the Cody Gakpo non-penalty and Virgil van Dijk penalty at the Gtech.",
      "It has to be a worry for Liverpool that Slot has for the first time in his Anfield career found himself under any kind of pressure after a chastening run of defeats, and has suffered severe and instant headloss as a result.",
      "Funny to think of a manager who’s just beaten Real Madrid in the Champions League being under threat, but defeat at the Etihad was miserable before Nottingham Forest came along and achieved the amusing feat of being the first team to shut Liverpool out in the Premier League at Anfield since Nottingham Forest.",
      "And then there was a new nadir against PSV. That really was very, very bad. West Ham were wonderfully welcoming hosts on Sunday, but to such an inexplicable extent that it’s hard to know just how much to read into Liverpool’s 2-0 win at the London Stadium against opponents who were barely there. Predictably, they were poor in a 1-1 against proper team Sunderland and showed no backbone in the collapse at Leeds United, which was then followed by a distinctly unwelcome MO SALAH BOMBSHELL that does leave things looking distinctly like either he or the manager will have to go.",
      "A run of four consecutive wins cooled the immediate temperatures, but it does all feel extremely precarious. The wins over Spurs and Wolves have lacked any real authority. And then there were careless draws against Leeds and Fulham.",
      "Arsenal next, and a non-zero chance that any repeat of the Etihad capitulation in the face of the only compellingly good team in the league could spell the end.",
      "",
      "Won’t be sacked, obviously, because Palace are absolutely punching with an elite-level manager who is quietly delivering astonishing results in trying circumstances.",
      "But he’s currently among the names being considered by Manchester United for the permanent manager’s job that is set to be available this summer. And that’s before we mention Liverpool and Spurs. He really does deserve a crack at a big job; it’s just a shame really that they are all, in their way, so very silly.",
      "",
      "Decision time for Burnley. There are two options available, and they prompt inevitable questions.",
      "Option one: Burnley decide to really try and beat relegation, and must decide whether they think Parker is the best man for that job.",
      "Option two: Burnley accept their overwhelmingly likely fate, and must decide whether Parker the best man to get them back up again.",
      "Parker’s job prospects likely rest on the decision. Because if it is indeed option two, he has a compelling case. Option one? He’s f*cked.",
      "But the longer he remains in place, the greater the chance that option two is the one. And right now he’s doing just enough to keep the wolves (literal and figurative) from the door.",
      "",
      "There have been good days and bad, and our whole pondering of Frank’s situation at Spurs has been about determining which of the two would eventually win out. The harrowing NLD-PSG-Fulham week was the first time he really did look f*cked.",
      "Spurs were timid and abysmal in the North London Derby, the second big London derby in a row which Frank had approached more in the manner of a League One manager attempting to avoid a paddling in the FA Cup third round than a legitimate rival facing a familiar foe.",
      "There was some encouragement in a 5-3 Champions League defeat at PSG, but even the very fact it’s possible to write the words ‘some encouragement in a 5-3 Champions League defeat’ is in its own way damning.",
      "But at least those two defeats came against what genuinely might be the two best teams in Europe at this time. With all due respect to Fulham and the sterling work of Marco Silva in recent years, they are not one of the two best teams in Europe at this time, and they were still much better than Spurs who torpedoed themselves inside the opening seven minutes to extend their extraordinarily – and in fairness largely pre-Frank – awful home record in the Premier League to three wins in 21 games since an increasingly odd-looking 4-1 win over Aston Villa in November last year.",
      "Frank’s response to the booing of Guglielmo Vicario after his hideous blunder was firmly in the ‘That’s true, but he shouldn’t say it’ category. And the way he went about it was all wrong.",
      "There should have been some acknowledgement that the booing of Vicario, unsavoury and unhelpful as it may have been, did not burst forth from a clear blue sky but instead a bubbling frustration from fans who pay among the highest ticket prices in the country to watch what is now among the worst and least effective football in the country.",
      "To instead label those supporters – and the boos did not come from a tiny minority inside the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium – not real Spurs fans was another gaffe that pushes the manager further towards the exit.",
      "Until that point we’d felt the obvious comparisons between Thomas Frank and Nuno Espirito Santo didn’t quite fit.",
      "But it’s certainly starting to look uncomfortably similar in familiar ways; the small-time approach to big games has not been well received and the fear grows that he just doesn’t understand what this job requires. The fact almost no manager in Premier League history has managed to understand what this job requires is cold comfort at this time.",
      "However, from there Spurs went to Newcastle and got a draw (albeit a ludicrous one) before they had a dominant 2-0 win against Frank’s old club Brentford, which everyone at Spurs sorely needed. It was easily their most convincing Premier League performance since the win at City on matchday two and a result that could have been even more compelling.",
      "They then pretty much secured a Champions League play-off round spot at the very least with a fine 3-0 win over Slavia Prague.",
      "But Spurs are Spurs, so they followed that with the worst performance yet of Frank’s reign in a truly inept and miserable 3-0 defeat at Nottingham Forest.",
      "Bringing Joao Palhinha and Ben Davies on to try and hold on to a 2-0 defeat and not even managing that feels uncomfortably like the infamous Nuno Moment against Manchester United.",
      "Have reached the kind of state where a dreadful home defeat to a very poor Liverpool is being dressed up as ‘signs of encouragement’. In reality, it might have been the worst possible result; still a defeat, yet one that risks extending the increasingly obviously doomed reign of the latest manager to be chewed up and spat out by the country’s most preposterous football club.",
      "The win at Palace was welcome if deeply unconvincing, while the sheer small-timery of a mind-meltingly dull goalless draw at Brentford really might have hurt Frank more than any of the many, many defeats. Or at least we thought that before they somehow contrived to Dr Tottenham their way to a 3-2 defeat at a Bournemouth side on a horrific streak while Frank was holding an Arsenal-branded cup.",
      "That and the fact the winning goal was scored by Antoine Semenyo with his last kick for Bournemouth before toddling off to pass the next two years on Man City’s bench were just the latest reminders that Spurs are a club where ridiculous things happen routinely, and that Frank simply isn’t and never will be capable of dealing with that.",
      "And in a strange way, that’s to his credit. It does look like Spurs are determined to try and muddle through the season with the obviously doomed Frank at the wheel, and in an odd way his immediate future might have more to do with West Ham than Spurs. It really might take signs of life from across the capital and genuine, mortal danger of relegation to rouse the Spurs suits from their current slumbers. Although Cristian Romero has had a go there too.",

      "It’s been quite a year for Nuno. He ended 2024 as our manager of the year; he ended 2025 looking in imminent danger of his second sacking of the season.",
      "Seven points from three games against Newcastle, Burnley and Bournemouth left things looking far comfier than might have been expected for a manager who, when the Magpies took an early lead at the London Stadium, looked to be heading for a second sack of the season long before the Christmas decorations went up.",
      "But quite why Nuno had to be so very Nuno in the way he, on the back of 3-1 and 3-2 wins and a 2-2 draw, decided to approach a home game against a Liverpool team that had just suffered three consecutive three-goal defeats, is puzzling, irritating and, above all, a reminder that he is here as a firefighter and that the marriage to a fanbase with limited patience for drab and functional let’s-not-get-relegated football is merely one of convenience.",
      "Especially as we still await truly compelling evidence that this football won’t, in fact get them relegated. They are in the bottom three and a long, long way adrift of safety after a rotten defeat to Nottingham Forest, who sit just the other side of the trapdoor but now a chasm-like seven points away.",

      "Courtesy of the wonderful FBREF we’ve used the PSxG minus goals allowed metric to rank Premier League goalkeepers. ‘What the f*** is that?’ you might reasonably ask…",
      "Post-shot expected goals is expected goals based on how likely the goalkeeper is to save the shot. When the number of goals they have conceded is subtracted, we are left with the figures below.",
      "FBREF explains that positive numbers suggest better luck or an above-average ability to stop shots.",
      "Including only those who have played five or more games, here’s how the Premier League shot-stoppers are performing this season.",
      "And here’s who was the best goalkeeper in 2024/25.",
      "",
      "Only Martin Dubravka has made more saves than Roefs but he was able to enjoy the Tyne-Wear derby in relative peace. Against no side has he faced fewer than the two shots Newcastle could muster, with another clean sheet at Brighton followed by an astonishing seventh of the season against Manchester City. What a phenomenal signing he has been.",
      "",
      "Verbruggen’s rotten record last season didn’t stop him once again being linked with the likes of Bayern Munich in the summer. In recent weeks, the Dutchman looked more like a goalkeeper who might catch the eye of the big boys after a shakier start to the season, with a positive performance at Manchester City where he conceded one – a penalty – in the face of 1.7 PSxG.",
      "",
      "Henderson fell from the top of this ranking after conceding seven goals to Manchester City and Leeds from a PSxG of 4.9. Which won’t help his slim England prospects. Little he could do to keep out Archie Gray’s header for Spurs from 427 millimetres and then he under-conceded against both Fulham and Newcastle. A clean sheet against Villa was Palace’s first in seven games.",
      "",
      "The England no.1 was a big climber after a superb performance and a clean sheet at Manchester United from a PSxG of 1.8, only to follow it up with a shocker against Newcastle. The clean sheets v Bournemouth and Nottingham Forest were more like it and though the PSxG at Chelsea – two conceded from 1.2 PSxG – doesn’t look great, Pickford was badly exposed by his defence. David Moyes’ back four was more on it against Arsenal, restricting the leaders to just one shot on target before another clean sheet at Burnley in which he had precisely nothing to do. He was far busier against Nottingham Forest, Brentford and, weirdly, Wolves.",
      "",
      "Burnley appear in danger of being cut adrift but things would be worse were it not for their Slovakian stopper. No goalkeeper has made more saves than Dubravka having faced 20 more shots on his goal than anyone else.",
      "",
      "Life is rarely quiet when Martinez has the mitts on. He began the season well, then tailed off quite alarmingly, before finding his form again. But he was rotten against Arsenal, with narrative out of the wazoo.",
      "",
      "Lammens dazzled United fans with some simple competency but the first doubts were raised over the Belgian after Everton’s win at Old Trafford from 0.4 PSxG. Conceding four from Bournemouth’s PSxG of 3.3 was sub-optimal. Questions were asked after Marcus Tavernier’s free-kick which went ‘keeper’s side’ but we would be looking more at the wall set-up than any failure to react to the shot. Arguably, Evanilson’s strike was more saveable. At Villa, Lammens was beaten twice by Morgan Rogers, who United defenders appeared to know nothing of. A clean sheet against Newcastle while finishing behind the weirdest defence United have fielded in years was really quite remarkable.",
      "",
      "The massive Italian has emerged as City’s undisputed No.1 to the shock of no one and the horror of James Trafford. Donnarumma eased himself in to the Premier League and has been making some important saves, like the double against West Ham to stop the Hammers getting back into the game at the Etihad.",
      "",
      "A fine display against Arsenal, conceding once from a PSxG of 2.2, capped a run of a few positive performances from Sanchez that took the Spaniard into the black. And then he conceded three goals from five shots on target at Leeds. He might have been the only Chelsea player happy with a 0-0 v Bournemouth and though he conceded two at Newcastle, Sanchez could do little about either before helping himself to an assist for Joao Pedro’s leveller. Much the busier keeper against Villa, with eight shots on his goal.",
      "",
      "A dire few weeks for the Spurs keeper saw him booed by his own fans after being culpable for Fulham’s second goal, though the Italian is entitled to ask why none of his defenders thought to offer some cover while he went walkies in the corner. Vicario conceded eight goals against Manchester United, Arsenal and Fulham from a combined PSxG of 5.7 but under-conceded in that batsh*t game v Newcastle. He was pretty much untested v Brentford, but respite was brief before a shocker at Forest. Vicario copped it from Spurs supporters again against Liverpool when he conceded two from 1.3 PSxG but you would have to look very hard for reasons to be critical for either of the Reds’ goals. Bournemouth scored three from a PSxG of 1.4.",
      "",
      "Kelleher has been keeping the wrong company towards the foot of this list for most of his first season with the Bees but a couple of penalty saves has helped the Irishman reach a positive number.",
      "",
      "Last season’s joint winner of the Golden Glove award had a wretched few weeks, falling 13 places in this list before settling against Leeds then Liverpool. But Sels was busy again – and beaten twice – against Brighton, making the clean sheet at Wolves a very welcome thing indeed. The battering by Everton, a groin twang, and benching rather less so.",
      "",
      "His England recall was scuppered by a concussion suffered at Brentford and a run of five clean sheets in the first seven games was followed by none in five. Pope had a shocker in the Champions League at Marseille amid calls for Aaron Ramsdale to be given a chance, with another injury giving Eddie Howe no choice but to change keeper for Newcastle’s first away win of the season. Ramsdale hardly made the place his own so Pope returned and basically had nothing to do v Palace.",
      "",
      "Not a number that screams ‘Make me Newcastle No. 1′. Powerless, though, to stop Nick Woltemade’s inadvertent derby decider and beaten all ends up by Reece James’ free-kick from long range. Roy Keane suggested ‘a top goalkeeper’ would save Patrick Dorgu’s winner for Manchester United, which seemed typically harsh.",
      "",
      "Alisson’s return came as a relief after five games out but even he was powerless to stop Liverpool caving against Forest, who scored three from a PSxG of 2.5. The Brazilian wasn’t troubled even slightly by West Ham; Sunderland were a different story. Conceded three goals from five shots on target at Leeds United but kept out the only effort Brighton threw his way and performed pretty much as expected at Spurs. Didn’t make a single save v Fulham.",
      "",
      "Literally no one views Bayindir as a credible No.1, including Ruben Amorim. Since he was dropped for Lammens, United have regained shreds of credibility. Not a coincidence.",
      "",
      "Johnstone hardly disgraced himself when he came in for Jose Sa but anyone keeping goal for Wolves is basically shifting deckchairs on the Titanic.",
      "",
      "Darlow replaced Lucas Perri after the Brazilian sustained an injury and the stand-in’s form kept him in Daniel Farke’s XI. But Spurs and Burnley scoring four goals from an xG of 1.05 was not a good look on Darlow and Perri is back in. Though he’s hardly convincing…",
      "",
      "Raya has barely been tested for much of the season – no keeper has faced fewer shots per 90 – and we questioned whether he had done enough on the rare occasion Arsenal have needed him. Against Brighton and Yankuba Minteh, he certainly did.",
      "",
      "Areola was a big climber after matchday 12 at Bournemouth, moving from 23rd into the black after conceding twice from a PSxG of 4.1. But dipped again, especially after conceding three to Villa from a PSxG of 0.9. It’s hard to be too critical of him for failing to stop a Morgan Rodgers special, but perhaps a deeper start position would have taken out the risk of being bypassed by the dip and offered more reaction time. Little he could do to stop City scoring three. Giving Morgan Gibbs-White a clip late on to concede a penalty against Forest isn’t accounted for here.",
      "",
      "Leno was bouncing back from a poor season by his own high standards with an impressive start to this campaign but defeats at Villa and Bournemouth were expensive for the German when it comes to this particular metric. Clean sheets against Wolves and Sunderland provided a small boost, but conceding once at Tottenham to a PSxG of 0.5 was a small hit. Then he conceded five to Manchester City and two more at Burnley before consecutive clean sheets against Forest and West Ham. Made not a single save v Liverpool.",
      "",
      "Mamardashvili came into the side just as Liverpool had forgotten the basics of defending. There have been goals for which the big Georgian was beaten rather easily so a clean sheet against Villa was much-needed for his confidence. Only to be stitched up by Virgil van Dijk at City, where saving an Erling Haaland penalty couldn’t spare him from falling here.",
      "",
      "The Brazilian has struggled to convince many Leeds fans and Daniel Farke hasn’t been impressed since the New Year, questioning Perri’s contribution against Manchester United and Newcastle. Will be lucky to keep his place after the FA Cup game week.",

      "The feeling remains that Wolves would have sold Sa last summer if they received an acceptable bid. Perhaps they should have been more open to offers. Allowing Leeds to score three from an xG of 0.5 was especially damning. Back now in place of Johnstone and kept a first clean sheet against West Ham in which he literally had zero shots to save.",

      "Roy Keane has called for Eddie Howe to succeed Ruben Amorim at Manchester United, as Gary Neville tells the hierarchy to \"remove the risks\" while citing Thomas Tuchel as the perfect appointment.",
      "Amorim was sacked on January 5 with both Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and Michael Carrick at the forefront of the club's plans to take over on an interim basis, before a permanent successor is named in the summer.",
      "The exit of Amorim, 14 months after he arrived at the club, marked the sixth manager to be dismissed at United since Sir Alex Ferguson left the club, with Neville now calling for the hierarchy to remove any form of risk when they make the final decision on his successor.",
      "The shortlist of candidates in the running to take over permanently in the summer is yet to emerge but Keane has suggested Newcastle United boss Howe could be the perfect blend of experience and calmness to lead the club forward.",
      "\"He's managed seven or 800 games. He's still a young man. I love his calmness. Maybe Man Utd need a little bit of that.",
      "\"We've seen with our previous [appointments], we like people with emotions, but he's got that calmness. The job he's done at Newcastle, Champions League and winning a cup, I'd be happy to see him go in there.\"",
      "The club have been impressed with the current interim, Darren Fletcher, both in terms of how he has conducted himself in the media and around the Carrington training ground, and the rapport he has quickly built up with the squad, many of whom are already well known to him.",
      "However, after overseeing a 2-2 draw with Burnley in his first game as interim, Keane was quick to put any talk of a permanent role for Fletcher leading the senior team to an abrupt end.",
      "\"Do I think Fletch is the man to do it? Absolutely not,\" he added.",
      "\"But he's stepping into do it for a few weeks and a few months. He'll probably win a few games. If they go with Ole [Gunnar Solskjaer], good luck to them. I wish him well.",
      "\"They need to get a top manager in to get a grip of the dressing room.\"",
      "Neville echoed Keane's calls for experience at the helm, insisting the club need to \"remove the risks\" with their next head coach by appointing someone who knows the Premier League, thrives under pressure and has a proven track record of success.",
      "\"For so long, over 12 years, the football has been really poor. If you think about the appointments over that time, Jose Mourinho is the only one who fits the criteria of the club.",

      "Thursday 8 January 2026 10:27, UK",
      "They chanted for Darren Fletcher. They chanted for Ole Gunnar Solskjaer. They chanted for Michael Carrick. Under the lights at Turf Moor, they played four at the back and saw an academy-graduate winger come close to scoring a stunning winner.",
      "Squint a little and Manchester United's players and supporters were beginning to enjoy themselves again even if Jason Wilcox and Omar Berrada did appear rather stoney-faced in the stands. Kobbie Mainoo and Mason Mount as the midfield two. Thirty shots.",
      "The stories are already doing the rounds about how Fletcher has inspired the young players at Old Trafford by showing them videos of Ronaldo and Wayne Rooney. We have been here before, of course, when Solskjaer had a tale for every situation. Fans lap it up.",
      "None of which should really convince United's decision-makers to lurch back to the past for any great length of time. As difficult as it might be after a painful - and now largely pointless - misstep under Ruben Amorim, United still need to look to the future.",
      "Nostalgia is a powerful emotion when you have won the lot but despite the subsequent line in the song claiming that it is never going to stop, United are stuck once again. This can feel like a football club that is happier looking backwards rather than forwards.",
      "For now, every match - every conversation around that match - has become a referendum on this club's path back to glory. United are at another fork in that road. Many seem tired of the attempts to modernise by mimicry. They want to do it their way.",
      "Gary Neville is determined to see the club embrace their DNA and start 'playing the United way' again. Paul Parker thinks that means bringing back Roy Keane. And that is just the former England right-backs. Viv Anderson's views on the matter are unclear.",
      "Then there are the ginger ex-midfielders. Paul Scholes believes Keane's return would be greeted rapturously, comparing it to Cristiano Ronaldo's playing return - which was obviously a huge success. Nicky Butt thinks there needs to be a role for Steve Bruce.",
      "Rio Ferdinand is pleased that Fletcher has been appointed as interim coach - revealing that the former players' WhatsApp group agrees - and is even more delighted that Sir Alex Ferguson was consulted by his compatriot before taking on this temporary role.",
      "The devotion to the cult of Ferguson might seem like harmless deference to an octogenarian legend but it hints at a longing for what is long gone that retains a material influence on what must happen next. United are still searching for that secret sauce.",
      "Perhaps it is to be expected given Ferguson's outsized importance at a club of United's vast stature. Arguably England's biggest club and certainly its best supported, they have nevertheless only won the title under two men since the First World War.",
      "For context, that is the same number as Burnley. It is fewer than the number of different managers who took Chelsea to the Premier League title over a seven-year period in the 2010s. Manchester City managed to win it under three different men in just six years.",
      "The culture at United is different and it is natural that Ferguson's former players look for lessons from their old guru, even if Solskjaer's infamous claim that he did not feel comfortable using his parking space at the training ground was rather stretching it.",
      "The challenge is that replicating him is not quite as easy as instituting the possession principles drilled into kids at Barcelona's La Masia or Ajax's De Toekomst. Ferguson was more malleable, his ideas a moveable feast that shifted to the game's requirements.",
      "The unfortunate truth is that there is no Ferguson coaching school, no thread of an idea passed down to the next generation, just the gut feeling of a great manager. One who showed throughout his long and successful career that he could adapt to the times.",
      "What would Ferguson do now? We do not know. Most likely, it would look as different as Norman Whiteside did to Carlos Tevez, as different as his Aberdeen team to his late-era United, not some facsimile of a system adopted when John Major was in power.",
      "Fresh concepts came via an ever evolving cast of assistants. He played with strike pairings until he didn't. He played 4-4-2 until he didn't. He played open and attacking football until Champions League success demanded a different approach away from home.",
      "The myth at the heart of all this is the idea that Sir Matt Busby and Sir Alex are and were United incarnate, the products of some immaculate conception at The Cliff, rather than the outsiders they were. Both Scots, Busby even played for Man City and Liverpool.",
      "Indeed, Liverpool went through all this too, dragging Sir Kenny Dalglish out of retirement when they lost their way under Roy Hodgson, the title never seeming so far from view. It took the arrival of a man with no ties whatsoever to the city to deliver that prize.",
      "Speaking of Jurgen Klopp, one recalls an awkward conversation with Borussia Dortmund chief Carsten Cramer when it was pointed out that for all his talk of the need for what he likes to call 'Dortmund guys', it was Klopp, a Swabian, who won their last title.",
      "And yet, still the idea is seductive, a comfort to these clubs scrambling to recapture something lost. How else to explain turning to a man sacked by Middlesbrough in June or a man last at Besiktas who was sacked by Manchester United themselves in 2021.",
      "This is familiar ground for both, of course, Carrick and Solskjaer each having stepped in to steady the ailing ship before. Ryan Giggs did so before them. Ruud van Nistelrooy has done so since. Fletcher now joins that list as United try again to work out what comes next.",
      "But this is stasis not progress and it cannot be presented as some great restoration plan destined to Make United Great Again. It is the absence of an idea rather than a return to one, a club so weighed down by its own history that it gives up forging a new future.",
      "By all means, play positive football with a back four and try to bring through young players. This is hardly unique and it is the aim of most clubs in the country, funnily enough. As with Busby and Ferguson, you do not need to be steeped in United's traditions to do it.",
      "That should be obvious. But when you are Manchester United and have won the lot under one man, the temptation to look back can be irresistible. Solskjaer at the wheel? Meet the new boss, same as the old boss. Squint a little and it might even start to make sense.",

      "Newcastle's meeting with Leeds might have gone down as a classic even without the 102nd-minute Harvey Barnes goal that tilted it the way of the hosts. With the Bruno Guimaraes penalty in the 91st minute, Newcastle had already come from behind three times for the first time in the league since 1996. It felt dramatic enough.",
      "But with that swing of his right boot, surrounded by blue-shirted defenders, Barnes secured its place in history. He described it as a \"blur\" after the game and it was a similar experience for those watching. A breathless encounter throughout.",
      "It was a heart-breaking outcome for Leeds, who took a deserved lead through Brenden Aaronson's superb first-half strike and kept putting their noses back in front. Their brave performance, at a ground were so many teams struggle, deserves acclaim.",
      "For the neutral, the end-to-end action of the game was a tonic to some of the stop-start, set-piece-heavy offerings served up in the Premier League this season.",
      "The number of goals could easily have been higher. The woodwork was struck three times. There were goalmouth scrambles, goalkeeper saves, last-ditch defensive interventions galore. It was an occasion to savour, albeit not for Leeds fans.Nick Wright",
      "Liam Rosenior will have seen first-hand a major issue for this Chelsea team: a lack of discipline.",
      "Marc Cucurella's red card was as blatant as they come (whether the foul continued into the penalty area and should have been a spot-kick is another debate).",
      "It was Chelsea's seventh red card across all competitions - that's four more than any other Premier League team. They're just one off their Premier League record of six with almost half a season to go.",
      "Afterwards, caretaker boss Calum McFarlane argued the sending off was not an example of ill-discipline but admitted the flurry of yellow cards which followed it could be looked at.",
      "But while Rosenior has spoken about his desire for intensity from his team, Chelsea have crossed the line too many times this season. And it's costing them. This is the third Premier League game Chelsea have lost after seeing a player sent off and that's before the impact of suspensions through reds and accumulated yellows is analysed.Peter Smith",
      "It's Harry Wilson's world and we're just living in it. \"Right now everything that he touches becomes something magic,\" said his boss Marco Silva, after the Welshman hit Fulham's winner against 10-man Chelsea.",
      "That's nine goal involvements in his past 10 games for Wilson. \"The numbers are top, incredible,\" added the Fulham head coach.",
      "Silva reckons this is Wilson's \"best moment\" of his career and it's hard to argue. Of course there have been other standout moments for him in a Fulham shirt but Silva noted how the pair had a conversation last season to help try to draw out these kind of consistently impactful performances.",
      "\"In terms of maturity, decision-making, more calm in some moments - you don't need 100 per cent speed in everything,\" Silva explained.",
      "Wilson, Silva and Fulham are reaping the rewards now.Peter Smith",
      "\"Because of my career and the teams I've managed, I've been through a lot of these awkward games.\" And Sean Dyche tends to succeed in most of them.",
      "Four consecutive defeats in a row set Nottingham Forest up to be dragged further into the relegation scrap by West Ham. After just 13 minutes, that was their reality.",
      "But Forest kept their cool and crucially made the most of the two big moments that went their way. Dyche's side recognised the lucky escape they had when West Ham's second goal was ruled out for offside at the start of the second half and went on the attack.",
      "Nicolas Dominguez's header soon brought them level before VAR intervened again and gave Morgan Gibbs-White the chance to complete the turnaround from the penalty spot.",
      "Forest had more xG, more shots on target, more touches in the opposition box and more possession. And with Dyche they had more experience in how to grind out a crucial victory in a relegation six-pointer.",
      "\"It's not easy on anybody,\" he concluded. \"The players, overall, have just about deserved it.\"David Richardson",
      "Fans wondered who would fill the void left by Ivan Toney. Bryan Mbeumo and Yoane Wissa stepped up.",
      "When those two left, it was left to Igor Thiago to step up. Having had his early Brentford career derailed with a serious injury, all the eggs were placed into his basket. And what a decision that was.",
      "Five goals in his last two games including a double against Sunderland, has seen the Brazilian write himself into Premier League folklore. His 16 Premier League goals this season is more than any other player from the country has managed previously.",
      "Bearing in mind that it is still the beginning of January, that is some feat for a player who must be thinking about earning a place at the table for the World Cup come the summer.",
      "More importantly for Brentford fans, his goals may leave them sat at the table of European contenders next season, something they wouldn’t have even dreamed of when the inexperienced Keith Andrews replaced the beloved Thomas Frank. He certainly has stepped into the spotlight without a hitch.",
      "All these changes for the Bees in the summer seemed to spell doom. But, football is a funny game, and it has ended up being another boom instead.",
      "When it comes to Panenka penalties, there's a fine line between audacious brilliance and awful execution.",
      "Which side of that line a player falls on ultimately depends on one thing - whether the ball ends up in the back of the net.",
      "A missed penalty is bad, yet a curious rule of this beautiful game we love dictates that a missed Panenka is orders of magnitude worse.",
      "In the case of Sunderland's Enzo Le Fee, not only did he miss a penalty, he compounded it with a Panenka, which happened to be one of the worst seen in the Premier League for some time.",
      "There is a time and place for Panenka - and this wasn't it. Ideally, they should be taken from a position of strength and not, say, when your team is fighting for a second‑half equaliser after being outplayed in the first period.",
      "Yet when tasked with cancelling out Igor Thiago's opener and hauling Sunderland level at the Gtech Community Stadium, Le Fee decided that was the opportune moment to whip it out.",
      "The penalty barely served as catching practice for goalkeeper Caoimhín Kelleher, who nonchalantly gathered to halt Sunderland's second‑half momentum, before Thiago's second and Ehor Yarmoliuk's third extinguished their challenge.Jack Wilkinson",
      "\"I'm not scared of anyone,\"",
      "That's what Mateus Mane said after he scored his second in as many games to rescue a point for Wolves at Everton.",
      "At just 18, he's the light that Wolves have needed in what has been a dark campaign.",
      "His maturity on the ball, whether in decision-making or looking after possession, is that of a forward well beyond his years. His composure was on full display as he took a deft touch to set himself and stroke home his side's leveller.",
      "Liverpool, Old Trafford and now Everton's Hill Dickinson, the England youth international is building a portfolio of impressive displays.",
      "Still just a teenager but it looks like whatever fate lies ahead of Wolves for the rest of this season, the next five months will be silver-lined by Mane.William Bitibiri",
      "Burnley have spent most of this season searching for something, anything, to break their way. Against Manchester United, they finally found it.",
      "This was not a performance built on dominance or territorial control. Far from it. Burnley lost the expected goals battle 0.24 to 2.25, were outshot 30 to seven and managed just nine touches in the Manchester United penalty box across the 90 minutes. Those numbers usually tell a blunt story. Usually they spell defeat.",
      "Instead, they walked off with a 2-2 draw and a sense that maybe the season hasn't completely slipped through their fingers.",
      "Burnley are now 12 matches without a win, a sequence that speaks volumes about the brutal learning curve of life back in the Premier League.",
      "They were outplayed. They were outshot. They were out-chanced. And yet they survived. It is something to build on.Lewis Jones",
      "It was a tale of two halves on the pitch and a tale of two very different moods from the managers in the press conference.",
      "Unai Emery, still seething VAR did not look at a late penalty claim for his side, insisted there were positives to take following the draw. But the frustration in his body language was clear to see.",
      "Villa could have moved clear of Manchester City in second with a win, although it likely would have been undeserved.",
      "Instead, they dropped points to Crystal Palace yet again. If Oliver Glasner could bottle up what he has over his counterpart when they face off against each other, managers across the Premier League would be queuing up.",
      "In the red and blue corner, Glasner was bubbling in his press conference.",
      "His side are in a tough period but despite injuries and absences due to AFCON, as well as transfer rumours surrounding captain Marc Guehi bubbling away, his side battled well and arguably should've come away with more.",
      "Football is unpredictable at the best of times but Palace causing problems and frustration for Villa now seems inevitable.Pat Rowe",

      "Jason Wilcox, the club's director of football, was key in the decision to sack Ruben Amorim, and is leading the search for his successor - both in the short and the long term.",
      "So far, he has held only informal talks with a number of candidates, including the two primary targets for an interim role, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and Michael Carrick. Much has yet to be decided about:",
      "It is clear that United prefer the idea of appointing an interim coaching team for the remainder of this season, to allow a more thorough process of due diligence on the greater number of big names who are more likely to be available in the summer (think Oliver Glasner, Marco Silva, Andoni Iraola, Thomas Tuchel, Mauricio Pochettino, Julian Nagelsmann and Roberto De Zerbi). But the timing of when that interim takes charge is a vital and difficult decision.",

      "Man Utd had a number of players facing an uncertain future before Ruben Amorim's sacking and the change in the dugout raises the prospect of potentially more upheaval while also opening the door for others to fight their way back into the first-team picture at Old Trafford",
      "By Dan Khan & Zinny Boswell",
      "Wednesday 7 January 2026 14:36, UK",
      "Change is afoot at Manchester United after the sacking of Ruben Amorim - but what does it mean for their high-profile players? Here we assess what the future may hold for Kobbie Mainoo, Bruno Fernandes and Marcus Rashford among others.",
      "Few players are expected to be impacted by the exit of Amorim quite as much as the 20-year-old midfielder, who has been on the fringes this season and frustrated with his role under the departed head coach.",
      "Mainoo is one of the few players in the squad yet to start a league game this season and he faced an uncertain future at United because of Amorim's refusal to give him a chance which has been a challenging situation for a player so early in their career.",
      "The academy graduate asked to leave on loan in the summer in search of more playing time ahead of the World Cup but has never communicated a desire for a permanent exit which suggests he wants to stay and fight for his Old Trafford career.",
      "United have no intention of letting Mainoo leave - on loan or in a permanent deal - because there is a widespread desire for him to stay at the club and keep improving. Before Amorim arrived, Mainoo was a key player and scored in the FA Cup final win over Man City.",
      "Amorim insisted he rated Mainoo and put his struggle for minutes down to him competing with captain Bruno Fernandes to play as the more advanced of the two central midfielders in his 3-4-3 formation.",
      "The hope for many fans will be that common sense prevails, and Mainoo is restored to the midfield once he returns from injury. All the noises suggest both player and club want to continue together as long as he gets adequate game-time.",
      "Surely whoever takes over will not persist with the same shape quite so stubbornly as Amorim, which should in theory open the door for Mainoo to reinstate himself in the team. Then it will be up to him to perform.",
      "Amorim was also essentially the driving force behind convincing Fernandes to stay at United in the summer when Al Hilal tried to sign him. The Portuguese has also since revealed he was hurt by the club hierarchy's handling of that situation in the summer.",
      "In an interview with Portuguese media in November, Fernandes said he felt the club bosses wanted to cash in on him but lacked the courage to defy Amorim.",
      "That tallies with what Fernandes told British media in October, but nonetheless the decision to air his unhappiness with his employers so publicly raises questions about the state of their relationship.",
      "If Fernandes still feels unwanted or underappreciated come summer and another offer like the one from Al Hilal materialises there are no guarantees Amorim's successor will have the same ability or desire to convince the captain to stay.",
      "The Portugal international has said he will not talk to anyone about his future until after this summer's World Cup. By then United will hope to have a new permanent head coach. That appointment could be decisive for Fernandes' future.",
      "The 31-year-old's contract at United expires in 2027 and includes the option of an additional year. Fernandes has shown no signs of slowing down in his 30s but clubs tend to be more reluctant to offer long-term extensions to players of his age.",
      "The England international has revived his career on loan at Barcelona this season under Hansi Flick after Amorim exiled him at Old Trafford. That loan agreement includes an option for the Spanish club to sign Rashford for £26m but it remains to be seen if they will use it.",
      "Barcelona are delighted with Rashford's performances but are unlikely to discuss a permanent move until the summer. They still have financial problems and have to consider if the money is there to keep paying his wages in their entirety as well as the transfer fee.",
      "Rashford's future at Barcelona also hinges on what happens to 37-year-old striker Robert Lewandowski at the end of the season when his deal expires. The England forward's ability to play as a No 9 could come into the club's thinking around keeping him.",
      "Despite having more than two years left on his contract, Rashford remains unlikely to have any future at United. It remains to be seen how the player or club bosses might react if the next permanent head coach wanted Rashford back at Old Trafford.",
      "Everything seems to rest on Barcelona. United will hope they don't have to find the forward a new club once the summer transfer window opens with very few sides able to afford his reported £325,000-a-week salary.",
      "Roma are interested in the Netherlands international and have been preparing a proposal to take him on loan with an option to buy this summer but Sky in Italy are reporting that the change in the dugout at Old Trafford has slowed things down.",
      "Any decision over potential exits are expected to be pushed back until United make a decision over the head coach position - whether it be a permanent replacement or an interim until the end of the season - to let them evaluate the squad.",
      "Zirkzee struggled for game-time under Amorim this season and only regained his place in the team due to players being unavailable because of AFCON or due to injury but has remained patient and is seen as a positive influence in the changing room.",
      "Amorim's view that Zirkzee is more suited to being a No 10 than a striker has been one of the key reasons behind his struggles to get into the team with so much competition for those positions.",
      "If the interim head coach sees things differently that could open the door for Zirkzee to play more with Benjamin Sesko, the only out-and-out striker in the squad at Old Trafford, who is yet to nail down that position after a slow start.",
      "The Brazilian became one of Amorim's most trusted players after initially being dropped from the team entirely and with his contract up in the summer there is a lot of uncertainty surrounding his future.",
      "United do not plan to trigger the one-year option in Casemiro's contract because his wages are too high and do not fit into the structure they are trying to implement at Old Trafford.",
      "However, given his importance to Amorim there may have been more of a desire to find a solution and renegotiate his terms if the Portuguese had not been sacked. As things stand, there have been no fresh talks over a new contract.",
      "United's priority this summer is signing at least one top midfielder which is expected to push Casemiro down the pecking order at United and it remains to be seen how happy the 33-year-old would be to stick around to play less and earn less.",
      "Another big factor will be the view of the new permanent head coach on Casemrio. If nothing is agreed until the summer, the timing could see the Brazilian depart as a free agent before Amorim's successor even has a chance to make a call.",
      "Amorim's arrival was supposed to be good news for the Uruguayan given his success working with the Portuguese at Sporting, however it never worked out like that.",
      "Ugarte never regained the trust of his old head coach at Old Trafford and remains a peripheral figure. If things don't turn around for the 24-year-old under the interim in the second half of the campaign, he will have had two disappointing seasons at the club.",
      "That would put his future in further doubt with plenty of speculation already linking him with a potential move to Turkey in January.",
      "With so much upheaval at United this month, there is a realistic chance that Ugarte will get one more chance to prove himself, but it does feel as though time is running out for him.",
      "The 32-year-old centre-back is out of contract in the summer and so far there has been no clarity around what the future holds for him.",
      "Injuries have kept Maguire out for much of the season but he continues to show his worth when fit, most obviously with his winner at Anfield in October.",
      "The former United captain's resilience and leadership made him a valuable member of the squad to Amorim - but there is no telling how his successor will view Maguire.",

      "\"I best speak to Sir Alex.\"",
      "It has been a quick turnaround for the former United midfielder, who has spent the last six months coaching the club's U18s.",
      "After Monday's sacking of former head coach Ruben Amorim, he was asked by United's hierarchy, including director of football Jason Wilcox and chief executive Omar Berrada, to take the first team's training sessions and prepare them for Wednesday, an opportunity Fletcher could not say no to.",
      "\"It was shock, pride, I best speak to Sir Alex [Ferguson] - they're the things that first went into my head.",
      "\"I phone Sir Alex on all the big decisions that I make in general really in football - his words echoed what my thoughts were, that you do what's best for the club and that's always been my intention.",
      "\"It's beyond my wildest dreams that I'd be sitting here leading a Manchester United team. It's been thrown upon me and probably a good thing because I've not had time to think.",
      "\"If it would have been said to me and planned I might have slept on it and things like that, so the fact it's been thrown on me has helped me to react quickly and do things that come naturally. Luckily I know the club, I know the people and I know the players.\"",
      "For Fletcher, he began his affinity with Manchester United at the age of 11. After having an illustrious career as a player winning multiple Premier League titles, a Champions League and FA Cup, he rejoined the club in 2020 and has had several roles since.",
      "Whether that was as part of Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and Ralf Rangnick's coaching staff, becoming a technical director when Erik ten Hag became manager or now coaching in the youth set-up, Fletcher has truly seen it all in recent years but his aim has always been a clear one.",
      "\"It's never been about me,\" Fletcher said.",
      "\"It's always about me giving back, doing the best that I can to help everyone, help the players, club, staff. Help them become better, which ultimately will help Manchester United become better and that's always been my goal and responsibility since being back here.\"",
      "When asked what the mood has been like over the last few days among the first team during training, Fletcher described it as \"mixed\".",
      "It was only Monday morning they saw Amorim leave Carrington before Fletcher took charge. It is also easy to forget with the Amorim sideshow that this is a team who have not played truly well in a long time.",
      "Two wins in their last seven games - with some disappointing performances against the likes of West Ham and Wolves within that - December and January has felt like a tough period for these players with few highs other than a win against Newcastle.",
      "Despite Fletcher knowing many of those in the squad, he has tried his best to speak one-on-one with players he has not come across as much during his return to the club. Two of those included Benjamin Sesko and Senne Lammens.",
      "However, one player he does know well and was particularly close to Amorim is captain Bruno Fernandes. Fletcher thought it was especially vital to take him aside.",
      "\"I've got a great relationship with Bruno and is somebody who I respect massively. He's been unbelievable player for Manchester United and an amazing leader,\" Fletcher said.",
      "\"Like anybody, Bruno was disappointed. He wants to do well for every manager. Bruno has been disappointed when every manager he's worked with left the club and I know him and Ruben had a good relationship.",
      "\"But a bit like me, Bruno knows his responsibility as a captain - to help all the players, to help and do the best for the club. He is a great leader, a great sounding board.\"",
      "Although Fletcher does not know how long he will remain in charge of Manchester United - he admitted those conversations will happen after Wednesday night's game against Burnley.",
      "But regardless, Fletcher aspires to be a head coach one day and he has the opportunity to make a huge impression.",
      "Having sat in many of Amorim's news conferences, it always felt he cared more about the opposition than what his side would do to exploit them.",
      "I asked him after the 1-1 draw with Wolves why he reverted to a back three after a big win against Newcastle just a few days before with a back four, and he told me it was due to wanting to match Wolves with a similar system.",
      "That is not Manchester United.",
      "When it came to playing style, when Fletcher described how he wanted his side to play on Wednesday night, it was refreshing to hear perhaps somewhat cliché but key phrases like \"being positive\" and wanting his side to \"express themselves\".",
      "That is a United side we have not seen in a long time.",
      "Fletcher said: \"Football nowadays, formations are fluid in and out of possession in different phases, that's the way the game is played now. I want to see the players play with enthusiasm, energy and be really positive when they get the ball. Don't hide.",
      "\"That they play as a team, they play with togetherness, they play with spirit and energy of Manchester United - go express yourself and enjoy yourself and go and try and win the game. These are all the things that I'll be expecting from the players.\"",
      "It has been a chaotic week to say the least for those at Manchester United, but it was impressive to see how Fletcher handled his first news conference as a head coach and how he came across when I sat down with him.",
      "Whether it is just a one-time wonder for now or maybe the start of many, United seem to have a custodian of the club who just simply gets it.",

      "Although Wolves are propping up the division, Burnley, according to the data, are actually the worst of the 20 teams.",
      "Their expected goals against numbers show them conceding 2.00 xG per 90, the worst figure in the division - that's a team consistently allowing opponents high-quality chances in dangerous areas. Burnley also sit bottom of the league for xG supremacy, posting a damaging -1.07 per 90. In simple terms, they're being comprehensively outplayed almost every week.",
      "Shot volume reinforces the same message. Burnley face more shots than any other Premier League team and concede more big chances than anyone else. This looks a fantastic opportunity for Manchester United's attackers to flex their muscles and the 7/4 with Sky Bet on them on the -1 handicap market looks an interesting angle to explore."
