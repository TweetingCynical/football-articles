      "The Premier League transfer window may have slammed shut over a week ago, but Manchester United can still complete a few more deals this month to continue shaking up Ruben Amorim's side after a tough 2024/25 season.",
      "Matheus Cunha, Benjamin Sesko and Bryan Mbeumo all made the move to Old Trafford while Rasmus Hojlund headed for the exit, securing a loan to Napoli with the move reportedly set to become permanent if his new side qualify for the Champions League.",
      "There were also late United departures for Antony, Jadon Sancho, Marcus Rashford and Alejandro Garnacho, who were deemed surplus to requirements at the Theatre of Dreams although more loan deals than initially planned were necessary.",
      "While the wait for a new central midfielder continues - with Carlos Baleba still seemingly in the frame with Conor Gallagher and Adam Wharton both potential options also - United are able to take advantage of other transfer windows that remain open across the continent and beyond.",
      "Andre Onana is set to be the most high-profile player to leave, with a move to Trabzonspor on the cards. The Cameroon international is set to agree a season-long loan deal in a bid to secure more first-team football following the arrival of Senne Lammens.",
      "Trabzonspor are expected to foot the bill for Onana's wages - a major boost for United - and the goalkeeper will also enjoy a pay rise thanks to Turkey's 20 per cent tax rate for Super Lig players. Tyrell Malacia could also be jetting off to Turkey.",
      "The Dutch defender's loan move to PSV Eindhoven last season wasn't made permanent and a late transfer move to Spanish side Elche fell through. The 26 year-old has already caught the eye of clubs in Turkey and Saudi Arabia this summer.",
      "The latter's transfer window doesn't close until September 23. Meanwhile, academy player Sam Mather has also attracted interest from Turkey, as well as Germany and Sweden.",
      "United had hoped to secure a permanent move for the 21 year-old, but a loan deal with an obligation to buy could still be on the cards. Other countries where the transfer window is still open and opportunities could arise include Greece (September 12) and Serbia (September 17).",
      "Former United midfielder Nicky Butt has given his verdict on his former club's summer transfer business, with the 'Class of 92' member explaining where he felt the club went wrong.",
      "\"I know Cunha has done really well over the last couple of seasons but I would really like an experienced striker,\" he said.",
      "\"I hope I’m wrong but I really hope they aren’t making the same mistakes with Sesko as they did with Rasmus. A young player coming in with no Premier League experience, it just feels like history repeating itself.",
      "\"Honestly, for what it would have cost, I would have gone and brought in someone like Ollie Watkins, someone to help and pull the young strikers out of a bad patch.\"",
      "\"When young players are just coming into the club, when the onus is on them to score goals, if they’re having a few bad games they have to have the safety net of being pulled out of the firing line. Ollie Watkins, or someone like that, would be who I would have been looking to bring in.\"",

      "Ruben Amorim has been accused of taking a risk that no other Premier League manager would in signing Senne Lammens. The Belgian goalkeeper joined Manchester United on transfer deadline day after completing an £18.2million move from Royal Antwerp.",
      "Former Red Devils No.1 Andre Onana is now set to leave for a season-long loan with Turkish side Trabzonspor following a series of high-profile mistakes. It remains unclear if Lammens will be used as United's starting keeper straight away after Altay Bayindir began the season as Amorim's first-choice shot-stopper.",
      "However, he too has come under scrutiny for his role in Riccardo Calafiori's goal during United's Premier League opening day defeat to Arsenal. Despite the club's existing woes between the sticks, ex-United and Wrexham keeper Ben Foster has warned that Amorim will be making a dangerous decision if he expects 23-year-old Lammens to start games in the top flight.",
      "\"Manchester United have got a kid from the Belgian league, who's never played for the Belgian first team,\" Foster said on his Fozcast podcast.",
      "\"He's played about 60 first-team games in his career and they're expecting this guy to be able to adapt to not only the Premier League, but adapt to Manchester United as well. It just reeks of sticking a band aid [plaster] on it.",
      "\"I wouldn't expect any Premier League team to sign a goalkeeper from the Belgian league who's never played for the national team, not even a newly promoted team, and not as a starter. It's such a risk.\"",
      "Lammens only let in 32 goals across 30 appearances in Belgium's top flight for Royal Antwerp last term, registering seven clean sheets during the season. He also won the division's player of the month award twice, making 173 saves throughout the campaign, and believes he can bring stability to United's leaky defence.",
      "\"I think if you want to be a good goalkeeper, you have to be a rock behind the defence,\" said Lammens. \"They have to trust you and count on you in difficult moments. That is something I take pride in. Of course, I can improve in this because the next level is bigger, but it is one of my attributes that I am proud of and I try to improve.",
      "\"My parents are also really calm and collected, but [I also developed this mentality] from growing up, when I was in the youth team and I thought about the goalkeeper I wanted to become later in life.",
      "\"I think one of the best attributes you can have as a goalkeeper is staying calm under pressure, in any circumstances, even if you make a mistake or something. You just move on and try to give your best to the team.\"",
      "Meanwhile, Real Madrid and Belgium star Thibaut Courtois reckons United have signed a \"huge talent\" in Lammens. Courtois shared his thoughts on the move with Rio Ferdinand, who then relayed the keeper's verdict on his countryman via his YouTube channel.",
      "Ferdinand said: \"He let me know about Lammens because he's a Belgian player, and he was just giving me the heads up as to what he's like.",
      "\"He said he's a huge talent, obviously not experienced yet but he thinks his style will be well-suited to the Premier League as well. That's a recommendation from probably one of the best three goalkeepers in the world, Thibaut Courtois, so I'll take that.\"",

      "Zinedine Zidane is \"secretly preparing\" to take over as France manager, ending long-held rumours about his fit for the Manchester United job. Didier Deschamps is set to bring the curtain down on his highly successful stint as coach of Les Bleus next year, and Zidane is seemingly high in the running to replace him.",
      "Deschamps, 56, confirmed in January he would vacate the national team role after the 2026 World Cup in North America. The former Chelsea and Juventus midfielder has enjoyed a very fruitful run in charge of his nation, leading France to successive World Cup finals and lifting the title in 2018.",
      "Meanwhile, speculation linking Zidane with the United gig has rarely died down in recent years. The Ballon d'Or-winner hasn't held a coaching role since leaving Los Blancos for a second time in 2021, and the Red Devils are yet to be truly satisfied with a coach since Sir Alex Ferguson left 12 years ago.",
      "Zidane, 53, won almost everything on offer as Real Madrid manager, including two league titles, three Champions League medals and two FIFA Club World Cups. That return has made him one of the most desirable free agents on the managerial market, and the persistent concerns over Ruben Amorim means rumours of a move to United, which began during the reign of Erik ten Hag, won't go away.",
      "But L'Equipe reported Zidane had his eyes firmly set on the France hot seat, which will become vacant in less than 12 months. And many French fans may like the idea of having a succession plan in place, particularly when the candidate is a hero to so many in the country.",
      "\"I feel legitimate in the French national team, where I played and spent almost 12, 13, or 14 years as a player,\" Zidane was quoted as saying at an Adidas event in May. \"Of course, it's a dream. I can't wait.",
      "\"There's a coach in charge, there's a team, and you have to respect all that, and that's what we do. I've always respected football and people, so it's not really the right time. But when the time comes, it will be a great pleasure if the opportunity presents itself. I put my career on hold for a while, but I feel fully a coach.\"",
      "Deschamps is a big admirer of Zidane and has spoken highly of his coaching credentials in the past. And it was soon after announcing his departure date that the incumbent poured praise on his compatriot.",
      "\"There is a lot of respect between us,\" he told L'Equipe in early 2025 when asked for his take on the former Real chief potentially succeeding him as manager of France. \"We saw each other last time in the summer of 2023, we should see each other again next summer, for the same reasons.",
      "\"Zizou is a very good candidate, natural and I would add expected. Afterwards, I don't know if he will want to.\"",
      "Many United supporters are still rooting for Amorim and want to see the former Sporting CP coach thrive at Old Trafford. The Red Devils finally got a first win of the season at home to Burnley just prior to the international break, but the nail-biting nature of that injury-time win against promoted opposition doesn't exactly bode well.",
      "Amorim, 40, has been United boss for less than a full year, but his failure to lift the club from an all-time lowest Premier League finish of 15th last term didn't win over many fans. Neither did the club's early exit from this season's EFL Cup after losing to League Two outfit Grimsby.",
      "In many ways, it makes sense Zidane should move his sights onto the international scene after already accomplishing so much in club football. Meanwhile, Amorim's United are taking things one step up at a time and return from the international break on Sunday with a derby showdown away to Manchester City.",

      "Rhodri Giggs has called out the Premier League's decision to snub his brother Ryan Giggs from its shortlist of 2025 inductees into the Hall of Fame. The Premier League has revealed the 15-man list of nominees, of which two will be selected to join the esteemed group.",
      "Manchester United legend Giggs was a glaring omission, with several players with far lesser achievements being selected ahead of the Welshman. It follows a series of off-field controversies that have seemingly overshadowed his glittering career in recent years.",
      "That includes an eight-year affair with his brother Rhodri's wife, Natasha, which came to light in 2011. The affair tore the Giggs family apart as Rhodri and Natasha divorced, although he now insists it's all water under the bridge, even going as far as to say he has profited from it.",
      "Responding to one user on social media, the 48-year-old wrote per GB News earlier this year: \"Mate, it was over 14 years ago and I've got two kids with someone else and made s*** load of money from it.\"",
      "He added: \"I buzz off it. It was 14 years ago and I made about £1million from it. Can't be on X and not expect a little bit of shrapnel coming your way. All part of the fun.\"",
      "While his brother may have moved on, Giggs' reputation doesn't appear to have recovered from this incident, his fling with model Imogen Thomas and his divorce from wife Stacey, which was finalised in 2017.",
      "The former winger, 51, also left his role as Wales manager in 2022 after being arrested on suspicion of assault. He always denied the claims and was cleared in 2023 after his ex-girlfriend Kate Greville withdrew from the trial.",
      "Announcing its latest batch of potential inductees, the Premier League tweeted on Sunday: \"Home of the greats. Two more players will be voted into the Premier League Hall of Fame in 2025...\"",
      "Rhodri expressed his disapproval towards his brother's snub by replying with a compilation of Giggs' heroics at United, along with the caption: \"13 Premier League medals and countless goals and the record number of Premier League assists. #TheShamHallOfFame.\"",
      "While Giggs isn't on the shortlist, several of his former United team-mates are. Patrice Evra and Teddy Sheringham are nominated for the first time, while Gary Neville, Michael Carrick, Nemanja Vidic, Edwin van der Sar and Michael Owen return having been previously shortlisted.",
      "Sol Campbell, Jermain Defoe, Cesc Fabregas, Les Ferdinand, Robbie Fowler, Eden Hazard, David Silva and Yaya Toure complete the list of 2025 nominees. Giggs, who has not returned to management since 2022 but does work as Director of Football at Salford City, played 632 times in the Premier League and holds the top-flight's assist record (162).",
      "He made 963 appearances in all competitions for the Red Devils during his career as a one-club man. And he won the Premier League title on a record 13 separate occasions, as well as four FA Cups, four League Cups and two Champions Leagues.",
      "Fans can vote for who they would like to see join the Hall of Fame on the Premier League website and app until September 15. The results will then be presented to the 24 current Hall of Famers, including Sir Alex Ferguson and Arsene Wenger, who will make the final decision on which two stars will be inducted.",
      "2021: David Beckham, Dennis Bergkamp, Eric Cantona, Thierry Henry, Roy Keane, Frank Lampard, Steven Gerrard, Alan Shearer.",
      "2022: Sergio Agüero, Didier Drogba, Vincent Kompany, Wayne Rooney, Peter Schmeichel, Paul Scholes, Patrick Vieira, Ian Wright.",
      "2023: Sir Alex Ferguson, Arsene Wenger, Tony Adams, Petr Cech, Rio Ferdinand.",
      "2024: Andy Cole, Ashley Cole, John Terry.",

      "Michael Owen has been branded \"disrespectful\" for his comments that riled up his former Manchester United team-mate Ben Foster. The ex-England striker sparked a backlash following his outspoken appearance on the Rio Ferdinand Presents podcast.",
      "Owen claimed that he was a better player than Wayne Rooney when he made his Premier League breakthrough at the age of 17 with Liverpool. He later doubled down on the comparison on social media after highlighting their respective goal-scoring tallies during their early careers.",
      "Rooney diplomatically sidestepped the question when asked for his response on his self-titled BBC show, instead choosing to praise Owen, who he said was a \"very different player\" to himself. However, the former Real Madrid man wasn't done there as he went on to label Harry Kane \"nuts\" for moving to Germany when he was on the verge of becoming the Premier League's record goalscorer.",
      "Ex-United and Wrexham goalkeeper Foster, who played with Owen during the shot-stopper's final season at Old Trafford in 2009-10, has now hit out at his former colleague. He accused him of being ungracious towards six-time European champions Bayern Munich over his comments regarding Kane.",
      "Foster went on to criticise Owen for lacking modesty in comparing his statistics to Rooney's, despite acknowledging his impressive figures.",
      "\"It is a little bit disrespectful, without a doubt,\" Foster said on his Fozcast podcast. \"If you're listening to that as a Bayern Munich fan, you're saying, 'Hang on a minute, Michael, we're one of the biggest football clubs in the world.'",
      "\"I think it's definitely more aimed at the league. If he [Kane] had stayed in England, he would have been very much on his way to breaking that Alan Shearer record. I understand it, but just leave it. You haven't got to come for him, have you?",
      "\"There were a lot of things coming out of that interview, like the comparisons with Wayne Rooney and who was the best at 17 years old. He [Owen] was like nothing you've ever seen before. Don't get me wrong, Wayne Rooney was an absolute beast, but numbers wise, Michael Owen was on a different planet.",
      "\"The only difference is that Wayne Rooney, though, went on and did that in the Premier League for another 12, 13 or 14 years. There's not much modesty there [from Owen] basically. I think with the career that he's had, just enjoy it mate, you've earned it.\"",
      "Owen, now 45, notched up an impressive tally of 222 goals over a 482-game club career, which saw him turn out for Liverpool, Real Madrid, Newcastle, Manchester United and Stoke before hanging up his boots at 32 due to injury woes. He also scored 40 times for England.",
      "Rooney, currently aged 39, made the switch to United from Everton at just 18 and subsequently became their all-time top scorer with 253 goals, clinching five Premier League titles and the Champions League in the process. He also bagged a then-record 53 goals for England",
      "Meanwhile, current record holder Kane, left Tottenham in the summer of 2023 after 19 years at Spurs, switching to Bundesliga giants Bayern. Owen questioned Kane's decision as he had notched 213 Premier League goals for Spurs, and was only 48 away from beating Alan Shearer's haul.",
      "However, he was rewarded in May with his first career trophy as Bayern lifted the Bundesliga title. Kane has since responded to Owen's comments, declaring he is \"very happy\" with his move to Germany.",
      "Speaking ahead of England's clash with Serbia on Tuesday, he said: \"Everyone is entitled to their opinion. I've spent a bit of time with him but don't know him well. Obviously, he is a Premier League great and an England great as well.",
      "\"I'll respect him as a person, but ultimately as he will know, everyone's career is different - everyone's decisions and motivations are different. I know he was insinuating I went just for the trophy, but it was to be at the highest level for as long as possible.",
      "\"I'm really happy in that sense of playing big games, title runs, big Champions League matches, the Club World Cup quarter-final. I feel I'm improving as a player, I'm pushing my limits as a player in terms of goalscoring.\"",
      "Kane added: \"It's hard not to hear things these days, but the decisions are best for me and I'm really happy that I made that decision and very happy at Bayern Munich now.\"",

      "Jadon Sancho has been accused of having little ability in a scathing attack on the England winger from Jamie Carragher. Manchester United star Sancho has joined Aston VIlla on loan after spending last season at Chelsea, also on loan.",
      "The 25-year-old has not played for United since a seven-minute cameo in last season's Community Shield penalty shoot-out defeat to Manchester City. Speaking on The Overlap, YouTuber Adam McKola described Sancho as the club’s ‘worst ever’ signing, with the winger having cost £73million from Borussia Dortmund in 2021. In response, Carragher accused Sancho of lacking any real ability as a player and claimed he has no stand-out qualities that make him a threat on the pitch.",
      "“When you say he’s the worst Man Utd signing because of his ability… I’m not sure there’s much ability there. I think he’s okay but I don’t understand what his thing is. I’ve been critical of Marcus Rashford but if I picture him playing well I can picture his pace and his shooting.",
      "“I don’t know what Sancho’s thing is. Every player has something but I can’t think in my head what he does. I’ve never seen it in my life. I haven’t.”",
      "Sancho was linked with moves to Besiktas, Roma and Juventus, among others, before joining Villa on transfer deadline day. Villa will pay 80 per cent of Sancho’s wages and the winger said he was “inspired” when he discussed the move with Unai Emery.",
      "United legend Paul Scholes thinks that Emery can help Sancho rediscover his best form after Rashford’s encouraging stint in Birmingham last season, but isn’t confident. “Unai Emery might be good for Sancho but I do think it’s a weird signing,” Scholes said.",
      "“Villa Park is a massive pitch and he’s got a lack of pace and a lack of legs. He’s got some brilliance but what’s his real strength? I don’t really know.”",

      "Former Manchester United star Alejandro Garnacho has paid tribute to ex-team-mate Bruno Fernandes with a touching social media post. Garnacho joined Chelsea this summer for £40million after falling out of favour under Red Devils boss Ruben Amorim.",
      "After training on his own for the majority of the summer, the 21-year-old sought pastures new at Stamford Bridge. However, his latest social media post shows he still has great respect for Fernandes.",
      "Taking to Instagram, Garnacho posted a picture of him celebrating with the United captain, writing underneath: \"Thanks for everything you did for me I love you [kiss emoji].\"",
      "The Argentinian endured a rocky final few months at Old Trafford. A breakdown in relations between player and club reached a tipping point after the winger publicly questioned Amorim's decision to bench him for the Europa League final loss to Tottenham Hotspur in May, with Garnacho only coming on in the second half of the 1-0 defeat in Bilbao.",
      "His latest message to Fernandes comes years after the Portuguese star once claimed that Garnacho didn't \"have the best attitude\" when he first broke through from the United academy, demonstrating just how Fernandes helped nurture the young star.",
      "Speaking in November 2022, after Garnacho scored the winning goal in a Europa League group stage game against Real Sociedad, Fernandes told BT Sport: \"He was good but he knows we expect a lot from him. He’s still really young, doing really well.",
      "“At the beginning of the season, he was not at his best. On the [pre-season] tour he did not have the best attitude. That’s why he didn’t get his chance until now. He’s getting his chances because he’s training better, he’s having the correct attitude.\"",
      "However, it seems Garnacho grew into his role in United's first team and upon leaving, not only did he offer a personalised goodbye to Fernandes, but to the club in general. \"Dear Mánchester. After an unforgettable five years, this special chapter in my life now comes to a close,\" he wrote on social media.",
      "\"We have created moments that will stay with me forever, and I’m very grateful for this. To the coaches, staff, and my team-mates, thank you for believing in me. Every time I wore the badge, I gave everything I had.",
      "\"I leave proud of what we achieved together and excited for what’s to come. Wishing the club nothing but success for the future, while I look forward to giving my all in the next chapter of my career.\"",
      "Garnacho has been left out of the Argentina squad for the current international break so Chelsea boss Enzo Maresca will be hoping that he can build his fitness over the next few weeks.",
      "However, those expecting the winger to have an instant impact at Stamford Bridge might have to wait after he missed the bulk of pre-season with United. Although he could be in line for his debut this weekend with Chelsea taking on Brentford away from home on Saturday evening.",
      "Such is his condition at present, speaking after his first training session with the Blues, Garnacho revealed he was already feeling the effects of being back in action. Speaking to a member of the Blues’ media team, he said: “Can’t move my legs now man.\"",

      "Ruben Amorim is “lost” at Manchester United and in danger of being sacked by Christmas, according to ex Premier League star William Gallas.",
      "Amorim has a solitary win from United's first three Premier League games this season and presided over a humiliating EFL Cup exit to League Two Grimsby.",
      "Against the backdrop of last season's 15th-placed finish, United's lowest since relegation in 1973-74, Amorim has found himself under increasing pressure with a poor start this term.",
      "Former Chelsea, Arsenal and Tottenham defender Gallas reckons Amorim is in danger of losing his job before the turn of the year and is running out of time to prove he is the right man to transform United.",
      "“He looks lost,” said Gallas. “I don’t think his body language and manner, his emotional response, gives a great impression to his players and the fans of Manchester United. \"Looking at him, I don’t know if he will make it to Christmas, to be honest, because it feels like United are one defeat or one bad performance away from a crisis.",
      "“Grimsby was a real low point, for United and for Amorim. The job he did at Sporting was magnificent, but managing a club like United in the Premier League is a huge step up. The reality is that United were struggling when he arrived,= and they’re still struggling now. This is supposed to be the season where things change at the club.",
      "“Now, things are still going badly. Maybe it’s too much pressure for the manager and the players. Maybe there are too many big egos in the squad. Where he was before, you can imagine that the Sporting players didn’t have huge ego, so he has to deal with a new management problem.",
      "“The players at Sporting weren’t as good as United, but he could get them to follow him and be more effective. Now he’s got so much pressure on his shoulders, and he looks to be an emotional character.",
      "\"He tried to explain to Kobbie Mainoo that he has to fight for his position. Maybe he doesn’t follow the instructions from his manager, maybe he doesn’t run enough. But instead, Mainoo wanted to leave.”",
      "Gallas, who won 84 caps for France, claimed Amorim is starting to resemble his United predecessor, Erik ten Hag, whose reign unravelled after a run of poor results.",
      "“Right now, Amorim looks like Ten Hag all over again,” said Gallas. “The job is all about results at this point and they lost to Grimsby. That is a shocking, poor result. United have the same problems as any other mid-table side and that’s what they are these days.",
      "\"Sometimes their players lift their games and compete against the best, and they look great. Then they buy players who look good elsewhere, but with the added pressure there is at United, they crumble. Maybe for Amorim, he’s finding the pressure too much himself.”",
      "Gallas also questioned the wisdom of United signing Bryan Mbeumo from Brentford for an initial fee of £65million. “I think the problem is that I find it hard to understand what they did in the transfer window,” said Gallas. “They have Mbeumo, and the player is good enough for most sides, but I don’t know if you can justify that transfer fee. They’ve spent an awful lot of money and not really changed too many of their first-choice XI. We’re always talking about money these days, and I know the prices keep on rising every year, but come on. This seems crazy.”",
      "Gallas was speaking to Gambling Zone. The full interview can be found here.",

      "Nuno Espirito Santo has become the first managerial casualty of the season after he was axed by Nottingham Forest. His departure owing more to a breakdown in relationship with the owner rather than on pitch results.",
      "Nuno's decision to speak publicly about Evangelos Marinakis ultimately cost him despite his impressive exploits at the City Ground. Several other men will be feeling the heat in the midst of the first international break of the season, which follows three Premier League games.",
      "It gives bosses a chance to take stock with some struggles already foreseen. Others, the likes of Manchester City, were not on the horizon. Rarely will a board panic this early and any exits are often because of internal politics, Nottingham Forest a case in point.",
      "It is more likely that in a month changes may begin to be discussed, but poor results now will give a chairman something to think about going forward. Nuno will also be a man looking for a job and has shown how he can outperform resources, which could be senior figures on notice.",
      "We're still so early in the campaign but managers know they do not have long shelf lives in this game and will be aware of how the pressure gauge is building - or not.",
      "We cast our eye over the 19 managers still in a job and discuss how safe their jobs are following their exploits to begin the season and whether they have enough credit in the bank to consider themselves safe.",
      "Arne Slot is a man eyeing back-to-back titles and, after his summer of transfer activity, may well pull it off. His Liverpool team have the only perfect record left in the Premier League and whilst he may not have the charisma of Jurgen Klopp, he could well be held in the same regard soon enough.",
      "His appointment was an inspired choice. He downed Mikel Arteta last time out but the Arsenal board are steadfast in their belief in the Spaniard, hence the investment they've made in his squad. And whilst he's lost two out of three, Pep Guardiola is an unsackable manager.",
      "He will leave Manchester City on his own terms, and ultimately only has another two years on his deal with his legacy in English football already assured.",
      "Several other individuals are secure in their jobs, but the history of some of their hierarchies means they can never totally be calm. Enzo Maresca is building nicely at Chelsea with their decision to pluck him out of the Championship currently paying off.",
      "Thomas Frank moved across London and has largely impressed at Tottenham. He was ultimately Daniel Levy's appointment and the change there means there could be issues, but that seems very unlikely right now. Regis Le Bris at Sunderland has begun their survival bid brilliantly and, bar a mental collapse, looks a safe pair of hands.",
      "David Moyes and Everton have always seemed a good fit and, as they embark on their new era, having the Scot in place seems right. He's also got the players he wants which will certainly help and that has been backed up by the results.",
      "Aston Villa are yet to score a goal this season and don't seem to have the magic of recent years yet, but Unai Emery has led them to such heights that he is almost untouchable at Villa Park. Never say never though. Brighton's Fabian Hurzeler is also a man who has the full backing of the men above him with the Seagulls a very measured outfit.",
      "Eddie Howe is preparing for his second tilt at the Champions League but has a fresh challenge on his hands amid the post-Alexander Isak era. The Newcastle boss has continued to overcome challenges though and looks the perfect fit for right now at St James' Park.",
      "Oliver Glasner and Andoni Iraola are two men who yield huge power at their clubs. Both have allowed them to punch above their weight and, despite Bournemouth losing a chunk of their best players, the Spanish manager has still enjoyed a positive start to the year. Glasner certainly had to fight to keep skipper Marc Guehi at Selhurst Park, but has already masterminded some stellar results - beating Liverpool and Aston Villa - ahead of a European campaign.",
      "The two other promoted sides, Leeds and Burnley, have stuck with their managers. Getting your side into the top flight counts for something, but neither men have glowing records in the Premier League. Reports claimed Daniel Farke's job was under pressure in the summer, but he remains in his post. He and Scott Parker both have a win to their name which will help in the short-term.",
      "Keith Andrews is the new man at Brentford. He's just lost several of his leading lights which has made the Bees some people's tip for the drop, but he'll have the backing of those above him until they have to potentially consider their top flight status.",
      "Marco Silva has been linked with jobs away from Fulham but has underlined his commitment to the cause in west London. It has not been the ideal start to the season, which follows a difficult window, but the way he's established the Cottagers in the Premier League will give him enough credit for now.",
      "Manchester United never seem far from a crisis. Ruben Amorim had to deal with the fallout from the Carabao Cup loss to Grimsby. If it weren't for Ineos being determined to show they can get a managerial appointment right he might already be gone. To be honest his grace period cannot last much longer and he needs results, even if Sir Jim Ratcliffe will be loathed to axe him.",
      "Graham Potter is one man who doesn't have that luxury at West Ham. The win over Nottingham Forest has certainly bought him time, but the manner of some of their early defeats has piled on the pressure. The next few weeks will be crucial if the ex-Chelsea boss wants to rebuild his reputation.",
      "Another man feeling the heat will be Vitor Pereira. Any manager sat bottom without a point will see fingers pointed at him and Wolves know they will be among those fighting for survival.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "It hasn’t taken long for Ange Postecoglou to return to the Premier League, with Nottingham Forest set to appoint the former Tottenham head coach after sacking Nuno Espirito Santo. Postecoglou's arrival at the City Ground is will be confirmed imminently.",
      "That will see him take to the dugout for Forest's visit to Arsenal in the Premier League on Saturday, with Postecoglou to be joined by several of his former Spurs coaching staff. The 60-year-old has been without a job since his bombshell sacking in June.",
      "His dismissal came exactly two years after his Spurs appointment, despite him winning the Europa League. But the Australian was not short of options as he mulled over his next managerial role over the summer.",
      "According to reports, he rejected a job offer from Saudi Arabia's Al-Ahli and Turkish giants Fenerbahce. The Super Lig side recently sacked Jose Mourinho after just over a year in charge due to club bosses wanting “better football.”",
      "The Istanbul club were understood to have held talks with Postecoglou, as well as former Italian national team boss Luciano Spalletti, who also declined the offer. That is because Postecoglou wanted another crack at the Premier League.",
      "Fox Sports News’ Robbie Slater had said: “He wants to go back to England, I know that. Graham Arnold met up with him recently, and had a great conversation with him, and he wants to go back to the Premier League. We know Tottenham didn’t have a great season in respect to their Premier League position, 17th. But they did win the Europa League, that’s a big thing.”",
      "The former Spurs head coach was lined up as a candidate for Forest following Nuno’s departure after his rift with Forest owner Evangelos Marinakis and new global head of football Edu.",
      "The Portuguese risked the Greek businessman’s wrath when he went public about their souring relationship. And a 3-0 loss to West Ham proved the final nail in the coffin, despite Nuno’s success in Nottingham, having already had a high-profile argument on the sidelines with Marinakis after a game late last season.",
      "Being appointed as Forest boss will give Postecoglou the chance to compete in the Europa League again. And Forest’s highly-divisive owner has made no secret of his admiration for the Greek-born tactician. While presenting Postecoglou with an award earlier this year in Greece, he said: “What I want to say about Ange is that he has spoken about Greece many times, he is proud to be Greek and in the great success he had with Tottenham by winning the Europa League, he spoke about Greece.",
      "“A man who not only does not hide his origin but is also proud of it. What he achieved, he did with a team that has not won any titles, it has had a very difficult time in recent years. In this huge success that the whole world saw, he promoted Greece. We must thank him especially for this and we wish him well, although we are sure that he will do well as he has the ability. Wherever he goes, the successes will come.”",
      "Despite Forest having been his likeliest destination all along, Manchester United had also been described as an option for him. That first required Ruben Amorim to depart the club after a hugely difficult start to the season, despite spending heavily on new signings in an effort to change their fortunes.",
      "“When you look at it, I wouldn’t rule out Manchester United the way things are going with Amorim,\" Slater had told Fox Sports. “I think those three clubs, United, West Ham, Forest look dodgy in respect to their managers.\"",
      "However, despite Postecoglou coming out on top when he faced Amorim in the Europa League final, the Australian’s poor domestic season was what led to his Spurs sacking, and was unlikely to have filled the Red Devils hierarchy with confidence given his Spurs side finished even lower than their worst ever Premier League campaign.",
      "Postecoglou was also linked with the West Ham job, though Graham Potter appears to have saved his skin with a win over Forest to lift the Hammers off the bottom of the table.",
      "There is a chance that a return to poor results after the international break may prove to be the tipping point and potentially lead to the Englishman’s sacking, though Postecoglou will no longer be waiting in the wings.",

      "Dwight Yorke has spoken out in defence of Alexander Isak, stressing that the striker has not done anything new or underhand in wanting to pursue a blockbuster transfer to Liverpool by citing his own experience in pushing for a move to Manchester United.",
      "Isak, 25, made it clear that he wished to pursue a move to the Premier League champions, only for Newcastle to dig their heels in over their star striker. Isak responded by effectively downing tools and did not feature in Newcastle's opening games of the season before they relented and sanctioned a £125million exit in the final hours of the summer transfer window.",
      "The Sweden international's behaviour in the build-up to the move has been condemned by fans and pundits alike, while Newcastle marked his departure with a blunt 37-word statement.",
      "But Yorke, who got his wish when Manchester United came calling back in his Aston Villa days, says only people who have been in a similar situation will understand what Isak went through this summer - and that the drama is not really anything new. “If you've been in his position, you could understand. I certainly have with my transfer from Aston Villa to Manchester United. It never really ends well when a player comes out and says he wants to move. It never really does,” Yorke told Jackpot City Casino.",
      "“What I don't condone is not training, not participating, because ultimately he's still getting paid by the club, and he's still their player. Coming out and wanting to leave to go to a bigger club, it's happened all the time. So I don't understand how all these ex-players are saying all this and that.”",
      "Isak's desire to move on from St James' Park despite the club winning the Carabao Cup last season and qualifying for the Champions League drew the ire of many fans. But Yorke argues that Liverpool are a bigger club and that by moving to Anfield, he now stands a much better chance of landing the game's most lucrative prizes.",
      "“These guys [criticising] probably haven't been in those circumstances,” Yorke added. “But for the ones who have been in those circumstances, they totally get it. So you want to go and play for Liverpool, and no disrespect, Newcastle, Liverpool is a bigger club, and that's what players want. They want to go and play in all these big competitions, want to win major competitions. That's the only reason.",
      "“He's given three years at Newcastle. You've seen Andy Cole made that transition from Newcastle as well. So it's not like it's never happened before. All these players and ex-players and all of those, fans, it's something that is common in the game.",
      "“It's always been there for a number of years. So I don't understand the uproar when someone says he wants to leave because he wants to go to a bigger club. He wouldn't leave the club to go for a lesser club than Newcastle. That conversation wouldn't take place.",
      "“But a bigger club, and that's what big clubs do, they go after players who are going to make their team better. And that's simply the case. So I don't get why it's become such an uproar. It's happened for years.”",

      "The most decorated player in Premier League history, Ryan Giggs is now living a life far removed from his Manchester United glory days.",
      "Once the poster boy and a star whose name was synonymous with Old Trafford glory, Giggs has quietly slipped into the shadows. Giggs, who became a father again last year, is adjusting to parenthood in his fifties while working a low-key job far from the football limelight.",
      "Despite his illustrious playing career, Giggs remains a contentious figure. His glittering playing career is often framed against the backdrop of personal scandals and more recent legal battles, factors which continue to cloud his legacy and no doubt weigh on perceptions at the highest levels of the game - again seeing him snubbed from a nomination from the Premier League hall of fame, making a mockery of that particular accolade.",
      "So, who is Ryan Giggs today? A football legend, a divisive character, a man rebuilding his life away from the public eye - this is the former Wales football manager now....",
      "Giggs' only active role in football today is as director of football at Salford City, the League Two club he used to co-own alongside his Class of '92 team-mates before a takeover in May of this year. A new ownership consortium, spearheaded by Gary Neville and David Beckham, bought the club from the original Class of '92 shareholders and the previous majority shareholder, Peter Lim.",
      "Although Giggs' director of football role was never officially confirmed, he has become a familiar figure on the touchline in recent months, collaborating closely with boss Karl Robinson, who has hailed his input as \"outstanding\".",
      "The 10 percent shareholding he purchased in Salford back in 2014 has essentially provided him with a pathway back into football following his departure from Wales and the subsequent legal proceedings. In-house club interviews and a Sky documentary showed him helping on the training pitch and advising behind the scenes, while his profile was raised further when Salford faced Manchester City in the FA Cup.",
      "For now, the role keeps him tethered to football in a meaningful way. But compared to his glittering career at Manchester United and his time as Wales manager, being confined to Salford underlines just how far outside the mainstream Giggs now finds himself.",
      "All this comes two years after domestic abuse charges against him were dropped. He was found not guilty after his ex-girlfriend, Kate Greville, declined to give evidence in a retrial and Giggs, who denied the charges, then set about rebuilding his career.",
      "When speaking about management and a potential return to the dugout, he said: \"I loved managing Wales, obviously. I do miss it, so hopefully.\"",
      "Giggs welcomed another child at the age of 50 after his girlfriend Zara Charles gave birth to their first child together. The couple welcomed a daughter, named Cora, on November 1 last year.",
      "A spokesperson for the former Manchester United star confirmed: \"Ryan and his partner Zara are delighted to announce the birth of their daughter, Cora Giggs, who was born on Friday 1 November. They extend their warmest gratitude to all the amazing staff, especially the midwives, at Wythenshawe Hospital.\"",
      "Cora became Giggs' third child. He's already father to two youngsters – Zach, 18, a footballer with Sheffield United and Wales youth, and Libby, 22 – from his marriage to Stacey Cooke.",

      "Despite all his triumphs on the pitch, Giggs' business endeavours away from football have proved far less lasting.",
      "In 2014 he teamed up with school mates Kelvin Gregory and Bernie Taylor to launch George's Dining Room and Bar in Worsley, the Manchester suburb where he was raised. Marketed as a \"lifelong dream\" for the three locals, it became a beloved establishment for nearly a decade.",

A handwritten sign in the window confirmed the doors would remain shut. Staff were told they would receive what they were owed, but many described the announcement as completely unexpected.",
      "The shutdown brought an end to a personal venture Giggs had hoped would establish Worsley as a culinary hotspot. It also highlighted the challenges even famous names encounter when venturing beyond football.",
      "Giggs has been ignored once more for the Premier League Hall of Fame this week, despite being the league's most successful player with 13 championship wins and a record 162 assists.",
      "Since the Hall of Fame launched in 2021, Giggs has never received a nomination, whilst numerous former Manchester United colleagues – including Gary Neville, Paul Scholes, Rio Ferdinand and Wayne Rooney – have already gained entry.",
      "This year's candidates feature another strong former Manchester United presence. Patrice Evra and Teddy Sheringham have earned their first nominations, alongside Gary Neville, Michael Carrick, Nemanja Vidic, Edwin van der Sar and Michael Owen, who have all appeared on previous shortlists. Ex-Chelsea stars Eden Hazard and Cesc Fabregas also feature amongst the nominees.",
      "2021 inductees: David Beckham, Dennis Bergkamp, Eric Cantona, Thierry Henry, Roy Keane, Frank Lampard, Steven Gerrard and Alan Shearer.",
      "2022: Sergio Agüero, Didier Drogba, Vincent Kompany, Wayne Rooney, Peter Schmeichel, Paul Scholes, Patrick Vieira and Ian Wright.",

      "West Ham were once forced to replay a League Cup tie for fielding an ineligible player – unlike Grimsby Town, who were given a reprieve for a similar offence. The Mariners famously beat Manchester United 12-11 in a penalty shoot-out last month, having led 2-0 in normal time before being pegged back.",
      "Soon after, it emerged that Clarke Oduor, who came on as a 73rd-minute substitute and missed a penalty in the shootout, was not technically eligible for the second round tie. A loan signing from Bradford City, the Kenyan’s registration was submitted at 12.01pm on the day before the match, shortly after the 12pm deadline.",
      "The League Two club have been fined £20,000, with £10,000 suspended until the end of the season. Grimsby self-reported the breach once they discovered the error the day after the match.",
      "The mistake has led to calls for the match to be replayed or for Grimsby to be thrown out of the competition. However, the EFL said the fine was issued following precedent after a review of the evidence and consideration of prior decisions regarding offences in the competition. Recent examples of teams fielding ineligible players have indeed resulted in fines rather than expulsions or replays.",
      "However, that didn’t apply in 1999 when the Hammers were ordered to replay their quarter-final against Aston Villa after the cup-tied Emmanuel Omoyinmi came off the bench in the final stages before the tie went to penalties.",
      "Omoyinmi had played in both legs of Gillingham’s second round encounter with Bolton Wanderers and was therefore ineligible to play for another club in that season’s competition. West Ham ’s shoot-out victory was declared void, with Villa winning the replayed match in extra time.",
      "The circumstances around Grimsby’s error are very different. The Mariners, who will visit Sheffield Wednesday in round three, released a statement acknowledging the sanction, revealing the delay in meeting the deadline had been due to a computer problem.",
      "“We accept the fine imposed and fully recognise the importance of adhering to competition rules and regulations,” the club said. “This mistake was not deliberate, and the club acted transparently by self-reporting the breach as soon as it came to light.”",
      "Grimsby boss David Artell said: “What happens surrounding that isn't in my domain but nobody can take away the performance of the players and the manner of the victory, certainly not in my eyes anyway.",
      "“What happened was unfortunate. We owned up, made a statement, let everyone know and we move on.”",
      "United, the 2023 winners, have not appealed to be reinstated and have declined to comment publicly on the matter.",

      "Rio Ferdinand is glad to see the back of Andre Onana at Manchester United, having “suffered” him over the past year. Onana is leaving United for a season-long loan with Turkish side Trabzonspor following the arrival of Senne Lammens in the summer transfer window.",
      "Onana has been the first-choice goalkeeper since moving to Old Trafford from Inter Milan in 2023. But his shaky performances saw Altay Bayindir take the No.1 role this season before Lammens arrived in a £18million move from Royal Antwerp on transfer deadline day.",
      "The former Ajax goalkeeper, who was signed by Erik ten Hag, has therefore agreed to join Trabzonspor for the 2025/26 campaign. United will not receive a loan fee, while the Turkish side won’t have the chance to sign the Cameroon international permanently either.",
      "But, speaking on Rio Ferdinand Presents, former United defender Ferdinand is happy that the club have found a solution. “I think [Omar Berrada], who is running the football operations at the club, I think he's made the point that they're not going to have players sitting around that are not worthy of being at the football club anymore,” he said.",
      "“They're not going to have players that either aren't good enough, haven't performed well enough or are not the right people to be at the football club. He's not going to have them around like bad smells. I think, for far too long, we've had at that at the football club.",
      "“We've been forced to keep players because of bad financial situations that the club have put us in with players and we've had to keep them here, sit with them and had to suffer some of these players.”",
      "Ruben Amorim began the summer by creating a ‘bomb squad’ of unwanted players, which included Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho, Antony, Alejandro Garnacho and Tyrell Malacia. United did eventually manage to offload all of those players, except Malacia, while Rasmus Hojlund, Victor Lindelof and Christian Eriksen also left the club.",
      "The bomb squad approach was controversial at United, but Ferdinand ultimately feels it has been vindicated. “I think this is a step in the right direction,” Ferdinand added. “As happy as I am with the players that are coming in and providing a difference in terms of speed, dynamism, pace and goal threat, I'm as pleased, if not more, with the way they've got players out that the club deemed weren't right to be there.",
      "“That side of it has been as important, if not more, than the incoming players because I think it sends out a fantastic message and a strong message to the players that are there: you ain't hanging about here if you ain't what we want.",
      "“That's what it should be like at every club. If you're not right for the football club, you've got to get out. That's why I'm so strong on it when a player wants to go, he should be able to force and go, ‘I think it should work both ways’.”",

      "Brighton star Carlos Baleba was reportedly 'very open' to a move to Manchester United even though the midfielder end up not completing a switch to Old Trafford. The Red Devils failed to secure a central midfielder during the transfer window, having been heavily linked with signing Baleba for the majority of the summer.",
      "Ruben Amorim's squad decided to bide their time in their efforts to bolster their midfield with Atletico Madrid star Conor Gallagher mentioned as a potential target. United's aspirations clearly involve securing a deal for Baleba in the future.",
      "The Athletic have reported that personal terms have already been agreed between Baleba and United in anticipation that a move could still happen in the future. Fabrizio Romano also suggests that the player remains a player of interest to United heading into 2026, and the club were pleased to discover that the Brighton star was keen on a move over the summer, despite the lack of European football on offer.",
      "The 21-year-old was notably absent from Cameroon's squad during their victory over Eswatini, a match that saw both Bryan Mbeumo and Andre Onana take to the pitch. Mbeumo, a £71million signing for United this summer, provided an assist in a 3-0 victory for his country.",
      "It remains to be seen what United will have planned for their midfield revamp when the January transfer window opens. It seems unlikely that a move for Baleba could be possible in the middle of the season, and only time will tell if alternative targets emerge on the rumour mill between now and the New Year.",

      "Manchester United goalkeeper Andre Onana has agreed to join Turkish side Trabzonspor on loan for the remainder of the season. And the 29-year-old will leave temporarily knowing he's had the backing of his team-mates through a tricky tenure at Old Trafford.",
      "The Cameroonian arrived from Inter Milan two years ago for £43.8million, and while he has shown glimpses of quality, errors have been plentiful and costly. Last season under Ruben Amorim, Onana came under heavy fire for performances in the Europa League, and added to these criticisms with a calamitous performance during the Red Devils' shock Carabao Cup exit to Grimsby Town last month.",
      "He is now set to join Trabzonspor on a season-long loan in light of United signing Belgian goalkeeper Senne Lammens on deadline day for £18.2m. No fee or option to buy is included, and the move will be sealed once he returns from international duty. Onana says his goodbyes after enduring a difficult spell, but leaves knowing his team-mates have had his back and rate him highly.",
      "In 2024, Onana began building on a dismal first season in the Premier League, which saw him produce costly mistakes in the Champions League. Peer Diogo Dalot was asked about his growth from season one to season two, and replied with praise.",
      "\"At this club, because of the demands and the expectations we have here, it can be really easy for you to fall mentally and to feel really bad,\" stated Dalot. \"I think he found this balance of being really calm and really confident, and I think it shows on the pitch that he is really good.\"",
      "However, errors would return to the goalkeeper's game, and in December, he cost his club in back-to-back matches. After a questionable performance against Nottingham Forest, in which a long-range Morgan Gibbs-White strike was dealt with poorly, Onana made headlines for a Europa League error days later.",
      "Early in United's clash with Viktoria Plzen, Onana sold defender Matthijs de Ligt short with a pass and allowed United's opponents to open the scoring. The Red Devils did win 2-1, though captain Bruno Fernandes backed his shot-stopper after the full-time whistle.",
      "\"We have huge belief in Andre,\" said Fernandes. \"He knows he made a mistake, he's a clever guy. We don't need to tell him. He's going to help many times coming out from the back. We trust his qualities on the ball.\"",
      "The mistakes did not stop there. Roughly four months later, Onana would face intense scrutiny for a host of errors when United tackled Lyon in the same competition. During the first leg of the quarter-final tie, he was at fault for both goals in a 2-2 draw and was even dropped for a midweek match against Newcastle.",
      "He returned for the second leg, with both Harry Maguire and Leny Yoro throwing their weight behind the 29-year-old, indicating how much respect Onana's United peers have for him. The Red Devils progressed past Lyon dramatically before losing to Tottenham in the final 1-0.",
      "\"I think first and foremost, Andre has proven in his past that he is an excellent goalkeeper,\" Maguire commented. \"He has proven that at Inter, he has won numerous trophies and played in a Champions League final.",
      "\"During a career, you always have spells where you have ups and downs and find yourself a little bit out of form. It is about how you build yourself back in and find that confidence to perform again,\" he added, with Yoro stating: \"Now, Andre, we're with him, of course, we support him.\"",
      "Onana reciprocates such respect, as he told PA last year: \"In the beginning it was difficult. I am used to moving to [different] countries but it took me six months to feel good here. I was lucky because I have good team-mates, they were helping me.",
      "\"When I arrived here, I arrived as the best goalkeeper in the world and boom, it went down and you see how difficult football is sometimes. It depends on you if you want to stay down there or if you want to stand up and fight.",
      "\"But I decided to not stay there but to stand up and fight. Because I know who I am. I know what I did to arrive here and never forget what you did. Never stay too high but also don't stay too low, because at the end of the day, being a player for such a big club, when you win it's top and when you don't win it's terrible.\"",
      "Onana's colleagues haven't always been so warm. In May, during their Europa League final loss, he and midfielder Casemiro got into a heated argument after a cheap corner was given away early in the game. It was during the competition, too, that ex-Red Devil and former Lyon star Nemanja Matic dubbed Onana \"one of the worst goalkeepers in Manchester United's history.\"",
      "Regardless, Onana will now wave goodbye to Old Trafford for the time being, despite most of his team-mates consistently having his back. He is able to make such a move because the Turkish transfer window does not close until September 12, unlike the British market, which shut on September 1.",

      "Benjamin Sesko has been told that his decision to avoid stepping up for a penalty until late in the shootout against Grimsby \"will be an issue within the dressing room\" as the Manchester United new boy continues to cop flack.",
      "The Slovenian was Ruben Amorim's most expensive signing of the summer and arrives with a huge reputation. Sesko is viewed as one of Europe's best young strikers but chose not to put his hand up in the Carabao Cup loss at the League Two side until late on.",
      "Sesko, who is yet to start a Premier League game or find the net, watched on as every outfield player stepped up. He eventually took the 10th penalty and converted from 12 yards, but much more was expected from a player signed for such a fee.",
      "Dietmar Hamann insists Sesko has to get off on the right foot, and allowing defenders to step up ahead of him will not help his standing within the dressing room - urging him against repeating the trick.",
      "He told CoinPoker: “Now, if you play a League Two side in the League Cup and it goes to a penalty shootout, and you cost £85million, you've got to take one of the first five penalties. You have to, because the players will look at you. The fans will look at you because it will be an issue within the dressing room, I can tell you that.",
      "“Because a centre-back or a full-back has to take a penalty and the star signing doesn't take one until the 10th penalty. This is what he has to be aware of because if you do one or two things like this early on in your career, the career might be finished at this club before it starts because you've got people against you. I think he has to be aware of it.",
      "“I don't know who advises him, I don't know who he listens to, but I think somebody should have a word with him and tell him about the dynamics within a team or a dressing room or a club like Manchester United, because he mustn't do this again. If he does, as I said, it could be over before it started.”",
      "It was later explained that Sesko, who played a full match for the first time in months, had been struggling with cramp and United were hoping to avoid using him until they had no other option. The Slovenian has continued to make do with cameos off the bench in the league.",
      "That has hindered his ability to find the net and he's still waiting to have a major impact for the struggling outfit. Eyebrows were raised when Joshua Zirkzee was bought on ahead of him in the win over Burnley, but Sesko insists he is progressing every day as he adapts to his new challenge.",

      "Andre Onana furiously ranted at Harry Maguire when a slack pass from the defender gifted Borussia Dortmund a chance during Manchester United's final pre-season friendly in the USA in 2023.",
      "Maguire kept his cool while he was berated. Some fans said the reaction was unnecessary in a friendly, while other supporters were pleased to see Onana quickly lay down the law.",
      "Just weeks later, Onana was fortunate not to chuck away three points against Wolves on his debut when he crashed into Sasa Kalajdzic in the box and failed to make contact with the ball.",
      "Wolves were denied a blatant penalty and the PGMOL apologised to a dumbfounded Gary O'Neil.",
      "Onana got away with the huge error on his debut, but the episode foreshadowed his topsy-turvy stint at Old Trafford, which has culminated in Trabzonspor being on the cusp of signing him on loan.",
      "Onana signed from Inter Milan in a deal worth £47million and was expected to be a transformative signing. In reality, he has struggled to back up his vociferous nature with substance.",
      "The Cameroon international's performances in the Champions League group stage in his first season were error-strewn. And the first mistake Onana made came during a narrow defeat to Bayern Munich in September 2023, allowing Leroy Sane's tame shot to trickle through his fingertips.",
      "Onana requested to speak to the media following the final whistle, saying: \"I'm the one who let the team down. The team were good, but because of me, we didn't win this game, so we just have to move on. This is the life of a goalkeeper and if we didn't win today, it's on me.\"",
      "United fans respected Onana for taking responsibility for his error during the interview. Two clean sheets followed that night in Germany and it seemed like he'd turned a corner.",
      "But an awful performance in the Champions League against Galatasaray, in which he gifted the opposition a penalty and went down far too easily for the matchwinner, followed.",
      "There was redemption against Copenhagen, with Onana saving a 97th-minute penalty to seal a 1-0 victory, but United finished bottom of their group with just four points.",
      "Onana was partly to blame for the club's worst performance in the Champions League group stage.",
      "He began to improve in the winter, demonstrating impressive resilience to deliver strong displays in the Premier League. He notably kept a clean sheet in an ugly 0-0 draw against Liverpool at Anfield in December 2023, becoming the first goalkeeper to do so that season. He ended his first season strongly and started 2024/2025 in the same vein of form.",
      "Onana won the Premier League's save of the month award for his double stop against Crystal Palace in September 2024 and somehow bettered it against Fenerbahce in October. Then it all started to go downhill for when United lost 2-0 against Arsenal in December.",
      "The Cameroon international conceded two goals from corners, which was followed by a mistake against Nottingham Forest and another error against Viktoria Plzen in the Europa League.",
      "Then the Lyon debacle happened in April. Nemanja Matic said Onana was \"statistically one of the worst goalkeepers in Man United modern history\" before the first leg, and Onana was subsequently at fault for both goals.",
      "United pulled off a special victory against Lyon in the reverse match at Old Trafford and Onana sprinted to embrace Ruben Amorim on the touchline when Maguire got him out of jail.",
      "But fans lost patience with Onana last season and will be relieved to see him leave on loan.",
      "Erratic is probably the perfect word to describe Onana. He is not a goalkeeper who can be relied upon and can make embarrassing howlers at unexpected moments during matches.",
      "United allowed David de Gea to leave upon the expiry of his contract in the summer of 2023 because his mistakes had become too regular and some performances were indefensible.",
      "Onana has made a similar number of errors at United without having the previous credit that De Gea had banked. It was still the correct decision to allow De Gea to leave because United needed to sign a modern goalkeeper, but it's impossible to reject the suggestion that the succession was botched.",
      "Onana prepared for this season under the assumption he would remain at Old Trafford, but Amorim has axed him from his plans and a joint decision was made to send him on loan.",
      "Altay Bayindir has begun the campaign as first choice between the sticks. Onana was recalled to face Grimsby in the Carabao Cup and made a mistake for their second goal, which means he has made a shocking nine errors leading to a goal since the beginning of last season.",
      "Sources close to the player have noted he will receive a pay rise in Turkey, partly due to the low tax rate for Super Lig players and the signing-on fee he will receive. They are clutching at straws to try to find positives.",
      "Onana has suffered a spectacular fall from grace. He started in a Champions League final in June 2023, but will now play for a club that is not even considered among Turkey's traditional powerhouses.",
      "The failure to cut out mistakes has cost Onana his career in Manchester.",

      "The 29-year-old is set to complete a loan move to Trabzonspor once he returns from international duty with Cameroon, who play Cape Verde in a World Cup qualifier on Tuesday night.",
      "Trabzonspor have agreed to pay Onana's entire wages during his loan spell. The goalkeeper will also receive a pay rise due to Turkey's 20 per cent tax rate for players in the Super Lig.",
      "Onana was omitted from the United squad to face Arsenal, despite having three training sessions under his belt.",
      "He was then named on the bench for Premier League games against Fulham and Burnley. He did face Grimsby Town in the Carabao Cup and was at fault for their second goal.",
      "United completed the £18.2million (plus add-ons) signing of Lammens from Royal Antwerp on the final day of the summer window, which pushed Onana further down the pecking order.",
      "On deadline day, club sources were unable to clarify how Lammens' arrival would impact the goalkeeper hierarchy, but a decision has now been made to ship out Onana to Turkey.",
      "Onana made high-profile mistakes against Nottingham Forest, Viktoria Plzen and Lyon last season, and he clashed with Nemanja Matic on the eve of facing Lyon in the Europa League quarter-final first leg.",
      "Matic said Onana is \"one of the worst goalkeepers in Manchester United history\" at a press conference. The midfielder added Onana needed to \"take care\" of what he had been talking about.",
      "Onana responded on social media, writing: \"I would never be disrespectful to another club. We know that tomorrow will be a difficult game against a strong opponent.",
      "\"We focus on preparing a performance to make our fans proud. At least I’ve lifted trophies with the greatest club in the world. Some can’t say the same.\"",
      "The Turkish transfer window does not close until Friday, September 12.",

      "Andre Onana has endured a difficult two years in Manchester.",
      "The goalkeeper is set to move on loan to Trabzonspor before the Turkish transfer window closes on Friday, and it's difficult to imagine a scenario where he returns to Manchester United as first choice.",
      "Altay Bayindir has been preferred this term and Senne Lammens joined last week to add further competition. Onana has been the fall guy.",
      "He joined for more than £40million after starring for Inter Milan in their run to the 2023 Champions League final and despite some bright moments, will be remembered more for blunders than consistency.",
      "Yet there was a period where Onana looked to have discovered the composure and calmness needed. The Cameroon international enjoyed a poor start to his United career but ended that first season with an FA Cup winner's medal.",
      "When Ruben Amorim replaced Erik ten Hag, Onana was perhaps enjoying his best and most stable period of his Old Trafford career.",
      "He saved a penalty against Southampton, made a memorable double save against Crystal Palace and repeated the feat against Fenerbahce in Europe.",
      "That period was also when Onana was working under goalkeeper coach Jelle ten Rouwelaar at United.",
      "The former Burnley coach arrived at Old Trafford in the summer of 2024 and formed a strong working relationship with the clutch of keepers. The Dutchman impressed veteran Tom Heaton with innovative drills on the pre-season tour of America while Onana described him as a 'fantastic coach'.",
      "Ten Rouwelaar was tasked with helping United play out from the back more effectively and also improve the decision-making of goalkeepers. Onana seemed to thrive.",
      "Amorim's appointment meant ten Rouwelaar was moved on with the new boss bringing in his own staff. Yet Ruud van Nistelrooy, who was alongside ten Rouwelaar on the Old Trafford staff and then worked with him during his brief spell as interim boss of United, was impressed. He took him to Leicester City and was effusive with his praise of the former United man.",
      "“He worked with Onana at United and I think he was in the best form of his life in the months he worked with Jelle,\" said Van Nistelrooy in January.",
      "\"He’s a fantastic addition to the team. He’s not only improving the goalkeepers and playing out, but the players around the keeper to do better.",
      "“Of course, you need everyone to be involved in playing out from the back and that whole process he’s great at.”",
      "Ten Rouwelaar is now at Brighton, having joined the Seagulls in the summer. For Onana, the second half of last season failed to build on the levels of the first and he was dropped for the final game of the campaign against Aston Villa. His only appearance since was at Grimsby in the Carabao Cup defeat and his United career effectively looks over.",
      "Onana has made plenty of high profile mistakes, but he's been hampered by a poor team in front of him and the constant changing of coaches cannot have helped either.",
      "The short-lived Ten Rouwelaar era seemed to bring out the best in the goalkeeper. Onana now faces a long road back.",

      "Manchester United paused for the September international break on the back of a much-needed first victory of the season.",
      "The dramatic 3-2 success against Burnley alleviated some of the pressure that had been building following a defeat to Arsenal, a draw at Fulham and a woeful cup exit at the hands of fourth-tier Grimsby Town.",
      "United are ninth in the league on four points - ahead of Manchester City as the two teams prepare to face off in the Manchester derby this week.",
      "And while Ruben Amorim will have been mightily relieved to see his side snatch three points against the Clarets late on, he will know that much more is required if United are to challenge for a place in the top six come the end of the season. Here are three issues Amorim must address in the coming weeks.",
      "It feels like the United midfield has been in need of a sort-out for much of the past decade.",
      "Amorim has pushed Bruno Fernandes back into the middle since the arrival of Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo, but the skipper is not a natural for the number eight role in terms of defensive awareness and positioning.",
      "That has seen a return for veteran Casemiro alongside him, with the Brazil international's nous and experience seeing him earn a spot in the side at the expense of the seemingly unfancied Kobbie Mainoo and Manuel Ugarte.",
      "The latter was supposed to be the great solution in the middle, but you can't say with any certainty that he, Mainoo and Casemiro will be at Old Trafford next season.",
      "A central midfielder will be the next transfer priority, but in the short term, Amorim has to find a combination that can provide the steel and athleticism needed.",
      "United have more senior goalkeeper options than they do central midfielders, with the arrival of Senne Lammens taking the tally to four.",
      "That might be reduced by one should Andre Onana depart for Trabzonspor on loan, with the 29-year-old reportedly weighing up an offer.",
      "Altay Bayindir has held the gloves in the Premier League thus far but failed to convince, while Tom Heaton, soon to be 40, seems destined to be third choice regardless in whichever combination of keepers remains.",
      "Lammens may well emerge as No. 1, but it would be a big ask to throw the 23-year-old in for a debut in the Manchester derby regardless of Bayindir's shortcomings.",
      "But United need consistency and to pick a horse and back it. Lammens might just be the best bet.",
      "Amorim has been ruthless with his squad - he's jettisoned Marcus Rashford and Alejandro Garnacho, among others, and Onana could follow the 'bomb squad' in departing the club this summer.",
      "Now the United boss will want his players to be ruthless in the final third. United have scored four goals in three games - and missed a penalty - but half that tally came through own goals and one via Bruno Fernandes' last-gasp match-winning spot kick against Burnley. Mbuemo's goal in the same game is the only open play strike United have netted in the league.",
      "While that paints a negative picture, the underlying numbers are positive. United could and should have been out of sight against Burnley after a dominant first half, while they spurned chances against both Fulham and Arsenal.",
      "Indeed, if the table was ranked by expected goals, United would be top with 6.78, while they have also taken more shots than any other side in the Premier League and had more touches in the opposition box with 42 and 99, respectively.",
      "This suggests United are attacking with intent and purpose but failing to convert chances. Amorim will hope Cunha's injury is not too serious while believing Mbeumo can build on his goal at Burnley and that Benjamin Sesko can find his feet following his arrival.",

      "Manchester United goalkeeper Andre Onana is closing in on a move to Turkish side Trabzonspor, but he did have the chance to move to another Premier League side in the final days of the window, according to latest reports.",
      "The arrival of deadline day signing Senne Lammens from Royal Antwerp has seen Onana fall down the pecking order at Old Trafford this season. Altay Bayindir has been preferred to him in the Premier League so far, with his only appearance coming in the penalty shootout loss against League Two Grimsby Town in the Carabao Cup.",
      "While the transfer window may now be closed in England, the window remains open in Turkey meaning that players can still complete moves to clubs in the league. A loan move to Trabzonspor now looks to be on the cards for Onana.",
      "A fresh report from talkSPORT now claims that before the end of the summer transfer window in the UK, West Ham United were given the chance to sign Onana on a loan deal from United. It was a move that the outlet claims was ‘actively considered’ by the Hammers’ hierarchy.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "However, Onana’s performance against Grimsby, where two of his errors in goal led to both Grimsby goals, raised concerns over a potential move. West Ham chairman David Sullivan then pulled the plug on the deal, the report adds.",
      "West Ham are now said to be instead closing in on a move for 40-year-old free agent Lukasz Fabianski. The goalkeeper only left West Ham at the end of last season, but could be in line for a sensational return to the London Stadium as they look to strengthen their goalkeeping options.",
      "The report suggests that United were considering Onana’s future at the club before deadline day. At that time, club sources were unable to clarify how the arrival of Lammens would impact the goalkeeping situation at Old Trafford.",
      "It now seems, however, that the decision has been made to allow Onana to leave the club. It will therefore see Bayindir and Lammens battle it out to be first choice for Ruben Amorim with Tom Heaton playing backup to both.",

      "Manchester United have been told they let a player leave the club this summer who has 'been better than Casemiro and Manuel Ugarte'.",
      "The summer transfer window was a busy few months for the Reds despite Ruben Amorim warning that his club could struggle to complete business. United's attack has enjoyed a complete overhaul after the defence was solidified during the January window.",
      "On deadline day, United managed to add Senne Lammens to their squad to bolster the goalkeeping department and ensure the Reds had a solid, if not spectacular window. However, the one area of the pitch that remained untouched was midfield.",
      "The Reds did not bring any players of note into the centre of the pitch but did manage to keep Kobbie Mainoo, despite him requesting a loan spell away from the club. One player who did leave Old Trafford on loan was Toby Collyer.",
      "Collyer filled in last season for the Reds but the decision was made by Amorim and United that he would be best served gaining regular football in the Championship. West Bromwich Albion were the lucky club to win the race for the 21-year-old who has so far made three brief appearances for the Baggies.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "\"[He was better] at times last season and now he is there [West Brom] on loan.\" MEN Sport understands that Collyer was keen to stay at United this campaign and battle for his place in the first-team.",

      "Ineos Energy is the oil and gas production and trade arm of Ratcliffe's empire and had, until recently, been investing money into their oil refinery in Scotland. However, the Grangemouth oil refinery closed in April 2025 and the executive chairman of Ineos Energy, Brian Gilvary, has conceded that further investment in the UK is now over.",
      "Speaking to The Telegraph, Gilvary explained: \"We have stopped investing in Britain. Our future investment will not be [in] the UK.",
      "\"There’s no question of that. The problem is that the UK has become one of the most unstable fiscal regimes in the world from a perspective of natural resources and energy.",
      "\"It means we cannot invest with any certainty because we can’t be sure what future tax rates will be.\" While Ineos Energy are now looking to invest £3bn into the US' oil and gas industry, there is no indication that this could lead Ineos' sporting operations to pull out of United.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "The Daily Mail revealed last month that the drag along clause in the Glazers and Ratcliffe's business agreement was now active. Simply put, this would allow the American majority stakeholders to sell their entire shares of the club, and those of Ineos, to another buyer without Ratcliffe being able to stop it.",
      "These clauses are often included to prevent minority stakeholders from holding those with the majority to ransom by refusing to sell. While Ratcliffe has acknowledged this clause openly and hinted that he hoped it would not be triggered, he could be forced into a tricky situation had Sheikh Jassim bin Hamad Al Thani renewed his interest.",
      "However, the Mail understands that the Qatari businessman is highly unlikely to do that. There is thought to be little appetite for purchasing United now considering the success of Qatari-owned PSG and the scale of the task to return the Reds to the top.",
      "Instead, there is a feeling in the country that their new priority is to gain the host country accolade for the Olympics 2036. Their current major competition for that honour is India.",

      "Manchester United legend Gary Neville has responded after Nottingham Forest sacked Nuno Espirito Santo.",
      "Last season, Neville and Forest butted heads several times due to the former's criticism of the club's owner Evangelos Marinakis. The tension began after the former United captain disagreed with the club's decision to openly criticise the officials after a perceived refereeing error against Everton.",
      "Neville has previously accused Marinakis of running Forest like a 'mafia gang' which Sky later apologised for. However, the situation came to a head after Forest's draw to local rivals Leicester City.",
      "Marinakis was seen conducting a heated conversation with Espirito Santo on the pitch after the owner stormed onto the field. Neville described this as 'scandalous' and insisted the former Wolves and Tottenham Hotspur manager should 'negotiate his exit'.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "The United icon then took to social media to suggest he had been 'banned' which Forest refute but did admit they rejected the request to award Neville a pass. The feud between Neville and Forest is not thought to have been resolved heading into this campaign and it seems the former defender was an interested observer after Marinakis and his boardroom chose to relieve Espirito Santo of his duties at the club.",
      "Espirito Santo recently admitted that his relationship with the Forest owner had become strained. It is believed this breakdown was caused by the appointment of Arsenal's former sporting director Edu.",
      "Following the announcement, Neville simply shared the news to his Instagram story, declining to pass comment. It remains to be seen if the pundit will pass any further comment on the situation this week as the Premier League returns.",
      "Marinakis has wasted little time replacing Santo. Forest have already confirmed the appointment of Ange Postecoglou as their next manager.",

      "Casemiro has started the first three Premier League matches of this season despite entering the final 12 months of his contract at Old Trafford.",
      "The former Real Madrid midfielder has been persistently linked with a move away from the club over the last year or so and seen his ability to perform at the highest level questioned, but has fought his way into Amorim's plans.",
      "Reports in Brazil suggest that the 33-year-old is set to return to South America next summer with Flamengo and Palmeiras both monitoring the situation.",
      "It is Sao Paulo, the club where Casemiro started his career, who could yet have the most significant impact however.",
      "Though United have not been able to offload the Brazil international to Saudi Arabia for a fee in the past, Al-Hilal and Al-Nassr are touted as prospective destinations that could still present an offer with grander wages than the player earns in Manchester.",
      "MEN Sport: There would be little surprise to see Casemiro leave next summer, it's perhaps more astonishing that he still has a starting role at United currently. While the lure of the financial boost of the Middle East will be tempting, a romantic return to Brazil would offer some magic at the end of a very successful career for the veteran.",
      "Adam Wharton, Carlos Baleba and Ruben Neves are on Manchester United's shortlist as they weigh up strengthening the position having been unable to do so over the summer.",
      "Crystal Palace star Wharton is said to top the wishlist according to teamtalk and has been touted for a big move since making the transition from Blackburn to the Premier League look very easy.",
      "He will not come cheaply with Palace happy to dig in their heels, but United already know it could take as much as £115 million to prise Baleba away from Brighton. Both players would command a premium during the January window.",
      "Neves, on the other hand, has a year remaining on his Al Hilal contract and could offer a more affordable option despite the salary demands that could be prompted as a result.",
      "MEN Sport says: You can't argue with the pedigree of talent United are looking at in this instance. Ruben Neves has perhaps been there and done it more than the others but after a spell in Saudi Arabia, whether he could hit the ground running in January is not certain.",
      "The cost of January deals probably makes any of these moves prohibitive and if they are of interest it should have been done already. Maybe next year.",

The forward is considering his international future, but Wales boss Bellamy has warned he still has a long way to go before he features for their senior squad.",

      "United added goalkeeper Senne Lammens on deadline day, with the Belgian adding to the attacking arrivals of Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo, plus youngster Diego Leon, as Ruben Amorim reshaped his squad ahead of the September 1 deadline.",
      "And while Premier League clubs are not able to get any more new faces through the door after the window shut earlier this week, there remain opportunities to sell any unwanted stars to clubs whose domestic windows remain open. And United could capitalise on the chance to do just that.",
      "The window in Turkey remains open until September 12, with Andre Onana linked with a loan switch to Trabzonspor, with the 29-year-old reportedly weighing up the switch.",
      "The Cameroon international has yet to start a league game and the arrival of Lammens has added a further layer of competition in the United goalkeeping department.",
      "It's not just Onana who is under pressure, with Altay Bayindir also coming in for criticism in the opening weeks of the campaign. He has started all three Premier League matches but made errors against Arsenal and Burnley and has yet to fully convince.",
      "While United are unlikely to let both goalkeepers depart, Turkey international Bayindir has also been linked with a move to his homeland this summer.",
      "Meanwhile, unwanted defender Tyrell Malacia remains at Old Trafford after his loan move to Spanish side Elche collapsed late in the window.",
      "The 26-year-old is another who could seal a United exit in the coming days, with a switch to Turkey a possibility.",
      "The window in Saudi Arabia has plenty of days left to run, closing on September 23.",
      "Several Premier League teams have capitalised on the willingness by Saudi Pro League clubs to spend big on talent in recent years. Darwin Nunez was the highest-profile player to leave an English club for Saudi this summer.",
      "United defender Harry Maguire is reportedly wanted by clubs in the Saudi Pro League, but any exit for the England international in the coming weeks seems unlikely.",
      "Other windows still open include Greece (September 12) and Serbia (September 17).",

      "But the hype around his potential in Paraguay is huge. Cerro Porteno chairman Juan Jose Zapag described him as 'a left-back like no other in the world, the kind that's rare to find'.",
      "And his motivation now will be to try and force his way into his country's thinking ahead of the 2026 World Cup.",

      "A new midfielder and centre-back continue to be on their radar after the positions were left in the previous window. With no European football to contend with, United are hoping to continue their rebuild.",
      "With that in mind, MEN Sport takes a look at the latest transfer news from Old Trafford...No",
      "On the subject of defensive reinforcements, United are hoping to launch a move for Sporting CP centre-back Zeno Debast. GiveMeSport have claimed that the Reds are monitoring the 21-year-old and could make their move.",
      "It's claimed United have sent scouts to watch Debast after previously working with Amorim. The defender has a £70m release clause in his contract in Lisbon.",
      "MEN Sport says: \"Debast falls into the category of players who have showcased their quality in Europe but have question marks over his ability at the top level. However, at 21, he's had potential for a number of years dating back to his Anderlecht days.",
      "\"United are well-stocked in defence meaning a move for an inexperienced individual would give him the time to develop at Old Trafford. However, they can't justify that price tag so they'd have to look at a way of structuring the right financial package.\"",
      "In January, United are planning to launch an official bid for Brighton & Hove Albion midfielder Carlos Baleba to fend off interest from rivals.",

      "\"Like defence, midfield is a priority for Amorim, a holding one to be precise. Baleba may cost a fair bit but he could be the perfect fit. However, the £115m+ price tag being touted means a January deal feels unlikely.\"",

      "Last month, a Manchester United staff member touched on the future of Rhys Bennett.",
      "\"Rhys has his sights set high,\" they said. That comment was perceived as Bennett wanting a loan in the Championship, but perhaps it was alluding to the youngster's ambition to break into the senior squad.",
      "In the final days of the transfer window, United sources said Bennett could still go out on loan, which seemed the most logical option for the defender after his Fleetwood Town stint.",
      "However, it became clear in the final hours of deadline day that Bennett was unlikely to leave.",
      "That leaves the 21-year-old in an interesting situation because he has clearly outgrown academy football. Bennett will only gain match fitness from playing for the Under-21s in the first half of the campaign.",
      "Could Bennett contribute to the first-team squad? With the benefit of hindsight, maybe that is what the United staff member meant, so don't be surprised to see him in training at Carrington.",
      "Bennett has not made his first-team debut for United, although he could sense an opportunity after Tyler Fredricson was involved. Fredricson was named on the bench against Arsenal and Fulham, and he started against Grimsby Town before being hooked at half-time in the Carabao Cup debacle.",
      "Fredricson made two senior appearances last season. Bennett is slightly older, more experienced after his Fleetwood loan and may fancy his chances of usurping his fellow academy graduate in Ruben Amorim's plans.",
      "No player emerged with credit from the Grimsby performance, but it was a particularly tough evening for Fredricson, who received an earful from Amorim throughout the first half.",
      "Fredricson has always had a strong reputation in academy circles. Bennett is also highly regarded and captained the Under-18s to FA Youth Cup success at Old Trafford in 2021/22.",
      "Kobbie Mainoo, Alejandro Garnacho and Dan Gore starred in that supremely talented young team, but Bennett was the captain and opened the scoring in the final against Nottingham Forest.",
      "In the last three years, Bennett has watched Mainoo, Garnacho, Gore and Charlie McNeill make their senior United debuts. He shared the dressing room with those players during the FA Youth Cup run, but he's been forced to bide his time and work hard to get a sniff of a potential opening.",
      "Has that opening finally emerged? The Denton-born lad has the next six months to achieve what he dreamt about as a kid: a debut for United. The time is now for him to push toward making it a reality.",
      "It won't be easy for Bennett, but he must back himself to progress after watching Fredricson receive minutes. They play in the same position and Bennett will think he can achieve what Fredricson has.",
      "Bennett should be hardened from his Fleetwood loan last season. The centre-back made 38 appearances across all competitions and gained crucial experience of fighting for points each week.",
      "\"That has been massive for me and I like having that bit of added pressure to games and scenarios,\" said Bennett last season about playing competitive football with Fleetwood.",
      "“When I was younger, I used to get carried away with thinking, ‘what's the next couple of years going to look like?’ You can lose focus on what's in front of you right now. It’s still in the back of my mind, but the focus is on the next game and getting the most out of this.”",
      "The elephant in the room is that Bennett is unlikely to feature prominently. Amorim has Leny Yoro, Matthijs de Ligt, Luke Shaw; Harry Maguire, Ayden Heaven and Noussair Mazraoui as options for the back-three.",
      "Lisandro Martinez will also return from the sidelines in the coming weeks. However, injuries could completely change the state of play and Bennett will be ready if an opportunity arises.",

      "According to reports, Manchester United co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe ‘supported the decision’ to offload Andre Onana, which has taken the 29-year-old ‘by surprise’.",
      "The Cameroonian goalkeeper – who joined the Red Devils from Inter for around £45million in 2023 – injured his hamstring in pre-season but was fit and available for the club’s opener against Arsenal, only to be left out of the squad.",
      "He returned the following week at Fulham, but only as a substitute as Ruben Amorim stuck with Altay Bayindir.",
      "Onana was handed his first start of 2025/26 against Grimsby Town in the second round of the Carabao Cup, but was at fault for both of the Mariners’ goals before getting his hand to, but failing to keep out, several penalties in the embarrassing shootout defeat.",
      "READ: Exclusive: Ex-Manchester United player hits out at ‘arrogant’ Red Devils star – ‘he’s been a disaster’",
      "Bayindir returned for the Red Devils’ first Premier League win of the season against Burnley three days later, with Belgian goalkeeper Senne Lammens joining on deadline day.",
      "Lammens is expected to take Bayindir’s spot in the team, though it’s unclear if he will be thrown into the deep end for Sunday’s derby against Manchester City.",
      "United stepped up their attempts to move Onana on after Lammens’ arrival, with their options limited to Turkey and Saudi Arabia after the closure of every other relevant transfer window.",
      "The Turkish window closes on Friday and everything is in place for Onana to complete his move to Trabzonspor and face Fenerbahce on Sunday.",
      "A report from the Daily Mail gives details on how the former Inter goalkeeper’s departure transpired, with it claimed that Ratcliffe ‘supported the decision’, in a ‘surprising’ twist.",
      "Indeed, Ratcliffe’s internal backing of ditching Onana ‘took the player by surprise’. It’s said, however, that talks took place between head coach Amorim and director of football Jason Wilcox, who didn’t want the Cameroonian’s situation to ‘distract’ new signing Lammens while he tries to ‘settle in’.",

      "Ratcliffe mentioned in March Onana when criticising the club’s transfer business before he purchased a 25 per cent stake in February 2024.",
      "“If you look at the players we are buying this summer, that we didn’t buy, we’re buying Antony, we’re buying Casemiro, we’re buying Onana, we’re buying [Rasmus] Hojlund, we’re buying [Jadon] Sancho.",
      "“These are all things from the past, whether we like it or not, we’ve inherited those things and have to sort that out.",
      "“Some are not good enough and some probably are overpaid, but for us to mould the squad that we are fully responsible for, and accountable for, will take time.”",
      "Onana was linked with French side AS Monaco earlier in the window, but they were put off by United’s £30million valuation. After that deal failed to materialise, the former Ajax star ‘expected to stay at Old Trafford’, the report adds.",
      "However, Amorim ‘was unhappy’ when Onana tore his hamstring on the second day of pre-season, days after a video emerged of him playing outfield on a muddy pitch with friends in Cameroon.",
      "The Mail Sport report adds:",
      "But the 29-year-old became worried when he was left out of the opening game of the season against Arsenal despite recovering from the hamstring injury, and those concerns only grew when Bayindir started the second game at Fulham as well.",
      "Onana was recalled for the Carabao Cup tie at Grimsby, but an error in United’s embarrassing defeat on penalties proved to be the final straw. Lammens was signed five days later and United informed Onana that it would be better for him to find a new club.",
      "His options were limited because Turkey and Saudi Arabia were among the few countries where the transfer window remained open, but a loan to Trabzonspor was negotiated quickly.",
      "The Turkish club are expected to sign the final paperwork before Friday’s deadline, and Onana is due to fly to Trabzon from Paris on Thursday. The goalkeeper, who will double his salary under the terms of the loan, is set to make his debut against Fenerbahce on Sunday.",
      "Andre Onana has received a damning verdict from former Manchester United defender Paul Parker after he was a “disaster” at Old Trafford.",

      "Transfer expert Fabrizio Romano has revealed that Manchester United head coach Ruben Amorim has made a key “decision” to prevent a “problem” at the club.",
      "As Man Utd wave off another goalkeeper, we’ve ranked the 13 regulars to guard their goal since Fergie arrived. Andre Onana doesn’t come out of this well…",
      "Andre Onana’s reward for being a Manchester United goalkeeping flop is a Turkish league title fight and doubled wages.",
      "Manchester United goalkeeper Andre Onana has reportedly ‘decided’ whether to ‘give the green light’ over a move to a Turkish club."

      "Manchester United’s ‘bomb squad’ strategy has been praised by former player Rio Ferdinand after unwanted goalkeeper Andre Onana was shown the door.",
      "United legend Ferdinand has never hidden his affinity for his old club, even when his punditry might have had more credibility for doing so. When it comes to his podcast, he’s more than willing to give it both barrels – once a Manchester United defender, always a Manchester United defender.",
      "It’s certainly true that the Red Devils have done some stinking transfer business over the years and Ferdinand is clearly thrilled that moves were made in the summer transfer window to freeze out and ultimately dispose of players who are ‘not worthy’ of a place at the club.",
      "Ruben Amorim made no secret of the players whose faces didn’t fit at the end of his first partial Premier League season in charge at Old Trafford.",
      "Marcus Rashford, Antony, Jadon Sancho, Alejandro Garnacho and Tyrell Malacia were all deemed surplus to requirements. Only Malacia remains after deadline day.",
      "The Red Devils had other players unwilling or unable to pull their weight and the imminent departure of goalkeeper Andre Onana on loan to Turkish side Trabzonspor is another big tick in the box for the club’s ruthless approach.",
      "Belgian stopper Senne Lammens joined United on deadline day and Onana, whose spell at Old Trafford has been riddled with mistakes and a near total lack of confidence in him from supporters, is finally on his way out.",
      "Speaking on Rio Ferdinand Presents, Rio Ferdinand presents the case for United’s cut-throat transfer tactics.",
      "“They’re not going to have players that either aren’t good enough, haven’t performed well enough or are not the right people to be at the football club,” said the 81-cap former England international.",
      "“[Omar Berrada, United’s CEO] is not going to have them around like bad smells. I think, for far too long, we’ve had at that at the football club.",
      "“We’ve been forced to keep players because of bad financial situations that the club have put us in with players and we’ve had to keep them here, sit with them and had to suffer some of these players.",
      "“As happy as I am with the players that are coming in and providing a difference in terms of speed, dynamism, pace and goal threat, I’m as pleased, if not more, with the way they’ve got players out that the club deemed weren’t right to be there.”",
      "Like ex-teammates Gary Neville and Roy Keane, Ferdinand is often outspoken on the matter of standards at Old Trafford. Having succeeded under the iron guidance of Alex Ferguson, they see their former club failing to perform and understandably question what’s going on behind the scenes.",
      "Ferguson’s United became an exemplar of professionalism and elite performance and the senior players who set those levels but now look in from the outside – at least in terms of the dressing room – clearly find it difficult to watch them slip.",
      "“I think it sends out a fantastic message and a strong message to the players that are there: you ain’t hanging about here if you ain’t what we want,” added Ferdinand.",
      "Manchester United co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe ‘supported the decision’ to offload Andre Onana, which has taken the 29-year-old ‘by surprise’.",
      "Andre Onana has received a damning verdict from former Manchester United defender Paul Parker after he was a “disaster” at Old Trafford.",
      "Do Man Utd have a new ‘untouchable’? Is he the only one? Rio Ferdinand ‘loves’ him and the Red Devils owe their legend a debt.",
      "Transfer expert Fabrizio Romano has revealed that Manchester United head coach Ruben Amorim has made a key “decision” to prevent a “problem” at the club.",
      "As Man Utd wave off another goalkeeper, we’ve ranked the 13 regulars to guard their goal since Fergie arrived. Andre Onana doesn’t come out of this well…",
      "Andre Onana’s reward for being a Manchester United goalkeeping flop is a Turkish league title fight and doubled wages."

      "According to reports, Arsenal are ‘leading the race’ to sign a Manchester United target after a ‘last-minute bid fell through’ in the summer.",
      "Arsenal had a successful summer transfer window as they landed most of their targets as one of the biggest spending clubs in Europe.",
      "Mikel Arteta and Co. realised that they needed a significant squad overhaul after finishing second in the Premier League for a third straight season, with Viktor Gyokeres, Martin Zubimendi, Eberechi Eze, Noni Madueke and Pieiro Hincapie among their notable additions.",
      "Man Utd, meanwhile, had a mixed transfer window as they overhauled their attack with the signings of Benjamin Sesko, Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha, while Senne Lammens has been brought in as their new No.1.",
      "However, Man Utd failed to sign a new midfielder as they were priced out of a move for Brighton star Carlos Baleba amid speculation that he could cost around £100m.",
      "Without a top-tier No.6, Man Utd are far too easy to play through and they were linked with other potential options, including VfB Stuttgart star Angelo Stiller.",
      "READ: Ranking the 20 biggest PL summer transfers from Chelsea ace to Liverpool flop",
      "Man Utd were sporadically linked with Stiller for most of the window, though they did not land his services amid reports that they are willing to wait to sign Baleba in January or next summer.",
      "Still, a report from Caught Offside claims Man Utd had a ‘last-minute bid fall through’ for Stiller before the summer transfer window closed as they and Stuttgart remained apart on the midfielder’s valuation.",
      "It is noted that the Bundesliga side wanted as much as £52m for their prized asset and Man Utd are no longer at the front of the queue for his signature.",
      "This is because, according to The Express, Arsenal are ‘leading the race’ to sign Stiller as they are the ‘frontunners’ to secure his services ahead of the winter transfer window.",
      "MUST-READ FEATURES ON F365…\n👉 Top 10 available managers: Nuno to be in demand while Forest eye Ange, Jose\n👉 The very best 10 players in (some) danger of missing out on World Cup 2026\n👉 Premier League team of the 2025/26 season so far has no Liverpool players",
      "There are said to be two factors behind Stiller’s decision to favour Arsenal over Man Utd.",
      "The report adds:",
      "‘With United’s bid rebuffed, the Gunners are now seen as the frontrunners to secure the German international’s signature. Mikel Arteta’s project is thought to appeal to Stiller as it prioritises young talent and offers regular playing opportunities.",
      "‘However, the midfielder is reportedly not in a hurry to leave Stuttgart. Stiller’s talents have caught the attention of clubs beyond the Premier League too.’",
      "Manchester United and Ruben Amorim are plotting one final move this summer as the club have held discussions over signing a midfielder."

      "Three games into the Premier League season feels like as good a time as any to rank summer signings and we’ve done just that with the 20 most expensive of them this summer.",
      "We’re all thoroughly looking forward to the prospect of Alexander Isak being the flop of all flops but have limited this list to those who have played in at least two of the games so far.",
      "So you can look forward to an updated version of this which includes Isak and his sulking compadre Yoane Wissa, along with Nick Woltemade, Eberechi Eze, Xavi Simons and Alejandro Garnacho, but for now it’s just the 14.",
      "",
      "Probably not the worst performer of everyone listed here, but all things considered – the cost, his reputation, a full pre-season – he merits bottom spot, with Liverpool arguably winning all three of their opening three games in spite of him.",
      "Maybe it’s a coincidence that they’re struggling for attacking fluency but BILD’s report of Germany’s shock World Cup qualifying defeat to Slovakia which stated that Wirtz ‘couldn’t live up to the demands placed on him’ feels equally applicable to the start of his Premier League career. Poor lad ‘has forgotten his joy’.",
      "MAILBOX: Everybody makes the same point about Florian Wirtz and Kevin de Bruyne…",
      "",
      "Four off-target shots in 80 minutes of Premier League football off the bench following a £66m move to solve Ruben Amorim’s goalscoring woes probably isn’t exactly what he had in mind, and he did himself no favours by stepping up tenth in the penalty shootout defeat to Grimsby Town having put a stoppage-time chance over the bar from roughly four yards out to ensure the game went that far.",
      "",
      "Feels nailed on to be the next talented forward Chelsea can’t be arsed to develop before flipping for profit, or at least for no great loss within the next two years. Started the opening-day draw with Crystal Palace but was hooked early in that one before two brief substitute appearances ahead of the signing of Alejandro Garnacho to provide further competition for his already limited game time.",
      "READ: Chelsea’s successful transfer model not the one football needs, but the one it deserves",
      "",
      "Really quite unfair to judge a guy signed to create chances for a striker Newcastle haven’t had for the opening three games of the season, but it’s all we can do. There’s plenty of room for improvement.",
      "READ: Newcastle fleeced for extra £90m as Liverpool stung for Alexander Isak",
      "",
      "The calls for Andrew Robertson’s return to the starting line-up aren’t yet widespread, but there have certainly been suggestions that Arne Slot may revert to the tried and tested left-back, at least before a better outing for Kerkez against Arsenal, after some worrying signs that he’s one of the new breed of defenders who don’t really like defending.",
      "",
      "The scorer of Manchester United’s Goal of the Month for August, which was revealingly described as ‘well-worked’ rather than a hoof, flick-on, bumble to the byline by Diogo Dalot and simple finish from Mbeumo. The alternatives options were two own goals or a Bruno Fernandes penalty.",
      "Mbeumo scoring a decent goal against Grimsby before missing the crucial penalty feels like a decent summary of his Red Devils career to date – about par. We’re none the wiser.",
      "",
      "Two goals in three games is a start we’re guessing both he and Mikel Arteta would have taken after an incredibly long build-up to him joining Arsenal and then a short pre-season because of that dragging of feet. That first goal against Leeds was so perfectly Gyokeres – direct and powerful before a top finish – while it’s also nice to get off the mark from the penalty spot. Plenty more of those to come, we suspect.",
      "But he did also look like a but of a lump in the games against Manchester United and Liverpool to grant some early doors flat-track bully theories.",
      "",
      "Given we may never have been more invested in an Arsenal player doing well we briefly wondered whether the #NOTOMADUEKE petition was actually signed by a bunch of genius Gunners seeking support from the masses for one of their big summer signings.",
      "We gave our heads a wobble and reverted to our previous opinion of them a bunch of unthinkable tw*ts lacking any sort of human decency, which will allow us to continue to enjoy Madueke’s performances after a promising start to his Arsenal career.",
      "",
      "Who needs Kevin De Bruyne? Oh, we do. One excellent performance against Wolves was followed by two hugely uninspiring displays for City’s new midfielder.",
      "",
      "He’s not off the mark yet like his fellow United inverted winger summer signing, but has still looked as though he will be the better addition as we suspected before the season started. Got a ways to go to prove he’s some sort of Eric Cantona regen, mind.",
      "",
      "We’ve not really noticed him and while we accept the argument that that’s sort of the point with players of his ilk who sit at the base of midfield, keeping things ticking along while allowing others to attack and express themselves, it got to a point with Rodri before his injury where we couldn’t keep our eyes off him.",
      "It may be a slight concern that Zubimendi has looked far, far better for Spain in their World Cup qualifiers than he has done for Arsenal, but then maybe it’s time for us all to accept that Arsenal are not Spain.",
      "",
      "Suspicions that those questioning Kudus’ price tag after a very ordinary output of five goals and three assists last season were missing the obvious ‘but he was playing for West Ham caveat’ have been confirmed through his displays for Spurs.",
      "He put the willies up PSG in the Super Cup, got two assists on the opening day win over Burnley and there’s been plenty of other evidence besides that the 25-year-old will be able to more effectively combine his enviable skill, speed and power to reap reward this season compared to last.",
      "He’s in the Premier League XI of the season so far.",
      "",
      "Ekitike said what all players must when asked about competition for places on the back of Alexander Isak’s deadline-day arrival from Newcastle, insisting he’s looking forward to the challenge rather than frankly a bit f***ed off that after three goals and an assist in four games for Liverpool he may soon be watching from the bench, though maybe not that soon.",
      "But such is his form that it’s now assumed by many that Arne Slot will look to crowbar him into the team on the left, though that also feels very unfair on Cody Gakpo, who’s arguably been the Reds’ best player so far this season.",
      "",
      "Quite clearly the best of the 427 signings BlueCo made this summer and possibly already one of the best since the takeover just over three years ago. He’s got two goals and two assists already to provide genuine hope that Chelsea have finally found a close to fully-formed striker to lead their attack. No ifs, buts, maybes or time to bed-in required for the 23-year-old bodes very well indeed.",
      "Nottingham Forest’s decision to sack Nuno Espirito Santo has not gone down well, while we have more Florian Wirtz chat.",
      "Pundit Jamie Carragher has revealed his “hot take” prediction regarding Arsenal as he is not sold on one of their summer signings.",
      "It’s not like the Daily Mail to kick a young man when he’s down; it’s his fault that England are rubbish even in his absence.",
      "According to reports, Manchester United have already ‘set their sights’ on their ‘top target’ to replace current head coach Ruben Amorim.",

      "It’s been a summer of ludicrous spending by Premier League clubs and some of the figures have been truly eyewatering.",
      "Of the 20 biggest transfers in the world this summer, 15 were made by Premier League clubs. And of the 10 biggest overpays of the summer transfer window, seven were made by Premier League clubs.",
      "The market values and the fees are taken from transfermarkt; the former are usually on the low side anyway and the fees are the initial ones before add-ons. So it’s not gospel but it’s a guide to which clubs paid rather more than they should have done…",
      "",
      "Benfica never sell on the cheap, especially when they owe a sell-on fee to Manchester United. Real Madrid were more than happy to pay slightly over the odds for a left-back, after getting one of the world’s best right-backs for very, very little.",
      "",
      "To sell Noni Madueke to Arsenal for a sizeable profit after two-and-a-half underwhelming years was some phenomenal business from Chelsea, which is becoming something of a habit for Chelsea Transfer Club.",
      "There were petitions from Arsenal fans against the signing of yet another Chelsea reject; TM suggest they should have paid far closer to £35m than £50m for the England winger. He was good against Andorra, mind.",
      "",
      "He’s in the Premier League team of the season so far, so you would struggle to find any Spurs fans moaning that they have overpaid for Kudus, even if TM have him pegged as being worth around £40m. His performances in 2024/25 for West Ham had been poor, but although he was worth nowhere near his reported £85m release clause, West Ham were never going to do business for less than £55m.",
      "",
      "As we wrote at the time: ‘Is Anthony Elanga worth £55m? Only to Newcastle but that’s what matters.’",
      "Elanga was an upgrade in the one position – at the time – that they really needed an upgrade, and Nottingham Forest were never going to be forced into a transfer for the £40m he would have been worth to any other club.",
      "",
      "We are as shocked as you that Benjamin Sesko is not on this list, though he does have youth on his side. Brentford played hardball with Manchester United over Mbeumo just as they did with Newcastle over Yoane Wissa and they emerged with an initial £65m with very achievable add-ons that are likely to take the deal past £70m.",
      "But the idea that anybody would pay more than £50m for the Brentford winger they signed for relative pennies would have seemed ludicrous just six months before.",
      "",
      "Having already sold Dean Huijsen to Barcelona, the only way Bournemouth were going to sell his defensive partner to PSG was if they came in with more than £50m. In the end, the offer was too good for club or player to turn down.",
      "",
      "It now feels almost quaint that a Saudi Arabian club made an offer that could not be turned down, but it’s fair to say that no European club was offering £56.3m for Serie A’s top scorer from last season.",
      "",
      "Worth less than Florian Wirtz according to the algorithms, but there was a Premier League and a Newcastle tax to pay for Isak. Many will agree that Liverpool have overpaid for Isak despite his obvious talents, but it was clear very early this summer that Liverpool were going to have to break the British transfer record to sign the Swede. Now they have to win the Premier League. Simple as.",
      "",
      "With just one year remaining on his contract, it is close to ridiculous that Newcastle United felt like they had no choice but to pay £50m for a 28-year-old who has only once scored more than 12 goals in a top-flight season. But Brentford absolutely had Newcastle over a barrel.",
      "",
      "As Bayern Munich’s honorary president Uli Hoeness said: “We would have liked to have Nick Woltemade. We offered 55 million, Stuttgart wanted 75. Now they’ve apparently sold him to Newcastle for almost 90 million euros. But what Newcastle is doing has nothing to do with football. It’s like Monopoly – advance to Schlossallee, then some sheikh will come along, and then you can buy.”",
      "He scored 12 Bundesliga goals last season. But by this point Newcastle were about 427 miles past desperate.",
      "Nottingham Forest’s decision to sack Nuno Espirito Santo has not gone down well, while we have more Florian Wirtz chat.",

      "Nuno Espirito Santo has ‘won’ the Sack Race after the complete breakdown of key relationships at Nottingham Forest produced the inevitable international-break outcome.",
      "That has removed one of the few managers who had been providing some cover for Man United boss Ruben Amorim, who now once again finds himself top of the list nobody wants to top.",
      "And here are possible replacement managers currently between jobs. Pretty much every one of them would have avoided defeat to Grimsby Town.",
      "",
      "There is a small yet increasingly confident part of our brain that remains stubbornly convinced Liverpool are going to completely f*ck it this season. The only real tangible thing to build this doom-laden scenario upon is a lack of depth at centre-back, but still we keep coming back to the question: what if all those exciting new attacking players turn out to be massive disaster-flops?",
      "Most of our brain thinks they probably won’t f*ck it and might even be better than last season, but even that tiny idiot part convinced of pending disaster doesn’t think it could possibly materialise quickly or dramatically enough for Slot to be in any kind of danger before at least one other poor sod has been given the hook elsewhere.",
      "Even if they were really quite shambolic defensively in the Community Shield and didn’t entirely assuage those doubts against Bournemouth either. But against Arsenal they showed the ‘mettle of champions’.",
      "",
      "It is still very early days and it’s been two big steps forward and one huge step back from his first three Tottenham games. Frank is obviously a decent coach, but none of us really know how he’ll get on outside the very specific environment he had at Brentford.",
      "Especially as Spurs’ environment is… not like that one. He’s going to have a big job on to sort out an awful lot of mess at history’s funniest ever Champions League qualifiers. He appeared to have already thoroughly De-Anged the lot of them only for them to then turn up against Bournemouth and defend like an Ange team while attacking like a Mourinho one.",
      "You know who else won their first couple of games, including one against Man City, after stepping up to Spurs from a smaller but less daft Premier League club? That’s right. But while the Nuno comparisons are obvious, and a world in which Frank doesn’t make the November international break entirely possible, it doesn’t quite feel like the same situation.",
      "Crucially, there has been no undignified scramble to find a new manager this time. Whatever your thoughts on the timing and manner of Ange Postecoglou’s sacking and the identity of his replacement, it’s also clear Spurs have got the man they wanted in a way they very obviously didn’t when Nuno came in.",
      "That surely buys Frank a bit of time even if things do get hairy. Enough at least for someone else to get canned before he does. Probably.",
      "The fact the squad has not (yet) had anything like the summer renovations it required also cuts both ways here, we fancy. Frank clearly wants a few more bodies in, but their absence means he is less likely to be first in line if and when fans start dishing out blame. That is likely to once again be Gary Neville’s new best mate, especially after the Eze Fiasco and despite the Xavi Redemption.",
      "",
      "An earlier version of this oft-updated piece speculated on what might happen to Mikel Arteta should Arsenal suffer from their Nightmare Start. What if they lost a few early games? What then? We concluded this:",
      "It’s far likelier that Arsenal emerge blinking into the autumn sunshine largely unscathed from their nightmare horrors. No denying that this season does represent one in which Arteta might completely lose the plot and go entirely off the rails. Or the one where he wins the league by 10 points. Feels like we’re odds-on to get one or the other.",
      "The first part is already locked in. So now we wait: is it full meltdown or sauntering to the league title? Nothing else will be tolerated or is indeed even possible.",
      "READ: Who will be the next manager of Arsenal if Mikel Arteta is sacked?",
      "",
      "One of the key early-season imponderables for 25/26 is just how big and what kind of impact the Club World Cup has on the way Chelsea and Man City start the season. Does the fact they’ve got plenty of (semi-)competitive games in their legs give them an early boost? Or will they just be knackered and given the runaround by fresher legs?",
      "He definitely still has some hearts and minds to win at Chelsea despite the fine finish to the season that saw them tick off Champions League qualification while completing their collection of UEFA pots and pans and then winning the actual Club World Cup.",
      "A home draw with Crystal Palace wasn’t ideal, but the paddling dished out to West Ham has what really should at least be some kind of halfway credible title bid up and running at least. And we strongly suspect Fulham won’t be the last team left scratching their head after losing to Maresca.",
      "",
      "Among the least sackable managers in the top flight, and the only club we could really picture trying to lure him away this summer was Spurs and that’s now safely off the table.",
      "It’s been a difficult summer for Bournemouth but Iraola has masses of credit in the bank and the excellent start they’ve made despite everything is only strengthening Iraola’s standing.",
      "",
      "Fine end to 24/25 put a different complexion on Brighton’s season than at one time appeared likely. Ending up a clear best of the rest outside the quickly established top seven represented at least a passing grade and they’d have to make a truly awful start to the season to get in any kind of managerial-change bother.",
      "And Brighton don’t make awful starts. They are the Anti-Wolves: they start really well and then fade a bit. Which can be annoying, but is definitely the right way round to do it if you’re a manager trying not to get sacked.",
      "",
      "Things would have to go unbelievably wrong unbelievably fast, but this is Everton so, you know. Maybe. And there are few things that straddle the blessing-curse divide in football quite like a new stadium.",
      "The benefits Everton should accrue come in the long term. In the short term there’s the loss of familiarity and – something that feels specifically important in this particular case – atmosphere while everyone gets used to the new surroundings.",
      "Defeat at Leeds on the opening weekend was distinctly squibbish, but Everton have bounced back in some style since to suggest they could not just survive but thrive. With Jack Grealish in impish early-season form, they might even be fun.",
      "",
      "Just a slightly less clear-cut version of Glasner really. Not about to be sacked, but could be in the frame for a poaching. And if that poaching comes from outside the Premier League, then he could technically be the first manager to go.",
      "",
      "West Ham at home was a kind start for Sunderland and Le Bris, but boy did they cash in. Came back down to earth with a bump at Burnley, but the late turnaround to beat Brentford means it’s a hugely encouraging start for the Black Cats and their manager.",
      "",
      "A sacking remains out of the question despite last season’s (relative) struggles. There hasn’t been a Premier League manager since Fergie in his pomp with more credit in the bank than Pep.",
      "But is there still a distinct chance Guardiola decides he’s had enough and simply walks away? We reckon there is, and it’s always worth remembering that we’re talking First Premier League Manager To Leave here, and that the traditional ‘Sack Race’ shorthand is a bit misleading.",
      "Still, though. Almost no chance that could happen swiftly enough for nobody else to have been canned first. Even if consecutive defeats brings back memories of last winter.",
      "",
      "At various points we’ve expended daft amounts of energy attempting to manifest a ‘Howe Sack’ crisis because we’re messy bitches who live for drama. But we’ve never managed to make it stick even a tiny bit and we started the summer thinking there was little imminent prospect of going for it again with Howe the hero of the Geordie Nation for delivering silverware and more lovely, lovely Champions League football.",
      "Now, though, after a traumatic summer and the Alexander Isak Saga and a troubling winless start to the season, our Spidey Sense is tingling once more. We’re going to be right back in the saddle come November after a run of two draws and a defeat leaves the Magpies seven points outside the top six.",
      "",
      "Fixture-list doom-mongery is a fool’s errand. One never truly knows before things get properly under way just who’s going to be good and who’s not. But Burnley really do have a horrible start under a manager with a horrible record at this level, and have already been given a clear reminder by the team that finished 17th last season of just how much harder the ‘simply don’t concede any goals at all’ tactic is going to be to deliver in the Premier League.",
      "Essentially, Burnley have got back to this level the same way Homer Simpson got to a heavyweight title fight. And Spurs have already given them a pummelling.",
      "Victory over Sunderland was an impressive and necessary reminder that it might still be enough against teams more on their level, but Parker will still need some fairly early evidence it can also work against established Premier League teams, which makes Burnley’s start so problematic and that win over Sunderland both vital yet potentially deceptive.",
      "There were encouraging signs before late heartbreak against eternally stupid Manchester United, but Burnley must now face Liverpool, Forest, Manchester City and Aston Villa before the first weekend of October is out. And Parker may well be too, ideally after a 9-0 defeat against Liverpool that he regards as unavoidable.",
      "",
      "Missing out on the Champions League in the manner they did was definitely a p*sser, and while Villa were perfectly good last season, it was one that felt a bit flat in the end. It was good, but it could have been great. They could have finished in the top five. They could have won the FA Cup. They could even have knocked out PSG in the Champions League after thar barnstorming Villa Park comeback.",
      "These annoyances are real and meaningful, and this season is off to a troubling start. But it’s still hard to see how they could possibly translate to Emery being in anything like the sort of bother that put him at risk of being out on his ear in the early months of the season. The latter months of the season? Could be a different tale there.",
      "",
      "The continuity candidate, but how much continuity can there be at Brentford given they’ve sold Bryan Mbeumo and Christian Norgaard, while Thomas Frank took most of the remaining coaching staff with him to Tottenham? It’s a very Brentford move to promote from within but will they be forced into the very un-Brentford move of sacking him in October when the Bees are in a relegation battle?",
      "A win over an Aston Villa side in the midst of their own funk certainly buys some time. At the very least it surely pushes any real sack talk firmly beyond the first international break, and this season that really might be enough to make you third or fourth manager out at worst.",
      "",
      "It would have made Spurs’ decision to sack Europa League-winning Ange Postecoglou look positively kind, but there remains a decent case that Leeds – and Burnley for that matter – could or even should have thanked the managers who secured 100 Championship points and got them back into the big time and then sent them on their way.",
      "Farke had a dreadful Premier League record of only six wins and 26 points from his 49 games in charge of Norwich, a team he twice led to promotion from the Championship with 94 and 97 points.",
      "As well as fighting his own record in this competition, Farke faces the added burden of expectation levels very different to those at just about any other club that could possibly find itself promoted into the Premier League in this current era where that represents the most bittersweet of successes.",
      "Leeds do look far better prepared than most for attempting the now fiendishly difficult first-season survival at this time, as victory over a disappointingly passive Everton suggested, but Farke lasted 11 games of the 21/22 season with Norwich and something similar absolutely cannot be ruled out this time.",
      "Arsenal away needn’t be a season-defining fixture, but Leeds had absolutely nothing to offer in that one from the moment the Gunners got going, which doesn’t bode well for future games against teams who aren’t as confused as Everton apparently are.",
      "Leeds were quietly impressive in a goalless draw against a despair-laden Newcastle, but the lack of goal threat is inevitably a concern.",

      "“What am I hearing?” Ferdinand said. “I’m trying to have a good, positive moment here, trying to get some positivity.",
      "“But that is testament – if I can find a positive angle on this – that is testament to his resilience, you know. You know how difficult it is to play football, not winning, but still putting out performances that are improving week in week out? That’s a big thing that, you know.”",
      "That is an extremely acute positive angle to have found, but having come through an incredibly challenging debut season largely unscathed, Yoro is showing that Ferdinand’s burgeoning “love” of him as a footballer is well founded in his second campaign. He really does look the part.",
      "And credit where it’s due, Ferdinand called it from day dot, hailing him as a talent to be reckoned with in a personal video shown to Yoro during his first interview at the club.",
      "“You’ve got all the potential, you’ve got all the tools, man, you’ve got everything there, ready to rock and roll to go and make a big impact at this club.”",
      "And United have Ferdinand to thank (along with quite significantly superior wages) for luring him to the club amid competition for his signature from Real Madrid.",
      "“It was like two weeks ago [when I first spoke to Rio],” Yoro explained last summer. “He called me. First of all, I was really impressed to speak with him and, yeah, we spoke like 10 minutes about Man United, so he helped me a lot to make my choice. It was really an honour to speak with him.”",
      "Say what you want about Ferdinand, his YouTuber schtick on commentary and whatever else, but he is a proper Manchester United legend with 455 appearances for the club to his name and 12 trophies. It must have been quite the call to receive and Ferdinand continues to sing Yoro’s praises.",

      "“He just needs the pieces around him as well to help him as a young kid, but I think he has the nucleus of all the right traits to be a top centre half and he will be because he wants to be as well.",
      "“He’s a hard worker and he’s diligent, but he needs time as well.”",
      "And it looks as though he backed and is backing the right horse in Yoro. Having got through last season without being one of the innumerable United problems, he’s now asserting himself as one of the nailed on solutions.",
      "We wouldn’t want him to be tarred by the same brush as Alejandro Garnacho, Rasmus Hojlund or Kobbie Mainoo, but any new list of Manchester United ‘untouchables’ would surely include him, maybe with Matthijs de Ligt and Amad Diallo, but also quite possibly him alone, with the new signings yet to prove themselves and others struggling to meet the requirements of consistent quality and youth for that label.",

      "Here’s how we’ve ranked all those who played at least 50 games since the start of Sir Alex Ferguson’s reign in 1986. Which rules out the likes of Altay Bayindir, Mark Bosnich, Massimo Taibi, Ben Foster, Ricardo, Andy Goram…",
      "",
      "We start with a keeper signed from West Brom to serve as Edwin van der Sar’s deputy; although Kuszczak had ambitions of replacing the Dutchman, it was never a likely prospect.",
      "The Poland international, capped 11 times, arrived from West Brom in 2006, by which time Van der Sar was close to turning 36. Despite staying at Old Trafford for more than five years, Van der Sar played his last game for United after Kuszczak, who saw the writing on the wall long before he was finally released in 2012, after which he accused Ferguson of holding back his career. Still, Kuszczak won three Premier League titles and a Champions League winner’s medal even if it’s hard to recall any major contribution.",
      "",
      "Romero was a stand-in at Monaco before he joined United for free to do the same job at Old Trafford. The Argentina international, with 96 caps, became United’s cup keeper for Louis van Gaal and Jose Mourinho and that role seemed to suit him.",
      "He made 61 appearances for United, keeping 39 clean sheets, while playing in the 2017 Europa League final. Romero was competent – even if some of his distribution was ropey – but was never likely to usurp De Gea, even when the Spaniard was out of form. Similar to Kuszczak, things got messy in the end, with Romero spending much of his last season away from the squad while his wife urged the club to let him go when Everton were sniffing.",
      "",
      "When it was decided that De Gea wasn’t Erik ten Hag’s type, and that United needed a more modern goalkeeper, Onana was identified as the ideal candidate. Most people agreed – indeed, the Cameroonian was expected to make a big difference to how United could build. No one can pretend there was any dissent to his signing.",
      "So we were all wrong. Has Onana made a difference to United in possession? Nope. Is that his fault? Not entirely.",
      "But it is his responsibility to stop the ball going in the net, and that fundamental task for any goalkeeper – traditional or modern – is what he has struggled with most. Onana has pulled off some great saves. But he’s dropped many a bollock. And even when he makes saves, too often they are parries back into danger. Such unpredictability is not a price worth paying for a playmaker in gloves. Which, as we now know , he’s not anyway.",
      "As this list highlights, you need to be a big character to fill the goal at Old Trafford. And Onana certainly has the necessary ego. But too much of his bravado seems misplaced. Goalkeepers need to ooze self-belief, and they can fake it to some extent when they don’t always feel it, but that assurance needs to spread throughout the team. Onana puts everyone around him on edge.",
      "Ruben Amorim has enough problems without an anxiety-inducing goalkeeper. He’s Trabzonspor’s problem now, for this season at least.",
      "",
      "Leighton was Ferguson’s first goalkeeping signing, brought in 1988 for £750,000 from Aberdeen where the pair had enjoyed great success together. The Scotland No.1 had a reasonable first season in a poor United side which finished 11th in Division One. Still, Leighton kept 14 clean sheets and conceded more than twice on only one occasion in all competitions.",
      "It all fell apart towards the end of his second campaign at Old Trafford. Ferguson was clinging to his job while United shambled their way to a 13th-placed finish. An FA Cup run saved Ferguson – but it buried Leighton.",
      "The No.1 had a poor game, one of a few in 1990, in the final with two of Crystal Palace’s three goals pinned on Leighton. Ferguson made a stunning call to drop him for the replay, bringing in Les Sealey, then on loan from Luton. It proved to be a masterstroke, with Sealey relishing his moment in the spotlight, keeping a clean sheet while Leighton looked shattered in the stands.",
      "Leighton played only once more for United – a League Cup game against Halifax at The Shay – with his relationship with Ferguson irreparably broken. “We’ve never spoken since, and never will do again,” said the keeper in 2018.",
      "It took Leighton three years before he began rebuilding his career north of the border with Hibs, where he regained his international place. Indeed, Leighton said he played the best football of his career at Easter Road before coming full circle to finish his career at Aberdeen aged 41.",
      "",
      "Carroll was signed from Wigan in 2001, initially to be back up to Fabien Barthez, with a view to perhaps one day replacing the Frenchman. That finally happened late in his second season when Ferguson lost faith in Barthez amid a title battle with Arsenal.",
      "Carroll helped get United over the line but was immediately presented with a new challenge when Tim Howard turned up. The American won the battle for the gloves in his first year but his second season saw an even contest with no outright winner.",
      "It was during that season, amid a run of 22 Premier League matches for United, that Carroll got away with fumbling Pedro Mendes’ late, long-distance hoik, a moment that is now inextricably linked with his name. More costly was a mistake in the first leg of a Champions League last-16 tie against AC Milan which prompted another rotation.",
      "Carroll left at the end of that season when Ferguson finally stopped faffing with his keepers.",
      "",
      "Few had heard of Howard when he was signed from NY/NJ Metrostars in 2003 for £2.3million. But the then-24-year-old was thrust straight into the United team with Ferguson having run out of patience with Barthez.",
      "His first season started well and all seemed to be going swimmingly until March, when Howard parried a late Porto free-kick in the Champions League last 16 to prompt Jose Mourinho’s touchline dash and kickstart the Portuguese manager’s ascent to become one of Ferguson’s main foes.",
      "After that, Howard struggled for consistent form. In 2004/05, he and Carroll auditioned for the role of United’s No. 1 but both kept fumbling their lines so the job went to Van der Sar.",
      "Howard went to become one of the Premier League’s most reliable keepers at Everton. Perhaps if he’d gone to Everton first, he’d have been ready to take the responsibility at United later in his career.",
      "",
      "Walsh is the only homegrown keeper on this list, and were it not for injuries, he might have ranked considerably higher.",
      "The Wigan-born stopper was given his debut in Ferguson’s sixth league game in charge at Old Trafford. Fergie inherited Chris Turner – and Gary Bailey, but by then injuries had taken their toll – but evidently preferred Walsh, despite the teenager’s inexperience.",
      "Walsh ended Ferguson’s first season as No.1 and began the 1987/88 season with the gloves. But a serious head injury, sustained in a mid-season friendly in Bermuda in which Ferguson brought himself on as a centre-forward, ended the youngster’s campaign, at the end of which Ferguson moved for Leighton.",
      "Walsh stuck around for seven more seasons but never threatened to regain the No.1 spot or fulfil the potential that made Fergie put an 18-year-old in his net. His final season, as one of Schemeichel’s back-ups in 1994/95, saw Walsh play the most games since his initial breakthrough, but he had to leave Old Trafford – first for Middlesbrough then Bradford – to forge a career as a No.1.",
      "",
      "Far too handsome to be a first-choice goalkeeper, Van der Gouw was a hugely reliable presence for Ferguson when he needed a back-up for Peter Schmeichel.",
      "When Schmeichel left and it quickly became clear that Bosnich wasn’t up to the job of replacing the Great Dane, Van der Gouw once again stepped in with no fuss to guard United’s goal while Ferguson tried again to find a successor to Schmeichel. That was the only season in which he made enough appearances to qualify for a title winner’s medal.",
      "Overall, in six seasons at Old Trafford, Van der Gouw managed 60 appearances. Now in his 60s, he still looks like he might do a job…",
      "",
      "",
      "A post shared by Gary Neville (@gneville2)",
      "None of what the modern goalkeeper is doing is revolutionary. Barthez was playing as an 11th outfielder at Old Trafford 25 years ago.",
      "Having failed with his initial attempts to replace Schmeichel, first with Bosnich then Taibi, Ferguson turned to Barthez in 2000. The France star, a World Cup and European Championship winner, was one of only three keepers Fergie felt could improve his team. The others: Oliver Kahn and Gianluigi Buffon. Hence why he paid Monaco £7.8million for the then 28-year-old.",
      "His first season was brilliant fun. Barthez saved penalties and quite often took the p*ss out of opposition strikers. Paolo Di Canio gave it back when he knocked United out of the FA Cup while Barthez tried to pretend he had been flagged offside, but overall, the French keeper was a huge hit.",
      "Until he wasn’t. His second season saw Barthez make more mistakes but Ferguson considered the risk to be worth the reward. In his third campaign, Fergie’s patience finally snapped and Barthez was bombed out after the defeat to Real Madrid in the Champions League. Carroll came in and Barthez was packed off back to Marseille.",
      "",
      "Sealey wasn’t United’s No.1 for a long time, but he was determined to make it a good time…",
      "His selection for the 1990 FA Cup final replay stunned everyone – especially Leighton – but Ferguson got the massive call right. “Was he a better keeper than Jim? No, but he thought he was, and that can sometimes be important.”",
      "Palace wrongly thought they could rough him up at Wembley but the brash Cockney wasn’t to be intimidated by them or the job of being Fergie’s No.1 the following season. Sealey was superb and became a Stretford End favourite. As Ferguson said, the ex-Luton veteran wasn’t the most technically accomplished stopper or the finest physical specimen. But he  defended United’s goal as if his life depended on it.",
      "It almost did. In the 1991 League Cup final, Sealey received a gash to his knee that almost went to the bone. Despite being urged to come off, the keeper was having none of it. He demanded to be strapped up and allowed to continue. Later, with an infection in the wound, he collapsed in the airport on the way back to Manchester. Had he boarded the flight, it might have cost Sealey his leg or possibly his life.",
      "Inevitably he was back, with a heavily bandaged knee, for the European Cup Winners’ Cup final against Barcelona a few weeks later, helping Ferguson to win his second trophy after playing such a huge role in the first. That summer, Schmeichel came in and Sealey departed, briefly, before Ferguson brought him back to serve as Schmeichel’s understudy.",
      "Tragically, Sealey suffered a heart attack and died seven years after leaving United for a second time in 1994.",
      "",
      "You might reasonably argue that De Gea merits a higher ranking. Some suggested in the wake of his departure in 2023 that he could be viewed as United’s best ever, with four Player of the Season awards presented as evidence.",
      "It’s a compelling argument, reinforced by his longevity. Only six players have ever played more games for United than the Spaniard they signed in 2011 from Atletico Madrid. He arrived a boy, one who didn’t look likely to be around very long, but went on to become one of the world’s best goalkeepers.",
      "But, somewhere along the line, perhaps around the time he signed that massive new deal in 2019, De Gea became outdated. He slipped from being Spain’s No.1 to being overlooked completely, while obvious flaws in his game weren’t corrected.",
      "It came to a head in 2022/23 when it became clear that De Gea wasn’t Ten Hag’s type. Still, he made some wonderful saves – dropped a few clangers too – to the point that Ten Hag seemed to feel he would be able to make do with the 32-year-old. Until the manager changed his mind and decided that replacing De Gea had become a priority during what was a huge summer. One they made a complete bollocks of.",
      "United should have handled his exit far better and only this summer did he receive the send off he deserved when he returned with Fiorentina for a pre-season friendly. That, and the fact it was the right call if clumsily processed, does not denigrate a stellar United career played out under six permanent managers. But this pair, perhaps helped by the fact they were fortunate to play in far better teams, make a better case for the top two spots…",
      "",
      "Ferguson put it best in his autobiography…",
      "‘We had a bad period trying to replace Peter Schmeichel. It’s maybe not my strong point. It wasn’t until we brought in Edwin that we got back to the level we had with Peter. Edwin was a great buy for us, absolutely brilliant. Looking back, I just wish we’d got him when Peter decided to leave.’",
      "United signed six senior keepers in the six years between Schmeichel’s departure and Van der Sar’s arrival. Perhaps that period gave the Holland international the chance to better prepare for the demands of the role. When he finally arrived, close to turning 35, he was experienced enough to handle the pressure and, frankly, make the job that so many others struggled with look a piece of p*ss.",
      "Despite his age, Van der Sar kept Fergie’s goal for six seasons, eventually retiring aged 40. The ex-Ajax, Juventus and Fulham keeper, with 130 caps, won four Premier League titles and played a huge role in winning the Champions League for United in 2008. Sure, it helped playing behind Rio Ferdinand and Nemanja Vidic, but Van der Sar was a flawless presence and a key cog in arguably Ferguson’s best-ever side.",
      "",
      "United’s best-ever keeper. Arguably the game’s greatest ever.",
      "Between 1991 and 1999, Schmeichel filled United’s goal, if not by his physical bulk then by the sheer heft of his personality. The Great Dane was a force too intimidating for many strikers, with most wilting as they raced through with only Schmeichel to beat.",
      "In those one-on-one situations, Schmeichel made mainstream the star-shaped smoother, blocking out the entire goal behind him, with arms and legs akimbo. His distribution added another new dimension to United, with an arrowed throw so long it turned opposition defences. Some other aspects of his technique were untidy but goalkeeping is an art and Schmeichel had it mastered.",
      "He kept goal throughout United’s first title under Ferguson, their first and second doubles and, of course, the Treble, bringing down the curtain on his United career with the 1999 Champions League final. Schmeichel later came to regret leaving prematurely and some may feel he tarnished his legacy somewhat by returning to the Premier League with Villa and then Manchester City. But only the most churlish United fan would view Schmeichel’s achievements any less favourably for what came after an incredible eight-season stint making United’s goal the most secure in England.",
      "Manchester United co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe ‘supported the decision’ to offload Andre Onana, which has taken the 29-year-old ‘by surprise’.",
      "Andre Onana has received a damning verdict from former Manchester United defender Paul Parker after he was a “disaster” at Old Trafford.",
      "Nottingham Forest’s decision to sack Nuno Espirito Santo has not gone down well, while we have more Florian Wirtz chat.",
      "It’s not like the Daily Mail to kick a young man when he’s down; it’s his fault that England are rubbish even in his absence.",

      "Florian Wirtz’s Liverpool start feels like déjà vu for Manchester United fans like me who remember Sebastián Verón and Shinji Kagawa at Manchester United—big reputations that fizzled under Premier League demands.",
      "Despite 10 goals and 12 assists for Leverkusen last season, Wirtz has so far delivered no goals and a single assist in two league outings, with a muted 0.34 xG per 90. Like Verón, whose technical brilliance never fully translated, and Kagawa, who shone briefly before tactical misfit dulled his influence, Wirtz looks more like a passenger than the conductor of Slot’s midfield orchestra.",
      "And before anyone says “give him time,” remember Kevin De Bruyne? He rocked up at City, scored on his first start, and finished his debut season with 16 goals and 15 assists despite missing two months injured. Some players don’t need bedding in — they just set the tempo from day one.",
      "It’s a bit like Coldplay adding a flashy new guitarist whose solos tore up small venues but don’t quite blend with the band’s stadium sound. Verón had the pedigree, Kagawa had the flair, and Wirtz has the creative CV—but in each case, the timing, chemistry, and rhythm never quite clicked.",

      "One person and one person alone is responsible for Liverpool’s ascendency to transfer market goliaths: Mikel Arteta.",
      "Let me set the scene. It’s the summer of 2024, Liverpool’s legendary manager has just rejected them and decided he would rather manage no team than spend another season managing Liverpool. The directors move swiftly to bring in their own version of Erik Ten Hag and Liverpool supporters were basically dreading the season ahead. Liverpool were primed to be sent back to the Stoneage for a Man Utd esq period of under achievement.",
      "All Arteta had to do was freshen up the attack that had clearly started to wane over the course of the previous season but the team as whole was strong. But what does he do? He decides to strengthen considerably what was already the meanest defence in the league. He spends over £100 million on a goalkeeper, a defender (who rarely played) and a midfielder (who rarely played). I know people will say Raya was an upgrade and he EVENTUALLY was but Ramsdale was a fine keeper but lacked a bit of maturity that could have been coached into him.",
      "Liverpool were there for the taking last season if any club would’ve put them under a little bit of pressure but they basically got a free ride to the title. Arteta thought that Martinelli (deplorable form for a whole season, confidence looks shot) and Jesus (perma-crock, deplorable form also) should be a core part of the Arsenal attack for the coming season. The only new attacking recruit was Sterling, whose form has been deplorable yet again for a couple of seasons. I know people say hindsight is twenty-twenty and all that but that’s just gross negligence.",
      "Arsenal inevitably wilted as the sticky part of the season hit and that Liverpool team was made to look more dominant and hell of a lot better than they actually were. They should’ve finished second or even third had there been a half-functioning Man City. And on the back of that kind of season, do you think they’re getting Wirtz and Isak, I don’t think so. Arteta deployed the usual Mourinho-esqe approach to management, winning through playing defensively so the manager gets all the credit, rather than winning with attacking flare and the players getting all the credit. This approach massively affected his transfer market priorities, with a raft of defence signings coming in. Defensively minded coaches are ego maniacs, simple as.",
      "On a brighter note, here in Sweden I would say about half of the Liverpool supporters I’ve talked to aren’t actually happy with the Isak signing, as they see him as lazy and someone who could cause problems in the dressing room. There’s one thing you can say about the Swedes and that is they’re very patriotic, they follow their national players diligently. A bad egg and lazy, wouldn’t that be nice.",
      "Also, just as a side note, why are the Saudi Pro-league paying so much on player transfers? I get why they are offering huge wages to attract the players but why are they paying over the odds for transfers? £56.6 million for Darwin Nunez ffs! No one else was paying anywhere near that for him and any club would be happy to sell players to a league that can’t possibly compete with them in European competitions. Doesn’t make sense to me.

Spurs signed players like Gareth Bale and hidden gems like Luka Modrić and Berbatov, who were doubted but ended up being world-class and made the club a ton of money.",

Perhaps he’s trying to give enough players a chance to shine in training, see if they can quickly adopt his tactics and take their chance when given a cap. With Palmer, Saka and Bellingham all missing and Foden still effectively out of form, 4 key flair players who can open up teams were missing. But he chose players like Gibbs-White and only gave him a cameo, neglected Grealish (who was great when employed as the 10 last time out for England) and the lack of invention showed.",

Almería absolutely boss the opening 20 minutes, playing some intricate football while showing good defensive organization with the full backs doing modern full back things.

Two goals within a minute of each other make it 2-2 and the ref may want to make a swift exit at full time. Almeria’s makes changes to introduce some pace. He brings on number 7, Lazaro, who goes though one on one shortly after, looks surprised to find himself in tons of space and then hits the Santander keeper so hard in the face with the ball that play is stopped. We’re still at 2-2. Then, Almería’s coach takes off Baba, the man holding the defense together and within minutes it’s 3-2.",

      "They won't shy away from that, and they feel confident they are now starting to put the fundamentals right and make inroads into the gap between them and the Premier League's best. This transfer window was the start of that.",
      "The juggernaut is at least now being steered in the right direction.",
      "United's transfer strategy this summer has been simple, strategic and is being based increasingly on data. The hierarchy at Old Trafford knows it will take several windows to get the squad to where they want it to be, and there will be some imbalance and pain in the meantime. Amorim is fully on board with that plan.",
      "Financial restrictions mean that they have had to prioritise - and it's very clear that the priority has been to make United an attacking force again, even if that means putting other positions of need on the backburner.",
      "So why have Manchester United focused on forward areas, with £207.2m spent on three players, at the expense of other positions? Director of football Jason Wilcox and his team forensically analysed the recent past. The focus was how the team performed last season, and this is the one statistic that leaps out: apart from the three relegated teams, only Everton scored fewer goals than Manchester United last season.",
      "For a club famed above all else for its attacking football and entertaining style of play, that was damning. It became an overriding priority, which is why they targeted Cunha (£62.5m), Mbeumo (£71m) and Sesko (£73.7m).",
      "Before trying to sign those three, the club analysts produced their reports, and the scouts produced theirs. Only when the two were put together - hearts and minds, if you like - did they produce a pecking order of targets.",
      "In United's eyes, those three players were the \"best in class\" for the specific roles the team needed, and they got each of them at fair market value, and on affordable salaries that are in line with the new structure.",
      "Very simply, the stats showed that in order for United to climb the table it was essential they scored more goals - and that is more important than keeping them out at the other end. If they scored the same number of goals again this season, the calculations went, it would be impossible for Manchester United to make the top six.",
      "By contrast, only Everton and Crystal Palace had better defensive records than United outside the top nine clubs in the Premier League last season. That might seem a strange statistic to most fans when you consider United conceded 54 goals in 38 matches, and had a goal difference of -10 over the season.",
      "In fact, United's defensive record last season was their third worst in the modern era - and the two that topped it, also occurred in the last five years.",
      "It would be wrong to suggest that United's recruitment team isn't aware of the defensive frailties and the need to strengthen in midfield. Rather, they identified the lack of goals as a more pressing concern, and know there is no quick fix to improving the squad as a whole.",
      "Look at United's goalkeeping targets as a case in point...",
      "Plenty of people in football will ask why, if you have one of the world's best goalkeepers available and keen to move to Old Trafford, would you turn him down and choose an unproven young stopper instead?",
      "That is the reality of United choosing Senne Lammens over Emi Martinez. The Argentina World Cup winner is without doubt one of the best in world football. But he is 33 years old. He was likely to cost over £30m. He would, quite rightly, demand a huge salary. And there would be very little value in any future fee United could demand for him, if they sold him. Exactly the same reasoning explains why United didn't choose to rival Manchester City for Gianluigi Donnarumma, one of the best goalkeepers of his generation.",
      "Instead, they went for Lammens. Not the finished article, not in the same league right now when compared to Donnarumma and Martinez. But a player who fits into the new wage structure, and who the metrics and scouts say has all the potential, with good coaching and development, to be a future Manchester United number one.",
      "Last season, he had one of the highest \"goals prevented\" statistics in Europe, made more saves than any other keeper in Europe's top 10 leagues, and proved he was good with his feet, too - making the most progressive passes for any goalkeeper under the age of 23.",
      "Just £17.3m? Half the price of Martinez? A good deal, as far as United were concerned.",
      "The club are determined to avoid the mistakes of the past, where some big-name players with big reputations ended up as expensive bench-warmers. Or worse, VIP viewers from the posh seats in the Sir Alex Ferguson stand, such has been the bloated nature of United's squad.",
      "And they are delighted that this summer has seen many of their extraneous players leave Old Trafford. Chelsea think they got a great deal for Garnacho, with a fee of £40m, but United are happy too, earning the largest sale ever for an academy player.",
      "Rashford has his entire wages covered by Barcelona for the coming season. Antony, Hojlund and Jadon Sancho are all out of the building too, which limits the external noise around the squad and the manager.",
      "There is no shying away from the fact that United have wasted big money on some big-name players who simply haven't cut it at Old Trafford in recent years.",
      "The \"bomb squad\" has cost them almost £100m in lost revenue. United paid Ajax £86m for Antony in 2022 and they have now sold him to Real Betis for £21.7m. Hojlund cost £72m from Atalanta two years ago - he is now on loan at Napoli, with an obligation for them to pay £43m for him next summer (if Napoli make the Champions League).",
      "Sancho's move to Aston Villa isn't a permanent switch, but United will recoup 80 per cent of his wages and earn a chunky loan fee. Only Tyrell Malacia remains at Carrington after the club's best efforts to move him on to Elche failed on Deadline Day.",
      "United won't shy away from the mistakes they've made in the past, and they accept that it will cost money to correct them.",
      "But this window has seen evidence of a new financial discipline, so that they hope there will be fewer expensive mistakes in the future. The fact that they weren't tempted to over-pay for Carlos Baleba - with Brighton reportedly wanting £100m for the 21-year-old - is a case in point. United like him; he fits their profile, the metrics are good... but the finances don't stack up. Hence, there was no approach.",
      "Many United fans will be questioning why the midfield wasn't deemed a priority position.",
      "Gary Neville said after the 1-1 draw with Fulham: \"In central midfield, I think United have to do a piece of business now. I would have liked to have thought that (Kobbie) Mainoo could step up and be that person, but it's quite clear that at this moment in time Amorim is not having him.\"",
      "Amorim has been key in tweaking the role of Casemiro, who he thinks is much fitter and more influential already than last season. And United see the captain Bruno Fernandes happily occupying the central midfield role alongside him for much of this season, with Cunha taking on the more advanced number 10 position.",
      "United would also point to the fact that Mainoo is yet to start a Premier League game this season, and is waiting in the wings.",
      "A young midfielder who started for England in last season's European Championship final is currently struggling to get into Amorim's starting 11.",
      "Why would you try to buy more midfielders if a player of his quality can't get in? And United are adamant they will not sell him. It was only in the final week of the window when Mainoo went to the club and asked them to explore a possible exit, frustrated as he was by the lack of game time. Mainoo was met with a categorical \"no\" and told that Amorim and United want to keep him. He is on a long contract. He is not for sale.",
      "The United project is much more evolution than revolution. It is a work in progress. This summer's transfer window wasn't perfect, but United's bosses stuck to their principles and their strategy. They are pleased with the ins and the outs.",
      "They feel they have caught up some of the ground on the clubs ahead of them. But they know there is still a long road ahead.",
      "The hope inside Old Trafford is now that, with the juggernaut plotting a more steady and sensible course, there are fewer potholes to navigate.",

      "NFL UK general manager Henry Hodgson says the league is open to exploring opportunities to play in other stadiums across the country as it continues its global expansion with a historic international slate of games.",
      "The league will host three more regular-season games across Tottenham Hotspur Stadium and Wembley Stadium in the 2025 season to take the tally of London match-ups to 42 since 2007.",
      "Such has been the sport's ascent on this side of the pond, there is an increasing appetite to enhance the game's presence beyond the capital, including the prospect of games.",
      "Football is living in historic times as it gears up for seven international games in 2025. Could Manchester United's proposed £2bn, 100,000 capacity stadium emerge as an option down the line?",
      "\"Would we look at other options? I think we'd certainly be open to those conversations. I'm very keen to make sure that we're taking the sport across the country.",
      "\"This year we have a kick-off event that's taking place in Manchester. We've got a tour going to Birmingham and to Bristol and to Cardiff. So we want to make sure that the NFL isn't seen as a London sport where we go and play games.",
      "\"We know that there are fans across the UK and we want to serve those fans across the UK. Somewhere down the road, if there are conversations to be had about that stadium or frankly any other new stadiums in the UK, we're certainly open to having those discussions. Again, for the same reason, to see how we can bring more NFL to more new people.\"",
      "Tottenham has emerged as the official home of the NFL in the UK having become the first purpose-built NFL stadium outside of the United States.",
      "Hodgson attributes its success to a long-term 'vision' of Tottenham Hotspur in accommodating the league, though accepts it can be a \"case-by-case\" basis regarding other prospective host stadiums.",
      "\"You look at the partnership we have in Tottenham, I think one of the reasons that I believe that stadium is so good is that that partnership happened long before the stadium itself started being built,\" Hodgson added.",
      "\"So it came with that as a real central part of their project. That was the vision of Daniel Levy and of Tottenham, as well as the NFL. So you'd think that that would lead people to, you know, if you were going to do it, that would be the way to go. But I'm sure different people would approach it in different ways.\"",
      "The NFL, meanwhile, remains committed to expanding its global reach, and earlier this year announced its first game in Australia at the iconic MCG.",
      "Germany is currently gearing up for its fifth regular-season game when Berlin follows in the footsteps of Frankfurt and Munich as a host city this year, while Madrid and Dublin enter as new territories.",
      "A trip to France could also be on the horizon next.",
      "\"Paris is certainly one of the cities we've looked at,\" said Hodgson. \"Everyone knows that the NFL continues to look around the world at cities that we could play games in and do that in a really considered way.",
      "\"We want to make sure that when we go and play a game, wherever it might be in the world, it's not simply for the sake of playing a game, but for growing a fanbase for the long term.",
      "\"And France certainly has a big fanbase of NFL fans existing, so Paris would lend itself as a city for us to play a game in.",
      "\"We continue to examine the opportunity to do that. And I would expect that it will happen. I think it's just a question of when. But there are a number of other cities around the world that we're looking at as well.\"",

      "\"It's an incredibly exciting year because we're playing in three new cities around the world in Madrid and in Dublin and Berlin,\" said Hodgson.",
      "\"I think for each of those there's going to be a very different atmosphere, a new set of fans who are going to get the opportunity to experience an NFL game for the very first time and a new city that's going to kind of have its own take on how to embrace the NFL.",
      "\"And then on top of that, obviously we've got games in London where the first game will be the 40th so you've got this established city.",
      "\"But I think both Dublin and Madrid are going to be really exciting, really fun, different events. Dublin, in particular, a city that really lends itself to these kind of big events and I think you're going to see the whole of Dublin overtaken by NFL fans over the weekend.\"",

The Detroit Lions loom as one of the league's most prolific offenses as the Minnesota Vikings seek to maximise a Championship-calibre roster, while Micah Parsons prepares to alter the NFC entirely after his blockbuster trade to the Green Bay Packers.",
      "\"I think the NFL's in a fantastic period of really creating some very established, very fun rivalries,\" said Hodgson. \"You look at the AFC and you've had that sort of Chiefs, Bills, Ravens triumvirate over the last few years and who's going to get there, are the Bills and Ravens finally going to get over the hump?",
      "\"I think equally with the Chiefs, even more in the spotlight given some of the recent cultural news around the NFL as well.",
      "\"You've got a lot of teams that there are question marks around but could really come up and be very exciting. Washington Commanders last year, for a few people, sort of came out of nowhere, that was exciting.",
      "\"You've got the Lions who everyone seemed to be rooting for if they weren't an Eagles fan going into the postseason. You've got the 49ers who had a bit of a down year but maybe can bounce back and then across all of it the NFL throws up those surprises.\""

Having also brought in Milos Kerkez, Jeremie Frimpong, Giorgi Mamardashvili, Hugo Etkike and Giovanni Leoni, the champions have strengthened their squad comprehensively.",
      "While Liverpool smashed the spending record, Chelsea had a record-breaking summer in terms of sales, becoming the first club to pass the £300m mark as they recouped a total of £314.4m.",
      "The Blues allowed a total of 23 players to leave the club permanently and received fees of £20m or over for nine of them. Their biggest sale was that of Noni Madueke to Arsenal for £52m, followed by that of Joao Felix to Al Nassr for £43.7m.",
      "Other sales included those of Christopher Nkunku, Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall and Djordje Petrovic, which banked Chelsea a combined £90m as they joined AC Milan, Everton and Bournemouth respectively. It should be noted, though, that, of those three, only the sale of Petrovic generated profit relative to his purchase price.",
      "Chelsea's record-breaking sales total does not include the £70.5m obligation included in Nicolas Jackson's loan move to Bayern Munich, a sum which will see the club more than double their money on the striker, signed from Villarreal for £30m in 2023.",
      "At the other end of the scale, newly-promoted Leeds were the only Premier League side not to generate any funds through sales.",
      "Both Liverpool and Chelsea spent more than Arsenal but it's the Gunners who come out top in terms of net spend having only recouped £10m in sales compared to Liverpool's £228.1m and Chelsea's record-breaking £314.4m.",
      "Arsenal did manage to trim their squad, with Fabio Vieira, Albert Sambi Lokonga, Jakub Kiwior, Reiss Nelson and Oleksandr Zinchenko joining the list of exits on Deadline Day. But generating funds through sales remains a challenge for the club.",
      "There were expiring contracts in the cases of Thomas Partey, Jorginho and Kieran Tierney, while others were only shipped out on loan. The club will recoup £24m through the obligation in Kiwior's loan to Porto, but that will come next year.",
      "The only money received in sales this summer came from Marquinhos's £2.5m move to Cruzeiro and Nuno Tavares' £7.5m exit to Lazio, leaving them with a table-topping net spend having made eight signings at a cost of £267m.",
      "The books will need to be balanced further down the line.",
      "Another trend this summer was an increase in deals between Premier League clubs. Players with experience of the competition and its unique intensity are increasingly in-demand.",
      "As recently as six seasons ago, intra-Premier League club deals were relatively rare. This summer, though, the money spent on signings between Premier League clubs topped £1bn, up from £788m last year. The pattern of the last eight campaigns suggests the trend will continue as clubs target Premier League-ready additions.",
      "More than 60 per cent of the £3.19bn spent by Premier League clubs this summer went on forwards. There was a huge scramble to add firepower led by the competition's elite sides.",
      "Liverpool added the most expensive forward of the lot with their Deadline Day move for Isak, taking their total spent on forwards to £320.5m having already signed the second and third-most expensive forwards in Wirtz and Hugo Ekitike.",
      "Manchester United also invested heavily in their front line, signing Benjamin Sesko, Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha for a combined £207m, while Arsenal and Chelsea also went big, with Viktor Gyokeres, Eberechi Eze, Joao Pedro and Liam Delap among their attacking additions.",
      "The money received by Newcastle for Isak went on Stuttgart's Nick Woltemade and Brentford's Yoanne Wissa, while other eye-catching deals saw Mohammed Kudus move from West Ham to Spurs for £55m and Dango Ouattara go from Bournemouth to Brentford for £42m. West Ham were the only Premier League side not to pay a fee for a forward in the window.",
      "It all added up to an eye-watering combined total.",
      "The scale of the spending by Premier League clubs dwarfed that of clubs in Europe's other major leagues.",
      "Italy's Serie A was the next-highest spending league but its total of £893.8m spent did not come close to the Premier League's £3.19bn.",
      "Spending in the German, Spanish and French leagues was even lower. While Premier League clubs finished with a net spend of £1.4bn, the Bundesliga and Ligue 1 registered profits.",
      "In terms of net spend, the highest-spending European clubs were Atletico Madrid, Como and Real Madrid, but their totals of £109.5m, £83m and £80.4m respectively were only comparable to mid-ranking Premier League teams.",
      "Incredibly, newly-promoted Sunderland had a net spend more than twice as high as that of Champions League winners Paris Saint-Germain's £64.9m, at £141.4m.",
      "The numbers underline the widening financial gulf between Premier League clubs and their European counterparts.",
      "Where did your club get stronger or weaker? Last week, Between the Lines broke down net spending figures by position to show the impact on the transfer window on Premier League teams.",

      "Antony, Jadon Sancho and Rasmus Hojlund all departed Manchester United on final day of summer transfer window; after fortnight of negotiations, Senne Lammens joined club in deal worth £18.2m as goalkeeper chosen over Aston VIlla's Emi Martinez",
      "Tuesday 2 September 2025 13:06, UK",
      "Manchester United finally offloaded most of their 'bomb squad' as Antony completed a permanent move to Real Betis, while Rasmus Hojlund and Jadon Sancho joined Napoli and Aston Villa on loan respectively.",
      "The club had begun Transfer Deadline Day with Antony, Hojlund, Sancho and Tyrell Malacia exiled from Ruben Amorim's squad - with only the latter remaining at Old Trafford until January at least.",
      "Antony's return to Betis ended a summer of speculation over whether he would end up back in LaLiga, having spent the second half of last season at the club and racking up seven goal contributions in 17 games.",
      "He joined them for £21.7m, a loss of £64m from when Man Utd paid Ajax £86m for him in 2022.",
      "Jadon Sancho, who had been a target for Roma, joined Villa as one of a number of late additions to Unai Emery's squad, with Rasmus Hojlund making a temporary move, which could become permanent, to Napoli, who have been seeking further striking reinforcements all summer.",
      "Few incomings were expected after Brighton rejected an offer for Carlos Baleba last month, with Senne Lammens the only arrival in an attempt to solve the ongoing goalkeeping issues at Old Trafford.",
      "Andre Onana has not featured for Man Utd in the league all season and was at fault for one of Grimsby's goals in their shock Carabao Cup defeat last week, with Altay Bayindir also faltering in his place in United's opening three Premier League games.",
      "Lammens joined from Royal Antwerp on a five-year deal for a fee of around £18.2m, including add-ons. Aston Villa's Emi Martinez had been discussed, but it was decided internally that Lammens was a better option.",
      "Lammens' skill as a shot-stopper was what impressed the club most; no goalkeeper made more saves in Europe's top 10 leagues last season and he had one of the highest goals prevented metrics in Europe. He also made the most progressive passes for any goalkeeper under the age of 23.",
      "As it stands, United are expected to move forward with four goalkeepers, adding Lammens to their current group of Bayindir, Onana and Tom Heaton.",

      "In the end, he got his wish - but he had to wait right up to the end of the transfer window for it to happen. He leaves Old Trafford having played 62 Premier League games across three seasons, but contributed just eight goals and assists.",
      "He arrived at the club in 2022 as one of the major signings of the summer, following former boss Erik ten Hag from Ajax, but never managed to recreate his Eredivisie form for United.",
      "A number of clubs had been interested in bringing in Sancho this summer, including Chelsea, where he spent last season on loan and featured heavily in their run to the Conference League title. But, having failed to agree terms with the Blues, he returned to Old Trafford - and they paid a £5m fine as per the terms of his loan.",

      "Monday 1 September 2025 23:01, UK",

      "As it stands, United will move forward with four goalkeepers, adding Lammens to their current group of Altay Bayindir, Andre Onana and Tom Heaton.",

      "\"He's very calm. The mentality is good, I've spoken to goalkeeping coaches and he's been seen as a rising star in Belgium for quite a while.",
      "\"He was at Club Brugge and couldn't get past Simon Mignolet, who was in excellent form. He went to Antwerp, and the number of shots he's saving beyond what the expected goals would expect him to concede has been very, very high.",
      "\"Antwerp have one of the best defensive records in Belgium last season. But it's a huge leap to be the No 1 at Manchester United.",

      "Super 6 are starting the season by guaranteeing a £1,000,000 winner! Play for free.",
      "Lammens boasts some striking statistics last season, some simple and others complex. He saved four penalties in the Belgian league, twice as many as anyone else, and his total of 173 saves was the most of any goalkeeper in the top eight leagues.",
      "Given that information, it is perhaps not so surprising that the advanced metrics also suggest he was the outstanding performer. Based on the expected-goals data, he prevented half a goal every 90 minutes - more than any other keeper in Europe.",
      "He has earned a reputation as a ball-playing goalkeeper with a real range of passes at his disposal, although the statistics suggest he is not quite so accustomed to rushing off his line as regularly as some of the more high-profile sweeper-keepers around.",
      "In Belgium, his list of admirers include former national team goalkeepers Michel Preud'homme and Simon Mignolet but the step up to playing for Manchester United will still be a test of technique and temperament for this talented 23-year-old prospect.",
      "\"If your goalkeeper is making mistakes, it undermines everything that you do. And at Old Trafford, it's the most unforgiving ground for goalkeepers.",
      "\"The Manchester United goalkeeper spot is the toughest position in English football, bar none. If you give goals away at United as a keeper, you'll be scrutinised heavily.",
