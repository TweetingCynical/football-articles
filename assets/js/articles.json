      "Ruben Amorim left Kobbie Mainoo on the bench during his time in charge(Image: Getty)",
      "Kobbie Mainoo's resurgence under the management of Michael Carrick at Manchester United should be embarrassing for Ruben Amorim, according to Ian Wright. Mainoo was left on the sidelines during Amorim's spell in charge but has been a key part of United's turn around in form under Carrick.",
      "United's 2-0 win over Tottenham on Saturday made it four in succession since Carrick was made interim manager last month. Mainoo has played 90 minutes in all four of Carrick's games in charge, helping them beat Manchester City, Arsenal, Fulham and Spurs to solidify fourth place in the Premier League.",
      "When Amorim was still around, the 20-year-old United academy graduate had been agitating for a transfer in January window, with Napoli keen on signing him. But the Portuguese manager's sacking on January 5 changed everything for him, with two assists and some telling contributions coming over the last month.",
      "Former Arsenal and England striker Wright has always been a fan of Mainoo and believes that, while his recent form is a boost to Carrick's reputation, it should also damage Amorim's. \"Everybody was confused with what was happening under Ruben Amorim,\" Wright said on the Premier League World Show after the win over Spurs.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UTD FB PAGE! Latest United news and more on our dedicated Facebook page",
      "\"When you look at (Mainoo), someone who's not played, coming into a Man United side that's not in great form. To play in that midfield which is where all the questions have been around... just the quality.",
      "\"You're listening to Bruno [Fernandes] saying they've been given the freedom to express themselves because they're good players. And Kobbie is a very, very good player. I'm just pleased we're seeing that now.",
      "\"I think it's very embarrassing for Ruben Amorim if we're going to be totally honest. Because what we seen was a Man United youth product not given the opportunity to play and very, very close to leaving the club.\"",
      "Kobbie Mainoo has thrived under Michael Carrick(Image: Mike Morese/Getty Images)",
      "Mainoo wanted to join Napoli - and his former United team-mate Scott McTominay - in January, having grown frustrated by his status as a substitute under Amorim. The former manager's love of the 3-4-3 formation left him on the bench, with Casemiro and Fernandes in central midfield, but Carrick has made him a fixture alongside the Brazilian in a 4-2-3-1 formation.",
      "\"There's no doubt about Kobbie's ability and what he can bring,\" Carrick said after goals from Bryan Mbeumo and Fernandes saw off 10-man Spurs. \"He's still so young and learning the game. He has had the big high and then not playing for a bit. It is easier to think he is older than he is.\",",
      "Mainoo's ultimate goal is to earn a place in Thomas Tuchel's squad for the World Cup in the United States, Canada and Mexico this summer. He has not played for England since 2024 and faces an uphill battle to dislodge one of Tuchel's favourites in central midfield before the tournament begins on June 11.",

      "Bryan Mbeumo has now scored ten goals in all competitions for Manchester United this season(Image: James Gill/Danehouse)",
      "It was not his cleanest strike but it was a game-changer and one that brought wide smiles to Michael Carrick and his coaching staff. And the set-piece special gave Bryan Mbeumo his third goal in four games under Carrick. He is certainly enjoying life under the man who is, for now, only a short-term manager.",
      "Carrick has now celebrated four victories, his side scoring ten goals in the process. In their previous four Premier League games, Manchester United had won only one, scoring five goals in the process.",
      "It certainly looks like a quite spectacular resurgence but Mbeumo believes it is not as dramatic as most people like to make out. Mbeumo clearly believes they were making some sort of progress under Ruben Amorim.",
      "He explains: “I just feel we built on what we were doing from the start because I don't think it was that bad as a lot of people felt. We just work together, make the effort together, with a big mentality, and we're never beaten. Even if someone gets past, we come back to support and just try to give it our all.”",
      "Mbeumo now has ten goals in all competitions since his £71million move from Brentford in the summer and his latest effort came from a short-corner routine that was, in part, the training-ground work of Jonny Evans. Carrick praised Evans for his work but Mbeumo admitted things did not quite go to plan when they first tried it out.",
      "Mbeumo said: “It was Jonny Evans who was coming to me and the guys and we just tried to hit it. We did it once but it didn't work out. But this one was the most important.”",
      "Mbeumo struck soon after Spurs skipper Cristian Romero had been sent off and his goal sparked another carnival-style occasion at Old Trafford that ended with Bruno Fernandes sealing victory. The feelgood factor is definitely back.",
      "Michael Carrick has won all four of his games in this stint as Manchester United manager(Image: Marc Atkins/Getty Images)",
      "The Cameroon striker smiled: “The fans are a massive community and we feel that when we get onto the pitch. We want to make them happy, so we just try to use their energy that they give us and try to give our best.”",
      "Mbeumo is clearly determined not to get carried away with United’s fine run of form. And the same goes for his manager.",
      "Apart from the odd moment or two, Carrick cuts a calm and composed figure in the technical area, despite the excitement of four victories on the spin. He is certainly no Pep Guardiola in his level of animation.",
      "Carrick explained: “I think it's just managing the moment. I'm not particularly thinking I need to look a certain way. I’m not into that. It's not a performance for me.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo's opener against Spurs came from a slick short-corner routine(Image: Marc Atkins, Getty Images)",
      "“I think it helps make clear decisions. It’s trying to understand how the game's going on. There's certainly an emotional side, you know.",
      "“I’ve made myself look a little bit silly with some of the celebrations from certain goals that we've had, but that's part of football, and you've got to enjoy the moments at certain times. But there's definitely another bit of trying to be calm and thoughtful and calculate it at the right time as well.”",
      "His calm and thoughtful approach is certainly paying dividends and that is the way in which he is determined to carry on, saying: “We're not getting carried away. I'm certainly not thinking everything's great. We've cracked it, you know? There's a lot of work to do, so I'm fully aware of that.”",

      "Kobbie Mainoo has played every minute of Michael Carrick's four games as Manchester United manager(Image: Getty Images)",
      "As well-executed as it was, the short-corner routine that gave Manchester United the lead really should not be working against professional defences. It looked clever because it produced a goal, of course. It was fairly basic stuff, though, that was successful mainly because Spurs players somehow failed to see it coming or react.",
      "But those Spurs players were not the first - and won’t be the last - to be fooled by the excellence of Kobbie Mainoo. Somehow, they did not notice Mainoo nipping away from the front post to receive the kick before reversing a pass to Bryan Mbeumo that the United forward scuffed past Guglielmo Vicario.",
      "And that is Mainoo. So much of what he does well goes unnoticed. There is nothing flashy. He is undemonstrative.",
      "There is no finger-pointing, no arm-waving. He is no shrinking violet but he tends not to get involved in many spats.",
      "Among those who did not notice Mainoo’s strengths was Ruben Amorim. Either it was one of those inexplicable blind spots that a manager can have or Amorim saw something that he didn’t quite like.",
      "Because Mainoo would give midfield balance to any elite team. Reinstated to the team, Mainoo has been quietly efficient in Michael Carrick’s perfect four-game run.",
      "And what Carrick sees is the perfect combination of a 20-year-old still on a learning curve yet one already with invaluable experiences in his locker. Don’t forget, Mainoo started a European Championship final. He scored a goal in an FA Cup final.",
      "“There’s definitely more to come from him but he also has so much experience under his belt,” says Carrick. “He has experience of big occasions, big games, of pressurised situations. He's having a really big impact on games and we'll keep working with him and helping him, try and keep improving him as well as we go along.”",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UTD FB PAGE! Latest United news and more on our dedicated Facebook page",
      "Michael Carrick has made the perfect start as Manchester United manager(Image: Marc Atkins/Getty Images)",
      "While the likes of Bruno Fernandes has been outstanding in United’s resurgence, the midfield combination of Mainoo and Casemiro has been at the heart of the revival. The pair have been outstanding.",
      "“That is going to help him develop,” Carrick explains. “Playing next to Case, learning from him, learning things he’s probably not even realising he is picking up. I think that is just part of his journey to learn and develop.",
      "“He's at the stage he's at in his career when he's just starting out, essentially. But he’s come in, he's played four games, and he's found his rhythm.”",
      "And in only four games - the latest win courtesy of the Mbeumo goal and a late Fernandes effort, both after Cristian Romero’s first-half, game-changing red card - Carrick has already made a compelling case to be given the long-term manager’s job. Quite simply, he has transformed the mood at the club.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo scored Manchester United's opener against Spurs with Kobbie Mainoo providing the assist(Image: Marc Atkins, Getty Images)",
      "He says: “I think we have just come in with our beliefs, how we see things, principles, and asking the players to do certain things and behave in a certain way. And it's difficult to comment in terms of what's changed. I'm pleased with the buy-in, with the connection. Everyone's invested in it. I think that goes a long way.",
      "“The game can flow in different ways and you can look very different, good or bad, but I think being in a really good emotional place helps you.”",
      "And right now, under Carrick, everyone at Old Trafford is certainly in a really good emotional place. Particularly Kobbie Mainoo.",

      "Scott McTominay featured for Napoli this weekend(Image: Image Photo Agency, Getty Images)",
      "Scott McTominay experienced a rollercoaster of emotions during Napoli's 3-2 victory over Genoa on Saturday. The former Manchester United star scored an impressive goal for the Serie A champions, only to be sidelined by an injury at half-time.",
      "Napoli found themselves trailing after an early penalty but McTominay played a key role in levelling the score, with his shot rebounding for United loanee Rasmus Hojlund to tap home. The Scotland international then stole the show, scoring a spectacular long-range effort just two minutes later.",
      "However, the 29-year-old was withdrawn at half-time due to an injury, much to the dismay of manager Antonio Conte. Genoa equalised before the hour mark, capitalising on a defensive mistake, and Napoli's grip on the game seemed to be slipping when Juan Jesus was shown a red card with just 15 minutes left on the clock.",
      "In McTominay's absence, it was Hojlund who emerged as the hero, securing three points for his side with a last-minute penalty that slipped under the goalkeeper. After the match, Napoli's boss Conte gave an update on McTominay's injury.",
      "\"Scott has been dealing with this problem since the beginning of the year,\" he said. \"It's an inflammation of the tendons in the area between the gluteus maximus and the hamstrings. This discomfort forces him to play at a reduced pace.",
      "\"He would have continued, but at the end of the first half I preferred to avoid any stupid risks. We're talking about a key player for us, I need him to be 100%. We hope to get him back as soon as possible.\"",
      "Despite featuring for just 45 minutes, McTominay's impact proved crucial to a result that left Napoli six points adrift of Serie A leaders Inter Milan. Here's how the Italian press assessed the former United man's display.",
      "Praised for his involvement in Napoli's opening goal by \"Prince Rasmus\", McTominay received plaudits for \"a magnificent moral brace\". Il Napolista awarded the midfielder an eight out of 10.",
      "Antonio Conte addressed McTominay's injury(Image: Isabella BONOTTO / AFP via Getty Images)",
      "His willingness to play through injury drew comparisons to Braveheart. Wishing McTominay a swift return to fitness, the summary of his performance ended with the line: \"God save Scott McTominay.\"",
      "The Italian publication handed McTominay an eight for his efforts while playing through discomfort. Corriere dello Sport summed up the midfielder's character: \"When the going gets tough, he's always the toughest.\"",
      "His strike was described as \"beautiful\" and his overall performance was \"exceptional\". The way he continued to \"shoot, run and fight like hell\" saw him labelled the \"Rocky of football\".",
      "McTominay and Rasmus Hojlund were vital to Napoli's win over Genoa(Image: Isabella BONOTTO / AFP via Getty Images)",
      "This Italian outlet acknowledged that McTominay's fitness issues affected his performance. Il Messaggero characterised the team's key midfielder as \"not being at his best\", though they praised his determination to continue.",
      "Instead of highlighting his long-distance attempt, it was his contribution to Hojlund's equaliser that was noted as \"a precise right-footed shot\". He received a seven in the outlet's player ratings.",

      "Marcus Rashford has earned praise from Spanish media after seizing his chance in a rare league start for Barcelona. Hansi Flick's side stretched their advantage at the top of La Liga to four points following a 3-0 triumph over Mallorca at the Nou Camp.",
      "With Rafinha sidelined through injury, Rashford was given his first league start since January 3 and grasped the opportunity with both hands. Robert Lewandowski broke the deadlock in the 29th minute after a Rashford shot was blocked.",
      "Lamine Yamal, finding the net for a fifth consecutive match, added a second just past the hour mark before fellow youngster Marc Bernal sealed the win with his maiden senior goal seven minutes from the final whistle.",
      "However, it was Rashford that garnered most of the plaudits from the media and supporters, who gave the on-loan Manchester United attacker a standing ovation when he was withdrawn midway through the second period.",
      "Mundo Deportivo described Rashford's display as \"hyperactive\" and commended him for energising Barca after a lethargic opening. They wrote: \"By far, one of Barca's most purposeful players in a first half that was collectively very flat.",
      "\"Taking Flick's challenge to heart, he assumed attacking responsibility when the game looked its worst, producing the most dangerous shots, the second leading to the 1-0 goal, and sending a beautiful free kick straight off the crossbar. Substituted to well-deserved applause.\"",
      "El Desmarque, referencing the side's sluggish opening, lauded both Rashford and Yamal for rousing Barca \"from their siesta\". AS also commended Rashford, while noting he enjoyed greater freedom compared to Yamal, who was \"constantly facing a three-on-one on the right flank\". They additionally observed that \"Rashford's form has improved throughout the season\".",
      "Rashford took his chance with both hands(Image: Josep LAGO/AFP via Getty Images)",
      "The Barca Universal website awarded Rashford an impressive 8.5/10 rating, stating: \"Rashford was perhaps Barcelona's most potent threat in the first half as he did not hesitate to cut in and shoot, creating a ruckus in the Mallorca area and bombarding Roman's goal with powerful strikes.",
      "\"He also did well providing a wide threat, although his crosses were well defended for the greater part. In fact, the opening goal stemmed from his shot on goal which fell kindly for Lewandowski.\"",
      "Rashford impressed both fans and media with his performance(Image: Pablo Rodriguez/Quality Sport Images/Getty Images)",
      "Football Espana weren't quite as generous with their marks, handing him a 7/10 while still delivering glowing praise: \"Barcelona's best attacker, and he can count himself unlucky that he did not find the back of the net with one of his ferocious strikes.\"",
      "Meanwhile, Barca Blaugranes suggested the Catalan giants stirred into life \"thanks in large part to Marcus Rashford, who was the brightest and most active of the Blaugrana attackers\".",

      "There are doubts over Bruno Fernandes's Manchester United future(Image: Getty Images)",
      "Bruno Fernandes has contributed a staggering sum in tax over the past year amid uncertainty over his Manchester United future. The club skipper, who pockets around £300,000 weekly, ranks among Britain's highest taxpayers.",
      "In the last 12 months alone, he's handed over approximately £9million to the Treasury, according to the recently published Sunday Times Tax List. His substantial earnings reflect his status as arguably United's most dependable performer throughout a turbulent period for the club, which has seen a succession of managers come and go.",
      "Reports suggest Fernandes has become weary of the constant turmoil, with fellow Portuguese Ruben Amorim becoming the latest manager to be axed. The midfielder has previously considered a switch to the Saudi Pro League, but rejected a move to the Gulf state last summer.",
      "Fresh offers are almost certain to arrive this summer, though supporters will be hoping the resurgence under Michael Carrick can persuade the 31-year-old to remain at Old Trafford. His contract runs until summer 2027, with a 12-month extension option. Yet the financial attractions of relocating to Saudi Arabia are clear.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UTD FB PAGE! Latest United news and more on our dedicated Facebook page",
      "Beyond the enormous wages on offer, footballers pay no tax on their income in the kingdom. This contrasts sharply with the 45 per cent levy on earnings above £125,000 in Britain.",
      "While he perhaps couldn't dream of matching Cristiano Ronaldo's eye-watering £3.74m weekly earnings, a pay packet hovering around the £1m mark wouldn't be unrealistic. Take Karim Benzema and Riyad Mahrez, for example, who both pocket more than £800,000 a week.",
      "Fernandes isn't even the biggest tax contributor at United. That is Casemiro, a player who's certain to depart the club come summer.",
      "Fernandes is likely to be in demand again this summer(Image: CameraSport via Getty Images)",
      "The Brazilian midfielder commands a staggering £375,000 per week according to the Sunday Times list, which means he's forked out nearly £11m in tax over the past year.",
      "That places him as the third-highest taxpayer in British football, trailing only Manchester City's Erling Haaland (£17m) and Liverpool's Mohamed Salah (£14.5m).",
      "Casemiro is getting ready to leave English football after contributing a huge amount to the public purse(Image: John Walton/PA Wire)",
      "Raheem Sterling, who recently parted ways with Chelsea by mutual agreement, contributed £9.8m in tax - £100,000 more than Liverpool's Virgil van Dijk.",
      "Fernandes matches City's Bernardo Silva on £9m. Topping the overall tax list was bookmaker Betfred, which handed over £400m to the Treasury. Music stars Harry Styles and Ed Sheeran, along with boxer Anthony Joshua, also feature in the top 100.",

      "Bruno Fernandes sent a message to Cole Palmer",
      "Bruno Fernandes has reached out to Cole Palmer following Chelsea's impressive 3-1 victory over Wolves, where the forward bagged a stunning hat-trick. Palmer rediscovered his goal-scoring touch in what has been an injury-hit campaign thus far.",
      "The 23-year-old netted all three goals for Chelsea during the opening 45 minutes at Molineux, showcasing the devastating impact he can have on proceedings. Throughout his debut campaign at Stamford Bridge, Palmer found the net 27 times across all competitions, secured numerous individual accolades, and cemented his place in the England squad.",
      "His displays even triggered speculation about a potential move during the January transfer window, with rumours suggesting Manchester United were interested amid suggestions he was experiencing homesickness.",

      "Whilst Chelsea manager Liam Rosenior refuted those claims, it's evident that people at United have been monitoring his development closely.",
      "Fernandes appeared in the comments section of Palmer's Instagram post following the fixture, where the Chelsea ace uploaded several images from the match with the caption: \"Just enjoy.\"",
      "The Portuguese captain responded: \"What a player,\" accompanied by a clapping emoji. His remark swiftly accumulated over 3,900 likes and hundreds of responses.",
      "Some supporters playfully labelled him \"agent Bruno,\" whilst another commented: \"I see what you're doing here, mate.\"",
      "Kobbie Mainoo and Marcus Rashford, presently on loan at Barcelona from United, also liked the post. Palmer has openly admitted to being a United supporter in his youth, despite honing his skills at the academy of their city rivals. He has also confessed to idolising United icon Wayne Rooney during his formative years.",
      "Cole Palmer scored a first-half hat-trick for Chelsea against Wolves (Image: Ben Roberts Photo, Getty Images)",

      "\"He's played a lot of football over the last year with not much rest. When he's at his best, he's unstoppable. I'm delighted to be working with him.\"",
      "However, post-match, Palmer addressed the recent rumours surrounding his future, telling the BBC: \"Everyone loves to chat rubbish, don't they? I don't pay too much attention to it.",

      "Michael Carrick celebrates after Manchester United's win against Spurs(Image: Getty Images)",
      "Saturday lunchtime brought a fourth win in as many matches for Michael Carrick since he took over as Manchester United interim manager. Opponents Tottenham Hotspur made things difficult for themselves when captain Cristian Romero was sent off in the first half but United still had work to do.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo took advantage, rolling home United's opener a few minutes before half time. It wasn't until the final 10 minutes that the points were made safe thanks to a Bruno Fernandes effort but Carrick won't be complaining too much.",
      "There's now a chance for the Red Devils to make it five league wins on the spin when they take on West Ham on Tuesday. The Hammers took a point at Old Trafford before Christmas but will go into the midweek meeting in the bottom three.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UTD FB PAGE! Latest United news and more on our dedicated Facebook page",
      "Before the turn of the year, Kobbie Mainoo could barely get a look in at Manchester United. Ruben Amorim preferred to use Bruno Fernandes in a deeper role alongside Casemiro, meaning the England international had to make do with occasional cameos from the bench.",
      "Things have changed under Michael Carrick, though, with Fernandes pushed forward and Mainoo brought into the starting XI in a 4-2-3-1 set-up. He has barely missed a minute under the interim boss, starting four games out of four and playing another 90 minutes against Spurs before making way for Tyler Fletcher in second-half stoppage time.",
      "Kobbie Mainoo impressed again on Saturday(Image: Getty Images)",
      "The midfielder feels undroppable right now, with Hargreaves speaking about a \"perfect\" midfield balance. \"Kobbie, for him not to play for a year and come and play like this is amazing. I think [he and Casemiro] complete each other,\" he said.",
      "When Manchester United brought Jonny Evans into their first-team coaching staff, former captain Roy Keane questioned the decision. The former centre-back was brought in to work with caretaker Darren Fletcher after Ruben Amorim was sacked and has remained in place since Michael Carrick's appointment.",
      "\"It's not an issue with Jonny Evans, it's an issue with the club and the decision-making, who they're bringing in,\" Keane said, pointing to the Northern Irishman's lack of experience in the coaching environment. However, Carrick singled out Evans for the part he played in United's opener on Saturday to leave the one-time skipper with egg on his face.",
      "Manchester United have been among the most dangerous teams from set pieces in the Premier League this season. However, they still have some way to go to catch league leaders Arsenal in that regard.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Chelsea star Cole Palmer has dismissed speculation linking him with a departure from the club, after the Blues' talisman netted a first-half hat-trick against Wolves, but has admitted that he's noticed the talk.",
      "The England international bagged all of Chelsea's goals in the 3-1 triumph at Molineux. His opening two strikes came from the penalty spot, as the Blues maintained their impressive run under Liam Rosenior.",
      "After converting his first spot-kick, Palmer opted against his trademark 'cold' celebration and instead sprinted towards the travelling supporters with his hands covering his ears, before blowing a kiss to the travelling Chelsea faithful.",
      "The gesture follows claims that he was experiencing homesickness and was prepared to return to Manchester with boyhood outfit Manchester United. However, Palmer now seems to have dispelled those rumours.",
      "Speaking to BBC Match of the Day following the victory, he explained: \"Everyone loves to chat rubbish, don't they? I don't pay too much attention to it.",
      "\"You see things. But I feel like I've come from a strong place anyway so I don't pay attention to it.\"",

      "\"Lets us be ourselves, play free. I'm sure when I'm back proper fit you'll see the best of me. Him and all the staff give us all confidence on the training pitch, with his strategies, the way we play... I really like it.\"",
      "Palmer's campaign has been plagued by fitness issues, with him sidelined for 21 matches across all competitions this term. He has, though, appeared in the previous four fixtures in all competitions, getting the nod in the last two Premier League outings.",
      "He offered a revealing acknowledgement regarding his condition. \"I don't think [I'm 100% fit] just yet,\" he said.",
      "\"Obviously people don't know what goes on behind the scenes but being injured the whole season is not ideal and when I'm not able to perform as I want to because I've been injured, and still dealing with the injury, but hopefully I can get over the injury soon by managing it. I know what level I can provide when I feel 100% fit.",

      "In conversation with Chelsea's official site, Palmer continued: \"I've never been injured before in my career. This is something new to me, and I'm still finding out how to deal with it.",
      "\"It has been frustrating, I don't feel like I've played a game this season fully fit. I've been going into games thinking, 'Can I do certain things? Can I not?' Overthinking it.",

      "\"I'm not here to make excuses, and ''ll get over the injuries. I know what I can do when I'm fit, and hopefully I can get back to that soon. For now, I just manage it and get there.\"",

      "Kobbie Mainoo has played 90 minutes in each of the last four games(Image: Getty Images)",
      "Michael Carrick believes there is ‘more to come’ from Kobbie Mainoo as his Manchester United renaissance rolls on. The midfielder looked set to have little future at Old Trafford under former boss Ruben Amorim having fallen out of contention under the Portuguese coach.",
      "He was even linked with a move away from the club, Italian side Napoli among those interested in him. But Mainoo is now firmly back in the fold at United, having played 90 minutes in each of the last four games.",
      "And it appears Carrick is a big fan, tipping Mainoo for a bright future. Speaking after Saturday’s 2-0 win vs Spurs, he said: “There’s definitely more to come from him, that’s just the age he’s at, the stage he’s at in his career you’d like to think, he’s just starting out really essentially. He has got so much experience under his belt in big games and pressured situations, which is going to help him develop learning the game.",
      "“Playing next to Case [Casmiro] and learning off him, things that he’s probably not even realising he’s picking things up just by being next to him, as well as the other players around him, I think that’s just part of his journey to learn and develop.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UTD FB PAGE! Latest United news and more on our dedicated Facebook page",
      "“I’m really conscious that he’s come in, he’s played the four games and he’s found his rhythm. Young players, they have times when they’re up and then they might have a little dip. That’s not all of a sudden he’s good or he’s a poor player, Kobbie is what he is.",
      "“Managing that’s really important, especially for younger players and understanding that. He’s doing fantastic at the moment, he’s having a really big impact on games, and we’ll keep working with him and helping him, trying to keep improving him as well as we go.",
      "Asked how Mainoo has overcome a challenging season to re-establish himself as a key player at United, Carrick replied: “There’s no doubt of Kobbie’s ability and what he can bring, he’s still so young and let’s be careful of not putting so much right on his shoulders and expecting so much of him. He’s still learning the game.",
      "Mainoo is now firmly back in contention at Manchester United(Image: Getty Images)",
      "“Because he’s had the big high and then obviously didn’t play for a bit, it’s easy to think he’s a lot older and more experienced probably than he is. But credit to him, he’s come right in and find his rhythm with football, which is not easy after a period of time out and he’s found that physically and mentally.",
      "“We know he can handle the ball and hopefully over time, I’m sure he’ll keep improving. We’ve got to be patient and not expect too much from him all the time.”",

      "Sancho, 25, finally chalked up his first Premier League goal contribution at the weekend as he teed-up Morgan Rogers for Villa’s opener against Bournemouth. While Emery has claimed that he is improving, the Spaniard has said that he wants to see even more from the United forward.",

      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UTD FB PAGE! Latest United news and more on our dedicated Facebook page",
      "Sancho was then sent to Chelsea last term, with the Blues having agreed to a £25m obligation to buy, albeit the Blues paid £5m to back out of that agreement. Sancho's current United deal expires this summer and is yet to put pen to paper on a new deal with the Red Devils.",
      "Elsewhere, Sancho is not the only one of his Villa stars that Emery has sent a message to. Brazilian midfielder Douglas Luiz re-joined the side on loan from Juventus in January despite reported interest from Chelsea.",

      "Romero has to take a huge slice of the blame for Spurs' defeat to Man United(Image: Getty Images)",
      "“We only had 11 players available - unbelievable but true and disgraceful.” Cristian Romero, after the stirring Spurs comeback against Manchester City last Sunday.",
      "And after less than half an hour in their next game, Tottenham Hotspur, on the pitch, only had 10 players available - unbelievable but true and disgraceful.",
      "That Manchester United’s revival under Michael Carrick continued with a fourth win on the spin was down to their renewed vibrancy, a couple of bits of clever finishing and an incisive, more direct, attacking style.",
      "But it was also down to the stupidity of Romero, to his entirely predictable loss of control. After the Argentinian defender’s social media post laying into the Spurs hierarchy in the week, manager Thomas Frank said the matter would be dealt with internally but that Romero would remain captain.",
      "And he did. Remained Captain Liability, that is. From the moment the 50-50 situation with Casemiro developed, there was only ever going to be one outcome.",
      "Michael Oliver’s red card was on its way out before Romero’s right boot had crunched into Casemiro’s ankle. A minority could probably argue it was a little harsh but the force left Oliver with little choice but to give Romero his fourth Premier League red card.",
      "Those cards have come against United, City, Chelsea and Liverpool. He loves a big game dismissal, Cristian. That is two reds and nine yellows this season. Some going.",
      "And this particular transgression - which, it has to be said, was not that much worse than Diogo Dalot’s yellow-card offence against Jeremy Doku here - definitely gave United a helping hand they probably did not need.",
      "Lifted by their man-advantage, a clever corner-kick routine - finished by Bryan Mbeumo - put them ahead and they never looked in any trouble from that point.",
      "Romero was sent off for a crunching challenge on Casemiro(Image: Getty Images)",
      "This was, by no means, a scintillating performance but there is a positivity about Old Trafford that makes the long-term appointment of Carrick seem increasingly like an obvious decision.",
      "The resurgence under him should be no surprise. This is a good United squad, expensively assembled and in rude health. The workload is very easily manageable and the overall standard of this season’s Premier League is of dubious quality.",
      "This was United’s 27th game of the season, ten fewer than Spurs have had to play. The decisiveness of that factor cannot be underestimated. More games does not just mean more fatigue, it means more injuries.",
      "United only have 13 matches to tackle in the remaining 15 weeks of the season. With the resources at his disposal, Carrick could rotate selection if he wished but there is no need. If this eleven stays fit, he could play it for the rest of the season.",
      "He might make a few changes for Tuesday’s trip to West Ham but this set-up has a winning way about it and should have made the scoreline more convincing against the Tottenham ten.",
      "Bruno Fernandes has been in brilliant form for Man United(Image: Getty Images)",
      "Unlike during their recent away trip to Burnley, the travelling Spurs support did not turn on Frank, presumably because Spurs were playing well before Romero decided to earn himself a four-game suspension.",
      "As reckless as he can be, the centre-half will still be missed and personnel issues continue to undermine Frank. There are no such issues for Carrick, who has not only found a system that suits his players but is also getting the best out of individuals.",
      "The agreement for Casemiro and the club to part ways at the end of the season is looking more hasty with every game the Brazilian plays under Carrick.",
      "The midfield combination of Casemiro, Kobbie Mainoo and Bruno Fernandes is purring. There are still suggestions Fernandes might also leave in the summer but, from United’s point of view, it would be madness to let him leave.",
      "For another outstanding contribution, he deserved his goal late in proceedings. And if Romero was still watching, this is what a captain’s performance looks like.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "United are the strongest team from set-pieces this season, having recorded the highest number of goals scored per 100 set-plays. Arsenal have earned a reputation as being prolific from set-pieces, but United have a better record from fewer of them, and they scored from a beautiful routine against Spurs.",

      "It's understood set-pieces are a collective responsibility among the current coaching staff, however, perhaps Kaita Hasgawa deserves another mention for doing important work behind the scenes.",
      "Amorim namedropped Hasgawa as someone who deserved praise for improving set-pieces and helping to tactically prepare for the opponent. Hasegawa's position has not been described as senior, but he was recruited from Everton after seven years in Merseyside, and is thought to play an important role.",

      "The Romero red card changed the complexion of the game. The contest had flowed well and Tottenham looked dangerous, but Romero could have no complaints when Michael Oliver showed him a straight red.",
      "The challenge on Casemiro was reckless and the Brazilian looked in a world of pain when he slumped to the turf. Thomas Frank tried to reason with the fourth official, but had no serious case to overturn it.",
      "The Stretford End chanted Casemiro's name while he received treatment, but their attention turned to Romero as he returned to the dressing room. \"Cheerio, cheerio, cheerio,\" fans taunted as Romero walked off.",
      "Romero slammed Tottenham's board for their lack of investment when the January transfer window closed, but the Spurs captain only had himself to blame for his side's defeat.",
      "The classy Munich tributes",
      "It was the 68th anniversary of the Munich Air Disaster on Friday. United held a memorial service at Old Trafford, and there were further tributes from fans in the Stretford End before the Totttenham game.",
      "United fans unfurled a \"Busby Babes\" banner in the upper tier of the stand, which was followed by a \"we'll never die\" banner being unfurled in the lower tier. Carrick laid a wreath on the pitch alongside Frank.",
      "The players wore black armbands, and Fernandes wore a special captain's armband to pay tribute to the tragedy. Most wouldn't have seen the Munich clock attached to Fernandes' arm. \"Stand up for the Busby Babes,\" was aired in the first half, and thousands of supporters rose to their feet.",
      "United show their class with their tributes each year to the Munich Air Disaster. Fernandes attended the memorial service on the day before the game, and the armband he wore was a nice touch.",

      "Tyler Fletcher pictured on his Premier League debut for Manchester United(Image: Carl Recine/Getty Images)",
      "Manchester United youngster Tyler Fletcher explained he was told to make as many passes as he could before making his debut in the 2-0 victory over Tottenham Hotspur on Saturday. Fletcher, who is the son of Darren and the twin brother of Jack, has been in and around the first team this season.",
      "While his brother has made three appearances for the Reds this season, Fletcher has had to remain patient to get his own chance in the Premier League. With the game entering its final moments on Saturday, interim head coach Michael Carrick gave the youngster the opportunity for his first senior minutes as he replaced Kobbie Mainoo.",
      "Reflecting on the experience at full time, Fletcher told MUTV: \"It's a mad day. I'm absolutely buzzing. The best day of my life, it's a dream come true. I've just got to thank everyone for supporting me, throughout the way.",

      "Try MEN Premium NOW for just £1",
      "\"It's an honour to have one of those [academy] numbers. Not many people do it. I'm grateful it's happened. To get to go on the pitch and play at Old Trafford, it's a special feeling.\"",
      "The debut came at the end of what was an exciting couple of days for the youngster as he discovered he would be part of the matchday squad. \"I found out I was in the squad yesterday, after the session. I got told you will be with the first team, you'll be on the bench. I was buzzing with that,\" he explained.",
      "\"I was warming up in the last five minutes and five minutes got added on. I got the call and I was like: 'No way is this happening'.",
      "\"I was told to go and enjoy it and make as many passes as you can, get as many touches as you can, and that's what I did.\" Fletcher's big day rounded off a successful afternoon for United as they picked up their fourth victory in as many matches.",
      "Just before the half hour mark, Spurs were reduced to ten men as Cristian Romero was sent off for a poor challenge on Casemiro. Less than ten minutes later, United made their man advantage count as a well-worked set-piece routine resulted in Bryan Mbeumo sweeping the ball home.",
      "In the 81st minute, captain Bruno Fernandes sealed the three points with a smart finish in front of the Stretford End.",

      "Diogo Dalot: Decent effort on goal in the second half and bright in the first. Not always convincingly defensively in the second half but good cross for the second goal. 7",

      "Manchester United beat Tottenham for the first time in eight attempts as they won 2-0 at Old Trafford",
      "Michael Carrick immediately felt the step up in standards when he moved from Tottenham to Manchester United in 2006. On his first day through the door at Old Trafford, he knew he was at a different beast when it came to football clubs.",
      "So it was no surprise that Carrick the coach was the man to end United's dismal recent run against Spurs. The iconic Sir Alex Ferguson phrase \"lads, it's Tottenham\" hasn't really been working recently. They had failed to beat Spurs in any of their last eight games.",
      "That reached a nadir in May in what was a rotten Europa League final in Bilbao. United didn't turn up, and Tottenham won a wretched game, but in some ways, maybe that is now helping Carrick. He is putting the free midweeks to better use than Ruben Amorim ever was, anyway.",
      "There was again evidence of United getting things right between games, though this match changed when Cristian Romero was shown a red card for catching Casemiro on the ankle after half an hour. It summed up the way things are going for Carrick at the moment that any worries about having to break down 10 men were quickly put to bed with an excellent set-piece routine.",
      "Things threatened to get nervous before Bruno Fernandes killed the game off nine minutes from the end, securing Carrick a fourth successive win in charge. Not all of this performance was convincing, but if he keeps winning, then the job will be his. Champions League football certainly feels like it is getting closer.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FACEBOOK PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "That was the prize on offer in that Europa League final. United have suffered financially without it, but there is an argument they are now better placed as a result of that defeat. Had Amorim enjoyed the sort of European campaign that Thomas Frank has, then he would surely still be in charge at Old Trafford.",
      "Instead, the Stretford End is belting out 'it's Carrick, you know' and positivity is flowing around Old Trafford again. Kobbie Mainoo couldn't get a look in under Amorim but was once again outstanding here.",
      "Most importantly, United have shown the benefits of time on the training ground under a coaching staff with a plan that suits them. Carrick is hands-on at Carrington, and Steve Holland's experience has been invaluable. Some of the football they produced against Tottenham had the hallmarks of training time all over it.",
      "The front three of Amad, Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo played off the cuff but with an understanding of what they were trying to do and where they would be. They were close in distance, and that allowed for the kind of interchanges that can trouble any defence.",
      "Amad and Cunha nearly prised open the Spurs defence with one slick first-half exchange, before Mainoo and Amad linked up to scythe through the midfield and open up space.",
      "United had looked enterprising, but the challenge changed when Romero was sent off. Although the advantage was now United's, Old Trafford held its breath as Casemiro rolled around in agony. The success of this season might just hinge on his fitness, so the sigh of relief when he picked himself up was audible.",
      "The sending-off meant United now had to break down a low block. The best way to do that is often from set-pieces and it took just nine minutes to do so. Jonny Evans has been in charge of set-pieces on Carrick's coaching team and he deserves credit for this routine, as do the analysts who spotted the space to exploit.",
      "Mainoo's run across the goalmouth created space, and from Fernandes' low pass, he turned it back to the edge of the box, where Mbeumo was unmarked with room to run on the ball.",
      "His low, left-footed finish was perfectly placed and was a particularly painful blow for his former Brentford boss Frank, who tried to hijack Mbeumo's move to Old Trafford in the summer. The forward only had eyes for Old Trafford and although Spurs' interest pushed the price up, he has looked to be worth every penny of the £65million it cost United to sign him.",
      "He is certainly making an impact in the big games as well. He has scored home and away against Tottenham this season, as well as finding the back of the net against Liverpool, Manchester City and Arsenal.",
      "His goal gave United the cushion they needed, but driving home the advantage proved difficult. Luke Shaw and Diogo Dalot had shots from distance saved by Guglielmo Vicario around the hour mark, and Harry Maguire could feel aggrieved he didn't get a penalty when Micky van de Ven channelled the Six Nations spirit to rugby tackle his fellow centre-back.",
      "Things were threatening to become nervous and anxiety was seeping in, but Fernandes relieved the pressure valve. Sub Benjamin Sesko couldn't connect with Dalot's cross but Fernandes produced an instinctive finish to steer the ball back across goal and inside the post to put the game to bed.",

      "Ruben Amorim's reputation took a massive hit at Manchester United (Image: Carl Recine/Getty Images)",
      "Ian Wright has suggested that Kobbie Mainoo's revival under Michael Carrick at Manchester United should be a source of embarrassment for Ruben Amorim. Mainoo, who was largely overlooked during Amorim's tenure, has become a pivotal figure in United's recent upturn in form under interim head coach Carrick.",
      "United's 2-0 victory over Tottenham Hotspur on Saturday marked their fourth consecutive win since Carrick took over last month. Mainoo has played the full 90 minutes in almost all of Carrick's matches at the helm, helping them defeat Manchester City, Arsenal, Fulham and Spurs to secure fourth place in the Premier League.",
      "The 20-year-old United academy graduate had been considering a move in the January transfer window during Amorim's reign, with Napoli showing interest. However, Amorim's dismissal on January 5 changed everything for him, with two assists and several key contributions coming in the past month.",
      "And former Arsenal and England forward Wright, a long-time admirer of Mainoo, believes that while his recent performances enhance Carrick's standing, they should also reflect poorly on Amorim.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FB PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "Speaking on the Premier League World Show following the victory over Spurs, he said: \"Everybody was confused with what was happening under Ruben Amorim.",
      "\"When you look at (Mainoo), someone who's not played, coming into a Man United side that's not in great form. To play in that midfield which is where all the questions have been around... just the quality.",
      "\"You're listening to Bruno [Fernandes] saying they've been given the freedom to express themselves because they're good players. And Kobbie is a very, very good player. I'm just pleased we're seeing that now.",
      "Ian Wright has slammed Ruben Amorim (Image: Stick to Football)",
      "\"I think it's very embarrassing for Ruben Amorim if we're going to be totally honest. Because what we seen was a Man United youth product not given the opportunity to play and very, very close to leaving the club.\"",
      "Mainoo had considered joining Napoli - and his former United teammate Scott McTominay - in January, due to his frustration with being a substitute under Amorim. The ex-manager's preference for the 3-4-3 formation left him on the bench, with Casemiro and Fernandes in central midfield, but Carrick has made him a regular alongside the Brazilian in a 4-2-3-1 formation.",
      "\"There's no doubt about Kobbie's ability and what he can bring,\" Carrick said after goals from Bryan Mbeumo and Fernandes secured victory against 10-man Spurs. \"He's still so young and learning the game. He has had the big high and then not playing for a bit. It is easier to think he is older than he is.\"",
      "Mainoo's ultimate aim is to secure a spot in Thomas Tuchel's squad for the World Cup in the United States, Canada and Mexico this summer.",
      "He has not represented England since 2024 and faces a challenging task to displace one of Tuchel's preferred central midfielders before the tournament kicks off on June 11.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Kobbie Mainoo had another superb game for United against Tottenham",
      "Michael Carrick believes Kobbie Mainoo has plenty of room to improve despite praising another outstanding midfield performance from the 20-year-old against Tottenham.",
      "Mainoo didn't start any of the first 20 games of the Premier League season but has been back in favour since Ruben Amorim was sacked and he has started all four games under Carrick, with United winning all of them.",
      "The academy graduate is getting better by the week and ran the show against Spurs, with Carrick delighted with the midfielder's performance. Mainoo has also struck up an excellent partnership with Casemiro and the United head coach also believes the youngster is learning a lot from the five-times Champions League winner.",
      "Try MEN Premium NOW for just £1",
      "\"There's definitely more to come from him, and that's just the stage he's at in his career, he's just starting out, essentially,\" said Carrick. \"He's got so much experience under his belt, of big occasions, big games, and pressurised situations.",
      "\"That's going to help him develop, learn the game and playing next to Case, and learning off him, things that he's probably not even realising he's picking up, just playing next to him as well as the other players around him. I think that's just part of his journey to learn and develop.",
      "\"As I said, I'm really conscious that he's come in, he's played the four games, and he's found his rhythm. Young players will have times when they're up, and then they might have a little dip, that's not all of a sudden, he's good, or he's a poor player. Kobbie is what he is.",
      "\"Managing that's really important for, especially for younger players, and understanding that. So he's done fantastic at the moment. He's having a really big impact on games and we'll keep working with him and helping him, try and keep improving him as well as we go.\"",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FACEBOOK PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "Mainoo's form is all the more impressive given he had such a bit-part role at United while Amorim in charge. He has quickly rediscovered his best form and Carrick has been pleased with his response.",
      "\"Yeah, there's no doubt, Kobbie's ability, of what he can bring,\" he said. \"I think he's still so young and just be careful about putting all this so much right on his shoulders and expecting so much of him.",
      "\"I think he's still learning the game, he's had a big high, and then, obviously, he didn't play for a little bit. It's easy to think he's a lot older and more experienced probably than he is, but credit to him, he's come right in and found his rhythm of football, which is not easy after a period of time out.",
      "\"We know he can handle the ball, and hopefully over time, which I'm sure he'll keep improving, you know, and he's got to be patient and not expect too much from him all the time.\"",

      "Michael Carrick made it four wins from four in charge of Manchester United as his dream start continued with a 2-0 win over 10-man Tottenham.",
      "United profited from Cristian Romero's first half sending off with Bryan Mbuemo slotting the Reds in front from a well worked corner routine shortly after the visitors were reduced to 10 men.",
      "United were comfortable but needed a second to settle late nerves and Bruno Fernandes provided it with a calm finish",
      "The win keeps United in the top four as their resurgence continues. Catch up with all the action, reaction and analysis in our blog below",
      "Michael Carrick immediately felt the step up in standards when he moved from Tottenham to Manchester United in 2006. On his first day through the door at Old Trafford, he knew he was at a different beast when it came to football clubs.",
      "So it was no surprise that Carrick the coach was the man to end United's dismal recent run against Spurs. The iconic Sir Alex Ferguson phrase \"lads, it's Tottenham\" hasn't really been working recently. They had failed to beat Spurs in any of their last eight games.",
      "That reached a nadir in May in what was a rotten Europa League final in Bilbao. United didn't turn up, and Tottenham won a wretched game, but in some ways, maybe that is now helping Carrick. He is putting the free midweeks to better use than Ruben Amorim ever was, anyway.",
      "Read Tyrone Marshall's on the whistle analysis here",
      "Senne Lammens: One nervy moment with his feet in the first half but was barely troubled after that as Tottenham struggled to create with 10 men. 6",
      "Diogo Dalot: Decent effort on goal in the second half and bright in the first. Not always convincingly defensively in the second half but good cross for the second goal. 7",
      "Harry Maguire: Unsettled by Simons at one point early on, and didn't show the calmness that has been evident in his game in recent weeks. 6",
      "Lisandro Martinez: Got forward more than we've seen at times and passed it well, but one woeful touch in the second half was nearly costly. 6",
      "Luke Shaw: Stung the palms of Vicario with a second-half effort. Relatively untroubled defensively on what was his 25th successive start in the Premier League. 7",
      "Casemiro: Wasn't having his best game before being on the wrong end of Romero's tackle, but improved after that and was a goal threat again. 7",
      "Kobbie Mainoo: Lovely lay-off to Mbeumo for the opening goal and excelled in midfield again. Some clever link-up play with those in front of him and found space intelligently. 8",

      "Five minutes added.",
      "Mazraoui, Ugarte and Zirkzee ON.",
      "Shaw, Casemiro and Mbeumo OFF.",
      "Fernandes knee slides in front of the Stretford End. Casemiro tried to get Lammens to celebrate with the team, but he returned to his goal. Another big win for Carrick, a fourth on the bounce in the topflight.",
      "Sesko replaces Cunha for the closing exchanges.",
      "Martinez's touch was awful and Dalot completely missed a header from a corner. United cannot afford to lose concentration when the game is 1-0. Meanwhile, Carrick is preparing Sesko to be introduced to the game.",
      "United need to kill this game off with another goal because Tottenham have a chance to salvage a result if the scoreline stays the same.",
      "That was brilliant from Fernandes, who demonstrated his footwork before playing a clever ball into the box. The Stretford End reacted by singing his name. The United captain has made the team tick again today.",
      "Tottenham punted a ball in the box and Lammens claimed it with confidence.",
      "There's been a lengthy break as the injured Udogie is replaced by Souza.",
      "Dalot did brilliantly to get back and recover against Sarr, and he's been quietly really good since relocating to his best position. He didn't look comfortable playing as a left wing-back.",

      "Five minutes added here.",
      "United came close to scoring from another corner - they are dangerous from set-pieces.",
      "The turnaround with Carrick has been nothing short of remarkable. The red card changed the game completely, but United are now in a stellar position to secure a fourth win on the bounce in the Premier League.",
      "What a clever finish from Mbeumo, who finds the bottom right corner.",
      "Beautiful corner routine from Fernandes and Mainoo.",
      "That is Romero all over. A heavy touch and then a recklessly heavy tackle that could have seriously injured another player. Six red cards in his Tottenham career and although the fans love him, he is also a liability. Thankfully for United Casemiro looks fine, that could have been a lot worse for him.",
      "Casemiro is back on his feet and looks alright to continue after that tackle.",
      "Romero has been shown a straight red card for a challenge on Casemiro.",
      "Shrug of the shoulders from Amad as a United attack fizzles out. Lammens boots a free-kick downfield but that’s meat and drink for this Tottenham defence against this United attack. Going to have to cuter than that to open them up. Tottenham the better side in the first 20 minutes or so.",
      "Cunha tried his luck with a shot form long range and it flashed inches wide of the post.",
      "Carrick watched on nervously from the touchline when Tottenham fired a ball across the box, but the danger was thwarted. Frank will be pleased with his side's start to the match. Simons has caught the eye and is finally performing in a big game. He made a poor start to life at Spurs, but is slowly getting going.",
      "Tottenham just worked the ball forward well to create a decent chance for Gallagher.",
      "Billiant pressing from Fernandes, who sprinted from the front and forced Tottenham into losing the ball.",
      "Cunha looks sharp. He just pleased the crowd with a cheeky backheel and was involved in a slick move around the box. He placed his hands on his head when it came to nothing.",
      "Same team for United but one noticeable tactical shift. Cunha is playing through the middle today, with Mbeumo out on the left. Cunha dropping deep but doing so from more of a central position."

      "The sending off occurred following a poorly executed tackle by the defender on Casemiro early in the match, with the referee promptly showing him the red card.",
      "This proved to be a pivotal moment in the match for both Spurs and United, as goals from Bryan Mbeumo and Bruno Fernandes led to another victory for Michael Carrick - his fourth in as many games as interim boss.",

      "Casemiro was fortunate to avoid picking up a serious injury after the collision, but continued on to help United on towards another important victory.",

      "\"The first goal ends up coming from a really well-worked corner. There’s different ways to get that goal, but the boys pulled it off really well.",
      "\"Credit to Jonny Evans and Kaita [Hasegawa] who kind of put that together and worked with the boys over the few days of having that day. So there’s different ways you can break teams down but fortunately for us today, we managed to pull it off.\"",

      "United are interested in RB Leipzig winger Yan Diomande",
      "Manchester United are interested in RB Leipzig winger Yan Diomande as they consider attacking reinforcements this summer, but they will face serious competition for the Ivory Coast star. United missed out on a January move for Antoine Semenyo, with the forward joining Manchester City for £62.5million, and opted not to pursue any other targets during the window.",
      "While central midfield is a major priority heading into the summer, United will also try to sign a left-winger and Diomande is a player they have monitored and someone who is of interest.",
      "The 19-year-old has had a breakthrough season for RB Leipzig, registering eight goals and six assists in 21 games in Germany. Diomande only turned 19 in November but is already attracting the attention of some of Europe's biggest clubs. The right-footed attacker can play on both wings but would be seen as an option on the left at Old Trafford.",
      "Try MEN Premium NOW for just £1",
      "United have monitored Diomande's emergence this season and after staying at RB Leipzig in the January window, there is now an expectation that he will leave the club in the summer.",
      "He was in the Ivory Coast squad for the Africa Cup of Nations alongside Amad and played in all five of his country's games in Morocco. He has three goals in his nine caps so far.",
      "Liverpool have also been linked with a move for Diomande and Paris Saint-Germain are expected to challenge for his signature in the summer. Reports in Germany have suggested Leipzig have slapped a €100million price tag on the player, but the teenager is likely to leave the club for a fee lower than that.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FACEBOOK PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "United intended to use Semenyo as a left-wing option had they signed the 26-year-old. Patrick Dorgu has since impressed in that position for Michael Carrick and Matheus Cunha played there against Fulham, but both are versatile players who could be needed elsewhere.",
      "Dorgu can also play on the right wing, and with Tyrell Malacia leaving the club this summer, he might be needed as cover at left-back. Cunha can play as a false nine and has done so off the bench in Carrick's first two games, while he can also fulfil the No.10 role.",
      "United are set to see two left-wingers depart this summer. Jadon Sancho is out of contract and will leave the club, while Marcus Rashford will aim to complete a permanent transfer to Barcelona.",

      "RB Leipzig star Yan Diomande is on Manchester United's radar(Image: Ulrik Pedersen/NurPhoto via Getty Images)",
      "Manchester United spent the January transfer window keeping their powder dry as they stuck to their long-term approach to signings. Ruben Amorim's departure at the beginning of the month ensured this was an easier sell than it might have otherwise been, with few expecting an interim head coach to let loose in the transfer market.",
      "It was also a decision that became more palatable with the fans as Michael Carrick started to get a tune out of the players at his disposal. Three straight victories over Manchester City, Arsenal and Fulham have reduced calls for reinforcements, as have the returns of Bryan Mbeumo, Amad and Noussair Mazraoui from AFCON.",
      "However, the Reds did flirt with the possibility of making one major reinforcement. Antoine Semenyo was the man in demand during the opening stages of the window and United were willing to spend £65m to bring him to Old Trafford.",
      "Try MEN Premium NOW for just £1",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FACEBOOK PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "In the end, the Ghana international chose to move to Manchester City. That decision meant the transfer funds were locked away for another few months. But while United chose not to move for an alternative forward in January after missing out on Semenyo, this does not mean the Reds have abandoned the hunt entirely.",
      "It is understood RB Leipzig left winger Yan Diomande is on the Reds' radar ahead of the summer transfer window, with Liverpool and Paris Saint-Germain also monitoring the youngster. Diomande only moved to the Bundesliga club last summer but major European teams are already starting to sniff around the forward.",
      "The 19-year-old has bagged eight goals and six assists for Leipzig this season and having broken into the Ivory Coast's national team in October, he has already scored three goals for his country, including one against Burkina Faso at AFCON.",
      "It was while Diomande was at the tournament in Morocco that he earned the seal of approval from Amad. Having enjoyed a rapid rise, United's winger has forged a good friendship with the teenager which could become useful at the end of the season.",
      "When asked about Diomande, Amad said: \"We’re very close off the pitch, so that makes things easier on the pitch. If I have the opportunity to pass to him, I pass to him; if he has the opportunity to pass to me, he passes to me.",
      "\"Yan is a very good player, everyone knows that.\" While it may seem trivial to some, having a player in your camp with an existing friendship with a transfer target might well help your cause.",
      "You only have to look back to the summer and Andre Onana's role in bringing Mbeumo to Old Trafford. The goalkeeper worked to convince the former Brentford man United was the right place for his next career move.",
      "Should United pick up the phone for Diomande in the summer and the forward wishes to seek advice, he may well speak to Amad. Carrick might not be the man in the hot seat by then, but the job he is doing so far should make any sell a little easier by the summer.",
      "Champions League football might be a must for Diomande in the 2026/27 season and there is no guarantee either United or Leipzig will be able to offer it to him. But if Carrick does manage to turn this good start into qualification for the competition, the Ivorian may be even more inclined to sign for the Reds should they make an approach.",

      "United agreed to Casemiro’s request to confirm his summer departure, and a video with the Brazilian explaining his decision was released on club channels. United sources said the decision not to renew Casemiro's contract had been made well in advance of the announcement.",
      "Michael Carrick recently said his opinion would be canvassed on potential replacements for Casemiro, and the conversation about who should succeed the 33-year-old is ongoing among supporters.",

      "Carlos Baleba, Elliot Anderson and Adam Wharton are admired at Old Trafford. None of those options would be available cheaply, and there are question marks about whether they are ready to sign for United. Our writers have debated who United should sign to replace Casemiro...",
      "Tyrone Marshall",
      "The challenge for whoever comes in to replace Casemiro will be dealing with the pressure of doing just that. A five-time Champions League winner, 82 caps (and counting) for Brazil and nine years at Real Madrid, he was comfortable in the Old Trafford pressure cooker from day one.",
      "I like Elliot Anderson as the most stylistically similar fit to Casemiro. He is proving his worth as a holding midfielder for England, but also has a brilliant passing range. Casemiro could do both of those jobs, shielding his back four but also progressing the ball and helping to penetrate a low block.",
      "Anderson has nowhere near the experience of Casemiro, but he is the type of character who doesn't seem to get fazed. The way he has settled into the England squad and won over Thomas Tuchel is a positive sign.",
      "Adam Wharton is a fascinating player, but also a bit of a maverick in that position. I would be fascinated to see him at an elite-level club. But I think Anderson is more likely to be successful and brings a better all-round package at the moment.",
      "Elliot Anderson of Nottingham Forest(Image: Andrew Kearns - CameraSport via Getty Images)",
      "Steven Railston",
      "If United are prepared to splash close to £100m on the likes of Anderson, Baleba and Wharton, they should test the waters by enquiring about Real Madrid midfielder Eduardo Camavinga.",
      "The worst Madrid can do is say no. I would prefer Anderson to Baleba and Wharton, but I've got my doubts about whether the Nottingham Forest talent is cut out for such a big move at this stage of his career.",
      "The expectation to perform to a high level each week at United is completely different to playing for Nottingham Forest. Anderson has excelled for England, but in games against the likes of Wales and Latvia.",
      "Camavinga may be an ambitious target, though. There were murmurs of interest in Morten Hjulmand last summer, and perhaps he could be an option. The 26-year-old is a Denmark international and scored an equaliser against England at Euro 2024, finishing brilliantly from 30 yards to secure a point for his country in the group stage.",

      "And United should pick Anderson ahead of Wharton. The Nottingham Forest midfielder is more versatile than Wharton, and has now established himself at the highest level with England.",
      "He will go to the World Cup this summer, where it is hoped he will improve his game even more. He doesn't look like someone who would be fazed by the pressure and expectation that comes with playing for United.",

      "Benjamin Sesko delivered for Michael Carrick last week and now he needs to start a game",
      "The injury Patrick Dorgu picked up against Arsenal made Michael Carrick's decision a simple one last week, but had the in-form winger remained fit, it would have been interesting to see how the Manchester United head coach would have dealt with a predicament that is threatening to become a regular occurrence.",
      "After two goals in two games against Manchester City and Arsenal, Dorgu looked to have nailed down the spot on the left wing in Carrick's 4-2-3-1 system. The headache was Matheus Cunha, who came off the bench in both matches to register an assist and a goal.",
      "Carrick was interesting when speaking about the Brazilian at the Emirates Stadium after he scored the late winner, explaining how disappointed he had been not to start either game, but that he had channelled that frustration in the right way to make an impact off the bench.",
      "Try MEN Premium NOW for just £1",
      "It was excellent man-management from the 44-year-old, but Carrick has been around the block often enough to know that it also has a shelf life. After that kind of impact as a substitute, Cunha needs the reward of a start.",
      "The problem with that is the lack of games available to United this season. In the flow of a relatively standard United season, there would have been a European game for Cunha to start between those fixtures. There would be another FA Cup tie on the horizon.",
      "Instead, there are only league fixtures, and only a couple of those are midweek rounds between now and the end of the season. After his heroics as a substitute, Cunha hadn't started for three weeks. Carrick had got a tune out of the £62.5million summer signing, but had he been benched once again for the Fulham fixture, that might have changed.",
      "It is all well and good to challenge players to make an impact off the bench, but there has to be a reward when they rise to that challenge; otherwise, it becomes hollow. There will be a feeling that no matter what you do with your limited time on the pitch, it won't be enough to earn you a start.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FACEBOOK PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "That's why Cunha had to start against Fulham, no matter what. The injury to Dorgu, while extremely unfortunate for a player in the best form of his United career, simply opened an easy route back into the team.",
      "Keeping a squad happy will be a challenge for Carrick over the next 14 games. It might even be the biggest challenge he faces when there are just four games in February and four games in March. Rotation isn't looking likely at the moment, with a settled team delivering results.",
      "The next situation for the former United midfielder to assess is that of Benjamin Sesko, who shone in two games under Darren Fletcher but has been a substitute in all three under Carrick. The £73million striker has been on the pitch for just 25 minutes across those matches.",
      "But he delivered what Carrick believes to be a \"huge moment\" on Sunday, scoring that 94th-minute winner against Fulham. It has undoubtedly given the 22-year-old a major lift and he has four goals in his last four appearances for United.",
      "Can Carrick keep that confidence and momentum going with cameos off the bench here and there? Or does he need to reward another young player who has done what was asked of him and influenced a game from the bench?",
      "You feel it should be the latter and that's why Sesko is surely deserving of a start against Tottenham on Saturday or West Ham on Tuesday.",

      "The same observation was made when Lammens reported for international duty with Belgium last week - the 23-year-old was dressed in a beige collared jacket, a khaki t-shirt and chinos.",
      "\"By accident, I saw an article saying he was wearing something boring when he reported for international duty and fans saying they hoped he stays like this,\" laughed Hayk Milkon, one of Lammens' former coaches.",
      "\"This 'boringness' is just the way Senne is, he's really calm and no excesses. He focuses on what he needs to focus on and is open with the people around him. He keeps his feet on the ground.\"",
      "If Lammens looks like someone who could work in an office, every workplace would love to have him in their five-a-side team. United believe they have signed a young goalkeeper with huge potential, and fans who were present at Old Trafford against Sunderland left the stadium buzzing about his debut.",
      "The quirk is that Lammens appears to be a different person when he wears his goalkeeper kit. He made a supremely confident United debut, aggressively commanded his area and kept a clean sheet.",
      "Milkon coached Lammens during their time together at Club Brugge. Milkon is now the youngest manager in the Belgian top-flight and Lammens plays for the biggest club in England.",
      "\"It was Senne with his headphones on. He would go into the gym to do his recovery or some extra top-ups. Or he would just go to relax by playing basketball - he loved to play basketball.\"",
      "Lammens celebrates against Sunderland. (Image: 2025 Ben Roberts - Danehouse)",
      "Milkon coached in different roles at Club Brugge. He was the assistant of Club NXT (their reserve team), served as their interim manager, was in charge of the Under-18s and eventually became a first-team coach.",
      "His time at Club Brugge coincided with Lammens progressing from the academy to their first team, so he is uniquely positioned to provide insight into United's new goalkeeper signing.",
      "Lammens joined Club Brugge's academy when he was 12. \"He was a guy with huge potential,\" said Milkon. \"As I learned from colleagues who had worked with him when he was much younger, I heard there was a moment that clicked in his head when he became super professional.",
      "\"He was one of the guys during Covid - when the players were not able to train - who was doing a lot at home, he was really going far with this to be the best in these types of areas.",
      "\"Then he continued like this when he joined the first team to train with them. He always wanted to improve. We also had something in place to look at the parameters on which goalkeepers are judged.",
      "\"You see the potential of the goalkeeper based on what they do in games; so their positioning, their decision-making and so on, and Senne was always quite high in these areas.",
      "\"The only bad luck that he had was that the first-team goalkeeper was Simon Mignolet. He's an amazing goalkeeper, so it was difficult for Senne to stay over there in the role of No.2.",
      "\"That would have also blocked his growth, so it was good for him in the end to make the step to go to Antwerp and he did a tremendous job there. It was amazing to see how fast he adapted.\"",
      "Milkon pictured during his stint with Club Brugge (he now manages F.C.V. Dender).",
      "Milkon continued: \"I think for us at Club Brugge, it was very clear to everyone that Senne was a top goalkeeper. He would have been the perfect fit for Club Brugge to be the No.1.",
      "\"That was not possible because Mignolet was there. But the parameters that we used to judge his performances indicated he was ticking so many boxes already, and he was consistently doing it.",
      "\"There weren't ups and downs with his performances. He was consistently really high and when you compare this to the top goalkeepers, you have a benchmark to say 'Ok, what potential does this guy have?'",
      "\"He had some chances with the first team at Club Brugge and made a mistake, or maybe two, but in the end it was very clear to everyone that he was a top goalkeeper.",
      "\"It was impossible to try to extend his contract because, again, you have Mignolet, and you cannot block a guy like this. You know he has to go out, he has to play, and he will improve even more.\"",
      "When asked about Lammens' strengths, he said: \"I would say that his decision-making was very good. He is very calm, he sees the solutions on the pitch, he has a quick reaction time and understands the balance between risk and reward, and which decisions are the right ones to make.",
      "\"His clean passing is great, his footwork was really good, and he's just an amazing goalkeeper with the shot-stopping. He made some incredible saves back then already. He's quite a complete goalkeeper.",
      "\"But making the right decisions at a very young age, being very mature with this, was really impressive. And the fact that he is good with both feet is another big strength.",
      "\"For me, Senne is a very calm guy and has all the qualities to be a top professional. That was my impression when I first met him when he was younger and he never changed.\"",
      "A baby-faced Lammens playing for Club Brugge in 2021. (Image: 2021 BSR Agency)",

      "His performances drew attention from the Belgian media. Lammens saved four penalties across a successful first full campaign and received a call-up to Belgium's senior squad in March.",
      "Milkon said: \"I was not surprised when I saw Manchester United had come calling. And to record his first clean sheet, I was really happy for him. Senne is a potential No.1 for the Red Devils - the Belgium national team.",
      "\"He got his chance, he took it, and we're all really proud of him, but we knew it would happen. I believe he has all the capabilities to become the best in the world, so I wish him all the best. I'm sure he will have a very good career in England, and Manchester United should return to the big club they used to be.",
      "\"He will have a positive impact on that, for sure, and hopefully he will be Belgium's first-choice goalkeeper soon. I believe he has the potential, the skillset and the personality to do that.",
      "\"For me, it was just having a tiny little part in having an influence on him at Brugge, but it was the most positive memories of our relationship that we had during this spell.",
      "\"I'm very proud that he is reaching these high levels and not surprised. I believe he will be successful because he is a guy who will not change his focus or start to do something different. He is calm, that's his personality and character, and he wants to succeed. He is hungry and will keep working to be his best.",
      "\"He is so calm, and you have to be patient in football. You cannot worry too much and want things too early, but finding the balance between not being impatient and, at the same time, pushing and demanding what you deserve in a good way, means everything will sort itself out.\"",
      "Lammens in action for Royal Antwerp in 2024. (Image: Photonews 2024)",
      "United staff who have worked with Lammens at Carrington have echoed Milkon's sentiments. He has been described as \"really mature for his age\" and is said to have taken the move in his stride.",
      "Lammens is understood to have impressed coaches during training sessions and a United source said that lots of people have been speaking positively about him. He has already relocated from the luxury hotel where he was initially staying and into a house.",
      "It's no surprise that Lammens likes to play basketball at 6ft 3in, but he is a keen golfer, which is common ground with the likes of Tom Heaton, Luke Shaw, Mason Mount and Harry Maguire.",
      "Matthijs de Ligt, Amad, Maguire and Shaw jogged straight to Lammens to congratulate him after full-time against Sunderland. \"Are you Schmeichel in disguise?\" was chanted at Lammens from the Stretford End.",
      "It remains to be seen whether Lammens will start against Liverpool on Sunday, but it would be a surprise to see him on the bench after delivering a strong debut before the international break.",

      "Premier League clubs are monitoring developments in Italy, with Christian Pulisic emerging as a possible summer opportunity.",
      "According to a report from Calciomercato, AC Milan are preparing to reshape their squad at the end of the season, and Pulisic is among the players whose future is now under discussion as part of that process.",
      "The winger has re-established himself since leaving England and remains a regular for Milan, but reports from Italy suggest the club would consider a sale in the region of €55m if the right offer arrives.",
      "That valuation has not gone unnoticed among Premier League clubs, where Pulisic’s situation is being tracked as clubs weigh up attacking options ahead of the next window.",
      "Pulisic has scored 10 goals this season and featured prominently in Milan’s Champions League campaign, with his form in Serie A restoring his standing after a mixed spell earlier in his career.",
      "His potential availability is less a reflection of output and more tied to Milan’s wider planning. Milan are understood to be open to moving on valuable assets if it allows them to refresh the squad and rebalance their structure.",
      "Interest is building from England, with Arsenal, Tottenham, and Manchester United all monitoring the situation as Milan weigh their options.",
      "Arsenal would need to decide whether he fits as a rotation option or a genuine challenger in wide areas.",
      "Tottenham are evidently the shortest on quality in attacking areas, while Man United’s interest may be complicated by recent recruitment in attacking roles.",
      "United spent big on Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo last summer, with a view to raising the level of the starting XI. Any new arrival this coming summer would face stiff competition.",
      "On the other hand, a recent shift to a 4-2-3-1 under Michael Carrick could facilitate Pulisic playing on the right of an attacking three featuring Cunha and Mbeumo.",
      "Arsenal look well subscribed in wide areas, with Eberechi Eze, Gabriel Martinelli, Leandro Trossard, and Noni Madueke all capable of featuring on the wings.",
      "Their North London neighbours, Tottenham, however, look light. Destiny Udogie and Archie Gray operated as wing-backs in a 2-0 defeat to Man Utd at the weekend.",
      "If Thomas Frank survives the season and Spurs remain in the Premier League, they’ll surely want to add to an attacking core that doesn’t feature an out-and-out wide player.",

      "Italian media have found a new folk hero in Scott McTominay, with the former Manchester United midfielder earning a level of reverence rarely afforded to imports in Serie A.",
      "The reaction followed Napoli’s chaotic 3-2 win over Genoa, a game that once again placed McTominay at the centre of everything, even though his involvement lasted just 45 minutes.",
      "McTominay scored a superb long-range goal, helped spark Napoli’s equaliser and then spent the second half watching from the sidelines after being withdrawn with an injury that has troubled him for weeks.",
      "Despite his goal contributions, McTominay’s influence is largely measured in character, resilience and presence.",
      "His continued influence has reportedly earned him sit-down talks with Napoli to discuss extending his contract to 2030, though he was recently linked with a return to Old Trafford.",
      "McTominay joined Man Utd’s academy at the age of five, rose through the ranks and spent seven years in the first-team squad, often filling gaps rather than being built around.",
      "Across 178 Premier League appearances for United, he scored 19 league goals and was regularly used in multiple roles, including spells further forward when the squad lacked options.",
      "The shift has been stark since his £25.7m move to Napoli in August 2024. Under Antonio Conte, McTominay has become a core figure, contributing goals, physical authority and leadership.",
      "But he’s also being managed carefully by the former Chelsea and Tottenham boss.",
      "McTominay’s weekend goal against Genoa proved decisive, yet Conte opted to remove him at half-time.",
      "Il Napolista praised McTominay’s contribution to Napoli’s opener and described his performance as “a magnificent moral brace”, before signing off its assessment with the line: “God save Scott McTominay.”",
      "Corriere dello Sport struck a similar tone, awarding him an eight out of ten and summing up his appeal simply: “When the going gets tough, he’s always the toughest.”",
      "His goal was labelled “beautiful”, while his display was described as “exceptional”, adding that he continued to “shoot, run and fight like hell”, earning him the tag “the Rocky of football”.",
      "After the game, Conte explained the decision in full. “Scott has been dealing with this problem since the beginning of the year,” he said.",
      "“It’s an inflammation of the tendons in the area between the gluteus maximus and the hamstrings. This discomfort forces him to play at a reduced pace.",
      "“He would have continued, but at the end of the first half I preferred to avoid any stupid risks. We’re talking about a key player for us, I need him to be 100%. We hope to get him back as soon as possible.”",
      "Since arriving in Naples, he has delivered 18 Serie A goals across two seasons, helped Napoli lift the Supercoppa Italiana in December and established himself as one of Conte’s most trusted players.",

      "The Premier League has gone a little bit sack crazy. Managergeddon is upon us and we are entirely here for the drama.",
      "Five clubs have changed manager since September. One has already done so twice, and could make another change.",
      "The pressure has eased on West Ham boss Nuno Espirito Santo – a couple of wins really is all it takes to transform this market currently – and even a grim point at Burnley was enough to save Thomas Frank, among whose latest crimes is wandering around Bournemouth with a little Arsenal coffee cup in his hands and also losing to the aforementioned Nuno in El Sackico. And – this bit feels important – serving up some of the least watchable football on Premier League record. It is surely ‘when’ not ‘if’ territory there, despite an absurd and very Spurs draw against Man City.",
      "And it now looks like Arne Slot rather than Frank or Nuno will be the latest ‘winner’ here as Liverpool’s fraudulent unbeaten run finally came to an end at Bournemouth, who like West Ham, have been rejuvenated by Frank and Dr Tottenham.",
      "Frank, of course, only moved to Spurs in the summer to replace Ange Postecoglou who has already been hired and sacked by Nottingham Forest since then, while the true lay of the land at big clubs is laid bare by the fact two of the Big Six have binned off managers not for unacceptable results on the pitch but for unacceptable failure to acknowledge infallible wisdom and brilliance of their boardroom superiors. It is immensely modern football and there is almost zero chance we’ve seen the last of the managergeddon for the season. Not by a long chalk.",
      "Meanwhile, here are possible replacement managers currently between jobs, any one of whom really could, if they’re not careful, accidentally end up manager of Tottenham before the season is out.",
      "Rankings based on the latest best prices available at Oddschecker.com…",
      "",
      "An earlier version of this oft-updated piece speculated on what might happen to Mikel Arteta should Arsenal suffer from their Nightmare Start. What if they lost a few early games? What then? We concluded this:",
      "It’s far likelier that Arsenal emerge blinking into the autumn sunshine broadly unscathed from their nightmare horrors. No denying that this season does represent one in which Arteta might completely lose the plot and go entirely off the rails. Or the one where he wins the league by 10 points. Feels like we’re odds-on to get one or the other.",
      "Arsenal emerged duly unscathed, and cashed in on the shift to easier fixtures of their own alongside much tougher ones for Liverpool to take top spot and control in the Premier League.",
      "Only question that remains, therefore, is what Arsenal do from here. We are still absolutely certain that it either involves p*ssing the league by 10 points or a complete and total meltdown. Nothing in between is acceptable or even conceivable, and even now with 13 games to go both options appear tantalisingly plausible.",
      "READ: Who will be the next manager of Arsenal if Mikel Arteta is sacked?",
      "",
      "Doing so well that even suffering the ultimate embarrassment of defeat at Old Trafford didn’t dampen spirits for the most impressive promoted club in quite some time.",
      "Nine wins in the bag already and more points than any of the promoted-relegated teams managed in the entirety of 2024/25. Widespread expectation that tougher games would bring Sunderland back down with a bump have thus far proved wide of the mark; there won’t be many teams unhappy at taking four points from three games against Chelsea and Arsenal this season. The comeback victory over Bournemouth was evidence, if indeed it was still required, that Sunderland are proper, as was beating beleaguered Palace at home.",
      "Success against Newcastle on derby day has us firmly into ‘manager of the year’ territory for one of the big pre-season Sack Race favourites.",
      "",
      "Extraordinary season for Emery already. Began the campaign right at the outside of this market with your Artetas and – unlikely as it now sounds – Slots. Then jumped right up to third favourite when Villa’s rankling disappointment at how last season ended leaked into a six-match winless start to this campaign.",
      "But then along came four Premier League wins in a row to thoroughly lift the mood at a club where a few short weeks earlier it really did feel like they’d come to the end of something special without ever getting the definitive moment of success it deserved.",
      "That run reached 12 wins in 13 Premier League games to lift Villa right through the mid-table slop, then into the top four, and then genuine title contention. And for the first 45 minutes at the Emirates it really did look like they might stick around for much longer.",
      "A sticky run has brought that talk to an end. There’s obviously no shame in not managing to stick around as unlikely title challengers for longer, but some frustration at the manner in which their charge has been halted. Home defeats to Everton and Brentford, given the fortress Villa Park had become, is a bit of a limp end to a game old fight.",
      "But they’re still very much on course for another crack at the Champions League and they’ve also qualified unfussily for the last 16 of a very winnable Europa League. An astonishing shift from what felt like an inexorable downward spiral not that long ago.",
      "We could all learn something from that, but we won’t.",
      "",
      "The continuity candidate in the summer, and looked to have received the ultimate hospital pass. How much continuity could there be at Brentford given they’d sold Bryan Mbeumo, Yoane Wissa and Christian Norgaard, while Thomas Frank took most of the remaining coaching staff with him to Tottenham? It was a very Brentford move to promote from within and we’ll hold our hands up and admit we thought it would go far, far worse than it has.",
      "With Newcastle and Sunderland added to Liverpool and Manchester United on the list of Gtech victims this season and Villa now sorted out home, away and in the Carabao, it’s an undeniably impressive effort in trying circumstances.",
      "That Brentford now sit cosily in Europe-adjacent upper mid-table, 10 points clear of their former manager and his supposedly greener pastures, is quite something.",
      "",
      "Backed in to a hot favourite as the whispers began before the last international break. But just when we thought it might be time to accept something is fundamentally broken here as a relegation fight bubbled up, an impressive win over Sunderland and a restorative visit to Tottenham have sorted things out.",
      "Seven wins and two draws in 14 Premier League games since the November international break have lifted Fulham well away from the relegation battle and into the mid-table strivers, significantly lessening the real risk that either Silva or Fulham might do something they live to regret.",
      "",
      "Sounds preposterous, but there really is a non-zero chance Moyes gets punished for easing Everton’s immediate relegation fears and they seek some more enterprising football from a squad that is, in fairness, capable of that as climbing into the top six demonstrates. Does feel like a very familiar Everton story, though, and one that ends with them 16th, chastened, and bringing in another firefighter.",
      "",
      "Instantly unseated Eddie Howe and Thomas Frank at the top of the list of Premier League managers to sound most like a High Performance Podcast guest with that absurd cack about ageing men.",
      "This is Chelsea, so he absolutely could be gone before the end of the season. But this is managergeddon, and there’s almost no chance at least one other poor sod doesn’t go first. Which is for the best. We’d hate to think of Rosenior being forced out of Chelsea before he’s had any real chance to age any men at all.",
      "",
      "Remained powerfully unsackable even in the depths of one of those long forlorn runs of relegation form that Bournemouth have oft indulged in under Iraola. And now they’re back doing the other thing they do after dramatic 3-2 wins over Spurs and Liverpool and victory at Wolves.",
      "A streaky manager of a streaky team, then, but with relegation a distant memory after the prognostications of doom when he had to sell pretty much his entire defence in the summer he remains firmly in credit and back in contention for all the many ridiculous Big Six jobs that are or will be available during the summer.",
      "",
      "Fine end to 24/25 put a different complexion on Brighton’s season than at one time appeared likely. Ending up a clear best of the rest outside the quickly established top seven represented at least a passing grade and they’d have had to make a truly awful start to the season to get in any kind of managerial-change bother.",
      "The win over Newcastle to go with victory at Chelsea to go with a win over City reaffirmed Brighton’s big-boy-bothering calibre, but does also make some of their other results – draws with Fulham and Spurs (from 2-0 up) and Wolves and West Ham (twice), for instance – a bit annoying.",
      "We still subscribe to the view that every team between about seventh and 14th is equally good/bad and that no major judgement for good or bad should be based on whichever arbitrary position has been handed to them this week.",
      "",
      "The hard-nosed yet valid argument persists that Leeds could and perhaps should have taken drastic action in the summer even after their very good week. It would have made Spurs’ decision to sack Europa League-winning Ange Postecoglou look positively kind, Leeds – and Burnley for that matter – might now be better off had they thanked the managers who secured 100 Championship points and got them back into the big time and then sent them on their way.",
      "Farke had a dreadful Premier League record of only six wins and 26 points from his 49 games in charge of Norwich, a team he twice led to promotion from the Championship with 94 and 97 points.",
      "As well as fighting his own record in this competition, Farke faced the added burden of expectation levels very different to those at just about any other club that could possibly find itself promoted into the Premier League in this current era where that represents the most bittersweet of successes.",
      "Defeat at Burnley was honking, but bouncing back to win another six-pointer against West Ham eased the stress significantly before a paddling at Brighton and events elsewhere – including West Ham themselves – left Farke desperately short of immediate cover before a desperately poor show in a six-pointer at Nottingham Forest.",
      "Another painful defeat having gone in front, against Villa this time, saw Leeds drop into the bottom three ahead of a brutal run of games, but that run has gone surprisingly well. The narrow loss to Man City preceded a rare home win against Chelsea and comeback draw against Liverpool.",
      "The question now is whether Leeds and Farke have really hit on something sustainable, or this is merely delaying the inevitable. After the 4-1 win against Crystal Palace and a very decent point at Sunderland, it really does start to look like it might be the latter which has enormous repercussions for both Farke and several other names around him on this list.",
      "Enormously impressive even in heartbreaking defeat at Newcastle in a wild 4-3 that earned instant classic status. Key now is to ensure that it doesn’t throw them off course, because once the initial pain subsides there is no reason why it should. Victory over Fulham suggests they’ve taken it on the chin; getting slapped silly a second time by Arsenal suggests maybe not.",
      "February is a huge month for Leeds and Farke in the league. Smashing Nottingham Forest in a proper blood-and-thunder six-pointer was huge.",
      "",
      "Might actually have made Wolves… okay? Certainly a lot less bad, anyway. It is still almost certainly too little, too late, but that’s also not really Rob Edwards’ fault either.",
      "The first win of the season was a cathartic dismantling of a doom-laden West Ham, and it didn’t come out of a clear blue sky either. There had been signs of life even in defeat at Arsenal and Liverpool, before running away giggling from Old Trafford with a point.",
      "After a draw at Everton and another at home to Newcastle, that run became six points from four games. That’s a pretty big deal when you only managed two from the previous 18 games.",
      "Stranger things have happened, but admittedly not many. And most of them in the actual Stranger Things. On balance, Wolves would also probably rather believe in a wild conspiracy theory that suggests this current season has actually been entirely fake and that the real ending is yet to be revealed.",
      "",
      "It was quite a 2025 for Nuno. He ended 2024 as our manager of the year; he ended 2025 looking in imminent danger of his second sacking of the season.",
      "Seven points from three games against Newcastle, Burnley and Bournemouth left things looking far comfier than might have been expected for a manager who, when the Magpies took an early lead at the London Stadium, looked to be heading for a second sack of the season long before the Christmas decorations went up.",
      "But quite why Nuno had to be so very Nuno in the way he, on the back of 3-1 and 3-2 wins and a 2-2 draw, decided to approach a home game against a Liverpool team that had just suffered three consecutive three-goal defeats, is puzzling, irritating and, above all, a reminder that he is here as a firefighter and that the marriage to a fanbase with limited patience for drab and functional let’s-not-get-relegated football is merely one of convenience.",
      "However, for neither the first nor last time, Tottenham came to the rescue. The momentum from a job-saving win at Spurs was parlayed into an even more impressive win over Sunderland and, despite the horrific late gut-punch, there was enough about the defeat at Chelsea to suggest the Hammers can at least drag some of the other stupid teams into the equation.",
      "Nuno and West Ham essentially relegated Burnley with a win at Turf Moor and suddenly, it’s not all so negative at the London Stadium.",
      "",
      "A sacking remains out of the question despite continued (relative) struggles. There hasn’t been a Premier League manager since Fergie in his pomp with more credit in the bank than Pep.",
      "But is there still a distinct chance Guardiola decides he’s had enough and simply walks away? We reckon there is as they eye ‘two’ alternatives, and it’s always worth remembering that we’re talking Next Premier League Manager To Leave here, and that the traditional ‘Sack Race’ shorthand is a bit misleading.",
      "Somehow, despite themselves, City have managed to just about remain in the title race. But they are so unconvincing in how they’re going about it. If/when Arsenal do manage to make their superiority properly count in the league table, will Pep decide to sod it all for a game of soldiers? Possibly yes, but almost no chance that happens before at least one other Big Six team pulls the trigger.",
      "",
      "Impossible to avoid the conclusion that Slot’s reaction to Liverpool’s mini-crisis becoming actual-crisis was poor. He went Full Klopp with his salty loser behaviour when Manchester United committed the crime of altering their tactics to give themselves the best chance of success against Liverpool, and the headloss continued after another chaotic and unstructured performance led to a 3-2 defeat at Brentford.",
      "Having ticked ‘opposition doing tactics wrong’ off his rattled manager bingo card, he can now add ‘losing his mind over entirely uncontroversial refereeing decisions’ with his response to both the Cody Gakpo non-penalty and Virgil van Dijk penalty at the Gtech.",
      "It has to be a worry for Liverpool that Slot has for the first time in his Anfield career found himself under any kind of pressure after a chastening run of defeats, and suffered severe and instant headloss as a result.",
      "Funny to think of a manager who’s beaten Real Madrid in the Champions League being under threat, but defeat at the Etihad was miserable before Nottingham Forest came along and achieved the amusing feat of being the first team to shut Liverpool out in the Premier League at Anfield since Nottingham Forest.",
      "And then there was a new nadir against PSV. That really was very, very bad. West Ham were wonderfully welcoming hosts on Sunday, but to such an inexplicable extent that it’s hard to know just how much to read into Liverpool’s 2-0 win at the London Stadium against opponents who were barely there. Predictably, they were poor in a 1-1 against proper team Sunderland and showed no backbone in the collapse at Leeds United, which was then followed by a distinctly unwelcome MO SALAH BOMBSHELL that does leave things looking distinctly like either he or the manager will have to go.",
      "A run of four consecutive wins cooled the immediate temperatures, but it all felt extremely precarious. The wins over Spurs and Wolves lacked any real authority. And then there were careless draws against Leeds and Fulham.",
      "There was another draw at Arsenal, though this was comfortably the most promising of their most recent stalemates. Still, this has not stopped Liverpool from coming up with a ‘contingency plan’, which might be enacted after drawing at home to Burnley and losing at Bournemouth, although an impressive win over Newcastle has been enough to knock Slot off top spot.",
      "",
      "Definitely leaving at the end of the season, and very probably before that given the extent to which this relationship now appears to be breaking down. Palace are currently matching Spurs stride for pitiful stride in freefalling towards the trapdoor.",
      "He’s currently among the names being considered by Manchester United for the permanent manager’s job that is set to be available this summer. And that’s before we mention Liverpool and Spurs. He really does deserve a crack at a big job; it’s just a shame really that they are all, in their way, so very silly.",
      "But so too are Palace. They are without a win in 12 games – a run that even includes airily dismissing the help of Dr Tottenham – and have achieved an FA Cup first as a top-flight side in managing to be eliminated by a sixth-tier one. This is all either very bad or very clever timing, depending on how you view the desirability of those various Big Six options.",
      "The prospect of Glasner walking long before his contract expires sounds very real.",
      "",
      "A 4-1 thumping of Everton followed a simply huge and wildly unexpected win over Manchester City. Had Newcastle lost that, as all pre-interlull indications suggested they would, then the spotlight would have been harsh indeed on Howe and his team. They would at that point find themselves slap bang in the muck of a relegation scrap; instead they have lifted themselves back into the mid-table morass and – with absolutely nobody in there being actually any good at all – have now managed to get themselves right to the very top of it, firmly back into the Champions League equation, via nothing more complicated than three straight wins.",
      "The 4-3 victory over Leeds was admittedly quite complicated, but also just tremendously exciting. Pure Newcastle heritage. The drab 0-0 at Wolves, not so much, while a limp home defeat to Aston Villa had Howe once again under fire before a tame surrender at Liverpool. The home defeat to Brentford has put Howe under serious pressure and up to fourth in the sack race.",
      "",
      "Has done more than could ever have been expected given the chaos he walked into. That epic pants-pulling at Anfield and joyful spangling of Tottenham should be enough to buy any manager coming into a relegation-haunted club serious time.",
      "But Mr Marinakis’ lair is never a safe place for any manager to lurk, and there have been a pair of honking defeats against Everton and a weirdly rubbish performance against Brighton as well that will have had one of 2025’s key supervillains twitching over his big red sack button once more.",
      "Looked in very serious trouble when trailing at half-time against West Ham; Forest’s first win in a Premier League game they’d been losing at half-time since 1997 was enormously well timed. Going out of the FA Cup at Wrexham not so much.",
      "Victory at Brentford gave Forest and Dyche a bit of breathing space despite West Ham’s recent improvements, but it does look like we’ve got a multi-team battle to avoid one relegation spot and that is going to make everyone twitchy. Losing at Leeds a day before West Ham beat Burnley is not the best weekend.",
      "",
      "Decision time for Burnley. There are two options available, and they prompt inevitable questions.",
      "Option one: Burnley decide to really try and beat relegation, and must decide whether they think Parker is the best man for that job.",
      "Option two: Burnley accept their overwhelmingly likely fate, and must decide whether Parker the best man to get them back up again.",
      "Parker’s job prospects likely rest on the decision. Because if it is indeed option two, he has a compelling case. Option one? He’s f*cked.",
      "But the longer he remains in place, the greater the chance that option two is the one. And right now he’s doing just enough to keep the wolves (literal and figurative) from the door.",
      "",
      "There have been good days and bad – losing at home to West Ham felt like the latter – and our whole pondering of Frank’s situation at Spurs has been about determining which of the two would eventually win out. The harrowing NLD-PSG-Fulham week was the first time he really did look f*cked.",
      "Spurs were timid and abysmal in the North London Derby, the second big London derby in a row which Frank had approached more in the manner of a League One manager attempting to avoid a paddling in the FA Cup third round than a legitimate rival facing a familiar foe.",
      "There was some encouragement in a 5-3 Champions League defeat at PSG, but even the very fact it’s possible to write the words ‘some encouragement in a 5-3 Champions League defeat’ is in its own way damning.",
      "But at least those two defeats came against what genuinely might be the two best teams in Europe at this time. With all due respect to Fulham and the sterling work of Marco Silva in recent years, they are not one of the two best teams in Europe at this time, and they were still much better than Spurs who torpedoed themselves inside the opening seven minutes to extend their extraordinarily – and in fairness largely pre-Frank – awful home record in the Premier League to three wins in 21 games since an increasingly odd-looking 4-1 win over Aston Villa in November last year.",
      "Frank’s response to the booing of Guglielmo Vicario after his hideous blunder was firmly in the ‘That’s true, but he shouldn’t say it’ category. And the way he went about it was all wrong.",
      "There should have been some acknowledgement that the booing of Vicario, unsavoury and unhelpful as it may have been, did not burst forth from a clear blue sky but instead a bubbling frustration from fans who pay among the highest ticket prices in the country to watch what is now among the worst and least effective football in the country.",
      "To instead label those supporters – and the boos did not come from a tiny minority inside the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium – not real Spurs fans was another gaffe that pushes the manager further towards the exit.",
      "Until that point we’d felt the obvious comparisons between Thomas Frank and Nuno Espirito Santo didn’t quite fit.",
      "But it’s certainly starting to look uncomfortably similar in familiar ways; the small-time approach to big games has not been well received and the fear grows that he just doesn’t understand what this job requires. The fact almost no manager in Premier League history has managed to understand what this job requires is cold comfort at this time.",
      "However, from there Spurs went to Newcastle and got a draw (albeit a ludicrous one) before they had a dominant 2-0 win against Frank’s old club Brentford, which everyone at Spurs sorely needed. It was easily their most convincing Premier League performance since the win at City on matchday two and a result that could have been even more compelling.",
      "They then pretty much secured a Champions League play-off round spot at the very least with a fine 3-0 win over Slavia Prague.",
      "But Spurs are Spurs, so they followed that with the worst performance yet of Frank’s reign in a truly inept and miserable 3-0 defeat at Nottingham Forest.",
      "Bringing Joao Palhinha and Ben Davies on to try and hold on to a 2-0 defeat and not even managing that feels uncomfortably like the infamous Nuno Moment against Manchester United.",
      "Have reached the kind of state where a dreadful home defeat to a very poor Liverpool is being dressed up as ‘signs of encouragement’. In reality, it might have been the worst possible result; still a defeat, yet one that risks extending the increasingly obviously doomed reign of the latest manager to be chewed up and spat out by the country’s most preposterous football club.",
      "The win at Palace was welcome if deeply unconvincing, while the sheer small-timery of a mind-meltingly dull goalless draw at Brentford really might have hurt Frank more than any of the many, many defeats. Or at least we thought that before they somehow contrived to Dr Tottenham their way to a 3-2 defeat at a Bournemouth side on a horrific streak while Frank was holding an Arsenal-branded cup.",
      "That and the fact the winning goal was scored by Antoine Semenyo with his last kick for Bournemouth before toddling off to pass the next two years on Man City’s bench were just the latest reminders that Spurs are a club where ridiculous things happen routinely, and that Frank simply isn’t and never will be capable of dealing with that.",
      "And in a strange way, that’s to his credit. It does look like Spurs are determined to try and muddle through the season with the obviously doomed Frank at the wheel, and in an odd way his immediate future might have more to do with West Ham than Spurs. It is West Ham’s (admittedly Spurs-assisted) resurgence and with it the very real danger of relegation that might finally get the Spurs board to see what has been alarmingly obvious to the fans for many weeks now.",
      "The fact a draw at Burnley appears to be enough to keep him in place for another week is damning. And if that got him a week, it seems only fair that another draw against Man City gets him the rest of the season. Losing against an in-form Manchester United is also probably fine because Cristian Romero.",

And this is based on the stance that I DO believe he’s an Arsenal fan, albeit a critical one but, we’re allowed to be critical of our teams and it must be widespread the amount of people who have love / hate relationships with their teams.",

      "Despite the remarkable turnaround under Carrick, which has pushed United into the top four and the Champions League qualification spots, Ferdinand insists his former club should wait until the end of the decision to make a final decision on Carrick’s future.",
      "“I know a lot of people are asking if Carrick should go on now and get the Man United job – it’s getting hard to say no,” Ferdinand said on his YouTube channel.",
      "“In the manner he’s winning games, it’s hard to say, ‘I don’t think he should get it, I don’t think he’s experienced enough, it’s another job for old players, is he the right stature to be the manager?’. Well, the truth will be in the pudding.",
      "“No, I wouldn’t give it to him right now. I know Michael, played with him for many years, grew up at West Ham with him, was one of his good mates within the United team, but I can sit here comfortably and say I don’t think he should be given the job right now.",
      "“Let him go through to the end of the season, get to the end of the season then take stock and make a decision.",

      "Premier League clubs received a total of £2.83billion last season, which was comprised of six payments through the division’s ‘central revenue system’, something the Premier League says ‘ensures the most equitable distribution of funds of any major European league’.",
      "Liverpool were paid £174.9m as champions – short of Manchester City’s record £176.2m in 2022/23 – while Newcastle received just over £160m to chuck into their PSR black hole.",
      "Southampton were handed £109.2m for their efforts in finishing a distant bottom. It pays to be in the Premier League.",
      "Some of those payments are fixed. All 20 clubs automatically receive around £96.9m through an equal share distributed based on both the domestic (£29.8m in 2024/25) and international (£59.2m in 2024/25) broadcast deals – those TV rights are lucrative for a reason – as well as £7.9m each from central commercial revenue streams.",
      "The rest is variable, based on where clubs finish and how often their games are selected for broadcast.",
      "",
      "The Premier League merit payments are distributed on a sliding scale from 1st to 20th, made up of combined earnings from domestic and international broadcast deals.",
      "For the 2024/25 season, the difference in prize money was around £2.7m per position. Southampton were given as much for finishing bottom, all the way up to champions Liverpool receiving £53.1m. It basically helped pay for 97.4% of Giorgi Mamardashvili and Jeremie Frimpong.",
      "That can be expected to fluctuate with inflation and other factors – it was around £2.8m per position in 2023/24 – but it offers a rough guide as to what clubs should expect to earn this season.",

      "The only other part of the prize money which is not fixed and shared equally are the facility fees, which are based on how many times each club has been selected for television.",
      "In 2024/25, Liverpool had 30 games televised in the UK, for which they received £24.9m in facility fees. Arsenal had 29 matches and were paid £24.2m, while Manchester United (28 games for £23.4m), Aston Villa (27 games for £22.6m) and Chelsea (26 games for £21.8m) were televised frequently and rewarded handsomely.",
      "Ipswich were shown on the fewest occasions and received £8.9m in facility fees for their 10 live televised UK fixtures.",
      "This can lead to discrepancies in terms of those variable payments. Manchester United’s prize money after finishing 15th last season was £136.2m, more than the four clubs immediately above them – West Ham (£130.9m in 14th), Everton (£131.8m in 13th), Crystal Palace (£136.1m in 12th) and Fulham (£135.5m in 11th) – as Ruben Amorim’s side were picked for far more live TV games.",
      "Spurs were another massive outlier, earning more in 17th (£127.8m) than Wolves did in 16th (£123.1m) in part because they had nine more games picked for live UK broadcast.",

      "But the facility fee payments are tied to how many times a team is picked for broadcast by Sky and TNT, with both broadcasters having made their picks up to before Boxing Day. One game generally translates to roughly £0.83m but does fluctuate.",
      "Brentford, Chelsea, Everton, Liverpool, Newcastle and Spurs were the biggest winners from the latest round of picks up to March 22 with three more games each.",
      "Aston Villa, Burnley, Crystal Palace and Fulham were only selected once more – on the March midweek when every team will be televised.",
      "1st) Manchester United (26 games televised live in the UK) – worth around £21.8m in 2024/25",

      "Manchester United continue to find beauty in simplicity under Michael Carrick, but Thomas Frank and Cristian Romero surely cannot carry on at Spurs.",
      "The Spurs hoodoo is over and Manchester United have a firm grip on Champions League qualification.",
      "But what of Frank and Romero’s futures in north London? It’s not looking great.",
      "",
      "1) Prepare yourselves for three days of the most wild and tiresome haircut discourse involving Manchester United since Garth Crooks conquered his Paul Pogba obsession.",
      "",
      "2) That is testament to the impact of Michael Carrick, whose simplification of a seemingly maddening equation continues to impress.",
      "There are no square pegs in round holes, no-one crowbarred in with the system given precedence to the players. They have a sturdy defence, a reliable midfield and a productive attack, all being asked to do relatively straightforward things in front of a competent keeper.",
      "They have had the composite parts to do this all season, but a coach who specifically chose not to. And that will never not be funny.",
      "Yet even then, Darren Fletcher struggled to make sense of it in his winless pair of games, so Carrick deserves the utmost credit. Unfortunately, so do the bumbling suits who appointed him.",
      "",
      "3) It is the first time since February 2024 that Manchester United have won four consecutive Premier League games. The scorers in a run which saw Wolves, West Ham, Aston Villa and Luton all vanquished were Marcus Rashford, Rasmus Hojlund, Scott McTominay, Alejandro Garnacho and Kobbie Mainoo.",
      "More of them play for Napoli two years later than for Manchester United.",
      "If Ruben Amorim had seen out January then Barcelona and Chelsea would have possessed more of those players than the Red Devils too.",
      "But the Portuguese had to be sacked as much to release Mainoo from his baffling prison as to rescue the club’s performances, results and dignity.",
      "Mainoo was brilliant again, creating more chances than any player bar the absurd Bruno Fernandes, having more touches than any player aside from the Butt and Scholes-silencing Lisandro Martinez, and just generally patrolling midfield with a quiet authority.",
      "It is difficult not to watch him excel in a midfield two without wondering what the f*** the previous manager was thinking.",
      "",
      "4) It is even tougher to watch Cristian Romero without wondering what the f*** he is thinking – even when his latest case of avoidable and self-destructive head loss is so predictable.",
      "",
      "5) But it is very Spurs for their captain to rant on social media about their ‘unbelievable but true and disgraceful’ lack of available players, before proceeding to get sent off not even half an hour into their next fixture when the game was in the balance and the visitors had acquitted themselves well at Old Trafford.",
      "He might struggle blaming the Lewis family for his upcoming four-match suspension, including a potentially ruinous north London derby.",
      "Romero has long since been a liability and as justifiable as he and many others may feel his pop at the board was for the lack of January reinforcements to a threadbare squad, his words are frequently undermined by his actions.",
      "And they make him far from irreplaceable. Spurs are not blessed with many particularly saleable assets, or at least players who can command a worthwhile enough fee to cash in on without the entire team falling in on itself.",
      "Romero’s cons far outweigh his positives at this point; there are cheaper players out there whose ceilings might be lower, but at least their floors aren’t made of infuriating lava.",
      "Spurs need reliability at this stage and their captain guarantees the opposite.",
      "",
      "6) Thomas Frank was never likely to enter his post-match media duties holding aloft a bloody captain’s band on the disembodied arm of Romero. But of course he basically absolved the Argentinean of blame and insisted there were “no regrets” about making giving someone so consistently reckless and daft a leadership role.",
      "“He’s apologised to his team-mates in the changing room. I think he’s one of the most important players,” Frank said, adding that “Cuti clearly tried to go for the ball. Unfortunately, the way the rules is, it’s then a red”.",
      "That argument might wash in ordinary circumstances, but not when discussing someone who has been sent off more times than any other Premier League player in all competitions since making his debut.",
      "It had far less to do with “the way the rules is”, and far more to do with a player who routinely breaks them and faces barely any consequence for doing so.",
      "Again, Frank’s hands are tied slightly in terms of how he handles it publicly, but it is tough to envisage him coming down much harder on Romero behind the scenes. The controversy earlier in the week was “dealt with internally” and this felt like a child testing the boundaries of a weak parent even further to see what they can get away with.",
      "",
      "7) And this press conference exchange after the defeat is exceptional.",
      "Journalist: “It’s Romero’s fourth suspension of the season, you’ll lose him for four games and he’s close to a fifth suspension for yellow cards, how do you take out the recklessness while keeping the aggression?”",
      "Frank: “I think if you look at how many red cards he has had, it’s not like he had that many throughout his career. You know, you play with passion and you play with aggression. And there’s a fine line when you do that.”",
      "Journalist: “He’s got the most red cards of all Premier League players since he arrived at the club.”",
      "Frank: “At the club? Yeah, but not in the Premier League.”",
      "Journalist: “Of all Premier League players, I think.”",
      "Frank: “Of Premier League players? OK, I didn’t know that.”",
      "He does himself precisely no favours.",
      "",
      "8) It changed the game. The shot count was seven to five in favour of the hosts by that point, with possession roughly equal and no clear better team emerging.",
      "Spurs did not have another effort on goal until Xavi Simons whistled one just wide in the 57th minute – from a poor Luke Shaw pass with no team-mate within 20 yards of the Dutchman – and were a goal down soon after.",
      "Yet only a clever set-piece routine broke down that Spurs low block before they felt compelled to open up and try to nick one on the counter in the final ten minutes.",
      "Bruno Fernandes’ short corner found an intelligent Mainoo run parallel to the front post, with his pass around the shoulder seeking out Bryan Mbeumo on the edge of the area. The placed finish perfectly matched the two balls which preceded it.",
      "It wasn’t Arsenal scoring from a header so there need be no crisis declared about the state of the sport. But it was wonderful, and further proof that the most effective way of breaching a defence lies in those moves which can be devised and perfected to mimic actual in-game situations most accurately on the training ground, and are almost certain to happen a handful of times across any match.",
      "It is a damning indictment on any team which chooses not to try and maximise them.",
      "",
      "9) There is some sympathy for Frank, who was let down so thoroughly by his captain after half an hour, then made a triple substitution to bring on two forwards and a Yves Bissouma for the final ten minutes, before conceding a second almost instantly.",
      "Mathys Tel even ranked joint-second for dribbles behind Simons, while conjuring up only Spurs’ second shot with ten men in the fifth minute of stoppage time.",
      "They had a man advantage for an hour and were playing at home to relegation fodder but Manchester United seeing that result out so smoothly felt deeply unsettling. It is only 75 days since they lost in similar conditions.",
      "",
      "10) Frank might even try and spin some vindication from this, considering known transfer target and former Brentford favourite Mbeumo has scored against Spurs home and away while thriving on a bigger stage.",
      "Antoine Semenyo is another who got away – having never felt particularly close. They are flourishing but have also been given the platform and framework in which to do so; Spurs have neither that attacking structure nor individual quality currently.",
      "",
      "11) The game state was obviously skewed but this was Carrick’s first win as a Premier League manager with more than 50 per cent possession. He has overseen two bouts of late drama against Arsenal and Fulham, a deserved rope-a-dope victory over Manchester City and now a consummately professional dispatching of Spurs.",
      "Long may it continue, if only to force Gary Neville and Roy Keane down from such stupidly definitive stances.",
      "",
      "12) Souza seemed bright on his Premier League debut, despite the slightly sub-optimal circumstances. He will have to be, considering Destiny Udogie succumbed to injury and joined Djed Spence on the sidelines to further deplete Spurs’ stock of left-backs.",
      "He should do well in the Championship anyway.",
      "",
      "13) Frank has not reached for the ‘Spurs finished 17th last season’ button for some time, perhaps realising the futility when he has them in 14th and can hardly recycle domestic failure into European glory the same way Ange Postecoglou did.",
      "But this is a relegation battle. Spurs are level on points with Crystal Palace and Leeds, three clear of Nottingham Forest and only six above West Ham. They cannot win at home, have not won in the league this year, and neither their manager nor the players seem to possess the mentality or skillset necessary for what lies ahead.",
      "Even in keeping Brentford up – a remarkable achievement, to be sure – Frank never really had them in a position of genuine danger. The Bees never ended a single Premier League matchday in a position lower than 16th under him; Spurs are spiralling that far down and very possibly further.",
      "",
      "14) Fernandes is an interesting case study to consider when it comes to Romero.",
      "There have been at least a couple of calls for the Portuguese to be stripped of the Manchester United captaincy over the years. His petulance can be enraging and his demeanour exasperating.",
      "Fernandes became a burden last season with three red cards, including in a defeat to Spurs.",
      "Yet he has been phenomenal for months and, really, with a handful of exceptions, years. He will still self-sabotage at times – although that tendency has certainly been less prevalent of late – but what he brings to the team far outstrips what he is capable of taking away.",
      "His finish to make it 2-0 and end the game as a contest was glorious improvisation from a player at his peak. Fernandes has six goals and 13 assists this season, and tore Spurs to shreds with eight shots and six key passes here – the most by a player in a single Premier League game since October 2024.",
      "",
      "15) As far as rallying cries go, “We can’t run away from [the fact] we haven’t won enough in the Premier League. But there is no other alternative than keep going, which we will do, of course,” is a generational effort from Frank.",
      "They host Newcastle on Tuesday, a team almost as awful away as Spurs are at home in a true meeting of resistible force and moveable object.",
      "Then after that it’s Arsenal, and the prospect of the Gunners celebrating another victory en route to the Premier League title with a 90-minute chant of “Arsenal boys, we’re on a bender, Thomas Frank is a silver member”.",
      "Sacking him before then won’t stop that, but it might be the kindest thing to do.",
      "",
      "16) Manchester United have lost one of their last 13 Premier League games and are three points off title challengers Aston Villa. What an absurd season they have had.",
      "Thomas Frank has clung on to his Spurs job through several awful defeats, so we’re shocked he’s favourite after West Ham relegated Scott Parker’s Burnley.",
      "Tottenham Hotspur captain Cristian Romero is ‘hot-headed and impulsive’ – so who should Thomas Frank pass the armband on to? Richarlison…obviously.",
      "Tottenham Hotspur captain Cristian Romero will be banned for four matches after being sent off during his side’s 2-0 loss against Manchester United.",
      "Michael Carrick’s chances of being Manchester United’s next permanent manager are ever-increasing, with Cristian Romero, Ruben Amorim and co. helping…",

      "This makes this fixture incredibly difficult to forecast, but our Dave Tickner calling a red card for Cristian Romero was his safest of his ten pre-match predictions.",
      "Following his full-blooded challenge on Tottenham’s board due to their lack of January transfer business, Romero was equally as committed with his needless follow-through on Casemiro to be sent off inside half an hour against Man Utd.",
      "It was as utterly idiotic as expected from a player who cannot be trusted to lead this broken Spurs ship without having a brainless act of his own to sink them further.",
      "Before Romero’s latest calamitous moment, Spurs were actually a match for Man Utd as the two sides exchanged good chances, but the hosts took control thereafter.",
      "There was more evidence of United’s defensive shakiness displayed against Fulham here, but everyone associated with the Red Devils will happily accept having that weakness because their fabled DNA has finally come to the fore again.",
      "READ: Is Man Utd ‘no d**kheads’ policy finally reaping rewards?",
      "In his brief time in charge, interim manager Michael Carrick has been faultless as Man Utd deservedly won four straight Premier League games (supporter Frank Ilett is so close to having that haircut) against Manchester City, Arsenal, Fulham and now Spurs via performances that have been a throwback to the United of old.",
      "But Carrick has been dealt a very good hand by INEOS, which is mainly because former boss Ruben Amorim took them so far away from their deep-rooted principles that only a few simple decisions were needed to spark an immediate upturn.",
      "This has mainly been the long-awaited recall of Kobbie Mainoo, who has remarkably taken no time to return to his masterful best despite his long exile, the switch to a four-man defence and a notable increase in United’s intensity both in and out of possession.",
      "Man Utd are obviously lacking in certain positions that will be addressed in the summer, but there was always the feeling that this group of players is capable of much more than was shown under Amorim, and recent showings have underlined that view.",
      "This was certainly not the best of United’s recent performances, but they were still far too much for Spurs in their current sorry form under Thomas Frank and could have won by a significant scoreline had they not played with their food.",
      "United took the lead only nine minutes after Romero’s dismissal, with summer signing Bryan Mbeumo scoring his ninth Premier League goal of the season via one of those straight off the training ground corners that are always very satisfying when they come off.",
      "One of the many negative hallmarks of Amorim’s reign was Man Utd’s wastefulness as they often missed big chances to improve their Champions League hopes, and they ran the risk of falling into this trap against Spurs as the scoreline remained 1-0 heading into the closing stages.",
      "But it also felt inevitable that Spurs would have been picked off at some stage and United’s second goal came almost instantly after Frank made an attacking triple change for the final ten minutes.",
      "Just as Mainoo has been a revelation alongside revitalised Casemiro in centre-midfield, the same can be said for Fernandes, who has unsurprisingly been far more influential since returning to his favoured advanced role under Carrick.",
      "He has often been the provider in recent matches, but he converted a chance for United’s second against Spurs as he deftly converted a brilliant cross from Diogo Dalot. It is now even clearer than it was before that the Red Devils cannot sacrifice their captain in a summer rebuild; he’s simply too influential to be let go.",
      "Fernandes and Mainoo may well end up contributing to Carrick landing the Man Utd job permanently in the summer, with the win against Spurs adding to the feeling that INEOS will be put in an impossible and familiar position regarding their next permanent manager appointment.",

      "“I mean, Ratcliffe would be lynched right now if he didn’t give Carrick the job as we sit today, but I think there’s still a long way to go.",
      "“But nevertheless, that solution was staring right in front of them, and it didn’t need the whole Erik Ten Hag, [Ruben] Amorim experiment that they’ve been through and the pain they’ve been through.",
      "“Sometimes football is pretty simple, and I think Man United’s success was always going to be basically a simple formula of working hard through youth, getting an identity and loyalty to players and the club and the fan base, and it seems to be coming back.”",
      "A report from Football Insider’s Pete O’Rourke also claims Carrick will have interest from elsewhere, with AFC Bournemouth, Crystal Palace and Fulham ‘ready to beat’ Man Utd to the manager in the summer.",
      "“He’s obviously building a strong case to maybe have that interim spell turned into a permanent manager’s job come the summer with Manchester United. I don’t think United are rushing into anything just yet,” O’Rourke said.",
      "“But look, if there’s a Premier League club looking for a new manager there, and if Michael Carrick is available, he’s showing he knows how to get wins in the Premier League.",
      "“If he gets Man United back in the Champions League, he’s going to be a hot commodity for a lot of clubs.",
      "“He’s proved that he can do it in the Premier League as well and obviously managing a club like Manchester United shows that he can handle the pressure as well.",

      "Send your thoughts to theeditor@football365.com…",
      "",
      "Criticisms of modern Arsenal all fail to understand the underlying reasons the club has become the way it is. Let’s address the criticisms one at a time.",
      "“They’re boring!”: They’re constantly up against parked buses blockading the opponent’s goal so they can’t really play fluid attacking football. It’s the defensive blockades that other teams employ that results in Arsenal games being a grind in the league, in the Champions League things are quite different since the opposition are not as conservative. Besides, for ages Arsenal were derided for failing to break low blocks. Now we’ve found solutions to them through set pieces but people whinge about it being dull as if we should be playing like Brazil ’70 against rigid defensive blockades.",
      "“They’ve spent £1b pounds!”: Remember all the years of austerity after we moved to the new stadium? We couldn’t spend like Russian mobsters and repressive totalitarian petrostates as we had to tighten the belt. Everyone mocked us for being cheapskates then. The massive spending is the result of over a decade of austerity to pay off the stadium debt. Meanwhile City and Chelsea have been able to spending lavishly the entire time, resulting in the inflated transfer fees and wages which Arsenal now also have to pay. But go on, mock us for adapting to the market created by the vile oligarchs and dictatorships.",
      "“They use dirty tactics!”: We’re no worse than any other team in terms of the usual diving, pushing and shoving and gamesmanship. Remember all those years that Arsenal were laughed at for being “soft” and not being able to handle rough rugby teams like Stoke? And now that we’ve stepped up our resilience and developed some steel you guys try to criticise us for that. Damned if we do, damned if we don’t. Just admit that you’re rattled because we’re no longer soft.",
      "“Arteta is annoying and unlikeable!”: He’s no more annoying than any other high profile manager. We’ve had the likes of Klopp and Pep going ballistic on the touchline over decisions but because they don’t manage Arsenal they’re passed off as passionate. Meanwhile Arteta tries to inject more competitive energy into a team that was frequently found lacking in the past and he’s immediately perceived as some sort of deranged lunatic. He knows that Arsenal needs to be more steadfast and streetsmart in order to win titles, we failed to win major titles because we didn’t have these qualities. He’s got to have some edge and intensity to make sure the team is competitive, just like Pep, Klopp, Mourinho and Fergie.",

      "Greetings. Andy in the mailbox asked:",
      "“What is Stewie Griffin going to have to write in about when Arsenal, the Viking clogger, El Pulizon, and all the MAGA-lite actually close it out?”",
      "It’s a simple one, this Andy. First off, I will congratulate their delirium. Much like the High school loudmouth boasting about losing his virginity at 47, despite being richer than any eligible bachelor out there…it’s quite the flex. As is Stewie’s sardonic nature, I would also have to ask Arsenal’s unhinged MAGA-Lite koolaid warriors, to revisit a few key topical matters.",
      "When Mourinho’s Chelsea was successful, Arsenal fans derided that success, calling it “Financial doping” (he spent money on players, something Arsenal are apparently loath to do). They also in unison – and we all remember, receipts are there – called Mourinho a “chequebook manager”. Given Arteta has spent over £1bn to “build” his title-winning automatons, do the same rules apply? Or will it be MAGA Revisionism IT NEVER HAPPENED, HUNTER BIDEN LAPTOP etc etc…",
      "Arsenal fans insisted that it was impossible to “financially compete” with richer clubs. You apparently couldn’t ever win a title when faced with much richer behemoths. I spent years asking how eg Klopp did it at Liverpool, and Dortmund before that, etc. So will they acknowledge it was intellectual dishonesty all along, flat out lies and dissembling to excuse failure? Ooooor will it be RADICAL FAKE NEWS MEDIA WITH AN AGENDA, TERRIBLE FOR THIS COUNTRY! Etc etc…",
      "Final one this: given the borderline erotic eulogies Gooners dish out towards El Pulizon, I have to state the obvious here: for years, we were told that successful winning managers like Jose’s Chelsea, then Hiddink’s Chelsea etc were “soulless” and that Arsenal fans “would hate to win that way”. Hence, a mantra from the years of Wenger failure aka “the Arsenal way” was born. I think it had something to do with playing pretty football that helps you batter a set of clueless kids, but shit your undies and get beat 10-2, 8-2 etc. the minute you face a serious team.\nIt also gave way to a number of (virtual) trophies: the Calendar Year trophy, the “Unbeaten v Big Six” trophy, the “FFP” trophy, the “most points in the PL over three years” trophy and of course the biggest clout of all, the Top 4 Trophy – the one where you perpetually show off about qualifying for a competition you have zero chance of winning. Like a lifetime Celibate showing off about spending a night in a Travelodge with Rihanna – yeah mate, enjoy Trivial Pursuit.",
      "But we’ve now suddenly, seen a very curious shift. Arsenal are diabolical to watch. Enduring a full 90 minutes of that dross is enough to make you want to migrate (if those racist plebs from Farage’s Reform lot are determined to enforce anti-immigration, making any foreigner sit through 90 minutes of Viking Clogger and Friends simulate entertainment is enough to make anyone self-deport).",
      "Now though? Arsenal fans are all about WINNING! Apparently, playing aesthetic football is diametrically opposed to winning! You see, if one spends over £1bn then you automatically have to deploy Taliban Tactics. Not like Pep, Mancini, Ancelotti, Fergie, Klopp et al ever won PL titles playing enterprising football eh!",
      "Now, “winning is all that counts”. The problem for them, is that both things can’t be true. You can’t spend years preaching frenetically about “oil money”, “financial doping”, “boring football” etc etc – and then suddenly – pretend you never cared for those things, when it suits!!! Why haven’t we heard about the PGMOL DEEP STATE in a while? I mean, the refs literally had to apologise for farcical decisions that have gone in Arsenal’s favour eg away to Everton. Not a word.

      "This has been an odd season in that every team, except perhaps Arsenal, has had a rocky patch or patches – and even Arsenal had a little wobble – ending up in a barrage of ‘manager x’ out stories.",
      "The reality is that a 3 game win streak will accelerate you up the table and the reverse is true.",
      "The latest being Howe out. Newcastle have always been a likeable team (even when not a fan.) When they are hot, they are on fire. But when not on fire, they can be woeful. The problem is that it is hard (impossible?) to play a brand of high tempo football throughout the Premier league. More true today than even when Klopp tried it in his first full season and ran into a wall after the Dec/Jan fixture pile up.",
      "Today, teams not in Europe still have sufficient funds, because of the Premier league payouts, to acquire decent enough players with more time to prepare and recover that only large squads with quality players can break through the winter period – or focus on fewer competitions. Either injury or overplaying key players, decimates teams. Only Arsenal and City right now have those squads. Chelsea’s is massive, but either still have a few holes or are raw. Villa, still a little short. Liverpool, still need to replace a few aging players and lack depth across all areas right now. United have a decent squad now and are benefitting from the extra time to prepare (along with round pegging.)",
      "Point is, Newcastle’s squad still relies on relatively few players and, being in Europe, can’t sustain the high tempo game for a whole season. A game which on its day is brilliant to watch and devastating. But even then, once they tire in the 60th minute plus, become too open.",
      "Point is, Howe does need to change his game plan and style. I am sure a lot of Newcastle fans would do their nut, if they played that slow, methodical, ball retention build up against low blocks that Arsenal/City/Liverpool have adopted – relying on the brilliance of one or two (expensive to buy) players to come to the rescue. In an effort to ease the workload across a long, tiring season.",
      "It’s hard unless you are City, to get ‘bargain’ high quality players because of the lure of Guardiola and the promise of always being in the CL and in with a chance of trophies. Even well run clubs with big revenues (Liverpool) have to pay over the top, sell players and lose out to bigger fish. So Newcastle are in tough.",

      "Three wins on the bounce under the interim stewardship of Michael Carrick have raised spirits inside Old Trafford of late. Yet hardened Manchester United fans will be regarding their recent rise with extreme caution, given the club’s habit of brief revivals followed by long, grinding reminders that the problems run far deeper than a promising run of results.",
      "On the pitch, optimism has become a fragile, short-term currency. Off it, the same pattern holds true – flashes of progress masking a broader sense that United are still struggling to modernise at the pace demanded by the modern game, whether that’s in recruitment, governance or, increasingly, sustainability.",
      "For a football club whose brand is built on global reach and historical dominance, United’s environmental sustainability record reads more like a cautious compliance exercise than a statement of leadership.",
      "Find out how you can help your team rise up the Pledgeball League table",
      "Across elite football and the Premier League in particular, sustainability has moved from benign corporate social responsibility into strategic priority, with clubs setting ambitious carbon reduction targets, embedding environmental governance and publicly reporting progress.",
      "In contrast, United’s environmental performance – long present on paper but limited in ambition – now risks making the club appear a follower rather than a leader in one of the defining challenges of the modern age.",
      "Manchester United’s environmental journey formally dates back well over a decade. The club’s Environment, Energy & Carbon Reduction Programme is longstanding, and United’s environmental management system has been certified to the ISO 14001 standard, reflecting a structured approach to continual improvement across operations.",
      "United also maintain a zero waste to landfill policy and reported that a significant portion of their waste – hundreds of tonnes – is recycled or diverted to energy recovery annually, alongside food waste being processed into biogas and reused where possible. United engage with local conservation groups for biodiversity efforts at their Carrington training centre and operate renewable energy measures, including heat pumps and biofuel use for match-day generators and grounds-keeping equipment.",
      "Sport Positive Leagues records show that between April 2022 and March 2023 over half of United’s energy came from renewable sources, and the club’s Carbon Trust Standard has been maintained through at least 14 years of year-on-year carbon reduction goals.",
      "Yet in 2026, that résumé – while positive – looks decidedly modest compared with many of United’s rivals, both within England and across Europe.",
      "The crucial difference lies not in isolated initiatives but in structural targets, transparency and overarching strategy. Although United have laid early groundwork on developing a net-zero strategy, Sport Positive Leagues notes that definitive net-zero targets, milestones and a formal governance framework are still under development, rather than already established and publicly reported. In other words, United are planning their ambition rather than executing it on a measurable, timebound basis.",
      "That contrast is most apparent when you look at clubs such as Liverpool. Since launching The Red Way strategy in 2021, Liverpool have embedded environmental and social impact deeply within its operations. The Red Way sets clear goals – including a 50 per cent reduction in absolute emissions by 2030 and achieving net-zero by 2040 – with detailed inventories covering Scope 1, 2 and 3 travel emissions.",
      "In 2023-24, Liverpool reported cutting total emissions and using 96 per cent renewable or low-carbon energy across club sites, investing in Sustainable Aviation Fuel to eliminate emissions from some domestic flights and utilising low-carbon biofuel for team buses. Liverpool’s progress has also been recognised with independent awards, including the Transformation category at the 2025 Sport Positive Summit, underscoring the breadth and depth of their sustainability commitment.",
      "Did you know, 100,000 tonnes of sportswear ends up in landfill every year in the UK alone?",
      "Manchester City offer another stark comparison. City’s 2024-25 sustainability reporting outlines tangible results: 25 per cent reduction in CO₂ emissions across the year, Scope 1 and 2 operations carbon-neutral, over one megawatt of solar generation on-site, significant water use reduction and expanded sustainable transport options for fans. Crucially, City have publicly committed to achieving net carbon-zero by 2030, a clear, relatively near-term target that drives investment and reporting.",
      "Even outside the top two Manchester clubs, peers are stepping up. Tottenham Hotspur became the first Premier League club to join the UN-backed Sports for Nature Framework, bolstering biodiversity protection and pledging to halve emissions by 2030 and reach net-zero by 2040. Independent sustainability rankings for 2025-26 place Brighton & Hove Albion as the greenest Premier League club overall, based on factors such as renewable energy use, waste diversion, water reuse and local engagement.",
      "Part of United’s catch-up problem reflects the club’s relative lack of transparent, clearly reported metrics and verified targets. Independent benchmarking, such as Premier League sustainability assessments, consistently rank United in the middle or lower tiers among the 20 clubs, largely due to limited disclosures and absence of formal net-zero timelines. While United’s ISO certification and long-running reduction programme demonstrate commitment, they lack the strategic framing around science-aligned, independently verified goals that others now publish.",
      "Operational emissions data – whether analysed through third-party assessments or club reporting – also highlights the scale of the task. Analysis suggests that the so-called “Big Six” clubs collectively account for a majority of the Premier League’s carbon emissions, with United often registering among the largest contributors due to the sheer scale of their facilities and activities, including matchday operations, training and support travel. Such findings reinforce how central the Red Devils are to the league’s environmental footprint and why their leadership on reduction strategies matters – not just for their own sustainability but for the league’s collective progress.",
      "So what would it take for United to modernise from an environmental perspective? The most immediate step would be formalising and publishing a robust net-zero strategy, complete with science-based targets, interim milestones and regular third-party verification. This should cover not only operational emissions (Scope 1 and 2) but also Scope 3 emissions, including travel and supply-chain impacts, which represent the largest portion of most football clubs’ footprints.",
      "Regular sustainability reporting – in line with frameworks such as the UN Sports for Climate Action or Science Based Targets initiative – would vastly increase transparency and accountability. Intensifying investment in on-site renewable energy generation, sustainable transport infrastructure for fans and staff, and fan engagement programmes on travel choices would further align United with best practice.",
      "Embedding sustainability at executive board level – giving dedicated leadership authority and resources – would signal a shift from compliance-oriented action to strategic ambition. Ultimately, for a club with one of the world’s largest fanbases and richest brands, sustainability isn’t just a niche CSR endeavour: it’s part of safeguarding the institution’s future in a world where environmental performance increasingly informs reputations, commercial partnerships and fan loyalty.",
      "Manchester United’s sustainability story has thus far been one of legacy process rather than bold transformation – an ethos that has also seen them tread water on the pitch for more than a decade. The next era demands vision, measured progress and a willingness to compete off the pitch with the same intensity displayed on it. In that race, the Red Devils can no longer afford to lag behind the league’s green giants.",
      "To learn more about Pledgeball and how you can pledge to help your club shoot up the sustainability standings, visit Pledgeball.org.",
      "Manchester United continue to find beauty in simplicity under Michael Carrick, but Thomas Frank and Cristian Romero surely cannot carry on at Spurs.",
      "Pep Guardiola may wish that Manchester City had spent more on players, but he can’t complain at their willingness to pay big wages…",
      "To celebrate National 80s Day – it’s a thing, apparently – test your knowledge of football through the decade. Or ask your dad…",
      "Sandro Tonali ignored journalists in the mixed zone TWICE – so can only possibly be leaving Newcastle after being ‘courted by’ close friend Pep Guardiola.",
      "The Newcastle fan sentiment towards Eddie Howe has turned: he has done a phenomenal job but no longer is he the definitive best man for it. Is Jesse Marsch?",
      "The Premier League weekend begins and ends with a couple of highly promising opportunities for nonsense, with more good stuff in between."

      "According to reports, Manchester United legend Cristiano Ronaldo has issued a transfer ‘ultimatum’ to Al Nassr chiefs as his boycott continues.",
      "Ronaldo joined Saudi Pro League side Al Nassr at the start of 2023 on a free transfer. This move followed the mutual termination of his Man Utd contract at the end of 2022.",
      "The 40-year-old has 111 goals in his 127 appearances for Al Nassr in all competitions, but there have been reports of his unhappiness over the past year.",
      "Ahead of the expiry of his contract last year, it was reported that Ronaldo was not satisfied at Al Nassr following the failure to win the Saudi Pro League and/or the AFC Champions League and could join Al-Hilal or another Club World Cup team.",
      "Ronaldo eventually opted to pen a contract extension with Al Nassr, but he is currently on strike after reportedly taking issue with the board’s alleged lack of backing in the transfer market.",
      "READ: Big Weekend: Liverpool v Man City, Man United, Oliver Glasner, Igor Thiago",
      "The former Man Utd and Real Madrid star missed Monday’s game against Al-Riyadh and he was also absent for Friday’s match against Al-Ittihad.",
      "On Thursday evening, a spokesperson for the Saudi Pro League commented on the ongoing Ronaldo situation.",
      "“The Saudi Pro League is structured around a simple principle: every club operates independently under the same rules,” a league spokesperson said.",
      "“Clubs have their own boards, their own executives and their own football leadership. Decisions on recruitment, spending and strategy sit with those clubs, within a financial framework designed to ensure sustainability and competitive balance. That framework applies equally across the league.",
      "“Cristiano has been fully engaged with Al Nassr since his arrival and has played an important role in the club’s growth and ambition. Like any elite competitor, he wants to win. But no individual – however significant – determines decisions beyond their own club.",
      "“Recent transfer activity demonstrates that independence clearly. One club strengthened in a particular way. Another chose a different approach. Those were club decisions, taken within approved financial parameters.",
      "“The competitiveness of the league speaks for itself. With only a few points separating the top four, the title race is very much alive. That level of balance reflects a system that is working as intended.",
      "“The focus remains on football – on the pitch, where it belongs – and on maintaining a credible, competitive competition for players and fans.”",
      "Now, a report from talkSPORT claims Ronaldo has issued a transfer ‘ultimatum’ to Al Nassr as he is ‘prepared to leave’ if his situation does not improve.",
      "It is also noted that he could move to Turkey in the summer.",
      "The report claims: ‘Ronaldo’s Al Nassr contract includes a €50m release clause and talkSPORT understands Turkish clubs are monitoring the situation ahead of the summer.",
      "‘It is not thought Ronaldo will boycott games indefinitely, knowing his absence is detrimental to Al Nassr’s title chances and lack of game time in a World Cup year is also not ideal. However, his decision to sit out matches is supported by the club’s board.’",
      "‘The forward is convinced Al Hilal are getting preferential treatment and he was particularly angry that they strengthened their squad by bringing in players such as Karim Benzema during the January window.’",

      "“People may be shocked by that but it all depends on who they have as manager in the summer because they’ve got it wrong so many times before and it looks like they have got it right at the moment.”",

They’re flying high in the Champions League but there are stiffer tests to come in that competition.”",

      "‘This possibility could be realized if the white club is interested in him again and the soccer player is not happy in Manchester, as long as a price similar to the one the English have paid now, about 50-55 million euros is paid.’",
      "It’s thought such a sale would be welcomed by Untied as it ‘would make it possible to balance accounts and reorder a squad that is still in the process of being rebuilt’, with the report adding that Yoro himself ‘would not look against a change of scenery if the sports proposal is convincing’.",
      "Maguire’s future remains up in the air as his contract is up at the end of the season, meaning Yoro may just need to be patient to force his way into the United team, but Matthijs de Ligt will provide further competition when he returns to fitness, as will fellow young defender Ayden Heaven, who’s impressed when called upon this season.",
      "Carrick added former centre-backs Jonny Evans and Jonathan Woodgate to his coaching staff when he took on his interim role, and Maguire believes they will both be offer invaluable guidance to the young defenders in the United squad.",
      "“He was a fantastic player. Coaching [here], he’s come in and been refreshing. He brings great energy to the group, to the sessions”, Maguire admitted about Woodgate.",
      "“Obviously, he’s been a centre-back himself, and he’s giving me tips, and he’s definitely going to work a lot with the younger centre-backs, with Leny [Yoro], Ayden [Heaven], and Tyler [Fredricson].",
      "“But, of course, even senior players like myself and Licha [Lisandro Martinez], we can learn from him. He’s brought great ideas, and I’ve been really impressed.”",
      "MORE MANCHESTER UNITED COVERAGE ON F365\n*  Could ‘commentator’s nightmare’ Angel Gomes return to Man Utd through the back door?\n* Man Utd: Neville view on Carrick baffles Owen as Stam picks alternative – ‘I mean what?!’\n* Huge Liverpool, Man Utd transfer boost as Barcelona ‘will listen to offers’ for ‘leader’",
      "On Evans, Maguire added: “Jonny is great to have around. The way that he handles himself and the responsibility that he took on his shoulders when he was a player, he can take that on to coaching as well.",
      "“Just little things like in the session the other day, I was finished and was walking in and could see that Jonny was doing extra work with Leny and Ayden. Things like that, as a young boy coming through and playing on the biggest stage, sometimes you have to learn and adapt on the pitch and on the stage, but you also can’t forget that you need to improve and you need to work.",

      "Man Utd have won four Premier League games on the bounce for the first time since 2024; Michael Carrick has overseen wins against Tottenham, Fulham, Arsenal and Manchester City; he believes the team are now playing with \"expression and excitement\"",
      "Sunday 8 February 2026 07:02, UK",
      "It's four Premier League wins in a row for Manchester United under Michael Carrick and a season that was unraveling just weeks ago now looks full of potential and promise.",
      "A 2-0 victory over Tottenham at Old Trafford extended Carrick's 100 per cent start as head coach and will further strengthen his case to be given the job on a long-term basis. At the very least, his impressive impact surely puts him in the conversation.",
      "Saturday's win also marks the first time in two years that United have won four Premier League games on the spin, with hopes of a top-four finish and a return to the lucrative Champions League now looking more realistic than not.",
      "Carrick was particularly pleased with the purpose of his side, encouraging \"expression and excitement\", as Bryan Mbeumo and Bruno Fernandes scored the goals that extended their unbeaten streak to eight games overall - their longest run since 2022.",
      "\"The first goal is normally vital, to get ahead, but I think it's just encouraging the expression, the attacking play,\" Carrick said.",
      "\"Not so much enjoyment where you can do what you want and it's a playground, kind of flicks and tricks, but more playing with a purpose and confidence.",
      "\"The connection with everyone has been as good as anything. The feeling, the emotion and connection with players, staff and fans - it feels good. We've had to win games in different ways. It gives me a lot of satisfaction to see the stadium this way, to look forward to the excitement.",
      "\"I'm pleased with the buy-in. We're in a good emotional place and that helps you. The four games we've had look different, we've not cracked it. I'm aware of that.",
      "\"We're just moving on to the next one and not settling for what we've got. Not taking things for granted is something we speak about a lot and the boys have been really good for that so far.\"",
      "Carrick has transformed United's fortunes since he was parachuted in to replace Ruben Amorim last month. As well as beating Spurs and Fulham, he has also masterminded wins over the division's top two sides Arsenal and Manchester City.",
      "Captain Fernandes believes Carrick has added 'something special.' He said: \"Carrick came in with the right ideas, giving the players the responsibility and freedom on the pitch.",
      "\"It's very good. I was sure he would be a great manager and he is showing it. We hope we can help him even more.",
      "\"Everyone understands the pressure of playing for this club, everyone knows the expectations around it. He knows what it means for this club to win. It adds something special to the team.\"",
      "Fernandes himself has been at the heart of United's revival. Asked if the midfielder is among the most in-form players in the Premier League currently, Carrick added: \"Listen, it'd take a long time to sum it up [his contribution here].",
      "\"I think he's offered the club so much in the time he's been here, since he walked in the door. He played different roles today for us and ended up on the left. The second goal was from the left as we changed things around a little bit.",
      "\"He's a team player, he gives so much to the group. He's got big moments in him but we know the quality he has. He cares a lot for this football club and the team and that is clear to see.\"",
      "There was plenty of hyperbolic conversation in the press room at Old Trafford on Saturday. The question most were asking: 'Are Manchester United back?'",
      "Not to rain on the parade, but it's perhaps a little too early to declare United as fully reformed. They do, however, look imposing in Carrick's mould, fluid in attack and organised defensively.",
      "He was true to form post-match, calm and controlled in his exchanges with reporters, emphasising that nothing has been achieved yet. Tangibly it hasn't. But for these long-suffering United fans, the gift of four on the bounce will feel like a lottery win. These are heady times given what came before.",
      "Carrick's United have already eclipsed last season's points total with over a third of the season remaining. It's impossible to overstate the underperformance in the 18 months preceding his appointment, but equally important to highlight the impact since. What I like most is the coordination in each attacking phase; so well balanced.",
      "Carrick is also showing impressive maturity and composure in-game. His decision-making is drawing praise. This looks to be the start of something with huge promise - and maybe even longevity.",

      "Manchester United have won four Premier League games in a row for the first time since February 2024 under Erik ten Hag. It's taken two years, but it seems like Michael Carrick has cracked it. He was true to form post-match, calm and controlled in his exchanges with reporters, emphasising that nothing has been achieved yet. He's right, tangibly it hasn't.",

It's impossible to overstate the underperformance in the 18 months preceding his appointment, but equally important to highlight the impact since.",
      "Casemiro is in his best form as a United player. Luke Shaw is also rolling back the years. Diogo Dalot looks transformed. And the decision to leave Kobbie Mainoo out in the cold for so long by the previous regime is looking sillier by the week. Combined, the team have scored 10 goals in four under Carrick, and conceded just four. The improvement across the board is as obvious on the eye as it is measured by results.",
      "Man Utd's decision makers have plenty to ponder if this upturn is here to stay.Laura Hunter",
      "Cristian Romero as captain is a problem for Thomas Frank, despite him not wanting to admit it. Continually, Romero has proved himself to be unreliable and reckless. And now he's surely also beginning to lose some of the respect of his team-mates, sent off for the second time this season at the cost of a four-game suspension. He's the first player to be sent off twice in the Premier League this season.",
      "Some might argue he should not have even started the game at Old Trafford given his midweek rant about the Tottenham squad's \"disgraceful depth\", but Frank backed him. He badly let his manager down. Now he's lost the moral high ground too.",
      "There is something awfully ironic about a player so troubled by Tottenham's lack of options that he took to social media to spell out his gripe publicly, who himself is now unavailable to feature for his team until mid-March. Romero has one red card for every 25 games he has played for the club. Those in glass houses should not throw stones - the defender would be wise to remember that.Laura Hunter",
      "Gabriel Jesus' return from injury has meant one key thing from the perspective of Viktor Gyokeres. He is no longer guaranteed to lead the line for Arsenal.",
      "Given it has been a tough season for the Swede, it may have been easy for him to go into his shell even more. He has been used to averaging a goal a game or better in the last couple of seasons. With 11 goals in 31 appearances for the Gunners, he is well off those levels.",
      "But a noticeable improvement is apparent. The 27-year-old has eight goal involvements in his last eight games. In 2026, he has more goals than any other Premier League player across all competitions.",
      "Yes, some might point to the opposition in some of these. Kairat Almaty should've been brushed aside. Leeds and Sunderland are not easy games, but still ones you'd expect Arsenal to win. But amongst that are also goals and assists against Chelsea and Inter Milan too.",
      "Notably, the goal against Inter was similar to his second against the Black Cats. Gyokeres was able to bear down on goal with the opposition pressing. The finishes were different, but the nature was the same. And he was fresher having come off the bench.",
      "Perhaps that's the key for unlocking the best from Gyokeres towards the back end of the season. With Jesus and Havertz back as options, does Arteta look at Gyokeres as more of an impact player on the bench.",
      "That role would appear to suit his strengths some more. Very rarely do Arsenal play in a way that allows Gyokeres the chance to run in behind and get a march on defenders, since they are usually holding possession in areas high up the pitch.",
      "But, in tight games like against Inter or Sunderland, their resolute defensive structure means they can soak up pressure and then hit teams on the break. With Gyokeres fresh and up top in those moments, there's no player in that Gunners squad they'd rather have leading the charge.",
      "The strength in depth Arteta has at his disposal is going to be crucial from now until the end of the season. Nine goals from the bench is the highest of any Premier League club and proves just how much quality he has. But just as important as that. is how he utilises it.",
      "Would Gyokeres have been dreaming of coming to the Emirates to be a player to come off the bench? Of course not. However, that may be where he is most effective from now up until the season's end.Callum Bishop",
      "Defying expected goals has been a common theme for Aston Villa this season but it looks like their luck is beginning to run out.",
      "Morgan Rogers' well-taken goal was against the run of play and the promise they showed in the early stages of this game quickly faded.",
      "A tally of just 0.44 xG highlights the lack of cutting edge, intent and quality in the final third which plagued this performance.",
      "If it wasn't for Emiliano Martinez and the seven saves he made, Villa would have walked away empty-handed.",
      "A nine-point gap to Arsenal at the top of the table has quickly opened and dreams of competing for the title have shifted to fears over the likes of Chelsea and Manchester United closing in behind them.",
      "They still hold an eight-point gap on Liverpool in sixth but if they continue to play like this, that will reduce and their hopes of securing Champions League football will follow suit.",
      "In both the defeat to Brentford and the draw to Bournemouth, Villa have been dull and uninspiring. Injuries have plagued the squad, but there is no time for excuses; Villa need to find their spark again.Patrick Rowe",
      "One goal, one assist - Rayan's already lighting up the Premier League after just two appearances.",
      "The 19-year-old Brazilian is seen as Antoine Semenyo's long-term replacement after signing for Bournemouth in a £30.3m deal from Vasco da Gama during the January transfer window.",
      "The winger came on to provide an assist in the 2-0 victory at Wolves last weekend and was then handed his first start against Aston Villa, hitting the crossbar with a header in the first half before netting the equaliser in the second.",
      "Rayan's size instantly makes him stand out. He is not as lightweight as his compatriot Estevao at Chelsea and is more of a direct runner like Semenyo. That's how he scored what should be the first of many for Bournemouth, driving past Lucas Digne into the area before finishing.",
      "He will have little issue in adapting to the physicality of the Premier League, winning eight of his 13 duels against Villa and under Andoni Iraola, he can be moulded into the club's next hot property.David Richardson",
      "West Ham love a talisman. A maverick-type individual who doesn't necessarily bend or sway in the same direction of the team but will always deliver.",
      "From Carlos Tevez to Dimitri Payet, an individual who captures the hearts and minds of Hammers is West Ham heritage.",
      "Crysencio Summerville could be another talisman on a long line of individual stars at West Ham as he continues drive West Ham's survival bid.",
      "His fifth straight goal in as many matches at Burnley was a crucial one. For many obvious reasons, as it set the tone for the Hammers' eventual victory.",
      "However, on a personal note, it marks the \"coming of a Hammer\" for Summerville, who hadn't scored all season before his current run.",
      "While his talent has never been questioned since making the move from Leeds in 2024, his consistency due to injury has hindered his overall impact.",
      "There's no time like the present for Summerville to continue to leave his mark, with West Ham in need of someone to guide them into Premier League safety.William Bitibiri",
      "In a season marred by injury and frustration, doubts about Cole Palmer were just starting to creep into mainstream football conversation.",
      "Before Saturday's win at Wolves, Palmer had just four goals this season, with only two Premier League goals from open play since January 2025, and looked a player bereft of confidence in a disappointing substitute appearance against Arsenal in the Carabao Cup in midweek.",
      "How about a hat-trick to silence the doubters?",
      "With this triple, Palmer became the first player in Premier League history to score three hat-tricks in the first half of a match, while his four hat-tricks overall are the most of any Chelsea player in Premier League history.",
      "But it was the manner of his three goals which will mean so much to the Chelsea star. He took his two penalties with his quintessential coolness - and smashing in his hat-trick goal from open play three minutes after his second displayed the confident Palmer Chelsea fans had grown so used to seeing in the last two seasons.",
      "\"In terms of Cole, we know what a world-class player he is,\" said new Chelsea boss Liam Rosenior, who lauded his hat-trick hero throughout his post-match press conference.",
      "\"He's played a lot of football for the last year, not much rest, but when he's at his best, he's unstoppable.\"",
      "With eight wins in their last 10 games, Chelsea are a team on the up - and a fully-fit, confident Palmer will only increase opponents' fears of an already formidable side.Noah Langford",
      "Rob Edwards had seen his side go a whole month without scoring a Premier League goal so perhaps the Wolves boss could be forgiven going with such an attacking line-up for the visit of Chelsea. It was a 4-2-3-1 with Angel Gomes as a deep-lying playmaker.",
      "\"We wanted to be really positive, we wanted to be brave, press higher, and then we wanted to try and have more of an attacking threat on the pitch. Removing a defender and putting a more attacking player on it, simply speaking that was the thinking.\"",
      "He abandoned the plan when 3-0 down inside the first half. The penalties conceded by Matt Doherty and Yerson Mosquera were labelled \"ludicrous mistakes\" by Edwards. His side threatened to capitulate in the minutes that followed before going to a back five.",
      "The issues were as much mental as tactical but it was a chastening reminder for Edwards of the fragility - just one of the reasons why Wolves are rooted to the bottom of the table. Dealing with these battle scars is just part of the challenge he faces now.Adam Bate",
      "The boos that rang around St James' Park were angry and pointed. Newcastle fans expect better than this.",
      "Eddie Howe was keen to accept that - but also provide mitigating circumstances. Five injured players are out in Joelinton, Fabian Schar, Tino Livarmento, Lewis Miley and Anthony Gordon. There is also a hectic fixture list which is not holding up, while simple mistakes are being punished.",
      "The excuses have been there all season for Newcastle. A lack of attacking fluency could go date back to Alexander Isak's transfer saga - that set the club back in their pre-season preparations. Newcastle now don't know who their No 9 is out of Nick Woltemade and Yoane Wissa, perhaps Isak's transfer drama is finally catching up with them.",
      "But there are also circumstances that Howe can control. Newcastle have conceded 15 goals in their last five games - even though defence is an area the club actually strengthened in last summer.",
      "Everything that made Howe's Newcastle hard to beat is drifting away. And that tough fixture list, it's hotting up. Up next are four testing away games in Spurs, Aston Villa, Qarabag and Man City. If Howe can't find a solution to this slump, this could get ugly.Sam Blitz",
      "Everton manager David Moyes was not sure whether to talk up his side's European prospects or play them down after their late come-from-behind win at Fulham, and instead ended up doing both!",
      "\"Hugely important [win] and I think it probably keeps us away from the big R word at the bottom of the league, that's for sure,\" he initially said after the game without a hint of sarcasm, before revealing his true feelings.",
      "\"I don't want to come in here and say we're trying to avoid relegation. I don't want to do that because Everton have had too much bad news and bad publicity, so I'd rather come in here and say we're having a go at Europe.",
      "\"You might laugh at me in a few weeks' time and say, 'How stupid was I', but I'd rather be positive.\"",
      "However, with the Toffees now in a tightly congested pack hot on the tails of sixth-placed Liverpool, Moyes and his players really can dare to dream of a first European appearance for nine seasons and why not, given their impressive form since the Scot returned to manage the club last January.",
      "In fact, Everton rank sixth for points won in that time, so do not be shocked if that is where they finish come May.Richard Morgan",
      "Elland Road. Under the lights. It's a formidable challenge for any Premier League side and the home advantage Leeds garner in these matches was plain to see on a wet, windy and wildly successful night for Daniel Farke's side. They've won all five of their evening kick-offs here this season now.",
      "The playing surface wasn't ideal for either side - Farke suggested it was more suitable for sheep than footballers - but Leeds' high-intensity play, fuelled by the energy of their supporters, left Forest stuck in the mud.",
      "Across the pitch, Leeds players were excellent, from Karl Darlow's saves and James Justin's chance creation to Iliev Gruev's box-to-box excellence and the goal-scoring of Jayden Bogle, Noah Okafor and Dominic Calvert-Lewin.",
      "Their nine-point advantage on the drop zone was trimmed to six by Saturday's win for West Ham but that made this impressive thumping of Forest all the more important. A tricky run of fixtures is coming up but with points on the board and taking the confidence from this display, Farke's side should be optimistic of winning this Premier League survival battle.Peter Smith",

      "Saturday 7 February 2026 19:44, UK",
      "Michael Carrick made it four wins from four as Manchester United landed a confident 2-0 victory over toothless Tottenham, with the visitors' misery compounded by Cristian Romero's second sending off of the season.",
      "The Spurs captain had been defended by Thomas Frank in the week after an outburst on social media criticised the club's \"disgraceful\" lack of depth - Frank labelled the comments \"passionate\" and opted to field him as part of a revamped back four anyway, only for him to see red for a rash challenge on Casemiro in the 29th minute.",
      "Romero has now been sent off six times across all competitions since his Spurs debut in August 2021 - more than any other player in the competition in that period and faces a four-game suspension as a consequence.",
      "The home side's opener arrived nine minutes later via a well-worked set-piece. Bruno Fernandes and Kobbie Mainoo were both involved, allowing Bryan Mbeumo to tuck home his eighth goal of a fruitful campaign. United's coordination in attack was impressive despite the scarcity of more goals, needing a flurry of late chances to finally yield a game-sealing second thanks to Fernandes in the 81st minute.",
      "The same cannot be said of Spurs. Under Frank, Tottenham are winless when trailing at the break and so it proved again, with Romero's dismissal raising more questions over the management of a squad decimated by injuries, but surely better than the 14th place they find themselves in. Even with a full complement of players in the first half they looked blunt.",
      "Carrick's audition for the permanent role at Old Trafford continues to go from strength to strength, cementing their position inside the top four, while Frank's credit is surely waning. Spurs have slumped to their 10th defeat and are only nine points above the Premier League drop zone.",
      "Man Utd: Lammens (7), Dalot (7), Maguire (7), Martinez (7), Shaw (6), Casemiro (7), Mainoo (6), Amad (5), Fernandes (7), Cunha (6), Mbeumo (7).\n\n\nSubs: Sesko (6), Mazraoui (n/a), Ugarte (n/a), Zirkzee (n/a), Fletcher (n/a).\n\n\nTottenham: Vicario (5), Udogie (6), Van de Ven (5), Romero (1), Gray (5), Sarr (6), Palhinha (5), Gallagher (6), Simons (6), Solanke (6), Odobert (4).\n\n\nSubs: Dragusin (6), Souza (5), Kolo Muani (n/a), Bissouma (n/a), Tel (n/a).\n\n\nPlayer of the Match: Bruno Fernandes",
      "\"It's incredible. We have had moments where we were not great but the crowd was still like this. The energy is different because we win, everything looks brighter.\"",
      "On Carrick's impact: \"Carrick came in with the right ideas, giving the players the responsibility and freedom on the pitch.",
      "\"It's very good. I was sure he would be a great manager and he is showing it. We hope we can help him even more.",
      "\"Everyone understands the pressure of playing for this club, everyone knows the expectations around it. He knows what it means for this club to win. It adds something special to the team.\"",

      "\"We started well, good away performance. Very even. Happy with that. The red card changed the momentum. Proud of the players for the 60 minutes, how they showed resilience and stayed in the game, kept fighting. We still created moments.",
      "\"It's very tough to go out and not get enough results, we haven't won enough. There is still a lot to hang a hat on. But form has to back that up, and we have to keep doing the right things. There is no other alternative than to keep going, which we will do.",

      "\"The connection with everyone has been as good as anything. The feeling, the emotion and connection with players, staff and fans - it feels good. We've had to win games in different ways. It gives me a lot of satisfaction to see the stadium this way, to look forward to the excitement.",
      "\"I'm pleased with the buy-in. We're in a good emotional place and that helps you. The four games we've had look different, we've not cracked it. I'm aware of that.\"",

      "Saturday 7 February 2026 17:51, UK",
      "Michael Carrick says Manchester United cannot make a \"knee-jerk\" decision about their long-term future on the back of him winning his first three matches as head coach.",
      "The Red Devils turned to their former midfielder, captain and coach on a deal until the end of the campaign after Ruben Amorim's patchy 14-month reign came to an acrimonious end in early January.",
      "Carrick has rejuvenated United since taking over as head coach three weeks ago, with wins against Manchester City, Arsenal and Fulham propelling the side up to fourth in the Premier League.",
      "Next up is an Old Trafford clash with his former club Tottenham on Saturday. The 44-year-old says he would not get carried away if they won again - and nor does he believe the club would.",
      "\"Nothing's changed, no, to be honest,\" said Carrick - nominated for January's Premier League Manager of the Month award.",
      "\"It's not going to change what I do, or how I feel about it. I think I'm fully aware of the role I'm doing here and the responsibility I've got.",
      "\"We want to be successful. I want the club to be successful beyond the end of the season. If that's me, if that's somebody else at this stage, I can't control that and we'll see what happens.",
      "\"But it's certainly about trying to improve the team and keep making Manchester United stronger and improving all the time. But nothing's changed. The results over a short period of time don't change that.",
      "\"If they have changed that, there's something wrong. It can't be so knee-jerk either way, whether it's really good or whether there are a few issues we need to solve. It's steady progress, really.",
      "\"You know that football can twist and turn just as quick, so we have got to keep it a bit level, really, and keep focusing on what we need to do.\"",
      "Carrick was chosen to take charge for the remainder of the season after United also spoke to former boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer.",
      "The Red Devils decided to bring in a coach with an understanding of the club to smooth the transition into a short-term role, allowing director of football Jason Wilcox time to undergo a thorough recruitment process.",
      "Put to Carrick that he will surely be happy to be part of that conversation if his success continues, the head coach said: \"I'm loving what I'm doing. I'm here, you know.",
      "\"I feel at home here but I fully understand the situation, so I'm not getting too carried away.\"",
      "Carrick's only focus right now is United's upcoming matches, with Saturday's match against Tottenham followed by facing another of his former clubs on Tuesday - West Ham, away.",
      "\"What he needs - and it probably wouldn't help him - is to win five or six on the trot, then lose three or four on the trot, and then how do you respond?",
      "\"People will say he should never be Man Utd coach. But when you lose those three or four games and the scrutiny comes on you at the biggest club in the world, how are you going to cope?",
      "\"We saw it with Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, he came in, was at the wheel - but then you see pictures of him at Watford away when they got destroyed and he looked lost.",
      "\"Carrick probably needs to lose three or four on the trot, then win five on the trot and everybody will go: that's a good manager. He's turned it around when the pressure was on. That's the only way you're ever going to know how good he is.\"",

      "Man Utd won't U-turn on the decision to allow Casemiro to leave when his contract expires in June despite improved Premier League form under Michael Carrick; the club are forward planning and expected to chase a number of midfield targets in the summer, with Elliot Anderson top of list",
      "Monday 2 February 2026 15:50, UK",
      "Manchester United midfielder Casemiro is in his richest vein of form since arriving at Old Trafford in a deal worth £70m in 2022. So why would the club let him go now?",
      "The veteran Brazil international, who turns 34 later this month, rolled back the years as Man Utd picked up another dramatic win over Fulham on Sunday, heading in the opener before setting up Matheus Cunha's goal with a sublime no-look pass.",
      "Casemiro has started all three games under Carrick, but made his impending departure official last month while Ruben Amorim was still in charge. United did hold the option to trigger a 12-month extension, but with a midfield overhaul planned for the summer it was decided that Casemiro would be allowed to leave.",
      "\"Manchester United are determined not to have a short-term approach to signings and managers. That's what has got them into trouble in the past. It's left a lot of big-name players on big wages who are not part of the plans.",
      "\"Casemiro is flying right now. Player of the match against Fulham. I can understand why a lot of fans are saying: 'we're trying to find a midfielder but willing to let Casemiro go?'",
      "\"He turns 34 later this month, he's one of the biggest earners at the club, £325k a week, and Man Utd know that can't go on forever. He's playing out of his skin right now but they have to have a longer-term plan.",
      "\"Casemiro will leave in the summer, they have done the big goodbye video and there is no going back on that.\"",
      "\"I think it is. He has done brilliantly well, playing with Kobbie Mainoo and Bruno Fernandes in there makes a difference.",
      "\"He's got to move on. He's 34 and before you know it, he's 35. He's been a top player; he's had a lot of unworthy stick because he hasn't got the legs to play on his own in midfield if Fernandes pushes forward.",
      "\"Mainoo has helped that a lot - common sense by Michael Carrick. But we're talking about the future of Man Utd and they are right to be doing what they're doing and letting him go.\"",
      "\"Midfield is where Man Utd feel they will focus the bulk of their spend in the summer.",
      "\"Carlos Baleba at Brighton is on their list, Elliot Anderson at Nottingham Forest, they like Adam Wharton, and Joao Gomes at Wolves so there's a number of options. They may even do two.",
      "\"Window by window, they are prioritising areas of the team. It's a very data-led approach. Last summer the priority was to score more goals so that's why they pumped £280m into three forward players.",
      "\"Now they are wanting to solve the next imbalance and are going to address midfield. I get the impression Anderson is top of the list but we're talking over £100m.\"",
      "The logic here is obvious. Casemiro is an aging midfielder, whose stamina has been questioned repeatedly over the past 18 months. Perhaps some of the blame lies at the door of previous manager Ruben Amorim, as it was clear to most that Casemiro no longer had the legs to be the heart of the engine room. The rebalance with Kobbie Mainoo has proved invaluable.",
      "Clearly, he's still got plenty to offer Man Utd between now and the end of the season, though. Maybe beyond. But time is against him and a recalibration of the wage bill is necessary if the club want to chase top targets in the summer.",
      "Nevertheless, Casemiro's worth can still be underlined by his numbers. He's scored as many goals as Fernandes (five) in the Premier League this season - also equal to Benjamin Sesko. His aerial ability makes him a huge threat from set-pieces, with four of those goals headers.",
      "Defensively he's made the most tackles (52) of any Man Utd player and recovered the second-most possessions in midfield (51), behind Fernandes. His duels won (107) can only be bettered by Patrick Dorgu. And his quality on the ball is undeniable.",
      "This latest upturn will ensure he gets a big send-off in May. But before then, he's proving a highly resourceful and reliable asset for Carrick to call upon.",

      "Tuesday 3 February 2026 08:47, UK",
      "Going into the window, the feeling was Arsenal were going to be quiet. And so it proved.",
      "They did their business in the summer - and were only likely to dip into the market if a long-term target or unique market opportunity presented itself.",
      "Manager Mikel Arteta maintained they would be alive and alert.",
      "However, he also called for the numbers in a matchday squad to be increased in line with Europe. He is begging for 23 in total - and 20 outfield players. The reason? He is having to disappoint two or three players every game.",
      "With that in mind, the chance of a new signing was always going to be slim.",
      "A serious injury to Mikel Merino gave Arsenal food for thought - and they tentatively explored a potential deal. However, that's as far as it got and Arsenal will continue their fight on all four fronts with the squad they have.",
      "Thoughts will no doubt switch to the summer when Arsenal are expected to be busy again.",
      "With the challenges presented by complying with the Premier League and UEFA's financial rules still very pertinent for Aston Villa they perhaps did as much as they could this January to remain competitive on three fronts in the coming months.",
      "Douglas Luiz has a lot of work to do to cover for the absence of injured trio John McGinn, Boubacar Kamara and Youri Tielemans for the foreseeable future, but at least he knows Unai Emery's system.",
      "Tammy Abraham knows the club and is a more natural central striker than Donyel Malen, who left to join Roma. Returning from Rome is Leon Bailey who feels a better option than Evan Guessand, who underwhelmed after his summer arrival.",
      "Emery's brilliance probably holds the key to Villa holding off the challenge from behind in the league and ending a 30-year wait for silverware.",
      "This was always going to be a tough transfer window for Bournemouth to navigate with the anticipated departure of Antoine Semenyo due to his release clause. However, with the arrival of four new faces for Andoni Iraola, this window will be seen as a success.",
      "The injury to Justin Kluivert around the same time as Semenyo left for Man City only added to the sense that this would be a pivotal period for the Cherries. Results were mixed and the club were flirting with slipping into the relegation battle. It all felt a bit worrying.",
      "How different the picture looks now though. Unbeaten in five games and 13 points clear of the bottom three, Bournemouth can comfortably look up the table rather than over their shoulder and the early signs are that their latest recruits could be hits.",
      "Brazilian teenager Rayan, the potential Semenyo replacement, set up Bournemouth's second goal in Saturday's 2-0 win at Wolves in his debut following £30.3m move from Vasco da Gama. Bournemouth will be glad he has a release clause of £86.3m in his contract.",
      "The signing of midfielder Alex Toth from Ferencvaros was another coup. Lazio, Benfica and Galatasary were all chasing the 20-year-old, who was developed at the Hungarian club by head coach Robbie Keane, and he comes with experience of pressure environments.",
      "Bournemouth have also brought in goalkeeper Christos Mandas from Lazio to provide competition for Djordje Petrovic in a move that could become permanent in the summer. Left back Ade Solanke, 18, is seen as one for the future after signing from Lorient.",
      "There was hope at one point of adding a fifth signing. Inter's Luis Henrique was one of those that Bournemouth looked at but because of the club being in such a comfortable position there was no desire to force a move at an inflated price late in the window.",
      "Brentford's impressive form this season meant they could stay measured in this window. Their league position is a reflection of the great work they have done in previous windows.",
      "They had wanted to add a young centre-forward prospect for some time and Kaye Furo becomes that player, now learning under former Club Brugge team-mate Igor Thiago.",
      "They also kept hold of some key players in Kristoffer Ajer and Vitaly Janelt. Both have signed new deals after uncertainty around their futures and interest from other clubs.",
      "There may have been some further changes in defence but nothing really materalised for Ethan Pinnock in the end, meaning no replacement was needed.",
      "It started with a bang but arguably ended with a bit of a whimper.",
      "Brighton's window started in spectacular fashion with the return of club legend Pascal Gross early on. The re-signing of the Germany international for a fee of £1.2m from Borussia Dortmund is already starting to pay dividends. His experience will be key and is sure to rub off on the many young players in the squad.",
      "Matt O'Riley is another player to return to the club albeit in different circumstances. The midfielder's loan from Marseille was ended early and becomes another option for head coach Fabian Hurzeler. With appearances in the Champions League for the French club this season, the former Celtic man comes back a better player.",
      "The 25-year-old's return to Brighton was confirmed on the final day of the window. Perhaps there was a hope amongst some of the support in certain quarters that there would be more arrivals.",
      "Should a striker have come in to ease the pressure on 35-year-old Danny Welbeck and 18-year-old Charalampos Kostoulas up front? Evan Ferguson's possible return from a loan spell at Roma was often a topic of discussion but he is staying in Italy.",
      "Has Tommy Watson's loan move to Millwall for the rest of the season left Brighton light in terms of back-up wingers? Brajan Gruda has moved to Leipzig on loan too.",
      "Brighton tend not to do too much business in January - they are calm, not reactive and spend much of it looking at forward planning. Much work would have been done behind the scenes for the summer window. Expect a fair bit of movement in and out then.",
      "Worth a reminder that one of their best signings this window might not be a player but one behind the scenes. Mike Anthony, who was high performance chief at the All Blacks, came in to take a newly created role as the club's head of player development and high performance in what they feel is an innovative move focused on culture and mentality.",
      "Signing James Ward-Prowse, a player with a proven track record in the Premier League, from a relegation rival no less, will certainly be seen as a smart signing by Scott Parker.",
      "Whether that will be enough to surmount the overwhelming challenge Burnley face in terms of keeping themselves in the Premier League remains to be seen.",
      "At one stage, it looked as if Ward-Prowse's move from West Ham would not happen. At least they managed to get this one over the line.",
      "Whatever Burnley did in this window, they were always facing an unenviable task to stay in the Premier League.",
      "Chelsea are usually big spenders in transfer windows but this turned out to be a quiet month by Stamford Bridge standards.",
      "They missed out on their No. 1 target Jeremy Jacquet. Liverpool got him at the last minute after Chelsea were confident that he would choose them ahead of other interested clubs.",
      "It's debatable whether Chelsea needed another centre back, especially with Levi Colwill due back from injury before the end of the season and promising young defenders out on loan.",
      "One of them - Mamadou Sarr - is coming back from sister club Strasbourg and he is expected to challenge for a first-team place straightaway.",
      "This window officially marked the end of Chelsea's so-called Bomb Squad. Raheem Sterling's contract was terminated and Axel Disasi joined West Ham on loan.",
      "It's been some start to the year for Crystal Palace.",
      "They smashed their transfer record to sign Brennan Johnson from Spurs. Their FA Cup defence collapsed at the first attempt against non-League Macclesfield Town. Days later, their manager Oliver Glasner confirmed he'd be heading off in the summer just moments after revealing that club captain Marc Guehi was set to be sold.",
      "On the pitch, the winless run continued as a season filled with promise began to unravel. Reinforcements were forthcoming as the future of their top scorer Jean-Philippe Mateta became more and more uncertain. Long-term target Evann Guessand was signed in a try-before-you-buy loan deal from Aston Villa as Palace threatened to commit more than £100m in incomings in the winter window.",
      "As ever, all roads pointed towards a busy Deadline Day. Jorgen Strand Larsen was lined up as a replacement for Mateta. But the wantaway Frenchmen didn't get the Italian Job done.",
      "It seemed implausible that Palace would end the season with two frontline strikers but they deserve credit for ploughing ahead with the deal for Strand Larsen despite the late collapse of Mateta's move to Milan.",
      "It's a calculated gamble from Steve Parish. They have added firepower up front. They have failed to replace their captain but left no stone unturned in their attempt to sign a central defender for a fair market price.",
      "It's now imperative Palace immediately quell any doubts surrounding their Premier League status and then press forward in achieving a successful finish. A rollercoaster season could still culminate in European glory.",
      "David Moyes had been pretty clear in his expectations that this window and Deadline Day was not going to be spectacular.",
      "Only a few weeks ago he said to me how welcome an approach it is given the spending of the past which caused Everton so much harm in the long run.",
      "So, a quiet window ended with what should be seen as sensible business.",
      "In Tyrique George they are getting the chance to have a look at a 19 year old who joins on loan until the end of the season, before deciding whether or not to take up their option to buy.",
      "There was interest in George from another premier league club and one in Europe, who was close to a £22m move to Fulham in the summer. And he arrives at Everton having scored three goals in 11 Chelsea appearances this season, including in the Champions League at home to Ajax.",
      "In total he's made 37 appearances for Chelsea including one Premier league start. While his only Premier League goal came last season as he kick started the comeback win at Fulham.",
      "Given the injury to Jack Grealish, George will be hopeful David Moyes can offer him greater playing time.",
      "The Everton boss will have also Dwight McNeil to call on for the remainder of the season out wide after his move to Crystal Palace collpased after the deadline had passed. A deal sheet was submitted but the relevant paperwork was not done in time.",
      "At the obligation price of £20m it was a difficult offer for Everton to say no to. But having another more experienced wide player to support youngsters George and Tyler Dibling could prove valuable for Moyes.",
      "Deadline Day at Fulham started with a great deal of promise but ultimately failed to deliver. The club were hopeful they could get a deal done for Riccardo Pepi, the PSV Eindhoven striker.",
      "The club had reached an agreement on a £32m package, but that was on the proviso that PSV could find a replacement. They were unable to do so and therefore the deal fell through.",
      "Fulham do however still hope to pick it back up in the summer. The 21-year-old Pepi is a long-term target and a long-term successor to Raul Jimenez.",
      "Harry Wilson was also in the headlines early on Deadline Day. It emerged Everton had made an approach for him last week - unsurprisingly it was rejected by Fulham. Marco Silva has repeatedly said Wilson is going nowhere in this window.",
      "So, Fulham's January business saw a 30-year-old winger, Adame Traore, leave the club and a 22-year-old winger, Oscar Bobb, arrive.",
      "Slim business, yes - but if Bobb can stay fit and fulfill his potential you have to say potentially very good business too.",
      "Leeds United reach the end of another transfer window with an overwhelming sense of what could have been after missing out on Jorgen Strand Larsen to Crystal Palace.",
      "This was never supposed to be a big window for Daniel Farke's side and loan signings were always thought to be more likely than permanent deals. That is how things panned out in the end with Facundo Buonanotte, a loan from Brighton, the only incoming for Leeds.",
      "The Argentina international playmaker adds a creative profile to the squad that was lacking, but it remains to be seen if he can cut it at Premier League level after struggling to consistently keep his place in the team at Brighton and Leicester.",
      "Expectations were low coming into the window, but the pursuit of Strand Larsen raised hopes. Leeds were unwilling to go above £40m - Wolves' initial valuation for the striker - and Palace ended up committing to £8m more than that.",
      "For a club that said they were maxing out PSR after the summer, there was no further that Leeds could stretch to make this deal happen. So why did some of those funds not go towards improving other areas of the squad?",
      "Leeds were planning to structure most of the deal to come out of next year's budget to stay within Premier League rules. Strand Larsen was also viewed as a unique opportunity and players like that do not often become available in mid-season windows.",
      "At a time when there is uncertainty in the goalkeeping department and injuries at full-back, it has been received by some fans as a gamble not to invest more in the squad to give Leeds the best chance of Premier League survival.",
      "We have been here before, though, with Leeds. In the summer, deals for the likes of Igor Paixao failed to materialise, and there were concerns that this squad did not have what it takes to cope with the Premier League. So far, they have defied those expectations.",
      "The true test will be in May. If Leeds stay up, none of this matters, but if they go down then perhaps the club will look back on this window as a missed opportunity to strengthen. Only time will tell.",
      "After a record breaking spend in the summer, this was a window in which Liverpool were never going to go wild. At the same time, having missed out on Marc Guehi on the final day of the summer window when Crystal Palace pulled the plug, to then lose him to Manchester City was a major blow.",
      "Ultimately the whole package didn't make financial sense, which was disappointing given how open to the move Guehi had been in the summer and the fact that Liverpool's interest had never waned, particularly as they saw him as someone who is not only one of the Premier League's centre backs but can also cover at right back.",
      "Liverpool's need for defensive reinforcements was emphasised by injuries to Joe Gomez, Jeremie Frimpong and Conor Bradley all adding to the long term absence of Geovanni Leoni.",
      "Ultimately, a deal for Lutsharel Geertruida proved impossible as Sunderland were not in a position to sanction the move despite the player himself wanting to make the switch.",
      "It all meant that discussions with Spurs over a £5m move for Andy Robertson were short-lived as it would have made little sense for Liverpool to weaken their defensive options further. Similarly, Inter Milan's interest in Curtis Jones was swiftly rebuffed.",
      "Liverpool, though, have started the reshaping of their backline. Jeremy Jacquet completed a medical before finalising a deal that could see Liverpool pay Rennes up to £60m for the 20-year-old centre half. However, he will only become a Liverpool player in the summer, and will play out the rest of the season with Rennes hoping to deliver European football.",
      "Unlike the Guehi situation, Liverpool have headed off interest from other clubs, most notably Chelsea, with Jacquet believing he'll get more game time at Anfield. For the rest of this season though, it's a case of as you were when it comes to the makeup of this current Liverpool squad.",
      "Manchester City arguably stole the show this window by swooping in ahead of Liverpool and other top clubs for Antione Semenyo and Marc Guehi.",
      "They have made two important additions ahead of the summer in key positions and signed Premier League ready players who have already hit the ground running.",
      "A solution has also been found, finally, for Kalvin Phillips who joins Sheffield United on loan until the summer.",
      "Sverre Nypan returns from a loan at Middlesbrough to integrate into the first-team, while a number of other youngsters head out on loan for more game time.",
      "As expected, it was overall a quiet window in the January transfer window for Manchester United.",
      "Entering the window, there was uncertainty amongst a few players such as the likes of Kobbie Mainoo, Manuel Ugarte and Joshua Zirkzee.",
      "But none of those situations for different reasons ended up in departures - and perhaps the reason why is because the biggest outgoing of the window for the club was United's former head coach Ruben Amorim and the most impactful incoming was his replacement Michael Carrick after leading them to three huge wins in the last three weeks.",
      "The change has seen United start Kobbie Mainoo start and star three league games in a row which has put questions around his future on hold for now.",
      "However with no reinforcements, all attention for United will be on the summer window as they look to reshape their midfield, especially with Casemiro leaving the club at the end of his contract this summer as well.",
      "They resisted the temptation to reinforce this window and refused to compromise on their long-term targets but all eyes will be on United's hierarchy this summer - especially when it is still uncertain who will be the head coach going into next season.",
      "Newcastle failed to make a January signing, much to the frustration of their fanbase.",
      "With a relentless fixture schedule that sees them currently play a game every three days, a fresh face would have given everyone a lift. Eddie Howe has previously gone on record to say he'd like to sign at least one new player every window.",
      "In truth though, Newcastle are still counting the cost of a summer splurge that saw them spend £250m. The jury is still out on a few of those new faces as Eddie Howe attempts to knit a new team together without the player they were all there to serve - Alexander Isak. It all feels very much a work in progress.",
      "The biggest move of Deadline Day was club captain Jamaal Lascelles moving to Leicester City after 12 long years with the club.",
      "The team as a whole are doing okay despite the distractions and residual damage of last summer, and are still in four competitions.",
      "But when it comes to new faces they'll keep their powder dry until the summer as they look to strengthen significantly then.",
      "It won't all go their way, as it again looks as though they'll have to brace themselves for further attempts from competitors to sign their best players. Sandro Tonali and Tino Livramento are two that continually get linked with moves away.",
      "But for now, it's batten down the hatches and get through until the end of the season.",
      "Nottingham Forest had a frustrating end to the window but covered most positions they wanted filling.",
      "There will be lots of focus on their failed bids for Arne Engels and Jean-Phillippe Mateta but both would have been bonus signings.",
      "Luca Netz was brought in for a pittance by Premier League standards to offer competition at left-back, Lorenzo Lucca offers another striking threat with Chris Wood out and Stefan Ortega's arrival was timely after an injury to 'keeper Matz Sels.",
      "Long-term targets will be chased in the summer but Elliot Anderson's future will be the main story at the City Ground at the end of the season.",
      "It was a significantly quieter transfer window for Sunderland than what we saw in the summer when 14 new arrivals cost around £150m.",
      "That was a necessity back then, but the need for mass change has been reduced due to Sunderland's impressive start to the season that sees them unbeaten at home and lying mid-table.",
      "The one big signing arrived on Deadline Day - Nilson Angulo from Anderlecht. The winger has signed for £15m, with a potential £2.5m in addition in add-ons.",
      "It was left very late, and reliant on outcast Adil Aouchiche freeing up a loan spot by cutting his deal at Aberdeen short and moving to Schalke. That loan spot was the taken by Simon Adingra who joined Monaco on loan, and allowed Sunderland to sign Angulo permanently.",
      "Confused? It's never dull on Deadline Day. Sporting director Florent Ghisolfi can be very creative.",
      "Liverpool tried to make it more confusing by attempting to sign Lutsharel Geertruida over the weekend. But due to the complexity of the deal (The Dutchman is on a season-long loan from RB Leipzig) Sunderland refused to sanction it.",
      "There were a number of January departures from The Stadium of Light. The most notable one being former captain Dan Neil, who led the club promotion to the Premier League. He was never given a chance by Regis Le Bris in the top flight, but now has the chance for back-to-back promotions with Ipswich",
      "Tottenham end the window with Thomas Frank's squad looking short amid an injury crisis despite the arrivals of midfielder Conor Gallagher and left-back Souza. Failure to bring in a forward after injuries to Richarlison and Mohammed Kudus is the big shortcoming for Spurs.",
      "The club did not want to be reactive to their situation and panic buy. January is a notoriously hard window to do business in and top players rarely become available. Every effort was put into trying to sign Antoine Semenyo, but he chose to join Manchester City.",
      "Spurs also tried to sign Andy Robertson to inject some much-needed experience into the side and provide cover for the injured Ben Davies. However, it proved too difficult for Liverpool to recall Kostas Tsimikas from his loan at Roma and the deal could not be done.",
      "Randal Kolo Muani, Mathys Tel, Radu Dragusin and Antonin Kinsky all attracted interest in this window but Spurs could not sanction their exits with all their injury issues. They have all struggled for game time this season but there is an opportunity now to prove themselves.",
      "Spurs have big plans to strengthen in the summer transfer window. Frank will hope he gets the time to reap the benefits of that. The spirited fight-back in the draw against Man City suggests he has the backing of the players, but a lot is being asked of this depleted group.",
      "Frank and his employers must hope that they have enough to rise to the occasion and restore some consistency for Spurs. Otherwise, the increasingly frustrated fanbase may run out of patience with the lack of support they have been given.",
      "West Ham made a fast start to the transfer window and a slow-ish end.",
      "Taty Castellanos and Pablo coming in within five days of January strengthened the attack. Adama Traore coming in towards the end adds pace and unpredictability into the squad.",
      "Nuno Espírito Santo constantly talked about rebalancing the squad during the winter window. I can't quite work out if he has so I'll be interested to get his answer when I speak to him on Thursday. Apart from Lucas Paqueta, no key players have left. And the Lucas Paqueta we've seen this season can't be described as key.",
      "Players who weren't playing minutes are gone. Igor Julio, James Ward-Prowse, Guido Rodriguez and Andy Irving are out. Axel Disasi signing on the final day offers needed cover.",
      "Are West Ham stronger now than compared to the start of the window? I would say just. Pablo and Castellanos as a pair seems to be working up front but if that starts to slow down, the window starts to look very different.",
      "Wolves' window has been more about outgoings than incomings, as the club looks increasingly likely to be relegated at the end of the season.",
      "They have sold arguably their best forward in Jorgen Strand Larsen to Crystal Palace for £48m, which has to be seen as trying to extract maximum value for a player out of form.",
      "In turn the club have been looking to get ready for a medium term that may involve a season at least in the Championship, and the additions of Adam Armstrong and Angel Gomes add know-how and quality.",
      "It is a shame they did not also add Che Adams - a long-term target - to their thanks despite trying with Torino right until the final day.",
      "Tough times ahead for Wolves indeed but the money from Strand Larsen gives them more to spend in the summer and with time to plan for the market.",
