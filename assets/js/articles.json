      "Ruben Neves will join Real Madrid on a free transfer in a blow to Manchester United's hopes, according to former Al Hilal player Al Jaber. The Red Devils were eyeing Neves' dwindling contract as a potential opportunity.",
      "Neves, 28, would cost in the region of £20million to sign from Al Hilal with his deal set to expire in little over six months. The former Wolves star could bring significant wage demands after commanding £350,000-a-week in Saudi Arabia, however.",
      "Signing a central midfielder is a priority for United, who have been linked with a number of players including Carlos Baleba, Conor Gallagher, Adam Wharton and Elliot Anderson. It appears Neves could prove elusive, with Los Blancos open to securing a low-risk, high-reward deal.",
      "Jaber, who also spent time at Molineux in 2000, claimed on MBC that Neves is set to leave for free and will join the Spanish giants. “I fear Neves will move from Al Hilal to Real Madrid for free after his contract expires at the end of this season,\" he said.",
      "\"There are English Premier League clubs that want to sign Neves, offering three-year contracts – until he is 31. There is Real Madrid, and I’m sure there are other clubs interested in Neves.”",
      "The news will come as a blow after it emerged that Bournemouth winger Antoine Semenyo is set to choose Manchester City over Old Trafford. The Cherries ace is keen to head to the Etihad and is available £65m in the summer.",
      "Ruben Amorim met with Semenyo in the summer, but United's attempts appear to have failed. The Portuguese coach has been coy over the club's January plans but only wants players who will impact United in the long term.",
      "\"We'll see,\" Amorim said when asked if money was available for the transfer window. \"The only thing we know is that we only would try to bring players that we think are going to be the future.",
      "\"It's not going to be to save something in this moment, to cope with the losses of three players for AFCON. \"It’s not going to be like that, even if we try to bring one player, maybe it's not the position that we need more.",
      "\"We will try to bring now – and in the end of the season – players that are perfect for our future. I don't know what is going to happen, but it's possible that we can do something.\"",

      "The 25-year-old signed a new deal with the Cherries in July, helping to fend off interest from a host of clubs during the summer window. However, part of that arrangement included a clause which will allow Semenyo to leave for £65million at the start of 2026.",
      "A host of clubs have been in the mix to sign the Ghana international, including both Manchester United and City. However, the Athletic report that Semenyo's preference would be to play for Pep Guardiola in the blue half of the city.",
      "United had made a hard play to sign the standout Cherries star, but there was always an acceptance a deal would be hard. And a desire to immediately compete for the game's top prizes is said to have played a deciding factor in his final choice.",
      "Liverpool are also understood to be admirers of the players, while Chelsea made tentative enquiries for a player who already has eight Premier League goals this season.",
      "Guardiola had previously hinted that City could be set for a quieter January window, after green lighting a huge spending spree 12 months ago. That was in the midst of a crippling injury crisis, while City are in a much stronger position this time around.",
      "He said: “Listen, last season what happened in the transfer window was for just one reason – we have (had) no players. Old players and no players, old players and no players. And you have to, you know, for the next years, new vibes, new energy – that was the reason why. But I’m not a big, big, big, big fan for the (January) transfer window.",
      "“Always you have to be open, you never know what happens, and it’s possible that the club decides it’s good for now and for the next three, four, five, six years – why not? But it’s better to, you know, at the end of the season to see what happened this season, how it was. It’s much better.”",
      "Bournemouth have been resigned to the fact that they could lose their star player, who they signed from Bristol City for around £10m in 2023. Speaking on Tuesday, manager Andoni Iraola said he was desperate to keep Semenyo, but couldn't 'control' what would happen when the window opens on January 1.",
      "\"Antoine Semenyo right now is with us, he's playing very well, he's playing very well,” the Spaniard said. “I understand that there is a lot of noise around Antoine, but my concern is that it doesn't affect him, his performances, and we are seeing that it's not affecting his performances.",
      "\"He's very committed to the team and I hope we can keep him there. There are situations that I cannot control or we cannot control, but right now Antoine is our player and he's going to continue playing for us. If you ask me, I don't want to lose him, definitely I don't want to lose him.",
      "\"But like we always say, every time the market opens, you never know what's going to happen. I think it's no secret that he's a massive player for us.\"",
      "He added: \"At the end of situations, myself as a coach, I don't control, I'm not in the negotiations when the players negotiate with the club and they find agreements.",
      "\"When you sign a contract, both parties are happy when you sign the contract. But me as a coach, I can only tell you I hope we don't lose him, because it's very, very important for us. But I don't know, I cannot control what's going to happen.\"",

The Bournemouth forward has been a revelation in the Premier League this season, with his once erratic shooting in the final third now a thing of the past.",
      "Semenyo's tally of eight goals and three assists from 16 appearances has sparked a flurry of interest in clubs securing his services. Arsenal, Manchester United, Liverpool, Tottenham and Manchester City have all been strongly linked, but it appears only three clubs are still in contention.",
      "Yet it seems that might have been a slip of the tongue, as Semenyo, who has been spotted at the Emirates Stadium, once explicitly stated that he supports Arsenal. In a 2024 interview with The Athletic, he said: \"I am an Arsenal fan.",
      "\"I don't conflict the two with my job. It is great to play against Arsenal, a team I have watched all my life and I want to play for the top clubs as well. In order for that to happen I need to prove it.\"",
      "When quizzed about whether joining the Gunners would be his dream, Semenyo responded: \"Yeah, any team that plays Champions League, Europa (League) - that's the aim. I know that's not going to come with a click of my fingers, it's going to take some time.",
      "\"It's going to take goals. It's going to take a lot of consistent performances. But I've worked all my life for that and I'm just going to continue working hard. That's my mentality.\"",

      "Alan Shearer says Bruno Fernandes' injury will undoubtedly prove costly for Manchester United in the coming weeks. The midfielder sustained a hamstring problem during United's 2-1 defeat to Aston Villa in the Premier League at the weekend.",
      "Since joining the club, Fernandes has been an indispensable figure for United, with his remarkable availability being one of his greatest strengths. The Portugal international has been absent for just two fixtures due to injury since his arrival at Old Trafford in 2020 and it was reported on Tuesday he could miss the next six matches.",
      "United face a hectic schedule over the festive period with four games in 12 days. United host Newcastle on Boxing Day before welcoming Wolves to Old Trafford four days later. Trips to Leeds United and Burnley then follow in 2026.",
      "Ruben Amorim is already managing without several crucial players who are away competing at the Africa Cup of Nations, including Bryan Mbeumo, Amad Diallo and Noussair Mazraoui, who are all representing their nations. United are also without Kobbie Mainoo, Harry Maguire and Matthijs de Ligt through injury, but Shearer has highlighted why Fernandes' absence in particular will prove damaging for the team.",
      "\"Losing Bruno Fernandes at any time would be bad but losing him when you're already missing three players in Mazraoui, Diallo, and Mbeumo, will hurt Man United,\" Shearer told Betfair. \"He's been the one constant through all their troubles, the one pulling them through games at times.",
      "\"There's no doubt they'll miss him massively. He very rarely gets injured, so he'll be a big miss.",
      "\"Performance-wise, I thought Man United did alright against Villa, but the result was decided by Morgan Rogers. With injuries and people away, Newcastle are the same.",
      "\"They have massive injuries defensively, but Lewis Miley was brilliant at right-back. He was one of the best players on the park. Both teams are struggling because of injury situations.\"",
      "As Shearer rightly points out, a staggering 14 players could be unavailable for United's clash against Newcastle United. Following the weekend's defeat to Villa, Amorim revealed that he anticipates Fernandes will be unavailable for that clash, though he declined to specify an exact timeframe for his return.",
      "\"It's a soft tissue, I think he's [Fernandes] going to lose some games, I don't know for sure. Let's see,\" Amorim said.",

      "Chelsea have emerged as contenders to sign Antoine Semenyo by launching a late bid to sign the Bournemouth star. Semenyo, 25, is wanted by a cluster of Premier League clubs including Manchester United, Manchester City, Liverpool and Tottenham.",
      "The London-born Ghana international is available for £65million due to a release clause which activates on New Year's Day. The clause will only be active until the second week of January, though, giving Bournemouth ample time to sign a replacement.",
      "A departure next month looks increasingly likely, although Chelsea weren't among the favourites to sign him - until now. Several outlets are reporting that the Blues entered the race on Monday evening after Semenyo and his representatives had spent the day weighing up their options.",
      "The Mail report that Semenyo has an affiliation with Chelsea, having been born in West London. The 25-year-old came through the ranks of Bristol City before joining Bournemouth for £10m two years ago.",
      "Semenyo's release clause, which is specified as £60m plus £5m in add-ons, will be reduced in the summer transfer window, but interested clubs are increasingly wary that by then it could be too late. The forward has scored eight goals and provided three assists in 17 games for Bournemouth this season.",
      "The Cherries are reluctant to lose Semenyo, especially having lost four key players over the summer, but they're ultimately powerless if a suitor activates his clause. Speaking on Tuesday afternoon, Bournemouth manager Andoni Iraola commented: \"Semenyo right now is with us. He trained today with us",
      "\"I know that there is lots of noise around him. Not my concern, my concern is it doesn't affect his performances. It is not doing, he is very committed to the team and I hope we can keep him here.",

      "\"Antoine, for me, has been performing very well. Not just the last two games where he has scored. He has consistently been very good since the beginning. Even when not scoring, he is still valuable for us. At the end, we don’t just demand numbers. It is no secret he is a massive player for us.\"",
      "Iraola can understand why so many clubs are interested, adding: \"Yes, he is performing amazingly well. But lots of wingers from other teams are performing amazingly well.",

      "Since arriving at the Catalan club, Rashford has been given substantial playing time. Hansi Flick has put his faith in the 28-year-old on the left wing whilst Raphinha has been sidelined and he's also been used as a striker. Rashford has netted seven goals and contributed 11 assists across all competitions this season.",
      "Whilst his opportunities on the pitch might diminish now that Brazilian star Raphinha has returned from injury, Rashford has demonstrated his worth as a key part of Flick's squad. However, Lescott, who previously worked alongside Rashford with England, isn't taken aback by the United forward's displays.",

      "Ex-Manchester City defender Lescott even confessed that when rumours emerged about Rashford's potential departure from United, he was eager for his former club to snap up the England international.",
      "\"When there was speculation, and it wasn't a lot, about him maybe coming to Manchester City, I would've wanted to sign him that day. I would've signed him,\" Lescott revealed.",
      "\"I doubt he would've gone, but he definitely would've made City better. You look at what he's doing at Barcelona. They have Raphinha. And Raphinha was sensational last year and they haven't got any worse when Rashford is in there. He's obviously a top top player.\"",
      "Rashford was relegated to the substitutes' bench during Barcelona's most recent victory at Villarreal, but manager Flick has already made clear precisely what the 28-year-old brings to the side.",
      "\"I try to speak to every player when they are not selected. The last time I checked with him he said, 'Boss, you don't have to tell me about your decisions. The most important thing is the team. We have to win the three points. The rest is not that important,'\" Flick explained.",
      "\"This is the perfect mentality. I am so happy to have him. When he is on the bench, he shows that we have a good and deep squad. What I can say is that he is an absolutely professional player. In the beginning, he had to adapt a little bit, but now he is at his best level.\"",

      "Antonio Conte had a dig at Manchester United after two ex-Old Trafford stars helped Napoli emulate Diego Maradona and win the Italian Supercoppa. The former Chelsea and Spurs boss led the southern giant to the Scudetto in his first season in 2024/25 with Romelu Lukuku top scorer.",
      "And now Scott McTominay and Rasmus Hojlund - who was loaned after the Belgian suffered a thigh injury in pre-season - have starred in the 2-0 win over Bologna in Saudi Arabia. The Scotland star was named Serie A player of the year after netting 13 goals from midfield after his £25.7million sale by United in August 2024.",
      "And Hojlund, who cost the Old Trafford club £72m, has now scored seven times back in Italy as Napoli won the Scudetto and the Supercoppa in the same year for the first time since 1990 with Maradona. The Dane posted a picture of himself with the trophy on social media with the caption: \"What a great decision looks like.\"",
      "And Conte said: “Everyone used to say Rasmus didn’t play in Manchester, neither did McTominay, so why? Ask yourselves some questions there. The staff and I had work to do, there is a reason we are here, after all.”",
      "Ex-Premier League stars Kevin De Bruyne, Andre Frank Zambo Anguissa and Billy Gilmour were all out injured as Brazilian David Neres scored both goals in Saudi Arabia. And Conte added: “The first goal was a moment of magic from an individual, but the other chances were all prepared by analysing how to cause problems for Bologna.",
      "“Our job as a coach is to increase the knowledge of a player and make him stronger. I feel like everyone I worked with emerged improved, in tactical understanding and movements, but also in mentality.”",
      "Conte, who won the Premier League and FA Cup at Chelsea, lifted his 10th major trophy - and then admitted he was motivated by his past failures. “I can tell you that nobody bothers looking up the beaten finalists, because I’ve lost many as a player and a coach and they made me more mean,” said the former Italy head coach.",
      "“Nobody remembers I was runner-up in the World Cup, European Championship finalist, or lost three Champions League Finals. They remember that as a player I won one Champions League and one Intercontinental Cup.",
      "“When you lose a final, it increases your determination, and you try not to experience those ugly moments again. They hurt because you know that it was a good journey, but you’ve got to put that cherry on top of the cake.”",
      "President Aurelio de Laurentiis said: “Not since the Maradona era have we won two trophies in a year. Conte is a master.”",
      "This latest triumph comes only six weeks after Napoli lost 2-0 at Bologna in Serie A and Conte launched a stinging attack on his player before missing training. “We must do something,” he said. “I don’t want to accompany a dead man”.",
      "But they go into 2026 sitting third in Serie A, although they are down in 23rd in the Champions League.",
      "Former England manager Fabio Capello told Gazzetta dello Sport: “Let’s not joke. What crisis? Napoli has excellent players and a winning coach in Conte, now Lukaku and other injured players are back.",

At the time, it seemed inconceivable that the forward, who had risen through United's youth ranks to become his boyhood club's star player, would ever depart Old Trafford, especially under such bitter circumstances while still at his physical peak.",

This came after 18 months of underwhelming performances from a player who had previously been his team's driving force.",
      "Amorim's public criticism of the striker seemed to be the breaking point for Rashford, prompting him to take the drastic decision to end his United ordeal - through a bombshell interview with journalist Henry Winter where he announced his willingness to embrace a \"new challenge.\"",

      "Rashford also responded to Amorim's decision to drop him by stating: \"It's disheartening to be left out of a derby but it's happened, we won the game so let's move on.",
      "\"It's disappointing but I'm also someone as I've got older I can deal with setbacks. What am I going to do about it? Sit there and cry about it. Or do my best the next time I'm available.\"",
      "By that point, it seemed all bridges between Rashford and Amorim had been burnt, with the forward excluded from every matchday squad for the remainder of the month until December 30, 2024, when he remained on the bench as an unused substitute against Newcastle.",
      "Having not played a single minute since December 12, Amorim, in late January, publicly addressed Rashford’s need to change aspects of his game if he had any hope of returning to the squad, saying he would rather pick his 63-year-old goalkeeping coach ahead of a \"player who doesn’t give maximum effort in training\".",
      "Rashford left United for the first time at the end of the January transfer window, securing a loan move to Aston Villa until the end of the season. His stint at Villa Park allowed him to rebuild his reputation and regain visibility after his exile, especially in the Champions League against PSG.",
      "He netted four goals and provided six assists in 940 minutes of play but his loan spell ended on a sour note due to a hamstring injury, after which he returned to Carrington. There, he was part of Amorim's five-man 'bomb squad', who were sidelined from first-team training to encourage them to seek transfers.",
      "After biding his time for the right opportunity, Rashford secured his dream move to Barcelona in July, joining the La Liga champions on loan until the summer of 2026. In the five months since, Rashford has come close to recapturing his best form, contributing 11 assists and seven goals for the Catalans in 24 appearances.",
      "The Englishman has made it clear he doesn't envision a return to United, expressing his wish to sign for Barcelona once his loan ends. For now, it remains uncertain whether Barcelona will activate their reported £26million option-to-buy clause, though the unlikelihood of any reconciliation with Amorim suggests Rashford will permanently leave United regardless.",

The January transfer window is fast approaching, and with it has seen increased speculation about the business that Premier League clubs may conduct.",
      "United are reportedly expected to have a busy transfer window in the New Year, with the midfield widely talked about as an area of the squad in need of investment. Brighton's Carlos Baleba was heavily linked with a move to Old Trafford during the summer transfer window, with the Seagulls reportedly placing a valuation of more than £100million on the midfielder.",
      "Elliot Anderson of Nottingham Forest and Adam Wharton of Crystal Palace are two other players who have been linked with United over the last few months. The Sun have reported that United are prepared to sign two midfielders ahead of the summer transfer window.",
      "It remains to be seen, though, if those plans will involve looking to bring in midfield reinforcements in the January window. A separate report from The Times has also reported that, with the recent injury to Bruno Fernandes, it's now unlikely that Mainoo will leave United in the January window.",
      "Mainoo has been heavily linked with a move away from United over the last few months, with the 20-year-old apparently looking for more game time after spending much of this season on the bench. Ruben Amorim has yet to hand Mainoo a start for United this season in the Premier League, but has given the England international 11 appearances as a substitute in the top flight.",
      "United suffered a 2-1 defeat to Aston Villa in the Premier League on Sunday, where Mainoo was not available for the match due to a calf injury. Amorim stated after the defeat to Villa that he expects Fernandes to be unavailable for United for their next run of fixtures after the Red Devils captain suffered a hamstring injury over the weekend.",

The Scotland international featured for the entire 90 minutes as Antonio Conte's Italian champions earned a well-deserved 2-0 victory over Bologna in the Supercoppa Italiana.",
      "Napoli's Brazilian winger David Neres stole the headlines, netting both goals either side of the break. Yet, McTominay's display was befitting of the Serie A Footballer of the Year award he claimed for last season following his dominant league performances, having been central to several of Napoli's brightest moments once again.",
      "The 29-year-old threaded a sublime pass to Eljif Elmas in the opening stages which sent the Macedonian clean through, though he was denied an assist as his team-mate fired wide of the target.",
      "He came close to finding the net himself just before the break to extend Napoli's advantage but was thwarted by opposing keeper Federico Ravaglia. McTominay continued to dominate the midfield through his commanding presence and physical prowess, while proving instrumental in the team's attacking phases.",
      "He was again denied in the 77th minute following an acrobatic effort at the far post, having played a crucial role in Neres’ second goal minutes prior after pressing Bologna’s goalkeeper.",
      "Unsurprisingly, he received plenty of praise in the Italian press, with Corriere della Sera giving him a 7/10 match rating and referring to his \"dynamism\".",
      "Corriere dello Sport also awarded him a 7/10, noting that he was \"less flashy than usual in the first half but no less present.\" They highlighted how despite Tomasso Pobega's attempts to contain him, the Scottish international easily won their duel in the first half and upped his game after half-time.",
      "La Repubblica gave him a match rating of 6.5, framing his performance as a Scottish showdown with fellow countryman Lewis Ferguson in midfield - a battle they believe McTominay came out on top of.",
      "Eurosport Italy lauded McTominay, describing his performance alongside Rasmus Hojlund's as \"excellent\". Football Italia and Sky Sport Italy also deemed his display worthy of a 7.",
      "Il Giornale were slightly less generous, giving him a 6.5, but agreed that he continued to provide a constant threat, writing: “McTominay wasn’t as brilliant as in other matches but still always finds ways to be dangerous.”",
      "It appears the former United man’s form is showing no signs of letting up under the tutelage of Conte, having scored five goals and provided three assists this season across all competitions.",

Hojlund managed just four goals for United last term and found himself slipping down the pecking order following Ruben Amorim's attacking restructure.",

Both Dorgu and Obi also left comments congratulating the striker.",
      "Following the match, Conte reflected on his team's performance and joined Hojlund in taking a dig at United. \"If we look at how many chances we created, we could have been far more effective,\" he commented.",

      "Manchester United star Kobbie Mainoo has simply not done enough to warrant a starting spot this season, according to former Premier League midfielder Dan Gosling. The 20-year-old has seen his hopes of a World Cup call-up fade after falling out of favour under Ruben Amorim, leading to suggestions he might need to leave Old Trafford in January.",
      "Mainoo has played a little over 200 minutes in the Premier League this season, with Amorim seemingly believing he doesn't have the qualities to play in a double pivot in his 3-4-2-1 system. The academy graduate's only start this term came in the Carabao Cup, where he played the full 90 minutes in a shock defeat to Grimsby Town.",
      "\"He's obviously not doing enough on the training pitch because Ruben Amorim isn't not picking him because of his personality or other personnel. He's not doing enough on the training pitch to deserve his place. It's simple as that. If you're not working as hard as you can day in and day out you're not going to play. Yes, there's competition for [Bruno] Fernandes. But there's other spots.",
      "\"There's Casemiro's spot. He was out of the spot and he's knuckled down, his performances have gotten better. His physique has gotten better. I still don't think he's the answer and Mainoo can compete with him. He can also play higher up. He's obviously not doing enough on a day-to-day basis to convince Ruben Amorim.\"",
      "Mainoo looked like he might get a chance to impress on Sunday after playing half an hour in the 4-4 draw with Bournemouth a few days earlier. Casemiro's suspension meant there was a vacancy in the middle of the park, but Mainoo picked up an injury in training and missed the game.",
      "That meant Manuel Ugarte partnered Fernandes in the middle, but the Uruguayan didn't cover himself in glory in a 2-1 defeat to Aston Villa. Furthermore, Fernandes only managed 45 minutes due to injury and will be assessed before United play Newcastle on Boxing Day.",
      "Napoli are among the clubs linked with Mainoo, with an injury to summer signing Kevin De Bruyne leaving them in need of midfield reinforcements. However, United were unlikely to sanction an early January move even before Fernandes' injury.",
      "United are not expected to sanction any exits before their three players involved at the Africa Cup of Nations return to club duty.

      "Bournemouth star Antoine Semenyo could decide on his next club as soon as today, it has been claimed. The Ghana international is one of the Premier League's most in-demand players, with a release clause making a January move away from the Vitality Stadium a strong possibility.",
      "The Cherries will allow potential suitors to speak to their top scorer if they receive a £65million bid, but only if that bid arrives by January 10. The agreement, entered into when Semenyo signed a new deal over the summer, is thought to be designed to give Andoni Iraola's team time to find a replacement.",
      "Manchester United and Manchester City are among the clubs to have been linked with the former Bristol City star, who has eight goals and three assists in the Premier League this season. Arsenal and Tottenham were also mentioned as potential destinations over the summer, but the Gunners' moves for Ebere Eze and Noni Madueke mean they look less likely to break the bank.",
      "Liverpool were also linked over the summer, opting instead to move for other targets. Among them was Alexander Isak, and an injury to the Reds' record buy could prompt them to return for Semenyo in January.",
      "Semenyo scored again over the weekend, though it wasn't enough for victory against Burnley. The goal was his second in as many matches after scoring his team's first in their 4-4 draw away to Manchester United.",
      "After the Burnley game, Bournemouth boss Iraola was asked about interest in Semenyo. \"He is a massive player for us. It is not a big secret,\" he said.",
      "Over the weekend, it was reported that Manchester United were ready to go 'all out' to land Semenyo. The Red Devils added around £200m worth of attacking talent in the summer, though one of those new additions - Cameroon forward Bryan Mbeumo - is currently away at the Africa Cup of Nations.",
      "United boss Ruben Amorim met Semenyo earlier in the year, and there have been suggestions he sees the Cherries star as someone who can operate as a wing-back after successfully moving winger Amad into a similar role.",
      "\"The only thing we know is that we only would try to bring players that we think are going to be the future,\" Amorim said when asked about new additions in January. \"It's not going to be to save something in this moment, to cope with the losses of three players for AFCON. It’s not going to be like that, even if we try to bring one player, maybe it's not the position that we need more.",
      "\"We will try to bring now – and in the end of the season – players that are perfect for our future. I don't know what is going to happen, but it's possible that we can do something.\"",

      "Lisandro Martinez is ready to step up and continue in midfield after filling in for the injured Bruno Fernandes against Aston Villa. Martinez was summoned from the bench to play in the centre of the pitch at Villa Park and could be drafted into the same role against Newcastle on Boxing Day.",
      "Manchester United’s captain was forced off at half-time of their 2-1 defeat by Villa on Sunday in the Premier League and is facing a spell on the sidelines. Ruben Amorim has just three fit first-team midfielders for the upcoming visit of Newcastle to Old Trafford: Casemiro, Manuel Ugarte and Mason Mount.",
      "The United manager handed debuts to academy graduates Jack Fletcher and Shea Lacey on Sunday, but it was Martinez who he turned to at half-time. The Argentina international defender only recently returned from 11 months on the sidelines with an ACL injury and acquitted himself well at Villa.",
      "While Martinez is primarily a centre-back, he spent three years at Ajax where positional flexibility is coached and has filled in at left-back and midfield during his time at United, with his selfless attitude coming to the fore. “We have many good midfielders. Like I have said in many interviews, I will play wherever the coach wants to use me,” he said back in March 2023 when Erik ten Hag was short of options.",
      "Playing Martinez in midfield was raised back in November and Amorim’s response suggested he is not particularly keen on the idea. “I can't say,” he said when asked about the possibility. “I think a smart, intelligent football player can play in a lot of positions, but it is not the right position for him.",
      "“He needs more time to work there as he is not working there [currently]. But in one emergency he can play [there]. I am not thinking about that.”",
      "Casemiro will return from suspension for the Newcastle game, but Kobbie Mainoo will miss the game after injury struck at the worst possible time for the 20-year-old, who has been frustrated sitting on the bench all season.",
      "“I will see what we’re going to do,” Amorim said on Sunday. “I think Kobbie Mainoo is out and Bruno is out. So we will see. We are going to find solutions. No excuses. We need to win the next game and we will try to win the next game.”",
      "Matthijs de Ligt and Harry Maguire are also on the sidelines with injuries, while Amad, Bryan Mbeumo and Noussair Mazraoui are away playing at the Africa Cup of Nations. The combination has left Amorim extremely short of options, especially considering his low opinion of the level of academy players.",
      "Nevertheless, the United boss has confirmed he won’t turn to the January transfer window to solve the crisis. “What we cannot do is to reach January and try to do everything in urgency and make mistakes and then [it’s] ‘here we go again’ with a lot of mistakes,” Amorim said. “I’m not going to get [together] with [club chiefs] Jason [Wilcox] and Omar [Berrada] and say: ‘We need a lot of players.’ Because we have a plan.",
      "“If we have to suffer, the club comes first. Of course, we are in a moment where we need points but we need to find solutions and we are going to continue with our plan. You can feel in this moment that we are going to struggle, but we will see. We have to deal with it.”",

      "Gary Neville has tipped Lisandro Martinez to be an 'emergency replacement' for Bruno Fernandes at Manchester United. Since his transfer from Sporting Lisbon in 2020, the 31-year-old has been a constant presence for the Reds.",
      "However, it seems manager Ruben Amorim will have to manage without him for a while, following the United captain's hamstring injury during the first half of the 2-1 defeat to Aston Villa. Remarkably, over a five-year period, Fernandes has only missed two matches due to injury.",
      "With Kobbie Mainoo sidelined with a calf injury before the match at Villa Park and Casemiro suspended, Amorim had to think outside the box by fielding central defender Martinez alongside Manuel Ugarte. After the Argentine's impressive performance in midfield, Neville believes he could be a viable option in that position.",
      "On the Gary Neville podcast, the ex-United skipper said: \"At half-time, maybe I was thrown by the fact when Bruno Fernandes initially pulled up with his hamstring, he sent Joshua Zirkzee out to warm up. I thought, 'Yeah, that's right, because he can drop in.'",
      "\"I also liked the idea of having Mason Mount and Zirkzee behind Sesko, and Zirkzee and Sesko being potential threats from crosses, you've got running into the box, with Mount maybe dropping deeper and playing alongside Ugarte.",
      "\"When I saw Martinez come on, I thought 'How are United going to get a goal? How are they really going to pose a threat?' Now they didn't really pose a threat until that one chance Cunha got, which was a massive chance by the way.",
      "\"I would have liked to have seen Mount and Zirkzee off Sesko with Cunha floating in and around them. He didn't go for it, but I think Martinez, when he came on in the holding position, Villa did not put any real pressure on him.",
      "\"I thought he was good on the ball, I thought he was tidy. He did a good job in there. Maybe that's something that will have to happen.",
      "\"Although Casemiro will be back soon as well, so I don't think we will see him in there too much. But it's potentially one thing Amorim could do in an emergency if it happens over the Christmas period.\"",
      "Fernandes and Mainoo are both expected to miss the Boxing Day match against Newcastle United. Mainoo picked up a calf injury during training ahead of the Villa encounter.",
      "Casemiro will return from suspension, but the out-of-form Ugarte is the only other available central midfielder for the game against Eddie Howe's side. Nevertheless, Amorim made it clear Fernandes' injury will not change United's approach in the January transfer window.",
      "Speaking after the match, Amorim said: \"What we cannot do is to reach January and try to do everything in urgency and make mistakes. And then here we go again with a lot of mistakes. I'm not going to get with Jason under Omar and I'm going to say we need a lot of players because we have a plan.",
      "\"If we have to suffer, the club comes first. Of course, we are in the moment that we need points, but we need to find solutions and we are going to continue with our plan. Of course, you can feel that in this moment we are going to struggle, but we'll see.\"",

      "Manchester United and Ruben Amorim are facing the prospect of entering 2026 without star player Bruno Fernandes, who suffered a muscle injury in Sunday's Premier League loss to Aston Villa. Fernandes sustained the injury towards the end of the first half at Villa Park and was substituted at half-time.",
      "Reports suggest that the United skipper could be sidelined for at least a month. \"I think it's a soft-tissue injury so it's going to be a while,\" Amorim revealed after the match.",
      "\"He is a guy who is always fit so we hope he can recover well. We will see. It's an injury and sometimes it's bad luck or something else at the same time. You can never control these things.",
      "\"We will need to find solutions and we cannot use anything as an excuse. We need to prepare all the guys that we have for the next game. No one is going to remember these problems, so let's cope with that. It will make us stronger.\"",
      "The timing of Fernandes' injury is unfortunate, coming just days before the January transfer window opens, and calls for a new midfielder to be signed as a priority at Old Trafford are likely to intensify. However, Amorim has insisted that the club must avoid making any errors in the upcoming transfer window.",
      "\"We need to deal with that. What we cannot do is reach January and try to do everything with urgency and make mistakes again and be left saying 'here we go again',\" he stated.",
      "\"I am not going to go to Jason [Wilcox] and say we need a lot of players. If we have to suffer, the club comes first. Of course, we are in the moment that we need points, but we are going to continue with our plan. In this moment, you may feel we are going to struggle, but we will see.\"",
      "The impact of Fernandes' injury on United's transfer plans remains uncertain. With doubts surrounding Kobbie Mainoo and Casemiro, a new midfielder was already high on their agenda, but the Fernandes problem has made the situation more urgent.",
      "Fortunately, United have the chance to replace the 31-year-old in the short term and address their midfield issues early in the transfer window. Ruben Neves is a name that has been consistently mentioned as a potential target for United, dating back to his time at Wolves.",
      "Now plying his trade at Al-Hilal, the 28-year-old is being linked with a return to the Premier League after turning down a new contract in Saudi Arabia. The Times has reported that Al-Hilal are resigned to losing him on a free transfer in the summer and are now open to selling him in January in an attempt to recoup some of the £47million they paid for him in 2023.",
      "A price tag of £18m has been suggested, but it's thought that clubs showing interest could secure the Portuguese star for significantly less, potentially offering United a bargain deal for the start of 2026. During his stint at Wolves, Neves made a name for himself as a reliable Premier League midfielder, renowned for his spectacular long-range goals.",
      "United's pursuit of players like Adam Wharton and Carlos Baleba, who carry price tags nearing £100m, means that more affordable alternatives will need to be explored this transfer window. Neves, potentially available for as little as £10m, could be the ideal first January signing.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Ruben Amorim has already offered an explanation after appearing to upset Joshua Zirkzee during Manchester United's 2-1 loss to Aston Villa. The Dutchman came off the bench in the defeat but perhaps expected to be introduced earlier than he was.",
      "United found themselves trailing on the stroke of half-time during their trip to Villa Park after Morgan Rogers' sublime curling effort. Matheus Cunha levelled prior to the break, but Rogers added a second just before the hour mark and secured all three points for Unai Emery's side.",
      "A casualty of the loss was captain Bruno Fernandes, who suffered what appeared to be a hamstring injury during the first half but continued playing. Zirkzee was a frontrunner to replace him at the interval but United icon Gary Neville was \"surprised\" to see Lisandro Martinez come on in his place.",
      "Neville stated that Zirkzee looked upset at not being brought on at half-time, despite being introduced after 73 minutes, but Amorim provided an applicable explanation for a similar decision last season.",
      "\"I'm surprised as I thought Zirkzee would come on as he is closer to Fernandes' position,\" he said before adding: \"He [Zirkzee] doesn't look like he's too happy.\"",
      "But a not dissimilar situation occurred last campaign. Zirkzee started a tie against Newcastle in December 2024 but with United trailing 2-0 after 32 minutes, he was brought off the pitch and looked visibly distraught.",
      "Amorim explained after the match: \"You have to think about the team. The player is suffering during the game. We needed another midfielder. It was tough on me to do that. I talked with Joshua about that.",
      "\"I'm always thinking about the team. At that moment it was important for him to come out. I know that Josh is a really good guy. When he went to the tunnel, I can understand that some guys can be in a bad way but he is a really good lad.\"",
      "He added: \"It is life, and we will support Josh and continue. Newcastle were better than Manchester United. They weren't better than Josh.\"",
      "Neville also had his say during this controversial substitution, much like he did when Zirkzee was not introduced against Villa. He said: \"I know that he's earning a lot of money but there's a human being in there that's basically being cheered off by his home fans and that is brutal.\"",
      "Despite Amorim making decisions surrounding Zirkzee for the good of the team, the Dutchman continues to be linked with a move away from the club.",
      "Zirkzee was only signed in July 2024 from Bologna for £36.5million, but reports suggest he could make a swift return to Italy. Corriere dello Sport claim Roma are interested in Zirkee and the only thing currently preventing a transfer is a disparity on fees.",

      "How do you solve a problem like Bruno? In a week when Manchester United had to consider the possibility of losing their best player after his unexpected comments about his future, they are about to get a taste of what life without Fernandes might actually be like.",
      "The 31-year-old reckons United's powerbrokers wanted to sell him last summer but lacked the \"courage\" to go through with it. His performances this season have once again made him indispensable, but after picking up a hamstring injury at Aston Villa, he now faces a spell on the sidelines.",
      "What are the patterns they can take from those four defeats? These are the games and what sticks out from a Fernandes-less United.",
      "Fernandes wasn't really missing back in May. He was at the Gtech Community Stadium, but spent the whole game sat on the bench. It summed up how United's focus had turned away from the Premier League and towards the Europa League.",
      "Amorim's selection shows how priorities had changed and maybe this game belongs in a category of its own. There were starts for Tyler Fredricson, Harry Amass and Chido Obi. United added gloss to the scoreline but were 4-1 down with eight minutes to go. Mason Mount, Alejandro Garnacho and Amad got the goals and only one of that trio will be available on Boxing Day.",
      "With Fernandes absent, it was Kobbie Mainoo who played next to Manuel Ugarte, another option that is off the table against Newcastle. Amad came on at half-time and he and Garnacho provided some spark to the attack, but that won't be possible now.",
      "Maybe the most relevant game of them all, given Newcastle will be the first opponents United confront without Fernandes. The captain was suspended after being sent off against Wolves, and this was a grim day nobody wants to remember.",
      "Newcastle were 2-0 up inside 20 minutes and it felt like they declared after that. Joshua Zirkzee was hooked after 33 minutes and booed off. Casemiro was given such a run around that it felt like it might be the end for him at Old Trafford.",
      "United mustered just one shot on target as they lost for the fourth game in a row. \"It is a really difficult moment, one of the more difficult moments in the history of Manchester United and we have to address it with honesty,\" Amorim said after the game.",
      "On this occasion, it was Casemiro and Christian Eriksen in midfield, but the ageing duo were run ragged by Sandro Tonali, Joelinton and Bruno Guimaraes. That trio will be licking their lips at the chance to inflict more damage on the United midfield.",
      "The second of two successive games that Fernandes missed with a knee injury. This time, United managed two shots on target and were comfortably held at bay by an Arsenal side still pushing for the title.",
      "United went into the game with a midfield trio of Sofyan Amrabat, Mainoo and Scott McTominay, while Erik ten Hag finally handed a chance to Amad. That is at least something to emerge from the wreckage of the defeats without Fernandes.",
      "There was a lack of creativity on show and with injuries forcing Ten Hag to field Jonny Evans and Casemiro together in the centre of defence, United did well to keep the score down to one.",
      "That was a marked improvement from what happened at Selhurst Park six days earlier. This was a defeat that should have sounded the death knell for the Ten Hag era.",
      "United were ripped to shreds in South London, when Palace had four goals by the 66th minute and could have easily had more. It remains one of the worst nights in the post-Sir Alex Ferguson era, which is saying something.",
      "Palace racked up 10 shots on target to a pitiful two for United, who played with no intensity or imagination. A midfield of Mainoo, Eriksen and Mount might look good on paper, but they were trampled all over.",
      "Ten Hag insisted after the game that \"I will keep fighting\" and somehow United beat Manchester City in the FA Cup final a few weeks later. Thankfully, Fernandes was fit for that one.",
      "Four games without Fernandes and four defeats. Three of them without scoring, and two of them scoring highly on the embarrassment scale. It doesn't bode well.",
      "United managed 10 shots on target in those four games, but half of those were in the chaotic game at Brentford, which had a significant end-of-season vibe.",
      "Across those four games, United created an expected goals (xG) tally of 3.2, of which around half came at Brentford. Fernandes might be playing a deeper role, but he is still miles clear when it comes to creating chances and in his absence, it's pretty clear that there will be fewer opportunities, which is going to put a premium on taking them.",

      "It's going to be a strange experience for Bruno Fernandes on Boxing Day when he sits down to watch Manchester United and is unable to influence the action. Whether Fernandes has his hamstring wrapped up in the warm at home, or has his big coat on at Old Trafford, he isn't going to know what to do with himself when his teammates take on Newcastle United.",
      "Fernandes is 31 and a veteran of 683 appearances for club and country, but astonishingly, he has missed only four games in his career through injury. Two of those were for Portugal in the March 2019 international break and then two for United in May 2024. He has missed two more games due to illness, in 2017 and 2022, and that is it.",
      "It's a remarkable injury record, but one that was unlikely to last as age caught up with the durable Portugal international. The sight of him clutching his hamstring just before half-time at Villa Park on Sunday confirmed Ruben Amorim's worst fears.",
      "Amorim will offer an update on Fernandes' fitness when he holds his pre-Newcastle press conference on Christmas Eve, but he is expected to be absent for around a month. Amorim might also offer a few clues as to how he might replace his captain, although he is arguably irreplaceable.",
      "Fernandes has again been the beating heart of this team this season. Playing slightly ahead of Casemiro, he has 12 goal involvements in 17 Premier League games and set the tone for performances, as he often does.",
      "Amorim has two issues now. How to replace Fernandes in the team and who to hand the captain's armband to. Let's start with the first problem.",
      "In truth, there aren't a lot of options. Kobbie Mainoo will be frustrated that a calf problem has denied him the chance to earn a first start of the season. Amorim has said all season that the 20-year-old is competing for a place with Fernandes, but now he finds himself sitting next to him in the physio's room.",
      "That only leaves Casemiro and Manuel Ugarte. The former will return to the team after serving a suspension on Sunday and perhaps the Uruguayan will keep his place. That would likely mean Casemiro being given the freedom to get forward in the way that Fernandes does.",
      "Amorim ruled out Lisandro Martinez as a regular midfield option last month, but the Argentine looked good there at Villa Park. He is only going to play the holding role, however, and is currently competing with Ugarte for that position.",
      "If Amorim wants a more progressive option, he could turn to 18-year-old Jack Fletcher, who came on for the final 17 minutes on Sunday, or drop Mason Mount back from his position as one of the No. 10s. That would mean Joshua Zirkzee coming in alongside Matheus Cunha. The knock-on effect is that United would have no senior attacking options on the bench.",
      "Amorim will also have to decide who to hand the captain's armband to. It was Diogo Dalot who took it for the second half at Villa and he described that as \"a very proud moment\".",
      "The only game Fernandes hasn't started this season was the Carabao Cup defeat to Grimsby, when Harry Maguire was skipper, but Maguire is now absent with a thigh problem. In the Premier League, the last time Fernandes didn't start was at Brentford in May, when Luke Shaw was captain. Maguire and Diogo Dalot were also missing that day as focus turned to the Europa League.",
      "At Wolves, a couple of weeks earlier, it was the now departed Victor Lindelof who captained United. The only other time Fernandes didn't start in the league last season was against Newcastle nearly a year ago, when Lisandro Martinez wore the armband. That's four different captains in four Premier League games without Fernandes in 2024/25.",
      "The fact that Dalot was captain while Shaw and Martinez were on the pitch would suggest he is now ahead of them. He is in the six-man leadership group named in the summer, alongside Fernandes, Tom Heaton, Noussair Mazraoui, Martinez and Maguire. Of that six, Dalot is the only guaranteed starter on Boxing Day and the only other player from that group who could feature is Martinez.",
      "Casemiro was suspended against Aston Villa but has some leadership experience. He has captained Brazil on 18 occasions, although never skippered Real Madrid. He has worn the armband twice from the off against United, in a 4-0 Premier League defeat to Crystal Palace and a 3-0 Carabao Cup loss to Newcastle.",
      "So everything points to Dalot getting the captaincy in Fernandes' absence. Who replaces him in midfield might be a little trickier.",

      "Welcome along to our latest Manchester United question and answer session with senior club writer Tyrone Marshall, who covers the daily goings-on at Old Trafford.",
      "It's been another busy week in M16. A 4-4 draw with Bournemouth last week, a 2-1 defeat to Aston Villa on Sunday, speculation around the future of Kobbie Mainoo and an injury for Bruno Fernandes, not to mention attempts to sign Antoine Semenyo.",
      "We asked for questions and you delivered. The responses to those submitted are below. We will be running weekly question and answer sessions from now, so keep an eye on our social media feeds and get your questions in as we seek to keep you plugged in to everything going on at Old Trafford.",
      "Appreciating that we don't want to completely undermine the summer budget, how feasible is it that we could trigger Semenyo's release clause and still look at a loan-with-an-option deal for someone like Conor Gallagher?",
      "From a budget point of view, I think that would be doable. The question is whether they want someone like Conor Gallagher. The noise coming out of United is that they will only move for long-term targets next month, which essentially means bringing forward a deal for someone they had lined up in the summer.",
      "Semenyo ticks that box. They looked at him earlier this year, remained interested and would have waited until next summer but for the fact that his release clause meant there was suddenly a queue for him. I believe his release clause might be smaller in the summer, but nobody can afford to wait now.",
      "I don't see United being able to get the calibre of midfielder they want in the summer on loan this winter. Someone like Gallagher or Ruben Neves might tick a box as a short-term, emergency option, but even Ruben Amorim said on Sunday they were keen to avoid making mistakes and would rather suffer short-term pain than make a transfer mistake.",
      "When will the manager give more of the young players a chance instead of buying expensive flops?",
      "To be fair to Amorim, he has given young players a go. As he pointed out, Toby Collyer, Harry Amass and Chido Obi got chances last season. I don't think any of them could say they have been harshly treated.",
      "Collyer has had injury issues since, and Amass is doing well at a struggling Sheffield Wednesday. He will come on for the experience but I don't think anyone thinks he's ready for first-team football at Old Trafford. Chido struggled to influence first-team games last term and isn't exactly knocking the door down now.",
      "There are question marks over how many players at academy level are ready to step up and I don't think Amorim is alone in having doubts. United have made costly mistakes in the market in recent years, but under Amorim, their record looks to have improved.",
      "Senne Lammens looks like a solid signing and Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha look like very good deals. Benjamin Sesko has had a slow start, but there have been flashes of quality.",
      "Fans always want to see young players, especially when a team is struggling, but I don't think the answer lies in youth at the moment.",
      "When was the last time United made a profit from selling a player they had bought? They always seem to take heavy losses when selling \" flops\".",
      "I think the clue is in the question. If you are selling a flop, you aren't going to make a profit on him. It goes without saying that a player's value will have shrunk if they have been a disappointment since signing.",
      "I often think the discourse around United's ability to sell players is a little overplayed. They could certainly get better at it, but Manchester United aren't a selling club. There are usually only two reasons for United to sell, A) that player isn't good enough for the club, or B) they want to move elsewhere (such as Cristiano Ronaldo).",
      "It isn't always that clear-cut, of course, but let's look at a couple of recent departures. Antony and Aaron Wan-Bissaka were poor signings who were never likely to live up to their price tag. That is a failure of recruitment rather than selling.",
      "Aside from academy graduates, one of the last players United made a profit on was Daniel James, but that was always a weird deal. He was never likely to make the grade, improved a little and was 'flipped' for a profit. That is what you expect of Brighton or Brentford, not Manchester United.",
      "Manchester United should not go for a defensive midfielder in this January transfer window. But if we can get the Antoine Semenyo deal done, then it will be considered a good window.",
      "I think if United finish this window with just Semenyo, then it will be a good month. There is fierce competition for his signature but he would follow the trend of Cunha and Mbeumo as Premier League-proven players ready to 'plug and play' under Amorim, even if he ends up playing left wing-back.",
      "There is a concern at the lack of options in midfield and it feels like all four midfielders have question marks over their futures beyond the summer, but United are determined not to panic. They are planning a midfield rebuild in 2026 and it might have to wait until the summer, when we can expect similar sums to the £200m+ spent on forwards in 2025 to be splashed on midfielders.",
      "Did United receive any compensation from the FA for Luke Shaw being injured for months after ridiculously playing for England at the Euros?",
      "FIFA's Club Protection Programme covers the salary of anyone injured on international duty. They must be out for a period of at least 28 consecutive days and the scheme is capped at €7.5million.",
      "However, Luke Shaw was not injured on international duty in 2024. You could argue he rushed back to play for England, having missed the last three months of the season for United, but which professional footballer wouldn't want to play in a major tournament final for their country?",
      "It's worth remembering that Shaw played the full 90 minutes in England's Euro 2024 final against Spain. He played 42 minutes against Switzerland in the quarter-finals and 45 minutes against the Netherlands in the semi-final. He returned to pre-season training at Carrington on time.",
      "It was while wearing United training kit that he picked up another injury. Maybe that was due to the efforts made to get fit for England, but we can't be sure. What we can say is that those problems look to be a thing of the past and his fitness record this season has been exceptional.",

      "If Manchester United need an example of a January transfer deal that turned out to be a success, then they only need to look at the captain they are now dreading being without for a week. Bruno Fernandes arrived in January 2020 and is the best signing the club have made in any transfer window for a long, long time.",
      "Those sorts of success stories can be few and far between, but the secret to success in the mid-season market is not to get blown off course. The deals that turn out to be good ones are usually a case of a club fulfilling a long-standing interest in a player, rather than rushing into short-term or panicked deals.",
      "Far too often, United's recent January business has tended towards the latter. The jury is open on last season's mid-season window dealings. Ayden Heaven had a good start to his United career but still has plenty to learn and after a shaky spell, Patrick Dorgu was much improved when returning to the team against Aston Villa on Sunday.",
      "Maybe, in time, those will look like January steals, although United were shopping in the sales a year ago, so tight was their precarious financial situation. The purse strings are a little looser now and a £65million deal for Antoine Semenyo would fit the Fernandes mould. He is a player they have long admired and are making a move now because he is set to leave Bournemouth next month.",
      "But that was not the case when loan moves were made for Wout Weghorst and Marcel Sabitzer in the winter of 2023, or Odion Ighalo in 2020. They might have been loans, but they don't come without a cost and all of them speak to poor squad planning.",
      "Amorim was asked about January plans at Villa Park, in the wake of seeing his captain go off injured, an extremely rare sight in the career of Fernandes, who has missed two games in nearly six years at Old Trafford. His answer might have disappointed fans desperate for a raft of activity next month, but it was sensible and reassuring for those keen to see a new outlook on recruitment.",
      "\"What we cannot do is to reach January and try to do everything in urgency and make mistakes,\" he said. \"And then here we go again with a lot of mistakes. I'm not going to get with Jason [Wilcox] and Omar [Berrada] and I'm going to say we need a lot of players because we have a plan.",
      "\"If we have to suffer, the club comes first. Of course, we are in the moment that we need points, but we need to find solutions and we are going to continue with our plan. Of course, you can feel that in this moment we are going to struggle, but we'll see.\"",
      "We've seen plans change before, but it certainly sounds like Amorim is determined not to go down the short-term fix route. His reference to the mistakes of the past is accurate and those deals have got United nowhere. Loan moves in the middle of the season are unlikely to significantly enhance the quality of this squad.",
      "Amorim would rather face short-term pain, whether that be turning to the academy or getting creative with his squad, such as fielding Lisandro Martinez in midfield. The risk is that it compromises the ambition of qualifying for the Champions League, but then who could add enough quality to strengthen that aim next month, without breaking the bank?",
      "Maybe United will suffer for a little while. Amorim is banking that in the long run, focusing finances on targets that really will add quality will pay off. It sounds like a sensible strategy.",

      "Manchester United are expected to be one of the busiest teams when the January transfer window opens, with a replacement for Bruno Fernandes on their radar and a new attacker being eyed by Ruben Amorim.",
      "The main name is Bournemouth's attacker Antoine Semenyo. The Ghana international's £65m release clause will become active in the first two weeks of the window and United are battling closely with Manchester City and Tottenham for his signature.",
      "Semenyo has scored eight goals in 16 Premier League goals this season and elsewhere, continued speculation around reinforcements in midfield have arisen once more after Fernandes' injury in the 2-1 defeat to Aston Villa.",
      "Before the United captain faced a period on the touchline, United were already plotting a reshuffle in the middle of the park. Carlos Baleba and Adam Wharton are both of interest, with Kobbie Mainoo's own future at Old Trafford set to shape what plays out next month.",
      "Stay tuned with the latest United transfer news and rumours throughout the morning here....",
      "Manchester United and Ruben Amorim will be heading into 2026 without their star player in Bruno Fernandes after he sustained a muscle injury in Sunday's Premier League defeat to Aston Villa.",
      "Fernandes picked up the issue towards the end of the first half at Villa Park before coming off at half-time. Reports have suggested that the United captain could be out for at least a month with a \"suspected soft-tissue injury\". However, Amorim has claimed the club must not make any mistakes in the next transfer window in rushing into signings.",
      "Bournemouth winger Antoine Semenyo has made his preference on his next destination clear ahead of the January transfer window.",
      "Both Manchester City and Manchester United are among a number of Premier League clubs to have enquired about the Ghana international in recent weeks and months. Liverpool, Chelsea and Tottenham have also been linked with the player, but the indication has always been that the two Manchester clubs were leading the chase.",
      "David Ornstein claims that Antoine Semenyo's preference come January is to join Manchester City rather than United. Taking to X, he wrote: \"Antoine Semenyo preference is to join Man City in January.",
      "\"Nothing formal until market opens but #AFCB attacker favours #MCFC. Man Utd pushed hard + never planned to use 25yo at wing-back but winter switch was always tough for #MUFC.\"",
      "It's been another busy week in M16. A 4-4 draw with Bournemouth last week, a 2-1 defeat to Aston Villa on Sunday, speculation around the future of Kobbie Mainoo and an injury for Bruno Fernandes, not to mention attempts to sign Antoine Semenyo.",

      "The club is expected to be active in the January transfer window, but Amorim has stated they will only pursue players who fit the club’s long-term vision. He ruled out signing \"short-term fixes\" to cover for injuries or players at the Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON).",
      "Manchester United are \"pushing hard\" to beat rivals Manchester City and Liverpool to the signing of Bournemouth forward Antoine Semenyo. Reports from Fabrizio Romano suggest the club are eager to trigger his £65 million release clause early in the January window, there is however competition from Chelsea who are reported to have made an approach to Bournemouth.",
      "Joleon Lescott says he isn't surprised by the impact Marcus Rashford is having at Barcelona. The on-loan Manchester United star departed for Spain this summer.",
      "Having fallen out of favour under Ruben Amorim, Rashford initially moved to Aston Villa temporarily in January before heading out on another loan to Barcelona in July.",
      "Since joining the Catalan giants, Rashford has enjoyed plenty of minutes. Hansi Flick trusted the 28-year-old out left in the absence of Raphinha and he has also been deployed as a striker. Rashford has scored seven goals and grabbed 11 assists in all competitions so far this season.",
      "Napoli manager Antonio Conte has launched a fresh dig at United following victory in the Italian Supercoppa.",
      "Both Scott McTominay and Rasmus Hjolund starred for the club as they came out as 2-0 winners over Bologna.",
      "Following the match, Conte said:",
      "“Everyone used to say Rasmus didn’t play in Manchester, neither did McTominay, so why? Ask yourselves some questions there. The staff and I had work to do, there is a reason we are here, after all.”",
      "Nottingham Forest midfielder is United's number one midfield target, according to journalist David Ornstein.",
      "The player has impressed both domestically and on the international stage over the last year or so.",
      "Speaking on NBC Sports, Ornstein revealed that United have already made thie interest known to Forest with Anderson at the 'top of their list' of midfield options.",
      "They do howver face competition from the likes of Man City, Bayern Munich and Chelsea",
      "It's going to be a strange experience for Bruno Fernandes on Boxing Day when he sits down to watch Manchester United and is unable to influence the action. Whether Fernandes has his hamstring wrapped up in the warm at home, or has his big coat on at Old Trafford, he isn't going to know what to do with himself when his teammates take on Newcastle United.",
      "Fernandes is 31 and a veteran of 683 appearances for club and country, but astonishingly, he has missed only four games in his career through injury. Two of those were for Portugal in the March 2019 international break and then two for United in May 2024. He has missed two more games due to illness, in 2017 and 2022, and that is it.",
      "It's a remarkable injury record, but one that was unlikely to last as age caught up with the durable Portugal international. The sight of him clutching his hamstring just before half-time at Villa Park on Sunday confirmed Ruben Amorim's worst fears.",

      "\"It seems like we all can see that in terms of recruitment, they have it right.",
      "\"Yes, you can win the FA Cup, you can win a spot in the Champions League and all that, but at the end, it's all about our identity and seeing that consistently.",
      "\"Having that will be a victory because it has been really hard to see anything in recent years. It's still fragile. It's still early on.",
      "\"I would love to speak the same way in March and say now it's on.\"",

      "He also gave an optimistic update on defender Sven Botman and midfielder Joelinton:",
      "“Sven [Botman] would be in the category of a group of players that are doing well, and again, we hope to get him back pretty soon,” Howe explained. “When that day is, I am not 100% sure. He hasn’t trained with the group yet. But potentially good news, I don’t think he is too far away.”",
      "“Joelinton is getting closer to being able to participate,” he said. “We will see how he trains and looks today and make a decision.”",

Liverpool, Chelsea and Tottenham have also been linked with the player, but the indication has always been that the two Manchester clubs were leading the chase.",
      "The latest report from The Athletic's David Ornstein is that it is Semenyo's preference to join City should he leave the Vitality Stadium next month.",
      "A deal between clubs is yet to be agreed as a little over a week remains before the window opens, but the presence of a £65million release clause that can be triggered before January 10 should make the move straightforward.",
      "If he were to remain at the Vitality Stadium beyond the January window, the release clause would then drop significantly ahead of the summer. That said, interest from Premier League clubs, most notably City, makes a winter exit the likeliest outcome.",
      "Ornstein claims that Semenyo's desire to win trophies was one of the driving forces behind his decision to choose City. Pep Guardiola's side have won six Premier League titles since 2018, with only Liverpool usurping them on two occasions.",
      "In Europe, they have also remained competitive, claiming a Champions League triumph over Inter Milan back in 2023. That year, they secured a historic treble by also winning the league and FA Cup.",
      "City's rivals United were also heavily linked with Semenyo, but a move next month was always going to be a stretch for Ruben Amorim's side. Liverpool were also credited with interest in the player, as were Tottenham, but neither appeared to step up their pursuit in recent weeks.",
      "Chelsea emerged as outside contenders on Tuesday, with reports suggesting they had made enquiries with Semenyo’s representatives. However, it later emerged that they had decided against pursuing the 25-year-old and instead retain faith in their current attacking options.",
      "A move for Semenyo would provide greater depth to Guardiola's attacking options, which already consist of Erling Haaland, Jeremy Doku, Omar Marmoush, Savinho, Oscar Bobb, Phil Foden and Rayan Cherki. City remain locked in a title race with league leaders Arsenal, with just two points separating the sides after 17 matches.",
      "City's immediate focus, however, will be on their upcoming fixtures heading into the New Year. They take on Nottingham Forest away a couple of days after Christmas, before a tricky test on the road against Sunderland on January 2."

      "Sunday, December 21, 2025, will forever be a special day for Jack Fletcher and Shea Lacey, regardless of Manchester United's defeat at Aston Villa. The 18-year-olds will never forget their professional debuts, especially coming for United on a big Premier League stage.",
      "It's an interesting time for two academy graduates to be adding their names to a historic list of youngsters making the step up to the first team as well. Ruben Amorim threw them both on at Villa Park with resources stretched to breaking point, and he did so having been critical of the academy in recent weeks.",
      "The relationship between Amorim and those nurturing the stars of the future could be strained after recent comments, with the head coach not always giving the impression he was happy with the quality or the attitude of those being developed.",
      "However, in the West Midlands, he demonstrated that he was still willing to turn to them when needed. Fletcher came on with 17 minutes remaining and Lacey got the final six minutes, having been an unused substitute on four occasions recently. Both can be happy with their brief cameos.",
      "There could be more opportunities to come. Casemiro will return on Boxing Day, but United will be without seven first-team players, with Noussair Mazraoui, Harry Maguire, Matthijs de Ligt, Amad, Kobbie Mainoo, Bruno Fernandes and Bryan Mbeumo all set to be out. That could hand more squad places to academy kids.",
      "As good as Fletcher and Lacey might be feeling this morning, however, they have been warned that making their debuts is far from the end of the road and after Amorim's recent comments, they will know hard times could be ahead as well. Even for the best players, the path is very rarely smooth.",
      "That is the point Amorim made a week ago when he cited the debuts handed out to Harry Amass and Chido Obi last season, who played for United at the ages of 18 and 17, but now find themselves going through different periods. Amass is playing well for a struggling Championship side and Chido is having a more difficult season at academy level.",
      "Both players reacted badly to those comments, posting photos on Instagram of successful moments in recent months, only to then delete them. Amorim was unflinching in his criticism last week, but made the valid point that it can be dangerous to cosset young players and that sometimes they need to go through tougher spells as part of their development.",
      "\"Sometimes strong words is not bad words. Sometimes difficult moments is not a bad thing for the kids,\" he said. \"We don’t need to be always with accolades in everything, in every situation. We are not helping.\"",
      "Those are words that Fletcher and Lacey should remember. A month from now, the injured players are likely to return, and the Africa Cup of Nations trio of Mazraoui, Amad, and Mbeumo will be back. With a fully fit squad to pick from, Amorim won't be calling on Fletcher or Lacey.",
      "They have had a taste of first-team football for one of the world's biggest clubs, but very soon they will be playing academy football again or having a loan spell in the EFL. When that happens, they should take Amorim's comments on board. They have enjoyed a memorable day in their young careers, but the hard work has barely even begun.",

      "Manchester United's luck with injuries seems to have truly run out in recent weeks. Ruben Amorim was fortunate enough to not be bogged down with too many fitness problems at the start of the season. However, in the busiest period of the campaign, the Reds look thin on the ground.",
      "The Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) absentees were expected but the injuries to Harry Maguire and Matthijs de Ligt have been longer than Amorim had initially hoped. While Leny Yoro, Lisandro Martinez and Ayden Heaven have stepped in to cover for their teammates, the depth of United's squad will be tested again this festive period - this time in midfield.",
      "Before the Aston Villa defeat, Amorim explained Kobbie Mainoo had suffered a calf problem in the last training session before the trip to Birmingham. The length of his absence was unclear at the time but is now a major concern due to Bruno Fernandes' absence.",
      "United's captain picked up a soft tissue injury during the defeat to Villa and was replaced at half-time. Amorim should explain more on Fernandes' fitness during his Christmas Eve press conference but he will at least be out for the visit of Newcastle on Boxing Day.",
      "With this in mind, MEN Sport has taken a look at three ways United could line-up with the playmaking duo this festive period and beyond if needs be.",
      "The one saving grace for United is Casemiro being back and available for the game against Newcastle. The Brazilian was suspended for the loss to Aston Villa but his return means he will be straight back into the starting XI on Friday night.",
      "Partnering him is the question and should Amorim decide to stick with the squad, minus Fernandes, who lost to Villa - Manuel Ugarte could be the player alongside him in the middle. The Uruguayan has struggled since arriving at Old Trafford and his levels did not go up in Casemiro's absence at Villa Park.",
      "In this system, Ugarte would undoubtedly play the holding role with Casemiro looking to be the more creative player. The 33-year-old does have a good passing range in his locker but clearly, he does not hold the same threat as Fernandes or Mainoo in that role.",
      "Alternatively, United could choose to drop Mason Mount back into the pivot alongside Casemiro. Mount is more similar to Fernandes than either Casemiro or Ugarte.",
      "This season has been his best in a United shirt and he is starting to perform to the extent of which he managed to make his name at Chelsea. If Amorim was to give Mount this new role, the Englishman would need replacing in the No.10 position.",
      "An obvious option there would be to recall Joshua Zirkzee to the starting XI. It would be a somewhat full circle moment for the Dutchman having been booed off after being substituted in the first half against Newcastle last season over Christmas.",
      "The wildcard option for United would be to introduce youngster Jack Fletcher into the starting line-up against Newcastle. It would be a case of throwing the 18-year-old in at the deep end and hoping he swims.",
      "However, the Reds do have a history of putting their faith in youth players. Erik ten Hag did it with Mainoo out of necessity and this proved to be the right call.",
      "Having only just made his Premier League debut on Sunday, a Boxing Day start might not be the wise option for either the player, Amorim or the club.",

      "Manchester United have been told that Benjamin Sesko is experiencing the same problems as Rasmus Hojlund did. Ruben Amorim's striker signing has endured a challenging start to his first season at Old Trafford with just two goals to his name from 13 appearances.",
      "A knee injury and the form of Mason Mount has seen him offered limited minutes in United's front three alongside Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo. With the latter away at AFCON, Sesko could be set for an extended run in the team having recently returned from a five-week absence.",
      "However, Paul Parker has explained why he expects him to continue struggling. The former United defender has referenced Hojlund's difficulties in his analysis of how the Slovenia international's strengths are not being utilised.",
      "He told British Gambler: \"You look at Benjamin Sesko and the goals he's scored, it makes me wonder whether Manchester United sent anybody to actually watch him play. When he was at Leipzig, there were lots of balls coming into the box and those big-angle passes being hit at him from deep for him to run on to.",
      "\"He was scoring all kinds of goals there, and at United they're feeding him breadcrumbs. The players in behind him aren't giving him the opportunities, so he's having to do a lot of the work himself which is of course expected, you have to give a little bit back sometimes.",
      "\"That was Rasmus Hojlund's issue, too. He struggled in the Premier League because he wasn't fed enough, but also agility-wise and quickness of feet, they were reasons he struggled, too.",
      "\"That's why he's been given the opportunity to flourish in the Serie A, because the pace of that league is nowhere near the speed of the Premier League.\"",
      "Hojlund has impressed since joining Napoli on loan this past summer with six goals and two assists from 17 appearances, including decisive strikes against Juventus and Sporting CP",
      "In his most recent outing, the Dane helped Antonio Conte's side win the Supercoppa Italiana courtesy of a 2-0 victory over Bologna.",
      "Following that triumph, Hojlund appeared to poke fun at United with an Instagram caption which read: \"What a great decision looks like.\"",
      "The 22-year-old's career at United is almost certainly over, but Sesko is just at the start of his with United's head coach Amorim confident he can hit the heights expected of him.",
      "He said: \"He's returning to competition really fast. He's going to improve a lot. The idea was 70 to 75 minutes. He stopped for a while and we are trying to help the players.\"",
      "Sesko will be eager to find form over the coming weeks with United facing four fixtures over the next 12 days. A potential injury for Bruno Fernandes has furthered the need for him to start directly contributing in front of goal.",
      "Newcastle and Wolves are both set to visit Old Trafford after Christmas before Amorim's side face Leeds United and Burnley away from to kick off 2026.",

      "Manchester United goalkeeper Radek Vitek has had his injury fears eased after undergoing a small operation on his knee that will only see him miss around eight weeks of action. The 22-year-old is enjoying an excellent season on loan at Bristol City in the Championship but he missed Saturday's win over Middlesbrough with an injury and there were fears he could be set for a prolonged spell on the sidelines.",
      "But the Czech Republic youth international is due to back in action in February and rather than returning to United for treatment, he will remain with the Robins with a view to being back in Gerhard Struber's side for what could be a play-off push in the second half of the season.",
      "A club statement said: “Bristol City can confirm Radek Vítek has had a small procedure on his knee. We expect the Manchester United loanee to be available in February. He will complete his rehabilitation at Bristol City.”",
      "Vitek has registered seven clean sheets in 21 games in the Championship and speaking before the game against Boro, Struber stressed how much the United loanee was enjoying his time at Ashton Gate. \"This was a wrong step,\" he said. \"When you see it, you would not [have] realised something had gone on. This was nothing. Sometimes you cannot describe everything, so this is football.",
      "\"He loves to play for this club. He loves to play in this team. He knows, and he is really grateful, about the last few months, how he has grown with his football time and game time. Now we realise the injury, this is football, and you have to be also clear in these moments and hopefully find on Monday the right next step.\"",
      "Vitek is yet to make his senior debut for United since joining the club from Sigma Olomouc as a 16-year-old in July 2020, but he has made more than 50 appearances for the Under-21s and Under-18s. He has also had productive loan spells with Accrington Stanley and Blau-Weiss Linz in Austria before stepping up to the Championship this season.",

      "Ugarte was too weak and Yoro was hugely to blame when Rogers picked it up.",
      "Fernandes picked up a knock a few minutes ago but he has continued.",
      "United got to be happy with how things are going here. They’ve kept Villa quiet for a while now and look the better side at the moment. Starting to show some control, good spells of possession, Cunha looking lively and the Villa Park faithful starting to get really rattled.",

      "Two chances fall to Sesko in quick succession and he should do better. First one is a good save from Martinez, but elite strikers would want to be scoring that. Second is the wrong option, touch round the goalkeeper wasn’t on and should have looked to lift it. A promising sign that he is suddenly in the game, however.",
      "Villa made a fast start to this game, but they've dropped off and some of the fans around the press box are beginning to sound frustrated.",
      "Sesko latched onto a ball into the box and should have done a lot better.",
      "Mount offering some advice to Sesko during a break in play. Striker feeding on scraps at the moment, but he is at least offering an outball. Ugarte has had a very shaky start, Fernandes pressing high and holding midfielder being run ragged at times. United have at least steadied the ship after a rocky opening.",
      "Mount has just been shaking his head - he doesn't look happy with the speed United are playing at.",
      "Dalot did well to bring the ball inside and play a pass over the top to Sesko, but it came to nothing.",
      "Mount has started really well and made a strong challenge just before.",
      "Villa just had three big chances. Lammens made a great save, Heaven made a superb block and Rogers came inches from scoring with a clever backheel. Villa have started full of energy and confidence."

      "When Ruben Amorim looks under his tree on Christmas Day, he is likely to be disappointed. The Manchester United head coach could do with finding a couple of midfielders wrapped up, and no pair of socks will make up for the disappointment of not finding Elliot Anderson or Adam Wharton ready to pop out of a box.",
      "Amorim suggested on Friday that United were unlikely to sign a midfielder in January, but then he didn't expect to finish the game at Aston Villa with Lisandro Martinez and Jack Fletcher in the middle of the pitch. Christmas should be a time of giving, but it's been a costly week for Amorim and United.",
      "Having seen Noussair Mazraoui, Amad and Bryan Mbeumo depart for the Africa Cup of Nations, he saw Kobbie Mainoo limp out of training on Saturday and Bruno Fernandes pull up at the end of the first half. Casemiro's suspension left the outmatched Manuel Ugarte as the only senior midfielder left standing.",
      "Ugarte has fallen out of favour under Amorim, and at times at Villa Park, you could see why. His work in possession was particularly poor. He had to fill Fernandes' box-to-box role in the second half and it's difficult to make a case for a team stretched to that degree getting a result against the Premier League's in-form team.",
      "That run of form is built on shaky foundations if you believe the data geeks, but Morgan Rogers is doing his best to condemn the boffins to the bin this season. He is making a habit of scoring stunners, so the solution is to make sure he can't shoot. Instead, Leny Yoro was so busy handing out gifts he should have been wearing a white beard.",
      "He was too passive against Rogers and paid the price twice. It undid a lot of the good work that United put in at Villa Park. For the second game running, they created chances and looked like a threat going forward, but failed to win. It is now two wins in eight.",
      "Villa came out of the blocks quickly, as you would expect of a team on a run of nine successive wins. Ayden Heaven twice had to block shots from Ollie Watkins, Senne Lammens made a save from John McGinn and Rogers reacted quickly to flick an Ian Maatsen drive towards goal in the six-yard box, only to see it squirm just wide.",
      "United settled their rocking ship, however, and should have led by the midway point of the half. Benjamin Sesko found himself in on goal only to be denied by a sprawling save from Emiliano Martinez. A minute later, it was a clever pass from Matheus Cunha that sent Sesko in, but he took a heavy touch when trying to round Martinez, when he should have attempted to lift a first-time finish.",
      "In a stodgy half, it was Rogers and Cunha who had looked like making something happen, and they delivered within minutes of each other. Rogers had nothing on when he picked up possession on the left touchline, but Yoro never got close to the Premier League's in-form player and let him drift into a shooting position, from where he picked his spot clinically.",
      "Thankfully for United, Matty Cash was also in the Christmas spirit. He was caught napping by Patrick Dorgu, with the ball falling to Cunha. The Brazilian had plenty to do, but his unerring finish was measured to perfection.",
      "The half-time loss of Fernandes was a hammer blow for United. The captain had stopped the game after clutching his hamstring, but continued until the break. He even had a goal-bound shot blocked by Ezri Konsa in that period, but couldn't continue. It meant Amorim had to raid his threadbare bench and the promotion of Martinez to midfield showed what he thought of the other options available to him.",
      "Martinez settled into the game quickly, and United started the second half well, but were again undone by a moment of Rogers' magic. The finish was from a similar angle after the ball bounced clear to him, and again, Yoro was too cautious in trying to stop him. His two shots were worth a combined xG of 0.07 on the spreadsheet. Unfortunately for United, the game was being played on the pitch.",
      "The consolation for Amorim was that his team was being beaten by stunners. So stretched were resources that the Portuguese called a truce with the academy, handing out two debuts, with Jack Fletcher and Shea Lacey coming off the bench.",
      "Diogo Dalot forced Martinez into a save and Dorgu's follow-up was blocked by Cash. The recalled wing-back then stuck a cross on Cunha's head only for the Brazilian's effort to bounce wide. Lacey managed a shot on target from distance and Mount whipped a free-kick onto the roof of the net.",
      "It was an afternoon when United could count themselves a little unlucky, but the results are flatlining again. Casemiro will return on Boxing Day. Who partners him is anyone's guess.",

      "Kobbie Mainoo is absent from the Manchester United squad at Aston Villa after he picked up an injury in the final training session before the trip to Villa Park. The injury is described as a \"small issue\", but it is enough to rule the academy graduate out of a game he might have started.",
      "Mainoo is yet to start a game in the Premier League this season and he is eyeing a loan move away from Old Trafford in January, but Ruben Amorim urged him to stay and fight for his place in his press conference ahead of the fixture against the league's in-form side.",
      "Amorim had hinted he could play a back four against Villa, a formation that would have meant three midfielders and would have resulted in an expected promotion for Mainoo, 20, with Casemiro suspended after picking up a fifth booking of the season.",
      "But his cruelly timed injury means he won't get to add to his 212 minutes of Premier League football so far this season. With Mainoo unavailable, Amorim has stuck by his 3-4-2-1 system.",
      "United are short of options with Noussair Mazraoui, Amad and Bryan Mbeumo away at the Africa Cup of Nations. Mainoo has joined Harry Maguire and Matthijs de Ligt on the treatment table.",
      "Amorim was asked about Mainoo during his press conference and urged him to accept his current predicament and prove him wrong, hinting he could be in the side against Villa.",
      "\"Kobbie needs to fight for his job. I think that is not a bad thing to be on the bench of Manchester United when you are 20 years old,\" he said. \"I remember Ronaldo was on the bench, Rooney was on the bench sometimes. Veron was not playing.",
      "\"So let's continue in trying to avoid the nonsense and the noise. I just want to help the team to win. To help Kobbie to be a better player. I'm not trying to say to Kobbie 'You are a big player here, let’s put him on the bench to show something.'",
      "\"No, no. What I’m saying is the opposite. I'm just not putting Kobe sometimes because I understand that this is not the right guy to start the game. Maybe the next game, Sunday he is going to start.",
      "\"If he plays well, is going to show everyone. 'This guy cannot take me for the team', and I will be so happy, so I don't care. I don't want to show nothing to anyone. I'm just saying that I'm trying to win games and to show to the players that if you do the things right, you will play no matter what the name.\""

      "Manchester United's starting line-up vs Aston Villa on Sunday will be a lot different to the side which drew 4-4 with Bournemouth on Monday night. Noussair Mazraoui was already missing from that team as he linked up with his Morocco teammates ahead of the Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON).",
      "However, he will be joined on the absentee list by Amad and Bryan Mbeumo. They were given special allowance by their national teams to play against the Cherries but will not be available for selection when the team travel to Villa on Sunday. But if that was not enough for Ruben Amorim, there is another matter to contend with.",
      "United shall also be without the services of Casemiro in the West Midlands this weekend. The Brazilian picked up his fifth booking of the campaign, not including the two he received against Chelsea, on Monday night and will therefore be suspended for one game.",
      "His absence leaves a hole in the midfield which will need to be plugged by the Reds. With this in mind, MEN Sport has taken a look at three ways United could choose to line-up in the absence of Casemiro.",
      "United could simply decide to make a straight swap with Casemiro dropping out for Manuel Ugarte. Many predicted the Uruguayan would have a bigger role at Old Trafford once Amorim arrived considering their history together at Sporting.",
      "Instead, Ugarte has failed to push on and has dropped behind Casemiro in the pecking order. This would have been inconceivable at one stage considering the Brazilian was so far off the pace in the Premier League last season.",
      "But in 2025/26, Casemiro remains the best option in defensive midfielder and there is little chance his suspension will damage his chances of returning to the Boxing Day squad vs Newcastle.",
      "There is a lot of talk about whether United are ready to play with four at the back considering the number of absentees - especially against Villa. One option available to Amorim is to return to a 4-3-3 formation which the Reds, and this group of players, have used previously.",
      "Amorim has stated Kobbie Mainoo could feature more in such a system. Should this be the case, Amorim could kill two birds with one stone and ease the tension surrounding the academy graduate's playing time this season while also finding a way around the Casemiro headache.",
      "Without Casemiro, there would still be a place for Ugarte in this formation and both he and Mainoo would benefit from three players in that midfield.",
      "The wildcard option for United would depend entirely on whether or not Amorim is ready to change his mind entirely. Lisandro Martinez has played as a defensive midfielder before - for Ajax when Erik ten Hag was struggling for numbers in that position.",
      "Amorim stated recently he did not see Martinez as a midfielder as he is not taking on that workload currently. Since his long-term injury, the Argentine has been focusing on being a defender but if Ugarte is not seen as a viable option, Martinez could be utilised there.",
      "He could play as the anchor just ahead of the centre-backs which would once again allow Mainoo an opportunity to impress. However, it seems obvious this is a long shot considering Amorim's recent comments on Martinez.",

      "Ex-Manchester United defender Gary Neville has had his say on discussions surrounding a change of formation in the side's 4-4 draw with AFC Bournemouth at Old Trafford on Monday night.",
      "It came as a surprise to supporters when watching the game, as the starting line-up appeared to point towards a back five, but the side shuffled into more of a four during the match.",
      "That is despite head coach Ruben Amorim being insistent over the first year or so of his tenure that he would not change, having previously made his stance clear in the media over a move from the five to a four.",
      "He said: \"No one. Not even the Pope will change [his tactics]. This is my job. This is my responsibility. This is my life. So, I will not change that.\"",
      "Those were quotes that Neville reflected on in the latest recording of the Stick To Football podcast, before having his say on the changes that United made in the game.",
      "He said: \"So, basically, he's saying that he's never going to change the system. On Monday night, that's the average positions, that's the graphic. On Monday night, the average position.",
      "\"I mean, look, my eyes, to be fair, at times thought they were deceiving me because I couldn't quite work out what he was doing. It was in no doubt at the end, but it was no doubt he was in 4-2-4 at the end, but he was also during the game; something was different on Monday night.",
      "\"Has he changed it...? The last 20 minutes he was definitely 4-4-2, 4-2-4, but in the first part of the game, there was something definitely different that had been identified earlier in the week.",
      "\"Apparently, United are a bit annoyed, basically it's leaked out that he's gonna change to a 4-4-2 or a 4-3-3. He was emphatic about not changing, and we've all asked for him to change and be agile. Where are we now in respect to, there's no doubt on Monday he changed.\"",
      "Kitbag has slashed the price of Man United kits and merch with up to 50% off select items.",
      "There were times in the match where United looked back to the team of old, before the habits of recent years snuck back into it, but it's a promising signal for many that the head coach is willing to make those small tactical tweaks.",
      "While many believed there were changes, Bournemouth's boss Andoni Iraola seemed less certain, as he said after the game: \"I think it's the same system they always play, but they adapt depending on who you put to mark them. In the end, it's a very flexible system.",
      "\"Depending on the players, the outside players, depending if you mark them with a full-back, they will go lower, and then with a winger, they go higher.",
      "\"Also, with the positions in the middle, the six and eight, Casemiro and Bruno Fernandes and - even us - we were changing, it's two against two, but it's not two against two.",
      "\"Until we match up well for us, I think we suffer in the first 15 or 20 minutes, something like this and after when we put Alex [Scott] there, we felt much more solid without the ball. And when you feel solid, normally you also attack better.\"",
      "Considering United's upcoming AFCON absentees, it remains to be seen whether the side will continue with those tactical tweaks or if it was a rare change that may not be seen again.",

      "Senne Lammens wore a polo shirt and a navy sweatshirt when he visited Old Trafford after signing for Manchester United. The young goalkeeper looked as though he could be joining United to work in their HR department.",
      "The same observation was made when Lammens reported for international duty with Belgium last week - the 23-year-old was dressed in a beige collared jacket, a khaki t-shirt and chinos.",
      "\"By accident, I saw an article saying he was wearing something boring when he reported for international duty and fans saying they hoped he stays like this,\" laughed Hayk Milkon, one of Lammens' former coaches.",
      "\"This 'boringness' is just the way Senne is, he's really calm and no excesses. He focuses on what he needs to focus on and is open with the people around him. He keeps his feet on the ground.\"",
      "If Lammens looks like someone who could work in an office, every workplace would love to have him in their five-a-side team. United believe they have signed a young goalkeeper with huge potential, and fans who were present at Old Trafford against Sunderland left the stadium buzzing about his debut.",
      "The quirk is that Lammens appears to be a different person when he wears his goalkeeper kit. He made a supremely confident United debut, aggressively commanded his area and kept a clean sheet.",
      "Milkon coached Lammens during their time together at Club Brugge. Milkon is now the youngest manager in the Belgian top-flight and Lammens plays for the biggest club in England.",
      "\"It was Senne with his headphones on. He would go into the gym to do his recovery or some extra top-ups. Or he would just go to relax by playing basketball - he loved to play basketball.\"",
      "Milkon coached in different roles at Club Brugge. He was the assistant of Club NXT (their reserve team), served as their interim manager, was in charge of the Under-18s and eventually became a first-team coach.",
      "His time at Club Brugge coincided with Lammens progressing from the academy to their first team, so he is uniquely positioned to provide insight into United's new goalkeeper signing.",
      "Lammens joined Club Brugge's academy when he was 12. \"He was a guy with huge potential,\" said Milkon. \"As I learned from colleagues who had worked with him when he was much younger, I heard there was a moment that clicked in his head when he became super professional.",
      "\"He was one of the guys during Covid - when the players were not able to train - who was doing a lot at home, he was really going far with this to be the best in these types of areas.",
      "\"Then he continued like this when he joined the first team to train with them. He always wanted to improve. We also had something in place to look at the parameters on which goalkeepers are judged.",
      "\"You see the potential of the goalkeeper based on what they do in games; so their positioning, their decision-making and so on, and Senne was always quite high in these areas.",
      "\"The only bad luck that he had was that the first-team goalkeeper was Simon Mignolet. He's an amazing goalkeeper, so it was difficult for Senne to stay over there in the role of No.2.",
      "\"That would have also blocked his growth, so it was good for him in the end to make the step to go to Antwerp and he did a tremendous job there. It was amazing to see how fast he adapted.\"",
      "Milkon continued: \"I think for us at Club Brugge, it was very clear to everyone that Senne was a top goalkeeper. He would have been the perfect fit for Club Brugge to be the No.1.",
      "\"That was not possible because Mignolet was there. But the parameters that we used to judge his performances indicated he was ticking so many boxes already, and he was consistently doing it.",
      "\"There weren't ups and downs with his performances. He was consistently really high and when you compare this to the top goalkeepers, you have a benchmark to say 'Ok, what potential does this guy have?'",
      "\"He had some chances with the first team at Club Brugge and made a mistake, or maybe two, but in the end it was very clear to everyone that he was a top goalkeeper.",
      "\"It was impossible to try to extend his contract because, again, you have Mignolet, and you cannot block a guy like this. You know he has to go out, he has to play, and he will improve even more.\"",
      "When asked about Lammens' strengths, he said: \"I would say that his decision-making was very good. He is very calm, he sees the solutions on the pitch, he has a quick reaction time and understands the balance between risk and reward, and which decisions are the right ones to make.",
      "\"His clean passing is great, his footwork was really good, and he's just an amazing goalkeeper with the shot-stopping. He made some incredible saves back then already. He's quite a complete goalkeeper.",
      "\"But making the right decisions at a very young age, being very mature with this, was really impressive. And the fact that he is good with both feet is another big strength.",
      "\"For me, Senne is a very calm guy and has all the qualities to be a top professional. That was my impression when I first met him when he was younger and he never changed.\"",
      "Lammens joined Royal Antwerp on a free transfer in the summer of 2023. He was handed his debut a few months later and served as an understudy that season, but earned first-choice status for 2024/2025.",
      "His performances drew attention from the Belgian media. Lammens saved four penalties across a successful first full campaign and received a call-up to Belgium's senior squad in March.",
      "Milkon said: \"I was not surprised when I saw Manchester United had come calling. And to record his first clean sheet, I was really happy for him. Senne is a potential No.1 for the Red Devils - the Belgium national team.",
      "\"He got his chance, he took it, and we're all really proud of him, but we knew it would happen. I believe he has all the capabilities to become the best in the world, so I wish him all the best. I'm sure he will have a very good career in England, and Manchester United should return to the big club they used to be.",
      "\"He will have a positive impact on that, for sure, and hopefully he will be Belgium's first-choice goalkeeper soon. I believe he has the potential, the skillset and the personality to do that.",
      "\"For me, it was just having a tiny little part in having an influence on him at Brugge, but it was the most positive memories of our relationship that we had during this spell.",
      "\"I'm very proud that he is reaching these high levels and not surprised. I believe he will be successful because he is a guy who will not change his focus or start to do something different. He is calm, that's his personality and character, and he wants to succeed. He is hungry and will keep working to be his best.",
      "\"He is so calm, and you have to be patient in football. You cannot worry too much and want things too early, but finding the balance between not being impatient and, at the same time, pushing and demanding what you deserve in a good way, means everything will sort itself out.\"",
      "United staff who have worked with Lammens at Carrington have echoed Milkon's sentiments. He has been described as \"really mature for his age\" and is said to have taken the move in his stride.",
      "Lammens is understood to have impressed coaches during training sessions and a United source said that lots of people have been speaking positively about him. He has already relocated from the luxury hotel where he was initially staying and into a house.",
      "It's no surprise that Lammens likes to play basketball at 6ft 3in, but he is a keen golfer, which is common ground with the likes of Tom Heaton, Luke Shaw, Mason Mount and Harry Maguire.",
      "Matthijs de Ligt, Amad, Maguire and Shaw jogged straight to Lammens to congratulate him after full-time against Sunderland. \"Are you Schmeichel in disguise?\" was chanted at Lammens from the Stretford End.",
      "It remains to be seen whether Lammens will start against Liverpool on Sunday, but it would be a surprise to see him on the bench after delivering a strong debut before the international break.",
      "There would be nothing boring about keeping another clean sheet - this time at Anfield.",

      "“Cole Palmer is another vying for that role and he’s good in the big games. He’s proven that for club and country already. It’s about him getting the games back under his belt after his injury, but for me he’s the most standout player. He plays off the cuff, not that Rogers and Eze don’t, but Palmer stands out the most, the issue is there that he’s got a manager who’s still trying to school him.”",

      "We’ve already had a look at 10 things that occurred throughout 2025 that caught us by surprise, so only reasonable and sensible that we balance the universe with a list of 10 things that we absolutely did see coming.",
      "Tottenham winning a trophy? Surprising. Tottenham freaking out and throwing away the opportunity to kick on after winning a trophy? Expected.",
      "That’s the kind of thing we’re dealing with here. Teams being bad that we thought would be bad, good that we thought would be good, and assorted Floppy McFlopfaces that we all saw coming a mile off.",
      "",
      "Look, obviously we were as surprised as anyone at Tottenham winning a trophy. It simply is not what they do, not what they’re known for.",
      "Sure, they did manage to win it in the Spursiest way imaginable, stumbling over the line in a historically poor final against a historically poor Man United side and having completely abandoned all pretence at participating in multiple competitions to the extent that they finished 17th in the league.",
      "But that’s all irrelevant: they won a trophy. We can’t all be sat here telling them for years and years and years that they needed to stop f*cking about and win a trophy and then go ‘No, not like that’ when they actually do it. Fair’s fair.",
      "So yes, we were surprised by that. We have been surprised by absolutely nothing they have done since, though. An even halfway-sensible club of Tottenham’s size would have recognised the enormous potential of the launchpad it provided. A real chance to be the start of something.",
      "Yet here we are, seven months on from That Night in Bilbao and the joyous cathartic release of the subsequent parade. They sacked the manager who won the trophy. They sacked the man who sacked the manager who won the trophy.",
      "They responded to what really could be one, final crack at the Champions League before slinking back to mid-table forever by appointing a Brentford manager who in the space of a six months has managed to combine all the worst qualities of the last four managers. As small-time as Nuno; as defensively naïve as Postecoglou; as attackingly bereft as Mourinho; as full of undisguised loathing for the club and its fans as Conte.",
      "They’ve got two sporting directors, one of whom is about to sack it all off just a few months after returning because Fiorentina – hardly a superclub – are making eyes at him. Nobody knows what the plan is. Nobody knows who to pin it on now it’s all going wrong, if indeed it is actually going wrong, which nobody knows for sure because of the aforementioned lack of plan.",
      "The Lewis Family have rebranded themselves as new custodians despite having been there all along. They don’t seem to know what to do about the failing manager, or just as importantly who should do it, or, again, if it actually needs doing. What does success or failure here even look like now?",
      "Meanwhile, the launch-pad has turned into a pitfall trap. The club that sacked a manager for winning a trophy but finishing 17th is blundering towards not winning a trophy but still finishing 17th. Or worse.",

Along with the boiling seas. And the AI ants.",

      "We didn’t expect them to be touching Derby’s balls as the worst Premier League team of all time, but we did think they might be quite bad. Relegation trouble bad, if not quite this absurdity.",
      "This season is a culmination of something a long time brewing for Wolves’ owners, and the summer departures and inadequate replacements finally stretched a flawed model way beyond breaking point.",
      "There is no shame in being a selling club, a trading club. Everyone has their place in the food chain. But you cannot just let the quality of the playing squad be denuded to this extent without apparently even trying to source the next rough diamonds that will keep the plates spinning.",
      "Wolves have history for letting a bad end to one season spill over into the next and, from the moment they simply stopped altogether last spring after a brilliant winning run had ended lingering relegation fears always had us concerned.",
      "The extent of the disaster may be a shock. And yes, we’re in the territory of “Our expectations for you were low but HOLY F*CK”. But the existence of some disaster? Entirely, depressingly predictable.",
      "",
      "We didn’t ever buy into the New Era of Liverpool Dominance theory. We didn’t think Pep Guardiola’s Man City Mk II would yet be ready to dominate English football again.",
      "Therefore it stands to reason that Arsenal – even with Floppy McFlopface up front – would be leading the Premier League when the Christmas presents were being opened.",
      "And really this should be a surprise to nobody. It is a position that Arsenal have now occupied on three of the last four Christmas Days. The problem is that we all know what generally happens next.",
      "But having based our thinking up to this point on such solid historical data, we’re now going to say tits to all that. Because this time they’re actually going to do it. They’re actually going to win the league. Probably.",

      "Always thought there’s plenty of truth in the idea that a true test of greatness is how you look at your absolute worst. On that basis, Erling Haaland is pretty, pretty, pretty great after his disastrous and miserable 24/25 season saw him finish with a mortifying return of just 22 Premier League goals.",
      "He finished an embarrassing and lowly third on the scoring charts as a result, failing to win the Golden Boot for the first time in his Premier League career.",
      "It was always likely he’d put that right, and he’s almost secured this season’s Golden Boot already. If he can score three goals in the next two games, he’ll have already matched last year’s 22-goal tally at the halfway stage.",
      "His lead over his nearest challenger Igor Thiago is already eight goals, and nobody else is even within 10. It’s already shaping up as, Haaland apart, a curious kind of year where goals are being shared about by everyone rather than Your Salahs or Your Isaks dominating a team’s scoring charts.",
      "There’s a fair chance that Haaland could miss the rest of the season and still have already done enough.",
      "Only five men beat his current tally of 19 last season. One of them is him and of the others, we can fairly safely say Mo Salah, Alexander Isak and Chris Wood won’t be doing so this season with Bryan Mbeumo definitely odds against.",

      "Last December, Chelsea had put themselves right in the title picture with a fine run of form, but Enzo Maresca wasn’t having any of it. “Little old us?” he said (we’re paraphrasing), “Winning the league? Cor blimey, no, what a silly thing to say. We are but a tiny little David attempting to compete with veritable Goliaths, our only weapon a tiny catapult costing hundreds of millions of dollars and fashioned only from the most basic raw materials of loads of brilliant footballers, some eight-year contracts and clubs around the world where we can park them for a bit with no regard for either player or that club as long as it keeps the tills ringing at HQ.”",

      "",
      "Sacked for an unacceptable 17th-placed league finish with Spurs despite ending that long old wait for silverware.",
      "It was brutal and harsh, but it wasn’t wrong as such. Postecoglou’s preferred narrative that he sacrificed the league to win the cup was true, but only up to a point. He was only able to sacrifice the league campaign because it had already gone really badly wrong before the Europa League got down to brass tacks, and because there were three teams sufficiently abysmal that Spurs had the luxury of calling time on their league campaign after a trio of wins in February took them to the dizzy heights of 33 points from 26 games.",
      "Point here being: that’s still crap. In any normal season, that is not entirely-out-of-the-woods safe. The fact it’s very possibly more points than Spurs will have after 26 games of this season is simply funny, but doesn’t really help Postecoglou.",
      "But the lure and appeal of Postecoglou is obvious. There is a lot to like. But he had been thoroughly rumbled as a Premier League manager.",
      "We knew, though, that someone would be unable to resist. And we knew their regret would be instant and palpable.",
      "We didn’t know it would be Nottingham Forest, but it was as good a shout as any in hindsight. A trigger-happy chairman and a misplaced sense of importance after one half-decent season were a potent combination for being the club to fall into the trap.",

      "They have firmly taken Fulham’s mantle this season as the Barclays’ most mid-table side on the back of their own efforts and the Cottagers’ brief – and now seemingly concluded, to be fair – flirtation with the actual relegation battle.",
      "Brighton’s method of mid-tabling has always leant heavily on the idea of being able to beat and be beaten by absolutely anybody and this year has been sensational on that front.",
      "After eight games of this season they had beaten three of last year’s top five… and absolutely nobody else. That is how you mid-table.",
      "There have been less outlandish wins and more understandable defeats since (even if the nature of a 4-3 defeat to Aston Villa was entirely chaotic) but they remain an extraordinary example to us all.",
      "They have now beaten four of last year’s top seven while managing not a single victory against the teams currently cut adrift to varying degrees inside the bottom three.",
      "You really don’t at this time want to be the other club in any sentence that includes the words ‘…and Tottenham’ but that’s where Brighton are with regard to failing to beat Wolves, and we’re only giving them a partial pass for the reason they have been unable to beat Burnley thus far is that they haven’t actually played them.",

      "Alexander Isak’s injury has prompted mirth from one Mailboxer, while we have some Aston Villa gloating. And they deserve it.",

      "“First and foremost, Nottingham Forest don’t want to do anything at this point in time. They’ve got him under contract until 2029.",
      "“The player is not agitating to move right now, and the fee they’re going to command is in the region of £80-£100m the way things are looking. I don’t think that’s very realistic from a PSR perspective even for the biggest clubs.",
      "“Also in terms of squad and salary space, they’d have to get rid of some pretty significant players if they were going to free up space for someone like Anderson. That’s why I think the winter is not going to be a time for Anderson to move.”",
      "Ornstein continued: “However, the summer could be a completely different story. There is no release clause in his contract, but I do think that Nottingham Forest know that if the right price comes in, they might have to do business.",
      "“I don’t think we’re going to have a repeat of the Morgan Gibbs-White situation should suitable offers arrive.",

      "Despite the many mis-steps made in 2025, there have been some moments of inspiration this year. Handily for features like this, at least one for every Premier League club.",
      "It might be a moment, like an individual signing or a particular substitution even, or it could be a more general shift in direction. Like the first two on the list.",
      "Here is how we see the best decisions made on behalf of each club this year…",
      "",
      "Finishing 10 points behind Liverpool – a gap only that narrow because the Reds swapped their boots for flip-flops as soon as the title was won – highlighted how far Arsenal still had to go to be taken seriously in a title race.",
      "But rather than mope over a missed opportunity while Manchester City had a whoopsie of a season, Arsenal went again, investing the league’s highest net spend, with new sporting director Andrea Berta furnishing Mikel Arteta with the strength in depth he needs to get the Gunners closer to the line and, more likely than ever, over it.",
      "",
      "While many clubs seek to further erode the power of the head coach, Villa have allowed Emery to build the structure he wants. Rather than him reporting to a sporting director, especially now Monchi has departed, Emery has hand-picked the people he wants around him. Only the owners hold more power than the manager and no one can say he hasn’t earned it.",
      "LATEST: Premier League mood rankings as Tottenham plummet and Villa soar",
      "",
      "Bournemouth cashed in on plenty of talent in the summer, especially across their defence. But early on they made clear that Antoine Semenyo would not be sold. Certainly not until January, and only then for a decent fee with plenty of time to source a replacement. The forward’s importance is evident in the fact that as soon as his fine form dipped, Bournemouth went winless. Presumably, there is a list of replacements lined up should United, City or Liverpool cough up the £65million required in a timely fashion.",
      "MORE: Semenyo scenario underlines nonsense of naive Bournemouth’s seven-word declaration",
      "",
      "Admittedly, most of us thought Brentford had f***ed it this summer. They lost the manager who got them into the Premier League and established there before appointing a rookie boss while selling many of their best players. But the Bees know what they are doing. Despite the upheaval, Brentford are exactly where they were at the same point last season, cosy in 12th with 23 points from 56 games, eyeing the top-half finish they achieved last term.",
      "",
      "A triple substitution is generally damning enough for the team concerned, but the lesser-spotted quadruple change is effectively the manager ripping to shreds his own plan and his players’ performances. Which was Fabian Hurzerler’s intention when four numbers went up around the hour mark when Brighton were losing and toiling against Manchester City on the last day of August.",
      "James Milner, Yasin Ayari, Georginio Rutter and Brajan Gruda entered the play and while Brighton’s shape remained roughly the same, they suddenly became much more troublesome for City, who went from dealing easily with their hosts’ direct approach to creaking underneath it. Milner levelled shortly after coming on before Gruda won it late on for Brighton’s only win in their first five.",
      "“Sometimes in football it’s not about tactics, it’s about understanding the profiles from the players,” Hurzeler said after. “It’s about understanding what you need, and in this moment we needed energy, intensity, and the belief to change the game.”",
      "",
      "Burnley’s promotion was based on a defence that broke multiple records and, behind that, a goalkeeper who conceded a stunning 12.7 goals fewer than xG reckons he ought to have. So losing Trafford was always going to leave huge gloves to fill, which Martin Dubravka has done. No keeper has faced more shots and none has made more saves. Dubravka was part of what looked like a savvy summer of recruitment that left Scott Parker with a balanced squad better prepared to take on the Premier League than 2023/24. But it’s still not likely to be enough.",
      "",
      "Not many managers have made as many decisions as Enzo Maresca in 2025, certainly in terms of team selection, but few reaped the rewards that choosing to fly into PSG from the off in the FIFA Club World Cup final did. It may have been a nonsense tournament, but winning it in the manner they did, blowing away arguably the best team in Europe, earned Maresca some major credit with the fans and owners, quietening briefly the doubters that remained despite Chelsea qualifying for the Champions League for the first time under Clearlake’s stewardship.",
      "In New York, Chelsea out PSG-ed PSG, going man to man, harassing the life out of the Parisians to give Cole Palmer the platform to do Cole Palmer things.",
      "",
      "Despite all the wisdom of Oliver Glasner, Palace’s best decision was made for them, perhaps by the officials, who chose not to send off Dean Henderson in the FA Cup final, or by the Manchester City players, when Marmoush was chosen as the penalty taker over Erling Haaland. “To be fair, Haaland might have stepped up, I wasn’t sure which way he’d go,” Henderson said after. “He gave it to Marmoush, I knew which way he was going. I knew I’d save it.” Which he did, and Palace won their first major trophy, catapulting them into Europe.",
      "MORE: 16 Conclusions on Crystal Palace winning the FA Cup",
      "",
      "It’s been some year for Everton. They began 2025 with brand-new owners and preparing to leave their home of 133 years, all the while in a relegation fight they simply could not afford to lose. Which prompted the Toffees to ditch Sean Dyche in early January and rather than appoint a progressive new coach – always a temptation for new owners – they went for the tried and tested method in Moyes.",
      "“This club felt to me like one big family, but looked broken, felt broken and it doesn’t feel like that any more,”  summed up the manager at the end of the season, with safety comfortably achieved just as the Goodison lights were to be turned off for the last time. From there, TFG invested the ninth-highest net-spend of the summer to give Evertonians a team to get excited about in a stunning new gaff. Indeed, Everton aren’t ‘broken’ anymore, thanks in no small part to Moyes.",
      "",
      "We’re not sure who exactly pulled the plug on the deal to sell Wilson to Leeds last summer, but had they dallied any longer, Fulham would surely be in a sorrier state this season. Since November, only Erling Haaland, Phil Foden and Erling Haaland have more goal involvements than Wilson. Now to sort that new contract.",
      "",
      "If Leeds stay up this season, most likely they will look at half-time during a defeat to Manchester City as their turning point. When 2-0 down at the break, Daniel Farke ditched the 4-3-3 and moved to a 3-5-2. It reaped immediate dividends. They hauled back their deficit, terrifying City in the process, and were unlucky to lose in added time. But that second half was enough to make Leeds fans feel that Farke might be on to something.",
      "Indeed he was. In the four games since, Leeds have beaten Chelsea and Palace and drawn with Liverpool and Brentford, all while Dominic Calvert-Lewin goes peak Van Basten.",
      "",
      "It’s been a weird year for Liverpool. They p*ssed the league before May then spent big to strengthen from a position of maximum authority while renewing their two biggest stars. No one really questioned any of those decisions at the time, but not many look as savvy now as the decision that appeared most bungled in the summer.",
      "Had they known they would eventually get Alexander Isak, would they have signed Ekitike, subsequently making the task even more difficult since he was Newcastle’s primary target to replace the Swede? Liverpool might say ‘yes’ but we bloody doubt it. As it turns out, though, Ekitike has been the one summer hit, and the reason why losing Isak to long-term injury is not the blow many might have expected it to be.",

      "“There will be no change. Until the last day of my career as a coach I will try to play from our keeper,” said Pep just a couple of months into his City reign in 2016. And the boss has remained true to his word while also showing a willingness to consider another way.",
      "City have hardly embraced Route One in 2025 but they have at least kept up with the trend for playing direct, finding ways to profit in possession while future-proofing themselves at the back, most obviously with the move for a big goalkeeper who was a long way from the archetypal Guardiola goalie.",
      "",
      "For the most part, 2025 was another year spent treading on rakes at Old Trafford. Especially recently, whenever they have had the opportunity to make serious ground on the top four. But some savvy decisions look to have been made. Buying two exciting forwards; ridding themselves of a goalkeeping clown; keeping Bruno Fernandes, even if that decision came from the player rather than the club, have allowed United to make some progress on the pitch. And however long he lasts, Ruben Amorim can claim to have improved the culture around Carrington by binning the bomb squad featuring three, maybe four energy drains. Wherever Marcus Rashford, Alejandro Garnacho, Jadon Sancho and Antony go, and however they perform, Amorim was absolutely right to stick to his guns in exiling the self-serving foursome.",
      "",
      "After going 17 games without a win against Liverpool, a run that lasted just shy of a decade, Newcastle decided to stop showing the table-topping Reds too much respect when they met in the Carabao Cup final. Eddie Howe’s tactic against a side then 12 points clear was usually to sit back and frustrate but, at Wembley, the Magpies got into ’em. The front three pressed and the midfield squeezed the life out of Liverpool, providing the platform for their first silverware in 55 years.",

      "Forest cop a lot of flak for the whims of their owner, some of it justified. But it would have been more foolish to persist with Ange Postecoglou when everyone could see the conditions and environment were not right for Angeball. Out went the Aussie; back in to Forest came Sean Dyche, and now look at them.",
      "",
      "When it emerged Sunderland were in for Xhaka, more than a few eyebrows were raised, but few anticipated the Black Cats making the signing of the season. Xhaka, understandably, is the poster boy for Sunderland’s recruitment, but they made so many astute signings to become the Premier League’s surprise package.",
      "",
      "Tottenham, like Newcastle, ended their trophy drought but it seems Spurs managed themselves on their way to Europa League glory. Ange Postegoglou would probably dispute Van der Ven’s version of events that led to Tottenham tightening up, but whoever decided that kamikaze football was not a sustainable path to success made one of the few good decisions around White Hart Lane this year.",
      "",
      "The Hammers haven’t got many things (anything?) right in 2025, which started with Potter’s appointment. He was gone 25 Premier League games later, of which West Ham won only six. Was he the root of West Ham’s problems? Absolutely not. But nor was he the answer. With none of the stability that allowed him to flourish at Brighton and a personality too passive for West Ham fans, Potter was doomed to fail.",
      "",
      "The mismanagement of Wolves will be studied in years to come, the Molineux men going from consecutive seventh-place finishes and European football to, quite possibly, the worst team the Premier League has ever seen. That and a whole heap of other catastrof***s happened on Shi’s watch. His departure is perhaps the only good thing to happen to Wolves this season. Who is this holding the new broom? Nathan Shi. Oh. No relation, apparently, but no football background either.",
      "Liverpool reportedly have an agreement with Marc Guehi but waiting for the Crystal Palace player could have costly ramifications.",
      "We certainly didn’t expect everything that football has thrown at us in 2025, but there has been enough entirely predictable stuff to keep us sane.",
      "The Sun bring us the exclusive news that an injured player has a limp, while Antoine Semenyo may have made his decision already.",
      "Alexander Isak’s injury means Arne Slot now has just one recognised striker and could opt to dip into the transfer market in January.",
      "Alexander Isak’s injury has prompted mirth from one Mailboxer, while we have some Aston Villa gloating. And they deserve it.",
      "So that’s 2025 almost done. A lot of things we expected to happen went and happened. But we’re not magic. We didn’t see everything coming."

      "Daniel Farke has introduced Jaka Bijol in a central-defensive three, deployed Brenden Aaronson as a far bigger nuisance through the middle and warmed to the concept of chucking a couple of big lads up front together in Dominic Calvert-Lewin and Noah Okafor.",
      "The starting line-up for their best win of the season, the dismantling of Crystal Palace, could hardly have contrasted more with the side Farke picked to open the campaign, especially in attack.",

      "It took the imminent threat of losing what will surely be his last Premier League job to force that alternate approach, but it has been maintained and delivered the longest unbeaten run of his entire top-flight managerial career, as well as a healthy gap to the bottom three.",
      "The hope will be that this run can continue rather than culminate in such an impressive victory over an obdurate opponent battered into set-piece submission. And it is no blind hope either: Farke and Leeds do appear to have belatedly cracked it at this level.",

      "There might have been an element of frustration in the Burnley fraternity at Scott Parker keeping his reign on life support by ending a seven-match losing run with a spirited draw which will nevertheless see at least one of Fulham or Nottingham Forest render that point moot in a relegation battle which the Clarets seem increasingly chronically underequipped for.",
      "But Broja won’t have been among them after scoring his first Premier League goal in 810 days.",
      "That was so long ago that Mykhaylo Mudryk scored in the same game, and Mauricio Pochettino sent Raheem Sterling on to replace a typically injured Broja after an hour.",
      "Loan spells with Fulham and Everton have only accentuated Broja’s sense of frustration since. The faith Burnley showed to sign him for £20m on a five-year contract despite those well-documented struggles was finally partially repaid against Bournemouth.",

      "The seamless move from 007 agent to ‘no goals or assists outside of Germany’ to ‘no goals or assists against 11 men’ is genuinely exceptional work.",

      "Chelsea’s seasonal crossroads of a cup semi-final, sitting fourth in the Premier League yet closer in terms of points to 12th than 3rd, and likely reaching the Champions League knock-out phase but in the play-offs rather than last 16, feels entirely fitting for a club which often seamlessly flits between glory and disaster.",
      "That general disposition was contained within 90 maddening minutes against Newcastle, whose myriad weaknesses were actively overlooked in the first half before Chelsea finally reacted in the second.",
      "Maresca might feel mysteriously unsupported in the Chelsea boardroom – it remains unclear precisely what his thoughts are in that regard – but the reaction after half-time underlined how he retains the backing of the players, even if Joao Pedro had to pull rank and specifically request the sort of service he belatedly received from Robert Sanchez.",

      "He does not instinctively sound, look or feel like a man preparing to step down and be replaced by Enzo Maresca. After riding out their considerable struggles around this time last year, Guardiola and Manchester City are approaching their typical winter marathon sprint in good fettle.",

      "It will be a source of immense pride for Regis Le Bris that Sunderland’s Premier League games have featured the fewest goals of any team – 38, joint with Everton in an obvious show of loyalty to David Moyes.",
      "That attribute is only heightened on the road. Sunderland’s away games have involved just 14 goals, the lowest in the league. So although only Wolves have scored fewer away goals, the Black Cats have picked up a healthy proportion of their points away from the Stadium of Light.",

      "Thomas Frank should probably consider winning more home games, or even just putting together some more consistent, sustainable and enjoyable performances which don’t rely on Richarlison being the world’s greatest agent of chaos.",
      "But when his World Cup-winning captain gets bullied for what was essentially the winner, having lost possession for the first goal, before being sent off for dissent and then an act of unnecessary petulance, one can easily sympathise with his plight.",
      "That Spurs responded so well and almost salvaged something from the wreckage should not mask just how miserably and hilariously Romero let them down in that moment.",
      "But as Jamie Redknapp said, “what Romero did is what Romero does”. There can be no surprise at his ridiculousness. And when one of your supposed leaders cannot be trusted to manage their emotions, then what hope does the manager or rest of the squad have?",

      "But it can get worse. Not historically, for no team has ever had fewer points after 17 games of a professional English league season since 1888. No team has ever had a worse record at this stage of a Premier League season. No team has ever looked quite this hopeless and, as Matt Doherty put it, like a group of disconnected “cowards”.",
      "The most senior player at Wolves, their oldest and most seasoned professional, described them as “scared” and “nervous” just to be ahead in a game – something they last experienced on October 5 and have rarely looked like doing since.",
      "Doherty forlornly adding that Wolves “have to somehow find something” summed up the plight of a club ambling through life, desperately hoping for a sudden and random change to rescue them.",
      "Having already changed managers and now executive chairmen, and with their approach to the transfer window landing them in this mess rather than seeming likely to save them in January, the options for salvation seem scarce.",
      "Rob Edwards has lost all six of his games in charge, with only Mick McCarthy’s nine-match streak of defeats after being thrown in at the deep end by Sunderland in March 2003 worse. The circle of parity might simply never close this season.",

      "While no team has conceded fewer goals in the first half of Premier League games this season, only four have allowed more in the second than Newcastle. The Magpies truly excel at setting a pace they themselves cannot match.",

      "Chelsea had pinned them back, equalised by the 66th minute and neutralised St James’ Park, even if the complaints over some curious non-penalty calls were entirely legitimate and justified.",
      "It remains the case that the earliest goal Newcastle have conceded in the Premier League this season was in the 35th minute. That it has happened twice – against Liverpool in August and West Ham in November – and they ultimately lost both games does not feel like a coincidence.",
      "While Howe generally sets them up phenomenally well, the outcome of Newcastle games becomes a lottery once weary minds forget the preparation and suffer a setback. One of the best teams out of the traps is among the worst when the race is in full flow.",

      "It’s Christmas, isn’t it? Just about? And what does Christmas mean? That’s right, recriminations and family in-fighting. But also gifts and presents.",
      "The more traditional footballing application is for defensive and goalkeeping howlers at this jolliest time of the year to be called early Christmas presents. Guglielmo Vicario has certainly embraced his designated role as this year’s Banter Santa.",
      "But there’s another way Christmas gifts can manifest. There are certain players who’ve just received one in the shape of an unexpected chance to re-assert their claims on a more significant role over the weeks ahead after recent events.",
      "",
      "To be clear from the outset, we’re not saying anyone here is wishing injury upon a team-mate. Obviously not. But one man’s setback is always another man’s opportunity, and the injury Alexander Isak suffered in the process of scoring for Liverpool at Tottenham over the weekend has certainly cleared Ekitike’s path for the foreseeable.",
      "At the very least, Isak’s apparently lengthy absence provides clarity for all concerned. The framing of the striker situation at Liverpool now becomes entirely different, with even the decision to spaff so much of their resources (time and financial) on two strikers suddenly looking less mad than it has for most of the season to date.",
      "Ekitike is now the first-choice striker for an extended period of time, and in truth it’s a deserved status based on the relative performances of him and Isak across the season. On every metric outside sunk-cost, Ekitike appears the more deserving recipient of a lengthy shot at really establishing himself as the number one number nine. Isak isn’t even a palindrome, for goodness’ sake.",
      "",
      "Christmas is a time for miracles, and truly we witnessed one at Villa Park on Sunday. No, not Aston Villa’s seventh straight Premier League win, an event now entirely expected by all, but a soft-tissue injury for Bruno Fernandes.",
      "This is quite simply an event that does not occur. So alien was it that neither Bruno nor his manager even seemed to realise he’d pulled his hamstring and did nothing about what was a very obvious situation until half-time as Bruno limped around for 10 minutes in baffled confusion at this unusual sensation in the back of his leg.",
      "Bruno’s reliability is legendary. He has never missed more than two Premier League games in a row for Man United. He has been at the club for 221 Premier League games and played in 212 of them. If he didn’t occasionally get himself suspended, those numbers would be more insane still.",
      "He has played well over 3000 minutes of Premier League football in each of his five full Premier League seasons. The maximum a player can rack up is 3420.",
      "So what is about to happen is simply unprecedented. Manchester United are going to play a significant number of Premier League games at what is even for them in their quiet little season a busy period. We truly don’t know what that looks like.",
      "What it definitely is, though, is a huge opportunity for Mason Mount. He has proved rather nicely over recent weeks that he can play alongside Bruno Fernandes, something that was previously extremely doubtful.",
      "But now he has the chance to prove he can actually step in as United’s string-puller-in-chief in the absence of a man who is quite simply never absent.",
      "The ramifications of how that pans out are pretty significant. For Mount, for United and quite conceivably for England. A quick look at how Thomas Tuchel has operated thus far as England manager suggests he won’t need much encouragement to turn to a player he already knows well.",
      "Like this? Love F365? Make us one of your preferred sources on Google.",
      "",
      "The whimsical point to make here is to wonder just how much of a gift getting more chances to perform for Thomas Frank’s Tottenham really is. The prospect of a January escape really might have been more beguiling.",
      "But it does look less likely now with Frank now having to desperately find some way to restore some kind of attacking threat to his team in the upcoming absence of the suspended Xavi Simons.",
      "The Dutchman has been far, far from perfect in his first four months at Spurs. But he has also been far, far from the biggest problem during an increasingly gloomy time that does now look like it really could be a miserable sleepwalk into actual relegation trouble in a season where, unlike last year, such a thing actually exists for real.",
      "Spurs have won only eight games in all competitions since Xavi arrived from Germany late in the window. Xavi has started every one of those eight games.",
      "If that record of being unable to win without him remains in place after the next three games, it is surely inconceivable that Frank remains in place. And the relegation threat will be very, very real indeed.",
      "Johnson has been one of the biggest losers from Ange Postecoglou’s departure. He has a particular set of skills that, more than just about anyone else in the Spurs squad, were ideally suited to Angeball.",
      "His ability to arrive late into space on one side of the penalty area as a cross arrived from the other was often underappreciated. There’s a bit of Sterling Lite about it; it doesn’t necessarily look that impressive even when it’s very effective.",
      "But if it was as easy as it looks, then more players would do it wouldn’t they? Unfortunately, creating chances isn’t really something Frank’s Spurs do. Even more so when Xavi is absent. So Johnson might be getting the most dubious of gifts; a chance to impress under conditions that set him up to fail.",
      "That, though, brings us back to the very start. At least it might hasten his departure from this godforsaken club, and that might be the best gift of all, in a way.",
      "",
      "We kind of think it might actually end up being Kai Havertz who gets the greatest gift, assuming that the Arsenal medical team’s prognosis of a return late this year or early next is accurate. And for goodness’ sake, when has the Arsenal medical team’s prognosis ever been off?",
      "But he’s not back yet, and we must accept the small chance he won’t be for a while. And there is also simply no way we’re grown-up enough to pass up the opportunity to bring a player literally called Gabriel Jesus into a feature we’ve given a lazy Christmas-based hook.",
      "Viktor Gyokeres may have scored the winning goal from the penalty spot at Everton, but he remains Floppy McFlopface. His goal returns aren’t disastrous, but nor are they anywhere near sufficient to make up for the sheer paucity of his wider contribution. These are not Erling Haaland numbers. They’re not even Richarlison numbers.",
      "Jesus is certain to start against a suddenly porous Palace in the Carabao this week and has a clear opportunity to stake a claim to start against Brighton after Christmas. It is not at all outlandish to suggest Gyokeres could be Arsenal’s third-choice striker by February.",
      "",
      "Has struggled to make a significant impression this season since his loan move from Flamengo became a permanent one. But there are just a couple of encouraging signs.",
      "He came on at half-time after a disastrous opening 45 minutes against Newcastle and things at least got a bit less sh*t from there.",
      "And after replacing the injured Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall in the early stages of defeat against Chelsea, he retained his starting spot against Arsenal. Could now get the chance to turn a season of frequent but generally brief cameos into something more substantial in the games ahead, most of which will be against teams who are not Chelsea and Arsenal.",
      "Liverpool reportedly have an agreement with Marc Guehi but waiting for the Crystal Palace player could have costly ramifications.",
      "We certainly didn’t expect everything that football has thrown at us in 2025, but there has been enough entirely predictable stuff to keep us sane.",
      "The Sun bring us the exclusive news that an injured player has a limp, while Antoine Semenyo may have made his decision already.",
      "Alexander Isak’s injury means Arne Slot now has just one recognised striker and could opt to dip into the transfer market in January.",

      "The Red Devils signed Zirkzee from Bologna for £36.5m in July 2024 as Erik ten Hag looked for attacking reinforcements.",
      "However, Ten Hag left just months later and was replaced by Ruben Amorim with the Netherlands international struggling for game time in recent months.",
      "Zirkzee was in and out the starting XI last season under Amorim but their summer reinforcements in attack have seen the Dutchman drop further down the pecking order at Man Utd.",

      "READ: 16 Conclusions from Aston Villa 2-1 Man United: Rogers, Amorim, title deeds and rocking-horse sh*t",

      "“Roma consider the player a top priority, and manager Gian Piero Gasperini is pushing to bring him in as early as January.",

      "“From the player’s side, Roma are making progress. Zirkzee is open to the move, attracted by the promise of regular football, a central role, and the chance to shine again in Serie A, where he previously impressed with Bologna.”",
      "And now Italian publication Il Messaggero has claimed that Roma have made an ‘offer’ of €5m for the loan deal in January, plus another €30m in June to make the deal permanent, while a potential €5m Champions League qualification bonus would take the deal to €40m in total.",
      "The report adds that it ‘represents an acceptable compromise (considering the €42 million paid to Bologna, plus almost €18 million in additional costs) for a player who also sat on the sidelines against Aston Villa yesterday.’",
      "Former Man Utd defender Paul Parker recently claimed that Zirkzee was “nowhere near the level” of summer signing Benjamin Sesko, who has disappointed so far this season.",
      "Parker told AceOdds.com: “He is nowhere near the level of Sesko, who is very unselfish and makes all the right runs, and we also see now how big of a gap there is between the two of them. Zirkzee is just miles away from what is expected when you play at Man United.",
      "“It’s quite ironic actually, that Zirkzee is now playing more because Sesko is injured, but I think Zirkzee would rather want Sesko to be ready and play ahead of him, so he can get his loan move away in January. He might miss out on it now because of Sesko’s injury.",
      "“I don’t like what I am seeing from Zirkzee at all. Everything about him is trying to be flashy and it just doesn’t work. He has to be frustrated, because nothing works out for him. He looks like he is frustrated, and I totally get it, but at the end of the day it is his own fault.",

In recent weeks, the Dutchman looked more like a goalkeeper who might catch the eye of the big boys after a shakier start to the season, with a clean sheet against Sunderland earned with one especially fine save from Omar Alderete’s header.",
      "",
      "Burnley appear in danger of being cut adrift but things might be worse were it not for their Slovakian stopper. No goalkeeper has made more saves than Dubravka having faced 10 more shots on his goal than anyone else. And he might have save of the season wrapped up after this late stop to preserve a win at Wolves.",
      "",
      "Life is rarely quiet when Martinez has the mitts on. He began the season well, then tailed off quite alarmingly, but a clean sheet and a penalty save against Bournemouth was more like it. Then he went to Leeds and conceded a shocker before returning to Villa Park and playing a blinder. Most recently, he made seven saves v Arsenal with narrative out the wazoo. Sat out the win at West Ham before returning to help beat Man Utd.",

The clean sheets v Bournemouth and Nottingham Forest were more like it and though the PSxG at Chelsea – two conceded from 1.2 PSxG – doesn’t look great, Pickford was badly exposed by his defence. David Moyes’ back four was more on it against Arsenal, restricting the leaders to just one shot on target.",
      "",
      "The massive Italian has emerged as City’s undisputed No.1 to the shock of no one and the horror of James Trafford. Donnarumma eased himself in to the Premier League and has been making some important saves, like the double against West Ham to stop the Hammers getting back into the game at the Etihad.",

Vicario conceded eight goals against Manchester United, Arsenal and Fulham from a combined PSxG of 5.7 but under-conceded in that batsh*t game v Newcastle. He was pretty much untested v Brentford, but respite was brief before a shocker at Forest. Vicario copped it from Spurs supporters again against Liverpool when he conceded two from 1.3 PSxG but you would have to look very hard for reasons to be critical for either of the Reds’ goals.",
      "",
      "",
      "A fine display against Arsenal, conceding once from a PSxG of 2.2, capped a run of a few positive performances from Sanchez that took the Spaniard into the black. And then he conceded three goals from five shots on target at Leeds. He might have been the only Chelsea player happy with a 0-0 v Bournemouth and though he conceded two at Newcastle, Sanchez could do little about either before helping himself to an assist for Joao Pedro’s leveller.",

Conceding four from Bournemouth’s PSxG of 3.3 was sub-optimal. Questions were asked after Marcus Tavernier’s free-kick which went ‘keeper’s side’ but we would be looking more at the wall set-up than any failure to react to the shot. Arguably, Evanilson’s strike was more saveable. At Villa, Lammens was beaten twice by Morgan Rogers, who United defenders appear to know nothing of.",

In no game have Forest faced fewer shots on target than Arne Slot’s side managed at Anfield. But Sels was busy again – and beaten twice – against Brighton.

But he has clearly put the work in to prove Jamie Carragher and others wrong, becoming indispensable for the Premier League giants again.",

      "If this were plausible, Man Utd should definitely keep Casemiro for another year, but the 33-year-old is still doomed to at least slip in the pecking order at Old Trafford next year because everyone knows that his long-term replacement, likely Carlos Baleba, is going to be their next marquee signing and become one of Ruben Amorim’s main men.",

      "It's one of them, I was back in a week after because I think this is my passion and it's a positive distraction, it's what I enjoy doing but if I needed to take a month, two months, whatever it might be, there wouldn't have been a problem.",
      "I've been here for so long, it's like my family and at times you see people at football more than you see your family at home and you're so close to them.",
      "It was whatever you need to do, however it's going to look for you, it can look like that and I'm so appreciative for that because like I said there was no pressure on getting back in or having to meet this date or this time, it was whatever you feel like and even if you come back in and you're not feeling great, dip back out if you need to.",
      "I haven't because I love my job, it's a job at the end of the day but it's what you've worked so hard for being a young kid that you can make this your work and I love playing football. And obviously at the minute, you know, I'm injured and that and it is difficult but then it's looking at other ways you can spend your time and positive distractions.",
      "To be honest I've picked up the DJing, so I'm just giving that a go now but yeah because I can't play padel and stuff (because of his injury).",
      "You look at things with a bit of a different perspective on life…football isn't my whole identity as much as you love it so much, it's kind of broadening those horizons and trying to trying to fulfil your life in other ways where I'm not just reliant on if I'm fit and not injured because then, when I do get injured, mentally you can take a bit of a dip because you're so caught up on needing to get back. And so, just broadening those horizons is what I've been trying to do, to be honest.",
      "Hopefully I'll get back from the injury I've got and get out on loan in January.",
      "But I think the thing for me it's about going forward… there's always going to be a piece of you missing. Anybody who's gone through this will know there'll always be a piece of you missing but you learn to just carry on because you have to.",
      "What I'm saying is just because six months have passed, we're still going to talk about our feelings and not act like that's done and that's behind us. There's never any time limit on it.",

      "Antoine Semenyo will be one of the most sought-after players in the January transfer window; Man City and Manchester United are at the front of the queue but Liverpool are also interested - so where will the Bournemouth winger end up in 2026?",
      "Tuesday 23 December 2025 14:41, UK",
      "Manchester United, Manchester City or Liverpool? The race for Bournemouth star Antoine Semenyo is on a knife edge.",
      "Manchester United and Manchester City are still ahead of other clubs and remain neck-and-neck for his signature.",
      "But Liverpool remain interested and are understood to be considering their options in the wake of Alexander Isak's injury.",
      "Spurs, who were interested in the Bournemouth forward over the summer and earlier this season, are moving onto other targets and out of the race.",
      "\"If Liverpool come in for him, he'll go to Liverpool. Liverpool is too good a move to turn down. They have been big admirers of him. They have looked at signing him before.",
      "\"They also have a track record of signing players in January. Luis Diaz looked like he was going to Tottenham and at the last minute Liverpool came in for him. Cody Gakpo looked like he was going to Manchester United.",
      "\"Liverpool don't get involved in a bidding war. They wait until the last minute, until other clubs almost do a deal for a player and then they make a phone call to say they will match the deal.",
      "\"Liverpool are expected to have a quiet January. There is money to spend. Sometimes they move quickly to get a summer target in if they think they are going to go somewhere else.",
      "\"Over the next few days, especially in light of Isak's injury, there will be discussions over whether they make a late move for Semenyo.\"",
      "Kaveh Solhekol:",
      "\"If I'm Antoine Semenyo. I'm looking at that Man City squad and thinking, dream come true to sign for Man City. On the other hand, how much game time am I going to get if I move there?",
      "\"I'm not really sure there is a desperate need for them to spend money in January.",
      "\"Another interesting subplot is Pep Guardiola's future. He signed a new contract that takes him to the summer of 2027, but there is talks already that he might call it a day this summer.",
      "\"What impact could that have on Manchester City's transfer plans? As much as we say clubs buy players, Guardiola has been there for so long that he will have a say in which players come to the club.\"",
      "\"Ruben Amorim has consistently said that the club will make moves in the January transfer window provided it is in the long-term interest of Manchester United.",
      "\"They have kept a keen eye on Semenyo's development. That interest goes further back than the summer transfer window.",
      "\"Semenyo signed a new contract in the summer that included a release clause of £65m. That release clause is only valid in the first half of January. That's because if someone triggers the release clause, Bournemouth want time to find a replacement.",
      "\"There is then a lower release clause in the summer transfer window. Expect some sort of movement in the first half of this transfer window.",
      "\"The interesting thing with Semenyo is if United were to sign him, where Amorim would want to play him.",
      "\"Is he going to take over from either of Cunha or Mbeumo? It's very unlikely. Is it the left-wing back position that Amorim has cited Semenyo? And would Semenyo be happy playing in that position?\"",
      "\"One thing for certain now, Mo Salah will be staying at the club. There's a good chance Harvey Elliott would come back from Aston Villa as well.",
      "\"Whether Liverpool go for a striker or another attacking player like Semenyo, who Liverpool have been heavily linked with as well, we all know he's got a buyout clause in January.",
      "\"Then you've got wide players, as in Salah and Gakpo, who've played a lot of games through the middle as well. You've got young Jayden Danns.",
      "\"That's the way they could go around it because I don't think Liverpool, when you go back a few years when they had a real problem at centre-back, they didn't go and spend big money on someone they didn't want.",
      "\"They won't go out and buy a striker who they don't really want. If they do want Semenyo, that's probably a good way around it.\"",
      "Liverpool - there are two sides to this particular route: short-term and long-term.",
      "Semenyo would be an excellent addition for Liverpool right now, with injuries to Isak and Gakpo - plus Salah's departure to AFCON - leaving Arne Slot's side short in attack for the coming weeks.",
      "That's the short-term, but the long-term vision of Semenyo at Anfield is more complicated. Should Salah leave, then Semenyo could be deemed the natural heir to the Egyptian's role at Anfield.",
      "But what happens if Salah and Slot put their issues aside and the former returns to form? Then once Gakpo and Isak return from injury, where would Semenyo fit in with Hugo Ekitike as well?",
      "Man City - this would be another interesting question regarding squad competition. With everyone fit, would Semenyo get into Man City team right now?",
      "Guardiola has finally managed to settle his squad with Rayan Cherki, Phil Foden and Jeremy Doku acting as the perfect trio behind Erling Haaland.",
      "However, there is a argument that squad depth is still an issue. The recent 2-0 loss to Bayer Leverkusen in the Champions League showed how the floor of City's squad could do with a lift - and Semenyo could help that.",
      "Man Utd - Amorim spent around £200m on bringing in Bryan Mbeumo, Benjamin Sesko and Matheus Cunha over the summer, and now he wants to add more attacking quality to his ranks?",
      "Perhaps a potential January departure for Joshua Zirkzee could open up a spot in the United squad for Semenyo to fill?",
      "One area Semenyo could play is at wing-back, especially with his qualities out wide. But could he play there with Amad Diallo on the other flank? Would that be too attacking?",
      "Bournemouth - Another possibility for Semenyo could be to stay at the Vitality Stadium until the end of the season, especially if his desired team stalls this month.",
      "But the Cherries are a long way off being the European contenders they were last season. With Andoni Iraola's future never certain and Bournemouth's form needing to pick up, there are a few dominoes needing to fall at the south coast.",

      "Tuesday 23 December 2025 20:54, UK",
      "Arsenal are likely to be quiet in January after a busy summer as they feel the squad is capable of winning the Premier League title. A number of players are still to return from injury, including Gabriel and Kai Havertz.",
      "Mikel Arteta has always said they will keep their eyes open for unique market opportunities - elite players or longer-term targets. However, it is accepted deals of that magnitude are usually rare in the January window.",
      "Arsenal are always looking at the European market for young players with potential and are understood to have scouted Elche midfielder Rodrigo Mendoza, AC Milan full-back Davide Bartesaghi and Eintracht Frankfurt forward Jean-Matteo Bahoya.",
      "Players out of contract at the end of the season: None.",
      "The only way that could change is with a significant sale(s) - but Villa want to keep their key players as they close in on a Premier League title bid.",
      "Morgan Rogers, Ollie Watkins, John McGinn and Matty Cash attracted interest in the summer, but all those players, apart from Watkins, have signed new deals since, while the England striker has more than two years left on his Villa deal. The club have no desire to change anything in the first team given they are on a historic 10-game winning run.",
      "The futures of several peripheral players are more interesting, especially Harvey Elliott, although a solution looks clouded. He appears caught between the terms of his loan, a desire to play and a less than convinced Unai Emery.",
      "Elliot's summer move from Liverpool becomes permanent for £35m if he makes a certain number of appearances, but the Villa boss has said this outcome is \"not definitely\" going to happen.",
      "He has already played for both Liverpool and Villa this season, so cannot play for a third club unless it is one beginning a new season in the New Year. That means the only leagues he could switch to before the summer are the MLS, which begins in late February, or the Scandinavian countries, which begin in March. The other solution would be to go back to Liverpool but, in all likelihood, still not play regularly.",
      "One bit of business Villa have already wrapped up ahead of the January window is the addition of 19-year-old winger Alysson, who is set to join from Brazilian club Gremio as a development player. He could end up costing Villa more than £10m.",
      "Players out of contract at the end of the season: Ross Barkley.",
      "Antoine Semenyo's future will dominate at least the first part of Bournemouth's window and is something that could be concluded quickly. His £65m release clause is straightforward but not active for the entire window, in part to protect Bournemouth from being left short of a replacement on February 1.",
      "They want to bring in a winger to replace him and have had ample time to find someone given Semenyo almost left in the summer. Apart from that, Bournemouth are also looking to recruit at centre-back and goalkeeper if the right players are available to improve Andoni Iraola's squad.",
      "The search for a centre-back with height and presence is in part down to Marcos Senesi, a mainstay in Iraola's defence, being out of contract at the end of the season. As things stand, he will be leaving this summer and reports have suggested that is what he plans to do.",
      "Despite signing Djordje Petrovic to replace the outgoing Kepa Arrizabalaga over the summer, goalkeeper is a position Bournemouth are looking to recruit in again to find someone that can compete with the ex-Chelsea man for the No 1 spot.",
      "Bournemouth are in a strong position to go back into the market after a summer window in which they had the best net spend in the Premier League thanks to selling key players Dean Huijsen to Real Madrid, Ilya Zabarnyi to Paris Saint-Germain and Milos Kerkez Liverpool. There is an appetite on the south coast to make signings.",
      "Players out of contract at the end of the season: Marcos Senesi and Adam Smith.",
      "Brentford's recruitment priority is a new defensive midfielder they can build their long-term future around, with Vitaly Janelt on course to leave the club in 2026 and their other options in that position approaching the latter stages of their careers.",
      "Janelt's current contract expires next summer and talks over a new deal have not found an agreement so far. The 27-year-old can talk to foreign clubs in January about a pre-contract for next summer, so Brentford are actively scouting for long-term replacements. They have been looking in several markets including Holland, where they particularly like Feyenoord's Quinten Timber and PSV's Joey Veerman.",
      "Centre-back is another position Brentford are looking at amid long-standing interest from Wolfsburg in Kristoffer Ajer and Ethan Pinnock entering the last 18 months of his contract. The club are have a long list of potential replacements and are among those that like Coventry's Bobby Thomas.",
      "Another top left-winger is also a long-term ambition, with Reiss Nelson only on loan from Arsenal until the end of the season. They tried hard in the summer for Max Beier from Borussia Dortmund to no avail. Could they try again?",
      "Players out of contract at the end of the season: Vitaly Janelt, Mathias Jensen (club hold option to extend), Rico Henry (club hold option to extend) and Josh Dasilva (club hold option to extend).",
      "Brighton are expected to try and sign a successor to Carlos Baleba as part of their January transfer plans, as well as potentially a right-back and left sided centre-back. They could also look at new strikers.",
      "Brighton plan to repeat their successful succession planning in midfield by having a replacement when Baleba moves on. Moises Caicedo was already in place when Yves Bissouma joined Spurs and Baleba was signed in the same month Caicedo joined Chelsea.",
      "There are also other issues at play in midfield, with Mats Weifer moving out to right-back this season, James Milner out of contract in the summer, and also Marseille's desire to hold talks over the permanent signing midfielder Matt O'Riley, who is currently on a straight loan there, also playing into their thinking.",
      "Experienced right-sided defender Joel Veltman is another player out of contract at the end of the season and Brighton have been looking at new options at right-back since at least last summer.",
      "At centre-back, Lewis Dunk has triggered an option to extend his Brighton contract beyond the end of this season by meeting an appearances threshold, but the injured Adam Webster is in the final year of his deal and so a newcomer in this position is wanted.",
      "With Danny Welbeck also out of contract, Brighton must look at long-term striker options too. Fabian Hurzeler has said there is a chance Evan Ferguson could return from a loan at Roma as one option, while the club are always scouting for the next best talent.",
      "Players out of contract at the end of the season: Danny Welbeck, James Milner, Joel Veltman, Solly March (club hold option to extend), Adam Webster.",
      "Burnley are facing an uphill task if they are to avoid relegation and are therefore planning to be busy in January to make a fist of trying to stay up.",
      "Although there is money to spend, they are particularly looking in the loan market so as not to get caught with big wages and big fees if they ultimately go down.",
      "Given it is a World Cup year, there are lots of players around the Premier League and Europe not playing regularly who are looking to make a case to their respective national teams.",
      "Players out of contract at the end of the season: Martin Dubravka, Josh Laurent, Vaclav Hladky, Ashley Barnes.",
      "Chelsea will not pursue a move for Bournemouth forward Antoine Semenyo after making an enquiry about signing the player in January.",
      "No major arrivals are expected at Stamford Bridge in January with the focus firmly on the summer windows in 2026 and 2027. Next month will be about moving on those fringe players that the club could not shift in the previous window.",
      "Raheem Sterling, Axel Disasi and Tyrique George were all available for transfer in the summer and could be on the move this time around.",
      "Sterling is the only player that remains in the 'Bomb Squad' after Disasi returned to first-team training in November, but finding a move for the winger will likely be more complicated because he wants to stay in London for his family and is on big wages.",
      "Despite Disasi's return to training, a January exit is still likely. Sunderland, Bournemouth and West Ham showed interest in him over the summer, while he was also offered to Crystal Palace, and Chelsea are expecting the centre-back to attract more suitors in the January window.",
      "Chelsea have been impressed by George this season but he wants to play regularly and there is so much competition for places across the front positions, which is limiting his game time. He nearly joined Fulham on Deadline Day and there is expected to be interest in him again.",
      "Players out of contract at the end of the season: None.",
      "Captain Marc Guehi's future tops the agenda at Selhurst Park after he nearly joined Liverpool on Deadline Day. His contract expires at the end of the season and this is the club's last chance to cash in.",
      "Palace believe Liverpool are the only club looking to sign him for a fee in January and clubs around Europe are queuing up to sign the England international on a free transfer next July. He can talk to foreign teams about a pre-contract agreement from January 1 and Bayern Munich are one club expected to approach him.",
      "Palace head coach Oliver Glasner has said he expects Guehi to stay until the summer - but chairman Steve Parish has suggested in previous comments over the summer that he would be reluctant to let him walk away for nothing.",
      "Guehi holds most of the cards and it remains unclear what his decision will be, with Barcelona, Man City and Real Madrid also potentially there for a free transfer next summer.",
      "Glasner has been critical about Palace's summer business in general, feeling there was not enough investment, and there is uncertainty around his future with his contract up in the summer as well, not helping with clarity for any potential incomings.",
      "The Palace boss has said he expects one or two signings in January and they want another forward given Ismaila Sarr is now at AFCON. They are considering an approach for Tottenham's Brennan Johnson, while Club Brugge's Christos Tzolis was a target in the summer.",
      "Palace are also actively looking at right wing-back options in the wake of Daniel Munoz's knee injury, in case it keeps him out for an extended period. Their other options, Nathaniel Clyne and Rio Cardines, are not quite at the level to provide cover long-term.",
      "Palace are eager to tie Daichi Kamada to a new deal with his current contract up at the end of the season. As it stands, from January he will be free to discuss a pre-contract with foreign clubs over a potential free transfer at the end of the season.",
      "Players out of contract at the end of the season: Marc Guehi, Daichi Kamada, Nathaniel Clyne, Jefferson Lerma (club hold option to extend), Naouirou Ahamada.",
      "Everton are expected to be active in January and are prioritising the signing of a striker as they aim to add a different profile to their current options, Thierno Barry and Beto.",
      "Ivan Toney, who is attracting interest from a number of Premier League clubs, is a player that Everton have had a look at but any deal would likely be expensive. Toney is open to returning to the Premier League especially as England World Cup places are still to be decided, but Al Ahli do not want to lose him at this stage.",
      "David Moyes would prefer Premier League experience, even on loan, and Manchester United's Joshua Zirkzee is another player they like, but he wants to stay and there would be competition from Roma and others.",
      "Everton are keen to add a specialised right-back with Jake O'Brien and James Garner often filling in at the position, and with club captain Seamus Coleman, 37, nearing the end of his contract - and career.",
      "There is also desire to sign a central midfielder, even on loan, to cover for the loss of Idrissa Gueye, who has gone to AFCON. Kobbie Mainoo and Kalvin Phillips, both of whom possess the Premier League experience Moyes wants, are players Everton like.",
      "Players out of contract at the end of the season: James Garner (club hold option to extend), Vitaliy Mykolenko, Michael Keane (club hold option to extend), Idrissa Gueye (club hold option to extend), Seamus Coleman, Harry Tyrer.",
      "Marco Silva did not hide his frustrations about the lack of depth in Fulham's squad after Newcastle knocked them out of the Carabao Cup quarter-finals, and he will be hoping to address those problems in the January transfer window.",
      "Fulham are expected to be active with central midfielder, winger and striker on the list of positions they want to strengthen after a difficult first half of the season.",
      "Signing a top No 8-type midfielder was a big priority in the summer, missing out on players like Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall to Everton, and Alex Iwobi - one of three players Fulham lose to Nigeria at AFCON - has filled in there, so there is still a strong desire to bring in a player of that profile.",
      "Summer signing Samuel Chukwueze, who has recently impressed, is another that goes to AFCON, while Adama Traore is in the final year of his deal and attracting interest from West Ham in January, so Fulham are also exploring winger options ahead of his potential departure. Getting Harry Wilson to sign a new contract is also a priority.",
      "Up-front, Fulham have two good striking options in Raul Jimenez and Rodrigo Muniz, but Muniz is recovering from surgery and the club must plan for the future without Jimenez given he is now 34 and into the final year of his contract. One striker Fulham liked in the summer was Romulo before he joined RB Leipzig.",
      "Players out of contract at the end of the season: Ryan Sessegnon, Harry Wilson, Adama Traore, Raul Jimenez, Tom Cairney.",
      "Leeds United are in the market for attacking players to boost their survival chances, but have said they are maxing out PSR this season, which means there will be limitations to how much business can be done and increases the likelihood of loans.",
      "There is an expectation at the club that there will be at least one signing in January but it is hard to foresee Leeds bringing in any more than two. Leeds' failed attempt to sign Harry Wilson on Deadline Day shows that there is some wiggle room financially.",
      "Sales could be an option to create more financial headroom for January signings and Daniel Farke has said the club should be open to the possibility if it can improve the team, but insists there are no plans to move any of his players on.",
      "The chances of the Wilson deal being revived in January are slim because the two clubs are close to each other in the table and the forward is now playing a starring role at Fulham, although his deal is up in the summer and there has been no resolution over his future.",
      "Leeds still want to bring in a player of Wilson's profile with Dan James' injury leaving them even shorter on wingers and they are also exploring potential deals for strikers to add more depth up front.",
      "Farke has switched to a 3-5-2, but wants his team to be flexible, as shown when he reverted to a back four mid-game against Liverpool and Brentford - a tweak that helped Leeds come from behind to draw in both games - so their plans are not shaped around one formation.",
      "Players out of contract at the end of the season: Illan Meslier, Sam Byram, Karl Darlwo, Alex Cairns.",
      "Liverpool could be busy again in this transfer window even after spending £200m+ net last summer, especially after their struggles this season and Mohamed Salah firmly put his future on the agenda.",
      "Arne Slot insists he no longer has an issue to resolve with Salah after restoring him to the squad - but little time has passed since the Egypt forward's bombshell interview and questions will continue to be asked amid strong interest from Saudi Arabia.",
      "Salah is currently at AFCON and may not return until late in the window if Egypt go deep in the tournament which would kick the can down the road. As it stands, Liverpool have had no official contact from a Saudi Pro League club and focus in the Middle East has been on the summer.",
      "Liverpool would have signed Guehi for £35m on Deadline Day had Palace not pulled the plug at the last minute, and they will remain reluctant to overpay for a player that will soon be available on a free transfer. There is significant competition they were clearly keen to get ahead of in the summer, for the right price. Guehi, of course, was ready to move to Anfield in the summer.",
      "The Guehi situation has also been somewhat tied to Ibrahima Konate, who is also out of contract in the summer. Although Liverpool have remained committed to re-signing him to a new contract they will not budge from their existing wage structure. Konate has had interest from Real Madrid.",
      "Bringing in a holding midfielder has also been on the agenda since Slot's first summer in charge when Martin Zubimendi turned down a move to Anfield but the impressive performances of Ryan Gravenberch as the No 6 have so far put those plans on ice. Their other option, the 32-year-old Waturo Endo, has made only five Premier League appearances and enters the last 18 months of his deal in January.",
      "Andy Robertson is another player whose deal is up at the end of the season, but the 31-year-old has said he is relaxed about the situation. The left-back chose to stay at Anfield in the summer amid interest from Atletico Madrid and wants to resolve his future in private.",
      "Players out of contract at the end of the season: Ibrahima Konate, Andy Robertson, Freddie Woodman, Rhys Williams.",
      "Manchester City have emerged as the frontrunners in the race for Antoine Semenyo in January but both Liverpool and Manchester United remain interested.",
      "Signing another elite left winger has been on their radar since the summer, when they tried for Rodrygo from Real Madrid and were willing to sell Savinho, who has since signed a new contract, to Spurs had that happened.",
      "Pep Guardiola has ruled out back-up goalkeeper James Trafford leaving in January despite the England international becoming unsettled over his role with Gianluigi Donnarumma the clear first-choice, but City are open to Stefan Ortega leaving.",
      "Long-term, City are also looking at central midfield cover for Tijjani Reijnders, with Mateo Kovacic injured and getting on, and Bernardo Silva out of contract in the summer.",
      "Right-back was an area City looked at in the summer but the impressive performances of Matheus Nunes in that position have knocked that down the priority list. Tino Livramento has been a long-term target, but Newcastle have no plans to let him go.",
      "City are one of the clubs with an interest in signing Marc Guehi on a free transfer next summer, with John Stones in the final year of his contract plus Nathan Ake soon turning 31.",
      "Players out of contract at the end of the season: Bernardo Silva, John Stones, Stefan Ortega, Marcus Bettinelli.",
      "Manchester United are another club interested in Antoine Semenyo but look set to miss out to rivals Manchester City. The biggest aspect of the decision for United is with £65m potentially hitting the summer kitty without significant sales.",
      "While they are not currently at risk of breaching PSR, such an outlay could have serious repercussions on what they can afford to spend in the summer, when a defensive midfielder is the absolute priority.",
      "So that might be why they are only willing to let Kobbie Mainoo leave the club for a significant fee, rather than on loan. A string of Premier League clubs are interested, though only a handful could afford a permanent deal for his value.",
      "As far as Ruben Amorim is concerned, Mainoo remains a key part of his plans and there is a desire for him to stay at Old Trafford, despite asking to leave on loan in the summer and hardly playing since. What is difficult to predict is how the player might react if he stays on the fringes and how that could impact the club's stance.",
      "United's long-term bid for midfield reinforcements is regardless of Mainoo's future, and more because Casemiro is expected to leave in the summer when his contract expires. The priority is to bring in a top No 6-type in the summer and they have interest in the likes of Adam Wharton, Carlos Baleba, Elliot Anderson and Angelo Stiller among others.",
      "Centre-back is another position that United are looking at but again more likely for the summer, with Harry Maguire currently out of contract at the end of the season. The England international, who joined United in 2019, has said he does not know what the future holds for him.",

      "A defensive injury crisis means Newcastle may now have to look to bring in reinforcements in January. Tino Livramento has a minor injury on the same knee he suffered an ACL rupture which requires the club to be careful but that is not straightforward in their situation.",
      "Newcastle have been looking around for right-backs already with Kieran Tripper's contract up at the end of the season. He has attracted interest from Saudi Arabia and Europe. As things stand, he is free to discuss a pre-contract with foreign clubs from January.",
      "Lewis Miley has shown he can cover at full-back but Newcastle are concerned about the number of options available to them heading into the busy festive period. That raises the possibility of a potential incoming in the January transfer window.",
      "At the time of writing, Dan Burn, Tino Livramento, Sven Botman, Trippier and Emil Krafth are out injured and if they lose anyone else then Newcastle will be in big bother. Lewis Hall has also been dealing with a hamstring strain which is far from ideal.",

      "Neil and Anderson are also one of nine players whose contracts expire in the summer so can speak to foreign clubs from January 1.",
      "Sunderland's squad has outstripped expectations so not a huge amount of incoming work is being looked at. It is understood the club are looking to make an addition or two though, mainly on the wings, but also possibly a defensive midfielder.",

      "Johnson, scorer of the winning goal in last season's Europa League final, is of interest to Crystal Palace. The Wales international has struggled for game time under Frank this season. Richarlison has been sharing the striker position with Kolo Muani in the absence of Solanke, but he was offered to Palace as a makeweight in a potential deal for Eberechi Eze in the summer, so doubts about his long-term future at Spurs remain.",
      "Spurs were interested in signing a left-sided centre-back in the summer only for other positions to take priority but it remains a position they are keen to add in ahead of the January window as they look to provide more depth behind Micky van de Ven. Ben Davies is a cover option currently but out of contract in the summer.",

      "As things stand he is unlikely to sign a new deal at Fulham and West Ham could try to reunite him with Nuno in January in a cut-price deal.",
      "Players out of contract at the end of the season: Callum Wilson, Guido Rodriguez and Andrew Irving, George Earthy and Lukasz Fabianski.",
      "Wolves have a delicate balancing act in January given they are highly likely to be relegated this season.",

      "Gary Neville on Ruben Amorim's change in Man Utd approach: \"I'm happy he's adapting... he couldn't carry on as we saw against West Ham and Everton. That would find the manager in a lot of trouble - more of what we've seen between Bournemouth and Villa is going to find the manager in a job\"",
      "Monday 22 December 2025 06:11, UK",
      "Gary Neville feels Ruben Amorim has given himself a blueprint to move forward after a notable change in style this week - but Roy Keane remains unimpressed with \"one of the worst teams in the league\" without the ball.",
      "For the first time in his tenure, Amorim has visibly moved away from the rigid 3-4-2-1 formation he had previously stuck with both at Old Trafford and across his managerial career, displaying a level of flexibility which had previously become a bone of contention for Manchester United supporters.",
      "After deploying a hybrid back four in Monday's 4-4 draw with Bournemouth, United put on another improved display despite losing 2-1 to in-form Aston Villa at Villa Park and deserved more than they got for the second game in succession.",
      "Speaking on the Gary Neville Podcast, Neville said: \"I thought it was a really good performance, but the details of the two goals have cost them.",
      "\"Now that's going to continue to happen whilst they don't have the likes of Harry Maguire and Matthijs De Ligt, and they don't have players that would make them a lot stronger.",
      "\"What I have seen in these last two games is a couple of things. One, the manager has changed. Quite obviously, the system that he said he would never change, the five or the three [at the back], the two in midfield, the two wing backs and the three up front, that has been thrown out of the window in the last two matches. That's a good thing.",
      "\"I'm happy that the manager is adapting to what's happening out there because of what's happening with AFCON, but also I think there's an element where he couldn't carry on as we saw against West Ham and Everton at home.",
      "\"More of that would find the manager in a lot of trouble - more of what we've seen between Bournemouth and Villa is going to find the manager in a job, and will allow him to build something, because you can build off what you've seen here.",
      "\"Manchester United can still finish in the top five and they've missed three or four opportunities in the last three weeks to do that, but if they can get those players back from AFCON and they can stay fit, they can do something.",
      "\"Ruben Amorim has got to approach it the way in which he has in the last five or six days. The system has been tweaked - more than tweaked - and I think with [Mason] Mount, [Matheus] Cunha, [Bruno] Fernandes, [Bejamin] Sesko, [Bryan] Mbeumo and Amad [Diallo] out there on the pitch, not all of them but probably four or five of them, they will cause a lot of teams a lot of problems.\"",
      "Keane was similarly impressed with Man Utd's attacking output, with Amorim's side only outscored by Manchester City this season, but felt that was little excuse for the ease with which they were cut apart for both of Morgan Rogers' fine strikes in their latest defeat - their fifth from 17 league games.",
      "Leny Yoro was singled out for criticism for a lack of intensity in closing down Rogers when he first received the ball before cutting inside and netting a stunning opener, while Keane was just as frustrated by Diogo Dalot's attempts to block a cross leading up to his second.",
      "\"You can have all the talent in the world, but you have to roll your sleeves up and when the game gets a bit tight you say you're going to do your bit for the team,\" he said on Super Sunday. \"This isn't a tricky winger, it's just a little shimmy. He's like yeah, have a cross. This ends up being the winning goal.",
      "\"It's not like someone's done a brilliant trick or run at him with real pace. You get down low, you get your body in position. You say if you're going to get a cross in, you're going to have to do remarkably well.",
      "\"There are too many players who don't do enough. Not just Dalot. In the last two games Man Utd have conceded six goals. What chance have you got? Newcastle are coming up in a few days, they'll come to Old Trafford and enjoy it, they'll have runners.",
      "\"These are the ugly bits of football. We know you've got the other bits, but you've got to do the ugly bits. That's what all the top teams do.",
      "\"But you can also dig deep, you can win playing ugly. You have to find a way to do that.",
      "\"Out of possession they're one of the worst teams in the league. With the ball they're good, but if you want to be a top footballer, it's about what you do out of possession.",
      "\"Man Utd cut corners, take too many risks and I'm glad they get punished. I like to see teams getting punished who take chances and let their team-mates and fans down.\"",

      "United were worth their equaliser, having played the more enterprising football in the opening 45 minutes. But it became trickier in the second half, Bruno Fernandes going off injured and Lisandro Martinez coming on in midfield with Kobbie Mainoo absent.",
      "Rogers' second, another curled effort beyond Lammens, restored Villa's lead and this time Cunha could not find the response. The Brazilian forward should have done so. His unmarked header from Dorgu's left-wing cross missed the target from six yards out.",

      "\"It is really strange. During this year, especially at this time, we have so many problems, but we have to cope with that. I think [Jack] Fletcher did his first game, so that is good news, [Shea] Lacey the same, so we will try to find solutions and go for the next game.",

      "The England international isn't just a key figure in the team anymore; he's been given the keys by Unai Emery and now puts the team on his back when it matters most.",

      "Monday 22 December 2025 21:47, UK",
      "Our football betting expert Jones Knows called EVERY match result correct across the weekend, going nine from nine with the accumulator paying 2,000/1 - can he stay perfect?",
      "Marco Silva looked crestfallen watching Fulham being knocked out of the Carabao Cup in midweek.",
      "Another chance to challenge for a trophy came and went. And the harsh reality for Fulham is that Silva, who is out of contract in the summer, has probably outgrown them now. He's a very ambitious coach.",
      "Ask yourself this: would you rather keep Fulham in mid-table season after season or potentially go take a job where challenging for honours and playing in Europe is on the radar? Silva has earned a crack at that.",
      "And with uncertainty growing about his situation, that could spell trouble for Fulham over the next six months or so. A club that are famed for downing tools when safe in mid-table, that regression may come sooner.",
      "In contrast, there's a freshness and enthusiasm in the way Nottingham Forest are playing now under Sean Dyche. With Murillo and Nikola Milenkovic back as a pair, a surge up the table is expected. Forest draw no bet at 11/10 with Sky Bet is a tasty wager.",
      "This one is primed for chaos.",
      "Both teams rank inside the top four for xG created per 90 when trailing in a match. It's where Villa are actually thriving when it comes to the data.",
      "What this tells us is that if the scoreline changes early, the match won't settle. It'll stretch, open up, and turn into an end-to-end spectacle with two dangerous attacks.",
      "Villa have taken 15 points from losing positions this season, more than any other Premier League side. That's not luck. That's mentality, style and intent.",
      "When they fall behind, they double down on attacking patterns rather than protecting themselves. At Villa Park, that philosophy is heightened, too. Against a Manchester United side that have averaged 3.5 total goals per game this season and one that also thrives in broken, transitional games, that points towards this being a potential banger.",
      "Both teams to score and over 2.5 goals at 10/11 with Sky Bet is a winner in waiting.",
      "Newcastle's injury crisis has had a huge influence on this market where Chelsea are now favourites at 29/20 with Sky Bet. It's a price which looks skinny to me but the team news angle still is a betting proposition as whoever fills in at right-back for Newcastle is going to be under serious pressure if Alejandro Garnacho starts.",
      "All signs suggest Lewis Miley is set to deputise on that side and at 5/1 with Sky Bet to be booked, that's a price that simply doesn't marry up with the task he's facing. When Garnacho is on song, he is the definition of a stress test for defenders.",
      "When at Manchester United, since the start of the 23/24 Premier League season, Garnacho drew a card every 206 minutes. That's elite territory for an attacker and it's not accidental data. He plays on the edge, he attacks defenders with pace and he's very theatrical under contact.",
      "Burnley going away from home still carry that old narrative of blunt, toothless and just happy to compete. But when you hone in on Bournemouth's defensive numbers of late, this trip to the south coast looks far more open than the prices suggest.",
      "Andoni Iraola's men have conceded 21 goals in their last nine games, and that isn't coming from freak results or red-card chaos. It's a structural issue, one that revolves around the centre-backs being far too exposed and unable to defend with the same one-to-one authority as Dean Huijsen and Illia Zabarnyi.",
      "Burnley to score over 1.5 goals is 100/30 with Sky Bet.",
      "I am going back to the well in taking on Brighton in this spot because the well is still overflowing with value. Brighton, for all their fluidity and lovely patterns, simply do not enjoy playing teams who go direct and turn them.",
      "Under Fabian Hurzeler, Brighton have won 19 of 36 Premier League games when their opponents have played under 15 per cent of passes long, but only three of 17 games otherwise. Sunderland are fifth in the long passes metric of all Premier League teams this season and are likely to undertake a style of play that causes Brighton issues.",
      "The away team are 6/5 with Sky Bet on the double chance.",
      "A bet that stands out here at the prices is Manchester City to win the cards race at 7/2 with Sky Bet, meaning we need City to be shown more cards than West Ham to land the pot.",
      "Despite the bulky price, this bet has landed in eight of City's last 13 games in all competitions, which points to them carrying a cynical edge to their game of late. This includes in a similar home game against Leeds where they won the card race 4-1 despite being the outsiders in the market.",
      "Across their last eight games, West Ham have seen the opponents average two cards per game with the threat of Jarrod Bowen and Crysensio Summerville triggering some card-worthy action from defenders.",
      "Wolves top the charts this season for fouls committed and Matt Doherty really got into the spirit of things on his return at Arsenal, making a whopping five fouls.",
      "He will be tasked with keeping Kevin Schade quiet - a player that leads the way for fouls drawn this season for Brentford at 1.62 per 90. This makes Doherty's price to make two or more fouls at 5/4 with Sky Bet very appealing.",
      "Of Arne Slot's last 17 wins away from home at Liverpool, 12 of those have seen under 3.5 goals too. That is a relevant trend when assessing the best way to back a pro-Liverpool angle in this fixture.",
      "We all know about Tottenham's issues in forward areas and them being able to create quality chances. All their key attacking metrics have the look of a team that should be battling relegation: 9.6 shots per game, 3.3 shots on target per game, 1.0 expected goals per 90 and 1.8 big chances created per game. It's an underlying attacking process which is the fourth-worst in the Premier League. Another blank may follow here.",
      "You can get 21/10 with Sky Bet on Liverpool to win and under 3.5 goals - a nice boost on the Evens for a Liverpool win.",
      "Our old friend of Arsenal to win and under 3.5 goals at 6/5 with Sky Bet is the line that appeals.",
      "Arsenal don't do goal-glut football. Quite the opposite, really. Across all competitions, their matches are averaging just 2.7 goals per 90 minutes, a surprisingly modest return for a team perceived as a free-flowing force. Mikel Arteta's men have seen 15 of their wins this season land the 3.5 goals too, including last weekend against Wolves where they delivered the odds in dramatic fashion.",
      "With Everton certainly missing Idrissa Gueye and Iliman Ndiaye and potentially without Keinan Dewsbury-Hall and Jack Grealish, David Moyes is going to have to go back to basics for a result. Defend deep, get the crowd involved and try to cause problems from set pieces. That's unlikely to be enough to work against this Arsenal machine.",
      "This is a fixture where the league table tells you very little, but the calendar tells you everything. At full throttle, with both teams fresh and raring to go, Palace have shown they are the better team.",
      "However, three games in six days, different opponents, different tactical demands and now a trip to Elland Road - one of the most physically demanding environments in English football - tips the scales firmly in Leeds' favour.",
      "Palace's schedule is unique and brutal. And what we've seen from Daniel Farke's team in recent weeks is that they make games an intense battle.",
      "This isn't a bet against Palace's quality. It's a bet against the schedule they're trapped in. Leeds at 8/5 with Sky Bet is best bet of the weekend material.",
      "1pt treble on: Leeds to win, both teams to score & over 2.5 goals in Aston Villa vs Man Utd & Nottingham Forest to win (13/1 with Sky Bet)",
      "Super 6 have made a millionaire already this season, but could you be the next big winner? Enter the next round for free."

      "Friday 19 December 2025 15:18, UK",
      "Ruben Amorim says there is a level of entitlement at Manchester United as he defended his comments about the club's academy last week.",
      "Last week, when quizzed on not using academy graduate Kobbie Mainoo, Amorim used Harry Amass and Chido Obi as examples, suggesting they were not at the level required for United at the moment.",
      "Both players then posted pictures on their Instagram accounts, which were subsequently deleted, seemingly in response to Amorim's comments. Amass posted a picture of him with a player-of-the-month award at Sheffield Wednesday, while Chido's image was of him celebrating scoring for the U21 side.",
      "When asked about Amass and Obi, Amorim defended his \"strong words\", suggesting the young players at the club feel \"entitled\" and the culture needs to change.",
      "Man Utd boss Ruben Amorim after being quizzed on his use of academy graduate Kobbie Mainoo:\n\n\n\"I don't know what is going to be the future [for Mainoo]. Let's see after this match.\n\n\n\"Amass is now struggling in the Championship. Chido (Obi) is not always a starter in the U21s.\n\n\n\"All these guys played when a lot of people were saying sack the manager!'",
      "\"Sometimes strong words are not bad words, sometimes difficult moments is not a bad thing for kids. We don't need to always be accolades in everything, every situation.",
      "\"You guys talk about players who speak against clubs because they feel entitlement, then you have legends say if you don't play, leave because everyone is wrong. No, let's stay and fight, let's overcome and maybe the manager is wrong. I have the feeling we need to fight against this feeling.\"",
      "\"I'm the first one to say I'm failing inside the pitch,\" he added. \"I have that feeling. We are not performing the way we should be but outside the pitch I guarantee I'm not failing this club.",
      "\"We talk about the players sometimes forget what it means to play for Man Utd, we as a club forget sometimes who we are. That's the feeling that I have.",
      "\"It's the environment, the kids feel entitled and free to respond to the manager with a picture. My office is open but nobody is coming to me. That's the way we can solve things.",
      "\"We need to change as a club.",
      "\"I didn't say anything wrong, I spoke about how the luck of playing for Man Utd. Sometimes you play for Man Utd and see different realities and you understand football can be so different and you are really lucky to be at Man Utd. That was my point, but let's move on.\"",
      "Meanwhile, Amorim says there is no problem with Mainoo after his half-brother's T-shirt stunt and hopes the Manchester United midfielder fights for his future at the club.",
      "The homegrown 20-year-old talent has gone from FA Cup hero and starting the Euro 2024 final for England to a bench player over the last 18 months.",
      "Mainoo saw a request to leave on loan rejected in August and is still waiting for his first Premier League start of the campaign, leading to speculation he could depart United in the January transfer window.",
      "The midfielder came off the bench in Monday's 4-4 draw with Bournemouth at Old Trafford, where his half-brother Jordan Mainoo-Hames wore a 'Free Kobbie Mainoo' top and later posted about it on social media.",
      "Asked if he has spoken to Mainoo about the incident, Amorim laughed and then said: \"No, it was not Kobbie that wore the T-shirt.",
      "\"He is not going to start because of the T-shirt, but he is not going to the bench because of the T-shirt. He is going to play if we feel that he is the right guy to play. That is not an issue.",
      "\"I am used to [it]. I am here for a year. It's not new, so we have to deal with that, but I am not going to do something to Kobbie because someone in his family is doing something.\"",
      "It felt like a message to the changing room.",
      "When asked about the situations around Bruno Fernandes and Kobbie Mainoo this week - Amorim repeatedly spoke about how his office is always open for players to talk to him.",
      "When asked about two young players - Amass and Obi - who both posted messages on social media last week which seemed in defiance of Amorim discussing their lack of first-team involvement this season (both posts were then deleted) - he talked about the feeling of entitlement among the younger players at the squad.",
      "He repeated that word, 'entitlement'.",
      "It is hard to disagree with the United manager. Obi made seven appearances last season while Amass made five for the first team.",
      "Amass this season has continued his development at Sheffield Wednesday on loan this season - a loan the club felt would seriously improve his future prospects at the club, especially his defensive qualities.",
      "Obi - having watched him multiple times for the U21s, still has plenty of improvement to go with coaches in the academy demanding more in his work off the ball and build-up play.",
      "But both - as well as other players last season - received opportunities because of the multiple injuries to the squad while also prioritising the Europa League. This is what Amorim tried to explain last week and he expanded on today.",
      "There will be a high chance for those in the academy like Shea Lacey and Jack Fletcher to potentially impress in the next month and I expect a few on the bench on Sunday with Matthijs de Ligt and Harry Maguire injured, Casemiro suspended and Amad, Bryan Mbeumo and Noussair Mazraoui away for AFCON.",
