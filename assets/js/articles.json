      "Former Manchester United midfielder Nicky Butt reckons Ruben Amorim might be having second thoughts about letting Marcus Rashford depart in the summer, considering his side's current struggles. The England star produced a brilliant display for Barcelona in Thursday's 2-1 triumph over Newcastle United in the Champions League.",
      "He bagged a brace within nine minutes during the second half, marking his first goals for the Catalan club. Rashford initially opened the scoring just shy of the hour mark, nodding home from Jules Kounde's delivery.",
      "He then extended the advantage with a spectacular right-footed effort from distance, giving goalkeeper Nick Pope no chance.",
      "Anthony Gordon managed the sole strike for the home side during injury time.",
      "Nevertheless, it proved the ideal homecoming for Rashford, who secured a loan switch to Barcelona earlier in the summer.",
      "The 27-year-old found himself axed from Amorim's squad after facing harsh words from the Portuguese boss.",
      "Prior to his Camp Nou switch, Rashford hadn't appeared for the Red Devils since December 2024 and subsequently joined Aston Villa on a temporary deal.",
      "Speaking on BBC's Champions League highlights programme, Butt suspects Amorim could be second-guessing his choice to allow Rashford's departure, whilst United battle for reliable firepower during their poorest campaign start in 33 years.",
      "\"I think I would be thinking, 'What have I done? I've let that go.' And Man United are obviously struggling,\" he said.",
      "\"But players need to move on if it's not going well because you need to be loved and Marcus definitely needs an arm round and needs to be loved and when he is, he shows what he can do tonight.\"",

      "Former Newcastle United and England striker Alan Shearer reckons this weekend's showdown with Chelsea could determine whether embattled Ruben Amorim has a future at Manchester United. The Red Devils have failed to demonstrate any signs of progress this term, suffering their worst Premier League start in 33 years.",
      "Ruben Amorim's side have managed just a solitary victory against Burnley, while losing twice and drawing with Fulham. Following last weekend's humiliating 3-0 thrashing by Manchester City at the Etihad, Chelsea presents another pivotal fixture despite still being in the early stages of the new campaign.",
      "\"It was men against boys last weekend at the Etihad,\" Shearer told Betfair. \"They were miles apart in terms of ability, system, attitude and whatever else you want to name despite what Man United have spent in the summer.",
      "\"I don't think they can afford to be beaten like that again this weekend. If they were then you'd have to fear for what's going to happen going forward for the manager.",
      "\"Something must improve rapidly. Man United can't be lingering in 14th/15th/16th in the Premier League.",
      "\"There hasn't been an improvement at all up to now and that can't continue with what they spent. There has to be something that gets them going and if that doesn't happen quickly then everyone knows the rules when it comes to football management.",
      "\"It's on both the manager and players but I do think there's a lot in the system and despite what the manager says, he's not going to change his ways, he'll stick to that system. He's either going to die on his sword or get the success that he needs.",
      "\"At the minute it looks really negative, and I don't think a lot of those players are suited to the system.",

    "body": [
      "The pressure on Ruben Amorim has been steadfast ever since his arrival at Manchester United 10 months ago. The Portuguese boss replaced Erik ten Hag last November as the Red Devils boss, but almost a year on, it's been a simply dire period for fans across the globe.",
      "After a 15th-placed Premier League finish last season, the club's worst since the inaugural season of the top-flight, clear progress continues to seemingly evade the 40-year-old in his bid to bring success back to Old Trafford.",
      "With United having played six games across all competitions this season, they've earned just one victory which came against Burnley and are already out of the EFL Cup due to a shock upset loss against Grimsby Town.",
      "Despite the negative results, Amorim has dug his heels in when it comes to continuing with his system, as he said following their 3-0 defeat to Manchester City: \"When I want to change my philosophy, I will change. If not, you have to change the man. I believe in my way and I am going to play my way until I want to change.\"",
      "The ex-Tottenham Hotspur midfielder earlier this month admitted he's surprised Amorim has remained in his job at Manchester, given the disappointing start of the season he's presided over.",
      "\"I can't believe Ruben Amorim is still in charge,\" he said on talkSPORT. \"When are they going to let it go? When are they going to just… do what Sheffield United have done, just swallow their pride [and say] 'we got this wrong?'",
      "\"Get Ole back in. They can't carry on doing this. They'll go down. They'll be playing Rotherham next season.\" Believing the Portuguese manager has run his course at Old Trafford, O'Hara claimed a re-appointment of Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, who was sacked by Besiktas last month, would be a step in the right direction for United.",
      "\"I believe that Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, if you get him back in, go back to the formation that they were playing before, get the players back onside, give them a bit of freedom, and I think they can maybe just calm everything down.\"",
      "The ex-United first-team coach lamented Amorim's stubbornness to his footballing philosophy and claimed that if the negative results continue, he sees a reality where the 40-year-old faces the sack before Christmas.",
      "Speaking to football betting site BetVictor, the Dutchman said: \"Could Ruben Amorim be gone before Christmas?, Absolutely, he could well be. And I think if he keeps being as stubborn as he is and the results don't improve, he doesn't keep winning, then there's definitely no other way than the club has to make a decision.\"",
      "In the possibility that Amorim exits the club, Meulensteen advocated for Michael Carrick's return to United, with the former England midfielder having been out of a job since his sacking from Middlesbrough this past summer.",
      "He added: \"Michael Carrick might be the obvious option if Ruben Amorim is to go. Obviously Michael Carrick still knows quite a few players that were there when he was there. So he's still got some good inside information. He obviously knows the club. He knows what's expected from the club.\"",
      "Foster, 42, said the possibility of dismissing Amorim has been an idea for a while, given how their season went last year, but a decision hasn't been triggered yet. The former United goalkeeper urged the manager to change his system if he wants a change of fortune.",
      "Speaking on his Fozcast podcast, he said: \"It's been rumbling for a long time. Nobody wants to really commit to it [sacking Amorim] but I guarantee you that if they've got eight points and they're still in 14th position after eight games, somebody's going to have to pull the trigger.",
      "\"It can't carry on like that. It's nearly a year since he's been managing and it's been proven that it's not working. I get that he wants to play that system, but if you haven't got the players, you can't play it. Surely you just play your best players in their best position, because then you'll get the best out of them.\"",
      "The former Chelsea striker said the consistently bad performances and results United keep providing will eventually give Jason Wilcox, United's director of football, no chance but to make a decision on Amorim's future.",
      "\"I think Manchester United have got real issues now,\" Sutton said on BBC Five Live's Monday Night Club. \"How long has he been in charge? Is it his team now? Yes, it is. Is it working?",
      "\"If he is going to be that stubborn and be unwilling to change... If he is going to stick with this system and it is not working, then I am afraid Jason Wilcox and the Man Utd hierarchy have a decision to make based on performances we have seen this season.",
      "\"What is the ambition of Man Utd this season? I don't really know, but the fact that they are already out of one cup and there's no European football... The pressure is well and truly on.\"",
      "Amorim holds a woeful 26% win ratio at United with just eight wins in 31 Premier League games in charge. Despite the horrendous record, Pallister was insistent that patience will exist in regards to Amorim's future which he said won't be harmed by their loss to City.",
      "\"I think Mason was desperate to do well. I think he started [the season] okay. And then we lose them both to injuries. I think there'll be patience. Everybody's going to put him under the pump for sticking with the back three.",
      "\"It's not what a lot of teams do. And the longer it goes, and the longer we struggle with it, the more questions are going to be asked.\"",
      "The Manchester United legend said Amorim has no time to waste following the below-par start to the season. With United already nearing the bottom of the table just four games in, Neville admitted their upcoming clash against Chelsea holds tremendous weight regarding his future at the club.",
      "Speaking on the Gary Neville podcast following their derby day defeat, the pundit said: \"Ruben Amorim is going to come under big pressure, he’s going to come under big pressure, Manchester United are 14th in the league.",
      "\"It’s only a few games in, it’s four games in, but next week, if Manchester United lose and they go and they go to 15th or 16th and it’s five games in, before you know it we’re in October and Manchester United are in the bottom half of the table and that’s where they couldn’t be, having spent £200 million, with him having a pre-season.",
      "\"They might be seventh, eighth, ninth, they could be in those types of positions, but they can’t be in the bottom half of the table, so there’s got to be a turnaround pretty quickly, and the manager’s idea has got to land very quickly with the players.\"",
      "Amorim has made no qualms about walking away from United if the ownership and fans no longer have belief in his ability to do the job. The former Soccer Saturday presenter took Amorim's words on board and admitted he believes there's a possibility he resigns. \"I think there is a chance,” said Stelling on talkSPORT.",
      "\"I think he has looked pretty disillusioned and some of the things he has said - says to me he is pretty disillusioned. They are playing Chelsea this weekend but I am not sure the players are buying into [the system].\"",
      "The Newcastle icon is another who pointed out the lack of suitability the United players have shown in Amorim's style of play. In what was utter domination by City in their 3-0 triumph this past weekend, Shearer admitted that Amorim can't afford to lose like that against Chelsea.",
      "Speaking to Betfair, he said: \"I don't think they can afford to be beaten like that again this weekend. If they were then you'd have to fear for what's going to happen going forward for the manager. Something must improve rapidly.",
      "\"Man United can't be lingering in 14th/15th/16th in the Premier League. There hasn't been an improvement at all up to now and that can't continue with what they spent. It's on both the manager and players but I do think there's a lot in the system and despite what the manager says, he's not going to change his ways, he'll stick to that system.",
      "\"He's either going to die on his sword or get the success that he needs. At the minute it looks really negative, and I don't think a lot of those players are suited to the system.\"",

      "Manchester United remain convinced that Ruben Amorim is the manager to take them forward, and they've taken inspiration from Adoni Iraola's early Bournemouth struggles. The Spaniard endured a difficult start, but now has the Cherries flying high in the Premier League.",
      "Amorim is closing in on his one-year anniversary at Old Trafford, but he has struggled to have a meaningful impact. He's largely taken the team backwards and presided over their lowest ever Premier League finish last season when they ended in 15th.",
      "This term, despite more than £200million being spent in the summer, he's endured more setbacks. The Carabao Cup loss at Grimsby Town was a new low and United were then outclassed in the Manchester derby - beaten 3-0 at the Etihad Stadium on Sunday.",
      "Despite that, the Old Trafford hierarchy believe Amorim is still the right man - and feel that his improvements are backed up by the stats and metrics. A positive change from last term is that United are creating far more chances with the highest xG in the Premier League.",
      "The powers that be in Manchester have noted how Iraola endured a horror start at Bournemouth - failing to win any of his first nine games with six of those defeats. Yet their performances, according to the stats, were positive and the Cherries have benefitted from their patience, reports The Telegraph.",
      "Once Iraola got his first win, it in turn set the team on a run of seven wins in nine matches - one of those being a memorable 3-0 victory at Old Trafford against Erik ten Hag. Bournemouth repeated that result last term, only this time it was Amorim making the decisions in the dugout. They finished ninth last season and currently sit fourth.",
      "The Portuguese coach's record makes for grim reading; he has won just 17 of his 47 games in charge. In the Premier League, since taking charge, United would be placed bottom of all the 17 teams that have been in the league since his arrival.",
      "Criticism has come due to the fact the ex-Sporting Lisbon boss has refused to alter his philosophy or show any pragmatism. He's rigidly stuck to his 3-4-3 formation, which has not bought the desired results, but Amorim has frequently claimed the club will have to sack him if they want to play another way.",
      "He said: \"It's not a record that you should have in Manchester United. There are a lot of things that you have no idea what happened during these months, but I accept that. But I'm not going to change. When I want to change my philosophy, I will change. If not, you have to change the man.",
      "\"So, we'll talk about that every game, every game that we lose. 'I don't believe in that, in the system', or whatever. So, I play my way and I'm going to play my way until I want to change.”",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Lamine Yamal and Bruno Fernandes were both left gobsmacked after Marcus Rashford's dazzling double during Barcelona's 2-1 triumph over Newcastle United in the Champions League. Rashford, 27, who swapped Manchester United for Barcelona on a loan deal this summer, netted two goals within eight second-half minutes, helping Hansi Flick's team kick-off their European campaign with a win.",
      "His first goal arrived in the 58th minute when he connected with Jules Kounde's cross and sent a perfectly aimed header into the bottom corner. Not long after, the England star scored his second with an extraordinary long-range shot, smashing the ball into the net via the crossbar from the edge of the box, leaving Nick Pope helpless.",
      "Reacting to the spectacle on Instagram, Fernandes posted a clip of Rashford's second goal with a speechless message, simply adding two mind-blown emojis and a shocked face emoji. Teen prodigy Yamal, who missed the Newcastle match due to a groin problem, also shared his reaction to Rashford's stellar performance but, like Fernandes, didn't use any words; he reposted a post from Barcelona to his story before adding a person gesturing OK emoji and a fire emoji.",
      "Rashford also received encouraging messages from several of his former United teammates. After the England star posted on his own Instagram account, Rasmus Hojlund, Alejandro Garnacho, Joshua Zirkzee Antony, Jadon Sancho, Ethan Wheatley and Jesse Lingard each left a comment.",
      "Hojlund said: \"Well done Marcus [red love heart emoji].\"",

      "Zirkzee wrote: \"Love it [red love heart emoji].\"",
      "Antony posted a face with open mouth emoji, dashing away emoji and two fire emojis, while Lingard put two fire emojis and Wheatley left a smiling face with heart eyes emoji.",
      "Meanwhile, Garnacho, Antony, Hojlund, Sancho, Zirkzee, Lingard, Tyrell Malacia, Wheatley, Jack Grealish, Ayden Heaven, Brandon Williams, Joe Hugill, Bukayo Saka, JJ Gabriel, Richarlison, Amadou Onana, Phil Jones, Harry Amass, Shola Shoretire and Robin van Persie were among the million-plus people to like Rashford's post. Following a goalless streak in his opening four matches for Barcelona, Rashford has now broken his duck in spectacular style, with the Wythenshawe-born striker reflecting on his Catalan adventure after the match.",
      "Rashford added: \"It is an amazing experience. I have always been a huge admirer of Barcelona, as most people my age have watched them play from when we were younger.",
      "\"It is amazing football and amazing players. We just want to win as much as possible. I am very motivated and determined. The quality we have in the team excites me. It is so refreshing to play with these players.\"",
      "Newcastle gave Barcelona a run for their money, with Anthony Gordon netting a late goal to reduce the deficit, but it was too little, too late to change the final outcome. \"Here is not an easy place to play football, I know that first hand,\" Rashford concluded.",
      "\"The first half was very cagey. We did well, we tried to control the game - in spells - but it is very difficult to play against this team. I am really pleased we managed to win the game.\"",

      "Erling Haaland's goal against Napoli means he's become the quickest player in Champions League history to score 50 goals. It is the latest piece of history claimed by the Norwegian and he assumes the record from ex-Manchester United star Ruud van Nistelrooy.",
      "The Manchester City frontman opened the scoring in Thursday night's 2-0 win with a smart header and further underlined his status as one of Europe's elite marksman. He's bought up his half century of goals in a staggering 49 games.",
      "Van Nistelrooy had held the record for years but it took him 62 games to score 50 times. He was prolific, particularly during his time in Manchester, and had sat top of that list. Haaland's exploits though now have him above the Dutchman and Lionel Messi, who was the third-quickest.",
      "Pep Guardiola said of Haalands' latest achievement: \"What can I say? The numbers speak for themselves. We are lucky to have him. Just to congratulate him, because he's alongside goalscorers like van Nistelrooy, [Robert] Lewandowski, but especially the two monsters Cristiano [Ronaldo] and Messi for 20 years, for Erling to be there is unbelievable.\"",
      "Unlike Van Nistelrooy, Haaland can boast a Champions League winners' medal following his success in 2023.",
      "The striker burst onto the European scene with Red Bull Salzburg before his quality convinced Borussia Dortmund to secure his services.",
      "He remained prolific with the German club but has seen his numbers excel since moving to Manchester. His best single-season effort came in 2022/23 when he scored 12 times in 11 games and 27 of his 50 goals have come while wearing the City blue.",
      "Haaland has only scored the two hat-tricks on the European stage, which is the same number as Van Nistelrooy.",
      "It means he remains some way off the record of eight which is jointly held by Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo - the two highest scorers in Champions League history.",
      "Ronaldo sits as the most prolific player in Champions League history having scored 140 times across his spells at United, Real Madrid and Juventus.",
      "Messi is 11 further back but with time on Haaland's side he has been tipped to rival the iconic duo at the top of the list.",
      "When asked if Haaland can one day surpass Ronaldo's mark, Guardiola said: \"In that rhythm, yeah. He's not injured, he could play for 10 or 12 more years, and he maintains this progression, absolutely.\"",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Paul Scholes has named Barcelona star Pedri as his new favourite footballer after another virtuoso display. The La Liga giants were in Champions League action on Thursday night as they beat Newcastle 2-1 at St James’ Park.",
      "Marcus Rashford stole the headlines on his return to an English stadium, scoring a brace including a stunning second from distance. But it was the quiet efficiency of Pedri in midfield which caught Scholes’ eye.",
      "The Manchester United legend posted an image of Barcelona's number 8 Pedri, with the caption ‘My new favourite footballer’.",
      "The Spain international made a similar impact on Rashford, who swapped Old Trafford for the Camp Nou, admitting he was blown away by his talent.",
      "“If you didn’t know his age, you’d think he was 28 or 29 because he’s very mature and understands the game perfectly,” he said earlier this summer. \"He plays at his own pace, and that makes it easy for strikers to keep up with him.”",
      "Scholes’ comments come after he admitted that the options at his beloved United aren’t working as their slump continues. Under-pressure manager Ruben Amorim is strictly sticking to his 3-4-2-1 formation, despite their prolonged struggles.",
      "United spent big on forwards during the summer, bringing in Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko for a combined £193million, but neglected recruiting a new midfielder.",
      "That has left Amorim struggling to build an effective partnership in midfield, with Bruno Fernandes being utilised deeper alongside the ageing Casemiro.",

      "He said: \"I don't think the quality is there.Whatever two out of the four or five they have got in [midfield] - Casemiro, Bruno [Fernandes], [Kobbie] Mainoo - whatever combination he seems to try doesn't seem to work.",
      "\"That's a big issue. I thought all summer the absolute priority was a centre midfield player with legs, who can play and can control a game.",
      "\"The recruitment side went to buy forwards. That did need addressing, but did it need three of them? I'm not sure it did.\"",
      "Amorim defiantly defended his midfield selections in the wake of their humbling 3-0 defeat to neighbours Manchester City. \"Guys, I understand how football is,\" Amorim said. \"The results will dictate all the narratives.",
      "\"I am trying to be rational and I don't lie to myself. I see the record. I understand the frustration of everybody and I understand any decision that came with that.",
      "“But that conversation about the two midfielders, the pair, Kobbie and Manu [Ugarte], I understand all these narratives. But then when I look at certain games, we play with two. It is the same thing.",

      "Sir Alex Ferguson has admitted that concerns about dementia are constant with his younger brother now experiencing symptoms. The legendary Manchester United manager, who won 13 Premier League titles, two Champions Leagues and countless other trophies, is now 83 and has been retired for more than a decade.",
      "He is now spending more of his time involved with dementia charities, with the syndrome impacting his only sibling Martin. Ferguson also lost his beloved wife Lady Cathy in 2023, after being married for 58 years.",
      "During an interview with BBC Breakfast to recognise National Playlist Day, the ex-United boss spoke about his brother's situation and how it could potentially affect him in the future.",
      "\"I have a situation myself, with my brother,\" he said. \"It's not easy. I have to be in touch with him a lot. He recognises me [but] the memory's not great.",
      "\"But he's not bad. He's not getting any worse, let's put it that way, which is very encouraging.\"",
      "\"It's at the back of my mind all the time. You think, 'I wonder if he's in just now', or if I should give him a phone [call]. I try to do that each day.",
      "\"I keep telling him: 'Write things down.' I think he tries to do that, but he forgets a lot of the time. When you get to my age, you do have a little worry about whether your memory is going to stand up.",
      "\"I'm 84 in December and there are moments when I forget things. I probably did that 20 years ago, 30 years ago... no-one's blessed with a 100% memory. But when it comes to football, when I was a manager, the memory has always been important. Now I do a lot of crosswords, I sing a lot and read.",
      "\"I tend to go into history - the American civil war. I went to a few of the battlegrounds in America, which I really enjoyed.\"",
      "Ferguson also revealed that following the loss of his wife, he found himself sitting alone in his house for long periods, before moving closer to family and going on more worldwide trips.",
      "He continued: \"After my wife passed, I was stuck in the house a lot. I moved house, into the country, next door to my son - but it's not good enough just to sit watching TV, so I decided to travel. I went to Saudi [Arabia], Hong Kong and Bahrain.",
      "\"Occupy yourself. Dealing with the dementia group has been good for me. It's something that I enjoy.\"",
      "Ferguson spent 26 incredible years at Old Trafford, turning them into the most successful team in English football. In total he won 38 major honours and is still a regular at United's matches to this day.",
      "In 2024, Ferguson first revealed his fears over dementia when he said: \"Generally my memory is quite good - pray the lord, touch wood it’ll stay that way.\"",

      "It's Groundhog Day for Ruben Amorim, whose Manchester United side have continued in the poor vein of form they ended last season, despite splashing out £230million on new players this summer.",
      "It was a busy summer in terms of incomings and outgoings for the Premier League side, who welcomed the likes of Bryan Mbeumo, Matheus Cunha, Benjamin Sesko and Senne Lammens to Old Trafford. Among the several outgoings from United was Marcus Rashford who joined Barcelona on loan for the rest of the season.",
      "The Englishman has been subject to praise since his move which could see the 40-year-old question his decision to allow a player who scored 138 goals for the club to leave. Paul Scholes has also made his opinion clear on Amorim's decision to retain the services of some players at the club.",
      "Rashford has been described as \"incredible\" by Barcelona boss Hansi Flick, despite Ruben Amorim axing him from his Manchester United plans.",
      "The England star last played for his boyhood club in December 2024 before he was removed from the squad later that month to play Manchester City alongside Alejandro Garnacho.",
      "Rashford, 27, left United a month later to join Aston Villa on loan for the rest of the season, where he returned to form. However, upon his return to Old Trafford this summer, he was one of five players told by Amorim to find new clubs.",
      "A move to the Spanish giants came to fruition for Rashford, who is spending the season on loan at Barcelona. Flick recently said of the striker: \"I've been following Marcus Rashford since his early days at Manchester United and I've always thought he's incredible. What I've seen these past few weeks is very good.\"",
      "With Amorim having had pushed for Rashford's exit, the Portuguese boss also pulled the trigger on five departures, via a permanent sale or loan with Andre Onana, Jadon Sancho, Antony, Rasmus Hojlund and Alejandro Garnacho all departing.",
      "However, two players that stayed have come under fire by Paul Scholes who aimed his wrath at Harry Maguire and Luke Shaw remaining Manchester United players.",
      "Maguire, 32, has only played 41 minutes of football in the Premier League this season while Shaw, 30, has started every game as Scholes lamented their lack of physicality and insisted they are not up to the level of their competitors.",
      "In an exclusive interview with SPORTbible, he said: \"I don't think the system was the problem against Manchester City. It's more the personnel. United lack real athletes,\" he said before singling out Harry Maguire and Luke Shaw. \"In the Premier League, you almost have to be like a machine to survive, and we've got people like Harry Maguire and Luke Shaw.",
      "\"They are not at the level. In 85 to 90 percent of games, they will probably cope with people, but when you come to the bigger games, against City, Liverpool and Arsenal, they are going to fall short.\"",
      "With 29 injuries to Shaw's name since joining United in 2014, according to Transfermarkt, Scholes questioned just how damage the constant injuries have done to his body. \"You think of the injuries Shaw has had.",
      "\"He must have the body of a 40-year-old man because he’s had that many injuries and missed that much football. If he’d stayed fit, he could’ve been the best left-back in the world. Now, he’s playing left-sided centre-half. He really shouldn’t be at the club anymore.",
      "\"He should have left along with Harry Maguire in the summer. United should have brought in one or two new centre-halves.\" Maguire looks set to play a bit-part role for United this season as Scholes said his former club missed out on banking tens of millions of pounds by not selling him.",
      "\"Maguire has had so much stick, it’s hard to be tough on him because he came back from it,\" he explained. \"But I think they had a chance this summer to sell. They renewed his one-year option. I just didn’t understand that.",
      "\"It was a great chance for him to leave. They might have got £20 or £30 million for him. It was the ideal time. Maybe because he’s good in the dressing room, or good around the place, but football-wise, it’s just not right.\"",

The 27-year-old heaped praise on his new manager Hansi Flick as his double secured Barcelona's 2-1 Champions League triumph over Newcastle United.",
      "The England forward opened his account for the La Liga champions with a performance that underlined his class. Rashford departed United on loan during the summer transfer window after falling out of favour under Ruben Amorim.",
      "He demonstrated glimpses of his ability during his temporary stint at Aston Villa last term, which earned him a return to the Three Lions squad, before securing his switch to the Spanish title-holders this summer. Rashford's brace sank the Magpies as he virtually single-handedly guided Barcelona to victory, initially breaking the deadlock with a well-taken header.",
      "He grabbed the spotlight with a spectacular long-distance strike that doubled Flick's side's advantage. The United academy product lavished praise on the ex-Bayern Munich boss, months after Amorim outlined why he couldn't secure his place back in the Portuguese manager's thinking at Old Trafford.",
      "\"He's [Hansi Flick] is a top man, top coach and he'll be delighted with not just the three points but the way we won,\" Rashford declared after the final whistle.",
      "\"Most goal kicks, they're pressing so high, we still tried to play out from the back, it doesn't work all the time but we looked a positive team and with the quality we have, we can always make things happen.\"",
      "In February, the ex-Sporting CP manager Amorrim admitted to a clash of football philosophies with Rashford, which ultimately led to his move to Villa.",
      "\"I couldn't get Marcus to see the way you're supposed to play football and to train the way I see it,\" Amorim confessed. \"Sometimes you have one player that is really good with one coach, and the same player with another coach is different.",
      "\"I wish the best to Rashford and to [Villa manager] Unai Emery, and they can connect because he's a very good player.\"",
      "Rashford played a pivotal role in Barcelona's victorious start to their League Phase, as they aim to surpass last season's semi-final finish. The forward is keen to help them achieve just that.",
      "\"Honestly, it's an amazing experience. I've always been a huge admirer of Barcelona, people my age have watched them from when we was younger, amazing football, amazing players and we want to win as much as possible.",
      "\"100 percent, I'm full of excitement. I'm determined, motivated and the quality in the team it's refreshing. The team is so young, they play with such confidence and understanding of the game, here isn't an easy place to come. I've won here a few times where we've not played the way we wanted to play, we gave a good account of ourselves and got the three points.",
      "\"It's to win it, nothing else is on our minds. We know how tough the competition is, last year they almost got there but this year it's about going one step more.\"",

      "He netted two stunning goals, the first being a precise header from a Jules Kounde cross, leaving Newcastle's goalkeeper Nick Pope helpless. While Rashford wasn't particularly known for his aerial prowess at Old Trafford, his second goal was a reminder of why he was considered one of England's most promising talents.",
      "Dodging a challenge from a Newcastle defender, he unleashed a 25-yard strike that spectacularly found its way into the far corner off the post.",
      "The celebrations following each goal were markedly different. After his first goal - his first in the competition since October 2021 - Rashford was a picture of pure joy.",
      "However, after his sensational second, Rashford jogged over to the corner flag and placed his right index finger to his head - a celebration familiar to most United fans and synonymous with the England international.",
      "Given the nature of his celebration, it could have been a pointed message to Amorim, who had sidelined him from the United first team for nearly a year. The Portuguese manager had expressed dissatisfaction with Rashford's training attitude and excluded him from his plans, before shipping him out on loan to Aston Villa last January.",
      "Amorim relegated Rashford to the infamous 'Bomb Squad' this summer, where he stayed until Barcelona came calling for a loan deal. He had been finding his feet with the La Liga side, up until last weekend.",
      "In Barcelona's 6-0 thrashing of Valencia, Rashford provided an impressive assist, delivering a pinpoint, in-swinging pass to Raphinha. Barcelona boss Hansi Flick rewarded him with a starting spot against Newcastle and it's fair to say Rashford seized his chance.",
      "The German manager replaced him with Dani Olmo in the 82nd minute after a brilliant night's work. The only downside for Rashford is that he has set a high standard for a fanbase accustomed to watching top-tier wingers.",
      "Most importantly for Rashford, his two-goal performance was witnessed by England manager Thomas Tuchel, who was present at St. James' Park.",

Disappointed City supporters serenaded him off by singing his song; 'Oh Kevin De Bruyne' to the tune of Seven Nation Army by the White Stripes. As he took his seat on Napoli's bench, football fans in their numbers came out to offer their thoughts.",

Understandably, Beckham was thrilled to see his product being sold, as he posted an Instagram snap of himself standing by a packed shelf and wrote: \"Swipe to see how excited I am seeing @beeupsnacks in @target\".",
      "Announcing the new venture earlier this year, the former Three Lions captain explained: \"My love of beekeeping and making my own honey began as a hobby and quickly grew into a passion. I built the hives with my sons, learned how to care for the bees, and mastered the art of harvesting one of nature's most powerful superfoods.",
      "\"As a father and former athlete, it's always been important to me to give my kids wholesome alternatives to sweets. That's why I created BEEUP-a new snack brand rooted in honey, my love for family, and active living.",
      "\"Whether it's early mornings, after-school sports, or weekend adventures, BEEUP delivers better energy-one delicious bite at a time. This time-tested superfood tastes delicious and provides the energy kids need - perfect for fueling up before practice, lessons, or games.\"",
      "Beckham discussed his newfound passion for beekeeping while being filmed for the Netflix documentary series about his life, which launched in 2023. The opening sequence of the programme showed him collecting honey from a beehive into at his lavish Cotswolds estate, while his wife Victoria watched on and playfully suggested he should market the honey under the brand name 'DB Sticky Stuff'.",
      "The football legend is no stranger to commercial enterprises, having built up an enormous personal fortune over the years with a string of major ventures beyond the football pitch supplementing the wealth he amassed during his playing career. The 2025 Sunday Times Rich List, published earlier this year, revealed that Beckham and former Spice Girl Victoria boast an eye-watering combined fortune of £500 million.",
      "Business Insider reports that the ex-United and Real Madrid icon had amassed an incredible $800 million (£587 million) by the time he retired from professional football 12 years ago. He once held the title of the world's highest-paid footballer, while the five-year deal he penned with LA Galaxy in 2008 would be valued at approximately £190 million in today's money.",
      "However, Beckham has also significantly boosted his personal wealth through a series of profitable sponsorships and business deals, having collaborated with major brands such as Emporio Armani, Gillette, PepsiCo, H&M, Breitling and Adidas over the years. He's also launched his own line of fragrances, while he's lent his name to everything from sunglasses to video games.",
      "The Netflix documentary is thought to have netted the former footballer around £20 million alone, while he pulled in an impressive £72.6 million in 2023 thanks to his sponsorships and production company. He also inked a 10-year deal to become an ambassador for Qatar, which reportedly saw him pocket around £125 million from the country.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "The crowning glory of Brand Beckham, however, is his Major League Soccer team Inter Miami. When Beckham negotiated his move to LA Galaxy nearly two decades ago, he was offered the option to purchase an expansion team in any market for just $25 million. Today, with the likes of Lionel Messi and Luis Suarez on its roster, the franchise is now believed to be worth over $1 billion, doubling in value between 2023 and 2024.",
      "As well as raking in astronomical sums from his various ventures, Beckham is no stranger to spending big, with over a dozen properties making up his remarkable portfolio, which is estimated to be worth around £70 million. That includes a luxury penthouse in Miami, purchased for £17.5 million, as well as a London townhouse valued at around £30 million.",
      "The ex-footballer also boasts a 130-foot superyacht that reportedly cost him a whopping £16 million, while his impressive car collection is estimated to be worth over £2 million.",

      "Peter Schmeichel has slammed Manchester United for signing Senne Lammens ahead of Emi Martinez or Gianluigi Donnarumma this summer. United paid £18.2million for the Royal Antwerp goalkeeper in the summer transfer window after Ruben Amorim decided to replace Andre Onana.",
      "Onana has been shipped out on loan to Trabzonspor this season, with Lammens competing with Altay Bayindir for a place in the starting XI. Bayindir kept his place in the starting XI for the Manchester Derby on Sunday, but the 3-0 defeat means Lammens could make his debut against Chelsea this weekend.",
      "Lammens is 23 years old and has only ever played in Belgium, meaning the step up at United will be a big one. Schmeichel spent eight years at United and is one of the club’s best-ever goalkeepers. He isn’t convinced at all by United’s decision, having been unaware of Lammens before he arrived.",
      "“As for Lammens, I’ll be honest, I’d never heard of him until the link came up,” Schmeichel told The Sun. “I know his stats are excellent across the top 10 European leagues. But that was with Antwerp in Belgium, in a team that finished fifth.",
      "“He saved four out of eight penalties, but recruitment based purely on stats is risky. Stats don’t show how you react after a mistake, or how you cope with the pressure of Manchester United. That pressure is unlike anywhere else in football.\"",
      "Lammens has never been called up to the senior Belgium squad and Schmeichel feels United would have been better off paying more for a more established player. They considered signing Martinez from Aston Villa and Donnarumma before he left Paris Saint-Germain for rivals Manchester City.",
      "“Lammens could turn out to be the best signing ever – but right now, it feels like a hopeful one, and that’s not what United need at this moment in time,” Schmeichel added. “If we’d signed him alongside Martinez, that would have made perfect sense: a proven World Cup winner as number one, with a talented young keeper developing behind him. But instead, we’re left asking who’s going to be number one.”",
      "United splashed £47m to sign Onana from Inter Milan two summers ago, but were unwilling to pay the £40m Villa quoted for Martinez, or the significant wages Donnarumma demanded. The position has been a long-term problem for Amorim, but United opted to spend over £200m on attacking additions Bryan Mbeumo, Matheus Cunha and Benjamin Sesko instead.",
      "“We should have signed Emi Martinez. In fact, we should have gone for Gianluigi Donnarumma when we had the chance,” Schmeichel said. “With Martinez, everything was lined up and that felt like really good news, because he’s exactly the kind of goalkeeper Manchester United should have.”",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Jose Mourinho is the new Benfica manager, with his latest break from the game lasting less than a month. The former Chelsea, Manchester United and Real Madrid boss was sacked by Fenerbahce at the end of August after just over a year in charge.",
      "His swift exit came two days after the Turkish club were eliminated from the Champions League play-offs…by his new employers Benfica, who have hired him on a deal until June 2027. Mourinho’s side were beaten by former Premier League manager Bruno Lage, but he was also dismissed this week following a mixed start to the new season.",
      "‘The Special One’, started his managerial career with Benfica in 2000 but lasted less than a season after falling out with the club’s president. Now 62, Mourinho returns to Benfica and is expected to take his first training session on Thursday.",
      "Speaking before his appointment was made official, Mourinho revealed he had no hesitation in going back to his former club. He said: “What I can confirm is that, before I caught the plane, Benfica asked me if I was interested in coaching them.",
      "“I said yes. I said I was abroad and that when I returned to Portugal I would have all the interest in talking with them. My nature is wanting to coach. I told myself that I wanted to balance myself emotionally.",
      "\"I didn’t want to say yes to the wrong club, just because I am a workaholic. When asked if I wanted to coach Benfica, I did not think twice. It interests me.”",
      "Manchester United manager Ruben Amorim's name had also come up in the wake of Lage's sacking, with his future at Old Trafford uncertain. The former Sporting manager has endured a dismal first year in England and has picked up just one win from United's opening four Premier League games.",
      "The United hierarchy insist they are continuing to back the manager, although another meeting is planned in three games' time, during the next international break.",
      "Capitalising on the speculation, Norohna Lopes - who is hoping to become Benfica's president - was asked about the possibility of landing the Red Devils boss.",
      "He said: \"Ruben Amorim? He's a great coach, he has a contract with Manchester United. I won't comment on that. Of course I like him. He's a great coach and a Benfica fan. I don't have a contract for Ruben to sign.\"",
      "Mourinho's return to Benfica also ends speculation over a move back to the English top flight. He has already had two spells with Chelsea, winning the Premier League three times, as well as managing Manchester United and Tottenham.",
      "He had previously suggested he would be open to the idea of taking over a club not featuring in European competition, after several rows with UEFA.",
      "\"I think the best thing I have to do is, when I leave Fenerbahce, I go to a club that does not play UEFA competitions,\" Mourinho said. \"If any club in England from the bottom of the table needs a coach in two years, I am ready to go.\"",

      "Ruben Amorim is facing a crucial run of games as he tries to save his job as Manchester United manager. Amorim is under huge pressure following United’s 3-0 defeat by Manchester City on Sunday which worsened his miserable record with the club.",
      "Defeat confirmed United’s worst start to a season since 1992/93 and meant Amorim’s record stands at eight wins from 31 Premier League matches since he arrived in November. The Portuguese boss knows such form cannot continue, with his side 14th with four points from four games.",
      "United have won just once this season, and even that game needed a late Bruno Fernandes penalty to beat Burnley. Their issues were blatantly obvious in their defeat on penalties by Grimsby in the Carabao Cup and Amorim needs immediate improvement, starting against Chelsea at Old Trafford on Saturday evening. Here are five things Amorim needs to get right in order to keep his job.",
      "The goalkeeping department has been a mess at United for some time. Andre Onana is gone, shipped off on loan to Trabzonspor, but that hasn’t solved the problem. Altay Bayindir has played all four Premier League games this season, but simply doesn’t look up to the level required.",
      "Amorim opted against throwing £18.2million signing Senne Lammens into the firing line for the derby on the weekend, but surely he can’t stick by Bayindir. United opted for Lammens over Aston Villa's Emi Martinez and Gianluigi Donnarumma, who went to City instead, so they clearly believe in the 23-year-old Belgian. Amorim can’t delay the decision any longer; talk of Lammens getting used to the different balls in England is laughable.",
      "Everyone knows it. There is no longer any originality in pointing out that United’s midfield does not function properly. Amorim has stuck steadfastly to his 3-4-3 formation, which sees Fernandes partner either Casemiro or Manuel Ugarte in a two-man midfield. It doesn’t work.",
      "Fernandes is United’s best and most creative player. He doesn’t want to be back defending deep and he is at his best playing further forward with creative licence. Casemiro, meanwhile, now lacks the mobility to get around the pitch and cover the gaps and Ugarte has also been unconvincing. Amorim doesn’t trust Kobbie Mainoo to play as a defensively-minded midfield, but something needs to change.",
      "The midfield issue stems from Amorim’s reluctance to adapt. He plays the same system regardless of the opponent. There was patience initially upon his arrival, with fans knowing it would take time for the players to get used to his ideas, but they are now fed up with it not working.",
      "“You talk about his philosophy, his style of play, the way he wants to play,” United legend Paul Scholes pointed out on The Good the Bad and the Football podcast this week. “There’s so many clever coaches in England and around the world, they work it out quite easily. They know exactly how United are going to play every week.",
      "“When the team sheet comes through an hour before the game you always wonder how your opponents are going to play, five at the back, four at the back? With Amorim, you know, everybody knows. It’s easy to play against and easy to work out as the coaches are that clever. Anyone in the Premier League can beat us.”",
      "On the face of it, Benjamin Sesko has endured a miserable start to life at United following a £73.7m move from RB Leipzig. He has made five appearances without scoring – a stark contrast to the likes of Hugo Ekitike at Liverpool and Viktor Gyokeres at Arsenal, who he will obviously be compared to this season.",
      "Sesko got 21 goals for Leipzig last season, so has the ability to perform at this level, but he needs service. Bryan Mbeumo has been the best of the new arrivals, but hasn’t linked up well with the Slovenian centre-forward.",
      "Alan Shearer and Gary Lineker know a few things about strikers and believe he is being starved of supply. “He must be thinking; 'Any danger? Any chance of giving me something here'? Something to go after, some crosses,” Shearer said on The Rest Is Football podcast. Speaking about the derby, Lineker added: “He's making darting runs, but I felt for him a little bit. It's tough when you're not getting any service.\"",
      "Fernandes has constantly been forced to defend himself from pundits who believe he isn’t captain material. He did so once again this week, explaining his passionate personality while saying he won’t change. Amorim isn’t about to strip his best player of the captaincy, but he could do with him pulling his team-mates together.",
      "United don’t look like a team that are all pulling in the same direction and Fernandes throwing his arms in the air, arguing with the referee and generally wearing his heart on his sleeve doesn’t help. What United need is somebody who can inspire their team-mates and get them all singing off the same hymn sheet.",
      "Despite not playing in Europe this season, there isn’t any time for a team-building exercise, so muddy obstacle courses and paintballing are out, but Amorim could perhaps do with a clear-the-air team meeting.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Jamie O'Hara has doubled down on his calls for Ole Gunnar Solskjaer to make a sensational return to Manchester United and replace Ruben Amorim.",
      "The Norwegian coach is currently out of work following his dismissal from Besiktas at the end of last month after they failed to qualify for the league phase of the Conference League, losing against Lausanne-Sport - another club under the Ineos umbrella like United - in the play-offs. His team managed just a 1-1 draw in Switzerland before suffering a damaging 1-0 defeat on home soil in Istanbul seven days later.",
      "It marked Solskjaer's maiden managerial stint since United showed him the door in November 2021. The ex-Red Devils striker had stepped away from the dugout for over three years before taking the reins at Besiktas, overseeing merely 29 fixtures during his brief Turkish adventure.",
      "\"He can come in, he can be a stopgap manager, interim manager, get players back onside.\" O'Hara elaborated: \"I believe that Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, if you get him back in, go back to the formation that they were playing before, get the players back onside, give them a bit of freedom, and I think they can maybe just calm everything down.\"",
      "Several weeks on, O'Hara has reinforced that position. \"I can't believe Ruben Amorim is still in charge,\" he declared on talkSPORT this week.",
      "\"When are they going to let it go? When are they going to just... do what Sheffield United have done, just swallow their pride [and say] 'we got this wrong?'\" Sheffield United have recently made a managerial U-turn, with Chris Wilder stepping in to replace Ruben Selles, just three months after the latter's mutual agreement to depart from the Championship club.",
      "O'Hara concluded: \"Get Ole back in. They can't carry on doing this. They'll go down. They'll be playing Rotherham [United] next season.",

      "Alejandro Garnacho can expect a hostile reception this weekend when he returns to Manchester United for the first time since leaving for Chelsea.",
      "Garnacho is the first member of Ruben Amorim's 'bomb squad' to return to Old Trafford, less than three weeks after his acrimonious exit. The winger, along with fellow outcasts Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho, Antony and Tyrrell Malacia, was exiled by Amorim after asking to leave.",
      "For Amroim and United's hierarchy, Garnacho's talent and potential was outweighed by his ego and petulance, so they decided to cut their losses and cash in on the 21-year-old.",
      "On Saturday, Garnacho will be Public Enemy No.1 when he walks out of the tunnel at the Theatre of Dreams, a stadium where he was once lauded but where he is now seen as a traitor.",
      "Such was his standing among the loyal match-going United fans, they even adapted one of their most famous stadium chants – 'Viva Ronaldo' – a homage to Cristiano Ronaldo, replacing his name with that of Garnacho.",
      "But after Garnacho's messy departure from United, when he threw his toys out of the pram and Amorim under the bus after being benched for last season's Europa League final defeat to Tottenham, he is now reviled, rather than revered.",
      "Whether Chelsea boss Enzo Maresca can succeed where Amorim failed and unlock Garnacho's hue potential, as well as instilling in him some discipline and humility, only time will tell, but United are not losing any sleep over allowing him to join a Premier League rival.",
      "Garnacho's demise at United began shortly after Amorim took charge, when he was axed from the squad for the Manchester derby last December, along with Rashford, after his boss felt he had failed to listen to instructions when coming on in a Europa League game four days earlier.",
      "Although Garnacho was then handed a reprieve, unlike Rashford, and won back his place in the United line-up, his card was marked with Amorim, with those who work closely with the squad on a daily basis claiming the Argentina international was never able to regain the trust of his manager.",
      "Garnacho's inflammatory public outburst about his omission from the Europa League final starting line-up was the final straw for Amorim, who left him out of the squad for United's final game of last season, a 2-0 home win over Aston Villa.",
      "That was the first major step in offloading a player deemed too troublesome and high maintenance to work with going forward. Concrete evidence of that came over the summer, when Garnacho posted on social media a picture of himself wearing a Villa shirt with Rashford's name and No.9 on the back.",
      "It was considered a provocative gesture and a dig at both Amorim and United, rather than a genuine show of solidarity to Rashford, who spent the second half of last season on loan at Villa.",
      "Both Garnacho and Rashford were at odds with United and the former's actions served only to strengthen the view within the club that he had to go, irrespective of his talent and potential.",
      "United fans generally do not like seeing talented academy players leave before they have had a chance to fulfil their potential, given the club's rich history is built on giving youth a chance, going back to the Busby Babes.",
      "But talent alone is not enough to succeed at United, as Garnacho found out. You need discipline, a strong work ethic and a mentality that puts the team above your own interests, qualities he failed to grasp or show in his five years at United.",
      "That is why there will be no love lost between him and 70,000 United fand when he walks out at Old Trafford on Saturday evening.",

      "Many Manchester United fans will have cringed when they read Alejandro Garnacho's first words after signing for Chelsea.",
      "\"I can't wait to get started. I watched the Club World Cup, and to join the world champions is special - we're the best team in the world,\" said Garnacho.",
      "Garnacho trained alone at Carrington throughout the summer after a breakdown in his relationship with Ruben Amorim at the end of last season. He expressed his desire to leave, and a £40million deal was finally agreed with Chelsea in the final week of the transfer window.",
      "That felt like a low fee for a player of Garnacho's talent, but Chelsea initially entered discussions by offering £25m and United's bargaining power was damaged by the world knowing he needed to leave.",
      "Regardless, Garnacho became United's fourth-highest sale in history, behind Cristiano Ronaldo, Romelu Lukaku and Angel Di Maria.",
      "United included a 10 per cent sell-on fee in the deal and Garnacho signed a lucrative seven-year contract at Stamford Bridge. United said Garnacho left for London with their best wishes, but that sentiment is not shared by some supporters after an eventful final six months at the club.",
      "There were discipline issues with Garnacho during Erik ten Hag's reign, but the beginning of the end of his United career was in December when he was dropped for the Manchester derby.",
      "Speaking before that game, Ruben Amorim confirmed Garnacho and Marcus Rashford had been dropped due to selection reasons. They were available, but Amorim had seen something he did not like.",
      "Garnacho was reintegrated into the squad, while Rashford was sent on loan to Aston Villa. Garnacho sought to make amends with Amorim and did the right things to be involved again.",
      "However, cracks reappeared against Ipswich Town at the end of February when Garnacho stormed down the tunnel at Old Trafford after being sacrificed following a red card to Patrick Dorgu.",
      "Garnacho posted a photo of himself on an Instagram Story to tell the world he wasn't happy. Amorim subsequently clarified that he had apologised and offered to pay for a team dinner.",
      "\"He is a young kid that will learn,” said Amorim, but Garnacho didn't learn quickly enough because he undermined his manager again following the Europa League final defeat to Tottenham.",
      "Garnacho was introduced in the final in Bilbao with 20 minutes remaining. And earlier in the day, he uploaded a photo of himself scoring in last season's FA Cup final on Instagram.",
      "It appeared to suggest he'd been omitted from the starting XI, and Garnacho was confirmed to be on the bench at the Estadio de San Mames when the team news was revealed.",
      "Garnacho told reporters: \"Up until the final I played every round helping the team, and today I play 20 minutes, I don't know. The final will influence [his decision to stay at United].\"",
      "His younger brother, Roberto Garnacho, added fuel to the fire when he posted on social media: \"Working as no one else, helping every round, coming from two goals last two finals, just to be on the pitch for 19 mins and get thrown under the bus. Wowe, hahahaha.\"",
      "The irony is that club sources who worked with Garnacho at Carrington insisted he couldn't be further from the image that was eventually portrayed.",
      "Garnacho was described as a quiet, almost shy, member of the dressing room. He was said to be polite and humble, which probably contradicts the image some fans now have of him.",
      "But Garnacho is responsible for United fans' perception, and it will be fascinating to see how the youngster is welcomed when he returns to Old Trafford with Chelsea on Saturday evening.",
      "Garnacho is an academy graduate. He was talismanic during the special FA Youth Cup campaign in 2021/22 and produced some brilliant moments for the first team, including the opening goal against Manchester City in the FA Cup final in 2024, but the circumstances around his exit haven't sat right with fans.",
      "@creedthered: \"For someone who was given a long leash at Utd, he’s shown that he doesn’t deserve it. I remember Ten Hag, Bruno and other senior members talking about how he needed to change his attitude when he wasn’t a first regular. And for a second it looked like he did, but old habits die hard.\"",
      "@fcmuAhmed: \"Great talent and while he’s inconsistent, I believe the level of expectations is way too high for him, even though the chaos at United is well documented. Constant change of managers is never helpful, especially for young players. He’d have performed so much better at a well-managed team.\"",
      "@chiragcp1982: \"Shame young talent had to leave, but think his attitude and ego had got too big to the stage where he thought he was the best player at the club. Some of his performances last season were awful. Poor finishing, real lack of creativity from wide areas or when he played at 10.\"",
      "@AmarVijh999: \"Happy that he left as he didn’t represent the club in the right way. Speaking after a loss and making it about you is selfish, and that selfishness was seen more and more over his three years. He’s more interested in modelling than football. I will never see him as an academy player.\"",
      "@TheUnitedLad541: \"He is exactly what is wrong with the post-Fergie club. Good riddance.\"",
      "Garnacho was named on the bench for Chelsea's defeat to Bayern Munich earlier in the week. He is yet to start a game for Chelsea and might be limited to a bench role again at Old Trafford on Saturday.",
      "We will hear what United fans think about Garnacho if he makes an appearance.",

      "United have had a free mid-week after failing to qualify for any UEFA competition last term and following their League Cup second round exit to Grimsby Town. However, there is no shortage of focus on them following their 3-0 defeat to Manchester City in the derby.",
      "Even though the summer window has closed, transfer talk has remained with Ruben Neves emerging as the latest midfielder of interest. Elliot Anderson, Carlos Baleba and Adam Wharton have also been linked with moves to Old Trafford.",
      "We will cover all the latest transfer news and rumours, plus any further developments on Amorim's future and other more general club updates with our live blog below.",
      "The United boss is due to face the media shortly for his pre-match press conference ahead of the game against Chelsea.",
      "He is due to speak from 1.30pm, we will of course, bring you the biggest lines here, but you can catch what he says via our live blog right here.",
      "Hello United fans, and good afternoon.",
      "My name is Amie and I will be with you for the next couple of hours bringing you the latest news from Old Trafford as and when it happens.",
      "First, here's a look at some of the next you may have missed from so far today:",

      "'A ghost' - Italian press react to Rasmus Hojlund Champions League display after Man United exit",
      "Chelsea boss gives verdict on Ruben Amorim pressure at Manchester United - 'No doubt'",
      "Former Manchester United midfielder Bryan Robson has urged Ruben Amorim to start Amad Diallo, Bryan Mbeumo and Kobbie Mainoo against Chelsea on Saturday.",
      "He told OLBG: \"Well, it's whether Mason Mount's going to be fit because Mason tweaked his hamstring as well but he was flying at the start of the season. The work rate he was putting in was really good. He held up the ball and passed the ball well. It was disappointing to lose him as well.",
      "\"I think Amad and Bryan will both start against Chelsea. You’ve got to start with those two as the wide players, especially with it being a home game.",
      "\"I'd like to see Bruno get more of a free role, maybe bring Mainoo and Casemiro back into the team and get them two in the midfield area and hopefully we don't get overrun in midfield then.\"",
      "Chelsea head coach Enzo Maresca has praised Ruben Amorim ahead of Saturday's crunch clash against Manchester United.",
      "Speaking in his pre-match press conference, Maresca said: \"The only thing I can say is that I really appreciate Ruben. I've watched Ruben games since he was in Sporting. He's a magnificent manager.",
      "\"Like all the managers, when you start a new project sometimes you can struggle a little bit more or a little bit less but at the end you're going to struggle. I don't have any doubt that he's a fantastic manager.\"",
      "Joshua Zirkzee could be on his way out of Manchester United with Juventus seen as a potential destination, according to TEAMTalk.",
      "As United continue to make changes to their squad, Zirkzee could be the next on the chopping block with the Reds deploying a one-in one-out policy.",
      "Zirkzee has played just 77 minutes in all competitions for United this season and is behind Benjamin Sesko in the pecking order at Old Trafford.",
      "According to Fabrizio Romano, Juventus forward Dusan Vlahovic was offered to Manchester United before they secured the deal for Benjamin Sesko during the summer transfer window.",
      "The Reds decided against making a move for Vlahovic, who scored a brace in Juve's thrilling 4-4 draw at home to Borussia Dortmund on Tuesday. They instead brought in Sesko for £73million from Leipzig.",
      "Alan Shearer has delivered a new verdict on Ruben Amorim's future and claimed the Manchester United head coach is under huge pressure to keep his job, ahead of Saturday's visit of Chelsea.",
      "Shearer told Betfair: \"It was men against boys last weekend at the Etihad. They were miles apart in terms of ability, system, attitude and whatever else you want to name despite what Man United have spent in the summer. I don't think they can afford to be beaten like that again this weekend. If they were then you'd have to fear for what's going to happen going forward for the manager.",
      "\"Something must improve rapidly. Man United can't be lingering in 14th/15th/16th in the Premier League. There hasn't been an improvement at all up to now and that can't continue with what they spent. There has to be something that gets them going and if that doesn't happen quickly then everyone knows the rules when it comes to football management.",
      "\"It's on both the manager and players but I do think there's a lot in the system and despite what the manager says, he's not going to change his ways, he'll stick to that system. He's either going to die on his sword or get the success that he needs. At the minute it looks really negative, and I don't think a lot of those players are suited to the system.",
      "\"Amorim knows, he believes, and he will either keep or lose his job. It's a really interesting weekend and one where he can't take another beating like they did last weekend.\"",
      "According to TEAMTalk, Manchester United midfielder Kobbie Mainoo is eager for consistent first-team game time with next summer's World Cup looming.",
      "It's claimed that Manchester City have joined the race for the midfielder, with Pep Guardiola keen to lure him to the Etihad Stadium in January.",
      "Guardiola is said to rate Mainoo highly, viewing him as a potential heir to Bernardo Silva in midfield.",
      "Under pressure Manchester United head coach Ruben Amorim will speak to the media at 1:15pm this afternoon, ahead of this weekend's game against Chelsea at Old Trafford.",
      "The Reds face Enzo Maresca's Blues looking to record a much-needed win following last Sunday's damning 3-0 defeat at Manchester City.",
      "Saudi Pro League side Al-Nassr remain interested in signing Manchester United midfielder Casemiro and are determined to reunite him with former teammate Cristiano Ronaldo.",
      "According to Spanish outlet Mundo Deportivo, Al-Nassr are prepared to do what it takes to sign him, and the player is thought to be tempted by lucrative offers from the Saudi club.",
      "Manchester United are looking to sign Real Madrid midfielder Federico Valverde next summer and are prepared to submit a stunning £86million offer, according to Spanish outlet Fichajes.",
      "It's added that the Reds are willing to break the bank to get a deal done as Ruben Amorim tries to strengthen his midfield. Valverde has a contract with Los Blancos until 2029, and the club is under no pressure to sell him.",
      "Rasmus Hojlund, Joshua Zirkzee and Alejandro Garnacho were among the current and former Manchester United players to support Marcus Rashford after he scored a brace for Barcelona during their 2-1 win at Newcastle United in the Champions League on Thursday.",
      "Rashford's first came in the 58th minute as he connected with Jules Kounde's cross before guiding a well placed header into the bottom corner. Shortly after, the England international netted his second of the night, doubling his side's advantage with a stunning strike from the edge of the box.",
      "Reacting post-match, Rashford took to Instagram and issued a simple seven-word message following his match-winning performance at St James' Park. The 27-year-old: said: \"Great way to kick off the @championsleague [sparkles emoji, football emoji, flexed bicep emoji, backhand index finger pointing right emoji, smiling face emoji].\"",
      "A post shared by MR (@marcusrashford)",
      "Hello and welcome to our dedicated Manchester United blog.",
      "Pressure has increased on Amorim following a 3-0 defeat against Manchester City on Sunday, with just one win from United's opening four top-flight fixtures.",
      "The Portuguese head coach is now faced with a tough clash against Chelsea, who have made an unbeaten start in the league, at Old Trafford on Saturday evening.",
      "A busy day for Manchester United fans and those close to the club has come to an end.",
      "As well as transfer links to the likes of Ruben Neves, Adam Wharton and many more, it was also a busy night to be a former United player. Scott McTominay and Rasmus Hojlund will want to move on from this evening after losing 2-0 away to Manchester City with Napoli.",
      "However, the talking point of the evening is certainly Marcus Rashford's incredible display for Barcelona against Newcastle United. Do not be surprised if Ruben Amorim is asked about the United academy prospect he banished to the so-called 'Bomb Squad'.",
      "Rasmus Hojlund endured a difficult Champions League debut for Napoli as his side slipped to a defeat to Manchester City.",
      "The Manchester United loanee was back in the city with the Serie A winners. It was a difficult evening from start to finish for the £72million forward, as Antonio Conte's side went down to ten-men after Giovanni Di Lorenzo was red carded after being deemed to have prevented a goalscoring opportunity by hauling down Erling Haaland.",
      "Kevin De Bruyne was sacrificed to bring on another defender in the first half, but Hojound was substituted in the 72nd minute for David Veres when the Neapolitans were trailing to goals from Haaland and Jeremy Doku.",
      "Overall, it was an evening to forget for Hojlund and Scott McTominay, who could not wield the same influence on the blue side of Manchester.",
      "Within 82 minutes of football, Marcus Rashford levelled the total goal of Manchester United's new £200million attacking trio this season.",
      "The United academy graduate was handed a place in the starting eleven for Barcelona's Champions League clash against Newcastle United. It was a huge occasion for Rashford, who has experienced a difficult start to life with the Catalans.",
      "However, he drew level with the combined goal tally of Benjamin Sesko, Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha, when he guided a fine header into the bottom corner from the penalty spot. If that goal was impressive, his second was spectacular as he found the top corner with a 25-yard rocket.",
      "His second goal of the evening extended his record for the season to two goals and one assist. It was a spectacular display for the forward who was completely frozen out by Ruben Amorim barely one month ago.",
      "On his start to life at Barcelona.",
      "\"Honestly, it's an amazing experience. I've always been a huge admirer of Barcelona, people my age have watched them from when we was younger, amazing football, amazing players and we want to win as much as possible.\"",
      "On his incredible second goal",
      "\"I've not seen it yet. It was a split second, I seen the far post, I thought I'd get a shot off, when you're going away from goal it's difficult to generate the power to keep it low, I thought try to aim high and I knew when I caught it, it would take some doing for the 'keeper to stop it.\"",
      "Peter Schmeichel ruthlessly slammed Manchester United's acquisition of Senne Lammens by saying \"I've never heard of him.\"",
      "The Red Devils bought the young Belgian from Royal Antwerp towards the end of the transfer window for £18.1million plus add-ons. At the time, United had been linked with Gianluigi Donnarumma and Emiliano Martinez, but opted for the 23-year-old.",
      "With Amorim still persisting with Altay Bayindir, despite the Turkish goalkeeper's difficult start to the season, Schmeichel has admitted he was disappointed the Red Devils did not sign a more experienced goalkeeper.",
      "Speaking to Sky Bet, he said: \"We should have signed Emi Martinez. In fact, we should have gone for Gianluigi Donnarumma when we had the chance.\"",
      "He added: \"As for Lammens, I'll be honest, I'd never heard of him until the link came up. I know his stats are excellent across the top ten European leagues. But that was with Antwerp in Belgium, in a team that finished fifth.",
      "\"Stats don't show how you react after a mistake, or how you cope with the pressure of Manchester United. That pressure is unlike anywhere else in football.\"",
      "Reports from Spain understand Chelsea are set to enter the race for Crystal Palace midfield maestro Adam Wharton.",
      "The England international has been linked with a move to Manchester United, but Wharton did not try to push for an exit from Selhurst Park. Real Madrid have also been mentioned as an admirer of the former Blackburn Rovers star, whose composure in the middle of the park has earned rave reviews.",
      "But according to Spanish outlet Fichajes, Chelsea view the midfielder as someone who can add further depth, particularly with Romeo Lavia struggling with injuries since his move from Southampton.",
      "Marcus Rashford is back in England to face Newcastle United with Barcelona.",
      "The Englishman made his first goal contribution for the La Liga giants, providing a sumptuous cross for Raphinha to tap home in their 6-0 demolition of Valencia. However, what are the terms of his deal?",
      "Agreement with Barcelona",
      "It's understood the deal with the Catalans was a season-long loan deal including a €30million (£26m) option to buy at the end of the season. Recently, there were reports saying Barcelona would have to pay a £4.3m penalty fee if they choose not to sign him permanently, but The Athletic understands this is not the case.",
      "Can he be recalled",
      "While there is no sign Amorim wants to bring Rashford back to the club, the Sun claims United would not be able to recall him even if the United boss did.",
      "With Ruben Neves being linked with a potential move to Manchester United, many fans may be wondering how he could fare.",
      "Fans may remember the sensational goals he scored for Wolverhampton Wanderers in the Premier League and the Champions League. However, the Al-Hilal midfielder has other statistics which suggests he could be exactly what Ruben Amorim needs.",
      "Here are some below:",
      "- Average non-penalty goals per 90 minutes - 0.19",
      "- Average tackles per 90 minutes - 3.21",
      "- Average passes completed per 90 minutes - 74.89",
      "- Average pass completion % 91.8%",
      "\"The talks are ongoing. There’s nothing more to say. We’ll see what happens.’",
      "Manchester United and Manchester City are understood to be tracking 14-year-old goalkeeping prospect Alfie Smith.",
      "Smith is playing four years above his age level for Birmingham City's U18s side. The Midlanders, who are co-owned by Tom Brady, are trying to tie him down to a new long-term contract.",
      "However, the Daily Mail understands the teenager, who is already 6ft 1in tall, is being looked at by United and City, as well as Arsenal and Liverpool. While United have signed Senne Lammens this summer, any potential move for Smith would of course be with an eye on the long-term future, many years away.",
      "Barcelona are considering a move for former Manchester United transfer target Dusan Vlahovic.",
      "The Juventus forward was reportedly \"offered\" to United this summer and would have had a much lower price-tag than summer signing Benjamin Sesko. Vlahovic was incredible in Juventus 4-4 draw with Borussia Dortmund in the Champions League, scoring a brace and contributing an assist.",
      "In the print edition of Italian newspaper La Gazzetta dello Sport, via TeamTalk, it's claimed United are looking at him again, except Barcelona and Atletico Madrid are to. Considering the Serbian is only 25 years old, he appears to be player who could still get even bigger.",
      "Earlier in the summer, it was said he was available for as little as £22million, a snippet of the €75million (£65.3m) plus €10m (£8.7) in add-ons United paid Leipzig for Sesko.",
      "Manchester United midfielder Casemiro is being considered by Saudi Arabian side Al-Nassr, according to reports from Spain.",
      "The Brazilian's deal expires next summer, meaning he will be available to depart the club as a free agent. Casemiro's arrival in Erik ten Hag's first transfer window has been heavily criticised, particularly with him signing a four-year deal.",
      "While he impressed in his first campaign under Ten Hag, the Real Madrid legend's dynamism has often been questioned, particularly within Ruben Amorim's 3-4-3 system. However, Spanish outlet Mundo Deportivo understands Al-Nassr, who Cristiano Ronaldo plays for, are considering a move for the 33-year-old.",
      "Manchester United are considering a move for Brentford midfielder Yehor Yarmolyuk, who is a cheaper alternative to Carlos Baleba.",
      "Midfield has emerged as a glaring weakness for Ruben Amorim's side. The Red Devils were interested in a move for Baleba, but pulled their interest not long after Brighton and Hove Albion said he could cost £100million.",
      "Reports from Ukrainian outlet Dynamo.kiev.ua claim the Red Devils have been impressed by Yarmolyuk's performances for the Bees. It also claims United are \"serious contenders\" for the 21-year-old, who may cost around £30m.",
      "Amorim has been insisting on deploying his 3-4-3 formation with Bruno Fernandes operating as one of the two defensive midfielders in his system. It has so far been exposed on multiple occasions and was painfully picked apart by City at the Etihad Stadium.",
      "Peter Schmeichel has blasted Manchester United for getting rid of Scott McTominay and Rasmus Hojlund.",
      "The former Red Devils duo are both starring for Napoli, with the latter recently scoring on his debut for the Neapolitans. Meanwhile, McTominay was named as the Serie A MVP last season, after winning the title with Antonio Conte's side.",
      "Looking back on the decisions, Schmeichel admits he cannot understand why the club parted with the duo. Speaking to Sky Bet, Schmeichel said: \"I’d say Scott McTominay and Rasmus Hojlund are the two players who should never have left.\"",
      "He added: \"The one that really pains me is Hojlund. I honestly believe he could have been a 25-goal-a-season striker for Manchester United.",
      "\"The problem wasn’t him – it was the way the team played. The system didn’t suit him. When players like [Alejandro] Garnacho or [Marcus] Rashford got the ball, they looked only to shoot. The ball into the number nine never came, even though Rasmus was making really good runs.\"",
      "When referring to Scott McTominay, he added: \"As for McTominay, I honestly can’t say anything other than: why? Why was he allowed to leave?\"",
      "Paul Scholes believes Manchester United need to part with Harry Maguire and Luke Shaw.",
      "The United legend was commenting on the Red Devils' 3-0 defeat to Manchester City the previous weekend. Shaw started as Ruben Amorim's left-wing-back, while Maguire came on from the bench against Pep Guardiola's side.",
      "For City's first goal, Jeremy Doku got the better of the ex-Southampton defender, who then failed to track Phil Foden's run before the England international headed in the opener. Speaking to Sportbible, Scholes said: \"I don't think the system was the problem against Manchester City.",
      "\"It's more the personnel. United lack real athletes. In the Premier League, you almost have to be like a machine to survive, and we've got people like Harry Maguire and Luke Shaw.",
      "\"They are not at the level. In 85 to 90 percent of games, they will probably cope with people.",
      "\"But when you come to the bigger games, against City, Liverpool and Arsenal, they are going to fall short.\"",
      "Conor Gallagher is one of many midfielders Manchester United were interested in during the summer transfer window with a late approach made for the former Chelsea man.",
      "TBR Football have now stated he is becoming irate regarding his predicament at Atletico Madrid with just two starts out of a possible five made. Their report did state he is happy, though.",
      "This comes following updates from journalist Graeme Bailey over Gallagher possibly moving elsewhere in January.",
      "As with many players at this moment in time, the World Cup is an added complication or worry.",
      "Gallagher is one of those players who, if playing regularly, at his best, would be firmly in contention for his national side, so that issue can’t be overlooked.",
      "I am told the player would dearly like to make it back into the Atletico Madrid side and that is his priority, but clubs are paying real interest to him and he is very much one to keep an eye on for January.",
      "Chelsea may be sweating on the availability of Cole Palmer ahead of their Premier League clash against Manchester United.",
      "The Blues' talisman made his first start in nearly one month against Bayern Munich and scored for the second consecutive game after grabbing a goal in the 2-2 draw with Brentford off the bench last weekend.",
      "He played the full 90 minutes at Allianz Arena and appeared to be holding his groin in the latter stages of the clash. When asked about that, Enzo Maresca said: \"Cole, I think he's okay. I asked him after the game, he said that he's okay.\"",
      "There were also concerns over Trevoh Chalobah after he clutched his shoulder following a dual with Harry Kane. After receiving treatment, he came back on and completed the game.",
      "Liam Delap, Romeo Lavia, Benoit Badiashile, Dario Essugo and Levi Colwill are all expected to miss out."

      "Some good news at Manchester United: Lisandro Martinez continues to make progress in his recovery from injury.",
      "On Wednesday, Martinez uploaded a photo of himself running on grass at Carrington alongside United physiotherapist Ibrahim Kerem.",
      "Martinez's knee buckled when he fell to the ground against Crystal Palace at the beginning of February, and it was confirmed he had suffered an injury to his cruciate ligament.",
      "United will continue to carefully handle Martinez as he enters the latter stages of rehabilitation and he will only be available for selection again when medical staff deem him to be fully fit and ready.",
      "The sight of Martinez skipping along the turf at Carrington is a boost, as the next step will be returning to full team training. However, United sources have been reluctant to put a timeframe on when Martinez will be available again, so it might still be a while until he joins the main group.",
      "It's understood Martinez will not return imminently and has some way to go with his rehabilitation.",
      "Martinez was spotted on a handful of matchdays at the end of last season. The 27-year-old joined the celebrations after beating Athletic Bilbao at Old Trafford and he arrived with the squad, wearing a Paul Smith club suit, at the Estadio de San Mames for the Europa League final against Tottenham.",
      "The defender also took part in the lap of appreciation at Old Trafford on the final day of the season. He was joined by his wife and newborn and was spotted waving at supporters.",
      "Martinez travelled to the United States this summer to continue his rehabilitation programme around the squad, which allowed him to still feel part of the group during his recovery.",
      "The Argentina international has had the challenge of overcoming a handful of injuries during his time in Manchester and will face the task of trying to win back his starting role in the XI when he eventually returns.",
      "Leny Yoro played on the left side of the back-three at the end of last season and delivered strong performances. The presumption was Yoro would continue in that position this term, but he has been permenantly relcoated to the right, with Luke Shaw chosen to start on the opposite side.",
      "Shaw was poor in the Manchester derby defeat, leading to calls to remove him from the starting XI and Martinez has an easier task to earn his role back now he is contending with Shaw.",
      "Martinez will be eased back into action gently, but if he can reproduce the kind of form that established him as a fan favourite then he will be able to lock down the left-sided role.",
      "Shaw could have done better for each of Manchester City's goals. He had performed well up until that game, but most would agree that Martinez is a better fit for the role.",
      "Martinez is a natural centre-back and Shaw has been playing as an auxiliary left-sided central defender. It's been interesting that Amorim has not considered Shaw as a serious option for left wing-back.",
      "The potential spanner in the works is that Martinez still needs to prove he is still the same player who won fans' hearts in 2022/2023. Martinez was outstanding in his first season, however, he has suffered injuries and hasn't strung together a similarly consistent run of performances.",
      "Having said that, there were positive glimmers last winter with Martinez showing a different side of his game by contributing four goal involvements between mid-December and January.",
      "Martinez's pass for Amad's winner at the Etihad was exceptional and his goal against Liverpool at Anfield was another highlight. United have missed Martinez's proactiveness and his spirit in the dressing room.",
      "United fans will be delighted to hear that Martinez is on the comeback trail. It might be a while until he returns, but it will be a relief when he is available again.",

      "Amorim has overseen United's worst start to a Premier League campaign for 33 years. Chelsea are the bookmakers' favourites to win, although the London club have not won at Old Trafford since 2013.",
      "United should have an advantage over Chelsea because they have had a full week to prepare, while Maresca's side lost against Bayern Munich in the Champions League on Wednesday.",
      "Amorim is under huge pressure to secure wins, but Maresca is adamant that United have a \"magnificent\" head coach, as he explained in his pre-match press conference.",
      "\"The only thing I can say, I really appreciate Ruben [Amorim],\" said Maresca.",
      "\"I watched his games since in Sporting. He's a magnificent manager. Like all the managers, when you start a new project sometimes you can struggle a little bit more or less. But I don't have any doubt he's a fantastic manager.\"",
      "Maresca continued: \"I think it's always difficult to play United away in their stadium, Old Trafford, so I don't think now is the right moment, or next year is the right moment, or last year was the right moment",
      "\"They are a difficult team, in a difficult stadium. I watched the games that they played this season and some of the games they played was not the real result, in terms of... even the City game, until 1-0 and 2-0, they were in the game and they had a few chances to score when it was 0-0, so it will be a tough game, no doubt.",
      "\"I prefer to play a Champions League game, no doubt, but at the same time the reality says they have had an entire week to prepare for the game and we played a game two days ago.",
      "\"They [United] have the desire to win this game. When you struggle, you have the desire that you want to win. Against Chelsea, at home, there are all the reasons this can be very important for them.\"",
      "Cole Palmer picked up a groin injury against Bayern Munich, but Maresca confirmed he was \"okay\".",
      "On the fitness of the rest of his squad, Maresca said: \"We flew back yesterday and have a session now so we need to assess some of the players. There are some doubts but we haven't done any sessions after Wednesday's game so we will see after.",
      "\"Wednesday's game is a normal game in terms of the Champions League. We knew it would be a tough game - we tried our best. For periods we were very good, but there are things to improve.\"",
      "Juan Mata was responsible for Chelsea's last victory at Old Trafford in May 2013. The former United midfielder scored in the 87th minute to wrap up a late win for Chelsea when Rafael Benitez was in charge.",
      "Chelsea drew 1-1 with United when they last visited Old Trafford in November.",

      "Manchester United loanee Marcus Rashford fired a brutal reminder to head coach Ruben Amorim after his match-winning double. The 27-year-old lauded new boss Hansi Flick as his brace was enough for Barcelona to kick off their Champions League campaign with a 2-1 win over Newcastle United.",
      "The England international opened his account for the La Liga giants after his display reiterated his quality. Rashford left United on loan in the summer after finding himself out of favour with Portuguese tactician Amorim.",
      "He showed flashes of quality during his temporary spell with Aston Villa last season, earning him a recall for the Three Lions, before he made the move to the Spanish champions this summer.",
      "Rashford's double downed the Magpies as he single-handedly dragged Barcelona through, firstly with a header to break the deadlock. But he stole the headlines with an outstanding long-range effort to double the lead for Flick's side.",
      "The United academy graduate heaped praise on the former Bayern Munich head coach, months after Amorim explained why he couldn't force his way back into the Portuguese's plans at Old Trafford.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "\"He's [Hansi Flick] is a top man, top coach and he'll be delighted with not just the three points but the way we won,\" said Rashford at full-time. \"Most goal kicks, they're pressing so high, we still tried to play out from the back, it doesn't work all the time but we looked a positive team and with the quality we have, we can always make things happen.\"",
      "In February, the former Sporting CP head coach confessed that he didn't see eye-to-eye with Rashford over playing styles which led to his Villa move.",
      "\"I couldn't get Marcus to see the way you're supposed to play football and to train the way I see it,\" Amorim said. \"Sometimes you have one player that is really good with one coach, and the same player with another coach is different.",
      "\"I wish the best to Rashford and to [Villa manager] Unai Emery, and they can connect because he's a very good player.\"",
      "Rashford made a key contribution to helping Barcelona make a winning start to their League Phase as they look to go one better than last season, following their semi-final exit.",
      "\"Honestly, it's an amazing experience. I've always been a huge admirer of Barcelona, people my age have watched them from when we was younger, amazing football, amazing players and we want to win as much as possible.",
      "\"100 percent, I'm full of excitement. I'm determined, motivated and the quality in the team it's refreshing. The team is so young, they play with such confidence and understanding of the game, here isn't an easy place to come. I've won here a few times where we've not played the way we wanted to play, we gave a good account of ourselves and got the three points.",
      "\"It's to win it, nothing else is on our minds. We know how tough the competition is, last year they almost got there but this year it's about going one step more.\"",

      "Alan Shearer has suggested this weekend's clash against Chelsea could be key for the future of under-pressure Ruben Amorim at Manchester United.",
      "United have so far struggled to show any improvement this season, enduring their worst start to a Premier League campaign in 33 years. They have recorded just one win, against Burnley, losing two games and drawing another.",
      "After last weekend's 3-0 defeat to Manchester City at the Etihad Stadium, Chelsea represents another crucial match even at this early stage of the season. Enzo Maresca's side have not won at Old Trafford since 2013.",
      "Speaking about the situation at Old Trafford, Shearer shared his views with Betfair. \"It was men against boys last weekend at the Etihad,\" he said. \"They were miles apart in terms of ability, system, attitude and whatever else you want to name despite what Man United have spent in the summer.",
      "\"I don't think they can afford to be beaten like that again this weekend. If they were then you'd have to fear for what's going to happen going forward for the manager. Something must improve rapidly. Man United can't be lingering in 14th/15th/16th in the Premier League. There hasn't been an improvement at all up to now and that can't continue with what they spent.",
      "\"There has to be something that gets them going and if that doesn't happen quickly then everyone knows the rules when it comes to football management. It's on both the manager and players but I do think there's a lot in the system and despite what the manager says, he's not going to change his ways, he'll stick to that system.",
      "\"He's either going to die on his sword or get the success that he needs. At the minute it looks really negative, and I don't think a lot of those players are suited to the system. Amorim knows, he believes, and he will either keep or lose his job. It's a really interesting weekend and one where he can't take another beating like they did last weekend.\"",

      "Marcus Rashford sent a pointed message to Ruben Amorim during his spectacular display for Barcelona in the Champions League.",
      "The Manchester United academy prospect enjoyed a statement performance in his side's 2-1 away victory over Newcastle United. Rashford, 27, endured a frustrating first half where several attempts at goal were blocked by brave Newcastle defenders.",
      "However, he came alive after the restart, scoring two brilliant goals in his first appearance in England with Hansi Flick's side. The first was a 12-yard, pinpoint header from a Jules Kounde cross, which left Magpies goalkeeper Nick Pope with no chance.",
      "Rashford was not necessarily known for his aerial threat during his time at Old Trafford, but his second goal was the kind of strike that made him one of the country's most exciting young players.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "He dinked inside a Newcastle challenge and struck a 25-yard effort which spectacularly flew into the far corner off the underside of the post.",
      "There was a major difference in the celebrations of both of his goals. When Rashford headed in his first, he reacted with sheer, unbridled delight, having found the net in the competition for the first time since October 2021.",
      "However, after finding the top corner with his incredible second, Rashford jogged over to the corner flag and put his right index finger to his head. It was a pose most United fans would associate with the England international.",
      "Considering the manner of his celebration, it may have even been a message to Amorim, who banished him from the first team for the best part of a year. The Portuguese boss voiced his displeasure with Rashford's attitude in training and left him out of his plans, before loaning him to Aston Villa last January.",
      "Amorim sent Rashford to the so-called 'Bomb Squad' this summer, where he remained until Barcelona loaned him. He had been getting up to speed with the the La Liga side, up until last weekend.",
      "In Barcelona's 6-0 demolition of Valencia, Rashford contributed an impressive assist, finding Raphinha with a precise, in-swinging delivery. Barcelona manager Hansi Flick rewarded him with a start against Newcastle and it's safe to say Rashford took his opportunity.",
      "The German substituted him for Dani Olmo in the 82nd minute, when his work for the evening was certainly done. The only negative for Rashford is he has set the bar very high for a fanbase who is used to watching world class wingers.",
      "Most significantly for Rashford, the Englishman's brace was completed in front of Three Lions manager Thomas Tuchel, who was watching the match at St. James' Park.",
      "Meanwhile, United's new, £200million attacking tripartite Bryan Mbeumo, Matheus Cunha and Benjamin Sesko have only contributed one goal between them in all competitions.",

      "Anthony Gordon netted the only goal for the hosts in stoppage time. Nonetheless, it was the perfect return to England for Rashford, who joined Barcelona on loan earlier in the summer.",
      "The 27-year-old was dropped from Amorim's squad following heavy criticism from the Portuguese manager. Before his move to the Nou Camp, Rashford hadn't featured for the Reds since December 2024 and later joined Aston Villa on a short loan spell.",
      "Speaking on BBC's Champions League highlights show, Butt believes Amorim may be left questioning his decision to let Rashford go, as United continue to struggle for a consistent goal threat during their worst start to a season in 33 years.",

      "The England international, 27, struck a brace in the second half - his first goal was a header and the second an astonishing strike from 25 yards. He left his United teammates speechless, and Lamine Yamal, who missed the match due to a groin injury, also took to social media to share his reaction.",
      "\"It's going good. I am obviously learning a lot,\" Rashford said after the game. \"It's a new way of football, but I am enjoying it all and I think it is making me a better player. That is what I am here to do - to help the team win, but also to try to improve and be the best that I can. It is an amazing experience.",
      "\"I have always been a huge admirer of Barcelona, most people my age have watched them play from when we were younger. It is amazing football and amazing players. We just want to win as much as possible. I am very motivated and determined. The quality we have in the team excites me. It's refreshing to play with these players.\"",
      "Here, we take a closer look at what the Spanish press have said about Rashford's display;",
      "Miguel Quintana from Marca, wrote: \"Marcus Rashford arrived for days like yesterday. A Champions League away game. At a packed St. James' Park, with a spectacular atmosphere. Against a very good team, Eddie Howe's Newcastle, who played a very uncomfortable game with a tremendously aggressive high press. For several stretches of the match, he managed to nullify Barca's play despite the efforts of Pedri and Frenkie de Jong. They tried to bring some order to the chaos, but it was difficult. Newcastle started the second half like the first; bringing a pace and energy to the game that was difficult for any team to handle, including Barca.",
      "\"But then, in a somewhat isolated play that didn't convey much of a sense of danger, Jules Kounde whipped out his left foot and Rashford found an open spot in the box to break the deadlock. Rashford wasn't exactly having a great game either. Up to the 58th minute, he'd lost 15 balls, hadn't made a single dribble in his three attempts, and his first four shots had either hit an opponent or gone well wide of Nick Pope's goal. The stats, as you see, are horrible. He wasn't getting any success.",
      "\"But he didn't stop trying until he found that first goal. Then, surely fueled by the confidence of that first goal as a Barca player, Rashford unleashed one of those shots that drew comparisons to Cristiano Ronaldo in his early days at United. And the game was over. In two actions, in two swipes, he ended a match we'll only remember for the score-line, despite the fact that it had more significance than the 2-1 final score suggests. And that, among other things, was why Rashford arrived.",
      "Xavier Bosch wrote: \"For the exciting start of the Champions League, Barcelona fans were hoping Rashford's time would come. After four games of flashes, some good plays, but only a little bit of effort when he got into the box, it was necessary for the star acquisition of the summer to start making a difference. And he did so at the best moment and on the most important night of the season. Barca wasn't playing badly, but, quite simply, during the first hour of the match, it wasn't Barca.",
      "\"The English pressure was beyond suffocating. The Catalans couldn't think, couldn't control the ball, and barely threatened the opponent's penalty area. And then, in the 57th minute, after a gallop from Raphinha, Kounde invented a left-footed cross and placed it right on the penalty spot. Rashford appeared in place of the missing [Robert] Lewandowski.",
      "\"Barca had done the hardest part; score. And score with their first shot on goal. The second, just nine minutes later, also went in. Another stunning goal from Rashford with his foot, from far away, a tremendous shot that hit the far post. Or rather, the crossbar. It was his time to make Barca history. And he did.\"",
      "Juan Jimenez, wrote: \"A solid Barca, far from the disappointing European performances of not so long ago, secured their first major victory at the tough Newcastle stadium. Rashford put the finishing touches on the match with two stunning goals that allow Barcelona to head into the Champions League with the confidence of knowing they're at a high level physically and on par with the competition's big favourites.",
      "\"The second half began on standby. No changes, no clear leader. None of the noise from the start at St James' Park. But things quickly broke down. Rashford, erratic in the first half, planted his feet on the ground and firmly headed in a tender cross from Kounde. Rashford once again gave Hansi Flick reason to speak, having empowered him beforehand by recalling how he had followed his career almost since the beginning.\"",
      "Pablo Rivas, wrote: \"In their Champions League opener, Newcastle and Barcelona faced off at St James' Park in a duel that left few scoring opportunities, and Barca, with Rashford playing the hero, took the victory thanks to his striking power. In a very tight match, Flick's team knew how to adapt to an opponent that kept them uncomfortable throughout the match. Newcastle, just like in the first half, came out in the second half with a very high pressure that prevented the Blaugranas from initiating attacking plays from the defence.",
      "\"Just when it seemed Newcastle had their backs against the ropes, the man of the night, Rashford, would emerge once again. After a solo effort by Raphinha, the ball fell to Kounde, who, with a beautifully measured cross, found the head of the English striker. The reactions were quick to come, and Newcastle manager Howe made four substitutions that revolutionised the match. At times, his team was superior, but in the 67th minute, the Barca hero reappeared. A second shot, a second goal of the night for Rashford.",
      "\"Barcelona, true to its philosophy, dominated possession and left the home side with no chance of equalising. The match ended with Barca, who, despite playing more effectively than playing well, secured their first three points in this season's Champions League.\"",

      "Rasmus Hojlund endured a difficult game against Manchester City in Napoli's Champions League match at the Etihad on Thursday evening - his first match on English soil since leaving Manchester United last month.",
      "The 22-year-old, who completed the loan move to Napoli from United this summer, made his Napoli debut last weekend in their 3-1 win over Fiorentina, scoring a goal. This week, Hojlund started again for Antonio Conte's side.",
      "The United loanee moved to Napoli after struggling to get regular game time under Ruben Amorim. The Italian side have the option to make his move permanent come next summer, for a fee of around £38million (€44m).",
      "During his debut against Fiorentina, his efforts were praised by the Italian media but it wasn't all plain sailing against City, as he had to fill in defensively after Giovanni Di Lorenzo was sent off for fouling Erling Haaland just outside the box. In the end City secured a 2-0 victory, with goals from Haaland and Jeremy Doku.",
      "Football Italia - Man City 2-0 Napoli – Di Lorenzo decision dictates final result",
      "Peter Young of Football Italia awarded Hojlund a six for his performance, writing: \"Tried to make a nuisance of himself in the early stages, but was never going to be blessed with opportunities after the early red card.\"",
      "Tutto Mercato - Di Lorenzo gets Conte in trouble, Milinkovic's strong debut isn't enough.",
      "Tutto Mercato's Piero Paolo Matrone also awarded the striker a six, adding: \"With being down to ten men, there is practically only him forward to bring pressure. He takes himself to the penalty area in order to try to defend the 0-0, then comes out exhausted.\"",
      "Tutto Napoli - Milinkovic and Politano Heroes, Di Lorenzo Naive",
      "Davide Baratto of Tutto Napoli, also gave Hojlund a six out of 10 and observed: \"Not much ball, a lot of movement. Hard to judge.\"",
      "II Mattino - The best and worst of the match",
      "Il Mattino awarded the Danish striker five out of 10. \"He put pressure on City's central defenders, especially Ruben Dias,\" the outlet wrote.",
      "\"It was a game of great sacrifice and very few playable balls: he tried to help as much as he could, dropping deep and making elastic movements. He was a ghost, but not entirely his fault.\"",
      "Hojlund remains highly regarded by Antonio Conte and his coaching staff.",
      "\"I knew Rasmus because he played with Atalanta and then he came to Man United,\" the Italian boss said this week. \"In my opinion we are talking about a player with great potential and he is only 22, so he has a whole career ahead of him.",
      "\"When we spoke with him, I felt he was really happy to get this new experience and he said he was ready and wanted to play for me and for Napoli. He has great potential and now it's up to me to improve him and to grow and to become a really really top striker. Whether they come from the Premier League or any other championship, the important thing is that the players who arrive or come onto the pitch can give something.\"",
      "Meanwhile, Napoli director Giovanni Manna spoke about the striker ahead of their game against City, telling Sky Sport Italia: \"Hojlund settled in very quickly, it is a strong squad, he already knows Italy even if he was young, and Manchester United's results last season were tough for everyone. He arrived with a positive spirit, and we believe he can have a good impact.\"",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Manchester United suffered a 3-0 defeat to Manchester City on Sunday afternoon.",
      "Phil Foden scored the opening goal in the 18th minute, finding the corner with a header after some excellent work from Jeremy Doku.",
      "Erling Haaland scored early in the second half and then added another with just over 20 minutes remaining to take the game away from United.",
      "Here are the talking points and moments you might have missed from the game:",
      "Bayindir's confidence is shattered",
      "Altay Bayindir wanted the ground to swallow him up when he conceded the third goal. Haaland finished with ease to net his second of the game and a desolate Bayindir stared at the turf.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo was spotted on the halfway line trying to get Bayindir's attention. Mbeumo was screaming at his goalkeeper, trying to tell him to keep his head up, and he eventually got the message across.",
      "Ruben Amorim confirmed at his pre-match press conference that Bayindir would start, despite making mistakes against Arsenal and Burnley. That backfired because Bayindir was shaky from the first whistle.",
      "He was a bundle of nerves and went down to the ground far too easily for Haaland's first goal. Mbeumo sensed he was low on confidence after conceding City's third and tried to encourage him.",
      "It feels like only a matter of time before Senne Lammens is the first choice goalkeeper.",
      "City fans do the Poznan",
      "City fans brought out The Poznan after going three goals ahead. The fans in front of the press box turned around in glee to face journalists and the dance spread around the entire lower tier.",
      "United only trailed by a goal at the interval and could have found a way back into the contest, but they capitulated in the space of 15 minutes and a lot of fans in the away section started to leave early.",
      "Amorim has overseen some humiliating defeats and a 3-0 loss to City will be added to the catalogue.",
      "The terrace exchange",
      "Former City director of football Txiki Begiristain was shown on the big screen. He received warm applause from the home support, but United fans responded: \"You cheating b*******, you know what you are.\"",
      "There was another rendition of the chant just minutes into the contest, but City fans fired back after taking the lead through Foden, singing their own version of the Amorim chant.",
      "\"Crying from the Stretford End... He'll turn the Reds around,\" they taunted before reverting to \"Old Trafford is falling down, Amorim is a f****** clown. Glazers staying 10 more years\".",
      "There was a debate on a radio station about whether United and City are still proper rivals, but you only need to listen to matchgoing fans to know that was a stupid suggestion.",
      "United fans who work with City supporters will dread going to work this morning.",
      "United need more leaders",
      "Noussair Mazraoui went down with an injury just outside the City box at the start of the second half and Doku approached him to gesture that he was exaggerating the extent of the issue.",
      "City fans whistled at Mazraoui while he took his time to get back to his feet. Leny Yoro began to make his way over, seemingly looking to protect his colleague from Doku's rant.",
      "Yoro was the only United player to offer protection to Mazraoui. The dressing room needs more characters like Yoro.",
      "The midfield is a problem",
      "The decision to start Ugarte raised eyebrows. The midfielder had been hooked at half-time against Grimsby Town after failing to track back for their first goal and was an unused substitute against Burnley.",
      "Amorim was expected to continue with Casemiro and Bruno Fernandes, but he handed another chance to Ugarte because he felt the 24-year-old's pressing ability and energy would be valuable.",
      "Ugarte vindicated Amorim's decision to start him. He was the best player in a red shirt in the first half, breaking up play and stifling City attacks, and he earned warm applause from his manager when he played a wonderful pass over the top to Mbeumo, who was flagged offside.",
      "However, Fernandes had another off day - he was poor when he missed a penalty against Fulham at Craven Cottage last month - and ultimately let the partnership down.",
      "The midfield is a problem for Amorim, but United didn't believe that area was a priority in the summer.",
      "Beautiful tribute for Hatton",
      "The death of legendary boxer Ricky Hatton was announced on Sunday morning. Hatton was a lifelong City supporter and was expected to attend Sunday's derby.",
      "There was a minute's applause held for Hatton prior to the game and the players wore black armbands. Both sets of fans joined in with the tribute and chanted together: \"There's only one Ricky Hatton.\"",
      "Hatton was a proper Mancunian icon and it was heartwarming to hear City and United fans sing his name together.",

      "Manchester United head coach Ruben Amorim defended his decision to play Bruno Fernandes in central midfield for the fourth game running at Manchester City.",
      "United lost 3-0 at the Etihad to leave them with four points from their first four Premier League games, their worst start to a season since 1992-93.",
      "Fernandes has dropped back into midfield this season following the signings of Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo, who had occupied the two playmaker roles before Cunha suffered an injury against Burnley two weeks ago.",
      "Amorim picked Amad alongside Mbeumo behind Benjamin Sesko while Fernandes was partnered by Manuel Ugarte, having started alongside Casemiro in the previous three league outings.",
      "United only have three out-and-out central midfielders in Ugarte, Casemiro and Kobbie Mainoo, with the latter yet to start in the league this term.",
      "\"Guys, I understand how football is,\" Amorim said. \"The results will dictate all the narratives. Against Arsenal, who is playing against Arsenal? Do you think we play well? Do you think we are the better team? Do you think that (Martin) Odegaard, (Declan) Rice and (Martin) Zubimendi are three top midfielders? They play with three. We play with two. One was Casemiro, the other was Bruno.",
      "\"Sometimes it is the dynamic of the team. Sometimes it is an opportunity that you score. I see it that way. I know that it is really hard for people [to understand]. The fans don't want to hear me saying these things. I know that they are not going to listen to nothing and be upset. With that, I cannot do nothing.",
      "\"I am trying to be rational and I don't lie to myself. I see the record. I understand the frustration of everybody and I understand any decision that came with that. But that conversation about the two midfielders, the pair, Kobbie and Manu, I understand all these narratives. But then when I look at certain games, we play with two. It is the same thing.",
      "\"Today when you imagine the game, why not use Amad, Bryan, Sesko and Bruno behind with the ball? To be the first guy receiving the ball and then with a lot of pace in front.",
      "\"I am trying to do different things, trying to imagine the game. And then when you don't win, it doesn't work, you take the critics. But that's it.\"",

      "Amie is a football writer covering clubs across the country, she has been a football fan all of her life and supports Leicester City. She graduated with a degree in Sport and Exercise Psychology in 2015. Amie has previous experience in local radio in Leicester and Leicestershire.",
      "It has been a disappointing start to the Premier League season for Manchester United.",
      "One win, one draw, and two losses in their first four games of the season have left them in 14th place in the table, with four points from a possible 12 available. A 3-0 loss against rivals Manchester City on Sunday afternoon was one to forget for United fans.",
      "It has also raised questions again about Ruben Amorim's future. The summer transfer window saw the club spend around £200 million on new players, including striker Benjamin Sesko and forwards Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha.",
      "The first games of the campaign have, however, shown the problems that remain in the squad. With the summer transfer window now closed, work will have to be done in January to address those issues.",
      "Amid growing pressure on his position, Amorim may already be looking to the work he can do when the window reopens if he is still at the club. Addressing problems in the winter window could relieve some of the pressure on the Portuguese boss.",
      "Here’s a look at what a dream January window could look like for Amorim and United.",
      "There’s no doubt that midfield reinforcements should be the priority for United going into the January window. The club did make moves for players in the summer.",
      "Brighton’s strong not-for-sale stance on Carlos Baleba caused them to walk away from any potential deal. But United could potentially try again in January in the hope that the Seagulls may be more open to a sale.",
      "If that’s the case, then negotiations could start, with an agreement between all parties hopefully being reached. The arrival of Baleba could potentially help give Bruno Fernandes more freedom, even if he is playing in a deeper midfield role.",
      "Another player linked with United in the last few days is Nottingham Forest’s Elliott Anderson. The player caught the eye with his performances for England against both Andorra and Serbia in the international break.",
      "The former Newcastle man has shown how he can control games and dictate the play, something that United have been missing so far this season. However, like with Baleba, a deal may not be easy to do with Forest, who will be keen to keep hold of a key player, especially during the first transfer window with Ange Postecoglou at the helm.",
      "Away from midfield, one other area where United probably need more cover is at right-back. Currently, Diego Dalot and Noussair Mazraoui are the two recognised right-backs in the squad.",
      "An injury or suspension to just one will leave United short on options. United have again been linked with an interest in Inter’s Denzel Dumfries.",
      "The full-back has recently admitted that he would be open to a Premier League move, and would add experience and quality to that side of defence.",
      "If United did complete the signings of both Baleba and Anderson, or two deeper midfielders in the January window, then it would allow Kobbie Mainoo to leave the club on loan for the second half of the season. The midfielder outlined his desire to leave on a temporary deal during the summer, but United refused.",
      "If the club can add to their midfield options, then it would free up the academy graduate to go out and get regular game time.",
      "Another player who could go out on loan is Tyler Fredricson. Lisandro Martinez is expected to be back from injury in the next couple of months, if the centre-back can get up to speed quickly then it would provide enough defensive cover to allow the 20-year-old to go out and get more games.",
      "Chido Obi could be a third candidate to go out on loan. After making his United debut last season, the striker is yet to make a matchday squad this season, and has been back playing for the U21 squad.",
      "A loan deal could see him get more of a taste for first-team football in the second half of the season, and hopefully return a better player.",
      "One player who could leave permanently is Tyrell Malacia. The full-back was linked with a move away in the summer, but a transfer never materialised.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "Goalkeepers: Senne Lammens, Altay Bayindir, Tom Heaton",
      "Defenders: Leny Yoro, Lisandro Martinez, Matthijs de Ligt, Harry Maguire, Ayden Heaven, Patrick Dorgu, Luke Shaw, Diego Leon, Denzel Dumfries, Diogo Dalot, Noussair Mazraoui",

      "A striking recall yet Ugarte was United's best player in the first half and operated at a level that was the polar opposite of his 45 minutes at Grimsby. Unable to halt City's second-half charge. 6",
      "Bruno Fernandes",
      "Guilty of failing to track the runner for another goal that United conceded three weeks after Emile Smith Rowe evaded him at Fulham. 5",

      "Ethan Williams has described the chance to play for Manchester United during the pre-season tour as \"life-changing.\"",
      "United travelled to the United States to compete in the Premier League Summer Series this summer, preparing for the new season with friendlies against West Ham, Bournemouth and Everton.",
      "Ruben Amorim included a handful of youngsters from the academy in the travelling tour squad. Williams made the cut and scored his first senior goal in a 4-1 win against Bournemouth.",
      "In August, Williams signed for Falkirk on a season-long loan. The forward made 17 appearances during his six-month loan with Cheltenham Town last term and will now try to develop his game in Scotland.",
      "Speaking to the Daily Record, Williams said: “I played about 15 minutes against Bournemouth in Chicago in the summer. We won 4-1 and I scored. The whole team was really warming to me and the other young players. To play and score on tour was life-changing. Something I will never forget.",
      "“Coming off the back of that, getting the opportunity to play here in a good league against good teams is really important to me. I just can’t wait to get my foot in the door and start pushing for starts.\"",
      "Explaining his move to Falkirk, he said: “I’d been speaking to the manager (John McGlynn) and his coaches for quite some time over the summer. Going on tour with United it was quite difficult, communication wise. But once it was set in motion I was ready to come here. I’m happy to be here.",
      "“It’s always good to know that a manager trusts you. For him to come to me and be interested is quite flattering. I’m proud to be here.",
      "“The team has had back-to-back promotions and want to play aggressive football against the top teams. It’s a style I like as a winger. That’s what sold it on me.",
      "“The Scottish Premiership is a very good league, comparable with leagues in England. My first experience of it was good. It was a really proud moment and I’m thankful the manager trusts me and gave me minutes.\"",
      "Darren Fletcher was appointed as United's Under-18 manager in the summer, but his previous role involved keeping tabs on academy prospects and reporting on their progress.",

      "“It’s quite an unreal experience when you step back and think ‘wow’ I’m actually talking with Darren Fletcher. It’s a mad experience for a young kid. But being up here and around it is a good thing.",
      "“Darren was one of the first team assistant coaches, he’s with the U18s now but I’m in contact with him. He knows the game and is a big part of Manchester United. He’s someone that is looking to help me in my journey.",
      "“He’s been asking how everything’s going. I told him I’ve settled well and the team is really welcoming. Everyone is really heartwarming with me and getting around the lads has been a good experience.\"",

      "Williams joined United's academy from Rochdale at Under-14 level. He is the nephew of Alex Williams, who rose to prominence in the early 1980s as one of the first black goalkeepers in the modern top flight, making more than 100 appearances for Manchester City in a trailblazing career.",

      "It is difficult to view Marcus Rashford scoring two excellent and decisive Champions League goals in a narrow win for Barcelona against Newcastle as anything other than yet another reason to laugh and shake one’s head at Manchester United.",
      "Mediawatch hasn’t actually tried to see it from a different angle, so important and fun it is to marvel at how players immediately become good again once they leave Old Trafford.",
      "But it is inevitable that some would push that agenda too far, with this the top story from the MailOnline on Friday morning:",
      "‘The start of Marcus Rashford’s redemption? Barcelona star reveals why he is ‘better’ in subtle Man United dig as he is challenged to take the next step after stunning double in Newcastle win’",
      "A passing knowledge of Rashford and how he has generally publicly discussed Manchester United with respect and reverence despite that not always being reciprocated is all that’s required to know this ‘subtle Man United dig’ is almost definitely complete bumwater. But we are obliged to check out of interest to see just how daft it is.",
      "‘Rashford of course was delighted with his haul, saying: “It’s going good [in Spain], I am learning a lot as it is a new way of football, but I am enjoying it all and I think it is making me a better player.”‘",
      "The lads Amorim and Ratcliffe should know by now where to apply the ointment for that sick burn. It’s a dig so subtle you would be forgiven for not realising it existed.",
      "",
      "These are, by the way, ludicrous ways of describing that glorious second Rashford goal:",
      "‘The United loanee, bombed out and insulted by the hapless Ruben Amorim last season, then hammered home a second with a deflected shot which cannoned in off the underside of the bar’ – Dave Kidd, The Sun.",
      "‘Dodging a challenge from a Newcastle defender, he unleashed a 25-yard strike that spectacularly found its way into the far corner off the post’ – Patrick Austen-Hardy, Daily Mirror website.",
      "",
      "It is interesting to see Ian Herbert write in the Daily Mail about how Rashford bore ‘the look of a man who felt he owned the place and this stage,’ that ‘he has found something in Catalonia and the intensive Spanish lessons he is undertaking several times a week are more than mere diplomacy’.",
      "And there we all were thinking he had built a Duolingo streak just to keep up appearances.",
      "‘While Ruben Amorim treated him with thinly veiled contempt, Flick has given him professional respect,’ the deputy chief sports writer adds.",
      "Herbert goes on to say that while at times ‘it was hard to locate much evidence’ of Rashford ‘rediscovering the talent and belief he had put down somewhere and struggled to pick up,’ he ultimately provided, well, this:",
      "‘Evidence, before our very eyes, that the players we write off so soon are perhaps not the lost souls we believe them to be.’",
      "And that is interesting precisely because Herbert himself also wrote in January about how Rashford needed to be ‘talked out of his current sense of victimhood’ and was ‘apparently incapable of saving himself’.",
      "Which seems a little stronger than simply writing someone off or calling them a ‘lost soul’.",
      "It was obviously framed through the experience of Mark Hughes and how he ‘actually viewed wearing the No 10 jersey at Manchester United as a privilege and something to cherish,’ before taking the brave and bold decision to join Barcelona.",
      "And how Rashford, who has ‘a far higher opinion of himself’, ‘had rather imagined that he, too, would be heading to Barcelona’ but ‘as anyone could have predicted, Barca aren’t remotely interested in him, and neither is any other big club’.",
      "Oh, Ian. At least in the intervening eight months he has belatedly learned that the players we write off so soon – or refer to as ‘victims’ with high opinions of themselves who are ‘apparently incapable’ of turning things around – are perhaps not the lost souls we believe them to be.",
      "Although he did call Rashford a ‘boy, masquerading as a 27-year-old’ who ‘even makes Grealish seem like the soul of sobriety’ and is ‘viewed by some managers as too much of a risk, too toxic’ in July. So that lesson must have been recent. Thursday evening, maybe?",
      "This line from that January article is also pretty good:",
      "‘Goodness knows how Rashford – who says he feels ‘misunderstood’ and ‘disheartened’, despite years of coddling by United – would have dealt with what came Hughes’ way in Spain.’",
      "Fairly well so far. Three more goals this season and he’ll match what Hughes scored across 37 appearances in Spain. Not bad to say ‘Barca aren’t remotely interested’.",
      "",
      "The biggest bowl of piping hot nonsense is served up dutifully by Patrick Austen-Hardy of the Reach website stable, who predictably lap it up.",
      "For the Daily Mirror website, Rashford’s goal celebration obviously ‘speaks volumes’ despite him using said goal celebration since late 2022.",
      "Sticking his finger to his temple is, in all fairness, entirely specifically a ‘pointed message’. But to Amorim? When Rashford has been doing that for almost three years now?",
      "‘Considering the manner of his celebration, it may have even been a message to Amorim…’",
      "True. It may also have been a message to Donald Trump, or AI, or that weird Liverpool fan. Or maybe it was just something he has done for absolutely ages, and well before Amorim even came into his orbit.",
      "",
      "And of course, Rashford reminding the world he can be quite good at football has to prompt the return of just the dirt worst headline trope.",
      "‘Man Utd Marcus Rashford transfer recall rules explained and if winger can return’ – Daily Express website.",
      "The short version is that a) they have no idea if Rashford can be recalled, b) they acknowledge he probably can’t, going by how loan deals of this profile are generally structured, and c) even if he can, he absolutely won’t be because none of the parties involved will want to.",
      "But there was obviously mileage in pretending Rashford might have been recalled from his Aston Villa loan so why not bring that energy into a full season of speculating if and whether Amorim might bring him back to exile him and decimate his market value further?",
      "Man Utd forward Marcus Rashford has hailed his “refreshing” loan move to Barcelona after scoring twice in a 2-1 win over Newcastle on Thursday night.",
      "Liverpool have a ‘psychological edge’ over their opponents even while ‘looking pretty vulnerable at times’ because they have invented scoring goals.",
      "Ruben Amorim continuing to dare Man Utd to sack him and Liverpool emerging from Arsenal v Manchester City as the biggest winner makes this a big weekend.",
      "Marcus Rashford joined the Leaving Man United party with two goals, the second an absolute net-ripper, to steer Barcelona past Newcastle.",
      "Unless it’s against European elite, Champions League games have become basically like playing Bournemouth now for Premier League teams.",

      "Here’s one stat-based nugget for each Premier League club after the first four games of the season, with numbers from the very excellent fbref.com.",
      "",
      "Arsenal have nine goals from 14 shots on target. To put that in some perspective, doom-spiralling crisis club West Ham have had 19 shots on target this season. Liverpool and Chelsea, joint top-scorers at this stage with Arsenal on nine, each have 21 shots on target.",

      "",
      "And indeed more than everyone apart from Manchester United, Chelsea and Liverpool. But they rank only tenth for shooting accuracy, and have the sixth bottom for non-penalty xG per shot at 0.09.",
      "So lots of shooting, but not necessarily from the most optimum position. It’s the xG equivalent of lobbing enough balls at enough coconuts until you win a goldfish. Although we will need a different shorthand for expected goldfish, because xG is taken and it will get confusing.",
      "",
      "They still prioritise quality over quantity when it comes to shooting. Only Burnley have attempted fewer shots on goal, but only Fulham make their attempts from a closer average distance than Brentford’s 14.1 yards. Brentford’s non-penalty xG/shot of 0.13 is the third highest in the division.",

      "We don’t claim to be boffin-like stats experts, clearly, but having the fewest shots of any team in the division (30) while allowing the most shots of any team in the division (76, which is already 21 more than anyone else) doesn’t seem a sustainable gameplan.",
      "Especially when you remember that tally doesn’t even include the two heartbreaking 95th-minute penalty kicks.",
      "What you can say for Burnley, is that they are not giving up lots of clear chances; only five teams have a lower goals/shots allowed figure than the Clarets’ 0.05. For context, West Ham’s figure is 0.23.",

      "The Cottagers’ average distance for attempts on goal is 13.8 yards, with Brentford and Tottenham – and there’s an obvious common factor there – the only other teams below 15 yards on average. Newcastle’s average shooting distance is a distinctly pot-shot 19.5 yards.",

      "The Red Devils allowed Rashford to join the Catalan giants in the summer transfer window after spending the second half of last season on loan at Aston Villa.",

      "He didn’t explode into life at Barcelona immediately, with rumours that the Catalans could terminate his loan early, but his two-goal display at St James’ Park on Thursday showed Barca fans what he can do.",
      "On Rashford’s situation at the Camp Nou, transfer expert Fabrizio Romano said on his YouTube channel: “And just to finish guys on Manchester United and on Barcelona, we have to touch on the Champions League night. And in this Champions League night, the big face on one side of Manchester, of course, is Erling Haaland, who scored 50 goals in 49 Champions League games.",

      "“And so Rashford starts performing for Barca and imagine the deal compared to Hojlund is completely different. For Hojlund, the 50 million euros are almost guaranteed. For Rashford is a loan with a buy option close at 30 million euros.",
      "“But the feeling is that now Rashford is already making an impact at Barcelona, man of the match, two goals in these important Champions League night, replacing Lamine Yamal in the best way possible. So Barca are very happy with Rashford.",

      "“A few weeks ago, we had reports of Barca considering to terminate early the loan of Marcus Rashford, I told you here on the channel, complete bulls**t, completely fake.",
      "“Now you can see how Rashford is performing, how Rashford is already becoming an important player for Barcelona, and these two goals in a crucial Champions League night from Barcelona are already a perfect message coming from the player.”",
      "“Honestly it’s an amazing experience, I’ve always been a huge admirer of Barcelona. Most people my age have watched them play from when we were younger, so it’s amazing football, amazing players and we just want to win as much as possible.”",
      "Rashford added: “I’m full of excitement. I’m very motivated, very determined and the quality we’ve got in the team, that excites me alone.",
      "“It’s refreshing to play with these guys. I’ve said it a few times but the team’s so young, they play with such confidence, such understanding of the game.”",
      "On Barcelona boss Hansi Flick, Rashford continued: “He’s a top coach, top man manager and he’ll be delighted today,’ said Rashford of his boss. ‘With the three points and the confidence that the team showed, believing in the way we wanted to play.",
      "“Most goal kicks, they’re pressing so high and we’re still trying to play from the back, the times we got out we looked like a positive team and with the quality we have we can always make things happen.”",

However, the team’s form was on the agenda and Ratcliffe was seeking to work through issues facing Amorim at the club.",

      "There are times when the title of this feature can seem bitterly ironic, but this weekend is not one of those weekends. This really is another Big Weekend on the back of last weekend, which was also very much a Big Weekend.",
      "This Big Weekend is one that could quite conceivably end with either Arsenal or Man City or indeed both an uncomfortable distance adrift of Liverpool even at this early stage, while all eyes will once again be on Ruben Amorim and his weirdly admirable ongoing insistence on denying objective reality. It’s a tactic we might all like to consider in these troubled times. Much easier than the alternative.",
      "And another Premier League weekend arrives with the really big question: will this finally be the game where Aston Villa score a goal?",
      "What if they don’t score a goal, though? What if they just never score another Premier League goal ever again? What then? Is there a plan in place for that?",
      "We don’t know.",
      "",
      "Assuming, as assume now we surely must, that a day earlier Liverpool have scored a preposterous late winner in the Merseyside Derby, this becomes an uncomfortably hefty early game between what are very likely the only two teams capable of giving the champions a problem over the course of the whole season.",
      "Neither would probably be choosing to play the other at the end of a weekend when the scoreboard pressure could be absolutely huge.",
      "If Liverpool have beaten Everton, then the scenarios in play involve either both these teams being six points adrift already, or City slipping nine points off the early pace, or Arsenal being five off the running and City eight away.",
      "It does very much feel like a game that might be most easily enjoyed by Liverpool fans basking in post-derby glow than either of the teams actually involved.",
      "But even without the whole ‘bollocksing up the title race in mid-September’ hoopla, there is still much to commend this fixture.",
      "That’s been true for a good few years now, since Arsenal managed to shake the habit of getting slapped silly every time City turned up.",
      "And last year Mikel Arteta even managed to shake off his usual big-game timidity to hand out a fearful thrashing of their own, with all the wonderful ‘stay humble’ saltiness that followed.",
      "Worth remembering also that that particular Arsenal statement of intent in the title race was followed by managing only one win from their next four games against Leicester, West Ham, Nottingham Forest and Manchester United.",
      "There’s a draining emotional heft to this fixture that both teams could probably do without just as the real two-games-a-week business kicks in, and every chance that no matter what happens at the Emirates the real winners are to be found at Anfield.",
      "",
      "Liverpool have played five proper competitive games of football this season. In three of those games they have eased themselves into a 2-0 lead, promptly p*ssed said 2-0 lead all up the wall, and then just gone and scored a ridiculous late winner anyway.",
      "It’s a fantastic bit, and long may it continue. It’s so rare for the best team in the country to also be the most fun to watch, and we should all try to cherish it while it remains the case here.",
      "The reason, most obviously, the best team is rarely the most fun is because the best team in the country is, almost by definition, unlikely to be one prone to repeated acts of nonsense. Liverpool certainly weren’t like this last season, and we much prefer this season’s approach as a neutral.",
      "The best team in the country might be the most electric going forward, or the most reliably secure at the back, or even both. But rare indeed is the season where the best team look simultaneously so vulnerable yet so inevitable.",
      "And with this newly impish, Jack Grealish-inspired Everton side looking far more capable than most Toffees of recent vintage of exploiting those Liverpool vulnerabilities we really could be in for a classic Merseyside derby.",
      "Just don’t whatever you do miss the last few minutes.",
      "",
      "It’s now one goal in his last 11 Aston Villa appearances for a striker Villa desperately need to start firing and soon.",
      "Sunderland away wouldn’t have been a fixture that filled Villa fans with dread when the fixture computer spat out its findings back in June, but a lot has changed since then. The Black Cats have two wins from two at home, and Villa need to find something soon to avoid this season spiralling into something truly unpleasant.",
      "They are still, preposterously, yet to score a single league goal a month into the campaign, crashed out of the Carabao at the first attempt – although there was at least a goal in that one, so progress, we guess? – and from next week have the added workload of European engagement to consider.",
      "It’s not that uncommon for a player to be in some need of the cliched one-to-go-in-off-his-backside at this stage of the season, and Watkins is very much there. But it’s something a bit different when a whole team is waiting for some buttock-based goalscoring good fortune to kick start an entire season.",
      "We mustn’t be too dramatic. We’re not yet in a Fear For Them situation with Villa, we really aren’t. But if this weekend goes wrong then it’s going to get harder and harder to ignore the warning signs.",

      "What’s really fun is that right now our money is firmly on c).",
      "Last season, we’d have said that Chelsea at home wasn’t a bad fixture for an under-pressure United and their Beleaguered Manager. One of the quirks of last season was that United – before and after Amorim’s arrival – were very good at sorting out the dreadful relegated teams and perfectly capable of summoning up some kind of dormant muscle memory of their glorious past when faced with any of their former rivals.",
      "They could be relied on to put up a decent show against your Liverpools, your Arsenals, your Man Citys and the Chelseas of this world as well as beating the very worst teams; it was the vast array of teams in the middle that United had problems with seemingly every single time.",
      "But this season they have already celebrated a played-quite-well-actually cup when losing 1-0 to Arsenal and been thoroughly outplayed in the end by Manchester City in the derby.",
      "We’re not yet quite sure about Chelsea this season, either, with an inconsistent start after their Club World Cup antics suggesting they might not quite be the title contenders we thought they could be.",
      "They really should be able to sort out United, though, possessing as they do exactly the kind of game-controlling midfielders Amorim so conspicuously lacks and all manner of tricky, clever forwards capable of exploiting the ongoing confusion that reigns within a defensive structure where, if anything for me, Clive, United sometimes have too many players back with the result that nobody’s quite sure who’s supposed to be doing what.",
      "We know by now that Amorim isn’t going to change. He will live by his back three and die by his back three, with the only question really just how overtly he will attempt to goad United into handing him that lovely £12m pay-off if/when it does all go wrong again against another team United used to consider a major rival really not that long ago.",
      "",
      "Fourth meets sixth at the King Power in what already feels like a pretty significant early clash between two key promotion contenders, with Leicester yet to truly convince or stamp their obvious class on the division since dropping back into it.",
      "Coventry, meanwhile, remain unbeaten yet have foolishly concentrated far too many of their division-leading 15 goals into two big daft wins when they could have been far more usefully spread around. Silly.",
      "",
      "You can’t say fairer than a lovely slice of Sunday lunchtime-ish Rome derby action to set you up for the big afternoon of Barclays to follow. Especially with both teams smarting ahead of this one after disappointing defeats last time out against Sassuolo and Torino.",
      "In a just and right world it would be on Channel 4, of course, rather than so-called ‘DAZN’, but one can’t have everything.",
      "",
      "Having pretty adroitly in the end avoided Champions League humiliation at the hands of Brann, Elisabeth Terland’s hat-trick helping them overcome a 1-0 first-leg deficit with a bit to spare, attention turns back to the WSL for United and the visit of Arsenal.",
      "It’s a battle between two of the four teams still boasting 100 per cent records after two games of the new season, and one that might give us a few clues about which if either of these teams might have the best chance of ending Chelsea’s seemingly unstoppable reign of terror.",

      "Legendary former Manchester United goalkeeper Peter Schmeichel has revealed he had “never heard of” Senne Lammens prior to the Red Devils being linked with him, and has told the club who they should’ve signed instead.",
      "United were told throughout the summer that their goalkeepers were not up to scratch. For a man who reached a Champions League final with Inter Milan, it was hard to tell Andre Onana had been close to that level.",
      "As such, in the final days of the summer, he was replaced by Lammens and loaned out to Trabzonspor.",
      "Pior to Lammens’ signing, though, there were links with Emiliano Martinez and Gianluigi Donnarumma. The former has won the World Cup and the latter the Champions League.",
      "Schmeichel feels those are the ilk of players United should have signed, instead of 23-year-old Lammens, from Royal Antwerp.",
      "“We should have signed Emi Martinez. In fact, we should have gone for Gianluigi Donnarumma when we had the chance,” he said.",
      "“With Martinez, everything was lined up and that felt like really good news, because he’s exactly the kind of goalkeeper Manchester United should have.",
      "“As for Lammens, I’ll be honest, I’d never heard of him until the link came up.",
      "“I know his stats are excellent across the top ten European leagues. But that was with Antwerp in Belgium, in a team that finished fifth.",
      "“Stats don’t show how you react after a mistake, or how you cope with the pressure of Manchester United. That pressure is unlike anywhere else in football.”",
      "Lammens has a fantastic save percentage, but has never played in a top-five league, has featured in the Champions League just once, and is yet to make his national team debut for Belgium.",
      "He is still yet to play for United despite being in place for their last Premier League game – the 3-0 loss to Manchester City.",
      "Indeed, Altay Bayindir was preferred between the sticks, despite rumours he could have been allowed to leave in the summer, and the goalkeeper having made mistakes during his time in the United net.",
      "When Lammens does get his first crack is unclear, as most would have expected he’d have been in immediately after his signing.",
      "In any case, Schmeichel was disappointed that he was the man signed, not a better option, and having one of the best players ever in your position, at the club you now play for, already on your back, is not a good start.",
      "Peter Schmeichel has questioned Manchester United letting a pair of stars leave the club, and he “hopes” one of them scores “25 goals” to show them what they’re missing.",
      "The brother of new Man Utd signing Senne Lammens attempted to stop him from joining the Red Devils but the Premier League club “gave him the best feeling”.",
      "Manchester United lost their third game of the season on Sunday as rivals Manchester City beat them 3-0 in a comprehensive performance.",
      "Man Utd legend Peter Schmeichel reckons the Red Devils could have saved £73m by keeping Rasmus Hojlund and not signing Benjamin Sesko.",
      "Wayne Rooney hit out at one Manchester United “panic buy” after Ruben Amorim’s side suffered a one-sided 3-0 loss against Manchester City.",

      "And following another Man Utd defeat, O’Hara has doubled down on his theory that Amorim should be sacked for former Red Devils boss Solskjaer.",

      "Antony and Rashford had both spent time out on loan last season, while Hojlund and Onana underperformed.",
      "Speaking on some of the exits, United legend Schmeichel suggested Antony’s was acceptable, but Hojlund still has a lot to offer to the Red Devils, and he hopes they can see that while he’s out on loan.",
      "He said: “With Antony, it’s different. He was never good enough for Manchester United. Yes, he scored on his debut, but very quickly you could see he didn’t have what it takes for the Premier League.",
      "“In Holland, playing in a dominant team, he looked good. But at United, the pace is relentless from the first minute to the last, the pressure is constant, and every opponent raises their game. To succeed here, you need something extra, and he didn’t have it. He’s moved on, and we wish him well.",
      "“The one that really pains me is Højlund. I honestly believe he could have been a 25-goal-a-season striker for Manchester United. The problem wasn’t him – it was the way the team played. The system didn’t suit him. When players like Garnacho or Rashford got the ball, they looked only to shoot. The ball into the No.9 never came, even though Rasmus was making really good runs.",
      "“The fans saw it. They loved him because he fought, he ran, he gave everything, and he had to play every game because there were no other strikers. Of course, when you don’t score as a striker, people point to it again and again. But what more could he do without service?",
      "“I’ve seen what he can do when he’s on form and gets the right service. That’s why I’m glad it’s only a loan. I hope he scores 25 goals, and that people at Old Trafford are then thinking: ‘We have to bring him back.’",
      "“With [Matheus] Cunha and [Bryan] Mbeumo now providing service, and Bruno [Fernandes] playing further up the pitch, I still believe he could be a fantastic striker for Manchester United. He’s already scored after just 30 minutes for Napoli, which shows his quality. He’s still our player, and that’s the positive.”",

      "Amorim could only lead Man Utd to a 15th-placed finish in the Premier League last term and there is speculation that the Red Devils hierarchy will not put up with another season outside the European places.",
      "And the Daily Mail reported earlier this week that Man Utd captain Fernandes has expressed his unhappiness at being put in a deeper midfield role after contributing 17 goals and 16 assists last term.",

      "‘Even one of his staunchest allies, captain Bruno Fernandes, is believed to be unhappy operating in a deeper midfield role.’",
      "And now journalist Graeme Bailey has told United In Focus that the Man Utd hierarchy are “furious about is the potential of leaks again”.",
      "Bailey said: ‘The one thing the club are furious about is the potential of leaks again, seeing stories about players and squad members not being convinced by Amorim or his tactics.",

      "‘United firmly believe they are building something, but they won’t and can’t allow internal discontent to impact on the club as a whole.’",
      "Speaking about his midfield in the aftermath of the 3-0 Manchester Derby defeat to Man City, Man Utd boss Amorim said: “It’s the same thing, it’s always the same conversation. They [City] put four in the middle, we have three central defenders and two midfielders.",
      "“You can see Bryan [Mbeumo] is always inside and [Benjamin] Sesko is there, so that conversation is always the same thing.",
      "“We play last year the same way – of course with difference because the opponent is playing in a different way against Liverpool, against all these teams in the same way.",
      "“So it’s not the midfielders because, again, if you feel that what you are going to do in the first goal has to do with the amount of midfielders. Doku receives the ball, turns to the defence and then takes two guys inside the box. Then the second half, we start really well with two midfielders.",
      "“You are near the box controlling the game and then throw-in, goal. Third goal, you are controlling the game, trying to open the game, Bryan has a great opportunity, Amad is pushing on the side, we had some distraction with going to the ball, Haaland has all the field to run so it’s not to do with the midfielders.",
      "“It’s the way you want to see the games. I saw a lot of teams playing here [at the Etihad Stadium] with five midfielders just blocking and they suffer more than us. I see a lot of games from Manchester United playing here with a lot of midfielders.",
      "“Opportunities sometimes with one, two, so it’s not about that. Again, sometimes we play with the three defenders, five defenders, sometimes it’s five midfielders or two midfielders. It depends on the game of the opponent.”",
      "Manchester United have been told to sell Bruno Fernandes and build around Kobbie Mainoo, but they face the ‘most excruciating’ outcome.",

      "The bookies aren’t often wrong so we’ve gone through the top 10 favourites to become United’s next manager.",
      "Frankly, it’s a s*** list. Bad enough to think that maybe 3-4-2-1 might work in the Championship after all.",
      "Please, Ruben. Just consider for a second that there might be a better way. Otherwise United should be bringing either the ex-England manager or a Barcelona legend back into management.",
      "Here’s how we’ve ranked the 10 current favourites to replace Amorim…",
      "",
      "Carrick failed to meet expectations at Middlesbrough in the Championship. Which makes a mockery of the fact that, at the time of writing, he’s third favourite for Amorim’s job.",
      "Of course, that’s down to his United legacy as one of the finest midfielders of the modern era. He also served as a coach and retains an unbeaten record as caretaker boss. Carrick’s link to United’s glorious past will always stand out on his CV. But the rest of it needs expanding and polishing before he can be considered a credible candidate for the top job at Old Trafford.",
      "",
      "Nuno’s stock has probably never been as high despite being sacked by Nottingham Forest. He left the City Ground after falling out with a man who falls out with everyone eventually, with Forest back in Europe for the first time in 30 years on his watch.",
      "Which is very commendable. Just not commendable enough to give him the keys to the Manchester United clown car.",
      "He would be far better off at West Ham.",
      "",
      "The nearly man of Dortmund has been out of work for over a year having left his boyhood club in the wake of their Champions League defeat to Real Madrid. Prior to that, he was a game away from winning the Bundesliga before blowing it spectacularly on the final day in 2023.",
      "Since leaving Dortmund, Terzic has spent his time preparing for his next opportunity, tapping into others’ knowledge to make sure he’s ready for wherever that might be. It was thought the German was on United’s list when they moved for Amorim.",
      "But Terzic seems to be looking for a project, the time for which he would never be afforded at Old Trafford.",
      "We have him pegged for Aston Villa.",
      "",
      "It was thought that Nagelsmann was only passing through international football and that he would be looking for a return to club management after the European Championships on home soil last year.",
      "But he then extended his stay to next summer’s World Cup, and subsequently signed a contract to manage Germany at Euro 2028. Presumably, he’s having a whale of time.",
      "So United would struggle to get the one-time coaching prodigy away from managing his country, especially given the mess he would be walking in to. That’s that then.",
      "",
      "The German won the FA Cup with Crystal Palace – a marvellous achievement that makes him an Eagles legend. Beating City also made him pretty popular at United. But it doesn’t make him qualified to put out the Old Trafford bin fire.",
      "Those lobbying for Glasner also point to the fact that he’s had success with 3-4-2-1, which Amorim is more wedded to than his wife. But Glasner would suffer the same as Amorim from the woeful lack of a midfielder than holds the system together.",
      "Doubtless Glasner would deserve a step up if he was to leave Selhurst Park. But there would have to be a bridging club between Palace and United.",
      "",
      "Much of what we think about Glasner applies to Iraola too. The Spaniard has done a wonderful job with Bournemouth. But Manchester United – especially THIS Manchester United – is a different proposition altogether.",
      "Iraola’s success at Bournemouth has come from high-press, high octane football. Which we know the current United squad is not built for.",
      "Would he get the time and breathing space to get them up to speed? Not a f***ing chance.",
      "",
      "Emery has already curried favour at Old Trafford by relieving United of Marcus Rashford and Jadon Sancho. Though that goodwill must be tempered by concerns over the Spaniard’s judgement if he really believed signing Sancho to be a good idea.",
      "Emery has done a very fine job at Villa, taking a once-proud club flirting with relegation back in to the Champions League, all the while dealing with restrictive budgets and an unsustainable wage bill.",
      "Which makes Emery an ideal candidate. And given the general feeling of uneasiness at Villa Park right now, the timing could be perfect.",
      "But, for reasons we’re struggling to explain, it’s a very difficult proposition to get excited about. Perhaps it is the memory of his attempt at succeeding Arsene Wenger at Arsenal, from which he has bounced back from superbly. His subsequent body of work at Villarreal and Villa has restored his reputation. And no one at Old Trafford should be looking down their nose at the 53-year-old. So any lack of anticipation would probably say more about United’s perception of themselves than it does about Emery.",
      "🚨 Top 10 available managers: Nuno to be in demand as ex-Man Utd bosses seek jobs…",
      "",
      "Pochettino has had his fingers burned by United before, who might have hired the Argentine to replace as many as three of their previous managers. But every time, they have gone in a different direction.",
      "All of which led Pochettino to the United States job. And it is very difficult to imagine him walking away from that gig less than a year from hosting a World Cup.",
      "But not impossible. It seems that Pochettino and the United States remain to be convinced by each other, and if United finally make a serious play for the former Spurs, PSG and Chelsea boss, he might be tempted. He might also fancy telling them to shove it after multiple missed opportunities in the past.",
      "Out of sheer curiosity, we would be up for this.",
      "",
      "“I won’t coach in the next year, for sure. I’m certain of that,” said Southgate. A year ago…",
      "The ex-England boss doesn’t spark much excitement among United fans. Actually, we’re not sure he prompts any. But in that respect, he’s in very good company on this dreary list.",
      "His brand of football with England was hardly swashbuckling, but that is not what United need right now. First they have to stiffen up before they can zhuzh it up.",
      "Had his mate Dan Ashworth not been binned after 20 minutes as sporting director, Southgate may already have been fitted for his club blazer. And he is one of very few among the candidates who have experience with the level of scrutiny being United boss brings.",
      "On paper, after his success with England – let’s not pretend his record makes him anything else – Southgate has the credentials. He’s available and, according to his own timetable, he should be good to go. After the tacticians, maybe it’s time for the statesman.",
      "",
      "Xavi has already managed one giant basket case. Quite successfully too. While juggling financial levers, the Catalan guided his boyhood team to the La Liga title in his first full season in charge.",
      "He left after his second, initially of his own accord then the club’s, and Xavi spent last season on sabbatical. The 45-year-old is ready, though, for his next gig having used his break to broaden his coaching horizons.",

      "It looks like Ruben Amorim has picked a fight with the wrong man in Kobbie Mainoo, who’s up on points despite barely raising a fist and won’t need to do much more to land a knockout Manchester United blow.",
      "A video of Pep Guardiola putting his hands on his head as Mainoo diddled Phil Foden before nutmegging Nico Gonzalez to launch a Manchester United attack has been doing the rounds this week, suggesting the Manchester City manager may actually be more appreciative of the 20-year-old’s talents than the man currently in control of his career. And our friends at TEAMtalk reported on Wednesday that that may indeed be the case.",
      "‘TEAMtalk understands that Pep Guardiola, widely regarded as one of the game’s finest tacticians, views Mainoo as one of England’s brightest prospects.",
      "‘While transfers between Man Utd and Man City are rare, Guardiola’s admiration could make this a situation worth monitoring closely.’",
      "Mainoo’s teammates are ‘perplexed’ at him being sidelined by Amorim, Gary Lineker is “really worried” about him being “dismissed” and “baffled” by him not starting, and so too is Owen Hargreaves, who quite rightly said he was United’s “best player by a country mile” having come off the bench at the Etihad.",
      "Amorim believes he’s “helping” Mainoo, but it’s hard to see how and the academy graduate must be similarly confused as to why he’s not playing in a team performing so poorly. Just how bad do they have to be for him to be given a fair chance?",
      "He’s been told by Amorim that it’s either him or Bruno Fernandes, but we refuse to accept that Mainoo – ill-suited or not – would fail to do a better job alongside the Manchester United captain than competition winner Manuel Ugarte. And what has Fernandes done to merit his spot in the team over him other than scoring a last-minute penalty against Burnley?",
      "Mainoo is currently the second biggest stick to beat Amorim with aside from his failing philosophy and formation. It works in Mainoo’s favour with regard to his supporters and champions that his absence from the team is directly linked to that system, and very much against Amorim in the minds of those believing he should be sacked by Manchester United. Not only are they terrible, but there’s no place in the team for someone deemed by many to be the future of the club. It’s not a good look.",
      "United may have been a mess before Amorim arrived, but Mainoo was brilliant, for them and then for England at Euro 2024, and his cameo against City goes to show that very same dynamic, skilful player is still in there.",
      "It remains to be seen whether it’s a performance which will push Amorim to stick him in the starting lineup against Chelsea, but that surely won’t be the case if he sticks to his either/or stance vs Fernandes. He’s not about to drop the United captain.",
      "The obvious suggestion amid United’s poor start to the season and the decision not to grant Mainoo’s wish to leave the club on loan at the end of the transfer window is that he need only wait out Amorim to play regular football again.",
      "Guardiola’s admiration, along with longstanding interest from Chelsea, links to Real Madrid and recent rumours of a January move for his services by Newcastle suggests Amorim is one of very few managers not valuing Mainoo’s quality enough to rely on him as a key cog in a starting lineup.",

      "We can understand why Solskjaer would be seen as an attractive short-term appointment by some fans. What you could never say about his Manchester United is that they weren’t entertaining. His tactics board featured no coloured magnets and simply had ‘United Way’ written on it in permanent marker, with the old ‘go out there and express yourselves’ mantra clearly evident in what was some fantastic football to watch at times. The best since Sir Alex Ferguson.",
      "Sure, “Ole’s at the wheel” was shouted back at them by goading scousers when Liverpool spanked them 5-0 at Old Trafford, but for a fair while the Manchester United fans chanted it with nothing but joy in their hearts at seeing one of their favourite sons leading them by playing a similar – if significantly less polished and gritty – style to that which saw him win nine major trophies in his playing career at Old Trafford.",
      "There’s no chance United would offer him anything but an interim role until the end of the season. Like Lampard upon his return to Chelsea having been sacked by Everton, Solskjaer is currently picking up the pieces of his managerial career after just 29 games in charge of Besiktas. And as evidenced by him not being good enough the first time, there’s only so much benefit to ‘knowing the club’.",
      "United hiring a manager whom they’ve already sacked once would be a bad look. But it wasn’t the INEOS regime that got rid of him and assuming they won’t make the same grave ‘now or never’ ultimatum error to force Amorim to take permanent charge mid-season, we could absolutely see them plumping for an appointment in a bid to get the fans back onside, with that fanciful ‘Manchester United DNA’ so far removed from the current football being played that it’s no longer even part of the ‘what’s wrong with United’ rhetoric.",
      "Solskjaer would also usher in the return of 4-3-3, which may be United’s best bet of getting back into Europe with the current crop of players, many of whom have now taken against Amorim’s doomed formation and philosophy, and would presumably welcome Solskjaer’s – let’s call it fluid – style.",
      "But we would urge Solksjaer when asking himself ‘why wouldn’t I?’ to consider Lampard at Chelsea.",
      "“I’m not getting ahead of myself,” Lampard said when asked about what the future might hold at the end of the 2022/2023 season. “I want to do the best I can to impact the club in this period and we will see what happens afterwards.”",
      "He arrived believing it possible he would be handed a permanent contract. He won one and lost eight of his 11 games in charge and Chelsea scored just nine goals, and left that role with many of us wondering whether that would be that for him in management before showing his worth at Championship level with Coventry.",
      "We imagine Solskjaer is poised for the United call. We can’t imagine a world in which he refuses an offer to return. But while the worst outcome for United would be another terrible season, the worst for him would be the demolition of an already broken reputation, and the best merely a few months of paid work and the Stretford End chanting his name before he’s out on his ear looking for further employment.",
      "Man Utd boss Ruben Amorim is giving the same energy as former Tottenham boss Juande Ramos when “he was trying to get sacked”, says David Bentley.",
      "Newcastle legend Alan Shearer thinks Ruben Amorim is likely to “die on his sword” and could be sacked this weekend if Man Utd lose heavily.",
      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe has flown in for talks with under-pressure Manchester United head coach Ruben Amorim, according to reports.",
      "Ruben Amorim continuing to dare Man Utd to sack him and Liverpool emerging from Arsenal v Manchester City as the biggest winner makes this a big weekend.",
      "Man Utd boss Ruben Amorim should be sacked and replaced by former Red Devils head coach Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, according to reports.",
      "The pressure on Ruben Amorim and his sheer bloody-mindedness means we must consider his replacements. And we’ve talked ourselves on board the Gareth Southgate train…"

      "He has started with a back three in 189 consecutive league games as a head coach since his appointment as Sporting boss in 2020.",
      "His most popular variation is 3-4-2-1, which he has used in 119 of those 189 games, including all four of Manchester United's fixtures in the Premier League so far this season.",
      "He has used a 3-4-3 a total of 68 times, with the only other variation being 3-5-2, which he has used twice since 2020.",
      "His three-at-the-back system brought him great success at Sporting, where he won two Primeira Liga titles in four years and gained a reputation as one of the most exciting managers in Europe. But it has been a different story so far at Manchester United.",
      "Amorim's win rate in league games has plummeted from 77.2 per cent at Sporting to just 25.8 per cent at Manchester United, making it the lowest of any manager in the club's history.",
      "Having taken just 31 points from his 31 games, Manchester United sit bottom among ever-present Premier League teams since his appointment, with twice as many losses (16) as wins (eight).",
      "So how unusual is his system? Data for the last two decades gives a picture of how formations have evolved in the Premier League.",
      "The favoured formation, by a considerable distance, is now 4-2-3-1, with 4-4-2 having dramatically declined in popularity. The 4-3-3 formation has also steadily increased in usage, albeit with a slight drop-off in the last two seasons.",
      "The graph above shows an increase in popularity for Amorim's favoured 3-4-2-1, which was barely used prior to 2015 but became more popular with Chelsea's title win under Antonio Conte in 2016/17.",
      "The formation is now at its peak in terms of usage in the Premier League, although that is largely due to Amorim's devotion to it.",
      "He has used a back three in all of his 31 Premier League games but Crystal Palace and Wolves are the only other sides to have consistently used the system in that timeframe, ensuring Amorim's side remain in a minority in a league dominated by back fours.",
      "Crystal Palace's success under Oliver Glasner, having won the FA Cup last season and qualified for Europe on a modest budget, proves a 3-4-2-1 formation can work in today's Premier League, so why is it not happening for Amorim at Manchester United?",
      "One issue is that they are still struggling to score goals. Despite spending more than £200m on the signings of Bryan Mbeumo, Matheus Cunha and Benjamin Sesko this summer, Amorim's side have only found the net four times in four games so far.",
      "Amorim can feel confident that those players will improve their output as they settle but he needs more from his wing-backs too. Patrick Dorgu and Noussair Mazraoui, his starters at the Etihad Stadium on Sunday, have one Premier League assist and no goals between them in 52 Premier League appearances combined.",
      "The worry is that Amorim doesn't have enough attacking potency among his wing-back options and it is similarly difficult to see an immediate solution to the side's issues out of possession, many of which stem from midfield, where Amorim is now using Bruno Fernandes as part of his two.",
      "Fernandes' incisive passing allows Manchester United to launch quick attacks from the base of midfield but he is now spending less time in the areas in which he is most dangerous. His defensive deficiencies are also being punished routinely.",
      "For Manchester City's first goal on Sunday, Fernandes switched off and left Phil Foden free to head in Jeremy Doku's cross.",
      "The same lack of defensive awareness allowed Emile Smith Rowe to run beyond him and score Fulham's equaliser in the 1-1 draw at Craven Cottage last month, as shown below.",
      "Fernandes is not the only one struggling in Amorim's midfield, with team-mates Casemiro, Manuel Ugarte and Kobbie Mainoo all lacking the athleticism to cope with the demands of the role.",
      "Manchester City's second goal on Sunday, when Ugarte was dragged out of position to make an unsuccessful attempt to press Nico O'Reilly, showed how quickly they can become stretched.",
      "\"They start off really compact, where all 10 players are connected. Five at the back, two midfielders really close to that five, and then the three in front cuddling that two, so they are really protected.",
      "\"But if the game becomes a little stretched, which usually happens if Manchester United concede a goal, then those two look wide open and you can't deny that.\"",
      "\"If you're not brave enough to do that, it's very difficult. They will find the gaps and the spaces to play because we're playing against a top team, we're not playing against a bad opponent.\"",
      "And as Fulham and Burnley have already shown this season, it is not just the top teams who are punishing the weaknesses in Amorim's system. He has no plans to change but does he really have the personnel, either in midfield, or in his back three, or at wing-back, to make it work? Right now, their prospects do not look bright.",
      "We crunched the numbers on Premier League spending in the last edition of Between the Lines, unpicking some of the trends that defined a record-breaking summer transfer window.",

      "Tuesday 16 September 2025 13:03, UK",
      "It is four years ago now that Nicky Butt made headlines for his claim that Declan Rice is no better than Scott McTominay. While Butt acknowledges that the England midfielder has improved since then, there is more respect on McTominay's name now too.",
      "McTominay was the driving force behind Napoli's Serie A title win last season, scoring a dozen goals and winning the competition's player of the year award. It has made a mockery of the notion that he was not good enough to be a Manchester United player.",
      "\"Scott is an amazing person. He is a really great lad.\" Butt, who made 387 appearances for United, including one in the 1999 Champions League final, knows him well. He was an academy coach at United when McTominay broke through. \"He had it tough,\" he adds.",
      "\"He had a lot of growing problems, a lot of injuries.\" That growth spurt has been well documented. \"Back in the day, he was only small and slight.\" But his great strength was his resolve. \"His determination and his drive, you could not ever question,\" says Butt.",
      "\"Scott would be the first to sit here and say he was not the most gifted and talented footballer on the planet, which I wasn't, Roy Keane wasn't. But when you've got that kind of drive, which Scott has and obviously Roy had, you get yourself through the levels.",
      "\"And that is what Scott has done. Scott had the disappointment of leaving Man Utd, I felt that was wrong to let him go because he is one of your own, he would run through brick walls for you, a Manchester United fan from a family of Manchester United fans.\"",
      "McTominay returns to Manchester this week to play against City in the Champions League on Thursday. United themselves are not in European competition. \"It is the same old thing,\" says Butt. \"You don't know what you have got until you've not got it.\"",
      "He adds: \"He is a god in Napoli now. You go there and his picture is on all the walls. It is great. He has earned all that. He has grafted, worked hard, had knockbacks and fair play to him he is a player now. If he'd stayed, he might have stagnated and never got better.\"",
      "Indeed, Butt believes that even the famous Class of '92 would have struggled in the current climate. He made his Premier League debut alongside Bryan Robson in midfield with Steve Bruce and Gary Pallister behind him, Brian McClair and Mark Hughes ahead.",
      "\"Everybody talks about our group,\" says Butt of a crop of talent that included Paul Scholes and David Beckham. \"If we had been brought into this environment now, you would never have heard of us. We would have played seven, eight, nine or 10 games.\"",
      "Why is that? \"We got brought into a football team that was successful with world-class players but more importantly world-class professionals, good men. They made us, really. Trust me, it was more the fact that we had professionals around,\" he explains.",
      "\"When you come into a football club it is hard enough to put one young lad into a team. If you have not got real men to look after you then you will struggle. If we had got into this group now together, we would not have survived, we would have had a nightmare.\"",
      "Nicky Butt came close to making his own move abroad in 2004 when he was a target for Real Madrid. \n\n\n“I had a conversation with the club and they said that if you can find the right club for yourself and Manchester United then you can go. So I started looking around. Carlos Queiroz was Real Madrid manager at the time, he wanted me.”\n\n\nButt went as far as getting a passport sorted for his dog. “I am a big dog man so I made sure they were coming straight away. But it never transpired.” Sir Alex Ferguson decided to block the move.\n\n\n“Player power was not around then but even if it was I was not the kind of bloke to kick up too much of a fuss. I went to Newcastle which was an amazing club and I enjoyed my time there.”",
      "Speaking ahead of the launch of his new podcast with Scholes, The Good, The Bad and The Football, United's ongoing malaise is a recurring theme of the conversation. Having worked in United's academy between 2012 and 2021, Butt saw this unfolding up close.",
      "It remains a source of frustration. \"The worst thing you can do is bury your head in the sand,\" he says of City's rise to become the destination of choice in Manchester. \"Kids saw other clubs coming to them with better facilities. It was a massive pull for them.",
      "\"All over the country, academies upped their game. At Manchester United, we got a bit lacklustre, thinking we were the biggest and the best and did not have to go out and do all the things that the others were doing, but you have to stay on top of your game.\"",
      "Given his prominent role, could he not have arrested that slide himself? \"You're a small cog in a big machine.\" In 2021, he walked away. \"There were things happening at the club where there were people with different philosophies to what I was brought up on.\"",
      "An example. The separation between the academy and the senior players annoyed him. \"Young kids are moving further away from the first team,\" he says. \"I did not agree with the idea that the first team gets everything there and everyone else is on the other side.\"",
      "It was far removed from his own experience as a young player. \"When I was coming into the first team, I knew Brian Robson. I knew Mark Hughes. I knew Peter Schmeichel. I knew Brian McClair. All these superstars that you have on your wall,\" he says.",
      "\"Three years earlier I was at school. But I knew them because I was having dinner with them every day. I was training with them every day. And there was one big family. And when you go into the first team, they know your name and you know how they play.",
      "\"I could not ever imagine playing in front of 75,000 people and not even knowing who these people are. I think they have got to be a lot more together, a lot tighter. And my way, I felt, was changing. That was because other people were coming in from outside.\"",
      "If the sense is of Butt being wistful about United's past, do not mistake him for a sentimentalist. His take on the prospect of the club's proud record of having an academy graduate in every squad for 88 years and counting might just surprise.",
      "\"I'm a bit 50-50 with that. Unless you are bringing players in who are going to play for the club for years, it's pointless because anybody can put someone on the bench from the academy. They don't have to be good enough, it is just to keep the tradition going.",
      "\"If it is someone who you are putting on like Kobbie Mainoo or some of the other names that you can throw about, where you know they are a real player, an international who is going to improve the team and be there for the longevity, then that's brilliant.",
      "\"But if you are just going to bring in little Billy from the under-16s, who is nowhere near the level and you are just doing it to keep the tradition, it can be false, that. It is a bit of a sham. You have to be brave enough to go against the tradition. It will happen one day.\"",
      "United's future remains a fascination. And Butt, one of their own, is not optimistic that Benjamin Sesko can change their fortunes. He argues that it is not fair to expect too much of him. \"I hope he goes and gets the golden boot this year but it is highly unlikely.\"",
      "He is more encouraged by the investment in the training ground. \"The fundamentals of any club have to be solid.\" But how long until the title returns? \"That is the big question, isn't it? My heart says one thing,\" concludes Butt. \"My head says something else.\"",

      "Paul Merson pens his latest column on Ruben Amorim's struggles at Manchester United, Arsenal's Premier League title hopes, Noni Madueke's form, Liverpool's interesting  start to the season and Aston Villa's struggles",
      "Tuesday 16 September 2025 09:46, UK",
      "Paul Merson says Ruben Amorim must adapt his tactics at Manchester United to improve his \"unthinkable\" record.",
      "Also, The Magic Man discusses Arsenal's Premier League title hopes after their 3-0 win over Nottingham Forest and Liverpool's interesting start to the season after Mohamed Salah's late penalty got them out of jail at Burnley.",
      "Read on for Merson's thoughts in full...",
      "Ruben Amorim, the way he wants to play, is a worry.",
      "He won't change. He'll look at it and say 'I've got where I am today by playing the way I play', using three at the back and high wing-backs.",
      "He would have been a perfect fit for Chelsea. They've got world-class wing-backs in Reece James and Malo Gusto, they've got the best holding midfield player in the league in Moises Caicedo. It would fit the players.",
      "You look at Man United and this system does not suit the squad they've got at all. The two wing-backs are nowhere near it, nowhere near good enough. And they are a big part of this formation working. No legs in midfield. Everything is up against him.",
      "You've got to be able to change now and then. You can tweak it, it's horses for courses, that doesn't mean you are abandoning your beliefs.",
      "I don't see them finishing anywhere near it this season, there's too much work to be done. They haven't got the quality.",
      "They were decent against Burnley, but it ends up 2-2 and they need a penalty in the last minute. Their best two players are Mason Mount and Matheus Cunha, they cannot afford to be missed.",
      "He still hasn't won back-to-back games in the league, nearly a year in. That's unthinkable for a club like Man Utd. Unthinkable.",
      "I just wish he would change it every now and then and adapt to the personnel he's got available. It's worrying because he doesn't know his best team, the back three don't even play together every week. He's been there a year, that's a big, big worry.",
      "It's a hard week for Arsenal.",
      "I thought they played really well against Nottingham Forest, a solid result. The performance showed their depth. No Bukayo Saka, Declan Rice was a sub, Martin Odegaard had to go off - it just showed their quality.",
      "If they get through these next couple of weeks, I see them as the team. They are the ones. If they get through these next couple of games, you go advantage Arsenal. They have got ample quality to win the league.",
      "They were very good against Liverpool. That's the most comfortable I've seen an Arsenal team at Anfield in 20 years. If it had ended 0-0 we would be saying 'who is going to touch Arsenal this season?'. Liverpool didn't look like scoring for toffee and then Dominik Szoboszlai scores a worldie from nothing.",
      "Noni Madueke needs to keep on performing, it's only just started.",
      "Arsenal play a certain way, he's been positive, but the way Arsenal play compared to Chelsea will suit him.",
      "Arsenal move the ball quicker, it goes into his feet quicker and then he's one-vs-one in a flash. Chelsea are slower, by the time the ball is moved out to the winger the other side have doubled up. Arsenal don't do that.",
      "He's done outstanding so far - his goal for England against Serbia was really good - better than what I thought. But this has got to go on for the rest of the season. So far, so good.",
      "I'm unsure about Liverpool. They should be mid-table. They've been gifted six points.",
      "They never looked like scoring against Arsenal, Newcastle last kick of the game, then Burnley a penalty in stoppage time. What Hannibal Mejbri is doing there I do not know. You could take six points off Liverpool and no one would have argued. No one would say 'oh that's a bit harsh, they were bang unlucky'. All three should have ended up as draws, and they would be mid-table.",
      "I'm not convinced yet. There is a lot of work for Arne Slot to do. I don't think this Florian Wirtz one is working. I like Wirtz, a terrific player, but teams are sitting back against Liverpool and it's so claustrophobic for him. Their midfield three, for me, won them the league last year. I thought Alexis Mac Allister, Ryan Gravenberch and Szoboszlai were outstanding for long parts, dominating midfields - I don't see that this season. Teams are getting at Liverpool.",
      "Alexander Isak has got to come in, you can have all the best players in the world but if they don't gel, it doesn't work. So they could be mid-table, but you could also say they haven't started playing yet and they have won every game. That's the sign of a very good team.",
      "It's not like Aston Villa have been unlucky, you can't say they have been peppering opposition goals and been unlucky not to score. It's a slow burner. It's shocked me, I thought they would be right up there. It's worrying times.",
      "They will be okay because I think the manager is outstanding, but they have been caught behind. They didn't bring in a forward, Ollie Watkins looks lost. Hopefully one comes off his backside and he goes on a run but Villa don't look like scoring and that's the worry.",
      "They don't look right. A lot of stuff happened in the market - clubs spent, Villa didn't. Marcus Rashford and Marco Asensio were taken away, goals have dried up. And these are players that can make chances for other people as well, they aren't getting those anymore. I look at that Villa team and it doesn't inspire me.",
      "I'm a big fan of Unai Emery, and so if anyone can turn it around, he can.",

      "Ruben Amorim has promised he won’t change his footballing philosophy and his bosses at Manchester United have no plans to change the head coach.",
      "The club has a long-term plan and while there is obvious and growing frustration with results, there will be no knee-jerk reaction or regular reassessment of the head coach's future after every defeat - however loud the noise grows from outside.",
      "Since Sir Alex Ferguson left 12 years ago, there have been two caretakers, and eight 'substantive' bosses. There is no desire to start afresh with a ninth.",
      "With four points from their opening four games, United have endured their worst start to a Premier League season since 1992/93. They also went out of the Carabao Cup - one of only three competitions they had the chance to win in 2025-26 - against Grimsby Town of League Two.",
      "This, after last season which saw their lowest ever Premier League points tally (42), and their most Premier League defeats (15).",
      "It is painful to watch. Amorim acknowledges and understands the supporters are hurting, but he says he is suffering still more as he battles to turn things around.",
      "He knows that his bosses are patient, and that they are realistic in their assessment that there are no quick fixes at Old Trafford. But there is also a recognition on all sides that currently things are far from good enough.",
      "There is no doubt Pep Guardiola's team definitively deserved the victory, and there is dismay at the three goals United conceded - with Erling Haaland's second a particularly tough one to swallow after the visitors vacated their entire defensive half to allow the Norwegian striker to run through unchecked.",
      "But there is pragmatism in the Old Trafford boardroom too recognising that, had Bryan Mbeumo's wondrous volley not been met with an equally wonderful Gianluigi Donnarumma save when the score was 2-0, or had Casemiro not missed a sitter at the back post later on in the game - there might have been a better gloss to the result.",
      "Amorim and the United hierarchy feel they are losing out on the fine margins right now.",
      "There are other mitigating circumstances too - the injuries to Mason Mount and Matheus Cunha are particularly damaging, especially because United's squad doesn't have the strength in depth of any of the other \"Big Six\" clubs right now.",
      "It will take several transfer windows and clever recruitment before that is a reality. Mount and Cunha should both be back available soon.",
      "Benjamin Sesko is still adapting to life in the Premier League, but there is optimism that he is beginning to feel more comfortable - albeit with very limited service. That was his first Premier League start for United on Sunday.",
      "Amorim's stubbornness over his playing system - with a defiant three centre backs - is very much a live debate. \"When I want to change my philosophy, I will change,\" the manager said on Sunday evening. \"If not, you have to change the man.\"",
      "It is not the first time that he has effectively said \"back me or sack me\" in front of the media. But when Amorim was appointed in November last year, the United hierarchy knew what they were getting, and the specific way in which the Portuguese coach chooses to play.",
      "There remains a belief, beyond Amorim's coaching staff, that the system can be a success.",
      "But there is some consternation that, with United's midfield struggling to hold its own so far this season, Amorim is repeatedly overlooking the talent of Kobbie Mainoo.",
      "The midfielder looked bright when he came off the bench for the last 30 minutes against City, and that again has prompted many a United fan to ask why he is yet to start a Premier League game this season.",
      "What is clear is that Amorim doesn't think he is the finished article and that, at 20-years-old, he still needs to develop. The United boss is working hard and personally with Mainoo behind the scenes, but rightly or wrongly - Mainoo's involvement will be managed. He is not currently in Amorim's first-choice line-up.",
      "For the Manchester United bosses, they feel little has changed after this weekend's game against their bitter rivals. That is not to say they will wait for change indefinitely. Rather, they accept that correcting United's malaise is a long-term project.",
      "And there is little or no desire to rip up the current plan, change the man in charge of the football team, and start (again) from scratch.",
      "Club legends are lining up to say enough is enough - Wayne Rooney, Roy Keane, Gary Neville and more among the voices saying the pressure on Amorim is mounting, and things have to improve quickly.",
      "That is true. And no one knows it more acutely than Ruben Amorim himself."

      "\"But he is being asked to do something different. It is normal for a No 10 like he is to be able to do it for two or three games, to fill in when a midfielder is injured or suspended or something. But then you get a little bit bored of going back into position to defend.\"",
      "It is the voice of experience. \"I did both roles. As a No 10, the last thing you want to think about is defending. Once you go back into a two in midfield, all of a sudden you are thinking about defence, about what your runner is doing. It's a totally different mindset.\"",
      "There is a view now that Scholes was a natural deep-lying playmaker, England's answer to Andrea Pirlo or Xavi Hernandez. It is true that he took on that role late in his career but, now 50 and reflecting on his career, it is not necessarily how he sees himself.",
      "\"When I first came into the team I was a centre-forward,\" he recalls. And while Sir Alex Ferguson had always insisted that he would end up playing as a central midfielder, that took time. \"I ended up playing as a No 10 for three, four, five years, which I loved.\"",
      "They were some of his happiest and most successful years. \"Defending was not my strong point. I didn't like having to think about defending and as a No 10 you didn't have to. All you think about is getting your team to play, creating chances, scoring goals.\"",
      "In truth, the obsession with possession was never his. When watching old clips, he has been known to groan at the sight of himself passing backwards. \"It was not until my late twenties when I went into that controlling role as the manager wanted me to do.\"",
      "It required a mentality shift. \"I remember a game against Bayern Munich in the Champions League where he did not really want me to go over the halfway line, which was something different for me, because we were getting done in Europe quite a bit.\"",
      "Scholes' job was not to unlock the opposition but to stifle them. \"He wanted us to just be controlled and not vacate that area. It was something new for me to learn.\" Even now, he still recalls his surprise at the United manager's reaction to his performance.",
      "\"I remember after that game, I had not had a shot on goal and I don't think I created a chance. I didn't do anything attacking wise very well. He said, 'Brilliant, that is what I wanted from you'. From that day on, it just seemed to grow. I became used to the role.\"",
      "As such, you might expect Scholes to be an advocate for Fernandes making the same positional journey. The United skipper turned 31 this month, after all. Instead, it seems he would prefer the Portuguese playmaker to be the one still trying that killer pass.",
      "\"That is the way I was brought up. That is the way the manager wanted us to play. Pass forward and run forward. It was all about playing attacking, being entertaining. So, to go back, just passing it back, I hate seeing it now and I hated seeing it when I did it.\"",
      "In a wide-ranging conversation at a Manchester pub where he is even volunteering to pull pints to help promote his new podcast The Good, the Bad and the Football with fellow Class of '92 graduate Nicky Butt, Scholes touches on subjects old and new.",
      "He has been following the debate about the relative merits of Michael Owen and Wayne Rooney as teenagers. Scholes played with both. Owen even nicked the ball off his toe when scoring his wonder goal against Argentina in 1998. \"He could have left it for me.\"",
      "His own view? Succinct but definitive. \"At that age, Michael was the better goalscorer, Wayne was the better footballer.\"",
      "But he is keen to stress that Owen was a phenomenon in his own right, his pace setting him apart from the rest. \"With Michael in the early days, I just had to look and he would spin in behind and I just had to hit the ball into 20 yards of space. It was an easy job.\"",
      "Easy for Scholes, perhaps. He had a connection with many top-class strikers for club and country. \"As a midfield player you need to know your players' strengths.\" But Ruud van Nistelrooy was his favourite. \"I had the feeling that I knew what he wanted to do.\"",
      "Scholes wonders whether too much is being expected of the latest United striker Benjamin Sesko. Will he really be able to succeed where Rasmus Hojlund failed? \"He is a 22-year-old kid replacing someone of a very similar ilk. It is a difficult job to adapt.\"",
      "He would have liked the club to opt for a more experienced goalkeeper such as Emiliano Martinez too. \"He would have been a lot safer.\" And that is crucial. Scholes saw up close the difficulties that the club faced in trying to find a replacement for Peter Schmeichel.",
      "He is reluctant to criticise Massimo Taibi too much. \"He made a couple of mistakes. It did not work out.\" But he is less delicate on Mark Bosnich's footwork. \"Would he be able to play in this day and age for some of the best coaches in the world? I don't see it.\"",
      "On United more broadly, Scholes describes himself as \"more hopeful than confident\" that Amorim can bring the good times back. \"I like the way he speaks,\" he says, before later adding: \"The results are not really there to have massive confidence in him yet.\"",
      "Perhaps he would have more confidence if Fernandes were given more freedom to express himself further forwards. \"If you watched some of the Europa League games last year, he was really good in that [deeper] position so he can do it,\" says Scholes.",
      "\"I think if you asked him to do everything then he would try to do it all, almost in that Wayne Rooney type of way as well. But I think with him playing in that deeper-lying area it is taking away some of the important qualities that he has further up the pitch.\"",

      "Patrick Dorgu's role in the derby was fascinating. He had more touches in the opposition penalty box than any other player on the pitch. In fact, with 12 touches there, he became the first United player to hit double figures in the area so far this season.",
      "So often the space was his. But he was not particularly effective. There was one completed dribble. Crosses were looped in. But even late in the game, with City having long since sealed the points, there was a toothlessness to United in the final third.",
      "It seems extraordinary to think that this is by design but that is how it can feel with Amorim's United. So much depends on the quality of the wing-backs in this system but even though Dorgu is seen as a specialist in the role, does he have the tools required?",
      "Two seasons ago, the player to find themselves in the most one-on-one situations in the Premier League was Arsenal's Bukayo Saka. Last season, it was Liverpool's Mohamed Salah. This suits those teams. Get your best player isolated against the opposition.",
      "The United player to have found themselves in the most one-on-one situations is Dorgu. If that is the plan with Amorim's 3-4-3 then it is a concern because on Sunday that is probably the United player Pep Guardiola would have wanted to have the space.",
      "Any system that compromises the strengths of your most talented players and highlights the deficiencies of your most limited ones is surely doomed to fail. For Amorim, the wing-backs are key. And Manchester United's are not good enough to make this work.",
      "For proof that isolating a wide player against the opposition defence can be effective, look no further than the other end of the pitch and a hugely impactful performance by Jeremy Doku who provided assists for Manchester City's first two goals of the game.",
      "Jack Grealish's improved end product has been a feature of the Premier League season, racking up four assists already since joining Everton on loan from Manchester City. But Doku's impressive display in the Manchester derby was a reminder of his talent.",
      "The Belgian forced himself ahead of Grealish in the mind of Pep Guardiola and certainly justified his inclusion against Manchester United. It was Doku's skill that opened up the defence for Phil Foden's opening goal, dancing past two opponents to set it up.",
      "Guardiola has described the winger as the best in the world over five metres and that explosivity was the key factor in that goal but the City boss has urged him to improve other facets of his game and there was some evidence of that with his second assist.",
      "It was his measured pass through to Erling Haaland that ended any hopes of a United comeback. It is the first time that Doku has registered two assists in a Premier League game since producing four of them in one game against Bournemouth in 2023.",
      "Grealish, who had a season-high 16 touches in the opposition box in Everton's goalless draw with Aston Villa, still ranks second for chances created from open play in the Premier League so far this season, but the one man ahead of him on that list is Doku.",
      "The return of the long throw remains a big talking point in this Premier League season but after Crystal Palace found the net as a result of one against Aston Villa before the international break, it was time for the masters of it to make their own statement.",
      "Brentford's stoppage-time equaliser against Chelsea was finished by Fabio Carvalho but it came from a Kevin Schade long throw. According to the expected-goals data, the Bees have now created better chances from throw-ins than any other team this season.",
      "No surprise there. That was the case last season, and the season before that, and the season before that, and the season before that. Other teams are finally cottoning on to the fact that the throw-in is an opportunity to do more than just recycle possession.",
      "\"It is not new to us,\" said Brentford boss Keith Andrews. How true. Over the past five seasons, their expected-goals tally from throw-ins is 21.47. The next best in the Premier League in that period is just 5.49 by Nottingham Forest. The rest are playing catch up.",
      "Speaking recently to Thomas Gronnemark, the renowned throw-in specialist who has worked with Brentford for the past three seasons, he believes that this is inevitable because paying attention to the importance of this set piece just makes sense.",
      "Super 6 are starting the season by guaranteeing a £1,000,000 winner! Play for free."

      "Monday 15 September 2025 12:01, UK",
      "This is as bad as it gets unless you were watching Man Utd in the 1970s when they were relegated.",
      "Here's the thing, though, United fans who were there have great memories of that 1974/75 season in the Second Division. Tommy Docherty was in charge and there were new grounds to visit.",
      "The team still had players you could look up to like Stuart Pearson, Lou Macari, Sammy McIlroy and Brian Greenhoff. Despite playing in the second tier United still had the highest average home attendance in England.",
      "After an instant return to the First Division, United also denied Liverpool the Treble a year later by beating Bob Paisley's side in the 1977 FA Cup final.",
      "Even in the 1980s when United went through long dark periods, they still had teams full of club legends like Bryan Robson, Norman Whiteside, Mark Hughes and Paul McGrath.",
      "In recent years there have been so many changes at every level of the club that it's difficult to put your finger on what makes United that special anymore.",
      "Of course, there is the history and the trophies and the fans. More than 2.2m of them watched games at Old Trafford last season. There wasn't much to celebrate with United finishing 15th in the Premier League, but that made them the best supported team in Europe.",
      "Many of those fans will not have been around in the 1970s and 1980s so for them this is definitely as bad as it gets. And that's a view that would probably be shared by at least some of the older fans who were there in those days.",
      "Ruben Amorim was defiant in Sunday's post-match press conference after his side's 3-0 defeat to Man City, and made it clear, again, that he is not going to change his philosophy.",
      "No matter how bad things get, it seems he will carry on playing three at the back even though it is pretty obvious to everyone that the system is not working and it does not suit his players.",
      "If nobody at United can convince him to be more flexible, then they just have to hope the players will eventually look at home playing the way Amorim wants them to play.",
      "The only other option is to replace the head coach, but that it is a road United have been down too often since Sir Alex Ferguson stepped down 12 years ago.",
      "You could make a pretty good case that United would be in a better state if they had stuck with any of the managers who followed Ferguson: David Moyes, Louis van Gaal, Jose Mourinho, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and Erik ten Hag.",
      "Although, judging by the fact that they wasted so much money in the transfer market when Ten Hag was in charge, perhaps it was the right decision to sack him nine months ago, when United were 14th - exactly where did they are today.",
      "Even Ten Hag, though, could point out that since Amorim's first game in charge, no ever-present Premier League team have performed worse than United - 31 points from 31 games means United are bottom of the table.",
      "Not if he only has one way of playing.",
      "The Premier League is ferociously competitive and United are too easy to play against at the moment. Opponents know exactly what to expect when they face United and the fear factor has totally disappeared.",
      "It used to be a shock when United lost; now it is a shock when they win. So-called smaller clubs are better run, have better balanced squads and can spend tens of millions of pounds on players every summer.",
      "United have been left behind and Amorim has a massive job on his hands. He is a man who wears his heart on his sleeve and comes across as extremely honest and transparent in all his dealings with the media. That is a breath of fresh in one sense, but it can also diminish his status as a strong leader.",
      "Managing Manchester United is like managing Real Madrid. Everything you say is going to be a headline. United are back-page news every day.",
      "Perhaps the ideal United head coach is someone who wears a suit and tie and gives little away. It worked in the old days, but these are not the old days any more.",
      "It is too early to answer that question properly because the window closed only two weeks ago.",
      "United focused their spending on buying a new forward line when many outside observers would have thought that the money would have been better spent on a new spine for the team. They also had the option of selling Bruno Fernandes for a big transfer fee to Al Hilal in Saudi Arabia.",
      "The captain stayed and his new team-mates Benjamin Sesko, Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo need to be given more time to show what they can do. Senne Lammens could also turn out to be an exceptional goalkeeper if he lives up to expectations and adapts to English football.",
      "There is a nagging feeling, though, that a club the size and stature of United should be going all out to buy the best players in the world - players like Gianluigi Donnarumma.",
      "Not being in the Champions League and cutting the wage bill means United fans have to get used to a new reality, a new reality which means the very best players going to their rivals for the time being.",
      "Even the fact that United managed to move out so many players this summer who were surplus to requirements was not a cause for celebration. United have taken a big financial hit on the transfer fees paid for the likes of Rasmus Hojlund, Jadon Sancho and Antony but at least they were able to get their wages off their books.",
      "United were sixth in the table when INEOS completed their deal to buy their minority stake and take over sporting control in February last year.",
      "There has been very little to get excited about on the pitch, apart from a shock FA Cup final win against Manchester City, which earned Ten Hag a new contract but left United counting the cost - some £13m - when they fired him just five months later.",
      "There's no point going through all the statistics and defeats here - there are too many losses - but it is safe to say that this has been one of the worst periods in the history of the club.",
      "INEOS have put their own money in and are making big changes off the pitch, including redeveloping the training ground, but there have been just as many mistakes as good decisions. With the benefit of hindsight, flying to Ibiza to give Ten Hag a new deal was absolutely the wrong decision and hiring and firing Dan Ashworth was another costly mistake.",
      "At least INEOS have a plan. The plan changes from time to time as all plans do, but they do have a plan and they have put their own money on the table. It is just extremely unfortunate that the plan has also meant so many people losing their jobs and a new controversial ticketing policy.",
      "The Glazer family also had a plan and if you wanted to start an argument, you could whisper very quietly that the results, league tables and trophies, taken in isolation, show that United were better off when the Glazers and executives like Ed Woodward and Richard Arnold were in charge.",
      "The priority has to be getting back into the Champions League or any European competition at the very least.",
      "The League Cup is already gone thanks to that calamitous night in Grimsby and you can get odds of 100/1 on United to win the title so, trophy wise, the FA Cup is all United realistically have to play for.",
      "Winning the FA Cup would mean a place in the Europa League, but the Champions League is where United have to be. The commercial benefits of being back in the expanded top-tier European tournament are huge and it would make it easier to sign the best players in the world.",
      "Finishing in the top five is likely to mean Champions League qualification but United are a long way off that standard at the moment. At least the lack of European competition this season means Amorim has more time to work with his players in between league games. It is not much of a silver lining, but it is something at least.",
      "United's next game is against Chelsea next weekend. Luckily for them, Chelsea have a terrible record at Old Trafford - no league win for 12 years - and they were not particularly convincing in their 2-2 draw with Brentford on Saturday night.",
      "The six teams below United at the moment are all capable of beating them but that is not to say United are in a relegation fight - yet.",
      "If they carry on the way they have started, they will probably end up where they finished last season - in the middle of the bottom half of the table.",
      "And if that is the case, it is likely that INEOS will make a change at the top - just as they did last October when United were 14th."
