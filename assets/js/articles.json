      "Manchester United are planning to launch a £60million move for Crystal Palace star Adam Wharton, with club bosses believing a bid in that region would be good enough to tempt the Eagles to sell their sought-after playmaker.",
      "The Red Devils were unable to strengthen their midfield last summer despite it being one of their priorities, but they have plans to do so ahead of next season with Ruben Amorim's preferred pairing of Casemiro and Bruno Fernandes coming under scrutiny this season.",
      "Amorim has kept close tabs on Wharton's progress at Selhurst Park and has become a huge fan of the midfielder, per The Daily Star. And the Portuguese coach is said to believe the talented 21-year-old has the technical abilities to be a huge success at United.",
      "The report adds that both Kobbie Mainoo and Casemiro are expected to leave Old Trafford. The former has not made a Premier League start this term and could move to Napoli on loan in January, while Casemiro is out of contract next year.",
      "Wharton is one of the most sought-after talents in the Premier League following a remarkable rise in the last two years. United's target became one of Blackburn's top stars before joining Crystal Palace from the Lancashire club for £18m in February 2024. Wharton quickly settled into the Premier League and earned a spot in Gareth Southgate's squad for the Euros that summer.",
      "And the midfield ace has earned an integral role under Oliver Glasner at Palace as they earned FA Cup success and qualified for European football. Wharton's reputation only continues to grow.",
      "United opted to spend £200m on their forward line this summer, adding Benjamin Sesko, Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha to their squad in an attempt to solve their goalscoring woes. And now early work is being planned to tempt Palace into letting go their most promising star, after he was already linked to a move in August.",
      "The Eagles have proven willing to part ways with their top talent for the correct price. Over the summer, they sold Eberechi Eze to Arsenal in a £67.5m deal , while Michael Olise departed for Bayern Munich 12 months before.",
      "Amorim could find himself short a midfielder before the end of the season. Napoli are confident of landing Mainoo, who like Wharton enjoyed a meteoric rise for a place at Euro 2024, on loan in January.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Harry Maguire is ready to snub a £500k-a-week deal to move to Saudi Arabia to stay at Manchester United - if they offer him a new contract.",
      "Maguire is out of contract in June and, as revealed last week, has become a target of Saudi outfits Al-Nassr and Al-Ettifaq.",
      "The veteran England defender will be free to open talks with clubs in January, and a move to the Middle East could see him land a mega-money contract as he enters the twilight of his career. Maguire turns 33 in March.",
      "There is a temptation on the player's part to cash in on what would be the last lucrative move of his career - particularly if United stick by their decision to look to the future and don't offer him a new contract. They took up the option in Maguire's current contract last summer, something he, ultimately, didn't have a choice in.",
      "But new suggestions are that United are indeed considering handing the defender a contract extension. Talks will take place in the coming weeks, but Maguire will want assurances the deal is right for him.",
      "Maguire knows joining the Saudi Pro-League would damage his chances of extending his England career, whether that's under Thomas Tuchel - if he continues after next summer - or a new boss.",
      "And if he pledges his future to United, he wants to know he will remain an integral pat of the club's plans, whoever is the manager.",
      "In an ideal world, Maguire would be willing to see out the rest of his career at Old Trafford. But he is mindful the next deal he signs will be the last major one of his career, and the terms would have to be right.",

      "On Wednesday, he posted on X: \"The best news I heard today is that Manchester United is now in an advanced stage of completing a deal to sell to a new investor... I hope he's better than the previous owners.\" Discussion of a complete club buyout predictably commenced following such a substantial assertion, though the chairman of Saudi Arabia's General Entertainment Authority subsequently clarified his comments the following day.",

      "A talkSPORT report has provided additional insight into the mystery backer, or potential backers, with the group Al-Sheikh is referencing believed to be UAE-based.",
      "It has also been claimed that several club legends have been 'approached' regarding possibly investing in United. The Glazers have recently shown openness to minority investment, though a full sale of the club seems unlikely due to their hefty £5billion asking price.",
      "A comprehensive report from The Athletic supports the notion that a complete takeover is unlikely until after 2026.",
      "This is due to the current share prices for a stake in United, with Sir Jim Ratcliffe having paid $33 per share and a 'drag-along rights' mechanism being triggered 18 months after his purchase.",
      "This prevents him from blocking a full takeover if that's what the Glazers desire.",
      "This clause also affects a potential sale if it is sought before February 2027, as Ratcliffe would need to receive the full amount he paid.",
      "However, after this date, the Glazers can accept any offer, potentially resulting in the Ineos chief losing millions.",
      "Given these circumstances, it's more probable that any potential investors will hold off until after this date to pay less, as the price per share will be significantly lower.",

      "Rashford's performances and form at Barcelona are catching the eyes of other clubs in Europe, and even Paris Saint-Germain were linked after they met in the Champions League. However, Rashford is focused on playing well enough to secure a permanent move to Barcelona next summer, as it was his dream to play for the Catalan club when he left Old Trafford.",
      "Barcelona boss Hansi Flick has praised Rashford publicly and the 27-year-old has also impressed England boss Thomas Tuchel while on international duty. The United loanee came on as a second-half substitute in Thursday's thumping 3-0 win against Wales.",
      "Rashford will hope to start Tuesday's trip to Latvia, in which England can seal qualification for the World Cup if results go their way. He's been in red-hot form since the last international break, having scored in the 5-0 victory in Serbia.",
      "In his last eight games for club and country, Rashford has contributed four goals and four assists. His latest strike came in Barca's shock 4-1 defeat away to Sevilla, as the La Liga champions surrendered their grip on first place.",
      "Flick hailed Rashford's performance after he scored twice in the Champions League to help Barcelona beat Newcastle 2-1 at St James' Park last month. \"I am not surprised [by his goals],\" Flick said post-match. \"I think he's a fantastic player. His skills are unbelievable and his finishing is unbelievable.",
      "\"I think also in the first half, he tried to create chances, but the finishing wasn't there. In the second half it was. For a striker, it's always good to score. I am really happy.",

      "Rashford added: \"I'm learning a lot, it's a new style of football,\" and \"But it's making me a better player. Honestly, it's an amazing experience. I've always been a huge admirer of Barcelona, every player my age has watched them play, it's amazing football.\"",
      "Barca's sporting director, Deco, recently told Mundo Deportivo: \"There's no penalty clause in the loan agreement if we don't sign him. We do have an option to make it permanent if we want to.

      "Manchester United captain Bruno Fernandes has admitted that he needs to 'study better' after his woes from the penalty spot this season. Fernandes, 31, has taken three penalties since the new Premier League campaign began but he's only scored one.",
      "That was a stoppage-time winner against Burnley to seal a 3-2 win that some believe saved Red Devils manager Ruben Amorim's job. But the week before during the 1-1 draw at Fulham, Fernandes blazed his spot-kick over the bar, having bumped into the referee during his preparation.",
      "Last month, Fernandes had the chance to level the scores in United's trip to Brentford. But his effort was saved by Caoimhin Kelleher, as the Red Devils suffered a 3-1 defeat.",
      "Fernandes is set to come up against Kelleher on Saturday when Portugal take on the Republic of Ireland in World Cup qualifying. The midfielder was asked about his penalty record in a press conference and replied: \"This season, out of three, I ended up missing two.",
      "\"I don't want to miss any of them. It's something I need to study better. I'll always do it with full conviction because there's a coach who trusts me.\"",
      "Although he's unlikely to take a penalty against Kelleher, given that Cristiano Ronaldo is his team-mate for Portugal, Fernandes was asked about facing the Brentford goalkeeper once again. \"Every day is a good day to settle scores,\" the United star added.",
      "\"He was stronger. He did very well, and I didn't. But it's not something that affects my head. In a football team, there's something bigger than individuality. Winning is much more important than settling scores with the Irish goalkeeper.\"",
      "Fernandes was also quizzed on his future at Old Trafford. The 31-year-old was the subject of interest from Saudi Arabia in the summer transfer window, with Al-Hilal ready to launch a £100million bid and give Fernandes a contract worth £200m.",
      "He rejected their advances and stayed at United, where he's under contract until 2027. \"I didn't close the door on moving to Saudi Arabia because of the World Cup,\" Fernandes affirmed.",
      "\"That was never in my mind. I wanted to stay at Manchester United, and the club wanted me to stay. That's all there is to it.",
      "\"I like to enjoy the moment, and the most important thing for me now is representing the national team, because it's a source of enormous pride to be able to play tomorrow [Saturday], and I still don't know if I'll play, let alone if I'll leave Manchester United in a year. I'm happy where I am; otherwise, I wouldn't have stayed, but it's something that doesn't affect me.\"",

      "Former Premier League striker Matt Jansen has no regrets about turning down Manchester United on two separate occasions. Jansen was amongst English football's brightest prospects in the early 2000s and looked destined for the 2002 World Cup before Sven-Goran Eriksson made a late decision to take an additional defender, Martin Keown, instead.",
      "Later that summer, he sustained life-threatening injuries in a scooter accident while holidaying in Rome. Although he made a comeback to the game, Jansen was never quite the same player. He eventually dropped down the levels before transitioning into coaching, managing non-league Chorley before joining Stockport County, where he is now assistant first-team coach.",
      "During his playing days, Jansen turned down two chances to join Sir Alex Ferguson's dominant side. The first opportunity arose while he was at hometown club Carlisle, then under the ownership of Michael Knighton, the businessman who almost bought the Red Devils in the late 1980s.",
      "Jansen remembered being \"touted around\" alongside fellow prospect Rory Delap by Knighton and spent a week training with the Old Trafford club. He was then presented with a straightforward choice between United and Crystal Palace, opting for the Eagles as it guaranteed more first-team opportunities.",
      "\"My father gave Michael Knighton an ultimatum: give me a new contract or sell me,\" he said in association with Palentir Financial Planning.",
      "\"He came back to us and said the two biggest bids had come in from Palace and Manchester United, £1m plus add-ons. The decision was over to me.",
      "\"I'd just broken into the first team at Carlisle. I was loving the adulation and buzz from playing first-team football. I thought I'd have a better chance of continuing that at Palace, so opted for them over United.\"",
      "However, as Jansen's star rose in south London, Palace found themselves in dire straits both on and off the pitch. He was told he was crucial to the Eagles' survival when larger clubs, including United, showed interest.",
      "Jansen was advised that choosing Blackburn would be financially beneficial for the struggling club. He recalled: \"I loved playing in the Premier League for them but unfortunately we went down. The club then got sold. It was a whirlwind of an experience.",
      "\"Terry Venables came in [as manager], Mark Goldberg bought the club off Ron Noades. But the money dried up and I became an asset they needed to cash in on.",
      "\"I came in one morning and [manager] Steve Coppell said to me, 'You're not playing today, we've accepted a £5m bid from Juventus. I was like 'Wow!' I was buzzing with that. The next minute it was Chelsea, Newcastle, Arsenal and again Manchester United, all £5m bids. I had a choice to make.",
      "\"At the 11th hour, Blackburn came in. Jack Walker [Blackburn's owner] said he would pay £4.1m but he was going to pay it all up front. Palace told me it would have saved the club. I don't know if it would have saved the club or not, but they asked me if I would be willing to go there.\"",
      "At that point, Blackburn were a well-established Premier League outfit who had pipped United to the title just a few seasons prior. Jansen explained: \"Brian Kidd [Ferguson's long-time assistant at United] had become manager. I knew him from my week training at United.",
      "\"So to help Crystal Palace out, I opted to go to Blackburn, which I don't regret. I loved it there. Unfortunately, we got relegated and Brian got the sack. In came Graeme Souness. He steadied the ship and we got promoted.\"",
      "Jansen subsequently helped Blackburn to League Cup glory in 2002, netting the opener before setting up Andy Cole's winner in a 2-1 victory over Tottenham in Cardiff.",
      "Jansen harbours no regrets about rejecting United and passing up the opportunity to play under Ferguson. He said: \"At Crystal Palace, I was playing first-team football and was quickly turning heads with Juventus, Arsenal, Newcastle and United again [showing interest].",
      "\"I loved my time at Blackburn. My career was progressing and, who knows, if I hadn't had the accident, the time may have come for me to go to Manchester United.",
      "\"At that time, it was just too soon [to go to United] I thought, so I decided to go to Palace. And going to Blackburn was the right decision. The wrong decision was getting on a scooter in Rome!\"",

      "An ex-Chelsea player dubbed 'the world's richest footballer' is one of a minimal few who possess the financial capabilities to buy Manchester United from the Glazers. Faiq Bolkiah, who is the nephew of the Sultan of Brunei, has forged a career in football despite his unfathomable net worth of around £15billion.",
      "The 27-year-old spent time in the youth academies of Southampton and the Blues, before enjoying a four-year stint with Leicester City but left in 2020 without making a first-team appearance.",
      "It was that same year that Bolkiah signed his first professional contract with Maritimo. After making just two appearances for the Portuguese club, he made the move to Thailand with Chonburi and since 2023, he's represented Thai League 1 side Ratchaburi.",
      "His determination to carve a career for himself in the sport given his family wealth is certainly admirable considering he could hypothetically cough up the £5.2bn the Glazer family are said to want to green-light a sale for the Red Devils. There is, of course, no suggestion that he is interested in doing any such thing.",
      "While United's current value stands at £2bn, the Floridian businessmen are thought to want double that figure. The significant premium could be based on future increases in the club's value such as plans for their new stadium. Speculation about the future of United arose earlier this week when Saudi billionaire Turki Al-Sheikh stoked the fires on social media.",
      "Al-Sheikh, who is the chairman of the General Entertainment Authority in Saudi Arabia, took to X to claim a new investor is close to making a deal with the club. He wrote: \"The best news I heard today is that Manchester United is now in an advanced stage of completing a deal to sell to a new investor ... I hope he's better than the previous owners.\"",
      "Amid excitement online over the potential departure of the Glazer family, who've been subject to many protests from the United fanbase during their 20-year reign at Old Trafford, Al-Sheikh later confirmed that he was not the investor.",
      "He explained in another post: \"My yesterday’s post about Manchester United's potential sale meant one thing: the club is in an advanced negotiation phase with a new investor. Just to clarify, I am not the investor, nor are they from my nation. I'm posting this as a fan who wishes the deal to happen, though it might not necessarily happen.\"",
      "The Glazers took over United in 2005 in a deal worth £790million. It was in 2023 that they sold 25% of the club to Sir Jim Ratcliffe before the British billionaire increased his minority ownership to 28.9% in a total deal worth a hefty £1.25bn.",
      "While the Glazers remain majority owners, Ratcliffe admitted during his appearance on the The Business podcast that if he was instructed by the Americans to sack Ruben Amorim, he'd refuse.",
      "\"He has not had the best of seasons,\" Ratcliffe said. \"Ruben needs to demonstrate he is a great coach over three years. That’s where I would be.\"",

      "Bruno Fernandes has revealed that next summer's World Cup played no part in his decision to stay at Manchester United. The Red Devils captain was linked to a big-money move to Saudi Arabia during the summer but the midfielder insists that his only thought was to stick with his current club, even in light of fresh rumours.",
      "Potential bids from Al-Hilal and Al-Ittihad have been speculated upon, but the Portugal international remains committed to at least another year at Old Trafford. Fernandes, 31, has two seasons left on his contract, with an option to extend for a further 12 months, and he remains a key player for Ruben Amorim.",
      "In June, Fernandes revealed that the president of Al-Hilal called him over a deal. The Saudi side were said to be willing to cough up a £300million package - £100m for United and a £200m contract for the playmaker.",
      "The former Sporting star has endured a mixed season thus far after two penalty misses, but was a rare plus in a dismal 2024-25 season at Old Trafford. Fernandes still has two goals to his name this term, however.",
      "And ahead of Portugal's World Cup qualifier against the Republic of Ireland, the midfielder addressed the speculation surrounding his future. Fernandes gave a simple answer on his decision to stay with United.",
      "\"I didn't close the door on moving to Saudi Arabia because of the World Cup,\" he stated. \"That was never in my mind. I wanted to stay at Manchester United, and the club wanted me to stay. That's all there is to it.\"",
      "Fernandes refused to engage in conversation over the possibility of departing next summer. Nothing appears imminent for the moment.",
      "\"That's an impossible scenario to imagine, because it's nothing that's been discussed with me,\" he said. \"When it was discussed with me, I spoke openly with you at a press conference before a Nations League match.",
      "\"I like to enjoy the moment, and the most important thing for me now is representing the national team, because it's a source of enormous pride to be able to play tomorrow [Saturday], and I still don't know if I'll play, let alone if I'll leave Manchester United in a year.",
      "\"I'm happy where I am; otherwise, I wouldn't have stayed, but it's something that doesn't affect me.\"",
      "Fernandes will hope to start Portugal's World Cup qualifying clash against the Republic of Ireland on Saturday evening. The Nations League champions hold a perfect record so far in Group F after wins over Armenia and Hungary to open their campaign to reach North America next summer.",
      "\"We have to take it game by game, even though we know we want to reach the World Cup as quickly as possible,\" the 31-year-old told Channel 11 via O Jogo. \"Our main goal is to win every game, and we’re focused on that, knowing that the dream of the World Cup is always present.",
      "\"Since I was little, I've dreamed of winning the World Cup, and it’s not just my dream, it's the dream of all Portuguese people. First, we’ll do everything we can to be there, and then we'll do everything we can to make that dream come true.\"",

      "Gareth Southgate spoke at the 11th Aspire Academy Global Summit in the US this week. The 55-year-old has been out of a managerial job since stepping down from England after Euro 2024 last summer.",
      "However, he has evidently kept busy in the year since. The Aspire Academy Global Summit brings people from all walks of professional football together to share their wisdom on the game.",
      "This year's event was hosted in Philadelphia, as Southgate was joined by the likes of Rafael Benitez - who presented a master class - as well as Carli Lloyd, Wilfried Nancy and Alessandro Nesta, among others. Speaking at the summit, Southgate said: \"The most important thing for developing football is developing coaches.",
      "\"We are all constantly learning. Bringing people together to share experiences and ideas helps us all grow, especially as the game continues to evolve.\"",
      "It comes as Southgate has been linked with taking up tenure at Manchester United in the event that Ruben Amorim is sacked. The Portuguese head coach has struggled to make much of an impact since taking over from Erik ten Hag last November.",
      "They could only muster a miserable 15th-place finish in the Premier League last season, while this term has seen a mixed-bag of ups and downs. At the time of writing, United sit tenth in the league table with three wins, three losses and a draw to their name.",
      "They were also knocked out of the Carabao Cup in August after a penalty shootout with League Two side, Grimsby Town. While many fans have started to grow tired with Amorim's style of management and lack of results, he may have bought himself a little more time with a 2-0 win over Sunderland AFC ahead of the international break - with Mason Mount and Benjamin Sesko clinching all three points for the Red Devils.",
      "As a result of his tough tenure with the club, a number of potential candidates have been linked with replacing Amorim as of recent, from Brighton's Fabian Hurzeler and Crystal Palace's Oliver Glasner, to La Liga legends like Zinedine Zidane and Xavi Hernandez.",
      "And while Southgate has also been linked with taking up the top job at Old Trafford, the former Middlesbrough was recently suggested to hold a number of demands that the board may not be able to meet. As per the Sun, sources suggest that United executives would have to stick to any long-term plans.",
      "It is also claimed that Southgate harbours concerns that the board would need instant success from him, despite him taking a gradual approach over a prolonged period. Southgate hasn't managed in the English top flight since Middlesbrough were relegated in 2009.",
      "Instead, he has dedicated the last decade or so of his life to international football, taking the reins of England's U21 side in 2013, before gaining promotion to the first-team three years later.",
      "While he failed to win a major title with the Three Lions, Southgate successfully guided England to runner-up places at Euro 2020 and Euro 2024, as well as a third-place finish in the 2018/19 UEFA Nations League.",

      "Manchester United could see an 87-year record broken if midfielder Kobbie Mainoo leaves the club. The academy graduate has struggled for regular game time under Ruben Amorim so far this season.",
      "After being an unused substitute for the opening two Premier League games, Mainoo has been used off the bench in the last five games but is yet to be named in a starting line-up. His only start this season came in the Carabao Cup loss to League Two Grimsby Town back in August.",
      "Mainoo was linked with a move away from Old Trafford in the summer transfer window, with the England international outlining his desire to go out on loan. United, however, wanted to keep the player and resisted any approaches.",
      "The lack of starts has seen Mainoo linked with a transfer in January, with Serie A club Napoli said to be confident of a deal . The Italian side were one of the clubs linked with an interest back in the summer.",
      "ESPN now report that United are set to hold talks with both Mainoo and teammate Joshua Zirkzee over their future, ahead of the transfer window re-opening in the new year. Both players are reported to have concerns over their lack of game time.",
      "The outcome of those talks could have an impact on the transfer decision when the January window comes around. If United do decide to let Mainoo leave, then a record that has stood since 1937 could be on the line.",
      "United have had an academy graduate involved in every matchday squad since October 1937, an 87-year streak. However, against Sunderland before the international break, Mainoo was the only member of the squad to come from the academy.",
      "Without Mainoo in the squad, that record could potentially come to an end. That could be potentially be another thing going against Ruben Amorim, who has found himself under pressure after a mixed start to the new Premier League season.",

      "Finnish entrepreneur Thomas Zilliacus has unveiled a fresh strategy to attract investors in a bid to buy Manchester United. He had previously proposed a plan that could have netted the club a whopping $20billion in 2023.",
      "Zilliacus was among the contenders, including Sheikh Jassim and Sir Jim Ratcliffe, when the Glazer family considered selling part or all of the club two years ago. Despite his fan-led proposal not making the cut, he insists it could have been a profitable venture.",
      "The ex-Nokia official revealed that his team was working on an app that would have allowed fans to gain a small stake in the club and some control in how it's run for a fee of $400. This \"Swedish model\", as he called it, had been trialled and in theory could have generated up to $20b if just five per cent of his estimated one billion United fans worldwide were targeted.",
      "Zilliacus has now stated that he is once again open to investing in the club. His updated position includes a willingness to collaborate with other backers, including the Glazers, amid ongoing rumours that the club is on the market.",
      "\"But at the same time, the club could be developed so that it becomes once again, the best club in the world. And the fans are happy and everybody's happy. That's the way I see it.\"",
      "Zilliacus reckons that irrespective of his fresh proposal and his willingness to collaborate with the existing majority shareholders, the Glazer family will shortly offload their stake. He also suspects they will demand more than the club's actual value.",
      "When quizzed about whether the Glazers will shortly exit Old Trafford, Zilliacus responded: \"I would think so. I mean, they have already made so much money out of the club.",
      "\"They have not gelled well with the fans. I don't think people want to forever be involved with assets where they get a lot of negative feedback as owners, as the Glazers continue to do.",
      "\"So I would think that if the price is right, yes, they want to sell. That's how I would see it. I think that the time for that to happen will be pretty soon.",
      "\"But looking at the experience two years ago, I think they will demand a hell of a lot and they will ask for more than what the club really is worth. But then again, there are two ways to look at the club.",
      "\"One is what is it worth today and the other is what it can become. What can it be worth with the right decisions made? The program that I have to engage the club to perhaps a billion fans around the world, that is where I see the real value.",
      "\"That value is very high, which means that you could actually justify a higher price than what the valuation is today, because of the potential that fan base holds.\"",

      "It's been a turbulent start to the season for Manchester United, who are still searching for consistency under Ruben Amorim. Last weekend's 2-0 victory over Sunderland offered a rare boost, injecting some much-needed optimism ahead of the international break.",
      "However, the victory, while promising, merely masks some fairly large cracks. United have already suffered three Premier League defeats this season, and the humiliating EFL Cup exit to League Two side Grimsby Town back in August still stings.",
      "It's also worth noting that their three league victories came against two newly promoted sides and a Chelsea team that spent almost the entire match with 10 men. Even so, there have been encouraging signs of progress in recent weeks.",
      "Summer signing Benjamin Sesko has found the net in consecutive games, while fellow newcomer Senne Lammens impressed on his debut between the sticks against the Black Cats. Amorim's tactical philosophy is also beginning to take shape, with United occasionally looking sharper and more fluid in possession than under the Portuguese coach last season.",
      "Senne Lammens made a strong case to become United's permanent No. 1 with an assured display against Sunderland. Having spent the early weeks of the campaign behind Altay Bayindir, the Belgian seized his opportunity in style - keeping United's first clean sheet of the season and exuding a composure that's been sorely lacking between the posts in recent years.",
      "Confident with the ball at his feet and decisive when called upon, Lammens' performance may have gone some way to convincing his team-mates that he's the right man for the job - amid reports he wasn't universally backed in the dressing room when he arrived at Old Trafford last month.",
      "According to GiveMeSport, sections of the squad had \"strongly pushed\" the club's hierarchy to sign Aston Villa's Emiliano Martinez instead. The 33-year-old was heavily linked with United throughout the summer, following what appeared to be an emotional farewell to Villains fans on the final day of last season.",
      "Many within Amorim's coaching circle were said to be admirers of Martinez as well, but United ultimately chose to pursue Lammens. Whether the 23-year-old - who joined for £18.5million from Antwerp on Deadline Day - is aware of those early doubts remains unclear. If he is, his performances suggest he's using them as motivation rather than a burden.",
      "Manchester United's ownership saga shows no signs of abating, with Finnish billionaire Thomas Zilliacus confirming fresh interest in acquiring a stake in the club - or potentially the whole thing. The 61-year-old entrepreneur, a lifelong Red Devils supporter, revealed he's drafting a new proposal to rally investors, including a possible reunion with former rival bidder Sheikh Jassim bin Hamad Al Thani.",
      "Zilliacus previously fronted a fan-backed consortium during the 2023 sale process, but his late entry missed the window as Sir Jim Ratcliffe's Ineos secured a 27.7 per cent minority stake and control of football operations for £1.25billion. Undeterred, Zilliacus insists this time around would be a collaborative effort, not a hostile bid.",
      "\"This is about joining forces with the right parties with the sole aim of bringing Manchester United back to where it should be as the number one club in the world.",
      "Zilliacus emphasised that his plan would include a fan-led model rather than a traditional takeover, something he believes the Glazer family currently rejects. \"I think the Glazers, unfortunately, are a good example of somebody who is not really looking out for the club, but rather using it as a cash cow,\" he said.",
      "\"I have a program that involves the fans who are overseas, who cannot come to watch a game. And my program can evolve in a way that can bring significant new revenues to the club.\"",
      "He also expressed openness to working with other investors, including Ratcliffe and Sheikh Jassim. \"I actually have nothing against working with people like Jim Ratcliffe or any investor, whoever that may be. Because I'm not in this to have a trophy that I can show off to other people,\" he said.",
      "\"When I had made my bid I realised that the Glazers were playing a game where Jim Ratcliffe and Sheikh Jassim and myself were just trying to outbid each other... I publicly said that this is madness… So I said, 'Why don't we join forces and take over the club together?'\"",
      "Zilliacus concluded that he remains \"completely open\" to renewed talks with potential partners, reaffirming his ambition to restore Manchester United to \"the best club in the world.\"",

      "The Saudi sports supremo caused astonishment when he made the assertion about a prospective sale to new backers this week, with reports indicating that United sources were taken aback and that the claims lack substance.",
      "He posted on X, previously Twitter: \"The best news I heard today is that Manchester United is now in an advanced stage of completing a deal to sell to a new investor – I hope he's better than the previous owners.\"",

      "According to talkSPORT, the Glazer family price United above £5billion amid rumours of a Middle Eastern takeover. They have reported that the consortium Alalshikh has mentioned is United Arab Emirates-based and the outlet have been told that several United icons have been contacted regarding potential investment.",
      "The Glazers sold a minority stake to Ratcliffe's INEOS group in 2024, and it's been suggested that there's a clause in the deal meaning he'd be forced to sell his shares or match any offer that the American family accept from interested parties.",
      "Alalshikh has already played a key role in transforming the world of boxing by helping sanction blockbuster fights in the ring. There are whispers that he himself has been eyeing up an investment in an English football club.",

      "\"Last week, I was sitting and thinking through all the possibilities of investing in Manchester United and drafting a basic plan on how I could approach certain parties to see if something could be done.",
      "\"This is about joining forces with the right parties with the sole aim of bringing Manchester United back to where it should be as the number one club in the world.",
      "\"I mean, my love for the club has gone nowhere and I think the opportunity is still there. So I would really welcome an opportunity to talk to the key players and see what can be done.",
      "\"The key players, of course, today, Ratcliffe, then if other parties would be keen to join as well, then that would be great. Some of the investors, I think it's almost everything or nothing, meaning either they own the club alone or they are not interested. So you would have to find the investors who are willing to look at what is best for the club and not what is best for the investor.\"",
      "The Times' Charlotte Duncker reckons that Man United would be up for grabs at the right price but there's no certainty that Ratcliffe would seal a complete buyout.",
      "\"Obviously, Jim Ratcliffe has that 30 per cent stake, that doesn't mean that the Glazers aren't going to consider selling.",
      "\"I think for the right price they definitely would and there's a clause within Ratcliffe's agreement when he bought the club, I think it was triggered in August this year, that meant if the right offer came in, I think it was over something like $33-a-share the Glazer's could sell the whole club, not just their proportion of it, Ratcliffe would be bought out of it as well.",
      "\"There is potential that the Glazers could see the entire club, but at the minute this seems a strange one with this news and hype by this one tweet.\"",
      "Rumours surrounding a potential bid for Manchester United have boosted the club's market capitalisation value by £115million, according to football finance expert Kieran Maguire.",

      "Michael Owen has leapt to the defence of Ruben Amorim, describing criticism of his tactics as 'embarrassing'. The likes of Gary Neville and Wayne Rooney have often questioned why the Manchester United boss hasn't ditched his system following some disappointing results.",
      "The Red Devils have only won half of their Premier League games this season, and they crashed out of the Carabao Cup to Grimsby Town in the second round on penalties. Amorim is yet to win back-to-back games since taking charge in November 2024.",
      "The Portuguese tactician has been heavily scrutinised since he replaced Erik ten Hag in the dugout, but Owen believes he's been unfairly scapegoated. In an interview with the Daily Mail, the former Premier League striker insisted that the problems are Old Trafford run much deeper than the formation, as he hit back at United icons who have called out Amorim recently.",
      "\"They have changed the manager numerous times since [Sir Alex] Fergie left,\" said Owen. \"Then they blamed the players; spent billions on players and got some of the best players in the world, only for the club to be seen as a bit of a graveyard for players in the last decade.",
      "\"Next, it was the people buying the players, so everyone wanted rid of them. Then it was the board, so the board was shuffled around when Sir Jim Ratcliffe got involved.",
      "\"Then it's the fault of the facilities, so they wanted to revamp the training ground and put plans in for a new stadium. Then it's the staff, so half the backroom staff, physios, doctors, canteen lady, the whole thing, wiped clean and a new start there.",
      "\"The latest one is it’s because they're playing a back-three. If I'm not wrong, I watched Erik Ten Hag about a year ago playing a back-four, and it was some of the most awful football I've ever seen from a Manchester United team.\"",
      "Owen added: \"Some great teams over the years have played with a back-three. I'm not saying that's my favourite formation at all, and I'm not saying that Amorim is right to be steadfast in his beliefs in that formation.",
      "\"But I certainly don't think all of United's problems now are because they play with the back-three. It's embarrassing if you're going to say the main reason for the downturn is because they play a back-three.",
      "\"I mean, it really isn't. They could go back to a back-four and play as bad as they did under Ten Hag, then the screams would be equally as loud.\"",
      "In a separate interview, Owen sympathised with Amorim, claiming that negative comments from pundits, like Neville and Rooney, could be distracting the United squad. Speaking to casino.co.uk, the 45-year-old said: \"Players aren't sheltered away from everything.",
      "\"They're driving cars to training, putting the radio on. They sit at home in the lounge with the TV on. They read social media. They can do all these things. If you're interested in football, you can't get away from what people are thinking and saying about it.",
      "\"Whether footballers should be swayed by those comments or impacted by them, that's a different argument. But I've got no doubt that people will watch and will listen to people they probably respected and thought were great players growing up.",
      "\"They’ll listen to those opinions. If they're saying certain things, then it might enter their head, and they could perhaps wonder if the manager is doing the right thing.",
      "\"They might have their own ideas, but that's not a new phenomenon. That will never change. It never has changed, but I do think it is a relevant point to make by Amorim.\"",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Ruben Amorim pleaded with his players to deliver 'no more heart attacks' in a dressing-room message after last week's crucial win over Sunderland.",
      "The Manchester United boss has called upon his players to continue to deliver mature performances in order to put together a run of positive results as they bid to turn their season around. The Red Devils came away 2-0 victors at Old Trafford to earn three points before the international break. Mason Mount and Benjamin Sesko scored in the first half against the Black Cats to bounce back from defeat to Brentford.",
      "Amorim was very happy with United's display and, according to The Sun, was relieved to avoid any drama before his stars departed to play for their national teams. In communicating this to his players in the dressing room, Amorim is said to have described earlier performances as 'too mentally draining' and believes that is causing the club greater problems.",
      "United currently sit 10th in the Premier League with 10 points after the opening seven matches. Amorim's side are three points behind Manchester City who are currently fifth.",
      "The club are looking to recover from a dismal 2024/25, which saw them finish 15th in the division. Amorim's position had come under scrutiny with an uncertain start to this season.",
      "Asked whether he was happy to have earned a straightforward win, Amorim indicated as much in his press conference after Sunderland. “Yeah, and a clean sheet is really important,\" he said. \"We didn't play well during all the game, but we had our moments. But if you look at the performance, it was a team.",
      "\"Focus, defending well, trying to kill the game in the second half. So, I'm pleased with that, and now it's [time] to move forward to the next one.\"",
      "United co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe has provided Amorim with his backing. The Ineos chief believes his coach can only be judged over a longer period.",
      "“He has not had the best of seasons,” said Ratcliffe. “Amorim is a good guy. I would say Ruben needs to demonstrate that he's a great coach over three years.",
      "“That’s where I would be - three years - because football is not overnight. Look at Mikel Arteta at Arsenal, he had a miserable time the first couple of years.”",
      "Asked whether he could be told to sack Amorim by the club's majority owners, the Glazers, Ratcliffe's response was emphatic. \"It’s not going to happen,\" he said.",

      "Claims of a potential takeover at Manchester United have reportedly been met with surprise by insiders close to Sir Jim Ratcliffe. Earlier this week, Turki Al-Sheikh set tongues wagging when he suggested that the Reds were in 'advanced negotiations with a new investor'.",
      "claims United officials were taken aback by the Saudi Arabian billionaire's activity on X, stating his reports were 'news to them'. They reported that Ratcliffe and his INEOS team didn't believe Al-Sheikh's claims.",
      "On Wednesday night, the Saudi government official stirred the pot by claiming that United were on the brink of sealing a deal. Given Ratcliffe's somewhat recent acquisition of a minority stake, many speculated that Al-Sheikh's cryptic post was aimed at the Glazers.",
      "On social media, he wrote: \"The best news I heard today is that Manchester United is now in an advanced stage of completing a deal to sell to a new investor... I hope he's better than the previous owners.\"",
      "The Saudi tycoon, who owned Spanish club Almeria from 2019 until earlier this year after they failed to secure promotion to La Liga, shared the post with his seven million followers. It quickly went viral, racking up a staggering number of views, likes and shares.",
      "Al-Sheikh provided an update on the alleged negotiations on Thursday evening. He said: \"My yesterday's post about Manchester United's potential sale meant one thing: the club is in an advanced negotiation phase with a new investor.",
      "\"Just to clarify, I am not the investor, nor are they from my nation. I'm posting this as a fan who wishes the deal to happen, though it might not necessarily happen.\"",
      "The Times also explained why Ratcliffe could be left out of the loop if the Glazers decided to suddenly sell. Noting that just because the British billionaire has a 30 per cent stake, that doesn't mean the Glazers won't consider cashing in without consultation.",
      "The report added that the family would 'definitely sell United for the right price'. It also unearthed a clause inserted into Ratcliffe's deal, which was triggered in August this year, allowing the Glazers to sell their stake if they received the 'right offer'.",
      "They report claims that a bid of $33 a share could be enough to tempt the family to sell the whole club. While Al-Sheikh's post reignited speculation of a takeover, Ratcliffe has shown no indication of walking away from Old Trafford.",
      "In a recent appearance on The Business podcast, produced by The Times and The Sunday Times, the British billionaire insisted he retains control of football operations at the club.",
      "When questioned about what would occur if the Glazers instructed him to dismiss Ruben Amorim, Ratcliffe responded: \"It's not going to happen.\"",
      "The INEOS chief, who has held just under 30 percent of United since February 2024, continued: \"That probably sums it up. We're local, and they're on the other side of the pond.",
      "\"That's a long way away to try and manage a football club as big and complex as Manchester United. We're here with feet on the ground. They [the Glazers] get a bad rep... but they are really nice people and they are really passionate about the club.\"",
      "Highlighting his long-term vision, the 72-year-old stated: \"Ruben needs to demonstrate he is a great coach over three years.\"",
      "When asked if the United manager is granted three years to turn things around, Ratcliffe confirmed: \"Yes. That is where I would be. Three years. Because football is not overnight. It's three years.",
      "\"You also look at [Mikel] Arteta at Arsenal. He had a miserable time over the first couple of years. We have to be patient. We have a long-term plan. It isn't a light switch.",
      "\"You can't run a club like Manchester United on knee-jerk reactions to some journalist who goes off on one every week...\"",

      "Mainoo had no desire to quit his boyhood club on a permanent basis and simply wanted a temporary spell elsewhere to guarantee game time this season. Italian giants Napoli showed interest, but it's understood the youngster has been grafting away at Carrington to win over United boss Ruben Amorim, who has thrown down the gauntlet for him to up his standards.",

      "\"The PGB concluded that Arsenal FC had failed to comply with the 2024-25 FA Cup Rule 192 and imposed a suspended £500,000 fine. The fine is suspended pending Arsenal FC's confirmation that it is able to comply with this requirement for the 2025-26 FA Cup third round and continued compliance for any further rounds of this season's competition.\"",
      "It marks the end of a lengthy ordeal involving the clubs. United, crucially, claimed victory on the pitch, with the scores having been 1-1 after extra-time.",

Heaven went down and required lengthy treatment before returning to action, but he was substituted at half-time, prompting concerns that he could face another spell on the sidelines.",

      "David joined the MEN as Chief Manchester United Writer in September 2025.",
      "Manchester United spent £236million on new signings in the first summer transfer window of Ruben Amorim's reign.",
      "Big-money signings Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko were joined by less high-profile arrivals in left-back Diego Leon and goalkeeper Senme Lammens.",
      "Now the new arrivals have had time to settle in, how have they fared since joining United? Here, we grade Amorim's summer recruits.",
      "Matheus Cunha: There was huge expectation after United agreed a £65m deal with Wolves for the mercurial and tempestuous Brazil forward, but Cunha has made a slower than expected start to his United career.",
      "Injured in the last-gasp 3-2 win over Burnley, when he was forced off in the first-half, he missed the 3-0 Manchester derby defeat, but returned at Brentford, with his cross to Mbeumo winning a penalty which was ultimately missed by skipper Bruno Fernandes.",
      "Mason Mount's goalscoring return in the 2-0 win over Sunderland and relentless industry has probably nudged him ahead of Cunha in terms of selection. It will be interesting to see how Cunha responds to that. 6",
      "Bryan Mbeumo: The former Brentford forward, signed for £71m, has unquestionably been United's stand-out summer signing. Mbeumo has hit the ground running following his summer switch, which is all the more remarkable given he was behind his new team-mates in terms of pre-season fitness and only featured in the final game on United's US summer tour.",
      "Two goals and an assist do not do justice to his overall contribution, his pace, physicality and diagonal runs in behind opposition defences giving United's attack a new dimension. He has started every Premier League game his season, underlining his importance. 8",
      "Benjamin Sesko: Sesko has undeniably taken time to settle, but two goals in his last two games shows he is getting there and he has looked more comfortable with every game.",
      "After admitting Sesko looked “on his own” in United's 3-0 derby defeat at Manchester City, Amorim has sought to tweak his approach by playing to the 6ft 4in striker's strengths, with long balls for him to flick-on for his fellow attackers to win the second balls and force opponents onto the back foot.",
      "Sesko's poacher's instincts from close-range have yielded his goals and his physical strength, allied to his aerial threat, makes him a handful for defenders. 7",
      "Senne Lammens: An £18.2million deadline day signing from Royal Antwerp, he was a relative unknown before arriving at United, who also looked at moving for Aston Villa's experienced World Cup-wining keeper Emi Martinez, but that deal broke down.",
      "That saw United move for Lammens, who had to bide his time before making an assured debut in the 2-0 win over Sunderland, which had the Old Trafford crowd chanting “Are you Schmeichel in disguise?”.",
      "Such was the assurance Lammens transmitted to his defence, unlike Altay Bayindir and Andre Onana before him, it is hard to see him being dislodged. He commanded his box, used both feet, showcased decent distribution and already looks a major upgrade between the posts. 7",
      "Diego Leon: Defender Leon became United's second signing of the summer, after Cunha, when the 18-year-old joined from Paraguayan club Cerro Porteno for an initial fee of £3.3m, rising to £7m with add-ons.",
      "Given Leon has yet to make his United debut, it is hard to grade him. He was named on the bench for the games against Grimsby, Manchester City, Brentford and Sunderland, but remained there.",
      "Worryingly, he was subbed at half-time after failing to impress for United's Under-21s in a 2-1 win at Liverpool last month, suggesting he has a way to go before he can be considered for a first-team debut.",

      "Shea Lacey will have had worse weeks.",
      "The Manchester United prospect impressed for England Under-20s on debut in defeat on Friday afternoon, days after being called into senior training by Three Lions boss Thomas Tuchel.",
      "The teenager was one of the players drafted in from age-group sides to assist in training with the senior squad ahead of Thursday night's friendly win over Wales.",
      "And while the shift across St George's Park is billed as fleshing out the squad for the session, it is far from merely making up the numbers.",
      "Tuchel and his staff will undoubtedly have had a say in who was promoted from the Under-20 squad and the England staff as a whole will no doubt have been involved in the discussion.",
      "Lacey will have taken plenty from the experience and impressed for the Under-20s in their 1-0 friendly defeat to Switzerland on Friday afternoon, twice coming close to scoring the the Young Lions.",
      "The international impression is the latest staging post in the United prospect's career and comes after a fine showing at club level this term which has seen him score twice in three Premier League 2 contests.",
      "He has long been talked about as a bright prospect at United - and this season might prove a pivotal period in the 18-year-old's development.",
      "Lacey was one of a clutch of youngsters who were alongside the senior group when United returned to pre-season training in the summer.",
      "The playmaker had an injury-hit campaign last term and was carefully managed as a result. His minutes at academy level were therefore limited, but he did travel on the post-season tour to Asia and was handed a senior appearance off the bench in the defeat to ASEAN All-Stars.",
      "That offered a glimpse of what he can offer with his ability on the ball evident. Lacey signed a professional deal at the first opportunity last year and Old Trafford insiders believe he has the potential to break into the first team.",
      "He featured for United's Under-18s aged just 14 and is capable of playing in a variety of positions while the Reds academy coaches like to challenge youngsters in different roles.",
      "His long-term future could be as an attacking midfielder, while comparisons have been made with Manchester City and England star Phil Foden, ironically not called up by England this month as Lacey joined in training.",
      "The United prospect has a long way to go before being mentioned in similar dispatches to the Etihad ace but Lacey has evidently impressed for club and country.",
      "It would be no surprise to see him play a larger role for both in the coming years.",

      "Despite not being given regular gametime, he has always maintained his fitness levels and will be hoping to get back in the United squad.",

      "The England star is currently on a season-long loan to Barcelona from Manchester United, with the Spanish titans having the option to make the move permanent for £26million next summer. Rashford's performances and form at Barcelona have attracted attention from other European clubs, with Paris Saint-Germain even being linked after their Champions League encounter.",
      "However, Rashford remains focused on performing well enough to secure a permanent transfer to Barcelona next summer, fulfilling his dream of playing for the Catalan club since his departure from Old Trafford. Barcelona manager Hansi Flick has publicly commended Rashford, and the 27-year-old has also caught the eye of England manager Thomas Tuchel during international duty.",
      "The United loanee made an appearance as a second-half substitute in Thursday's resounding 3-0 victory over Wales. Rashford will be hoping to start in Tuesday's match against Latvia, where England could secure qualification for the World Cup if results are in their favour.",
      "He's been on fire since the last international break, netting a goal in the 5-0 triumph over Serbia. In his most recent eight matches for both club and country, Rashford has delivered four goals and four assists.",
      "His latest goal was scored in Barca's surprising 4-1 defeat to Sevilla, as the La Liga champions relinquished their hold on first place. Flick praised Rashford's display following his double strike in the Champions League that secured Barcelona's 2-1 triumph over Newcastle at St James' Park last month.",
      "\"I am not surprised [by his goals],\" Flick commented afterwards. \"I think he's a fantastic player. His skills are unbelievable and his finishing is unbelievable. I think also in the first half, he tried to create chances, but the finishing wasn't there. In the second half it was.",
      "\"For a striker, it's always good to score. I am really happy. He is an important player. When we spoke before the season about what we needed in the team, we felt we needed a player like him. When we had this chance [to sign him], I said we have to do it. He's an outstanding player.\"",
      "Rashford continued: \"I'm learning a lot, it's a new style of football,\" and \"But it's making me a better player. Honestly, it's an amazing experience. I've always been a huge admirer of Barcelona, every player my age has watched them play, it's amazing football.\"",
      "Meanwhile, Deco, Barca's sporting director, recently told Mundo Deportivo: \"There's no penalty clause in the loan agreement if we don't sign him. We do have an option to make it permanent if we want to. It's too early to talk about decisions for next season; what matters is that we're happy with him.\"",

      "Liverpool's Ibrahima Konate has been forced to withdraw from international duty due to injury concerns.",
      "The defender was benched for France against Azerbaijan and will not be joining the team for their trip to Iceland. Konate arrived at Clairefontaine with an existing injury and has been unable to recover in time to participate in Les Bleus' World Cup qualifying matches.",
      "The Frenchman had to leave the pitch during Liverpool's last Premier League match against Chelsea with a thigh injury. Didier Deschamps' squad is set to jet off to Reykjavik on Saturday evening, preparing for their match against Iceland on Monday.",
      "However, Konate will not be accompanying them as he focuses on his recovery. The former RB Leipzig player has been following a personalised treatment plan for a his injury.",
      "A statement from the French national team read: \"Injured in the right quadriceps during his last match with Liverpool, Ibrahima Konaté has followed a treatment and protocol since his arrival this Monday but will not be able to take his place against Iceland. Benjamin Pavard is called in as reinforcement and will join the group in Reykjavik.\"",
      "Now, the question remains whether he will be fit enough to play in Liverpool's upcoming match against Manchester United next weekend. Konate made an early exit during the second half of Liverpool's defeat to Chelsea, leaving manager Arne Slot with limited options in central defence.",
      "Curtis Jones stepped in to replace the 26-year-old, with Ryan Gravenberch moving to join Virgil van Dijk in the backline. Despite the concern over Konate's injury, Slot remains hopeful that the defender was substituted quickly enough to prevent any serious complications, reports the Mirror.",
      "He said at full-time: \"I don't know if it is a big injury, but what I do know is he limped a little bit and when I asked him he said he felt his quad a little bit. Then, for me, all alarm bells go off because in another sprint you never know if that is going to go good.",
      "\"It was also already a substitution I had in mind, maybe for a few minutes or a little bit later, because the right centre-back had a lot of ball possession and we needed to create from that position.We all know Ryan [Gravenberch] is quite good in that.",
      "\"It might be OK that he went off early enough but it was clear I had to take him off because he was limping.\"",
      "Konate was deemed fit enough to join his national side, but it appears he is still struggling with the same problem. Joe Gomez could yet deputise, but he was not chosen from the bench against Chelsea after returning from injury himself.",
      "Liverpool have already seen Giovanni Leoni ruled out for the rest of the season after tearing his ACL on his full debut. The Italian youngster put in an impressive Carabao Cup display but saw his outing overshadowed by the traumatic injury.",
      "It should be positive news for Manchester United fans, as the Reds travel to Anfield to face the Premier League champions on Sunday, October 19. Ruben Amorim has endured a mixed-bag of results this season thus far, as United sit 10th in the Premier League standings with three wins, as many losses and a draw to show for their efforts.",
      "However, after achieving a 2-0 win over Sunderland AFC at Old Trafford ahead of the international break, and largely sound in terms of injuries, the Portuguese tactician will hope to kickstart his drive for European qualification against Liverpool.",

      "David joined the MEN as Chief Manchester United Writer in September 2025.",
      "Given the way Rasmus Hojlund has flourished since leaving Manchester United this summer, Denmark boss Brian Riemer would appear to have a point.",
      "Hojlund, who has joined Napoli on a season-long loan, scored twice for his country as they thumped Belarus 6-0 in a World Cup qualifier on Thursday.",
      "The double took Hojlund's tally for club and country to seven goals already this season, including late winners in the Champions League against Sporting Lisbon and Genoa in Serie A.",
      "Considering Hojlund only managed 10 goals in all competitions for United last season – just four in the Premier League - to say the 22-year-old is reborn as a player is something of an understatement.",
      "Hojlund has revived his stagnant career within a matter of weeks at Napoli, just like fellow United outcasts Marcus Rashford and Antony have done at Barcelona and Real Betis respectively, and is thriving on the supply line provided by fellow summer arrival, former Manchester City midfielder Kevin De Bruyne.",
      "Hojlund's explosive start to life in Italy makes it legitimate to question whether United jettisoned him too soon and would have been better served holding on to him, despite the £74million acquisition of Benjamin Sesko.",
      "Denmark boss Riemer certainly thinks so. “I think Rasmus has the quality for both leagues, without discussion,” he said. “Does he fit in Italian football? Yes. There was no doubt about that, because he had already proven that. But that doesn't mean he doesn't fit in English football. On the contrary, I would almost say.",
      "“The fact that he's now in a well-functioning team and has players around him who take pride in doing good for others helps to make the outcome for a striker like Rasmus, who needs to be serviced. It's more important than which league you play in.”",
      "Reimer has a point. Watching Hojlund's two goals against Sporting, both provided by De Bruyne, it is hard to recall the young striker being afforded the same service at United, certainly in his second season, when he was starved of it.",
      "Hojlund was not helped by never being able to step out of the firing line during his two seasons at Old Trafford, where he lead the attack week-in, week-out, without any respite, because there was no-one else to share the burden.",
      "He said as much on United's pre-season tour of the US, before he was offloaded to make way for the arrival of Benjamin Sesko. Had United qualified for Europe this season, perhaps Hojlund could have stayed to share attacking duties with Sesko, but too few fixtures meant something had to give and it was the Dane who was moved on, rather than Joshua Zirkzee.",
      "Whether that will prove a mistake or not, with Napoli able to buy Hojlund for £38m at the end of their loan agreement – roughly half of what United paid for him – only time will tell. But the early signs are not looking good for United, give the electric start Hojlund has made to life it Italy.",

      "United boss Ruben Amorim said Bayindir and Lammens will fight for the right to be first-choice keeper, following Andre Onana's season-long move to Turkish side Trabzonspor.",
      "Deadline day signing Lammens has moved above Bayindir to claim the No.1 spot after an impressive debut in United's 2-0 win over Sunderland before the international break.",
      "That assured display between the posts means Lammens will keep his place for United's trip to reigning Premier League champions and arch rivals Liverpool a week on Sunday.",
      "Despite their rivalry for the keeper's jersey Bayindir was among the United players to congratulate Lammens on his debut and revealed the pair are close, despite their personal competition.",
      "“That is the way, everyone has to be together, always,” said Bayindir. “We have a good group, a good goalkeeper group, and we are always pushing each of ourselves on the pitch.",
      "“Of course, we are fighting for the shirt, but in the outside, we have a good relationship, like how we did with Andre. He's at Trabzonspor and he's doing well.”",
      "United have struggled at the start of Amorim's first full season in charge, losing three of their opening seven league games to stand 10th in the table, with Bayindir calling on every player to give more to improve their plight.",
      "“I can say football is a team thing,” said Bayindir. “Everyone needs to work good, you know? Everyone needs to be focused. From my side, every day, after every game, we are improving ourselves and we're thinking what we need to do more.",
      "“After the game, we are doing the analysis. We're seeing everything in the analysis, which parts we have to improve – everything. When you can catch the routine, you can be better every game, because it's about experience. Also you're learning something from every game and that's the important thing.”",
      "United's failure to qualify for Europe and humiliating EFL Cup exit to League Two Grimsby means Amorim's side are currently restricted to one game a week, something Bayindir said must change next season.",
      "“After the game, you have more time to recover and you have more time to be ready for the next game,” said Bayindir.",
      "“But we want to play more games in the week. We can play three games. We want to play more games. It's why this year is more and more important than other years before, because we have to be good.",
      "“Then next year, we want to play more games as, if you're playing for this great club, you have to do more and give everything yourself. I hope we can win more games and everything can be more positive for us. I hope we can make everyone happy.",
      "“Sometimes I'm quiet but I was captain of Fenerbahce and I have this streak, I have this soul. I'm not quiet and calm. I'm always thinking what we have to do. It's never 'I don't care', never if we lose 'it's not my fault' – you can't be successful if you have this idea.”",

      "JJ Gabriel enjoys video games and comes out of his shell once he gets to know someone.",
      "In many ways he is a normal 14-year-old, but his extraordinary talent is revealed when he steps onto a football pitch. There is certainly nothing normal about what Gabriel can do with a ball at his feet.",
      "That is quite the prediction considering the graduates who have come before Gabriel, who already has more than 200,000 followers on Instagram and a sponsorship deal with Nike.",
      "Academy coaches who have worked with Gabriel have marvelled at the youngster's skillset and have struggled to find weaknesses, despite playing him years above his age group.",
      "Gabriel idolises Neymar and some of his goals are reminiscent of the Brazilian at the peak of his powers. Last weekend in an Under-18 game, Gabriel glided into the penalty area, deceived a Manchester City defender with a shimmy and found the corner. The clip has amassed thousands of views on social media.",
      "Word of Gabriel's talent has already swept around the world. Europe's top clubs have closely followed his development, and the teenager was close to leaving United in the summer.",
      "Talks were advanced with a European giant and an eleventh-hour meeting was held at Carrington in an attempt to keep Gabriel. It's understood Jason Wilcox (director of football) and Omar Berrada (CEO) were present, which shows the high regard in which Gabriel is held.",
      "United reiterated that Gabriel could become the face of the club and it was eventually agreed the teenage sensation would remain in Manchester - the player's final decision was decisive.",
      "There are windows for rivals to poach academy players at 14 and 16. Gabriel has committed his future at United for another two years at least, but interest from Europe's biggest sides will only intensify as he gets older, especially as he holds a European passport through his parents.",
      "United know they have a special talent on their hands and recently introduced Gabriel to Ruben Amorim. During their exchange, Amorim spent time discussing his philosophy and stressed the importance of working hard, even recalling an anecdote about Cristiano Ronaldo as an example.",
      "Amorim played alongside Ronaldo for Portugal's national team. The United boss recounted stories about Ronaldo's work ethic - he was the first to report for training and the last to leave.",
      "Gabriel does not lack a work ethic. He is already living like a dedicated professional athlete with his diet and recovery sessions, and wakes up at 6am most days to make his dream a reality.",
      "In the summer, he trained at a Nike camp in Marbella with Newcastle midfielder Sandro Tonali and former Liverpool striker Danny Ings. When Marcus Rashford joined Aston Villa on loan in January, Gabriel thanked him for taking penalties with him at Carrington before he left.",
      "He also received a \"get well soon\" video from Andre Onana when he was recovering from his shoulder injury last year. Experienced players are shocked when they learn his age.",
      "Gabriel has been offered a box at the new Old Trafford, which is planned to be completed by 2030, and was invited to watch the Premier League opener against Arsenal in the directors' box.",
      "It speaks volumes that brands are already desperate to work with Gabriel, who was subject to interest from Adidas before Nike beat off competition from the German company.",
      "Adidas were in pole position to sign Gabriel before a late effort from Nike to better their offer - how many 14-year-olds could spark a bidding war between sportswear's commercial giants?",
      "United want to temper expectations to help Gabriel focus on football. Former academy director Nick Cox was asked a question about Gabriel during an interview earlier this year and politely steered the conversation in another direction. Those questions will become common for his successor.",
      "Those who know Gabriel are not concerned about keeping him grounded. He has strong family support and a circle of friends, and those closest to him don't let him get ahead of himself. He is just JJ to them.",
      "Gabriel possesses the right mentality to enjoy a successful career. It takes him just minutes to forget about the football after leaving the pitch following an academy game at Carrington.",
      "That is a trait that many top professionals share - the ability to separate what happens on the pitch from their home lives - but Gabriel loves playing football and entertaining with the ball.",
      "Darren Fletcher was appointed as U18 manager in the summer, and a source praised Fletcher's handling of Gabriel this season because he wants him on the ball as much as possible.",
      "Gabriel has been played down the middle and from the left this term, although it doesn't matter which position he plays because the end result is the same: he tears through the opposition and scores.",
      "MUTV subscriptions might begin to sell like hot cakes, just so fans can watch Gabriel play.",
      "The teenager's ball control is exceptional, and his finishing power is remarkable for a player of his age. Gabriel has seven goals in six Under-18 appearances and scored for the Under-17s on Wednesday.",
      "He was even given the nickname 'Kid Messi' after clips of him training and completing skills went viral on social media when he was younger, and Lionel Messi would probably approve of his footwork.",
      "Fans have already started to speculate when Gabriel could make his senior debut, and it already feels likely that he will become United's youngest-ever Premier League player.",
      "Angel Gomes (16 years, 263 days), Shola Shoretire (17 years, 19 days) and Chido Obi (17 years, 79 days) are the youngest to make a debut for United in the Premier League.",
      "Gabriel has the potential to break that record, and he could even topple the Premier League record of Ethan Nwaneri (15 years, 181 days). Max Dowman (15 years, 235 days) is the second youngest.",
      "Mikel Arteta has shown faith in Nwaneri and Dowman at Arsenal, while talented Liverpool youngster Rio Ngumoha recently scored on his senior debut aged 16 years and 361 days.",
      "Dowman and Ngumoha have blown away spectators this season, offering an exciting glimpse into the future of English football, but many believe Gabriel could be the pick of the bunch.",
      "There is a reason why Wilcox and Berrada were involved in the meeting to keep Gabriel in the summer, and why the youngster has been offered a box at the new Old Trafford.",
      "He is a generational prospect - and the best is yet to come from the supremely talented teenager.",

      "First-half goals from Mason Mount and Benjamin Sesko were enough to earn United three points that move them up six places to eighth in the Premier League going into the international break.",
      "Here is how United's players rated this afternoon:",
      "Senne Lammens",
      "An assured United debut from the deadline day signing. Confident coming for the ball and made a fine save from Granit Xhaka and one near the end. Will be hard to dislodge him. 8",
      "Leny Yoro",
      "Disciplined in his defending and deserving of his recall to the starting line-up after being benched for the previous two games . Brings better balance to United's back three. 7",
      "Matthijs de Ligt",
      "Alert to danger throughout and never caught out of position defending his goal. Played a key role in United's second goal, challenging for the flick-on that ultimately led to it. 7",
      "Luke Shaw",
      "Kept his place on the left side of United's back three, but moved inside to a more central position at times after the break, giving United greater control on the ball. 7",
      "Amad",
      "A constant threat down the right side. Tormented Sunderland's defence and unlucky not to score in the first-half when he cut inside and saw a goal-bound effort saved. 7",
      "Casemiro",
      "Back in the starting line-up following his one-match ban, he was disciplined in midfield, although he picked up an obligatory booking late on for a poor challenge. 7",
      "Bruno Fernandes",
      "Another ebullient performance from the United skipper, who was seemingly everywhere, covering so much ground. Had an exquisite chip tipped onto the bar by Robin Roefs. 7",
      "Diogo Dalot",
      "Kept his place following the Brentford debacle and it was from his long throw-in that Sesko was able to plunder United's second goal. Impressive energy levels. 7",
      "Bryan Mbeumo",
      "Provided the assist for Mount's opener and never gave the Sunderland defence any peace with his runs in behind and ability to pick up dangerous positions. 7",
      "Benjamin Sesko",
      "Scored for the second game running with a classic poacher's goal from close-range in the first-half. United exploited his aerial threat throughout to win second balls. 7",
      "Mason Mount",
      "Restored to the starting line-up and justified his selection by setting United on their way to victory with a superbly-taken goal. Standing ovation when taken off. 8",
      "Subs:",
      "Dorgu (Dalot, 64)",
      "Solid at left wing-back. 6",
      "Cunha (Mount, 64)",

    "body": [
      "PGMO chief Howard Webb has reportedly admitted to Manchester United that Brentford defender Nathan Collins should have been sent off in their defeat on September 27.",
      "With United trailing 2-1 after an Igor Thiago brace which was pegged back by Benjamin Sesko, the Reds won a penalty after Collins tugged back Bryan Mbeumo inside the penalty area. The spot kick was rightly awarded but the punishment for Collins by referee Craig Pawson was merely a booking.",
      "Had Collins made a genuine attempt to play the ball, a booking would have sufficed in this scenario thanks to the recently introduced 'double jeopardy' rule. However, it seemed clear at the time that Collins did not make a genuine attempt and he was the last man, thus preventing Mbeumo having a goalscoring opportunity.",
      "The decision not to send off Collins would feel even more bitter when Bruno Fernandes missed his penalty and Mathias Jensen scored late to win the game 3-1. According to the Daily Mail, United chiefs Omar Berrada and Jason Wilcox sought clarification on the decision with Webb who admitted the mistake.",
      "It is claimed that United did not want to make a 'public fuss' about the situation and appreciated Webb's rational explanation for why the mistake was made. Of course, had Collins been sent off the context of the game could have been a lot different with United having roughly 20 minutes against ten men to seek an equaliser.",
      "What's more, the defeat caused significant pressure to mount on Ruben Amorim which may not have been the case had the match finished differently. MEN Sport understands that United are not currently considering sacking their Portuguese head coach.",
      "Despite reports stating that Gareth Southgate is among the names that Ineos are considering replacing Amorim with, there are believed to have been no contacts made with other managers regarding the currently filled position at Old Trafford. Fortunately for United, they put the defeat to Brentford behind them on Saturday with a 2-0 victory over Sunderland.",

      "Goalkeeper Senne Lammens began his Manchester United career with a win and a clean sheet, and the Belgian international received plenty of credit from his home country's media. Lammens joined United from Royal Antwerp on transfer deadline day but has needed to wait patiently for his debut while Ruben Amorim continued to keep faith with Altay Bayindir.",
      "The new keeper's opportunity arrived at last on Saturday, with Amorim handing him a start against Sunderland. All went according to plan for the 23-year-old, with goals from Mason Mount and Benjamin Sesko ensuring United got three points and eased the pressure on their head coach.",
      "United's win was a timely one for Amorim, with some suggestions his job could be at risk if his team lost. After the victory, he spoke highly of Lammens while also praising the team as a whole.",
      "\"We didn’t play well all the game, but we had our moments and we defended well,\" Amorim said. \"I think Senne did a great job and gave us confidence. It was a good day, not a perfect day, but to win like this with a clean sheet is important for our team.",
      "\"We need to understand that we need everyone to be ready to play. It's a long season, we have a lot of problems, anything can happen. The important thing is that the teammates helped Lammens a lot to have a very good performance.\"",
      "While Lammens will surely face trickier tests than Sunderland this season, perhaps starting with his next game, he still earned plaudits from the Belgian press.",
      "\"Against Sunderland, the scenario was perfect for Lammens,\" Sporza's verdict began. \"He was barely challenged in the first half and took no risks in possession. It was striking how he constantly connected with his backline and made adjustments.",
      "\"Sober, precise, and controlling. Old Trafford appreciated this and gave Lammens plenty of opportunities at times.\"",
      "The same publication pointed to his sharp save from a long-range Granit Xhaka effort, as well as the let-off he received when Bertrand Traore was booked for diving after it looked for a moment as though Lammens had conceded a penalty.",
      "\"If Ruben Amorim still had any doubts about who would be the first choice goalkeeper, Lammens has more than left his mark today,\" Sporza added.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "Elsewhere in Belgium, HLN highlighted Amorim's praise for Lammens while pointing out the goalkeeper watched much of the first half 'from a distance'. They wrote: \"Just over a month after his arrival and after three matches on the bench, Lammens finally made his debut for Manchester United.",
      "\"The goalkeeper thus became the seventh Belgian to feature for the Red Devils. Marouane Fellaini, Romelu Lukaku, Adnan Januzaj, Ritchie De Laet, Marnick Vermijl, and Largie Ramazani preceded him.",
      "\"Lammens had to prove himself once in the first half. The former Antwerp goalkeeper made a good save on a powerful shot from Xhaka. His play on the ball at his feet and on high balls was also flawless. From a distance, our compatriot saw Manchester United dominate.\"",
      "The report added that his next assignment could be considerably trickier. \"All in all, Lammens can look back with satisfaction on his debut in the Manchester United shirt,\" it read. \"His first clean sheet is a fact. This debut will leave him wanting more. His next assignment? The top-flight match at Anfield against Liverpool on Sunday, October 19th. Lammens will likely be tested more then.\"",
      "Nieuwsblad's Brian Dewulf referenced United fans' response to the impressive debut. \"Just before half-time, Senne Lammens finally got the chance to show his true colours,\" he wrote. \"Granit Xhaka had the first attempt for Sunderland, but Lammens saw the long-range shot come from far out and made a good save. There was applause in Old Trafford.",
      "\"The Belgian goalkeeper remained virtually unemployed in the second half, though it was a bit of a shock after an hour of play. Bruno Fernandes gave his keeper the runaround with a long ball, causing the pair to collide. Sunderland winger Traoré lurked and nearly capitalised, but also went down in the action.",
      "\"Ultimately, Man United were given the foul, allowing Lammens and his teammates to breathe a sigh of relief. He was applauded again in the final seconds for his second save of the evening, but Lammens was never given another opportunity.",
      "\"It was certainly a successful debut for the Belgian goalkeeper. Manchester United secured only their third Premier League victory, and the young Belgian also secured their first clean sheet of the season for the Mancunians.",
      "\"Has the train departed? During the match, the home fans were already singing loudly for the goalkeeper: \"Are you Schmeichel in disguise?\" fans wondered aloud if Lammens wasn't just the former Danish legend of Man U.\"",

      "How often have we seen striker's come to Manchester United with plenty of fanfare and then fail to live up to the hype?",
      "If you are asking in recent times, too often to count. Each new addition has been brought in with the promise of being able to change United's fortunes around.",
      "Memphis Depay, Alexis Sanchez, Rasmus Hojlund were all signed to be the new main man at Old Trafford and have failed to live up to the hype. Benjamin Sesko received the same adulation when he signed for United and there was fears that the Slovenian was going to struggle with the weight of expectation.",
      "In his opening five Premier League matches he drew blanks. And while some questioned whether he was receiving adequate support from his teammates, there was a fear that Sesko was going to follow the same path as those who came before him.",
      "However, his first goal for the club at Brentford has swiftly been followed by his second against Sunderland. Now, there is a feeling of momentum behind the centre-forward and genuine hope that he can deliver where so few have.",
      "And yet, Sesko's admission following the victory over the Black Cats should leave the supporters excited to see what he can do moving forward. \"No, not yet,\" he responded to MUTV when asked if we were starting to see the best of him at United.",
      "\"There is loads [still] to come, definitely. I’m still getting used to it more and more, to read the players, to connect with them even more.",
      "\"I believe I can be even better and I will try to show it.\" This admission should excite fans as few can argue that Sesko, when given the opportunity, hasn't looked like an improvement on last season's options at centre-forward.",
      "If there is more to come from Sesko, United fans have every right to feel optimistic. A more consistent goal threat will be just the tonic for Ruben Amorim as he looks to change the Reds' fortunes.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

    "body": [
      "Casemiro made a beeline for Ruud van Nistelrooy in the Old Trafford tunnel on his return with Leicester City in February.",
      "Van Nistelrooy, a fluent Spanish speaker, was the conduit between Casemiro and Erik ten Hag after his Portuguese-speaking assistant Mitchell van der Gaag left. Van Nistelrooy started Casemiro in all four of his matches as caretaker manager. Casemiro lingered as Van Nistelrooy spoke, as attached to him as a comfort blanket.",
      "At that time, Casemiro had not started for United in 39 days. He did not get a kick between December 30, the night of the Newcastle United debacle, and January 30. He emerged on 70 minutes in Bucharest with United 2-0 up. The transfer window was still open but the chances of United shifting Casemiro were, like the Trinity test igniting the atmosphere, near zero.",
      "People at United's Carrington training complex noticed Casemiro's personality never wavered during a trying first half of the season. They have always found him to be a warm presence.",
      "His transformation at United in the past two months has been as unexpected as their 3-0 triumph in Bilbao. This is the midfielder who was dropped for last year's FA Cup final and replaced by Toby Collyer with United 2-0 down to Liverpool at half-time eight months ago. Casemiro’s declaration that he was keen to see out his contract in March was framed as more bad news for the club.",
      "Casemiro used his head before Athletic lost theirs in San Mames. Returning to Spain emboldens Casemiro. In San Sebastián and Bilbao, he has reminded Spanish audiences he can still cut it nearly three years on from leaving their shores. United supporters serenaded Casemiro on Thursday night.",
      "The draw with Real Sociedad in mid-March has marked a late turning point in Casemiro's third season in Manchester. With Manuel Ugarte out injured, Ruben Amorim had little choice but to turn to the older defensive midfielder.",
      "Casemiro has since been a fixture in the United starting XI, his importance highlighted by the early withdrawal at Bournemouth last week to preserve him for Bilbao. Ugarte admitted this week he is copying him.",
      "Within a matter of months, Casemiro has gone from unsellable to undroppable. If or when United reach the Europa League final, Casemiro is a shoo-in in midfield. The 3-4-2-1 system Amorim swears by has closed the yawning gaps that developed between the defence and midfield under Ten Hag and Casemiro has the safety net of a third centre back.",
      "United have adjusted Casemiro’s running and pressing triggers. “I think he has improved a lot also,” Amorim opined. “You can see not the way he plays but the way he runs. You can see it, we have the data to show him where he worked really hard.",
      "“He is a very good example. Even Toby sometimes was playing in front of him and [that] it is hard to take for Casemiro. So it is a lesson for all the players in Manchester United.",
      "“No matter what is the past or the last month, everything can change in one moment. Then we understood that he cannot jump all the time pressing high. We need to let him understand and sometimes it is better to put three defenders and let him be the fourth defender and put the wing-backs pressing high. These are all things we are understanding and trying to cope with all the criticisms of the team. But the credit is for Casemiro.”",
      "Amorim has been impressed by how hard Casemiro has worked to meet his demands to regain his place in the team. He noticed that he never complained during those winter weeks warming the bench.",
      "Selflessness is a natural trait of Casemiro's. It was also his undoing this time last year. With United depleted at centre half, he dropped back and was humiliated in the 4-0 drubbing by Crystal Palace.",
      "With Kobbie Mainoo and Christian Eriksen a flimsy shield and Jonny Evans his creaking partner, Casemiro abandoned his position to engage Michael Olise, overcommitted, lost his balance and Olise scored. Six days later, he trundled out of the United third and played Arsenal winger Gabriel Martinelli onside to square for Leandro Trossard’s tap-in. Sofyan Amrabat was ushered back in from the cold and played his way into the FA Cup final XI.",
      "Jamie Carragher urged Casemiro to “leave the football before the football leaves you”. Casemiro had been pencilled in to flank Amorim for pre-match press duties against Athletic and he would be a worthy choice at Carrington next week. He is a positive story again and one of the squad’s figureheads. United view Casemiro as a quiet leader, mind.",
      "The 33-year-old shared Raphael Varane’s view that a “disconnect” had developed between the players and Ten Hag. It is not a coincidence that Casemiro scored two goals in the first game after Ten Hag was finally sacked. He was committed enough to claim the last goal of the Ten Hag era at West Ham.",
      "When Casemiro discussed the possibility of joining United, he wanted to know three things: where he would live, where he would train and where the stadium was. During FaceTime conversations, he requested to see the club’s gymnasium at Carrington.",
      "United sources have been struck by how leaner Casemiro is this season. People in Madrid said Casemiro used to be in the club's Valdebebas gym at 8am and he often has gym sessions before and after training at Carrington.",
      "Casemiro has struck up a close rapport with some of the masseurs and his English is now a very good level of conversational. He understood our questions in the mixed zone two years ago, when his handshake grip was as tight as a vice. Casemiro's wife, Anna, and children Sara and Caio, are happy in Manchester amid the prospect of a fourth year in England's north west.",
      "Staff at Carrington regard Casemiro as one of the most respectful players they have encountered and that he is strident in protecting the club's image. Sir Jim Ratcliffe dubbed Casemiro as \"overpaid\" and \"not good enough\" in March. Three days later, Casemiro trumped his first-leg performance against Sociedad in the 4-1 win at Old Trafford.",
      "His steep decline over 18 months - dropped for Amrabat, substituted for Collyer, omitted from the Brazil squad - makes Casemiro’s revival so singular. If United win the Europa League it would be churlish to argue someone who has won three trophies in three seasons has been an unsuccessful signing.",
      "Casemiro drove United to a successful 2022-23 season. Without him, they would not have qualified for the Champions League. Ten Hag dubbed him the “cement between the stones”, essentially the glue in the team. Casemiro was central to the Latino rebranding of the United defence that kept the most clean sheets in the Premier League.",
      "Casemiro has returned to that level of influence he wielded in his first season. In Europe, at least. The concern if United do not triumph in Bilbao again this month is Casemiro could be redundant in a campaign devoid of Champions League midweeks. His recent domestic form has been inoffensive but not stellar and United need a young and dynamic new central midfielder in the summer.",
      "The senior figures made the difference in Bilbao, though. Casemiro and Bruno Fernandes, two 30-something Portuguese speakers, are naturally close.",
      "“We've got a lot of senior players who need to step up in their moments,” Harry Maguire explained. “I think Case was brilliant tonight. Bruno as well. So we have senior players who need to handle these moments really well.”",
      "Van Nistelrooy, a champion of Casemiro’s, merits credit for that.",

      "Manchester United midfielder Bruno Fernandes feels a meeting with Ireland goalkeeper Caoimhin Kelleher is a good opportunity to “settle scores” after he missed a penalty against him earlier this season.",
      "Fernandes has been one of United‘s very best players since he joined them in 2020. The attacking midfielder has been directly involved in 186 goals in 298 games for the Red Devils.",
      "He has been their designated penalty taker for most of his time there, and in the Premier League, he’s scored 23 of those spot kicks, and missed six.",
      "But this season, Fernandes’ record from the spot is pretty woeful, as he’s scored just one of three efforts.",
      "He scored against Burnley, skied one against Fulham and saw Brentford goalkeeper Kelleher save his attempt in a 3-1 loss.",
      "Fernandes will come up against Kelleher for Portugal against Ireland on Saturday, and thus his penalty record has been brought up.",
      "Fernandes said: “This season, out of three, I ended up missing two. I don’t want to miss any of them. It’s something I need to study better. I’ll always do it with full conviction because there’s a coach who trusts me.",
      "“Every day is a good day to settle scores.",
      "“He was stronger. He did very well, and I didn’t. But it’s not something that affects my head. In a football team, there’s something bigger than individuality. Winning is much more important than settling scores with the Irish goalkeeper.”",
      "Portugal have full points from their two World Cup qualification games so far, but Fernandes is yet to have a direct hand in a goal.",
      "He played 90 minutes in the 5-0 victory over Armenia and neither scored nor assisted, before he again blanked in a 66-minute outing against Hungary.",
      "In three games against Ireland in his career, he’s assisted once and not scored.",
      "But the midfielder’s assist came in his last outing against Ireland, so he’ll be hoping not only that he can put his woes against Kelleher behind him, but that he can carry the form from his last match against them with him.",
      "Fernandes has also revealed that he has no immediate plans to move away from United.",
      "He said: “I didn’t close the door on moving to Saudi Arabia because of the World Cup.",
      "“That was never in my mind. I wanted to stay at Manchester United, and the club wanted me to stay. That’s all there is to it.”",
      "Bruno Fernandes insists leaving Man Utd for Saudi Arabia is an “impossible scenario to imagine” but admits he’s “no idea if there’s any truth” to the links.",
      "Transfer expert Fabrizio Romano has revealed that Man Utd defender Tyrell Malacia “will leave” in 2026 as he brings an update on Bruno Fernandes’ future.",
      "Fabrizio Romano has insisted that there is “nothing concrete” in rumours that Man Utd captain Bruno Fernandes will move to Saudi Arabia next summer.",
      "According to reports, Bruno Fernandes and Manchester United have already ‘agreed’ his £100m ‘sale’ and this deal will fund two ‘incoming’ signings.",
      "Manchester United have reportedly made a ‘shock U-turn’ on captain Bruno Fernandes after he was linked with a summer move to the Saudi Pro League.",
      "Manchester United are braced for offers from Saudi Arabia for club captain Bruno Fernandes in January, according to reports."

      "It could be in the Glazer family’s interest to sell Man Utd ‘before February 2027’ amid takeover rumours, according to reports.",
      "Saudi government official Turki Al-Sheikh caused a stir earlier this week when he suggested that the Red Devils were close to bringing a new investor on board.",
      "Keeping tight-lipped about the details of the deal, Al-Sheikh wrote on X: ‘The best news I heard today is that Manchester United is now in an advanced stage of completing a deal to sell to a new investor – I hope he’s better than the previous owners.’",
      "The Glazers sold 27.7 per cent of Man Utd to Sir Jim Ratcliffe back in February 2024 with the INEOS founder given control of football operations.",

      "Ratcliffe is looking to win the Premier League by 2028 and move Man Utd into a new 100,000-seater stadium as soon as possible.",
      "However, there could be a possibility that Ratcliffe could now be bought out with Al-Sheikh insisting that he is “not the investor”.",
      "Clarifying his message earlier in the week, Al-Sheikh wrote on X: “My yesterday’s post about Manchester United’s potential sale meant one thing: the club is in an advanced negotiation phase with a new investor.",
      "“Just to clarify, I am not the investor, nor are they from my nation. I’m posting this as a fan who wishes the deal to happen, though it might not necessarily happen.”",
      "And now The Athletic have explained ‘the context of this week’s reports and what they could mean’ and whether the Glazers could look to sell.",
      "The report claims: ‘Whether they have an appetite to sell or not is the several-billion-dollar question, but the terms of the agreement with Ratcliffe arguably make it in the family’s interest to do so before February 2027.",
      "‘Until then, as detailed above, Ratcliffe will be guaranteed to earn at least $33 per share for his stake if dragged. The Glazers would expect at least the same for their shares, thereby raising the floor of any deal.’",
      "The Athletic insist the club’s minimum valuation is £4.3bn with the report naming Sheikh Jassim, a United Arab Emirates-based consortium and Elon Musk as potential buyers, although they did not say if there was definitely still interest from any of those parties.",
      "Man Utd co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe could be “forced” to sack Ruben Amorim over results despite his claim that he’s ready to give him three years.",
      "Man Utd boss Ruben Amorim will not be sacked yet but there are reportedly still dissenting voices who want the Red Devils to talk to other managers.",
      "The man in charge of United’s football operations wants to give Amorim three years but there has been little to show he deserves that.",
      "It has been suggested that a Manchester United takeover is ‘advanced’ as a new report has revealed the real bidder and a ‘whopping’ demand.",
      "According to reports, the Glazer family have already set a Manchester United ‘sale’ price amid interest from Saudi Arabia.",

Does Mr Bowler believe that every flag, once erected, must stay up forever? Would they not get fairly tatty?",
      "This flag, in particular, was on some scaffolding on a building site owned by Gary Neville. Does this mean the scaffolding has to stay up on the property until the end of time, long after the construction is concluded, for fear of disturbing the precious flag that has been tied to it? Does he know how much scaffolding costs? Has he not been following the news about steel shortages? Won’t he think of the impact on the construction industry?",
      "Could the wondrous, beauteous Union Flag, a symbol of peace, justice and love worldwide, become like one of those endangered newts? Could environmentalists stop developments on, say wetlands, by the expeditious method of tying a flag to them, therefore rendering areas of natural beauty inviolate until the VERY END OF TIME ITSELF?",

      "‘Peter Bowler’ – a flag isn’t representative of this nation at all. It’s just a bit of fabric with some colours on; it is a symbol, and as with every symbol its meaning comes from how it’s used and who by. What it represents can change at the drop of a (Bowler) hat. 30 years ago, if I’d started tying flags to lampposts showing the colours of the rainbow, most people would have assumed I was in favour of leprechauns, or Teletubbies, or Zippy and Bungle, etc. What’s that idiot doing up a ladder with that flag? He must really like Dark Side of the Moon to go to all that effort.",

Between the cor blimeying and bloody door blowing of The Italian Job, did viewers think the football songs, flags, and red, white and blue Minis were the coming of the new Reich? Nobody saw Noel Gallagher playing a UJ guitar at the height of Britpop and thought, this is bad, it’s obviously jackboots next. Were we all watching Mo Farah, Jess E-H, Greg Rutherford wearing flags round their shoulders during their 2012 victory laps and screeching, will no-one rid me of these turbulent racists? I tell you what, that Roger Moore skiing off a cliff and opening a Union Jack parachute? Disgusting.",

Yes, most people realised something was very amiss at that point. Obviously, a lot of us – myself included – didn’t want to see it in his case, and quite merrily ignored the Asian Ruts and the Pregnant for the Last Times; but eventually you have to see what’s in front of your face. If Reform councillors get elected and immediately take down Pride flags – symbols of, more than anything else, a plea for tolerance and acceptance – whatever goes up in their place can only represent intolerance and exclusion. And what did they put up? The Gammon Bat Signal itself.",
      "There isn’t a symbolism committee that meets to decide these things; meaning is not handed down by Ed Miliband on giant stone tablets, we all just make it up as we go. Look up the word ‘literally’ in the dictionary to see that these things can get complicated. So, you can pretend the meaning of the flag isn’t changing, and you’re not changing it. Life may be easier psychologically if you tell yourself that the flag doesn’t mean anything deep; there’s no subtext to anything; flying the UJ is just a plain statement of fact – it’s just reminding people what country they’re in. On a par with tying a flag to a lamppost that says, this is a lamppost. What are people annoyed about? Nobody gets ‘triggered’ when they see place names on a road sign do they? What’s all the fuss about?",
      "But whether you know it or not, it’s reflecting you and your personality. It’s reflecting your actions in public and how you speak about the world. And if that flag is a big piece of cloth with your face on it, then fine – you get to own that, nobody else is involved. But if you’re telling everyone that this is their flag too, their country, and their values, the answer is No. Nobody asked us to sign up to how this is being used; nobody tying flags to railings and then pissing in the street straight afterwards asked for my opinion beforehand; nobody setting hotels on fire stopped to enquire if the people – be they white, middle-aged, angry or whatever else – are alright with this.",

      "Michael Owen says it’s “embarrassing” to blame all of Manchester United’s struggles on Ruben Amorim’s three-at-the-back system.",
      "Man Utd have only accumulated 37 points from Amorim’s 34 Premier League matches in charge.",
      "There was speculation that a bad result against Sunderland in the Red Devils’ last match would get Amorim sacked, but the head coach led his side to a 2-0 win at Old Trafford.",
      "A crucial home victory and a first clean sheet of the season are enough to relieve some pressure on the Portuguese during the international break, but Man Utd’s performances this season have been extremely disappointing.",
      "They are currently tenth in the Premier League with three wins, one draw, and three defeats from their opening seven games, with the club’s stuttering start to 2025/26 being attributed to Amorim’s tactical stubbornness.",
      "Amorim has stuck rigidly to his favoured 3-4-2-1 formation, and club legends Gary Neville and Wayne Rooney are among those to criticise the Red Devils boss for showing a lack of adaptability, or a lack of desire to adapt.",
      "Former Man Utd striker Owen thinks blaming the club’s poor form isn’t solely down to Amorim’s 3-4-2-1 philosophy, and has actually defended the 40-year-old head coach.",
      "“They have changed the manager numerous times since Fergie left,” Owen said.",
      "“Then they blamed the players; spent billions on players and got some of the best players in the world, only for the club to be seen as a bit of a graveyard for players in the last decade.",
      "“Next it was the people buying the players, so everyone wanted rid of them. Then it was the board, so the board was shuffled around when Sir Jim Ratcliffe got involved.",
      "“Then it’s the fault of the facilities so they wanted to revamp the training ground and put plans in for a new stadium.",
      "“Then it’s the staff, so half the backroom staff, physios, doctors, canteen lady, the whole thing, wiped clean and a new start there.",
      "“The latest one is it’s because they’re playing a back-three. If I’m not wrong, I watched Erik Ten Hag about a year ago playing a back-four, and it was some of the most awful football I’ve ever seen from a Manchester United team.",
      "“Some great teams over the years have played with a back-three. I’m not saying that’s my favourite formation at all, and I’m not saying that Amorim is right to be steadfast in his beliefs in that formation. But I certainly don’t think all of United’s problems now are because they play with the back-three.",
      "“It’s embarrassing if you’re going to say the main reason for the downturn is because they play a back-three. I mean, it really isn’t. They could go back to a back-four and play as bad as they did under Ten Hag, then the screams would be equally as loud.”",
      "Amorim has voiced his concerns that negative comments from pundits about his system might be influencing his players, and Owen thinks that is possible.",
      "“I could totally buy that,” he said. “Players aren’t sheltered away from everything.",
      "“They’re driving cars to training, putting the radio on. They sit at home in the lounge with the TV on. They read social media. They can do all these things. If you’re interested in football, you can’t get away from what people are thinking and saying about it.",
      "“Whether footballers should be swayed by those comments or impacted by them, that’s a different argument. But I’ve got no doubt that people will watch and will listen to people they probably respected and thought were great players growing up. They’ll listen to those opinions.",
      "“If they’re saying certain things, then it might enter their head, and they could perhaps wonder if the manager is doing the right thing. They might have their own ideas, but that’s not a new phenomenon.",
      "“That will never change. It never has changed, but I do think it is a relevant point to make by Amorim.”",
      "READ NEXT: Elliot Anderson to Man Utd or Newcastle set ‘extortionate’ price that’s *actually* a real bargain…",
      "Manchester United are ‘too big’ to struggle, are they? Michael Owen reckons so. We’ve only been saying this for over a decade…",
      "Liverpool boss Arne Slot hit out at one of his players for costing his side against Crystal Palace, while another player “didn’t know what he was doing”.",
      "Harry Kane has responded to Michael Owen’s claim that he is “nuts” for leaving the Premier League to join Bayern Munich in 2023.",
      "Michael Owen has shut down any debate that Wayne Rooney was better than him at 17 years old with some cold, hard evidence.",
      "Liverpool have been tipped by a Premier League icon to win the treble this season, while one of their new signings has been touted to be the league’s player of ...",
      "Ex-Liverpool striker Michael Owen has made a Premier League title prediction, while he has also called Arsenal and Chelsea’s final 2025/26 positions."

      "“We know Ratcliffe has said that he wants to give him three years to get things right, prove himself.",
      "“If the results don’t improve in the meantime, the pressure will just grow and grow, and once that happens, you normally do have a change of managers.",
      "“Results will dictate what Ruben Amorim’s future is at Old Trafford.”",
      "Man Utd legend Roy Keane has put forward Atletico Madrid boss Diego Simeone as the perfect fit for the Red Devils if they do sack Amorim.",
      "Keane said on The Overlap: “I’ve said it for years, I’d like Atletico Madrid’s Simeone to go in there. I’d like to see him go there. I know his mate has gone to Arsenal [Andrea Berta, the Gunners’ sporting director who recently left Atletico].",
      "“I think he would just create havoc, but good havoc. He’d rock up to that place. No guarantees, but I’d just like to see his personality, his track record.",
      "“People might think styles of football, [but] they scored five against Real Madrid [winning 5-2] last weekend. He doesn’t like his teams giving up too many goals or chances, but they can play a bit and fight.",
      "“At Liverpool [where Atletico lost 3-2 in the Champions League] a few weeks ago… the team aren’t as great as few years ago, but they still had fighting spirit. He’s on the sideline, he got sent off that night, I’d like a big personality.”",

      "It comes after Ruben Amorim could only guide Man Utd to a 15th-placed Premier League finish last term with the Red Devils failing to qualify for any European competitions.",
      "One player who has dropped down the pecking order under Amorim is Mainoo with the Man Utd boss angering club officials by revealing that the England international would be competing with Bruno Fernandes for a starting spot this season.",

      "The report adds: ‘Mainoo is unhappy with this start to the season and is pushing for a January transfer, even on loan. The Englishman’s short-term goal, in fact, is to show off his skills and secure a place in Tuchel’s squad for the next World Cup. Manchester isn’t the right platform, but Napoli could be.’",
      "Earlier this season, former Man Utd team-mate Phil Jones insists that if his lack of game time continues then Mainoo will look to force a move away from Old Trafford.",

      "The 22-year-old was one of the breakout stars in the Premier League last season, as his sudden emergence as one of the division’s best defensive midfielders helped them secure European qualification.",

      "Manchester United legend Wayne Rooney has hit back at former Liverpool star Steven Gerrard after his comments on England’s golden generation.",
      "Despite the Three Lions oozing with talented players in the 2000s, England failed to get to the final of a major tournament with Fabio Capello and Sven-Goran Eriksson failing to get the best out of the players.",
      "David Beckham, Steven Gerrard, Paul Scholes, Frank Lampard, Gary Neville, Rio Ferdinand, Wayne Rooney, John Terry and Jamie Carragher are just some of the players who were at the disposal of the managers.",
      "Their failure to win anything in the first decade or so of the 2000s was put down to players failing to put club rivalries aside with Manchester United, Liverpool, Chelsea and Arsenal fighting for the same trophies.",
      "Gerrard recently admitted that was one issue with the former Liverpool midfielder insisting that the England squad back then was full of “egotistical losers”.",

      "“I watch the telly now and I see Jamie Carragher sitting next to Paul Scholes and they look like they’ve been best mates for 20 years.",
      "“And I see Carragher’s relationship with Gary Neville and they look like they’ve been mates for 20 years. I’m probably more close and friendly with you [Ferdinand] now than I ever was when I played with you for 15 years [for England].",
      "“So why didn’t we connect when we were 20, 21, 22, 23? Was it ego? Was it rivalry?",
      "“It was down to the culture within England. We weren’t friendly or connected. We weren’t a team. We never at any stage became a real good, strong team.",
      "“I hated it. I didn’t enjoy it. Hated the [hotel] rooms.",
      "“In my early days, I’d have days where I was down, like low down. Like I’m in this room for seven hours, what am I going to do?",
      "“There was no social media, we didn’t have a DVD player or anything. Channel 1 to 5 or whatever it was on TV. I used to get low and down.",
      "“I used to love the games. I used to love playing for England. I was really proud. I used to enjoy the training sessions but it was 90 minutes a day. And then I was just on my own.",
      "“I didn’t feel part of a team. I didn’t feel connected with my team-mates, with England.",
      "“I didn’t feel that with Liverpool. They were the best days of my life. I felt like the staff looked over me, like I felt special. I felt like I couldn’t wait to get there. With England, I just wanted the games and the training sessions and then to be away.”",

      "To put it into context, if Amorim had now been at United for three years, it would make him the fifth-longest-serving manager in the Premier League, just ahead of Unai Emery. And the current Aston Villa boss is a sign that in the modern game, you simply don’t get to three years without real progress.",
      "Emery took Aston Villa to Europe after Steven Gerrard looked like he may take them down. Eddie Howe did similar at Newcastle. Marco Silva has guided Fulham up from the Championship and made them a steady Premier League side.",

      "Ratcliffe described Arteta’s opening years at Arsenal as “miserable”, no doubt ‘informed’ by their back-to-back eighth-placed finishes, but crucially, there were signs of progress even in the early days.",
      "Emery’s stint at Arsenal was characterised by throwing away leads and gifting opposition goals; Arteta’s 18 clean sheets in his first 50 games demonstrate where he improved Arsenal the most.",
      "When Jurgen Klopp arrived at Liverpool, they too had a leaking defence. When Brendan Rodgers was sacked following a 1-1 draw at Goodison, Liverpool had a -2 goal difference, conceding 1.25 goals every game. In Klopp’s first 50 games, he brought that down to 1.02 and kept it there for his whole Liverpool tenure.",
      "For both Arsenal and Liverpool, there were clear signs of progress from a playing style aspect, and soon the results began to follow. Arteta may have finished eighth in both of his opening seasons, but he achieved five more points in his second campaign and Ratcliffe’s “miserable” assessment ignores their FA Cup win in 2020.",
      "In 2021/22, the Gunners rose to fifth and their big leap came in 2022/23 when they reached second in Arteta’s third full season in charge. Liverpool also came in eighth in Klopp’s first season and in the following year, they were up to fourth.",
      "Meanwhile, Manchester United have shown very little signs of any progress, either from a points or playing style perspective.",
      "Amorim’s predecessor Erik ten Hag averaged 1.84 points per game with 1.83 goals scored per game and 1.41 conceded. Amorim meanwhile may have a better scoring record at 1.94 per game, but they also concede a lot more at 1.9 per game. His points per game is also 1.38, 0.46 less than Ten Hag. And that was ‘miserable’.",
      "The former Sporting boss may not have had the full season with the squad but Amorim took a side that was 14th and pushed them one spot lower to 15th.",
      "Then there is the tactical reluctance. His devotion to 3-4-2-1 is unbreakable, so much so that not even the Pope could convince him otherwise, and in his 50 games for United, on only five occasions have the team not lined up like that. And even then it was a 3-4-3.",
      "A devotion to a philosophy is nothing new and not inherently bad for a football manager, but you need only look at the way Pep Guardiola has changed his system over the years to keep up with changing trends.",
      "When he arrived at City in 2016, only three players were taller than 1.9m, two of them goalkeepers. Now, that number is at six. Over the years we have seen changes like inverting full-backs, a move away from 4-3-3 towards a 4-2-2-2 when in possession and more from Guardiola. His first season had many saying he could not cope with English football after a couple of hammerings, but mid-season tweaks meant they went unbeaten in the last eight games of the year.",
      "Guardiola was of course helped by City’s spending, but it is not as if United have not splashed the cash either. The key difference is that City’s signings fixed obvious holes in the team, while United have still been left with gaping chasms, mainly in midfield.",
      "Amorim has dug his own grave and Ratcliffe has pinned his colours to the mast of what may well be a sinking ship.",
      "The man in charge of United’s football operations often likes to portray himself as a fan, one that used to stand on the terraces, more than your typical Premier League owner, and this desire for patience may be him harking back to days of yore, but if you’re backing a dead horse for 11 months or three years, it is still not going to be winning any races.",
      "Amorim may well come good and United may well start winning titles again, but there has been very little evidence to suggest that, and Ratcliffe’s dedication for now seems more based on hope than it is on the reality playing out in front of him.",

      "The goals scored columns are nearly identical, with Arsenal scoring 79 times to Manchester United's 78 under Amorim. But there is a big difference in goals conceded, with Amorim's side having let in nearly 60 per cent more than Arsenal, on 76.",
      "Arsenal kept 18 clean sheets in Arteta's first 50 games, hinting at his capacity to make the side more difficult to beat. Manchester United, by contrast, have only managed eight shut-outs under Amorim. They have conceded three or more goals on nine occasions, something that only happened three times in Arteta's first 50 games at Arsenal.",
      "Arteta inherited a team sitting 10th in the Premier League when he took the Arsenal job in December 2019. Manchester United were lower, in 14th, when Amorim took over at Manchester United.",
      "Arteta oversaw slight improvement relative to his starting position, although Arsenal's eighth-placed finish at the end of his first campaign, which included the interruption of the Covid pandemic, was the club's lowest since coming 10th in 1992/93.",
      "Manchester United finished even lower than the position in which Amorim found them at the end of his first season, coming 15th in a record-low for the club, with a points total of 42 to Arsenal's 56 in Arsenal's first season under Arteta.",
      "Both managers reached cup finals at the end of their first seasons. But while Arteta guided Arsenal to FA Cup success, beating Chelsea in the final having overcome Manchester City in the last four, Amorim suffered Europa League disappointment against Spurs.",
      "Arteta was unable to improve on Arsenal's eighth-placed finish in his first full season in charge, with Arsenal ending up in the same spot in the table. They were ninth at the time of his 50th game, a 3-0 loss to Liverpool at the Emirates Stadium in April 2021, only a place higher than Manchester United's position at Amorim's half-century.",
      "Arteta showed pragmatism in winning the FA Cup, moving away from his favoured 4-2-3-1, which has subsequently evolved into a 4-3-3, and instead using a back three, a change he said was intended to make the most of the players at his disposal at that time.",
      "Amorim has taken a more rigid approach, sticking to his favoured 3-4-2-1, despite external pressure to adapt his system. While Arteta showed variation in his starting formations in his first 50 games, Amorim has used a back three consistently, the only variation from 3-4-2-1 being 3-4-3, which he has used five times.",
      "Bukayo Saka is the only player from Arteta's first Arsenal line-up still at the club this season. The England international was used as a left-back in their 1-1 draw with Bournemouth on Boxing Day in 2019.",
      "There has been turnover at Manchester United under Amorim too, albeit in a shorter time frame, with five players who started the 1-1 draw with Ipswich in his first game in November of last year having gone, either on loan or permanently, in Andre Onana, Jonny Evans, Christian Eriksen, Alejandro Garnacho and Marcus Rashford.",
      "The pace of change was relatively slow initially for Arteta at Arsenal, although he was able to include Gabriel Magalhaes, Martin Odegaard and Thomas Partey in his team for the defeat to Liverpool at the Emirates Stadium in his 50th game.",
      "Amorim enjoyed a win to mark his half-century as Manchester United beat Sunderland 2-0 last weekend with a starting line-up which included three new signings.",
      "Arsenal's transfer spending has ramped up in recent years, culminating in this summer's record £257m spend. But the club's outlay was more modest over the course of Arteta's first 50 games.",
      "Arteta mostly had to rely on loan signings and free transfers, with spending totalling only £81.5m across two transfer windows. Partey and Gabriel were the only players signed for significant fees.",
      "Manchester United have brought in fewer players under Amorim but spent considerably more in transfer fees, with Benjamin Sesko, Bryan Mbeumo, Matheus Cunha, Senne Lemmens, Diego Leon and Ayden Heaven arriving for a combined £232.4m, dwarfing Arsenal's figure in Arteta's first two transfer windows.",
      "As for sales, Arsenal only received a fee for one player during Arteta's first 50 games, with Emiliano Martinez sold to Aston Villa for £17m.",
      "Manchester United have been more successful on that front, recouping £61.7m from the sales of Garnacho and Antony.",

      "Man Utd head coach Ruben Amorim is under pressure after a mixed start to the season followed last term's 15th-placed finish; Man Utd's minority owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe has given him a huge vote of support: \"Ruben needs to demonstrate he is a great coach over three years.\"",
      "Thursday 9 October 2025 07:24, UK",
      "Manchester United minority owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe has said he wants to give under-pressure head coach Ruben Amorim three years in the job to prove himself.",
      "Amorim is approaching the first anniversary of his appointment at Old Trafford, but his position has been under constant scrutiny since he took over on November 1 last year.",
      "He has failed to record back-to-back Premier League wins during that time, coming 15th last season - their worst top-flight finish since 1974 - and things have not improved much since the summer as United were knocked out of the Carabao Cup by League Two Grimsby in August.",
      "That has led to suggestions Amorim's job is under threat, but Ratcliffe said the 40-year-old is a \"good guy\" and has time to turn things around.",
      "\"Ruben needs to demonstrate he is a great coach over three years,\" he told The Business podcast, produced by The Times and The Sunday Times.",
      "Asked if Amorim is going to get three years, Ratcliffe replied: \"Yes. That is where I would be. Three years. Because football is not overnight.",
      "\"It's three years. You also look at [Mikel] Arteta at Arsenal. He had a miserable time over the first couple of years.",
      "\"We have to be patient. We have a long-term plan. It isn't a light switch.",
      "\"You can't run a club like Manchester United on knee-jerk reactions to some journalist who goes off on one every week.\"",
      "Ratcliffe has owned just under 30 per cent of United through his chemicals company INEOS since February 2024, taking over control of football operations at the club.",
      "That still left the Glazer family, who have been the subject of numerous fan protests over their handling of the club since taking over in 2005, in overall charge.",
      "Asked what would happen if the Glazers told him to sack Amorim, Ratcliffe said: \"It's not going to happen.\"",
      "The INEOS boss added the Glazers were happy for him to take charge, adding: \"That probably sums it up. We're local and they're the other side of the pond.",
      "\"That's a long way away to try and manage a football club as big and complex as Manchester United. We're here with feet on the ground.",
      "\"They [the Glazers] get a bad rap... but they are really nice people and they are really passionate about the club.\"",
      "Ratcliffe has come in for criticism of his own after controversial cuts designed to drive down costs saw around 450 jobs axed and the removal of perks like subsidised staff lunches.",
      "\"The costs were just too high. There are some fantastic people at Manchester United, but there was also a level of mediocrity and it had become bloated,\" he said.",
      "\"I got a lot of flak for the free lunches, but no one's ever given me a free lunch.",
      "\"The biggest correlation, like it or not, between results and any external factor - is profitability. The more cash you have got, the better squad you can build.",
      "\"So a lot of what we have done in the first year is spend an awful lot of time putting the club on a sustainable, healthy footing.",
      "\"We're not seeing all the benefits of the restructuring that we've done in this set of (financial) results (United last month reported record revenues of £666.5million for last season but a loss of £33million for the financial year) and we were not in the Champions League.",
      "\"Those numbers will get better. Manchester United will become the most profitable football club in the world, in my view, and from that will stem, I hope, a long-term, sustainable, high-level of football.\"",
      "Ratcliffe says he wants to give his first managerial appointment at Old Trafford three years to prove himself as a \"great coach\" and that patience extends to the players.",
      "United's director of football Jason Wilcox has canvassed the opinion of some of the United players - as he would in normal conversations around the training ground - and the consensus is that the squad are happy with Amorim.",
      "Of course, there is empathy and understanding that perhaps the likes of Kobbie Mainoo and Joshua Zirkzee, for example, may not be fully content with the lack of game time they have had so far this season.",
      "But, for the most part, it seems clear, as of now, that the Portuguese has the backing of the group - some of whom, most notably Bryan Mbeumo and Mason Mount, have said so publicly in recent interviews.",
      "\"We all know how football works. Before the next international break, Man Utd have got four games, Liverpool, Brighton, Forest and Spurs.",
      "\"What happens if they lose all those games? There will be another international break. Everybody will be talking about Ruben Amorim's future again.",
      "\"This is a very significant intervention by Jim Ratcliffe to come out and back Ruben Amorim. I personally think the backing is not 100 per cent. If you actually look at the quotes, he's not coming out and saying come what may, Ruben Amorim is not leaving. He will be the head coach for the next three years.",
      "\"He's just saying 'Ruben needs to demonstrate he's a great coach over three years'. 'We have to be patient'. 'We have a long-term plan'. 'It isn't a light switch'.",
      "\"It's not a light switch, but Manchester United are one of the biggest clubs in the world. I would say the only clubs that really compare to them on a worldwide basis are Real Madrid and Barcelona.",
      "\"What would journalists in Spain who cover Real Madrid or Barcelona be saying if Real Madrid finished 15th in the table? What would they be saying if their new manager was bottom of the table when it came to results since he'd taken over?\"",

      "Mason Mount, selected ahead of Matheus Cunha, scored a fine opening goal before Benjamin Sesko netted at Old Trafford for the first time in front of his home supporters. Sunderland struggled to cope and even switched to 3-4-3 in a bid to alter the flow.",

      "Mason Mount's opener for Manchester United against Sunderland rounded off an 18-pass move, the joint-most for a goal in the Premier League this season.",
      "Lammens' best save came late in the game when he kept out a Chemsdine Talbi effort with his legs but the Belgian goalkeeper was hardly overworked. There were bigger cheers when he claimed a cross in stoppage time, his second good claim of the game.",
      "Manchester United kept their first clean sheet of the season in what was also Senne Lammens' debut for the club.",
      "How United need that sort of commanding presence in goal with supporters unconvinced by the performances of Altay Bayindir. Lammens, signed from Antwerp late in the window, also looked composed when kicking with his right and left foot.",
      "There was one hairy moment when he chased out of his goal on the angle only to see Traore get there first amid some uncertainty with Fernandes. But as debuts go, this was a fine effort from a 23-year-old goalkeeper with a huge task ahead of him.",
      "Manchester United head coach Ruben Amorim in the press conference:",
      "\"I think he looked confident in the first game. But the important thing is that the teammates helped Senne to have a good game. Because everyone was focused, not a lot of mistakes against a team that was really comfortable playing football.\"",
      "Asked why he delayed starting him, Amorim added: \"He arrives and you can feel it that he needs to adapt. New country, new training, the pressure that you guys put on the goalkeepers are massive. So it was like a little preparation for the guy to be ready to start his first game.",
      "\"But now it's just one game and he needs to work. Because he needs to be prepared that in our club things are really hard. But he did well in the game. He was comfortable during the game and that is a very good sign.\"",
      "Asked whether the international break denies United the opportunity to build momentum, Amorim joked that \"there is no momentum with our team\" - a reference to the fact that they are still looking for back-to-back Premier League wins under him.",
      "But Amorim was encouraged by the performance. When asked about Mount's comments that the players were 100 per cent behind their coach, the Portuguese suggested that the performance was proof of that.",
      "\"I saw it today. And I know they want to do the best and I know they don't want to change the coach all the time.",
      "\"We need to show with actions. Sometimes when we look at our team, I know for sure that when we see the games in the end I know sometimes we can do better. I feel it during the week but we need to show it on the pitch.\"",
      "It is easy to talk about heart, about shape, about defending with your lives - something which has provided the platform for some impressive results for Sunderland against Crystal Palace and Nottingham Forest. But resolve only gets you so far.",
      "At some point, you have to hurt teams and possess quality in the final third. And at Old Trafford, Sunderland looked woefully short in that department, creating just 0.71 worth of expected goals and rarely testing Lammens, who would have been feeling it ahead of his United debut.",
      "And while it's fair to say United were efficient rather than exceptional once racing into their 2-0, the gap in quality was undeniable. This was a bit of a reality check. A performance that strips back the optimism and lays bare the challenge ahead of survival.",

      "Ruben Amorim said he has no plans to walk away from the Manchester United job and insisted his system is not to blame for their struggles in an impassioned press conference.",
      "HIs side face Sunderland on Saturday having suffered a third Premier League loss of the season against Brentford which left them 14th in the table and increased the pressure on the head coach.",
      "Ahead of Saturday's game at Old Trafford, read the full transcript as Amorim outlines his determination to turn Manchester United's form around, denies reports he is unhappy in Manchester, and argues that he used 4-4-2, rather than a back three, against Brentford.",
      "AMORIM: \"Because the worst thing in this job is to not win games. That is the same feeling I had in Casa Pia when I lost in the third division.",
      "\"And then it's a job. Of course, it's a dream to be here. And I want to continue here. And I want to fight for this. But the problem is now, what makes me suffer is to lose games, not to lose my job.",
      "\"You fear to lose your job when you have to pay the bills and I don't have that feeling. I just want to continue this. But when we don't win games, that is the suffering that I have. It is not the fear of losing the job. I don't care.",
      "\"I'm telling you when we finish the game and you can see me, I don't care about my job. That hurt of not winning games or failing. That is the thing that hurts me the most.\"",
      "AMORIM: \"That is a decision of the board. I cannot do that. Sometimes I have that feeling and losing is hard. It's so frustrating when you create the momentum, go to the next game, and something happens.",
      "\"That feeling sometimes hurts me a lot. Also the players and especially the staff here.",
      "\"But that is not my decision. And I think it would be really hard to leave if I don't do everything to follow my career here.\"",
      "AMORIM: \"It's really important because there is no one in the world that can read everything and listen to everything about people that understand football and not be influenced by that.",
      "\"So I'm trying to listen and to see all the games because I know that I see the game more times than all those guys together because they have to see all the games in the Premier League and give an opinion.",
      "\"My opinion is completely different because I see the games, I see the training, I understand my players, I understand what I'm doing and I follow my job this way because it's impossible to survive in this club, listening to all the things.",
      "\"I see a lot of things that my wife is talking with the media. That is such nonsense.",
      "\"Nobody in my family talks about that. We love living in England. You have no idea what is abuse here because you are so polite compared to my country where we are losing. So you have no idea. My family is really happy.",
      "\"It's just me and my family that is struggling because I hate losing and I hate failing.\"",
      "AMORIM: \"I'm not concerned about that and nobody here is naive. We understand that we need results to continue the project.",
      "\"We will reach a point that is impossible for everyone because this is a very big club with a lot of sponsors, with two owners. So it's hard. That balance is really hard. So I'm not concerned about that.",
      "\"What I want is to see my team winning or losing playing the same way and we are not doing that, in the simple things of playing football that anyone can do.",
      "\"So my biggest problem is [if] my players believe in you guys when they say the problem of our team is the system.",
      "\"I get crazy about that because I can see the team, I see this team playing in a different system.",
      "\"We need to play the same way with the same power with the same intensity with the same focus. If you do that, the system doesn't matter.\"",
      "AMORIM: \"It doesn't matter. I just need one more game because football is like that. We need one more game, we win, we get some hope and then in the next game we'll see.",
      "\"That is always the same thing, so I don't need a lot of time. It doesn't matter for me, it's just the next game that matters and the next game is [Saturday]. We just have to perform and we need to win.\"",
      "AMORIM: \"It's the results. Imagine that we won the first game against Arsenal and then you don't miss the penalty and you win against Fulham, even without playing really well. Imagine that this happened.",
      "\"The trust in everything about our club, the system, the way we play, would be completely different.",
      "\"So, if you win, everything is okay. If you lose, you are doubting everything about yourself, about your team-mates, about the coach, everything. And that is normal.",
      "\"There is no back three against Brentford. Lately we play with Luke Shaw, two centre-backs and the right back. They play in different positions in the beginning.",
      "\"So it's not three centre-backs, it's the same thing with a little bit different positions. Against Brentford, second half, it was like a 4-4-2. The problem is that we were not good with the ball, we were soft without the ball and we lose.",
      "\"But imagine that we score the penalty. In the final goal we are trying to win the game, everyone is out of position. That can happen in the 4-3-3 or the 3-4-3. So I think the details matter more than the system.\"",
      "AMORIM: \"No. Guys, I'm the manager of the club, the big club. Is the media going to dictate what I'm going to do? It cannot be. It's not possible to sustain that.",
      "\"I talk with the players every day and I explain point by point what is happening with our team. So again, it's not a 3-4-3 all the time.",
      "\"I think we are thinking about the system but I think we need to look at all of the parts of the game. This team play in the different systems for many years, and you were talking about the lack of identity, no idea, whatever.",
      "\"So it's not the system. It's the small details, the way we play the game. And I understand what people think. 'What would this team be in a different system?' I don't know. Maybe this team would win more games.",
      "\"But if we don't change certain things, we are not going to win titles whether we change to 4-3-3 or 4-4-2.",
      "\"And that is my point with the players - not with you, I don't want to change your mind - but my players. I guarantee you they are listening to you. All those opinions, they are putting that inside because we are not winning games.",
      "\"And they have to believe in me because I watch more [Man Utd] games than you guys combined.\"",
      "Super 6 are starting the season by guaranteeing a £1,000,000 winner! Play for free."

      "Saturday 4 October 2025 15:17, UK",
      "Gary Neville has delivered his most damning verdict on Ruben Amorim's Manchester United yet as the under-pressure Portuguese coach readies for a crunch clash against Sunderland this weekend.",
      "Amorim fell to another sobering defeat as a rampant Brentford beat United 3-1 at the Gtech last weekend.",
      "It denied Amorim the chance to end a dismal record of failing to secure back-to-back league games in the same season since May 2024. United now sit in 14th, having lost three games this season, losing two and drawing one of their six fixtures, which has prompted huge concerns for Neville.",
      "\"I'm very worried,\" Neville told NBC, Sky's US partner, following the 3-1 defeat at Brentford. \"There's no point in me sitting here and saying that I'm not.",
      "\"The levels of performance, the results, the substitutions...[at Brentford], I saw something [which happened] at the end of the Grimsby game that they lost in the Carabao Cup a couple of weeks ago, which was Mason Mount ending up at left wing back.",
      "\"Now, look, we admire managers who are resilient, who are stubborn around the system. We want them to stick to the plan.",
      "\"But when you've got Mason Mount playing at left wing-back, you're going to look pretty stupid. And that's happened twice now. It can't happen. The first time I thought was unforgivable and it's happened again.",
      "\"He changes his back three and his back five every single game. And the performances and the results are just unacceptable. So I'm really, really worried.",
      "\"I would never go on television - I know how difficult a manager's job can be - and say that a manager should be sacked. But I suspect that the hierarchy at Manchester United are going to want to see a turnaround very quickly.\"",
      "Neville: \"When you've got Mason Mount playing at left wing-back, you're going to look pretty stupid.\"",
      "What the stats say: A manager's substitutions are meant to help a team, but Ruben Amorim's in-game changes at Manchester United have so far proven to be more of a hindrance. His Premier League substitutes have made more errors leading to goals than they have scored goals.",
      "That is as damning as stats come for a coach. The tally stands at 3-2 since he took charge nearly 11 months ago. In six games this season, two of Amorim's substitutes have made errors leading to a goal and none have scored off the bench.",
      "Neville: \"The results are just unacceptable.\"",
      "What the stats say: Results have been bad ever since Amorim arrived, so it is difficult to tell what it would take for the situation to become intolerable for the decision-makers at Old Trafford.",
      "Graham Potter was sacked by West Ham last weekend with a win percentage of 26.1 in the Premier League. Amorim's stands at 27.27 per cent after 33 games.",
      "For context, that is identical to Chris Wilder's record at Sheffield United in the top-flight after 66 games.",
      "Steve Bruce had a marginally better win rate when he was sacked by Newcastle, and so did Gary O'Neil at Wolves. This is the ballpark Amorim is in.",
      "Compared to coaches at 'Big Six' clubs since that moniker came into being in the early 2010s, Amorim has the worst Premier League record of those with at least 30 games. Juande Ramos was not much better at Spurs (28.6 per cent), but the 'Big Six' didn't exist then.",
      "Neville: \"He changes his back three and his back five every single game.\"",
      "What the stats say: Amorim has used 21 different back threes in his 33 Premier League games at United, which is by far and away the most of any other side in the competition during that timeframe. Southampton (13) and Wolves (10) are the closest behind.",
      "A change to the back three worked against Amorim last time out, with Harry Maguire starting in the back three for the first time in the league last season and playing a part in the first goal United conceded.",
      "Tinkering with his back line appears to be a consistent theme under Amorim. Leny Yoro, who started each of United's first four league games of the season, hasn't started since but has been introduced in the last two. Matthijs de Ligt and Luke Shaw have both started all of United's league games so far. However, Shaw has only completed 90 minutes in three of those games.",
      "The lack of consistency at the back of United has proved to be a reflection of their lack of consistency in both results and performances."
