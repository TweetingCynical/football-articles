      "Marcus Rashford in action for Barcelona(Image: )",
      "Marcus Rashford lifted his first trophy with Barcelona just hours after Manchester United were dumped out of the FA Cup by Brighton & Hove Albion. Former Leeds United forward Raphinha netted a decisive double as the Catalan giants secured a 3-2 victory over Real Madrid in Jeddah.",
      "Robert Lewandowski was also on target, with Rashford coming off the bench for the final eight minutes of normal time. And the England international missed a glorious chance to make it 4-2 to his side in the closing stages of the game.",
      "Taking to Instagram after the game, Rashford wrote: “SUPER CUP CHAMPIONS What a way to start the year!!” Rashford completed a season-long loan move to the Spanish giants during the summer transfer window.",
      "The deal includes an option for the La Liga leaders to sign him outright at the end of the season for around £26million. And speaking when he joined the club, he revealed: “This team has the foundations to achieve it.",
      "“Otherwise, they would not have won three trophies last season. The mentality and motivation are high; I don’t see any reason not to win all the trophies we play.”",
      "In an interview with Barca's YouTube channel back in October, Rashford revealed he’s loving life in Spain and is keen to remain at Barca beyond this season. He said: \"I'm really enjoying my time in Spain. The weather is the best part. It's a very big change.",
      "\"I'm learning every day, I'm really enjoying it. I hope to be here for a long time. I get along really well with Roony [Bardghji], as well as Jules [Kounde] and Frenkie [De Jong].",
      "\"It's a team where we all blend together. We're united. The team is fantastic. I just have to be in the right position. I'll keep trying to do this. We have to keep going like this to be our best. We have a lot more to do this season.\"",
      "He then continued: \"I'm enjoying this football club and I think for anybody who loves football, Barcelona is one of the key clubs in the history of the game, so to play here is an honour.",
      "Marcus Rashford in action for Barcelona against Real Madrid(Image: Getty)",
      "\"I just believe that things happen when they're supposed to happen. It's not the first time I spoke with Barcelona about potentially coming here, but for whatever reasons it didn't happen in the past, and now is my opportunity to make it happen.",
      "\"I feel like there's no time like the present now. People forget this, but 23 years of my life was with Manchester United. So sometimes you just need a change.",
      "\"I think maybe this is the case with me and yeah, I'm enjoying everything. I don't feel there is much change in me, I just feel it's a new environment and culture and one I looked forward to coming here.",
      "\"It's just about me adapting and fitting in as well as possible. I'm so hungry to keep improving.\"",

      "Kai Rooney plays for Manchester United's academy (Image: Getty)",
      "Wayne Rooney has been forbidden by his son Kai from attending his youth games for Manchester United. Kai, 16, is following in his famous father's footsteps by playing for the Red Devils, having joined the team when he was just 11.",
      "As the eldest of four boys born to Wayne and his wife Coleen, there's immense pressure on the young forward to emulate his dad's success at Old Trafford. That is no small task considering Wayne is United's top scorer of all time with 253 goals, a former captain and a five-time Premier League champion after a 13-year career in the first team, having become a household name at the same age as Kai is now.",
      "Unsurprisingly, even before proving himself as a promising talent in United's youth ranks, Kai attracted widespread media and fan attention. While this spotlight has boosted his profile and helped him secure a boot deal with Puma at the mere age of 12, it has also had its downsides.",
      "One such drawback is that Wayne sadly can't watch his son's football matches live without being swarmed by fans asking for photos and autographs. With the media frenzy following Wayne off the pitch and overshadowing Kai's progress on it, Coleen once revealed that Kai made the heart-wrenching decision to ask the England legend not to attend his games.",
      "Coleen explained on I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out of Here in 2024: \"That's the thing with kids I think, it's hard to go on days out. Kai told Wayne to stop coming to football games, when he played grassroots tournaments and stuff because he used to get swarmed and he couldn't even watch the game.",
      "\"How do you say to all of these kids, 'Go away, I'm watching my son?' Adults, it's different, you could speak to them. So he (Kai) just said, 'Oh, dad there's no point you coming because you don't even watch me play anyway.' Which is sad, but it can't be helped anyway. At the same time, the fans help you along the way and get you where you are.\"",
      "Kai began featuring for United's U18s this season aged just 15, several months before his birthday in November. He made his debut coming off the bench during their 1-0 victory over his dad's boyhood club, Everton, at Finch Farm back in August.",
      "Wayne Rooney is a Red Devils hero(Image: Getty)",
      "Unfortunately, injury ruled him out during the opening weeks of the campaign, although he has now made his return to action for Darren Fletcher's team, celebrating his comeback with a goal.",
      "Wayne, aware of his own standing in football, previously admitted he tries to let the club’s coaching staff handle the bulk of his son’s development by not giving him too many tactical instructions. However, he does occasionally share valuable wisdom with all of his sons at home, with Klay and Cass representing United and Everton, respectively.",
      "Wayne's presence at Kai's matches caused too much chaos(Image: Getty)",
      "The 40-year-old said on The Wayne Rooney Show: \"I'm quite lucky where I live as I've got a little pitch there and when the kids say, 'We're coming on the pitch', all they're gonna do is tie the balls on the top corner.",
      "\"So when I say to them when I was younger, I remember setting a little square to practise passing into it and just playing off the wall. So I'm very similar, [I tell them], 'You need to work on your speed, you need to work on your technique and control.' Otherwise, you go out and you're just like, 'Watch me hit the ball in the top corner.'\"",

      "Scott McTominay was hailed as a “soldier on a mission” and compared to Jude Bellingham after his latest heroics in Serie A. Coach Antonio Conte was sent off for protesting a penalty decision and shouting at the fourth official in the 2-2 draw with Inter Milan.",
      "But McTominay was Man of the Match for netting two equalisers after getting caught in possession for Inter’s opening goal. The Scot was sold by Manchester United for £25m in 2024 and he won Serie A last season and the Player of the Year.",
      "And the Italian media heaped more praise on him after his latest stunning display which keeps Napoli in third place in Serie A just four points behind leaders Inter Milan.",
      "Corriere della Sera claimed McTominay played “like a robot” by the way he reacted after his early mistake. And former West Ham star Paolo di Canio told Sky Sport Italia: “He embodies Conte’s essence and mentality. He made a mistake for the first goal but that’s no problem",
      "“I compared McTominay to when Bellingham was moved back with the arrival of Mbappe. He is a soldier on a mission. He has gradually settled into another position and is dominant. When Rasmus Hojlund attacks the space, he prevents the defenders from marking McTominay. They are obsessively coached.”",
      "McTominay told DAZN Italia: “Of course mistakes are part of football, you can’t go down, you have to stand up and try to do your best. Everyone makes mistakes in football, so I just want to give my best and help the team as much as possible. I always thought we were in the game.”",
      "Napoli won the Italian Super Cup just before Christmas and remain in contention for the scudetto, Italian Cup and the Champions League despite a long injury list.",
      "“The players are giving everything,” McTominay added. No Anguissa, no Lukaku, no Gilmour, no De Bruyne, no Rrahmani at the start of the season, Neres injured, I mean it’s as if Inter Milan had no Lautaro Martinez, no Thuram, no Barella, no Calhanoglu.",
      "Scott McTominay hailed the spirit of his Napoli team-mates after the 2-2 draw at Inter Milan(Image: )",
      "“It’s difficult when we are pushing every single game like this, it’s an absolute credit to the players, because the manager and the staff have put everything in place for us to succeed and do well, fair play to the boys, because we’ve got no ‘give up’ here.”",
      "Napoli assistant Cristian Stellini took Napoli’s post-match press conference and claimed Conte’s dismissal was “a moment of frustration”. But Inter Milan coach Cristian Chivu",
      "said: “I can only admire him and learn from him. Napoli deserve credit for never giving up and continuing to fight to the end to draw and even try to win. these are two great teams who raised the level of what modern football and Serie A can be.”",

      "Macclesfield hero Sam Heathcote has been denied his dream of playing against boyhood club Manchester United after their Crystal Palace giant-killing. The Silkmen downed the reigning FA Cup holders in the biggest shock that the competition has ever witnessed following their 2-1 win on Saturday.",
      "The National League North club, guided by John Rooney – younger brother of Manchester United and England icon Wayne – have their eyes set on their next dream tie, with the draw set to take place at Anfield on Monday evening. Joyous scenes have dominated the landscape with shots of captain and bandaged Paul Dawson heading home after the opener or the pitch invasion that followed after the full-time whistle.",
      "The celebrations went on long into the night with those associated with the Cheshire club, and Heathcote, who featured at the heart of the Macclesfield defence against Oliver Glasner's side, had his sights set on a date with the Red Devils, but their 2-1 defeat to Brighton & Hove Albion on Sunday robbed the primary school teacher of that dream.",
      "The Heathcote family have an affinity to Anfield after the 28-year-old defender's dad, Graham, netted at the Kop end for Altrincham in a 4-1 defeat for the Robins, with January 3 being the 45th anniversary since the goal. Should Arne Slot's side navigate their way around a third-round upset against Barnsley, the defender could be in line to follow his father's footsteps.",
      "\"So he scored Anfield, he said the only thing that could have potentially pipped it was if I played against United.",
      "\"So that's who I wanted in the next round. I'd love to score at Anfield, don't get me wrong.\"",
      "Macclesfield boast a top-of-the-table budget in the National League North, but it is a percentage of the price tags being touted for Palace stars Adam Wharton and Marc Guehi. It was an afternoon to forget for the defeated holders, and an inquest was held immediately after the match, with pictures showing the 25-year-old, Guehi, speaking to fans behind the goal, while at the other end, Dawson and Luke Duffy were held aloft in the pitch invasion.",
      "Full-back Lewis Fensome was almost immediately brought back down to reality as he was filmed by teammate Josh Kay, on loan from Oldham Athletic, hooving up at his gym in the north west and the majority of the Macclesfield players returned to normality on Monday for their day jobs.",
      "Sam Heathcote poses with a beer after Macclesfield's giant-killing.(Image: Getty Images)",
      "Even over 24 hours after the famous feat, it hadn't sunk in. Heathcote said: \"It's weird, that's probably the main thing. No one would have guessed what would have happened in that 90 minutes and beyond that, so yeah, I just still feel really strange and I'm obviously still full of adrenaline.",
      "\"I think it has sunk in, but I also still can't quite believe that it's happened it's like it's just been a big dream over the weekend.\"",
      "The media duties and the occasion took over for the defender, and he didn't manage to grab a memento from his Premier League counterparts.",
      "Rooney's side set the tone with their hard-hitting, front-footed approach as well as their resilience but despite playing against a Palace side boasting £35million January signing Brennan Johnson, Heathcote says the occasion didn't faze or overawe them in a warning to clubs they could face in the fourth round.",
      "Luke Duffy (L) and Paul Dawson (middle) celebrate.(Image: Getty Images)",

      "\"About a minute later I was like, 'mate, you've just nailed an England player that's class that'. But at the end of the day, everyone's just regular people, aren't they?",
      "\"They're normal men, just like we are. It was 11 v 11 yesterday, and that's the way you've got to look at it. You can't be starstruck or anything like that, you can always have a go, can't you? That's exactly what we did.\"",

      "Manchester United have little time to dwell on their FA Cup third round exit following a 2-1 home defeat to Premier League rivals Brighton & Hove Albion on Sunday afternoon, which has seen them bow out of the competition.",
      "The match may have been Darren Fletcher's last as caretaker manager, with the club nearing a decision on Ruben Amorim's successor. United are set to appoint an interim manager until the season's end, with former midfielder Michael Carrick emerging as the frontrunner for the role.",
      "Should his appointment be confirmed, Carrick's first test will be the Manchester Derby against Manchester City at Old Trafford. The game will kick off at 12.30pm on Saturday.",
      "In the lead-up to the clash, United have received a double boost regarding player availability. Three of their stars - Bryan Mbeumo, Noussair Mazraoui and Amad - were involved in Africa Cup of Nations quarter-final action this week, with Mbeumo's Cameroon facing Mazraoui's Morocco and Amad's Ivory Coast taking on Nigeria.",
      "Defeats for both Cameroon and the Ivory Coast mean that two of the three players - Mbeumo and Amad, will return to Carrington in time for the weekend's game against City, making them likely contenders for selection.",
      "Mazraoui, however, won't be available due to Morocco's progression to the semi-finals of the tournament. Their final four match against Nigeria is set for Wednesday night, with an 8pm kick-off.",
      "Noussair Mazraoui won't be available for Manchester United against Man City after his Morocco team beat Cameroon in the Afcon quarter-final. (Image: DeFodi Images, DeFodi Images via Getty Images)",
      "If they triumph, they'll face either Senegal or Egypt in the tournament final on Sunday. However, even if they fall short, Morocco will still compete in the third-place play-off on Saturday.",
      "United are doing well on the injury front, with centre-back Matthijs de Ligt being the only current concern. The defender has been sidelined for the past nine matches due to a back injury, making his participation in the upcoming match uncertain.",
      "Following his dismissal against Brighton on Sunday, young winger Shea Lacey will serve his one-match ban during the weekend clash with City. The 18-year-old was given his marching orders after receiving a second yellow card with just one minute of normal time remaining.",

      "Manchester United loanee Marcus Rashford lifted the Spanish Super Cup with Barcelona on Sunday(Image: Getty)",
      "Manchester United loanee Marcus Rashford celebrated his first trophy win as a Barcelona player on Sunday evening. However, the English forward's limited 15-minute appearance in the final and the rise of a team-mate suggest his playing time could take a knock.",
      "Rashford's Barcelona took on arch-rivals Real Madrid in the Super Cup final in Jeddah, with star player Raphinha breaking the deadlock in the 36th minute. Real's Vinicius Junior equalised but Robert Lewandowski quickly restored Barcelona's lead before half-time. The thrilling end to the first half saw Gonzalo Garcia bring things level for Los Blancos, with the third added-time goal.",
      "However, it was ex-Leeds United winger Raphinha who clinched the victory for the Catalan side, netting his second and Barcelona's third in the 73rd minute. Rashford came on to replace the Man of the Match in the 83rd minute but missed a golden opportunity in stoppage time after Frenkie de Jong was sent off.",
      "Spanish media were quick to criticise Rashford for his miss but it was Raphinha who undoubtedly stole the limelight, just as he did in their 5-0 semi-final triumph. This could spell trouble for Rashford, who is vying for playing time with the 29-year-old under manager Hansi Flick. The Spanish press couldn't praise the Brazilian enough.",
      "Rashford was restricted to roughly 15 minutes in the final, with his usual left-wing position taken by Raphinha from kick-off. When he entered the pitch, he found himself one-on-one in the fifth minute of stoppage time but squandered the opportunity.",
      "Marca's post-match assessment of Rashford was blunt: \"He came on in the 83rd minute. He had a clear chance in stoppage time but sent the ball wide.\"",
      "Rashford was blasted for his late miss(Image: AP)",
      "The Spanish publication was far more generous in their praise of the game's MVP Raphinha, portraying him as the driving force behind Rashford's side, suggesting the Englishman's time on the left could be diminishing. They continued: \"Raphinha's brace, yet another one, turned the Clásico on its head, securing the Super Cup.",
      "\"It happened last season. Raphinha, who's on his way to becoming Real Madrid's nemesis, is the true leader of Hansi Flick's Barcelona. His impact on this team has been analysed since his absence when he was injured at the end of September. Barça played nine matches without him, winning only five.\"",
      "The squandered chance also dominated Mundo Deportivo's assessment of Rashford, with their critique being more damning. They stated: \"He missed a golden opportunity in stoppage time after a crucial defensive play. Then he lost focus on the subsequent defensive support, and Madrid almost equalised.\"",
      "But once more, Raphinha, who Rashford deputised for earlier this campaign during a thigh problem, received special recognition from Mundo Deportivo.",
      "The publication went as far as suggesting he might currently be the planet's finest player. They wrote: \"Raphinha is undoubtedly the player in the best form in the world right now. He's absolutely decisive, his competitive spirit is contagious and he makes all the difference.\"",
      "The Brazilian scored two goals in the 3-2 win(Image: AP)",
      "Once more, AS highlighted Rashford's stoppage-time squandered opportunity, as this appeared to be his sole notable moment during the brief spell Flick afforded him. They wrote: \"He had the chance to kill the game, with a one-on-one with Courtois, inexplicably sending the ball wide.\"",
      "They also opted to praise Raphinha for dragging his team across the finish line and noted that, despite spurning a similar opportunity to Rashford's, he immediately made up for it in the subsequent attack.",
      "\"A true superstar,\" they declared. \"This Super Cup is practically Raphinha's after scoring four goals and providing an assist in two matches. In the final, after missing a clear-cut chance from Lamine, he quickly redeemed himself by scoring a fantastic goal in the very next play.\"",
      "Raphinha celebrated with his team-mates(Image: Getty)",
      "Sport adopted a more generous view of Rashford's brief appearance, opting instead to praise his late runs which allowed Barcelona some respite as their opponents searched for a leveller. They noted: \"He helped the team gain some breathing room with his runs.\"",
      "However, nearly all major Spanish media outlets agreed that Raphinha was the star of the show. They hailed him as one of the world's best and even suggested his performance was worthy of a Ballon d'Or.",
      "The Englishman was introduced late in the final(Image: Getty)",
      "Raphinha seems to be establishing himself as an indispensable asset at Barcelona, which could spell bad news for Rashford's playing time on the left wing. For instance, in their match against Athletic Club, Rashford was brought on as early as the 65th minute.",
      "Sport wrote about Raphinha's performance: \"When the match seemed destined for penalties, he made it 3-2 for the Blaugrana, putting their biggest rivals on the ropes,\" adding, \"A bit of luck, too. A fantastic performance, whether some like it or not, worthy of a Ballon d'Or.\"",

      "Scott McTominay's scintillating second season at Napoli is showing no signs of slowing down after his eye-catching display against Inter Milan on Sunday. The midfielder, who left Manchester United in the summer of 2024, completed the full 90 minutes of Napoli's clash with Serie A title rivals Inter, where Antonio Conte's side secured an important 2-2 draw to remain within four points of the table-toppers.",
      "McTominay's contribution proved vital in earning a point at the San Siro, netting both of Napoli's goals to bring his season total to eight. The Serie A 2024/2025 MVP award recipient was heavily involved from kick-off, although not initially in the manner he'd hoped.",
      "The Scotland international surrendered possession to Piotr Zielinski in his own half while receiving the ball with his back to goal, which was immediately capitalised upon as Federico Dimarco put Inter ahead from the counter in the ninth minute.",
      "McTominay was dispossessed too easily for Conte's taste, with the manager later shown a red card for dissent after Inter were handed a questionable penalty.",
      "But the 29-year-old responded brilliantly, drawing level in the 26th minute with a near-post first-time finish following a trademark lung-busting run into the area.",
      "After Inter's second-half penalty, McTominay once again demonstrated his exceptional goal-scoring prowess in the 81st minute by equalising for a second time, volleying home his attempt from close range, which earned him the nickname \"ruthless robot\".",
      "His ability to seize the game and not shy away after a mistake drew huge praise from the Italian press. Eurosport Italy summed it up by going with \"McTominay with guts/bottle\" as their headline.",
      "McTominay gave the ball away for Inter's opener(Image: AFP via Getty Images)",
      "They noted how such a costly mistake “would have flattened anyone… but not him,” before praising his “big attributes in midfield” and labelling him “MVP”. The outlet gave him a match rating of 8/10.",
      "Corriere della Sera also handed out an 8/10 rating, emphasising his impressive mentality to bounce back by saying: \"Like a robot he programmes himself and becomes the protagonist with technique and cold-bloodedness.\"",
      "McTominay showed courage to bounce back with two goals(Image: AP)",
      "Football Italia mirrored this view by naming him man of the match and branding him \"Priceless McTominay\" in their headline, while awarding a match rating of 8.5/10.",
      "Corriere dello Sport backed that up by stating he \"bossed it\" at the San Siro, describing him as Napoli's leader, performing with \"great substance\" and dragging his team-mates forward.",
      "He was described as 'priceless' and a 'leader' in big games(Image: AP)",
      "La Repubblica also called him a “leader”, while Sky Sport Italy gave him an 8/10 rating too. Il Giornale described McTominay’s performance as “ruthless”.",
      "They mentioned how despite committing a mistake you wouldn't expect from a player of his calibre, he was forgiven on the night for two “poacher’s goals” worth a massive point.",

      "The Portuguese head coach was sacked this time last week after 14 months in charge. One of the hallmarks of his tenure was his 3-4-3 philosophy which he refused to veer from, even if it didn't bring about the desired results.",
      "Amorim was a devout defender of his system, often suggesting that was not the reason for his team's poor form. He persevered with three at the back at the wing-backs, meaning United's players have had that drilled into them for more than a year now.",
      "That has not been a traditional gameplan for the club and Fletcher concedes the next man through the door, tipped to be either Ole Gunnar Solskjaer or Michael Carrick, will have to spend time undoing the lessons learnt under Amorim.",
      "The caretaker said on the challenges ahead\": “Confidence and potentially being used to playing a certain style and formation - that’s difficult to adapt from. But as I said, they’ve just got to come together. The biggest thing for me is that the group, the players, whoever leads them comes together.",
      "\"It’s only them in the situation, it’s only them that can do something about it, build the confidence through grinding out maybe some results. You want to play nice football but you’ve got to find a way to win first and, once you do that, hard work, attitude, application. It might not be pretty at times but from there you can grow and build and then fast, exciting football can come.”",

The Scot said: \"They are experienced players, they are talented players and, as I said, I challenge them to regroup and it’s over to them. Someone is going to come in and lead them and they need to make sure that they’ve got a lot to play for this season. This team’s still good enough to achieve success this season but they’ve got to dig deep and find a way within themselves.”",

      "The former Red Devils midfielder was an assistant coach at Old Trafford between July 2018 and December 2021. Before choosing to leave shortly after Solskjaer's sacking, Carrick took charge of United for three games.",
      "Those were a 2-0 win away to Villarreal in the Champions League, a 1-1 draw at Chelsea in the Premier League and a 3-2 victory at home to Arsenal. Carrick then stepped aside, allowing Ralf Rangnick to take the reins.",
      "Ronaldo scored three times during that period and paid tribute to his ex-team-mate upon his departure. \"Michael Carrick was a class act as a player and he can become a great coach as well,\" the former United striker wrote on social media.",

      "Now Carrick is set to have the chance to prove Ronaldo right. To do so, the 34-time England international would have prove his doubters wrong.",
      "In November 2022, Carrick was appointed Middlesbrough manager. The 44-year-old achieved an impressive play-off finish in his first season but after failing to win promotion over the next two campaigns, he was sacked by Boro last June.",
      "Carrick had two years left on his contract at Middlesbrough but their 10th-place finish wasn't enough to satisfy the board. He'd been joined by his brother, Graeme, and former Boro star Jonathan Woodgate in the dugout.",
      "Should United decide to give Carrick the job on an interim basis, his first game would be the small matter of a Manchester derby, as the Red Devils host bitter rivals City on Saturday. The following weekend, it's a trip to league leaders Arsenal.",

      "Ruben Amorim may have to watch on as Manchester United move for players he recommended(Image: Nick Potts/PA Wire)",
      "Just because Ruben Amorim's time as Manchester United manager is over, it doesn't have to mean his work goes to waste. And given the January transfer window is currently open for business, some of his input could be put to good use right now.",
      "The Portuguese tactician was disappointed in his efforts to improve United's squad in places. Part of that was due to a breakdown between Amorim and certain board members, namely director of football Jason Wilcox and director of recruitment Christopher Vivell.",
      "Following Amorim's dismissal, The Sun reported of seven targets he wanted but were ultimately vetoed by Wilcox and Vivell, who favoured a more data-driven approach. However, there are a few names on the wishlist who could still make sense for the club should they wish to explore them.",
      "Two names Amorim allegedly wanted were the Aston Villa duo of Ollie Watkins and Emiliano Martinez, who have each proved themselves as Premier League stars already. However, there's little logic in pursuing either player now.",
      "Instead of chasing Watkins, United wrapped up a £74million move for the younger Benjamin Sesko, who came with more resale value. And although he hasn't been as prolific as hoped, his recent brace in the 2-2 draw against Burnley was evidence things could be on the up for the Slovenian.",
      "Meanwhile, things are going a lot more smoothly for Senne Lammens, the latest goalkeeper to take on the burden of United's No. 1 mantle. And the former Royal Antwerp stopper has been among United's rare transfer wins of late, showcasing superb shot-stopping ability - and he's had ample opportunity to do so.",
      "Amorim unsurprisingly wanted to recruit from former employers Sporting CP to bolster numerous areas of his United team. It's reported that shortlist included interest in winger Geovany Quenda, midfielder Morten Hjulmand, as well as centre-back Ousmane Diomande and versatile wide man Salvador Blopa.",
      "Any move for Quenda is now off the table given he's already sealed a £42m move to Chelsea ahead of this summer. However, the other three names currently based in Lisbon could each serve a purpose in Manchester.",
      "Denmark's Morten Hjulmand was ruled Sporting CP's midfield during one of their most successful eras(Image: Diogo Cardoso/Getty Images)",
      "Namely defensive midfielder Hjulmand, who at 26 fits the age profile of someone who could make an instant impact. The signs suggest Brazil veteran Casemiro will leave Old Trafford and free up significant space on the wage bill this summer, while Manuel Ugarte has struggled to kick on despite his £42m move from PSG.",
      "United have come to rely quite heavily on Casemiro's talents at the base of midfield despite some past wobbles. A Bola has reported Hjulmand has a £69m release clause in his contract that will become valid for a brief period in the summer, though Sporting may be willing to let him leave for as little as £43m due to good conduct.",
      "A player like Diomande isn't quite as high a priority given United already have a couple of promising, young defenders in the first team. However, concerns around the fitness of players like Luke Shaw, Lisandro Martinez and Harry Maguire could change that.",
      "Maguire could leave a considerable void in the summer when his contract expires. Shaw's deal is set to run out at the end of the 2026/27 campaign, meanwhile, meaning it may not be long before reinforcements in central defence become a top priority.",
      "PSG's Nuno Mendes is a highly valued asset in the French capital(Image: AFP via Getty Images)",
      "Blopa, 18, would have been an ideal recruit for Amorim's former 3-4-3 system, equally comfortable in a wing-back role as he is in wide midfield. That versatility could still come in handy at United, though he'll be all the harder to get having only recently signed a new deal with Sporting until 2030, complete with release clause that reportedly sits at around £68m.",
      "Last but not least, Amorim wanted to complete what would have been, and still will be, a very costly move for PSG left-back Nuno Mendes. And while Patrick Dorgu has since come to occupy the left wing-back role at Old Trafford, that move too could yet make sense.",
      "Dorgu has shown flashes of brilliance cutting in from a right wing role and could be deployed there more permanently in future. Not to mention Mendes is one of Europe's leading talents in his position, who would be a statement for United in re-establishing their status as still being among the global elite.",

      "But it is Carrick who looks set to win the race and he could be appointed within the next 48 hours, with United keen to give the new man time to prepare for the derby against Manchester City at Old Trafford on Saturday lunchtime. Chief executive Omar Berrada and director of football Jason Wilcox are set for more talks on Monday as they aim to finalise an appointment.",
      "Amorim was sacked a week ago and Berrada and Wilcox quickly resolved to appoint an interim head coach until the end of the season, while putting Fletcher in charge for games against Burnley and Brighton.",
      "Carrick met Berrada and Wilcox last Thursday and Solskjaer held talks with the duo on Saturday. The Norwegian, who managed United for three years between November 2018 and November 2021, quickly emerged as the favourite and has been back in the north west since being sacked by Besiktas in August. That seven-month spell in Turkey is his only job since leaving Old Trafford.",
      "It was Carrick who stepped in when Solskjaer was dismissed, leading United for three games before stepping down from a coaching role when Ralf Rangnick was appointed until the end of the season. The 44-year-old former United man oversaw a Champions League win in Villarreal and an Old Trafford success against Arsenal, along with a draw with Chelsea.",

      "Fletcher has carried himself well during his spell in charge of the first team, but a draw with Burnley and a defeat to Brighton will have hurt his chances of landing the job until the end of the season. He revealed after the FA Cup defeat to Brighton that he had been told to report to Carrington on Monday morning.",

      "Carrick is the leading contender for the interim job.(Image: 2021 Manchester United FC)",
      "Four years after stepping down as Manchester United caretaker and declining the chance to coach alongside Ralf Rangnick, Michael Carrick is preparing for another crack at the job.",
      "Carrick has emerged as the frontrunner for the interim position for the remainder of the season after impressing during his interview. Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has also been in contention for the role and United are expected to formally announce who will assume the position in the next 48 hours.",
      "\"It's Carrick, you know, it's hard to believe it's not Scholes,\" was aired at Turf Moor last week. United fans are disillusioned with Ineos' decision-making, and they are set to protest against the Glazers and Sir Jim Ratcliffe before facing Fulham, but Carrick is guaranteed to receive strong support from matchgoers.",
      "The former midfielder is hugely popular and only enhanced his reputation during his caretaker stint, in which he oversaw wins against Villarreal and Arsenal, and a draw against Chelsea. Rangnick was appointed as interim to oversee the second half of 2021/22, and Carrick declined the opportunity to continue as part of his coaching staff, partly out of loyalty to Solskjaer.",
      "“It is 100% my decision,” Carrick said at the time. “I respect a new manager coming in. I made the decision before speaking to him. It wasn’t an easy one but [it is the] right decision for the club. The loyalty to Ole is a little bit of a factor, but there were a lot of things that came into my decision.",
      "“I was conscious of making my decision before any real conversations with Ralf. It was nothing personal at all. He’s got a good group of players to work with. I’m proud of the players over the past three games. I just told them and they were a bit shocked and surprised, a bit emotional in the changing room.”",
      "Carrick was asked what he would do next. “I can honestly say I’ve given it no thought. Take the kids to school then we’ll see,” he said. “My time at this great club will always rank as the best years of my career.”",
      "Carrick has unfinished business at United.(Image: 2021 Manchester United FC)",
      "In management, what Carrick did next was take the Middlesbrough job in his native north east. He guided Boro to the play-offs in 2022/23, but was sacked in June 2025 after eighth and tenth place finishes.",
      "Carrick worked with limited resources at Middlesbrough, who have played just one season in the Premier League since their relegation in 2009, and it felt like his tenure had run its course.",
      "There is a feeling that Carrick has unfinished business at Old Trafford. And he should give himself a pat on the back for declining to work with Rangnick in 2021, as he wouldn't have been considered for the job in 2026 if he'd been part of the German's disastrous coaching staff that season.",
      "Carrick decided to walk away from a campaign that was about to unravel with Rangnick in charge. The irony is that he could walk into Carrington with this season threatening to unfold in the same manner.",
      "The 41-year-old's first game if he lands the job will be against Manchester City, followed by a trip to Arsenal. It doesn't get much trickier than playing the Premier League's pacesetters.",
      "United could slip into the bottom half of the table if results don't go their way. They have already exited the Carabao Cup and FA Cup, and the campaign would become bleak if hopes of securing Champions League football are dashed before mid-February. Carrick will be desperate to make a quick impact.",
      "Carrick dropped Ronaldo at Stamford Bridge.(Image: 2021 Getty Images)",
      "He is a winner and was popular among players during his coaching stint, which should help him. Bruno Fernandes was a close ally and will act as a sounding board if Carrick is formally announced.",
      "The Newcastle-born boss has demonstrated his ability to make big decisions, which is another plus. Carrick had the courage to drop Cristiano Ronaldo at Stamford Bridge in December 2021 and intelligently disarmed the media when he played down the significance of the decision after that game.",
      "\"I didn't see it as being a major decision,\" he said. \"It certainly wasn't within the camp or group. We all got on really well. The game went well to an extent and it wasn't a drama at all.\"",
      "It's those kinds of decisions that a United manager must make with conviction to be successful. Carrick is not afraid to axe players from the team and he should be able to give the current crop a kick up the backside.",
      "United looked like they needed a jolt against Brighton last weekend. Darren Fletcher described the group as \"fragile\", and a club source recently questioned the mentality of those in the dressing room.",
      "Carrick was part of various United dressing rooms over the years with no concerns about mentality. He will need every bit of his coaching experience to secure a spot in the Champions League this season.",

      "Manchester United will look into how Bruno Fernandes was hacked on X, formerly Twitter. Fernandes' account was hijacked for over an hour following the FA Cup defeat to Brighton on Sunday evening.",
      "United's official account on X issued a statement to warn: \"Bruno Fernandes’s X account has been hacked. Supporters should not engage with any of the posts or direct messages.\"",

      "Fernandes has 4.5million followers on X. The United captain last posted on the platform in October when he made his 300th appearance for the club in a win against Brighton.",
      "The hacker gained access to the account just hours after United crashed out of the FA Cup at the first opportunity, meaning there will be no silverware at Old Trafford this season.",
      "United were knocked out of the Carabao Cup second round by Grimsby Town in August. United will play 40 games this season, which will be their fewest in a campaign for 111 years.",
      "Fernandes chose to stay in Manchester in the summer transfer window, turning down interest from Saudi Arabia. Al-Hilal submitted a lucrative proposal for the midfielder, but he decided to continue at United.",

      "Dalot reacted after the FA Cup defeat.(Image: MUTV)",
      "Diogo Dalot believes Manchester United must improve their defensive record. United crashed out of the FA Cup on Sunday evening after losing 2-1 against Brighton at Old Trafford. The defeat means United will play 40 games this season, their fewest in a campaign for 111 years.",
      "Michael Carrick is the leading candidate to take interim charge of the team for the remainder of the season, and the former midfielder will try to steer the club into the Champions League places. United have conceded 36 goals in all competitions this season. The Reds have recorded just two clean sheets in the Premier League, and Dalot believes the defensive record is a clear area for improvement.",
      "Speaking after the Brighton defeat, he told MUTV: \"Really difficult to take. The last couple of games, you try to find ways to win the game, and I think we did enough to win, but in the end, it's really frustrating because in the second half, we gave them so few chances to score goals, and we created enough to win, and we controlled the game.\"",
      "When it was put to Dalot that United continue to concede goals despite conceding few shots on target, he said: \"I think that's something we have to look at. We are in the phase where every attack they have is a threat to us, we are conceding so few shots on target.",
      "\"But we concede one goal at least every game. I still believe we're going to score every game. We are a threat, but when it's time to defend, we need more urgency as a team.\"",
      "Carrick is expected to land the interim job, which means his first game in charge will be against Manchester City this weekend. City are winless in their last three league games but are still in second position.",
      "\"Not just the leaders, but the whole group,\" said Dalot about how United must respond. \"You have to find ways to overcome this, to find energy between each other to come to training, be professional and prepare for a big game.\"",
      "United will be boosted by the return of Amad and Bryan Mbeumo for the Manchester derby. The pair will be available for the first time since reporting to the Africa Cup of Nations with their respective nations.",

I think about the job that I've got in hand. I really do, and so it wasn't something that was on my radar at all, but when I do get asked to do it, I know that I can do it.",
      "\"I know that I'm comfortable doing it. I know the environment, I believe in myself. I feel like I've learned a lot in the five years that I've been here. I've had great experiences as a player.

      "Manchester United's players have been challenged to show their true colours for the rest of the season(Image: )",
      "Darren Fletcher has told Manchester United's players they need to prove they have a future at Old Trafford after challenging them to make sure they don't waste this season. Fletcher's spell in charge of the side is likely to come to an end after a 2-1 defeat to Brighton in the FA Cup third round at Old Trafford.",
      "That game ended United's hopes of winning silverware this season and they have exited both cup competitions at the first hurdle for the first time since 1981/82. They will play just 40 games this season, the lowest tally since 1914/15, and the interim head coach will only have 17 Premier League games in four-and-a-half months to make an impact.",
      "Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and Michael Carrick are battling it out for that role and they will take over with United seventh in the Premier League. They face Manchester City and Arsenal in the next two games, but Fletcher is convinced Champions League qualification is a realistic aim.",
      "The Scot was part of the backroom staff in 2021/22, when the season fell apart under Ralf Rangnick after United were knocked out of the Champions League in mid-March, and although that was a difficult campaign, Fletcher felt it revealed plenty about the players, something that could be repeated this season.",
      "\"That was a very strange season,\" he said. \"There were a lot of players out of the contract and there was a lot of different dynamics and it was difficult when we went out in the Champions League. There was a massive drop-off, you could see that, and it was visible for everyone to see. But that also let us know the true characters of the players. True character reveals itself in difficult times, so we learned a lot about a lot of the players in that situation.",
      "\"That will be the same about these lads now. In difficult times, true character is going to show. They have to dig in, show they want to be part of Manchester United's future, learn from this. And ultimately, if you're not, then I don't think you should be here or will be here. Sounds strong, but that's just the reality and the way it should be.\"",
      "Although United are again on the brink of wasting another season, having sacked Ruben Amorim on Monday without a plan to appoint a successor, Fletcher is convinced that there is still a target worth chasing.",
      "United are only a point off fifth and three off Liverpool in fourth, and securing a return to the Champions League would be a major bonus. That will be the aim for whoever takes charge this week, but Fletcher said it is about the players as much as the new manager.",
      "\"I think these players have got the ability to qualify in the Champions League place, and that should be their objective, that should be their mindset,\" he said.",
      "\"But they're going to have to come together and be part of that as well. It's not about a manager, it's not about directors, it's about everyone. The players have to group together, take responsibility, find a way of improving quickly and take on the challenge for the rest of the season. Don't waste the season.\"",
      "Wasting the season would have been anathema to Fletcher and his teammates in the days when Sir Alex Ferguson was in charge, but he admits the club is a long way removed from that now.",
      "\"They understand it. They understand the club. They understand the expectations,\" said Fletcher. \"I keep saying I was lucky to play with the players I did, and then it became a cycle.",
      "\"We weren't aware of that when we were young. We thought we knew and we didn't and the older players and the experienced players and the ones who had been there before and did it, they educated us. They moulded us. Sir Alex moulded us and that was a cycle that was created but that takes time to create.",
      "\"But there's experienced players in that dressing room who need to come together, who need to carry the team, who need to challenge the team, who need to make the new players or the ones that maybe don't understand it, they're going to have to challenge them and pull them along with them, we're going to have to drag them and I hope that they do.\"",

      "United were knocked out of the FA Cup on Sunday.(Image: 2026 Getty Images)",
      "Manchester United suffered a 2-1 defeat to Brighton in the FA Cup third round at Old Trafford on Sunday. United's only realistic chance of silverware this season was the FA Cup, so there will be no trophy at Old Trafford this term.",
      "Brighton took the lead through Brajan Gruda after sloppy defending from United in the first half. Danny Welbeck then scored in the 64th minute to extend Brighton's advantage.",
      "United gave themselves a chance of forcing extra time when Benjamin Sesko scored with five minutes remaining, but Shea Lacey's late sending off dashed hopes of a late equaliser.",
      "Here are the moments you might have missed:",
      "Frustration boiled over",
      "Brighton have consistently been one of the best-coached teams in the Premier League over the last few years, despite changing managers, and they made it difficult for United to build up from the back.",
      "Fletcher looked frustrated on the touchline and emotions gradually began to boil over on the pitch, with Fernandes screaming in frustration after overhitting a through-ball to Benjamin Sesko.",
      "Fernandes played the pass with too much power, which made it impossible for Sesko to latch onto. A few minutes later, it was Kobbie Mainoo's turn to throw his hands in the air. The youngster made an intelligent pass to find Sesko, but the Slovenia international was offside - and at fault on that occasion.",
      "The body language from those in red shirts was not good, and it got even worse when Brighton extended their advantage. Fernandes lashed out again while Leny Yoro slumped to his knees in his own box.",
      "The reaction to Lacey",
      "There were cheers from all corners of the ground when Lacey was introduced with 30 minutes remaining. The youngster's cameo against Burnley was bright, and fans were excited to see what he could do.",
      "It didn't take long for Lacey to get fans on their feet. He drove at Brighton defender Ferdi Kadioglu, took the ball around him and played a wonderful cross into the box to find Sesko. It was simple old-school wing play, which is becoming rarer in the modern game, and supporters lapped it up. United have traditionally been a club with exciting and fearless wingers in their side.",
      "However, it was a huge shame to see Lacey sent off at the end of the match. The youngster received a second yellow card and looked distraught as he pleaded with the referee not to send him off.",
      "Lacey covered his face with his shirt as he returned to the dressing room and it was heartwarming to see him applauded off. The 18-year-old will come back stronger from the setback.",
      "Fletcher wanted more noise",
      "When Fletcher emerged from the tunnel to take his seat for the second half, he waved his hands to fans in an attempt to increase the noise. He also appeared to exchange words with a supporter as he walked.",
      "United made a brilliant start against Brighton, creating a handful of chances in the opening six minutes. The crowd responded, but the noise dropped when Brighton took the lead and gained control.",
      "Fletcher has the clout to ask for more noise from supporters because of the esteem in which he is held at United. The request might not have gone down well if Ruben Amorim had done the same.",
      "Pre-match accident",
      "There was a nasty-looking accident before the game that could have forced a late change to the starting line-up, as Fernandes received a ball to the face during the warm-up.",
      "Lisandro Martinez was responsible for accidentally sending the ball into Fernandes' face, and he looked shocked as his teammate received treatment. Fernandes' nose was swollen and red. It seemed there was a possibility it could be broken, but the United captain still emerged to lead the team out.",
      "Fernandes' nose was still swollen throughout the game. The TV monitors in the press box showed close-ups when he was in action and confirmed he was playing through the pain barrier.",
      "The United captain is made of stern stuff. He recently missed just four games after picking up a hamstring injury, and he is a throwback to what players of yesteryear were like in an era when players are not as durable.",
      "The directors' box",
      "Paul Scholes and Nicky Butt sat alongside Sir Alex Ferguson in the directors' box to watch the game, which was interesting given Roy Keane recently suggested Ferguson was hanging around United like a \"bad smell\".",
      "Keane has not had a relationship with Ferguson since their dramatic fallout in 2005, which ended his time at United, and that must be remembered when he speaks about the legendary Scot.",
      "Scholes and Butt sitting alongside Ferguson could be perceived as a show of support following Keane's comment, or it was merely coincidental and they were set to attend the FA Cup clash regardless.",
      "Keane is friends with his former teammates Scholes and Butt, which suggests the latter is more likely to be true. Nevertheless, the timing of their presence at the game was interesting.",

      "Robert Lewandowski was also on target, with Rashford coming off the bench for the final eight minutes of normal time. The forward wasted a glorious chance to put the game to bed in stoppage time as his side battled to see out the game with 10 men following Frenkie de Jong’s sending off.",
      "Taking to Instagram after the game, Rashford wrote: “SUPER CUP CHAMPIONS What a way to start the year!!” Rashford completed a season-long loan move to the Spanish giants during the summer transfer window.",
      "The deal includes an option for the La Liga leaders to sign him outright at the end of the season for around £26million. And speaking when he joined the club, he revealed: “This team has the foundations to achieve it.",
      "“Otherwise, they would not have won three trophies last season. The mentality and motivation are high; I don’t see any reason not to win all the trophies we play.”",
      "In an interview with Barca's YouTube channel back in October, Rashford revealed he’s loving life in Spain and is keen to remain at Barca beyond this season. He said: \"I'm really enjoying my time in Spain. The weather is the best part. It's a very big change.",
      "\"I'm learning every day, I'm really enjoying it. I hope to be here for a long time. I get along really well with Roony [Bardghji], as well as Jules [Kounde] and Frenkie [De Jong].",
      "\"It's a team where we all blend together. We're united. The team is fantastic. I just have to be in the right position. I'll keep trying to do this. We have to keep going like this to be our best. We have a lot more to do this season.\"",
      "Marcus Rashford in action for Barcelona(Image: GSI/Icon Sport via Getty Images)",
      "He then continued: \"I'm enjoying this football club and I think for anybody who loves football, Barcelona is one of the key clubs in the history of the game, so to play here is an honour.",
      "\"I just believe that things happen when they're supposed to happen. It's not the first time I spoke with Barcelona about potentially coming here, but for whatever reasons it didn't happen in the past, and now is my opportunity to make it happen.",
      "\"I feel like there's no time like the present now. People forget this, but 23 years of my life was with Manchester United. So sometimes you just need a change.",
      "\"I think maybe this is the case with me and yeah, I'm enjoying everything. I don't feel there is much change in me, I just feel it's a new environment and culture and one I looked forward to coming here.",
      "\"It's just about me adapting and fitting in as well as possible. I'm so hungry to keep improving.\"",

      "Manchester United are out of the FA Cup after they were beaten 2-1 by Brighton at Old Trafford in Darren Fletcher's second game in charge.",
      "United had started the game pretty well but it was Brighton who took the lead after 12 minutes. It was sloppy defending from the hosts, who were exposed down the right and failed to mark in the centre, with Brajan Gruda applying the finishing touch.",
      "Gruda turned provider in the second half, teeing up Danny Welbeck for his customary goal against his former club. Again, the defending was desperately poor.",
      "United got one back late in the game, with Benjamin Sesko heading in a Bruno Fernandes corner, but it came too late to force extra-time. Shea Lacey saw red late on for a second yellow card.",
      "Here are how the players rated at Old Trafford:",
      "Senne Lammens: One horrible moment with the ball at his feet in the first half, when he was lucky he wasn't punished. Did at least shrug it off well. 5",
      "Diogo Dalot: Early miss set the tone. Struggled defensively and got decisions wrong in the final third. Brighton got a lot of joy down United's right. 4",
      "Leny Yoro: In no man's land for both goals and his form is becoming a major concern. Just not alert enough at times to deal with danger and not aware of what's going on around him. 5",
      "Lisandro Martinez: Handed the corner kicks and twice went close from shots in the opposition area, but struggled with the movement of Brighton's attackers. 6",
      "Patrick Dorgu: Moved to another new position and deserves some sympathy for that, but poor defensively. Lost sight of Gruda for both goals. 5",
      "Manuel Ugarte: Passing continues to be a major weakness and United need more from their No.6. His days are numbered. 4",
      "Kobbie Mainoo: Lacking football this season and looked short of rhythm at times. Booked for a bit of a lazy challenge against Welbeck but tried to make things happen. 6",
      "Bruno Fernandes: Tried to influence the game but short of his best. Sent in the corner for the goal and at least tries to lead by example. 6",
      "Mason Mount: Struggled with his role on the right. Made no impact from an attacking point of view and was a weakness defensively when Ferdi Kadıoğlu went forward. 5",
      "Matheus Cunha: His good run of form seems to have ended already. Had a chance to step up recently but hasn't taken it and poor today. 5",
      "Benjamin Sesko: Again got involved and had his share of chances. Needs to time his runs better but deserves credit for his workrate and occupying defenders. 6",
      "Substitutes",
      "Shea Lacey: Some direct wing play that lifted United and created a chance for Sesko. Moment of frustration for second yellow but 18-year-old deserves sympathy and was gutted. 6",
      "Joshua Zirkzee: Didn't make much impact off the bench and another game that seemed to pass him by. 6",
      "Harry Maguire: Nuisance in the opposition box. 6",
      "Casemiro: Little time to make an impact. 6",
      "Subs not used: Bayindir, Heaven, Malacia, J. Fletcher, T. Fletcher",

      "The game may have been caretaker manager Darren Fletcher’s final one in charge, with the club closing in on making a decision on Ruben Amorim’s replacement. United are expected to name an interim manager until the end of the season, before making a more long-term appointment in the summer.",

      "Losses for both Cameroon and the Ivory Coast means that two of the three players - Mbeumo and Amad, will return to Carrington in time for the weekend’s game against City and are therefore expected to be available for selection.",

      "Michael Carrick has emerged as the favourite to be appointed as interim manager at Manchester United - but some fans in the Manchester United comments section aren't holding out much hope of a \"new manager bounce\" that would help them secure a strong finishing position in the Premier League this season.",
      "Ole Gunnar Solskjaer had been the frontrunner for the position, following talks with club chiefs, which would see him return to the club four years after being sacked. Caretaker and U-18s manager Darren Fletcher was unable to overcome Brighton in the FA Cup on Sunday, leaving the club with no chance at silverware this season.",
      "Carrick's most recent job was with Middlesbrough in the Championship, sacked in 2025 after a tenth placed finish. His high points during his time with Middlesbrough were a play-off semi-final against Coventry during his first season, and making it to the semi-finals of the Carabao Cup the following year.",
      "Carrick has managed United in a caretaker capacity twice before, having been a first-team coach at the club back under Jose Mourinho. His stints bookended Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's time in charge, who has fallen behind in the race for the appointment.",
      "It's not an easy job at the best of times, but after Sunday's performance in the FA Cup, few are expecting a sudden upturn in fortunes this season. Reader Jcfc1 says: \"Fletcher has failed his audition in my opnion, although we have looked better than we have in recent weeks. Ole and/or Carrick til the end of the season will do neither good or harm.",
      "\"We just need to get things right from top to bottom. There is no quick fix, we need to learn how to defend, keep clean sheets and be difficult to beat.",
      "\"I'm not sure who the next permanent manager will be, but he needs time, patience, to know his role and know that the board will be difficult to work with.\"",
      "Commenter Mancs R Us is even more pessimistic: \"We would ruin the best manager in the world... The club's rotten from the top table to the pitch, shambles.\"",
      "Gazsco says: \"Whichever United legend is appointed as caretaker manager, we have to accept our season is over and any chance of Champions League football next season vanished when Wilcox threw his toys out of the pram and sacked Amorim.",
      "\"I suppose there's always next season, although I remember saying that every year these days.\"",
      "Some would still prefer Ole at the wheel, like Athyf: \"Ole as the interim manager and Carrick and Nistelrooy as coaching staff would do just fine. They know the club better. Then another league manager can be appointed.\" Man666 agrees: \"Ole is my choice.\"",
      "Michael Carrick looks set to be named boss over Ole Gunnar Solskjaer(Image: Andrew Kearns - CameraSport via Getty Images)",
      "ManUtdObsession says: \"Personally I'd go get Xavi and skip the interim manager. He's available, knows how to play a team game and he's won with Barcelona.",

      "Benjamin Sesko enjoyed his best night in a United shirt against Burnley(Image: )",
      "When Ruben Amorim offered up some mild criticism of Benjamin Sesko earlier this season, as the £73million striker tried to settle into life at Old Trafford, it again set alarm bells ringing amongst Manchester United officials. Amorim had wanted United to sign the more experienced Ollie Watkins, who also came with proven Premier League pedigree, rather than raid RB Leipzig for 22-year-old Sesko, who came with a glowing reputation from director of recruitment Christopher Vivell.",
      "When the Slovenian struggled in the first few months at United, Amorim admitted he was finding the search for form hard, suggested he was taking criticism to heart and said he was a \"control freak\". United officials were bemused by what he wanted to get from the comments.",
      "After his final game in charge at Leeds on Sunday, Amorim was offering a more nuanced view of the only natural striker in his squad, but the bare facts said it all: Sesko had just two goals in 17 appearances under the Portuguese head coach.",
      "He doubled that tally in 90 minutes under Darren Fletcher. Jason Wilcox looked sheepish in the stands all night, with his own role as director of football in the spotlight, but this was a good night for those who backed the decision to sign Sesko over Watkins.",
      "His two goals were superbly taken and he had eight shots in total. It was by some distance his best performance in a United shirt and it came a day after a heart-to-heart with Fletcher. The 41-year-old Scot sat the striker down at Carrington on Tuesday and boosted his confidence with a video that showed his strengths.",
      "He highlighted his movement and reassured him that he was on the right path. A day later he scored twice after making the right runs and getting on the same wavelength as his teammates.",
      "\"I sat down with him yesterday and showed him some videos of his movement and how the opportunities are going to come, to just keep believing, keep making the runs,\" said Fletcher. \"The rest of the team have to look for him more as well.",
      "\"Like with all strikers, once you get that first goal, it builds your confidence, and hopefully they start flooding in from there. I think everyone can see his qualities. I thought he was fantastic tonight. I thought he led the line really well and he maybe could have gone on and had a hat-trick as well.",
      "\"He had a few other opportunities there, another snapshot. It's a real positive night for him and definitely probably the biggest positive from the night really is his two goals.\"",

      "Manchester United interim head coach Darren Fletcher(Image: Michael Regan/Getty Images)",
      "When Darren Fletcher was announced as the interim head coach of Manchester United, there was an immediate expectation that the Scot would make changes when he took charge of the Reds for the trip to Burnley. The first expected change was confirmed in his team selection as the Reds reverted to a back four.",
      "Changing their defensive shape was almost a guarantee considering the issues raised with Ruben Amorim's three-at-the-back system. Amorim's most fatal failing was persisting with his preferred formation when all the signs showed it couldn't be done with the players available.",
      "After a 2-2 draw to struggling Burnley, the jury remains firmly out on whether the back four will make United noticeably better in the long term. However, another change Fletcher made has brought about instant results for the Reds.",
      "Since the summer, Bruno Fernandes has been playing deeper in midfield to make room for Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha in the No.10 roles.",
      "\"I think it's a position that I want Bruno more deep, to have more possession, to try to control the game more - and we're doing that,\" Amorim said in September before admitting: \"Sometimes we miss a little bit Bruno in front, maybe because Matheus Cunha was not there.",
      "\"But if Cunha is there, we have one extra player. So I'm trying just to balance the team and trying to imagine the game, and we'll try to put the best starting line-up there.\"",
      "As Amorim explained, even in the deeper role Fernandes was still influential for the Reds, but there was always the feeling he could offer more if played further forward. In his first game in charge, Fletcher scrapped the Fernandes experiment and put him back into attacking midfield.",
      "Bruno Fernandes with Darren Fletcher after being substituted vs Burnley(Image: )",
      "Fernandes will always play wherever the manager wants him, but United fans have been crying out for him to play more advanced and despite only just coming back from injury this week, the captain showed why this is a better option for United. Within five minutes of the restart, the 31-year-old produced a sublime through ball for Benjamin Sesko to finish.",
      "Due to his minutes being managed, Fernandes only lasted another ten minutes before being substituted but the promising signs are there. United look a better team when Fernandes is playing behind the striker and considering he scored 19 goals from this role last season, moving him further up the pitch makes sense.",
      "This decision is not just better for Fernandes, it also improves the United squad as a whole. When everyone is back fit and available, Mbeumo can play off the right in a 4-2-3-1 system with Cunha cutting in from the left and Fernandes down the middle.",
      "Those wishing to see more of Kobbie Mainoo will also be pleased. With Fernandes pushed further up-field, Mainoo could slot alongside Casemiro to provide a stronger central midfield partnership. A change to Fernandes' role is best for United, his teammates and the captain.",
      "Fernandes has still been influential in midfield this season, but United look a better team when he's played further forward.",

      "Benjamin Sesko had his best game in a United shirt at Turf Moor(Image: )",
      "Manchester United suffered another setback in the race for Champions League football as they were held to a 2-2 draw at Burnley in Darren Fletcher's first game in charge. United started slowly and went behind after 13 minutes. Casemiro was caught out by Bashir Humphreys' run and Ayden Heaven's weak attempt at blocking the cross saw the ball loop in off the centre-back.",
      "Fletcher's side soon took control and two Benjamin Sesko goals in the first 15 minutes of the second half looked to have turned it around. He finished smartly from a Bruno Fernandes pass and Patrick Dorgu cross. Somehow, United let the hosts back into it. They had barely threatened in the second half when Lisandro Martinez let Jaidon Anthony turn and deliver a curling finish.",
      "Here are how the players rated at Turf Moor:",
      "Senne Lammens: Decision to try and read the cross from Humphreys not a good one but powerless with the second goal. Good with the ball at his feet. 6",
      "Diogo Dalot: Tidy in possession and tried to get forward in the second half, but didn't have much of an impact. United's narrow approach didn't get him much of the ball. 6",
      "Ayden Heaven: Turned away from the cross that saw the ball loop in off him, when he should have made himself bigger. Aggressive on the ball at times. 5",
      "Lisandro Martinez: His weakest game since his return to the side. One wild shot and way too passive against Anthony in the area, giving the winger too much space to equalise. 5",
      "Luke Shaw: Got forward well and had an impact in that area. Linked well with Dorgu and made some clever runs, both overlapping and underlapping. 7",
      "Manuel Ugarte: Got quite far forward at times, and although his two shots at goal were wayward, he had a solid game and was better with the ball. 6",
      "Casemiro: A shadow of the player who had done so well earlier in the season. Just watched Humphreys run off him for the first goal, was booked and just too slow to react at times. 4",
      "Bruno Fernandes: Picked a brilliant pass to create the equaliser for Sesko and wanted as much of the ball as he could get. Looked a creative force. 7",
      "Patrick Dorgu: Playing everywhere at the moment. Something of a surprise to see him on the left but gave Kyle Walker a hard time and his cross was perfect for Sesko. 7",
      "Matheus Cunha: Quieter than he has been in recent weeks. Struggled on the right in the first half and didn't improve much for being moved centrally. 6",
      "Benjamin Sesko: His best game for the club. Had plenty of chances, held the ball up well, took his two goals brilliantly and forced Martin Dúbravka into another good save with a fine header. 8",
      "Substitutes",
      "Leny Yoro: Another centre-half change. Did fine. 6",
      "Mason Mount: Struggled to match the impact of Fernandes. 6",
      "Kobbie Mainoo: Came on in a deep area and tried to get on the ball. 6",
      "Joshua Zirkzee: Couple of half chances but couldn't take them. 6",
      "Shea Lacey: So unlucky not to score with a brilliant piece of play. 7",
      "Subs not used: Bayindir, Maguire, Malacia, J. Fletcher",

      "Jason Wilcox and Omar Berrada at Turf Moor.(Image: 2026 Getty Images)",
      "Manchester United insiders have questioned the mentality of the dressing room this season because points have often been dropped from winning positions in the Premier League. United conceded first against Burnley at Turf Moor on Wednesday night, but they fought back to lead in the second half after a Benjamin Sesko brace.",
      "Just six minutes after Sesko fired United into the lead, Burnley forward Jaidon Anthony found the back of the net to ensure the points were shared. Only West Ham, Chelsea and Bournemouth have dropped more points from winning positions than United this season. The Reds have lost a total of 14 points from winning positions.",
      "It's understood that United insiders have questioned the mentality of the players, who have often failed to demonstrate the know-how to see out a victory after taking the lead this term. United insiders believe they should have won against Burnley, which Darren Fletcher admitted when he spoke about dropping points during his post-match press conference.",
      "\"It's a good question,\" he said. \"My experience is only tonight, so I experienced that. We get 2-1 up and then I felt we were a bit passive again. We sat in a little bit and maybe we should have gone for the kill and gone for the third goal.",
      "\"It all happened very quickly as well, so I've not had chance to reflect on that yet. So that's something that we'll try and look at, but it's a little bit new just now. It's a little bit fresh, so it's probably going to take a little bit of time to sit back and reflect on the game, watch it back and then try and figure out why these things keep happening.\"",
      "Fletcher added: \"I think you can get in that cycle with a little bit of confidence. I think in terms of like, there's a little bit of a feeling that can you see the game out or can you go on and win it and that's not deemed to be there yet.",
      "\"And that can only build through time and confidence and actually winning some football games and finding out what it takes to win games. Sometimes you might put in a good performance but you've got to find a way to win ugly and see out a match and it might not be pretty.",
      "\"That may be from keeping the ball, that may be from defending deep as a team, whatever that is. But the team need to figure out how to put in performances that win them games and then hopefully from there that confidence can grow.\"",
      "United have dropped points against the Premier League's bottom seven teams across the last 10 weeks: Tottenham, Bournemouth, Leeds, Nottingham Forest, West Ham, Burnley and Wolves.",

      "Ole Gunnar Solskjaer was sacked by Besiktas in August(Image: Anadolu via Getty Images)",
      "To a casual observer, it would be easy to cast Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's last foray into management with Besiktas as a failure.",
      "Sacked after just eight months in charge after failing to qualify for either the Europa League or the Europa Conference League doesn't look great on paper for the man in contention to return to Manchester United as interim boss. But that doesn't tell the full story of Solskjaer's time in Turkey, according to football journalist and Besiktas podcaster Kaan Bayazit.",
      "Solskjaer was appointed by a club in crisis one year ago, before lifting them from seventh to a fourth-place finish in the Super Lig. He pulled off a memorable Europa League win over Athletic Bilbao in his first match and beat their arch city rivals, Galatasaray, to retain a proud club milestone.",
      "On the mess Solskjaer inherited 12 months ago, following the sacking of Giovanni Van Bronckhorst, Bayazit told MEN Sport: \"It was probably the lowest point I'd seen Besiktas at in my 25 years of following the club. It was a really difficult job to come into.",
      "\"It was seen as impossible to win his first game against Athletic Club [Bilbao], who were on a really good run in La Liga and top of the Europa League table. But they played the best football they had played all season and deservedly won 4-1. The start was very positive and got the players on the same page.\"",
      "Solskjaer led Besiktas to some memorable victories(Image: Anadolu via Getty Images)",
      "Bayazit admits Solskjaer's style of play wasn't easy on the eye but it was case of needs must at the time. He said: \"It wasn't great. That was largely due to the limitations of the squad. The football was, at times, decent but never scintillating to watch.",
      "\"They only had one true winger. Right after Ole got sacked, they did bring in wingers but he never got to work with those players and I think that's the main reason for the team not being fluid under him.",
      "\"He was adamant about the fact that he needed wingers but never got the chance. I think he got the most out of the players for the most part, especially in the big games.\"",
      "Those big games included a win over Galatasaray that preserved a piece of Besiktas history. Bayazit said: \"He's the first manager to win all three big domestic matches in a single half of a season since Besiktas won the league in 2021.",
      "\"He beat Fenerbahçe, Trabzonspor and Galatasray. It was Galatasaray's only loss of the season, which was very significant for Besiktas because they're the only 'Invincibles' in Turkish football history, so beating them was very important.\"",
      "Solskjaer lost his job because of a panicky president, according to Kaan Bayazit(Image: Anadolu via Getty Images)",
      "However, Solskjaer still didn't have enough credit in the bank to survive losing in the play-off rounds of both the Europa League and Europa Conference League at the start of the season. Bayazit is adamant Solskjaer didn't deserve the sack and that he was a victim of a president who caved to media pressure.",
      "\"I would say he did a great job, even though his tenure had its ups and downs,\" he said. \"I don't think he should have got sacked when he did. I think he did a very good job with the tools he was handed. He had his legs cut from under him by a president who doesn't have the backbone to resist some media pressure.",
      "\"I don't think he was sufficiently backed by the president. Two weeks before he sacked him, he said, 'We're backing him.' The president has a tenure for three years, then he has to get re-elected, so there is a lot of pressure on them for instant success.",
      "\"But Ole definitely wasn't backed and I would say the Turkish media really had it out for him. Despite the fact he is a model professional and a gentleman, he doesn't leak stuff to the media. He didn't give the media breadcrumbs.\"",
      "Bayazit saw enough of Solskjaer at Besiktas to suggest he is the right short-term option for United following Ruben Amorim's sacking. He added: \"I think it would be great for United. He has the ability to bring that team together again.",
      "\"A lot of those players have been told by Ruben Amorim that they aren't good enough. I think that's something Ole will be able to solve short-term.",
      "Solskjaer would help solve some of United's short-term issues, according to Besiktas podcaster Bayazit(Image: Getty)",
      "\"I don't know if he is the person to take them back to their glory days. I said the same about him at Besiktas, that I didn't know if he could get us back to winning trophies. But at the time, he was the best option because he stabilised things and brought joy back to the players.",
      "\"I think Ole should have been given a lot more time at Besiktas; he could have laid the groundwork for future success with stability around him, which he didn't get. For Manchester United, he is a good option because they're not going to get a top manager at the moment.\"",
      "As a close follower of English football too, Bayazit believes there are similarities between Besiktas and United. He said: \"I've got to know a lot of Manchester United fans recently and the resemblance between them and Besiktas is remarkable, from the state of the squad, backroom politics, the noise around the club, the pressure.",
      "\"That's something people who don't follow Turkish football don't realise. The pressure is so much bigger than 95 per cent of football clubs. Only the biggest clubs in the world know the pressure of the three biggest clubs in Turkey. It's from the fans, the media.",
      "\"I think Ole did well with the pressure. It's a regretful that he got sacked when he did and it sent the club into more chaos. It speaks volumes about what he did in a relative short period of time, because he did bring some stability. But it got blown up by the president who's very reactionary.\"",

The group have confirmed that demonstrations against the United hierarchy are set to take place ahead of their clash with Fulham on February 1.",
      "The group have slammed the handling of Ruben Amorim's tenure at Old Trafford describing performances on the pitch as \"medicore\" and \"chaos\" off it. Minority shareholder Sir Jim Ratcliffe has been described as an \"incompetent clown\" after failing to successfully steer the club toward greater heights.",
      "Amorim was sacked by United on Monday, hours after his explosive outburst in the aftermath of their 1-1 draw with Leeds United at Elland Road. Darren Fletcher has taken charge on an interim basis and oversaw the encounter against Burnley, which finished 2-2, and will be in the dugout for the FA Cup third round tie against Premier League rivals, Brighton.",
      "The protest brings fresh pressure on the Glazer family, Ratcliffe, and now the new-look footballing operations team at the Theatre of Dreams.",
      "There is anger among the supporters who they feel like they have been priced out, marginalised and being treated as an inconvenience.",
      "A protest was held at the end of last season, prior to the showdown with Aston Villa, that saw supporters join forces to voice their concerns about the football club after one of their worst campaigns in top-flight history, which saw them finish 15th in the Premier League and lose in the Europa League final to Tottenham Hotspur.",
      "There had been plans to protest United's Premier League opener against Arsenal, however they were scrapped in light of criticism directed at the decision to include Ratcliffe in the action against the Glazer's control of the club.",

Statements against the board have already began to emerge and did so during the 2-2 draw at Turf Moor on Wednesday, a banner was unfurled in the away end claiming: \"Jim can't fix this.\"",
      "United sit just outside the Champions League places but missed out on another opportunity to break into the top four with Benjamin Sesko's double not enough against Scott Parker's side.",
      "Amorim faced frequent pressure after failing to heed the downturn in results that led to Erik ten Hag's dismissal. The former Sporting CP head coach has been at the helm for numerous low points during his tenure at the club, including defeat in the Carabao Cup to League Two side Grimsby.",
      "A spokesperson for The 1958 group said: “It has been an extraordinary and deeply troubling few days at Manchester United. On the pitch, we are watching mediocre performances from an average team drifting without identity, direction, or ambition. Off it, the chaos is even worse.",
      "“A manager has reportedly been dismissed not primarily for abject performances against Grimsby, Everton, West Ham, and Wolves, but allegedly for a heated exchange with Jason Wilcox. Wilcox a man with just nine months’ experience as a Director of Football at Southampton is said to have attempted to interfere tactically, despite the club hiring Ruben fully aware of his rigid system. The situation beggar’s belief.",
      "“This decision was allegedly endorsed by Omar Berrada, a CEO with no prior experience in the role, listening to the complaints of a close ally rather than exercising independent leadership. We are once again witnessing Manchester United being run by executives learning on the job, at the expense of results, stability, and credibility.",
      "“Let us be clear: this is not a defence of Ruben or the football served up under him. Much of it was unacceptable. But his dismissal once again exposes the continued dysfunction at our club. Manchester United is now a toxic partnership where fans are getting the worst of both worlds.",

      "Darren Fletcher has backed Shea Lacey to play a \"big part\" in Manchester United's future after the 18-year-old's impressive cameo at Turf Moor in Fletcher's first game in charge. The 18-year-old came on with six minutes to go against Burnley and hit the crossbar with one superb strike before sending another shot from range fizzing just wide of the post.",
      "It was Lacey's second appearance for the first team and the first sign of the talent that has marked him out as one to watch within the academy. Fletcher showed faith in throwing him on as United chased a winner and the youngster almost delivered.",
      "\"I said to him, stay wide and go and do what you do, and he did that,\" said Fletcher. \"I know he's gonna make an impact. I know he's creative. He's got goals in him. He's exciting, he's direct, he's fearless, and he hit the crossbar, and he had another shot, so he had a really bright game.",
      "\"I'm pleased for him because there have been a lot of injuries in recent years, and he's not really got going with his momentum, but we know the talent that he's got, and he'll be a big part of Manchester United's future. I've no doubts about that.\"",
      "Lacey's efforts were part of a much better attacking display from United, who had 30 shots against the Clarets. They hit the woodwork twice, had two cleared off the line and saw a Lisandro Martinez goal controversially disallowed for a foul.",
      "Fletcher had told his players to go out and entertain, and he was pleased to see United produce a much better attacking display.",
      "\"It was about them to be proactive, to attack, to go and highlight themselves, go and showcase the abilities they have as individuals and as players and be really front-foot, proactive, exciting,\" he said. \"They were the challenges that we put towards them and they did that.",
      "\"I think, as I said, it wasn't perfect, but there was lots of good things within that. I think if we look back on that game, barring probably the start and then after we went 2-1 up, I think the rest of the game is pretty much total domination and creating lots of chances.",

United believe they have signed a young goalkeeper with huge potential, and fans who were present at Old Trafford against Sunderland left the stadium buzzing about his debut.",

      "\"He was one of the guys during Covid - when the players were not able to train - who was doing a lot at home, he was really going far with this to be the best in these types of areas.",
      "\"Then he continued like this when he joined the first team to train with them. He always wanted to improve. We also had something in place to look at the parameters on which goalkeepers are judged.",
      "\"You see the potential of the goalkeeper based on what they do in games; so their positioning, their decision-making and so on, and Senne was always quite high in these areas.",
      "\"The only bad luck that he had was that the first-team goalkeeper was Simon Mignolet. He's an amazing goalkeeper, so it was difficult for Senne to stay over there in the role of No.2.",
      "\"That would have also blocked his growth, so it was good for him in the end to make the step to go to Antwerp and he did a tremendous job there. It was amazing to see how fast he adapted.\"",
      "Milkon pictured during his stint with Club Brugge (he now manages F.C.V. Dender).(Image: )",
      "Milkon continued: \"I think for us at Club Brugge, it was very clear to everyone that Senne was a top goalkeeper. He would have been the perfect fit for Club Brugge to be the No.1.",
      "\"That was not possible because Mignolet was there. But the parameters that we used to judge his performances indicated he was ticking so many boxes already, and he was consistently doing it.",
      "\"There weren't ups and downs with his performances. He was consistently really high and when you compare this to the top goalkeepers, you have a benchmark to say 'Ok, what potential does this guy have?'",
      "\"He had some chances with the first team at Club Brugge and made a mistake, or maybe two, but in the end it was very clear to everyone that he was a top goalkeeper.",
      "\"It was impossible to try to extend his contract because, again, you have Mignolet, and you cannot block a guy like this. You know he has to go out, he has to play, and he will improve even more.\"",
      "When asked about Lammens' strengths, he said: \"I would say that his decision-making was very good. He is very calm, he sees the solutions on the pitch, he has a quick reaction time and understands the balance between risk and reward, and which decisions are the right ones to make.",
      "\"His clean passing is great, his footwork was really good, and he's just an amazing goalkeeper with the shot-stopping. He made some incredible saves back then already. He's quite a complete goalkeeper.",
      "\"But making the right decisions at a very young age, being very mature with this, was really impressive. And the fact that he is good with both feet is another big strength.",
      "\"For me, Senne is a very calm guy and has all the qualities to be a top professional. That was my impression when I first met him when he was younger and he never changed.\"",
      "A baby-faced Lammens playing for Club Brugge in 2021. (Image: 2021 BSR Agency)",
      "Lammens joined Royal Antwerp on a free transfer in the summer of 2023. He was handed his debut a few months later and served as an understudy that season, but earned first-choice status for 2024/2025.",
      "His performances drew attention from the Belgian media. Lammens saved four penalties across a successful first full campaign and received a call-up to Belgium's senior squad in March.",
      "Milkon said: \"I was not surprised when I saw Manchester United had come calling. And to record his first clean sheet, I was really happy for him. Senne is a potential No.1 for the Red Devils - the Belgium national team.",
      "\"He got his chance, he took it, and we're all really proud of him, but we knew it would happen. I believe he has all the capabilities to become the best in the world, so I wish him all the best. I'm sure he will have a very good career in England, and Manchester United should return to the big club they used to be.",
      "\"He will have a positive impact on that, for sure, and hopefully he will be Belgium's first-choice goalkeeper soon. I believe he has the potential, the skillset and the personality to do that.",
      "\"For me, it was just having a tiny little part in having an influence on him at Brugge, but it was the most positive memories of our relationship that we had during this spell.",
      "\"I'm very proud that he is reaching these high levels and not surprised. I believe he will be successful because he is a guy who will not change his focus or start to do something different. He is calm, that's his personality and character, and he wants to succeed. He is hungry and will keep working to be his best.",
      "\"He is so calm, and you have to be patient in football. You cannot worry too much and want things too early, but finding the balance between not being impatient and, at the same time, pushing and demanding what you deserve in a good way, means everything will sort itself out.\"",
      "Lammens in action for Royal Antwerp in 2024. (Image: Photonews 2024)",
      "United staff who have worked with Lammens at Carrington have echoed Milkon's sentiments. He has been described as \"really mature for his age\" and is said to have taken the move in his stride.",
      "Lammens is understood to have impressed coaches during training sessions and a United source said that lots of people have been speaking positively about him. He has already relocated from the luxury hotel where he was initially staying and into a house.",
      "It's no surprise that Lammens likes to play basketball at 6ft 3in, but he is a keen golfer, which is common ground with the likes of Tom Heaton, Luke Shaw, Mason Mount and Harry Maguire.",
      "Matthijs de Ligt, Amad, Maguire and Shaw jogged straight to Lammens to congratulate him after full-time against Sunderland. \"Are you Schmeichel in disguise?\" was chanted at Lammens from the Stretford End.",
      "It remains to be seen whether Lammens will start against Liverpool on Sunday, but it would be a surprise to see him on the bench after delivering a strong debut before the international break.",
      "There would be nothing boring about keeping another clean sheet - this time at Anfield.",

      "Still, it was very clear that if Amorim remained in charge, Mainoo was finished. The manager did not trust the England star to play at the base of his midfield and he was way down the pecking order for the more advanced positions. A parting seemed inevitable…another academy product sold off and most likely to go and be a huge success elsewhere.",
      "But Amorim’s exit makes that prospect far more remote. There is a role for Mainoo in a 4-2-3-1 or a 4-3-3, but the 20-year-old still has plenty to prove after almost a lost year.",

These Red Devils evidently don’t catch on quick (ask Ralf Rangnick), so it makes complete sense to simplify things, and the principles of defending in a back four are less taxing on the brain.",

      "That is not to say that Fletcher promoted Lacey ahead of time for his own ends; the teenager has earned his promotion. But Fletcher has clearly been more willing than Amorim to facilitate it.",
      "Coming off the right flank, Lacey was bright against Burnley, almost scoring a stunner with his first senior touches, and against Brighton, it was evident his senior team-mates trust him. Of course, his two yellow cards were stupid and United have to hope it serves as a steep learning curve. But Lacey has whetted the appetite for more cameos through the remainder of the season.",
      "To ham up his association with the academy and all that represents at United, Fletcher could have included 15-year-old JJ Gabriel in his squad for Brighton. That he didn’t is a positive. At least let the lad finish school before throwing him into the circus ring.",

      "That’ll happen when you don’t see the ball. Granted, there have been times when it has been slung his way and he’s been shrugged off it too easily for a lad of 6’5″, but far too much of his involvement in United’s play was far too far from the opposition goal.",
      "That seemed to change against Burnley. Not only did he score twice, doubling his tally through the first 16 games in one night, but there was undeniably a greater emphasis on finding Sesko around the box. His two goals came as a result of seven shots on target – the most any player has managed in a single Premier League game this season.",
      "Another goal though ultimately inconsequential followed against Brighton, with his three goals all different finishes: a first-time volley to meet a cross; a one-v-one after a run in behind; and a header from a set-piece.",

      "From United’s perspective, hopefully there is still time to show Fernandes that it doesn’t have to be this bleak because literally no one would trust the club to replace his record-breaking creativity – he’s created double the number of chances of any other United player – in a summer when they are preoccupied with a manager.",
      "On that, Fletcher has made a positive start simply by playing Fernandes in a position closer to his best. Under Amorim, he had to play at the base of the midfield and he made a decent fist of things. But United – and Sesko – need him closer to the opposition goal.",
      "Against Brighton and Burnley (he played only an hour upon return from injury) in attacking midfield positions, Fernandes created five chances in each game, above his season average of 3.3 per 90. At Turf Moor, his withdrawal and United’s loss of control was no coincidence.",

      "Man Utd need to present a project to Xavi “that aligns with his idea of the football that he wants to put in place”, according to Gaizka Mendieta.",
      "The Red Devils sacked Ruben Amorim earlier this month as they look to go in a different direction after a terrible 14 months at Old Trafford.",
      "Man Utd finished 15th in the Premier League last season and continued their inconsistent form this season, with the Red Devils seventh in the table but just six points ahead of 15th-placed Bournemouth.",
      "The Red Devils, who lost 2-1 to Brighton in the FA Cup on Sunday, are set to appoint a new interim boss until the end of the season with former midfielder Michael Carrick now the frontrunner for the job.",
      "Man Utd will then appoint a permanent successor to Amorim in the summer with Crystal Palace’s Oliver Glasner, England’s Thomas Tuchel and Germany’s Julian Nagelsmann among the host of names linked.",

      "READ: Man Utd run by over-promoted dunderheeds; this is not on players or managers",
      "Romano said last week: “What I can say is that Xavi would love to coach in the Premier League. He feels ready to return to coaching and write a new chapter after his departure from Barcelona and taking some time to disconnect.",
      "“He is ready and very open to managing in the Premier League one day, but at the moment, I am not aware of negotiations between Xavi and Manchester United.”",
      "And now Xavi’s former Barcelona and Spain team-mate Mendieta has outlined the 45-year-old’s conditions for taking on the role at Old Trafford.",
      "Mendieta told Boyle Sports: “Xavi would definitely understand what a club like Manchester United needs in terms of the history and how the fans demand trophies.",
      "“I think that’s probably in line with Barca when he joined them. Knowing Xavi, I think what would be a priority though, is the project. It’s a huge club, but he will need to see something that makes him really want to do it.",
      "“It’s something that he needs to be excited about. He wouldn’t join just because it’s United, but because there’s a project behind it. It needs to be a project that aligns with his idea of the football that he wants to put in place.",
      "“He would not go just for the sake of being Man Utd manager, he would need to be given the tools he needs to play his type of football.”",
      "When asked about his future last year, Xavi revealed: “Of course? Where, I don’t know.There’s no hurry for me, but I’d like a good project.",
      "“Like, ‘You have four years to work and make a project.’ I’d love to work in the Premier League because I love the passion there. In Spain, it’s too much about the result.",
      "“Or a national team, that would appeal. When I dreamed about being a coach, I dreamed about being in a World Cup or European Championship.”",

      "If you’re 30, it’s been like this your entire adult life.",
      "After watching their loss in the cup, you couldn’t help feeling sorry for them. Even Darren Fletcher wore a sorrowful, hollow-eyed look, looking less like a caretaker and more like an undertaker standing graveside. In his post-game interview he already looks broken by the experience.",

      "Working on the basis that everyone looks better when they leave (Scott McTominay’s career seems to be a permanent case of ‘look at what you could have won’ with two more goals on Sunday), that must apply to the current iteration too. In other words, they can’t actually be that bad. But everyone tells them they are, all of the time. It has to be demoralising for a previously highly-rated player. Certainly every bit of skill, decent pass etc, seems immediately followed by a clumsy error.",
      "Just when they got back into the Brighton game, they picked up a red card. It sometimes feels like self-sabotage. There are roars as they go on the attack, which immediately turn to groans as a pass goes astray or is intercepted. At the final whistle, they all looked bereft, their season already effectively over. Highly remunerated under-performers stealing a handsome living. It’s embarrassing.",

A collection of over-promoted dunderheeds who are trying to pretend they’re professionals, who never answer for their poor choices. or have the first clue how to run a football club. But they can’t admit this, not even to themselves.",
      "This results in a Mr Magoo management style, where they blindly careen from one disaster to another, unable to see how pathetic they look or realise that everyone is laughing at them. There are good examples of better ways to run a club but they seem impervious to them, doubtless arrogant enough to feel they’ll do it their own way. Arrogance and misplaced self-confidence are a particularly toxic mix.",
      "Whatever financial acumen Sir Jim Ratcliffe has had, he clearly doesn’t possess anymore. We have chronicled 19 mistakes, some of which are so feeble, only a total fool would have even thought to do them. But with the arrogance of someone who’s made money, he can’t bring himself to believe he’s been wrong about anything ay all.",
      "Look at the way they’ve treated Bruno Fernandes, who now seems set to leave in the summer. It may be a low bar to qualify as United’s best player but it’s not sensible to alienate him and treat him like a prime cut of beef to be sold at a premium. Only to compound their idiocy, they don’t actually sell him, leaving a man on the books who feels disrespected and the team’s confidence on the floor. Stupid at every turn.",

      "Like this? Love F365? Make us one of your preferred sources on Google.",
      "The task of running the club is patently beyond them. They got so big in the successful years that it was a wild dog; they thought if they just kept feeding it red meat, it would never turn on them and they would never need to have a plan B. Obviously they don’t know what they’re doing and are making fools of themselves. But they see themselves as competent execs being let down by the players. It must be galling for the staff.",
      "As an example of some of the worst contemporary management styles, they can’t be beaten, frequently making terrible decisions that any of us could warn them against. Jason Wilcox has got a lot wrong and yet is kept in a job. What would he have to do to be dismissed? And what next? Install Tim Sherwood as club hairdresser?",
      "The players have to perform with clown cars bursting into flames all over the place, all of the time. Is it any wonder things sank to a nadir and have barely recovered? It’s clear to everyone that the problems with everything stem from this idiotic ownership. You can’t expect a team to perform well in a toxic atmosphere which is telling them they’re rubbish. Admittedly, they are rubbish, but they said that about Rasmus Højlund and he’s transformed at Napoli, which is hardly a model of stability. United is a curse for players that cannot be lifted.",
      "Every poor performance is another humiliation, not just a mid-table team losing. And the poor performances aren’t just narrow losses. Like against Brighton, they’re played off the park and look totally deflated.",
      "Obviously, playing staff isn’t the problem. They can play well, but not for United. They’re not useless wasters, even if United seem to have turned them into exactly that. Until the entire ownership goes away, the problems will continue. But history suggests they’ll keep throwing money at it to ever-decreasing effect and the players will continue to be booed for the failures of amateur executives who’ll continue to say nothing.

      "“Back in the day, United had four or five strikers. You think about Andy Cole, Dwight Yorke, Teddy Sheringham, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer. Then they had young lads coming through: Wayne Rooney, Cristiano Ronaldo, [Carlos] Tevez.",

      "Ole Gunnar Solskjaer\nSolskjaer was a surprise choice to step in when Jose Mourinho burned his bridges at Manchester United in December 2018. His senior management credentials consisted of a couple of spells at Molde in Norway around a failed tenure at Cardiff.",
      "But United didn’t need tactical acumen and complex man-management nous, apparently. All that was required was a big smile, an abundance of positivity and endless references to 1999 to lift the Mourinho fog.",
      "Solskjaer was due to return to Molde at the end of the season but United stumbled upon the next Sir Alex Ferguson when they appointed their former striker. Or so it seemed from the Red Devils’ form. Under Solskjaer, the Red Devils went unbeaten for a dozen Premier League games, winning 10, before a stunning fightback to beat PSG in the Champions League last 16.",
      "So giddy were United after that night in Paris, they gave Solskjaer a three-year contract. Which was hardly the wrong call at the time. We all egged them on.",
      "But, alarmingly quickly, it all went to sh*t. Solskjaer’s players reverted to type, taking their foot off the gas to win only two of their last 12 games.",
      "Solskjaer’s two full seasons in charge brought third and second-placed finishes, but never did he convince the majority that he was the right man for such a prestigious position. His third campaign was a disaster, leading to the sack when United dropped to eighth with an appalling defeat at Watford. United appointed another interim, Ralf Rangnick, but the players paid due attention for roughly 12 minutes.",
      "He wanted to repeat the trick after the sacking of Ruben Amorim but it seems the club has chosen Michael Carrick instead.",

      "Roberto di Matteo\nChelsea were fifth in the Premier League, three points behind the top four – and were still in two of the other three competitions open to them – when Andre Villas-Boas was sacked at the start of March in 2012. In relative terms, this was not even close to a crisis. But at a club that had not finished outside the top three during Roman Abramovich’s ownership, panic buttons were pressed far more readily.",
      "Villas-Boas’s assistant was subsequently thrust into the limelight. Di Matteo won his first four games in charge, including a famous 4-1 victory over Napoli in extra time of their Champions League last 16 second leg, and a crushing 5-2 win over Leicester in the FA Cup quarter-final. He would go on to beat Tottenham 5-1 in the semi-final and Liverpool 2-1 in the final to lift one trophy, but that was only the half of it.",
      "After the thrill of the Napoli tie, Chelsea strode past Benfica comfortably in the quarter-finals. Against all odds, Barcelona were beaten in a Gary Neville orgasm-inducing semi-final, before Bayern Munich found the Di Matteo tidal wave irresistible in the final. From caretaker to history-maker, Di Matteo had finally delivered Abramovich’s holy grail, 18 months after being sacked by West Brom.",

Appointed caretaker manager of the flailing but reigning First Division champions in February 1982, Aston Villa’s former chief scout made enough of an instant impact to be given the permanent job within a couple of months.",
      "Barton oversaw no miraculous improvement in league form, taking Villa from a relegation-threatened 17th to a safely mid-table 11th. But again, it was in Europe where he conjured magic from nothing. By the time Dynamo Kiev were beaten in the European Cup quarter-finals, Barton’s future in the hotseat was still far from certain.",
      "Two weeks after that success, Barton was given a three-year contract. But the honeymoon had only just begun: Tony Morley laid waste to Anderlecht in the semi-finals, before Peter Withe helped slay Bayern Munich in Rotterdam. Having begun the season with no prior first-team coaching experience, he ended it inflicting Bayern’s first ever defeat in a European Cup final.",
      "Villa simply couldn’t keep that remarkable pace. They finished sixth the following season, reaching the quarter-finals in defence of their European crown.

      "A five-game unbeaten run was ended with three consecutive defeats in March, as the club continued to struggle for consistency. But six wins in their last seven games lifted them into seventh, and meant that Roeder won ten of his 15 league matches in charge, compared to Souness’ seven wins in 23. Yes, he was given the permanent job. Yes, he barely lasted a full season. There’s a theme here.",

They found themselves in actual dire straits when he returned for a second stint in December 2015, but the Dutchman took them from one point outside the relegation zone to mid-table comfort.",

As Roy Hodgson was busy picking fights with Frank Rijkaard, signing Milan Jokanovic, losing to Northampton Town and admitting Liverpool were “in a relegation battle” as early as October, the spectre of Kenny loomed.

They lost their first two games but an eight-match unbeaten run restored some pride on Merseyside. A 3-1 win over Manchester United, assisted by the worst hat-trick in Premier League history, saw the Reds finish strongly in sixth.",
      "Dalglish was rewarded with a three-year contract in May 2011, but his permanent reign is less fondly remembered. He was sacked after just one full season that included two cup finals, an eighth-placed finish and a misguided, regrettable defence of actual racism from one of his players.",

      "READ: Man Utd fans plead for Wilcox sack after season ends v Brighton",

      "“Ole Gunnar Solskjaer immediately made himself available via his agents after Ruben Amorim was sacked. Manchester United had a meeting with Solskjaer and it was a good one. He is ready to help the club and very excited about the opportunity.",

He’s married, has kids and something of a career but cant forget those glory days of 1998-2001.",
      "Watching the game the United fans stuck me as the same – all the songs were about Cantona, about Solksjaer (I appreciate he’s just left as manager), even one about Scholes. It’s not just the singing, they wanted Ronaldo, not just because he was once one of the world’s top two but more strongly because he was a link to the past. How many times does the camera cut back to the crowd to pick out Ferguson?",

Old Trafford is rapidly going the way of the old Wembley – full of football nostalgia but in no way a stadium for the 21st century.

I also wrote that I don’t think he has been helped by “Handsome Hughes” changing half the team. Allow me to explain a bit further.",
      "Last year, as soon as we won the ball, a defender would look to Diaz or Nunez for a quick break; a ball over the top or down the line was often the option. If that wasn’t on, VVD would look for the cross-field ball to Salah. However, with those two quick outlets now gone, and the resulting change in style, these options are no longer available.",
      "The slower transition has led to a more congested midfield, which in turn has negated last year’s other outlet: the drilled pass into Gravenberch, allowing him to turn the press and glide through the centre of the park.",
      "With Slot putting Frimpong wide and high on Thursday, the team finally seemed to rediscover a bit of last year’s mojo. Yes, there were no shots on target, but Frimpong’s pace and directness forced Arsenal to drop deeper in the second half. This, in turn, gave Gravenberch and Mac Allister space to pass between the lines and break the press, something we had not managed for several months.",
      "I only hope that Slot recognised this and keeps Frimpong higher up the pitch despite Bradley’s injury. Sometimes, playing a lesser player in the correct position, while keeping the other ten in their natural roles, is the better option. I am reminded of when we lost all four centre-backs five years ago and played the inexperienced Nat Phillips and Rhys Williams. Keeping them at centre-back allowed Henderson and Fabinho to remain in midfield and helped us secure a top-four finish.",
      "Speaking of the top four, I am heartened by Man United reverting to type when trying to find a solution to their 253rd crisis since Sir Alex left. However, if I were on the interview panel and a candidate mentioned “Fergie” and DNA, I would thank them, end the interview, and reject them out of hand. Sir Alex is a legend, one of the best managers of all time. He deserves his stand, a statue, and everything that comes with it.",
      "But hearing that interims, caretakers, and members of the Class of ’99 still seek his advice, permission, and even refuse to park in his space is embarrassing. Guys, it’s been 13 years. Bill Shankly was asked to stop coming to the training ground because of his status. In Klopp’s first interview, he said (circa) that the weight of history is like a backpack, it needs to come off. United (and I am quite happy that they are) are choosing to carry this Fergie-sized bag.",
      "Onto another example of sycophancy. I am surprised that so little has been made of the atrocious coverage of the Arsenal–Liverpool game on Thursday. I don’t think Liverpool were praised as much for winning the league as Arsenal are for being six points clear. The noises from Nevillier and the fawning adjectives pouring from the a$$-chapped lips of Drury were embarrassing. The producer and director also spent more time showing the Lego Sith Lord than I have seen devoted to other managers combined this season.",
      "This continued, unwarranted flattery is one of the reasons the club, in general, behaves so appallingly. The manager demands, and receives, respect he has not yet earned. A reminder to the suck-ups: he has spent close to a billion pounds and has one FA Cup and three second-place finishes in a beauty contest to show for it. Being constantly told you are brilliant and the best has fuelled Arteta’s ego and afforded him a level of impunity, evident in his touchline antics.",
      "Persistently operating outside his technical area, instructing his players to slow the game down at set pieces (then complaining when others do the same), and, in one instance, dragging an injured player back onto the pitch to time-waste sends a message to his squad. This is why I think Martinelli acted as he did. It is learned behaviour from the one person at the club who should know and act better. A few years ago, F365 ran an excellent comparison of Klopp and Arteta; it may be worth dusting off for a new generation.",
      "So I am torn. I don’t believe Liverpool or Villa will win the league, which leaves a choice between this Arsenal side or Man (115) City. Which of the two would be the least soul-destroying?",
      "I need a drink already.",
      "Have a great week all,\nIan H",
      "",
      "I beg you to sell this thing. Beg you.",
      "You are motivated by money. That’s ok. We live in late-stage capitalism. Everything is for sale. Bezos once sold books, which is quite cute, now he sells whatever the f he wants.",
      "You would get an astonishing return on your investment. Which is what motivates you.",
      "Because you sure as hell can’t claim that you genuinely have the interests of the fans at heart? Surely?",
      "In 2017/18, Spurs were better than Liverpool. Since then they’ve won 2 league titles and a champs league. In 2019 Villa were in the championship and Spurs were in the champions league. Now look at them.",

You have had some world class footballers and not built around them. You currently have some footballers who actually seem to care. They’re as angry as the fans. But you have a manager who despite being a nice fella, is a bit of a doughnut. Micky Van der Van does not like or respect Thomas Frank. It’s clear. That isn’t the basis for a successful team.",
      "There is still some lingering gratitude for what you’ve done. Genuinely. The club is in a far far better shape than the one you took over. But your leadership / ownership actually peaked on the last day at White Hart Lane.",

      "Out of the cup and, if reports around their managerial search are to be believed, Manchester United are completely out of ideas.",
      "Darren Fletcher’s two-game spell as the interim-interim manager concluded with the Red Devils’ first ever FA Cup defeat to Brighton. Which sounds stark, but the wrong context in which to view this latest defeat. The Seagulls have now won four of their last five visits to AmEx North. Losing at home to Brighton is just one of those things that Manchester United do.",
      "Not to worry, though, Reds because here comes Ole Gunner Solskjaer and/or Michael Carrick. Just what this situation needs: another blast from the past.",
      "It worked before, right? At least until it didn’t. Solskjaer swept in at the end 2018 and powered by little more than sunshine and smiles, enticed a string of results from a squad that decided it cared little for the standards demanded by Jose Mourinho. Solskjaer lost one game in 17 – even that defeat to PSG provided the platform for a stirring fightback in Paris – which got him the permanent job. The United legend took Mourinho’s team from sixth in December to, at the end of the season…. sixth.",
      "Still, given how tight the Premier League is this season, a similar run now would go a long way to securing a Champions League place. Which Jason Wilcox reckons is achievable. Especially since literally nothing else is.",
      "That may be one reason Wilcox feels that, right now, United need a shot in the arm of nostalgia. More likely, the director of football believes that United fans will be more uncomfortable showing their dissent if one of their own is back at the wheel.",
      "Wilcox, not for the first time, would be wrong. Fletcher’s past glories could not spare him boos at half-time and full-time today from a fan base that isn’t likely to be fooled again by the novelty. The Stretford End have Wilcox and Sir Jim Ratcliffe in their sights and no one on United’s roll of honour will serve as a human shield big enough to spare them the flak.",
      "They will do it anyway, because what else can they do? Few would back the United brains trust to find a suitable manager in the six months between now and the summer. In a week? No chance.",
      "There is an important difference too which Wilcox may well have missed: this group is not as good as the group Solskjaer inherited from Mourinho.",
      "A few months before Mourinho lost the dressing room, he drove them to a runners-up finish in the Premier League. As they showed under Solskjaer, when the whim took them, that squad could play.",
      "This one, by any measure, is not a very good team. For a long time it was believed that they were being held back by Ruben Amorim and his weird devotion to a system that was never going to work at Old Trafford. And that was certainly a factor. But as we’ve seen in the week since the Portuguese was axed, a change of shape cannot compensate for an inability to consistently get the basics right.",
      "This Manchester United is a moments team. For good and bad. And the bad will always render the good a wasted effort.",
      "We saw it before 15 minutes had ticked over at Old Trafford. In the Brighton box, United created a couple of big chances, one for Diogo Dalot and another Benjamin Sesko, that were struck straight at Jason Steele, one of six changes made by Fabian Hurzeler to United’s three. This was hardly the Seagulls’ stiffs, but still.",
      "Defensively, United allowed Brighton the freedom of their box to take the lead. Fault could be found across the back four for not getting close enough to avert danger, or even sniff it. It is a recurring problem among these United players: the lack of willingness or capability to deny opponents space, perhaps assuming that everyone else is as wasteful as they are.",
      "Confidence is low, sure, and that will be a factor in the attacking flaws. Defensively, though, the easiest way to take encouragement is by winning duels and battles. United too often take the approach that you can’t lose the ones you don’t enter.",
      "We have heard lots on United’s ‘DNA’ this week, a concept so loose that no one can really define it. Indisputably, it features youth, and one of the few wins this week were the cameos of Shea Lacey. But he and United even managed to turn that into an L.",
      "United’s support urged the players to find Lacey on the right after the 18-year-old replaced Mason Mount and, always eager to shirk responsibility, his senior team-mates were happy to oblige. Lacey again went close to a first senior goal before he showed that the self-sabotage streak runs down from the first-team to the academy.",
      "A poor tackle earned him his first caution on 87 minutes and, two minutes later, he reacted angrily to another foul given against him, slamming the ball to the floor. United may wish that Simon Hooper took a more lenient view, but what else could the official have done? In the modern game, it is as clear a caution as you can see.",
      "Of course, it won’t be held against the kid and nor should it be. Pre-match, Fletcher was talking about JJ Gabriel a 15-year-old also tearing it up in the youth teams. But there is no saviour coming though the ranks no mater how hard United cling to that particular comfort blanket.",
      "Instead, Wilcox will probably choose to let Solskjaer, United’s emotional support dog, run free in the hope of boosting morale at Old Trafford. But vibes won’t fix this United.",
      "A club so big cannot possibly write off the rest of the season. But they almost already have. Each action and every game between now and May will just be a box ticked before yet another great summer reset, led by men who have proved hopelessly incapable of even recognising one.",
      "‘Darren Fletcher has emerged as one of the big winners from a week of turmoil at Old Trafford’. Has he though?",
      "Manchester United will play the bare minimum number of games in their shortest season in 111 years. They might as well just go and appoint Roy Hodgson.",
      "Darren Fletcher was unable to part the dark clouds above Old Trafford, but the interim-interim manager has achieved some little victories, if no actual wins…",

Caulker entered the pitch in the 90th minute with Liverpool 4-3 up before the true carnage unfolded. Sebastien Bassong equalised before Lallana’s bouncing volley won it for the Reds.",
      "That was Caulker’s final Premier League appearance for the club. All three of his league games in red came within the space of ten days.",
      "A week later, he played his final match for Liverpool: a 0-0 draw against West Ham in the FA Cup. He did not make the squad for the replay, when Liverpool were knocked out in extra time.",
      "Caulker’s time at Anfield is one fans look back on fondly, mainly because it is genuinely quite amusing.",
      "",
      "Signing a 25-year-old Barcelona midfielder on loan sounds like smart business, but Arsenal ultimately paid the Catalan club over £2m to use their player a handful of times before he returned to Spain, later leaving the Nou Camp for Celta Vigo for around £11m.",
      "Suarez played 67 minutes in the Premier League across four matches. His debut came against Manchester City, essentially completing a bleep test for his half-hour on the pitch. The score was 3-1 when he came on and remained so, with little happening after Sergio Aguero completed his hat-trick in the 61st minute.",
      "The Spaniard won four matches and lost two at Arsenal, doing very little in wins over Huddersfield, BATE Borisov, Bournemouth and Manchester United. He did, mind, play 16 minutes in the embarrassing first-leg Europa League knockout defeat to BATE.",
      "When Suarez joined, then-Arsenal boss Unai Emery praised his versatility. In fairness, the midfielder was used in three different positions, right, left and centrally. All pretty pointlessly.",
      "Unfortunately for both club and player, Suarez picked up an injury and missed Arsenal’s final ten competitive matches of the season. He had won the Europa League in 2015 with Emery at Sevilla and was perhaps brought in as nothing more than a good-luck charm. Maybe his presence on the bench would have changed the outcome of the final against Chelsea?",

      "More disastrous than pointless, there was excitement when the USA international arrived from Juventus for the second half of 2022/23 as Leeds sought to swerve relegation once again. McKennie, however, made no impact at Elland Road, certainly no positive one.",
      "It didn’t help that Jesse Marsch, the manager McKennie signed to play for, was sacked a week after his arrival.",
      "McKennie made 19 Premier League appearances and registered just one assist. “I didn’t have the best performances. I felt I let certain people down,” he later admitted.",
      "He couldn’t wait to get away. After being serenaded with chants of “you fat b*****d!” by Leeds fans upon his withdrawal on the hour in the final match of the season – a 4-1 defeat to Spurs that sealed relegation – McKennie made a dash for the train station with a one-way ticket.",
      "Frustratingly for Leeds, the 27-year-old is now doing very well back at Juventus.",
      "",
      "When Macheda burst onto the scene with his winning goal against Aston Villa, it felt like Manchester United had done it again – another wonderkid ready to take the world by storm.",
      "It didn’t quite work out that way.",
      "United may not have won the league in 2009 without Macheda’s goals in consecutive matches. He was rewarded the following season with nine first-team appearances. Things didn’t improve in 2010/11, and he was loaned to Sampdoria, scoring zero goals in 14 Serie A matches.",
      "The following season felt like his last chance. A January loan to QPR offered regular Premier League football, or so it seemed. He played three league games and three FA Cup matches, scored no goals, and returned to United early due to injury.",
      "As loan spells go, it doesn’t get much worse.",
      "Macheda is now playing for Asteras Tripolis in Greece, the Italian forward is 34 years old.",
      "",
      "Remarkably, Goram was substituted in both of his appearances for United, which must be some sort of record for a goalkeeper.",
      "He joined in January from Motherwell – who were reportedly set to release him – and was sadly a shadow of his former self.",
      "Goram made his name at Rangers, earning the nickname “The Goalie” while winning five league titles, two Scottish League Cups and three Scottish Cups. Technically, he added a Premier League winner’s medal during his half-season at Old Trafford.",
      "In reality, he made just two appearances. He lasted 66 minutes on his debut against Coventry City after picking up a Jaap Stam backpass, then failed to reach the hour mark against Southampton a month later.",
      "He was an unused substitute on the final day against Tottenham and did not feature in any of United’s six Champions League matches, two FA Cup ties or 14 of their 17 league games.",
      "To make things even better, he did not get on with club captain Roy Keane. Because…Roy Keane",
      "",
      "A player who never lived up to his incredible potential, Pato arrived in the Premier League in 2015/16 after Chelsea signed him on loan from Corinthians.",
      "He wasn’t fit when he arrived and had to wait until April to make his debut against Aston Villa. He scored at Villa Park, making it one goal from one appearance. He then played roughly an hour in the next match – a 1-0 defeat at Swansea – and that was near enough it.",
      "Signing a player on loan only to have him sit on the bench for 99% of his spell is baffling. Perhaps Chelsea were trying to boost their popularity in Brazil?",
      "Since his completely pointless time in west London, Pato has played in Brazil, Spain, China, the USA and is now back in Brazil with Sao Paulo.",

      "Manchester United captain Bruno Fernandes will reportedly ‘seek a fresh start’ after the 2026 World Cup, with the Portuguese international’s team-mates believing his mind is already made up.",
      "Fernandes admitted he was “hurt” and “sad” that the Red Devils considered selling him last summer and could now look for pastures new following the sacking of Ruben Amorim.",
      "Amorim had convinced Fernandes to stay at Old Trafford after the club’s hierarchy considered cashing in on the midfielder amid interest from Saudi Arabia.",
      "“From the club I felt it was, ‘If you go it’s not so bad for us’,” the United captain said.",
      "“That hurts me a bit… I think they didn’t have the courage to make that decision as the manager wanted me.”",
      "United ultimately opted to keep Fernandes despite a potential £100million sale, but their willingness to sell – coupled with Amorim’s departure – has reportedly left the captain disillusioned, with an exit now viewed as increasingly likely.",
      "According to The Sun, Fernandes’ United team-mates ‘fear’ their captain is ‘tired of all the turmoil’ and will leave the club after this summer’s World Cup.",
      "Fernandes has previously stated that he will not focus on his future at the Premier League champions until after Portugal’s campaign in North America, but the report claims players believe he will ‘seek a fresh start’.",
      "A source told the newspaper: “Some of the squad think Bruno has had enough and, to be honest, they don’t blame him.",
      "“He always gives 100 per cent and has been the club’s best player since he joined.",
      "“But they think that he feels let down under the new ownership model and Amorim leaving has not helped. He isn’t a likely candidate for a big-money move to Saudi because he’s a football purist.",

      "Manchester United have “closed the door” on exits after the sacking of Ruben Amorim, according to Roma chief Frederic Massara, who feels it’s “unlikely” a move will happen for a United star now.",
      "There are a few United players who would probably benefit from exits, at least on loan, in January. The pair who spring to mind first are Joshua Zirkzee and Kobbie Mainoo, whose roles under Amorim were very limited.",
      "Both have been courted by clubs in the build up to the January window opening, and Roma are the side who were pushing hardest to land Zirkzee.",
      "That push has been ongoing up until recent days, when the sacking of Amorim seems to have thrown things into the air.",
      "Indeed, Roma chief Massara has now said: “Zirkzee? Right now, United have closed off all transfer discussions; it seems highly unlikely to me.”",
      "While Amorim might have been content with Zirkzee leaving the club, whoever follows him through the door might not feel the same way.",
      "United would not want to put a new boss under masses of pressure by leaving him short in one of the more important areas of the pitch.",
      "Currently, Zirkzee is one of only two players capable of playing as the central striker, with Bryan Mbeumo at the African Cup of Nations, though he will soon return after Cameroon were knocked out.",
      "In any case, Mbeumo has been preferred in a wide role at United so far, and No.9 Benjamin Sesko has failed to convince for the most part.",
      "With that said, he scored a brace in the 2-2 draw with Burnley in the week, though those were just his third and fourth goals in a United shirt, and his first since early October.",
      "As such, whoever takes charge of the Red Devils next will surely want to have another option to push Sesko and potentially perform when the Slovenian international isn’t.",
      "There are multiple varying reports suggesting who might be the next United manager. Some outlets have suggested that there is progress being made for Ole Gunnar Solskjaer to return in an interim capacity.",
      "Crystal Palace manager Oliver Glasner is then said to be the ‘heavy favourite’ to take charge in the summer, but his side crashing out of the FA Cup might not help the optics of that move.",
      "The holders were bundled out by National League North club Macclesfield, the first time the holders have been out by a non-league club since 1909.",
      "Manchester United striker Joshua Zirkzee is still on the radar of Roma, according to Fabrizio Romano, who said a January move could be on the cards.\nThe 24-year-old Dutchman only…",
      "The new Man Utd boss will have the “final decision” on Joshua Zirkzee’s future as Fabrizio Romano reveals Ole Gunnar Solskjaer is the “leading candidate”.",
      "Man Utd could reportedly have the chance to do a swap deal involving Joshua Zirkzee and a Roma player as the Serie A side look to speed up the transfer.",
      "Joshua Zirkzee is at breaking point with Man Utd boss Ruben Amorim looking to sell him ahead of the January transfer window, according to reports.",
      "Man Utd legend Gary Neville has hit out at the Red Devils for the “baddest of the bad” display against Wolves as he criticised Ruben Amorim’s substitutions.",
      "According to Fabrizio Romano, Manchester United could make two signings in January as they would “only” let Joshua Zirkzee leave on one condition."

      "United are now one of only three Premier League teams who just have top-flight football on their calendar between now and May, the others being Bournemouth and Everton. Even the bottom five teams in the division still have a chance of a trophy this season. United's silverware ship has sailed.",
      "There is still a Champions League place up for grabs, with the club three points behind fourth place in a race that even could see fifth place qualify - and interim head coach Darren Fletcher believes this team can qualify for Europe's top table next season.",
      "\"That can be achieved this season,\" said Fletcher. \"It's not what fans want to hear about Manchester United. They should be winning cups and challenging for the Premier League.",
      "\"That is where we're at. We have to face that and deal with that. It's not Manchester United level and what's expected. But we have to do something about that. We have to take a step forward by qualifying for the Champions League, which is important for a number of reasons.",
      "\"The players have to step up. They will come together. I challenge them to do that, they have enough quality and leaders to do that.",
      "\"Don't waste the season, that is the challenge I would set.\"",
      "Champions League football from here would represent success for United - it wouldn't for the old version of United that we used to know but it absolutely would for this current standard of the club. But even then, there are a few problems in the way of that goal.",
      "United's next two games - which follow this latest blow - are against the two best teams in the country. Manchester City come to Old Trafford next. It's a difficult challenge anyway, but it's even harder when nobody inside the club knows who will take the team for that game.",
      "Come the end of Arsenal away, the game after the Manchester derby, United could be nine points adrift of the top four. United could, of course, take points from both fixtures. But given where they are right now and Fletcher calling them a \"fragile\" team, two defeats are very possible.",
      "Another problem is: can this United team be really backed to qualify for the Champions League?",
      "The Opta supercomputer gives them a 4.9 per cent chance of reaching that goal come May. Right now, four teams are statistically better placed than United to finish in the top four. That includes fifth-placed Brentford, who Opta believe have twice as much of a chance than United of getting there.",
      "With Keith Andrews' side being a club completely aligned top to bottom, making transfers to improve the squad, possessing excellent home form and a striker on course for over 30 goals for the campaign, how do you argue against that logic when United have the opposite of all of them?",
      "United are currently predicted to finish eighth, 10 points off the Champions League places, which may not even be enough for European football. The prospect of Sir Jim Ratcliffe and INEOS' two full seasons at the club ending in back-to-back trophyless campaigns and no European football is a more than realistic possibility.",
      "No wonder there was a banner claiming Ratcliffe is unable to fix the current situation - and a protest planned for the upcoming Fulham game about the current ownership structure being unfit for purpose.",
      "Like at full-time against Brighton on Sunday, United fans have little to shout about between now and May. Perhaps the silver lining for them is - with 17 games of the season to go - they don't have to put themselves through the mill for much longer."

Benjamin Sesko headed home Fernandes' corner to bring some hope, but United's day got worse with 18-year-old Lacey receiving two quick yellows in succession, the second for dissent, as a late equaliser evaded them.",

      "As Manchester United look to their past once again, Adam Bate reports from Turf Moor after Darren Fletcher's first game in interim charge and argues that trying to recreate what's been lost since Sir Alex Ferguson's retirement is not the way forward",
      "Monday 12 January 2026 08:53, UK",
      "They chanted for Darren Fletcher. They chanted for Ole Gunnar Solskjaer. They chanted for Michael Carrick. Under the lights at Turf Moor, they played four at the back and saw an academy-graduate winger come close to scoring a stunning winner.",
      "Squint a little and Manchester United's players and supporters were beginning to enjoy themselves again even if Jason Wilcox and Omar Berrada did appear rather stoney-faced in the stands. Kobbie Mainoo and Mason Mount as the midfield two. Thirty shots.",
      "The stories are already doing the rounds about how Fletcher has inspired the young players at Old Trafford by showing them videos of Ronaldo and Wayne Rooney. We have been here before, of course, when Solskjaer had a tale for every situation. Fans lap it up.",
      "None of which should really convince United's decision-makers to lurch back to the past for any great length of time. As difficult as it might be after a painful - and now largely pointless - misstep under Ruben Amorim, United still need to look to the future.",
      "Nostalgia is a powerful emotion when you have won the lot but despite the subsequent line in the song claiming that it is never going to stop, United are stuck once again. This can feel like a football club that is happier looking backwards rather than forwards.",
      "For now, every match - every conversation around that match - has become a referendum on this club's path back to glory. United are at another fork in that road. Many seem tired of the attempts to modernise by mimicry. They want to do it their way.",
      "Gary Neville is determined to see the club embrace their DNA and start 'playing the United way' again. Paul Parker thinks that means bringing back Roy Keane. And that is just the former England right-backs. Viv Anderson's views on the matter are unclear.",
      "Then there are the ginger ex-midfielders. Paul Scholes believes Keane's return would be greeted rapturously, comparing it to Cristiano Ronaldo's playing return - which was obviously a huge success. Nicky Butt thinks there needs to be a role for Steve Bruce.",
      "Rio Ferdinand is pleased that Fletcher has been appointed as interim coach - revealing that the former players' WhatsApp group agrees - and is even more delighted that Sir Alex Ferguson was consulted by his compatriot before taking on this temporary role.",
      "The devotion to the cult of Ferguson might seem like harmless deference to an octogenarian legend but it hints at a longing for what is long gone that retains a material influence on what must happen next. United are still searching for that secret sauce.",
      "Perhaps it is to be expected given Ferguson's outsized importance at a club of United's vast stature. Arguably England's biggest club and certainly its best supported, they have nevertheless only won the title under two men since the First World War.",
      "For context, that is the same number as Burnley. It is fewer than the number of different managers who took Chelsea to the Premier League title over a seven-year period in the 2010s. Manchester City managed to win it under three different men in just six years.",
      "The culture at United is different and it is natural that Ferguson's former players look for lessons from their old guru, even if Solskjaer's infamous claim that he did not feel comfortable using his parking space at the training ground was rather stretching it.",
      "The challenge is that replicating him is not quite as easy as instituting the possession principles drilled into kids at Barcelona's La Masia or Ajax's De Toekomst. Ferguson was more malleable, his ideas a moveable feast that shifted to the game's requirements.",
      "The unfortunate truth is that there is no Ferguson coaching school, no thread of an idea passed down to the next generation, just the gut feeling of a great manager. One who showed throughout his long and successful career that he could adapt to the times.",
      "What would Ferguson do now? We do not know. Most likely, it would look as different as Norman Whiteside did to Carlos Tevez, as different as his Aberdeen team to his late-era United, not some facsimile of a system adopted when John Major was in power.",
      "Fresh concepts came via an ever evolving cast of assistants. He played with strike pairings until he didn't. He played 4-4-2 until he didn't. He played open and attacking football until Champions League success demanded a different approach away from home.",
      "The myth at the heart of all this is the idea that Sir Matt Busby and Sir Alex are and were United incarnate, the products of some immaculate conception at The Cliff, rather than the outsiders they were. Both Scots, Busby even played for Man City and Liverpool.",
      "Indeed, Liverpool went through all this too, dragging Sir Kenny Dalglish out of retirement when they lost their way under Roy Hodgson, the title never seeming so far from view. It took the arrival of a man with no ties whatsoever to the city to deliver that prize.",
      "Speaking of Jurgen Klopp, one recalls an awkward conversation with Borussia Dortmund chief Carsten Cramer when it was pointed out that for all his talk of the need for what he likes to call 'Dortmund guys', it was Klopp, a Swabian, who won their last title.",
      "And yet, still the idea is seductive, a comfort to these clubs scrambling to recapture something lost. How else to explain turning to a man sacked by Middlesbrough in June or a man last at Besiktas who was sacked by Manchester United themselves in 2021.",
      "This is familiar ground for both, of course, Carrick and Solskjaer each having stepped in to steady the ailing ship before. Ryan Giggs did so before them. Ruud van Nistelrooy has done so since. Fletcher now joins that list as United try again to work out what comes next.",
      "But this is stasis not progress and it cannot be presented as some great restoration plan destined to Make United Great Again. It is the absence of an idea rather than a return to one, a club so weighed down by its own history that it gives up forging a new future.",
      "By all means, play positive football with a back four and try to bring through young players. This is hardly unique and it is the aim of most clubs in the country, funnily enough. As with Busby and Ferguson, you do not need to be steeped in United's traditions to do it.",
      "That should be obvious. But when you are Manchester United and have won the lot under one man, the temptation to look back can be irresistible. Solskjaer at the wheel? Meet the new boss, same as the old boss. Squint a little and it might even start to make sense.",

      "Had Shea Lacey's late strike found the net rather than the frame of the goal, it would have been one of those magical Manchester United moments. A young player who the supporters had wanted Ruben Amorim to trust with more minutes proving the hero.",
      "That Lacey was on the pitch at all was a product of more than Darren Fletcher's desire to lean into United's youth legacy but an attacking switch that saw United finish the game with Burnley at Turf Moor with a midfield duo of Kobbie Mainoo and Mason Mount.",
      "The away support appreciated it, chanting Fletcher's name as well as that of Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and Michael Carrick - two men touted with a return. But United need more than mere sentiment right now, they are chasing Champions League football.",
      "Games against Wolves, Leeds and Burnley have not yielded a single victory. They have now contrived to drop points to all of the bottom seven teams in the table since November. Even five points from the last three games would have United in the top four.",

      "Those nights at the Gtech playing through the likes of Liverpool and Manchester City and putting four past Manchester United feel a world away.",
      "Brentford scored more goals in open play than Chelsea last season. They were the fifth-highest scorers overall and produced 1.5xG fewer than Arsenal across the course of the campaign.",
      "But at a side with resources he could have only dreamt of 12 months ago, he has overseen relative drops in every single attacking metric.",
      "His old Brentford side was crafted with Matthew Benham's superbly honed data-driven system with a hit rate for finding hidden gems to rival any Premier League scouting department.",
      "He does not have that tailor-made side at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, but that does not mount anything like a sufficient excuse for the insipid football he has served up in his first six months.",
      "With results and style so poor, it's inevitable the pressure is ramping up around Frank. He must find a way to change things and fast before it is taken out of his hands.Ron Walker",
      "It's been a tough start to 2026 for Man City.",
      "They are without a win so far this year and they've been hit with injuries to key players. Central defenders Josko Gvardiol and Ruben Dias and winger Savinho have sufferred significant injuries. John Stones is also on the sidelines too as City were forced to field an unfamiliar pair at the back in 21-year-old Abdukodir Khusanov and debutant Max Alleyne.",
      "And while Brighton did spurn some really good early chances, it wasn't City's makeshift defence that cost them victory at the Etihad.",
      "Pep Guardiola bemoaned the chances his side wasted, not only against Brighton, but also in the draws against Sunderland and Chelsea.",
      "Guardiola said: \"The result is the result. I'm not a person who believes what we have done isn't fair. One point for them, one point for us. That is what it is. I love a lot the way we played, we did many good things, but we don't score goals. There are too many clear chances. It is not just one or two players, it is all the players up front who create a lot. Unfortunately we couldn't score and scoring goals is part of the job. That is the reason why we could not win the games.\"",
      "After the game, Guardiola refused to confirm City were on the brink of signing Antoine Semenyo, who is expected to undergo a medical on Thursday after City reportedly agreed to meet the Ghana international's £65m release clause, but maybe a third successive draw underlines Guardiola's need for the Bournemouth winger's creativity.Oliver Yew",
      "Newcastle's meeting with Leeds might have gone down as a classic even without the 102nd-minute Harvey Barnes goal that tilted it the way of the hosts. With the Bruno Guimaraes penalty in the 91st minute, Newcastle had already come from behind three times for the first time in the league since 1996. It felt dramatic enough.",
      "But with that swing of his right boot, surrounded by blue-shirted defenders, Barnes secured its place in history. He described it as a \"blur\" after the game and it was a similar experience for those watching. A breathless encounter throughout.",
      "It was a heart-breaking outcome for Leeds, who took a deserved lead through Brenden Aaronson's superb first-half strike and kept putting their noses back in front. Their brave performance, at a ground were so many teams struggle, deserves acclaim.",

      "Afterwards, caretaker boss Calum McFarlane argued the sending off was not an example of ill-discipline but admitted the flurry of yellow cards which followed it could be looked at.",
      "But while Rosenior has spoken about his desire for intensity from his team, Chelsea have crossed the line too many times this season. And it's costing them. This is the third Premier League game Chelsea have lost after seeing a player sent off and that's before the impact of suspensions through reds and accumulated yellows is analysed.Peter Smith",

      "Silva reckons this is Wilson's \"best moment\" of his career and it's hard to argue. Of course there have been other standout moments for him in a Fulham shirt but Silva noted how the pair had a conversation last season to help try to draw out these kind of consistently impactful performances.",

      "But Forest kept their cool and crucially made the most of the two big moments that went their way. Dyche's side recognised the lucky escape they had when West Ham's second goal was ruled out for offside at the start of the second half and went on the attack.",
      "Nicolas Dominguez's header soon brought them level before VAR intervened again and gave Morgan Gibbs-White the chance to complete the turnaround from the penalty spot.",

      "Fans wondered who would fill the void left by Ivan Toney. Bryan Mbeumo and Yoane Wissa stepped up.",
      "When those two left, it was left to Igor Thiago to step up. Having had his early Brentford career derailed with a serious injury, all the eggs were placed into his basket. And what a decision that was.",
      "Five goals in his last two games including a double against Sunderland, has seen the Brazilian write himself into Premier League folklore. His 16 Premier League goals this season is more than any other player from the country has managed previously.",
      "Bearing in mind that it is still the beginning of January, that is some feat for a player who must be thinking about earning a place at the table for the World Cup come the summer.",
      "More importantly for Brentford fans, his goals may leave them sat at the table of European contenders next season, something they wouldn’t have even dreamed of when the inexperienced Keith Andrews replaced the beloved Thomas Frank. He certainly has stepped into the spotlight without a hitch.",
      "All these changes for the Bees in the summer seemed to spell doom. But, football is a funny game, and it has ended up being another boom instead.",
      "When it comes to Panenka penalties, there's a fine line between audacious brilliance and awful execution.",
      "Which side of that line a player falls on ultimately depends on one thing - whether the ball ends up in the back of the net.",
      "A missed penalty is bad, yet a curious rule of this beautiful game we love dictates that a missed Panenka is orders of magnitude worse.",
      "In the case of Sunderland's Enzo Le Fee, not only did he miss a penalty, he compounded it with a Panenka, which happened to be one of the worst seen in the Premier League for some time.",
      "There is a time and place for Panenka - and this wasn't it. Ideally, they should be taken from a position of strength and not, say, when your team is fighting for a second‑half equaliser after being outplayed in the first period.",
      "Yet when tasked with cancelling out Igor Thiago's opener and hauling Sunderland level at the Gtech Community Stadium, Le Fee decided that was the opportune moment to whip it out.",
      "The penalty barely served as catching practice for goalkeeper Caoimhín Kelleher, who nonchalantly gathered to halt Sunderland's second‑half momentum, before Thiago's second and Ehor Yarmoliuk's third extinguished their challenge.Jack Wilkinson",
      "\"I'm not scared of anyone,\"",
      "That's what Mateus Mane said after he scored his second in as many games to rescue a point for Wolves at Everton.",
      "At just 18, he's the light that Wolves have needed in what has been a dark campaign.",
      "His maturity on the ball, whether in decision-making or looking after possession, is that of a forward well beyond his years. His composure was on full display as he took a deft touch to set himself and stroke home his side's leveller.",
      "Liverpool, Old Trafford and now Everton's Hill Dickinson, the England youth international is building a portfolio of impressive displays.",
      "Still just a teenager but it looks like whatever fate lies ahead of Wolves for the rest of this season, the next five months will be silver-lined by Mane.William Bitibiri",
      "Burnley have spent most of this season searching for something, anything, to break their way. Against Manchester United, they finally found it.",
      "This was not a performance built on dominance or territorial control. Far from it. Burnley lost the expected goals battle 0.24 to 2.25, were outshot 30 to seven and managed just nine touches in the Manchester United penalty box across the 90 minutes. Those numbers usually tell a blunt story. Usually they spell defeat.",
      "Instead, they walked off with a 2-2 draw and a sense that maybe the season hasn't completely slipped through their fingers.",
      "Burnley are now 12 matches without a win, a sequence that speaks volumes about the brutal learning curve of life back in the Premier League.",
      "They were outplayed. They were outshot. They were out-chanced. And yet they survived. It is something to build on.Lewis Jones",
      "It was a tale of two halves on the pitch and a tale of two very different moods from the managers in the press conference.",
      "Unai Emery, still seething VAR did not look at a late penalty claim for his side, insisted there were positives to take following the draw. But the frustration in his body language was clear to see.",
      "Villa could have moved clear of Manchester City in second with a win, although it likely would have been undeserved.",
      "Instead, they dropped points to Crystal Palace yet again. If Oliver Glasner could bottle up what he has over his counterpart when they face off against each other, managers across the Premier League would be queuing up.",
      "In the red and blue corner, Glasner was bubbling in his press conference.",
      "His side are in a tough period but despite injuries and absences due to AFCON, as well as transfer rumours surrounding captain Marc Guehi bubbling away, his side battled well and arguably should've come away with more.",
      "Football is unpredictable at the best of times but Palace causing problems and frustration for Villa now seems inevitable.Pat Rowe",

      "Darren Fletcher's first game in charge against Burnley has meant a temporary halt to the active talks with candidates as everyone at the club focuses on that match, but I'd expect things to accelerate towards the back end of this week.",
      "Jason Wilcox, the club's director of football, was key in the decision to sack Ruben Amorim, and is leading the search for his successor - both in the short and the long term.",
      "So far, he has held only informal talks with a number of candidates, including the two primary targets for an interim role, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and Michael Carrick. Much has yet to be decided about:",
      "It is clear that United prefer the idea of appointing an interim coaching team for the remainder of this season, to allow a more thorough process of due diligence on the greater number of big names who are more likely to be available in the summer (think Oliver Glasner, Marco Silva, Andoni Iraola, Thomas Tuchel, Mauricio Pochettino, Julian Nagelsmann and Roberto De Zerbi). But the timing of when that interim takes charge is a vital and difficult decision.",
      "While other top clubs might consider playing a changed team in this weekend's FA Cup third round to prioritise their Premier League campaigns, the competition is really important for Manchester United - who host Brighton on Sunday.",
      "For a start, it is their only realistic chance of silverware, and a route into European football next season. But it is also the only other competition they are involved with.",
      "United's elite players are attuned to a hectic schedule of perennial weekend and mid-week matches. When the fixture calendar is much more sparse than that, it can be discombobulating.",
      "The extra games United would gain from a cup run could prove very important for the rest of their season, as the new head coach (or coaches) try to bed-in their tactical system, and also get some much-needed game-time for the wider squad.",
      "If it is Solskjaer who takes over, his first spell in charge in 2021 saw him predominantly go with a 4-2-3-1 formation, which this current United squad has - famously - rarely used.",
      "Finding successful partnerships in the new system, working out which players are best in which positions, maybe re-integrating Kobbie Mainoo into the starting XI - all those things would be easier with the extra matches a cup run would bring.",
      "So, Sunday is not a game that United can take lightly. And part of their decision about the coaching quandary will be dictated by what is best for the team at that stage.",
      "Is it best to leave Fletcher in charge at Old Trafford for the tie, or better to bring the new man (or men) in at the first opportunity? A thorough assessment of the game against Burnley will be required.",
      "In the background, of course, is the much more significant process of deciding who should be the head coach going forward.",
      "After paying around £10m in severance to Amorim and his staff, United will again want to try to avoid a big compensation bill for whomever they employ next.",
      "That is at least part of their thinking about why it is best to kick the can down the road, and postpone the big appointment until the summer.",

      "Man Utd had a number of players facing an uncertain future before Ruben Amorim's sacking and the change in the dugout raises the prospect of potentially more upheaval while also opening the door for others to fight their way back into the first-team picture at Old Trafford",
      "By Dan Khan & Zinny Boswell",
      "Wednesday 7 January 2026 14:36, UK",
      "Change is afoot at Manchester United after the sacking of Ruben Amorim - but what does it mean for their high-profile players? Here we assess what the future may hold for Kobbie Mainoo, Bruno Fernandes and Marcus Rashford among others.",
      "Few players are expected to be impacted by the exit of Amorim quite as much as the 20-year-old midfielder, who has been on the fringes this season and frustrated with his role under the departed head coach.",
      "Mainoo is one of the few players in the squad yet to start a league game this season and he faced an uncertain future at United because of Amorim's refusal to give him a chance which has been a challenging situation for a player so early in their career.",
      "The academy graduate asked to leave on loan in the summer in search of more playing time ahead of the World Cup but has never communicated a desire for a permanent exit which suggests he wants to stay and fight for his Old Trafford career.",
      "United have no intention of letting Mainoo leave - on loan or in a permanent deal - because there is a widespread desire for him to stay at the club and keep improving. Before Amorim arrived, Mainoo was a key player and scored in the FA Cup final win over Man City.",
      "Amorim insisted he rated Mainoo and put his struggle for minutes down to him competing with captain Bruno Fernandes to play as the more advanced of the two central midfielders in his 3-4-3 formation.",
      "The hope for many fans will be that common sense prevails, and Mainoo is restored to the midfield once he returns from injury. All the noises suggest both player and club want to continue together as long as he gets adequate game-time.",
      "Surely whoever takes over will not persist with the same shape quite so stubbornly as Amorim, which should in theory open the door for Mainoo to reinstate himself in the team. Then it will be up to him to perform.",
      "Amorim was also essentially the driving force behind convincing Fernandes to stay at United in the summer when Al Hilal tried to sign him. The Portuguese has also since revealed he was hurt by the club hierarchy's handling of that situation in the summer.",
      "In an interview with Portuguese media in November, Fernandes said he felt the club bosses wanted to cash in on him but lacked the courage to defy Amorim.",
      "That tallies with what Fernandes told British media in October, but nonetheless the decision to air his unhappiness with his employers so publicly raises questions about the state of their relationship.",
      "If Fernandes still feels unwanted or underappreciated come summer and another offer like the one from Al Hilal materialises there are no guarantees Amorim's successor will have the same ability or desire to convince the captain to stay.",
      "The Portugal international has said he will not talk to anyone about his future until after this summer's World Cup. By then United will hope to have a new permanent head coach. That appointment could be decisive for Fernandes' future.",
      "The 31-year-old's contract at United expires in 2027 and includes the option of an additional year. Fernandes has shown no signs of slowing down in his 30s but clubs tend to be more reluctant to offer long-term extensions to players of his age.",
      "The England international has revived his career on loan at Barcelona this season under Hansi Flick after Amorim exiled him at Old Trafford. That loan agreement includes an option for the Spanish club to sign Rashford for £26m but it remains to be seen if they will use it.",
      "Barcelona are delighted with Rashford's performances but are unlikely to discuss a permanent move until the summer. They still have financial problems and have to consider if the money is there to keep paying his wages in their entirety as well as the transfer fee.",
      "Rashford's future at Barcelona also hinges on what happens to 37-year-old striker Robert Lewandowski at the end of the season when his deal expires. The England forward's ability to play as a No 9 could come into the club's thinking around keeping him.",
      "Despite having more than two years left on his contract, Rashford remains unlikely to have any future at United. It remains to be seen how the player or club bosses might react if the next permanent head coach wanted Rashford back at Old Trafford.",
      "Everything seems to rest on Barcelona. United will hope they don't have to find the forward a new club once the summer transfer window opens with very few sides able to afford his reported £325,000-a-week salary.",
      "Roma are interested in the Netherlands international and have been preparing a proposal to take him on loan with an option to buy this summer but Sky in Italy are reporting that the change in the dugout at Old Trafford has slowed things down.",
      "Any decision over potential exits are expected to be pushed back until United make a decision over the head coach position - whether it be a permanent replacement or an interim until the end of the season - to let them evaluate the squad.",
      "Zirkzee struggled for game-time under Amorim this season and only regained his place in the team due to players being unavailable because of AFCON or due to injury but has remained patient and is seen as a positive influence in the changing room.",
      "Amorim's view that Zirkzee is more suited to being a No 10 than a striker has been one of the key reasons behind his struggles to get into the team with so much competition for those positions.",
      "If the interim head coach sees things differently that could open the door for Zirkzee to play more with Benjamin Sesko, the only out-and-out striker in the squad at Old Trafford, who is yet to nail down that position after a slow start.",
      "The Brazilian became one of Amorim's most trusted players after initially being dropped from the team entirely and with his contract up in the summer there is a lot of uncertainty surrounding his future.",
      "United do not plan to trigger the one-year option in Casemiro's contract because his wages are too high and do not fit into the structure they are trying to implement at Old Trafford.",
      "However, given his importance to Amorim there may have been more of a desire to find a solution and renegotiate his terms if the Portuguese had not been sacked. As things stand, there have been no fresh talks over a new contract.",
      "United's priority this summer is signing at least one top midfielder which is expected to push Casemiro down the pecking order at United and it remains to be seen how happy the 33-year-old would be to stick around to play less and earn less.",
      "Another big factor will be the view of the new permanent head coach on Casemrio. If nothing is agreed until the summer, the timing could see the Brazilian depart as a free agent before Amorim's successor even has a chance to make a call.",
      "Amorim's arrival was supposed to be good news for the Uruguayan given his success working with the Portuguese at Sporting, however it never worked out like that.",
      "Ugarte never regained the trust of his old head coach at Old Trafford and remains a peripheral figure. If things don't turn around for the 24-year-old under the interim in the second half of the campaign, he will have had two disappointing seasons at the club.",
      "That would put his future in further doubt with plenty of speculation already linking him with a potential move to Turkey in January.",
      "With so much upheaval at United this month, there is a realistic chance that Ugarte will get one more chance to prove himself, but it does feel as though time is running out for him.",
      "The 32-year-old centre-back is out of contract in the summer and so far there has been no clarity around what the future holds for him.",
      "Injuries have kept Maguire out for much of the season but he continues to show his worth when fit, most obviously with his winner at Anfield in October.",
      "The former United captain's resilience and leadership made him a valuable member of the squad to Amorim - but there is no telling how his successor will view Maguire.",
