      "Kobbie Mainoo has been served a harsh dose of reality as speculation continues around his Manchester United future. The 20-year-old has become one of Old Trafford's most discussed figures this season, despite barely featuring on the pitch.",
      "Mainoo hasn't been given a single Premier League start under Ruben Amorim this term and has only started once across all competitions in a shocking Carabao Cup exit to League Two outfit Grimsby Town back in August. Despite his limited game time, the England international continues to attract attention from European giants Napoli and Bayern Munich, who are reportedly keeping tabs on his situation.",
      "Mainoo even sought a loan switch late in the summer transfer window, raising doubts about his standing in Amorim's plans. The Portuguese manager insisted this week that the youngster remains integral to his vision for the club, even branding him the \"future of Manchester United\".",
      "But former Premier League striker Dean Saunders believes the hype around Mainoo has spiralled beyond what he's actually achieved, whilst questioning whether Amorim truly means what he says.",
      "Speaking on talkSPORT, the ex-Wolves and Wrexham boss said: \"I've never known a player get so much airtime and so much press without kicking a ball. He's in the back pages of the paper every day. Mainoo this, Mainoo that and he hasn't started since Grimsby away in the cup when they got knocked out.",
      "\"They were horrendous against Grimsby and I think sometimes, as a manager, you watch that game and you think, 'that's it, he's never playing again. He [Amorim] has played Fernandes in that role with Casimero and he [Mainoo] has not got the chance to play.",
      "\"It won't go on forever, because he's played for England and he's shown his potential. He scored a couple of good goals, but I don't think he does know that position. He [Amorim] has just gone, 'I've had enough of this every day. Mainoo this, Mainoo that. I'll put it to bed by just saying he's not going anywhere.'\".",
      "The harsh assessment stands in stark contrast to Amorim's public support, after the United manager dismissed any talk of a January departure.",
      "He said: \"He's going to be the future of Manchester United, that is my feeling. He just needs to wait for his chance and everything can change in football in two days.",
      "\"Kobbie Mainoo will have the opportunity he has all the time. He played in different positions; he can do that [defensive midfield] position, he can play if we play with three, he can play like we play in the last game - the position of Mason Mount in this game [against Villa].\"",
      "Amorim subsequently dismissed speculation about Mainoo departing Old Trafford next month, saying: \"If we are not getting someone, it is hard to leave. Even with a full squad we are shorter [in terms of players] for something that can happen here so it's going to be hard for someone to leave the club if we don't get a substitution.\"",
      "However, despite being recently sidelined with a calf injury, there are ongoing queries about why Mainoo hasn't been able to secure a spot in Amorim's starting line-up. Saunders suggests that a short-term loan move overseas could be beneficial for the midfielder, identifying Italy as an ideal place for development.",
      "He added: \"He's shown potential, but this is Man United we're talking about. They're trying to win everything they enter. They're a massive club and in that number six position, you have to smell danger from all angles.",
      "\"I think, for a young lad to learn that, it's difficult unless he's playing every week. I think you're doing good if you go to Napoli or somewhere like that, one of these Italian teams.\"",

      "Ex-Premier League referee Keith Hackett has backed Anthony Taylor's decision not to award Newcastle a penalty for a handball by Manchester United captain Lisandro Martinez.",
      "During the match on Boxing Day, a shot from Fabian Schar hit the stand-in United captain inside the six-yard box. Despite Martinez's claims to referee Taylor, that the ball had struck him in the stomach, replays suggested his arm had made contact with the ball.",
      "Video assistant referee Stuart Attwell reviewed that incident, but decided against any further action. Hackett, who previously served as the general manager of Professional Game Match Officials Limited (PGMOL), has now given his verdict on the contentious decision.",
      "Speaking to Football Insider, Hackett said: \"The referee has to judge if the action by the player is deliberate when deciding that an offence has taken place, not every time the ball comes into contact, is it an offence. There is sufficient doubt in this action not to award a penalty kick.\"",
      "\"Schar hits it, his arm is up above his head, and it's stretched. Is it because he's pushing [Malick] Thiaw?",
      "\"That might just save him. He's actually wrestling with the other Newcastle centre-back; his arms are already there.",
      "\"If Thiaw is nowhere near him, then that's definitely a penalty. I think the fact that he has just had a wrestle with the other centre-back might just save him.\"",
      "Neville also revealed what the VAR officials made of the controversial moment. The pundit added: \"He's saying the context is because there's another situation whereby he's fighting with another player, and his arm's are already up there and he's just not got back down.\"",
      "Main commentator Peter Drury explained: \"They are calling it mutual contact between Martinez and Thiaw. And that's essentially the explanation for the fact that there won't be a penalty.\"",
      "Following United's triumph, head coach Ruben Amorim heaped praise on Martinez. He said: \"I think he's a guy with a lot of character. He's really good on the ball, and that came with the quality that he has.",
      "\"He played [in the] World Cup, he won [the] World Cup. He's used to that stress, and he showed today that he's a top player, and sometimes people talk about the way he defends the box because he's a small guy, but today he did really well against a team that just has tall players.\"",
      "Yet when he was in turn pressed on whether the squad would be stronger with Martinez maintaining his fitness, Amorim declined to single out individuals. He responded: \"No, I don't want to say that because - if we don't have more points - it's because of the team, not because of a specific player.\"",

      "Much has changed in the 12 months since Marcus Rashford first signalled that he wanted to move on from Manchester United. The 28-year-old is currently experiencing something of a career revival with Barcelona, but his outlook once appeared far less encouraging after a breakdown in his relationship with United head coach Ruben Amorim.",
      "Following 18 months of poor form and with Amorim determined to shape his team around a strong, central No. 9, Rashford found himself at a crossroads. Despite being born and raised in Manchester, Rashford had carried ambitions that stretched beyond Old Trafford.",
      "Barcelona was always his dream move abroad. However, getting to the Camp Nou was never going to come easily and demanded both patience and resilience.",
      "When the January transfer window opened, talks with the Catalan giants took place, but a deal was never reached. Instead, Rashford sealed a loan switch to Aston Villa on deadline day, viewing it as a chance to rebuild his damaged standing.",
      "He managed just four goals in 17 games at Villa Park, yet his overall contribution in the West Midlands proved sufficient to reignite Barcelona's interest later that summer. \"I just believe that things happen when they're supposed to happen,\" Rashford told ESPN in October.",
      "\"It's not the first time I spoke with Barcelona about potentially coming here, but for whatever reasons it didn't happen in the past and now is my opportunity to make it happen. I feel like there's no time like the present now. So I just take things day to day.",
      "\"The key thing for me is just to continue to improve because when you retire, you're going to miss everything - the good stuff, the bad stuff - you're going to miss it about the sport. Every day I just take it day by day and just try to improve from the day before.\"",
      "Those comments underline Rashford's mindset - an aspect of his career that was often examined closely during his spell at United. The England forward frequently faced criticism for his conduct on and off the field, but a renewed sense of purpose and a quieter dedication to his work appear to have transformed perceptions and produced clear results.",
      "\"I was clear on my preference from the beginning,\" Rashford explained after completing his move to Barcelona in July. \"It didn't work out in January so I went to Aston Villa and enjoyed a good period there. I'm very grateful for the opportunity to play there.",
      "\"The summer came around very quickly, it was time to make another decision. My choice was easy.\"",
      "Life at Barcelona has suited Rashford well so far. He has established himself as a near constant presence in Hansi Flick's line-up, sitting out just one of Barcelona's 25 fixtures across all competitions to date.",
      "Statistics back up his importance. Rashford has delivered nine goals and 11 assists, with his influence especially evident in the Champions League, where he has been directly involved in seven goals in six matches.",
      "That resurgence has also helped him reclaim a regular role with England. As Barcelona are widely expected to make his loan deal permanent next year, Rashford's call to leave last January - no matter where he landed - looks increasingly astute.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Patrick Dorgu will have to be on his best behaviour against Wolves next week if he wants to avoid a suspension. The full-back, who scored the winner in the 1-0 clash with Newcastle United on Boxing Day, is currently walking a tightrope.",
      "The 21-year-old has totted-up four yellow cards this season after 18 games. Collecting five before reaching the 19-match threshold of a campaign triggers an automatic one-match ban for any Premier League player.",
      "This means Dorgu - and his manager for that matter - face a tense 90 minutes against Wolves in their next fixture, with three teammates unavailable due to the Africa Cup Of Nations and Bruno Fernandes amongst those still side-lined through injury.",
      "After being dropped and openly criticised by Ruben Amorim just a few weeks earlier, Dorgu has forced his way back into their starting XI with an assist (vs Aston Villa) and goal (vs Newcastle), helping United feel significantly more secure despite their depleted squad.",
      "\"He needs to be calmer playing the game,\" Amorim said during a press conference when asked about what Dorgu needs to work on, adding: \"You can feel the anxiety every time Patrick touches the ball. I can feel the anxiety.\"",
      "After that press conference, Dorgu was dropped from the United starting line-up. He was subsequently named among the substitutes for the following five fixtures, before then being brought back into the fold against Villa.",
      "Speaking to reporters after the final whistle against Newcastle, Dorgu addressed how he's handled recent criticism. He said: \"Of course, it's never nice to get criticism, but you will always get it as a player.",
      "\"And you need to react well to it, and I think I've reacted well in the last couple of games.\"",
      "He added: \"The manager spoke about my confidence a few weeks ago. I just looked inside and tried to understand what he meant. And I just tried to build myself up.\"",
      "Now perhaps a guaranteed starter for the Wolves clash on December 30, Dorgu has carved out a fresh role in the revamped line-up. But one mistake against the bottom-placed team will see the Denmark international suspended for a crucial trip to Leeds United.",
      "Amorim will be desperate to have the ex-Lecce man available for the journey to Elland Road. A few weeks back, however, he might not have anticipated relying on him so heavily.",
      "Brought back into the fold out of necessity due to three teammates being away at AFCON, Dorgu has, on initial evidence, seized his opportunity. The last thing he'll want now is to lose his grip on the starting place and hand a similar chance to another squad member under Amorim.",
      "Dorgu arrived at the club courtesy of Amorim during last season's January transfer window, with United paying £30million for his services. In his time wearing United's colours, the wing-back has racked up 38 appearances.",
      "His strike against Newcastle marked his maiden goal for the club, complementing his three assists along the way. Dorgu, who has earned 12 senior caps for Denmark, is also tied to Old Trafford until 2030.",

      "United were without Bruno Fernandes, Harry Maguire and Matthijs de Ligt for the game, while Mason Mount also went off injured. Meanwhile, Bryan Mbeumo, Amad Diallo and Noussair Mazraoui are away at the Africa Cup of Nations, forcing Ruben Amorim to adapt.",
      "The home side took the lead through Patrick Dorgu’s stunning volley from a Diogo Dalot long throw-in and then managed to weather the storm of Newcastle pressure. Key to their victory was the performance of Heaven, who slotted in at right centre-back, despite being left-footed.",
      "Amorim has been stubborn in his use of a 3-4-2-1 formation since becoming United boss, but did adapt against Newcastle, with a rare back four often resembling a back six in the latter stages of the match. It helped United keep just their second clean sheet of the season and their first since a 2-0 win over Sunderland on October 4.",
      "Former United defender Gary Neville added: “Manchester United hung in there. Heaven was absolutely brilliant. Those Newcastle players… four or five of them collapsed to the ground at the end. Heaven has been the man of the match.”",
      "“This guy (Dorgu) here helped us get there, so thankful to everyone that helped us. It was different, I was playing on the right side, obviously my weaker foot. The manager, we play loads of formations with him, whatever he does we know it’s going to work, you saw today. I’m so proud of the team.”",
      "Amorim praised his players for toughing out the win despite seeing little of the ball and was particularly happy with his young defender. “I'm really pleased with Ayden. You can feel that he’s improving every game,” he said. “He's young, but you don't feel that he has a good game and then he slows the game or the thinking during the game.",
      "“No, you feel that he’s improving during the game. I think he was not playing, but he trained really well. You just need to train really well to be ready when the opportunity comes. So, in this moment, if you continue to play like that, it's going to be really hard to take his place.”",

      "One player who's still shining, however, is Bruno Fernandes. That is until he got injured.",

      "Amorim added: “What I feel when I see them training, they are doing so much better than in games. When I see him playing for the national team, he’s scored a great goal against Scotland, the decision that he made under pressure was different to the decision that he’s making in our team.",
      "“So I just need to understand the context in trying to help them. I think they are far from the best, and they know it. Like a lot of players in our team, like myself. I think they have so much more to give. Let’s see this week if we improve that.”",
      "That improvement has been evident of late, with United now level on points with fourth-placed Chelsea and sixth-placed Liverpool, albeit their rivals have played a game fewer.",
      "The raised performances are desperately needed, given United are currently without the injured Bruno Fernandes, Mason Mount, Harry Maguire and Matthijs de Ligt, while Bryan Mbeumo, Amad Diallo and Noussair Mazraoui are away at AFCON.",

      "They returned to winning ways, even in the absence of captain Bruno Fernandes. The midfielder sustained a hamstring injury during their loss to Aston Villa, and he has barely missed any matches since signing for the club almost six years ago.",
      "United had not won a game since the first weekend of December, when they defeated Wolverhampton Wanderers 4-1 at Molineux. Next up for them is the reverse fixture as they host Wolves on 30 December, and below is a round-up of their latest injury news:",
      "Mason Mount was forced off at half-time in the victory over Newcastle. Amorim said the midfielder 'felt something' before being replaced.",
      "\"He wanted to go [on] and that is also a good thing,\" added Amorim when asked for an update on Mount's condition. \"He wanted to go to the second half but we cannot lose more players, if you are not 100 per cent.\"",
      "Potential return date: December 30 vs Wolves (H) or January 4 vs Leeds United (A)",
      "Fernandes is due to be out of action for a few weeks because of a hamstring injury. The midfielder was absent from the victory over Newcastle on Boxing Day, marking only the third time the Portugal international has missed a game due to injury since joining them.",
      "Potential return date: January",
      "Harry Maguire is still on the mend from an injury and could make a return to United's matchday squad for their Tuesday night encounter with Wolves next week. The defender has been out of action for several weeks due to injury and is nearing a return, although it's uncertain whether they will be fit to return this month.",
      "Potential return date: 30 December vs Wolves (H)",
      "Kobbie Mainoo has a calf injury that has caused him to miss United's last two matches. His return is imminent, but it remains uncertain whether the England international will be fit to play against Wolves or if he'll have to wait until the New Year.",
      "Potential return date: 30 December vs Wolves (H) or 4 January vs Leeds United (A)",
      "Matthijs de Ligt has been out of action for several weeks due to a back injury, but he's edging closer to a comeback. United are hopeful that De Ligt will be fit enough to join the squad for their clash against Wolves on Tuesday, with an update expected from head coach Amorim in the lead-up to next week's fixture.",

      "Arsenal host Brighton on Saturday afternoon in what is another must-win game for the Premier League title contenders. The Seagulls have already made the trip to the Emirates Stadium once already this season, where they were beaten 2-0 in the Carabao Cup back in October.",
      "Brighton’s in-form striker Danny Welbeck was involved on that occasion, coming off the bench to applause and adoring chants from fans of his former club. The 35-year-old will be hoping for a more successful outing for his side in N5 this time around, which is easier said than done when facing Mikel Arteta’s Gunners.",
      "Of course, Welbeck shared a dressing room with Arteta for several years. But the Englishman is currently enjoying the finest form of his career, having netted seven goals in 16 Premier League appearances this season, albeit currently struggling with a back injury.",
      "He has managed 0.64 goals per 90 minutes with a goal conversion rate of 28%, making him the joint fifth top scorer in the top flight this season. Welbeck was similarly impressive last season with 10 goals in 30 league appearances, with his latest hot streak sparking suggestions of an outside chance of making Thomas Tuchel’s England squad for this summer’s World Cup.",
      "The majority of Welbeck’s England caps came early on in his career when he still played for Manchester United. The then-promising forward realised a childhood ambition when Sir Alex Ferguson promoted him to the first-team squad in the late noughties.",
      "His breakthrough came in the 2011/12 season when he scored 12 goals, which remains his best season tally to date. Welbeck picked up several major trophies during his spell at Old Trafford, including the 2012/13 Premier League title, though his United future was thrown into doubt after Ferguson’s retirement.",
      "During David Moyes' short tenure, Welbeck was frequently deployed out wide and his opportunities became even more limited when Louis van Gaal took charge. That led to a shock £16million deadline day move to rivals Arsenal in 2014, with Arsene Wenger famously snatching him from Tottenham’s grasp while in Rome for a Pope-related charity event.",
      "Later explaining his bold decision to leave his boyhood club, Welbeck said: \"At the time I was playing on the left-wing a lot and in a 4-4-2, which is very difficult for me because I can't make an impact on the game. I can play it to the best of my ability but that's not best for the team, and I could make a bigger impact playing in my preferred position.\"",
      "He continued: \"You start to have thoughts but at that time you're still going to training and I was still giving 100 per cent and giving my all in every single game - that's just me, I'm not going to change that. But you do start to think about what's best for you.\"",
      "Then-United boss Van Gaal made sure to take a swipe at Welbeck at the time, saying: \"He has played, after [his loan spell at] Sunderland, three seasons at Manchester United but he doesn't have the record of [Robin] Van Persie or [Wayne] Rooney and that is the standard.\"",
      "Welbeck, determined to silence his critics, became a fan-favourite at Arsenal thanks to some crucial goals, including three against his former side, and two FA Cup triumphs. But his five years in north London were marred by repeated injuries.",
      "He left the Gunners in 2019 off the back of a broken ankle suffered in the Europa League group stage, having scored 32 goals in 126 appearances for the club.",
      "A difficult campaign with Watford followed in 2019/20 as the side were relegated. Welbeck then made one of the best decisions of his career by joining Brighton as a free agent in October 2020, while Graham Potter was still in charge.",
      "Welbeck has since racked up more appearances and goals for the Seagulls than either of the two Premier League giants he represented in the past, managing 44 finishes in 179 matches. While not a particularly impressive goal-scoring ratio, the last two seasons have seen the former England international develop into a more mature finisher in front of goal.",
      "This season, he is well on track to reach double figures in all competitions for the fifth time in his career. Speaking about his goal-scoring run, Welbeck told The Argus earlier in the season: \"I'm happier than ever. I think the main thing for me is the consistency of staying on the pitch and getting a rhythm of playing game after game after game.",
      "\"Unfortunately, throughout my career, I've had some really big injuries that have maybe derailed that, and it's difficult. You have to try and get back into form, you have to try and get back to match fitness and that sort of stuff. But the last couple years have been really good, and I'm feeling really good. Long may it continue.”",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "With the January transfer window just around the corner, Old Trafford is once again buzzing with excitement and anticipation. Manchester United are no strangers to busy windows, although their record in the winter market has been decidedly mixed.",
      "For every Bruno Fernandes and Nemanja Vidic there's been an Alexis Sanchez and a Dong Fangzhuo. January has often proved a tricky period form-wise for the Red Devils too, but shrewd business next month could provide the spark Ruben Amorim's side need to kick on and mount a serious push for a Champions League place.",
      "Links to big-name arrivals have been circulating for weeks, alongside rumours of high-profile departures. While no deals have been completed yet, one thing is certain: when it comes to Manchester United and the transfer window, drama is never far away. With that in mind, here are the latest United-related headlines:",
      "Amorim has admitted that it would be \"hard\" to sanction a loan exit for Kobbie Mainoo, particularly if United don't source a replacement for him. Mainoo has spent the bulk of the season watching on from the subs' bench, leaving his United future - and his spot in England's World Cup squad - in serious jeopardy.",
      "The 20-year-old requested to leave on loan in the summer transfer window and is expected to push for an exit again in January. But with Amorim's squad looking a little light in midfield at the moment, particularly after Fernandes limped off against Aston Villa last weekend, his request may once again be denied.",
      "\"If we are not getting someone [in], then we are shorter [in midfield],\" the Portuguese manager said. \"Even with a full squad, we are shorter when something can happen here.",
      "\"We are a club with a big responsibility, we are dealing with all these issues and in your head, my head, and everyone's heads, we need to win every game, it doesn't matter, there are no excuses, so it's going to be hard for someone to leave the club if we don't get a substitution [new signing].\"",
      "When asked whether Mainoo could kick on when he returns to fitness in the absence of Fernandes, Amorim said: \"He will have the opportunity that he has all the time. He played in different positions and we talk about the position of Casemiro - he can do that. He can play, if you play with three, like we did in the last game, the position of Mason Mount in this game, he can play there.",
      "\"He is going to be the future of Manchester United. That is my feeling, so he just needs to wait for his chance and everything can change in football, even in two days.\"",
      "Manchester United are reportedly considering a surprise move for former academy graduate James Garner. The 24-year-old spent nine years at Old Trafford and made seven senior appearances before joining Everton in 2022, following loan spells at Nottingham Forest and Watford.",
      "Garner has since established himself as a regular at Goodison Park and, according to the Daily Mail, United are monitoring the possibility of a cut-price reunion. His Everton contract expires at the end of the season, giving the Red Devils a chance to bolster their midfield at minimal cost, with the Merseyside club likely keen to avoid losing him for nothing in the summer.",
      "A return for Garner could open the door for Mainoo to leave on loan and may prove particularly important if Manuel Ugarte - also linked with an exit - leaves the club in January. While United continue to track higher-profile midfield targets such as Carlos Baleba, Elliott Anderson and Adam Wharton, Garner represents a more economical alternative.",
      "Crucially, he would require little time to settle, given his familiarity with the club, and offers reliable energy, work rate and depth in midfield. Garner made just two Premier League appearances for United but featured more frequently in the Europa League, with all seven of his senior outings coming during the 2018/19 and 2019/20 seasons.",

      "Ince, 58, eventually found his way to Wolves, who make their own trip to Anfield on Saturday. And there's no comparing his relationship with Liverpool's loyalists compared to those at Old Trafford.",
      "The former England international, who has taken aim at United fans before, is understood to have fallen out with Sir Alex Ferguson prior to joining Inter Milan in 1995. However, any vitriol from United fans is largely due to the fact 'The Guv'nor' later joined bitter nemeses Liverpool.",
      "Ince captained Middlesbrough against United and later took the armband with Wolves when he again returned to Old Trafford over the years. And while he's always had a fond relationship with Liverpool's support, the same can't be said for those in Manchester.",
      "\"I get a lot of grief from Manchester United fans and I can't understand it,\" said Ince back in 2002. \"They should remember I was part of the team that took the title back to Old Trafford for the first time in 26 years.",
      "\"I sweated blood and shed tears in my six years at United and I think I should be respected for that. But all I get is stick whenever I go there because Ferguson once called me a 'big-time Charlie' in some television programme. So now it's a case of, 'Let's wind him up again.'\"",
      "Ince, who won two Premier League titles and two FA Cups at United, went on to acknowledge he \"didn't leave Liverpool in the best circumstances\" after clashing with then-manager Gerard Houllier. However, it wasn't enough to make the fans turn on him.",
      "In fact, he put the Reds supporters in a bracket of their own when discussing the contrast between the two fanbases years later. And those in attendance for the Christmas showdown against Wolves will be hoping to prove much of his praise remains accurate to this day.",
      "\"Liverpool European nights, you can’t beat them,\" he said on the Blood Red podcast in 2019. “They’re special and it is iconic with all the flags. It is amazing. I think the atmosphere depends on the time, doesn’t it? When we look at Old Trafford, because it is so vast now, it is so corporate, it’s not the atmosphere that you do get at Liverpool.",
      "\"I love the Liverpool people. They come and support the team, they know football and they back their players. But one thing about the two teams, you never see them boo their players off, or very rarely. They are understanding fans. They are different atmospheres in different ways, but I like the way Liverpool look after their players, look after their own.\"",
      "Following a dire run of form in recent months, Liverpool now find themselves seeking a fourth straight win at home to Wolves. Victory on Saturday would at least temporarily take Arne Slot's men into fourth, with Chelsea set to host Aston Villa later this evening.",

      "Ruben Amorim says Mason Mount wanted to play on after picking up an injury against Newcastle. However, the Manchester United head coach said the club couldn't afford to risk losing another midfielder for an extended period.",
      "United were down to the bare bones against Eddie Howe's side, with captain Bruno Fernandes, midfielder Kobbie Mainoo and centre-backs Matthijs de Ligt and Harry Maguire among those missing. They also saw Mount forced off at half-time, with teenager Jack Fletcher taking his place for the second 45 minutes.",
      "\"It's a very important moment for any kid. He's going to hear from his father. He's going to talk a lot about a lot of things, but he needs to calm down and just praise the kid because he's really humble, works really hard, and he deserves this.\"",
      "Despite the absences, Amorim's team ground out a hard-fought victory thanks to a rare clean sheet. Patrick Dorgu was the unlikely hero, volleying home his first goal for the club in style, and the Danish international impressed in a more advanced role than the one he is used to.",
      "\"It was a good hit. I didn't know I could do that, but I was very happy to score my first goal in this stadium as well. It was amazing,\" Dorgu said after the victory.",
      "\"I just took what [Amorim] told me to work on my confidence and stuff. I think I did well today. I just looked at the ball, saw it drop, and I just hit it. I've been practicing in training, so I think that's what helped me.\"",
      "Amorim also said last December's 2-0 defeat at home to Newcastle played on his mind when making the unexpected decision to switch to a back four. \"In the first half, I think we showed that I felt that was the only way to create more danger, to have more opportunities was with the back four with a lot of guys inside,\" he said.",

      "Manchester United climbed to fifth in the Premier League standings following a 1-0 victory over Newcastle, thanks to a tactical switch by Ruben Amorim. Despite being under pressure for much of the second half, United managed to maintain their narrow lead for more than an hour.",
      "The solitary goal came from an unexpected avenue. Patrick Dorgu capitalised on a partially cleared long throw, volleying it into the bottom corner from just inside the Newcastle box to score what proved to be the winner. United also hit the woodwork through Benjamin Sesko, but saw their opponents do the same when Lewis Hall went close.",

      "His first start at left-back in 18 months after an extended spell as one of Amorim's three centre-backs. Had a few shaky moments but overall coped well and managed to keep Jacob Murphy at bay in the second half.",

      "Scored his goal in some style and his confidence visibly soared afterwards. He was diligent in defence and continued to pose a threat when attacking. His best performance for United yet.",
      "Once again, he set the pace with excellent pressing in the first half and some great link-up play. If he's now out injured, as feared, it would be a significant loss.",
      "He was dynamic in the first half but struggled to make as much of an impact after the break.",
      "A marked improvement from recent performances. He hit the bar with his last touch of the game but held the ball well in the first half and appeared stronger.",
      "Initially taken aback by the game's speed and physicality, but he adjusted well. He made one good pass to put Dorgu behind Miley.",

      "The visitors continued to put the pressure on as the game ticked on, with Anthony Gordon dragging an effort wide. The cavalry arrived moments later, with Eddie Howe introducing Yoane Wissa, Harvey Barnes and Joelinton as his side chased a leveller.",
      "Diogo Dalot missed a golden chance for a second, breaking beyond the Newcastle back-line but lifting his effort over the bar, while Matheus Cunha dragged an effort of his own well wide after a driving run. One goal was enough, though, and here are our talking points from Old Trafford.",
      "Nearly 11 months after joining Manchester United, Patrick Dorgu finally has his first goal for the club. It was a thumper, too, with the Dane running onto Nick Woltemade's headed clearance and thumping the ball out of the reach of Aaron Ramsdale.",
      "Former Lecce star Dorgu clearly had an eye for goal after getting his opener, putting Ramsdale to the test with a low right-footed effort before half-time. He spent the whole game high up the pitch, be that on the right or the left, and caused problems throughout.",
      "Earlier in the season, Ruben Amorim said he wanted to see Dorgu show more of his Denmark form in a United shirt. Odds are this was the kind of thing he was after.",
      "Manchester United saw Bruno Fernandes forced off against Aston Villa, and that will have been a worry. In their last seven league games without their captain in the starting XI, they had taken just one point.",
      "Amorim recognised it would be a tall order making up for the skipper's absence but insisted United had options. Indeed, for the first 45 minutes you'd have been hard-pressed to tell which was the team missing a key player.",
      "United looked down to the bare bones late on, and there was even a rare outing from the bench for Tyrell Malacia. They weren't doing things the easy way, but they won't complain about the result.",
      "After dismissing the idea time and time again, Ruben Amorim appeared to abandon his usual back three - at least at the start of the game. Patrick Dorgu moved into a right wing role in front of Diogo Dalot, with Luke Shaw staying wide at left-back as Ayden Heaven partnered Lisandro Martinez in the middle.",
      "Now, don't get us wrong, there's every chance the change was made out of pure necessity. Both Noussair Mazraoui and Amad are away at the Africa Cup of Nations, robbing United of two more natural wing-back options, while Dorgu might also have been used there were he not filling in for another AFCON absentee in Bryan Mbeumo.",
      "Certainly, the move appeared to catch Newcastle by surprise. A message arrived with Lewis Hall during a stoppage, allowing the visitors to put their own adjustments into force.",
      "United remained on top before adding an extra centre-back in the form of Leny Yoro. That too was a bait-and-switch, though, with the Frenchman moving to right-back and Dalot thrust forward onto the wing.",
      "Before kick-off, some United fans were making the case for Jack Fletcher to start. The teenager had made his Premier League debut on Sunday and might have fancied his chances with Fernandes injured, but instead started on the bench.",
      "At the start of the second half, though, Mason Mount's withdrawal gave the youngster his chance. That meant an advanced role to begin with, and Fletcher was forced to be flexible as others were withdrawn.",
      "Fletcher's twin brother Tyler was also on the bench for United, among a youthful selection, with Tyler Fredricson introduced late on. United might be far from full strength, but the future is starting to look bright.",
      "This time last year, United put in one of their most miserable first half displays of the early part of Ruben Amorim's tenure. They found themselves 2-0 down inside 20 minutes before Amorim ruthlessly substituted Joshua Zirkzee before half-time.",
      "It was a different story this time. Tonight, Amorim's side were the ones starting quickly and their opponents - barring a few brief flashes - didn't really get a foothold until the second period.",
      "There was even time for Zirkzee to pursue a redemption arc on his personal level after arriving for the final half-hour. It was Newcastle doing most of the attacking by then, though, with the hosts' task one of containment, but revenge will have no doubt been sweet.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Manchester United head coach Ruben Amorim named not one but two Fletcher brothers on his bench for the Premier League clash with Newcastle United on Boxing Day. Jack made his Premier League debut less than a week earlier, coming on as United lost to Aston Villa.",
      "Amorim is short on numbers, with Bruno Fernandes and Kobbie Mainoo both injured. He expects Mainoo to be back sooner than captain Fernandes, and will have been grateful to be able to welcome back Casemiro after a one-game ban.",
      "The Fletcher twins, sons of former United midfielder Darren, joined the Red Devils from Manchester City's academy in 2023. A reported fee of £1.25million was enough to bring the pair to Old Trafford, where they have been playing at age group level.",
      "Darren was a Scotland international during his playing career, winning 81 senior international caps. Tyler is also in the Scotland youth set-up, but Jack has instead opted for England.",
      "\"I think Jack Fletcher did a very good job and that's why when we have this opportunity, we need to give space to guys like Jack and the other ones. So, we'll find solutions to play,” Amorim told reporters on Wednesday.",
      "The brothers were born in England while their dad was part of United's first team under Sir Alex Ferguson, meaning they could choose to represent either England or Scotland. Ferguson's team actually had a game on the day of their birth, but Darren wasn't involved as he'd been sidelined with an ankle ligament injury at the time.",
      "Jack has opted to represent the country of his birth at international level, though he also played for Scotland's Under-16s when he was younger. He played twice for Will Antwi's England Under-19 side during the November international break, scoring in a 4-0 victory over Scotland.",
      "Tyler was on the opposite team that day, captaining the Scottish selection. He also scored his first goal at Under-19 international level in a 2-2 draw away to Latvia earlier that month.",
      "United fans were excited to see both brothers on Amorim's bench for the Newcastle game. \"So happy to see the Fletcher twins on the bench together. What a moment for them and their family,\" one wrote.",
      "\"It must be a proud moment for the Fletcher family,\" a second said. Others, meanwhile, made it clear they would have liked to see Jack Fletcher start the game ahead of Manuel Ugarte, who struggled against Villa on Sunday.",
      "Another became painfully aware of the passage of time when looking at the teamsheet. \"From watching Darren Fletcher during his prime back in college to this, football ageing just felt real again,\" they said.",

      "Manchester United defender Patrick Dorgu believes he has responded to Ruben Amorim's criticism with his recent performances. At the end of November, Amorim said he could feel \"anxiety\" from Dorgu when he picked up the ball, and suggested the Denmark international needed to perform better.",
      "\"He needs to be calmer playing the game,\" said Amorim to a question about what Dorgu needs to improve. \"You can feel the anxiety every time Patrick touches the ball. I can feel the anxiety.\"",
      "Following that press conference, Dorgu lost his starting place. He was named on the bench for the next five matches, but he was recalled to the starting team against Aston Villa last weekend.",
      "The 21-year-old assisted Matheus Cunha for United's goal in the Midlands and delivered another improved performance against Newcastle, scoring in the first half with a brilliant volley to claim three points for United.",
      "Dorgu spoke to reporters following the full-time whistle and was asked how he dealt with the criticism. \"Of course it's never nice to get criticism, but you will always get it as a player,\" he said. \"And you need to react well to it, and I think I've reacted well in the last couple of games.\"",
      "He added: \"The manager spoke about my confidence a few weeks ago, so I just looked inside and tried to understand what he meant. And I just tried to build myself up.\"",
      "Dorgu sought advice from the leadership group in the dressing room, which includes Bruno Fernandes, Diogo Dalot, Noussair Mazraoui, Lisandro Martinez, Harry Maguire and Tom Heaton. \"My teammates help me as well,\" he added. I spoke to Bruno [Fernandes] and some of the leader group in my team. They just try to help me on a daily basis to grow in confidence in training and stuff. \"",
      "Dorgu continued: \"We have players at AFCON and injured players, so this is my chance to show I belong in this team, and I feel like I'm doing it in the last couple of games, so I just need to keep going and try to keep the manager happy.\"",
      "Dorgu played on the right, in a more prominent position, against Newcastle. \"I've done that in my old team as well, so it's nothing new to me. I'm just happy to score the goal,\" he said. \"I've been training to shoot more in the games and I think I hit it really well. I'm really happy that it went in. I knew already a few days ago [about playing on the right], so I just tried to remember how to play there.",
      "\"It's the same, just you come inside to your stronger foot, so sometimes it's even easier to attack and connect with the teammates, so I find it really easy.\"",

      "A few months ago, Ruben Amorim said even the Pope couldn't convince him to change his system at Manchester United, but on the second day of Christmas, he gave in to popular demand. If a back three is United's past, then could this back four be their future?",
      "Amorim had been teasing the idea of a change of shape in recent weeks and had worked on it in training, so the ghosts of Christmas hadn't visited him in his sleep and brought about an epiphany, yet however it came about, Old Trafford delighted in the reversion to a flat back four and the end of wing-backs.",
      "There is enough material from the past 13 months to give Amorim nightmares, but this change in formation delivered a change in fortunes as well. After six weeks of blowing chance after chance to go fifth in the Premier League, they finally took it. It might last for less than 24 hours, but it shows that this side is in the hunt for a Champions League spot, even if they spent almost the entire second half on the back foot.",
      "When the teamsheets dropped at Old Trafford, it didn't look like it was the night when Amorim changed his ways, but Patrick Dorgu was right-wing rather than left-wing back. That change caught Newcastle by surprise.",
      "On the touchline, Eddie Howe and Jason Tindall debated a solution, while the Newcastle analysts sat in the press box tried to work out what was happening. The shrugging of shoulders showed they hadn't been expecting this.",
      "A few weeks ago, Amorim had talked of the anxiety he could feel whenever Dorgu was on the ball, so when he watched his left-wing-back-cum-right-winger settle over a dropping ball 16 yards from goal, he probably didn't expect to see a sweetly struck volley whizz past Aaron Ramsdale and into the corner of the net.",
      "Dorgu visibly grew in confidence after that. He forced Ramsdale into a smart save soon after and contributed defensively with one thunderous tackle on Lewis Hall that earned a chest bump from Casemiro, but the loss of Mason Mount to injury at half-time turned this into a rearguard effort.",
      "Fabian Schar saw a shot deflected just wide from a corner and was furious when Newcastle were denied a penalty when his shot was blocked by the arms of Lisandro Martinez. Lewis Hall hit the bar from distance and Anthony Gordon dragged a shot narrowly wide.",
      "United's attacks were few and far between. Benjamin Sesko clipped the top of the bar with a left-footed shot in his last action before being replaced by Joshua Zirkzee, part of a double change that saw Leny Yoro come on, giving the hosts the chance to drop into a back six when required.",
      "And it was needed regularly as Newcastle piled on the pressure. Diogo Dalot and Dorgu were wingers dropping in at full-back as Yoro and Luke Shaw went narrow.",
      "Senne Lammens saved from Joelinton and plucked a cross-shot from Joe Willock out of the air. Anthony Gordon should have done better than swiping a shot over after good work by Harvey Barnes, Schar looped a header onto the roof of the net and then Lewis Miley fired wide from 12 yards.",
      "It summed up Newcastle’s wastefulness in the final third as wave after wave of attack came to nothing. It wasn’t convincing from Amorim’s side, especially after the break, but after four successive defeats without Bruno Fernandes in the Premier League, victory was all that mattered.",
      "Fernandes was in the directors' box to watch his teammates go into battle without him. Amorim had talked of how difficult it was to replace the captain on Christmas Eve and with Mount missing as well, United's creativity is being tested. That this game finished with Jack Fletcher and Tyler Fredricson on the pitch, as well as the lesser-spotted Tyrell Malacia, said everything about the resources Amorim now has at his disposal.",
      "He will need to continue to find solutions over the next few weeks, but the fist-pumps that greeted this victory showed how valuable it was, and the sight of Lisandro Martinez blowing kisses to the Stretford End was a reminder that at least one key man is back in the groove. The Argentine was vital to this defensive effort and proved to be the perfect stand-in for Fernandes.",

      "Ruben Amorim said Manchester United's backs-to-the-wall win against Newcastle United was one of his best as Old Trafford boss after his injury-hit side held on to a valuable three points against the Magpies. United were down to the bare bones after losing Mason Mount at half-time and they had to hold on during a second-half onslaught to earn a 1-0 win that temporarily moved them into fifth in the Premier League.",
      "Although United have produced more convincing performances under Amorim, the Portuguese head coach hailed it as one of his best wins during his 13 months in charge and insists the spirit they showed could be valuable in spreading belief through the squad.",
      "Asked if the win was one of his most enjoyable, he said: \"Yeah, especially if you see the second half, we managed to defend sometimes with a back six, but we suffer together, and that is a good feeling. I felt we are here talking about the game, and if we always have this spirit, we are going to win so many games. We need to feel we can win games without playing so well and win with spirit and togetherness.\"",
      "It was just a second clean sheet of the season and Amorim felt the luck was on United's side against Newcastle when it has deserted them at other times this season. \"The feeling is good but if you compare to other games we suffered so much more today, but in certain moments we put everything on the line,\" he said. \"We’re defending every cross, trying to push out the box, that is a good feeling to have but we had so many games we controlled much better and conceded a goal.\"",

      "United were pinned back for much of the second half and had to produce a defensive rearguard to hold on to the lead given them before the break.",
      "Senne Lammens: Good save from Guimaraes in the first half and solid after the break as Newcastle piled on the pressure. 7",
      "Diogo Dalot: Back in a familiar right-back position and moved into the attack in the second half. Tested by Gordon and had to run back with Hall as United sought to hold on. 6",
      "Ayden Heaven: Starting ahead of Yoro was a show of faith from Amorim and did well against Woltemade. Confidence is returning after a spell on the sidelines. 8",
      "Lisandro Martinez: Won a header against Woltemade in the first half and found his passing range again. Named captain on his return and defended very well. 8",
      "Luke Shaw: A first start at left-back in 18 months. The odd shaky moment but came through it well and saw off Murphy in the second half. 6",
      "Manuel Ugarte: His Cruyff turn in the first half summed up the confidence United were playing with. Still not great in possession but battled hard without the ball. 7",
      "Casemiro: Surprised to see his number go up early in the second half. Missed a good early chance but couldn't control the game after the break. 6",
      "Patrick Dorgu: Took his goal brilliantly and visibly grew in confidence after that. Diligent defensively and remained a real threat running forward. Best game for United. 8",
      "Mason Mount: Set the tone again with some excellent pressing in the first half and some fine link-up play. Would be a big miss if he is now on the injured list. 7",
      "Matheus Cunha: A livewire performance in the first half but struggled to influence the game after the break. 7",
      "Benjamin Sesko: Much better than of late. Hit the bar with his final touch of the game but held the ball up well in the first half and looked stronger. 7",
      "Substitutes",
      "Jack Fletcher: Surprised by the pace and physicality of the game early on but settled well. One good pass to get Dorgu in behind Miley. 6",
      "Leny Yoro: Read the game well at right-back and contributed to a solid defensive effort. 7",
      "Joshua Zirkzee: Barely saw the ball as United retreated. 6",
      "Tyrell Malacia: No time to make an impact.",
      "Tyler Fredricson: No time to make an impact.",

      "Ruben Amorim has told Ayden Heaven his place in the Manchester United starting XI is safe if he continues the rich vein of form he has shown in the last couple of games. The 19-year-old has started five games in a row for United and has raised his performance levels during that run, producing an outstanding display in a rearguard defensive effort in the 1-0 win against Newcastle on Boxing Day.",
      "Heaven, a £1million signing from Arsenal last January, has had to be patient for his chance this season but he has taken it when the opportunity arrived and was selected ahead of Leny Yoro against Newcastle. The teenager was named man of the match on TV as United showed tenacity in the second half and Amorim was delighted with the youngster's display.",
      "\"Really pleased with Ayden, he’s improving every game,\" he said. \"He’s young but you don’t feel he has a good game and slows the thinking. \"He was not playing but he trained really well to be ready when the opportunity comes. If he continues to play like that it’s going to be hard to take his place.\"",
      "Heaven started in a back four against the Magpies and that meant Patrick Dorgu reverted to right-wing, netting his first goal for the club with a stunning volley. It was his best performance since joining United last January and Amorim felt the freedom afforded the Denmark international in a more advanced role played into his hands.",
      "\"It’s the normal life of a player, sometimes you are in a good moment, sometimes you struggle. It depends on the team or the game,\" the United head coach said. \"Maybe the game today, with a lot of transitions, is good for his pace and ability to drive the ball. He played in a position where he can take more risk, that can help him not feel the responsibility.\"",
      "Amorim also reserved praise for Lisandro Martinez, who captained the team in the absence of Bruno Fernandes and on his first start since February 2.",
      "\"He’s a guy with a lot of character, really good on the ball, he won the World Cup, he’s used to that stress and showed today he is a top player,\" he said. \"He’s a small guy but today he did really well against a team who has tall players.\"",

      "Manchester United showed their gritty side on Boxing Day as they overcame injuries to defeat Newcastle 1-0 at Old Trafford. The Reds were deservedly ahead at the break thanks to Patrick Dorgu's stunning volley which Aaron Ramsdale could only get a palm to.",
      "However, the second half proved to be a backs-to-the-wall effort as the visitors pushed for the equaliser and United were forced to re-evaluate their system. Mason Mount came off at the interval having 'felt something' and it remains to be seen how long he will be out for.",
      "The lingering concern for Ruben Amorim now will be how he lines up should Mount not be fit enough to start against Wolverhampton Wanderers on Tuesday night. MEN Sport has taken a look at three different systems he could deploy.",
      "For the first time under Amorim, United played with a flat back four and it worked. While that four may have turned into a six as the Reds absorbed pressure, the initial system which worked so well in the first half was a 4-2-3-1.",
      "If Amorim wishes to use this again, he could make a relatively straightforward swap bringing Joshua Zirkzee into the starting XI. Some of Zirkzee's best performances have come as a No.10 for the Reds and the United boss has previously admitted the Dutchman can operate as a centre-forward and an attacking midfielder.",
      "The issue with this is that you would be starting both Zirkzee and Sesko meaning there would be no first-team centre-forward on the bench. However, in this current situation, Amorim cannot afford to be too picky.",
      "Having reverted to one four at the back system, Amorim may be thinking: 'Why not try another against Wolves?' In this instance, a 4-3-3 could work if he trusts Jack Fletcher from the start.",
      "After the win on Boxing Day, Amorim said: \"Jack [Fletcher] did a very good job. It's a very important moment for any kid. He's going to hear from his father. He's going to talk a lot about a lot of things, but he needs to calm down and just praise the kid because he's really humble, works really hard, and he deserves this.\"",
      "Like Kobbie Mainoo when he was called upon against Everton under Erik ten Hag, Amorim may feel Fletcher is ready and against the worst team in the league, why not experiment?",
      "Should Amorim feel a back three is needed, he could pick a strong line-up albeit the bench will be compromised somewhat. Luke Shaw or Lisandro Martinez would be casualties in this system despite both playing well against Newcastle which may prevent this change.",
      "Also, like 4-2-3-1, it would mean having to start Zirkzee as a No.10 alongside Matheus Cunha. This again means there would be no first choice striker on the bench.",
      "Amorim has to decide whether he is picking a team to have a strong bench or a starting line-up which has the best chance of winning without relying on substitutes. Ideally you want both but that is a luxury they don't have.",

      "Welcome to the live Manchester United blog on Saturday, 27 December.",
      "It's not long until the team are back in action as they return to Old Trafford on Tuesday when they host bottom of the table Wolves (8.15pm kick-off).",
      "That game will be the final one before teams can add to their squad in the January transfer window, which opens on New Year's Day.",
      "Ahead of the window opening, United have been linked with several incomings and outgoings. Bournemouth's Antoine Semenyo is a name that has been talked about a lot, but United have a lot of competition for the forward.",
      "Midfield is expected to be an area of priority with Nottingham Forest's Elliot Anderson, Crystal Palace's Adam Wharton and Atletico Madrid's Conor Gallagher possible targets.",
      "There is also a lot of talk over possible exits. Joshua Zirkzee has been heavily linked with a move to Roma, while Napoli are said to be showing an interest in Kobbie Mainoo. There is also talk about a possible permanent deal for on loan striker Marcus Rashford.",
      "We'll bring you all the latest updates, news and transfer rumours throughout the day in our live blog below.",
      "As per Gazzetta, Joshua Zirkzee has had a number of \"discussions and contacts\" with Roma management as of recent, particularly speaking with sporting director, Ricky Massara, and Giallorossi head coach, Gian Piero Gasperini.",
      "The publication claim that the Dutch forward has gone as far as \"promising\" himself to Roma by saying 'yes' to a move when the window opens, as it looks increasingly likely that he will make a grand return to Serie A in mid-January, when Bryan Mbeumo, Amad and Noussair Mazraoui return from AFCON.",
      "Ruben Amorim is \"happy\" with Casemiro and Harry Maguire, but could not answer whether a decision had been made on both players' futures ahead of their contract expiry at the end of the season.",
      "Casemiro, 33, has enjoyed a renaissance at Old Trafford, becoming an important player again after a period of not starting games under Amorim.",

      "Many United fans will be wondering when their three stars could return. Morocco are tipped to clinch their first Afcon title since 1976, as per a new AFCON Supercomputer prediction.",
      "The forecast by AFCON betting experts at BookmakersCameroun.com suggests that the host nation will triumph over Senegal with a 1-0 victory in the final. That would mean that United and Morocco's Mazraoui won't be available for Reds boss Ruben Amorim until an away clash against Arsenal on January 25.",

      "A great deal has changed in the 12 months since Marcus Rashford first made clear his desire to leave Manchester United.",
      "The 28-year-old forward, now enjoying something of a career resurgence at Barcelona, appeared to be facing a bleak future after falling out with United manager Ruben Amorim. After 18 months of disappointing form and with Amorim intent on building his side around a powerful, focal-point No. 9, Rashford found himself at a crossroads.",
      "Although born and raised in Manchester, Rashford had long harboured a dream beyond the walls of Old Trafford - and that dream was Barcelona. But reaching the Camp Nou would require patience and perseverance.",
      "Read more here",
      "United are among a wealth of clubs who are currently said to be keeping tabs on AZ prospect, Kees Smit. The 19-year-old midfielder has impressed in the Eredivisie, having broken through the youth academy last year.",
      "This season, the Dutch U21 has racked up two goals and two assists from 15 appearances, instrumental in his club's success as they sit sixth in the league standings. And as a result, a number of teams across the world have had their heads turned.",
      "It's no secret that the Reds are looking to strengthen their engine room in January, given Bruno Fernandes has dropped into a deeper role alongside an ageing Casemiro who sees his future with the club beyond 2025/26 cast into speculation.",

      "The two possibilities over the player include him providing competition to the United midfield, or another loan back to the Championship with several clubs reportedly showing an interest.",
      "It's a waiting game for Joshua Zirkzee with talks between the player and Roma 'advanced', according to Ben Jacobs.",
      "It's reported that United haven't imformed either Zirkzee or Roma if they are prepared to sanction an exit during the January transfer window.",
      "The striker was a second half substitute in last night's Premier League win over Newcastle.",
      "Manchester United are unlikley to look for an alternative target to Antoine Semenyo in the January transfer window, although it's a position that is likely tp be looked at again in future windows, according to journalist David Ornstein.",
      "United look to be missing out on the Bournemouth man, who prefers a move to Manchester City.",
      "Speaking to NBC Sport, Ornstein said:",
      "\"With Semenyo I think it was mor a market opportunity, they wanted to sign him instead of necessarily focusing immediately on that position, it doesn't mean that they will definitely go for an alternative for that wide attacking role now or in the summer, but I do think it's on the agenda to fill it at some point because you've got the likes of Rashford potentially leaving when his Barcelona loan expires and Jadon Sancho as well, so there is scope for that left attacking role to be filled.\"",
      "United are in advanced duscussions with Lassine Sinayoko over a summer move, according to reports.",
      "The AJ Auxerre forward is currently away with Mali in the Africa Cup of Nations. He is in the final six months of his contract with the club, meaning that he is available on a free transfer in the summer.",
      "AfricaFoot report that United are 'finalising' a deal that will see the player earn a €3 million (£2.6m) salary. Discussions are reported to be continuing.",
      "Manchester United have 'pushed hard' to sign Antoine Semenyo in January, but the lack of European football could be their downfall in the persuit, according to journalist David Ornstein.",
      "The player is said to be leaning towards a move to Man City, with formal steps expected to take place when the window opens.",
      "Speaking to NBC Sports, Ornstein said:",
      "\"Antoine Semenyo's preference is to join Manchester City in the January transfer window, it's not a done deal just yet and of course, City will need to agree personal terms with Semenyo and also negotiate the payment terms of the £65 million release clause that is in his Bournemouth contract. We will expect formal steps to be taken in the days ahead. \"",
      "\"There was strong interest from Manchester United, they did push hard, but ultimately, it's pretty difficult for them to compete when they don't have European football at the moment for these top players.\"",
      "Manchester United have been handed a transfer blow with RB Leipzig's Yan Diomande reportedly not leaving the club in January.",
      "TEAMtalk report that United have joined the race for the teenager, and spoke to the player's camp a couple of weeks ago.",

      "United legend Rio Ferdinand has predicted that Senne Lammens will be the club's first choice goalkeeper for the next ten years following his summer move to Old Trafford.",
      "The 23-year-old helped United to keep a clean sheet in last night's 1-0 win over Newcastle and has so far impressed in his performances in the side.",
      "Speaking on his YouTube channel, Ferdinand said:",
      "“Do you know what, Lammens is a solid addition to this squad. He’s going to be Manchester United’s keeper for the next 10 years, no doubt.",
      "“He is as solid as a rock. No frills, just gets it done. Look, you need him to come out to claim it on the edge of his six-yard box, he comes and just takes one through bodies, beautiful to see.",
      "“You want a solid keeper, you know where he’s going to be.",
      "“I bet he’s a boring fella, I bet there’s no much in terms of that but he’s intelligent, a lovely guy, really nice guy but on a night out I don’t reckon he’d be one of the ones you’d want to spend most of the night with, no disrespect, most goalkeepers aren’t anyway.",
      "“But when you get to the football pitch you’d be going, ‘you know what, I hope he’s behind me’, he looks like one of those.",
      "“We’ve been searching for a consistent goalkeeper, someone you know where they’re going to be when you look around.",
      "“In the last seven minutes of extra time he’s come out and took two balls in his six-yard box comfortably. Takes the pressure off the back four, absolute life saver if you’re a defender.",
      "“It’s a great feeling to know where your goalkeeper is exactly going to be when you turn around and Lammens is one of those.”",
      "With three points already secured, United can put their feet up and watch the action from afar as other Premier League clubs battle it out for the points today.",

      "Gary Neville has heaped praise on united defender Ayden Heaven for his role in keeping a clean sheet in last night's 1-0 win over Newcastle, despite the pressure from the opposition.",
      "\"He [Ayden Heaven] was absolutely outstanding, that young man. He was absolutely brilliant. He headed everything clear, and he rightly gets a hug from Luke Shaw and the coaching staff.\"",
      "Manchester United have been urged to sign Aston Villa's Morgan Rogers in the January transfer window, with the England man described as the 'dream' transfer by Louis Saha.",
      "Speaking to FootItalia, he said:",
      "\"I think Manchester United have done some really good business and I’ve loved to see the team grow. The goalkeeper, Senne Lammens, was an amazing signing, I think it really helped our stability,\" he opined.",
      "\"In January, I see a need for a replacement who can spark our midfield creativity. In addition to Bruno Fernandes and Mason Mount, there’s a need for speed in the creativity there. I see Rogers as being able to actually bomb forward, but also get pressed and keep the ball, giving time for other players to move into different positions.",
      "\"He is the type of player United need. It's a very interesting profile that's rare in the sense that a lot of players are very athletic, but in terms of making the right choice with that athleticism, that's not easy. So I can see Rogers as being a dream signing.\"",

      "The former Premier League official Keith Hackett believes referee Anthony Taylor was right not to award Newcastle United a penalty for handball by Manchester United captain Lisandro Martinez.",
      "A shot from Fabian Schar struck the United skipper inside the six-yard box. Martinez claimed to Taylor afterwards that the ball actually hit him in the stomach, although replays appeared to show his arm making contact with it.",
      "Video assistant referee Stuart Attwell checked the incident and took no further action. Hackett, as the former general manager of Professional Game Match Officials Limited (PGMOL), has now weighed in on the decision.",
      "Hackett told Football Insider: \"The referee has to judge if the action by the player is deliberate when deciding that an offence has taken place, not every time the ball comes into contact, is it an offence. There is sufficient doubt in this action not to award a penalty kick.\"",
      "Gary Neville shared at the time his belief that something Martinez did just before the incident stopped a penalty being given. The pundit said during Sky's commentary: After seeing the ball hit Martinez's arm, Neville said: \"There is a massive shout.",
      "\"Schar hits it, his arm is up above his head, and it's stretched. Is it because he's pushing [Malick] Thiaw?",
      "\"That might just save him. He's actually wrestling with the other Newcastle centre-back; his arms are already there.",
      "\"If Thiaw is nowhere near him, that's definitely a penalty. I think the fact that he has just had a wrestle with the other centre-back might just save him.",
      "Neville also offered an insight into what the VAR thought about the incident. \"He is saying the context is because there's another situation whereby he is fighting with another player and his arms are already up there and he's just not got back down.\"",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "The commentator Peter Drury added: \"They are calling it mutual contact between Martinez and Thiaw. And that is essentially the explanation for the fact that there won't be a penalty.\"",
      "Ruben Amorim sung the praises of Martinez after United's victory. He said: \"I think he is a guy with a lot of character. He's really good on the ball, and that came with the quality that he has.",
      "\"He played [in the] World Cup, he won [the] World Cup. He's used to that stress, and he showed today that he's a top player, and sometimes people talk about the way he defends the box because he's a small guy, but today he did really well against a team that just has tall players.\"",
      "However, he stopped short of saying the team would be in a better position if he stayed fitter for longer. Amorim instead replied: \"No, I don't want to say that because if we don't have more points, it's because of the team, not because of a specific player.\"",

      "Following a 1-0 win over Newcastle United on Friday evening thanks to Patrick Dorgu's first-half strike, the Reds currently sit fifth in the Premier League standings A tally of eight wins, five draws and as many losses is what Ruben Amorim's men have to show for their efforts this season, as they look to push for European qualification.",
      "It's a polar opposite state of affairs from the club's 15th-place finish for 2024/25, but further investment may be required next month to ensure a strong end to the current campaign. With the market reopening in a matter of days now, the rumour mill has been churning with regards to both arrivals and departures.",
      "As per Gazzetta, Joshua Zirkzee has had a number of \"discussions and contacts\" with Roma management as of recent, particularly speaking with sporting director, Ricky Massara, and Giallorossi head coach, Gian Piero Gasperini. The publication claim that the Dutch forward has gone as far as \"promising\" himself to Roma by saying 'yes' to a move when the window opens, as it looks increasingly likely that he will make a grand return to Serie A in mid-January, when Bryan Mbeumo, Amad and Noussair Mazraoui return from AFCON.",
      "However, there is a crutch with regards to United agreeing a deal without finding a suitable replacement. While Mbeumo, Benjamin Sesko and Matheus Cunha have all seen the nod ahead of the 24-year-old, Zirkzee has been a valuable option with regards to depth, featuring in 10 Premier League matches this season.",
      "A loan deal with an obligation to buy looks the most likely scenario for Zirkzee come January, should Roma be happy to agree to a fee of around £35million to take the forward on permanently come season's end. With United seemingly looking to strengthen their engine room next month, it will be interesting to see which names crop up as a potential replacement for Zirkzee.",
      "The MEN says: On paper, a deal with Roma would be a fantastic move for all parties involved. Zirkzee set United back a reported £36.5m last summer when he joined from Bologna, but has failed to make much of a mark in the English top flight.",
      "At the time of writing, he has scored just eight goals from 61 appearances - a stark contrast to the 14 from 58 he managed with Bologna - and should Roma agree to a £35m obligation to buy, it will see the Reds recoup most of the money they paid for him last summer to spend elsewhere.",
      "United are among a wealth of clubs who are currently said to be keeping tabs on AZ prospect, Kees Smit. The 19-year-old midfielder has impressed in the Eredivisie, having broken through the youth academy last year.",
      "This season, the Dutch U21 has racked up two goals and two assists from 15 appearances, instrumental in his club's success as they sit sixth in the league standings. And as a result, a number of teams across the world have had their heads turned.",
      "It's no secret that the Reds are looking to strengthen their engine room in January, given Bruno Fernandes has dropped into a deeper role alongside an ageing Casemiro who sees his future with the club beyond 2025/26 cast into speculation.",
      "However, they will face stiff competition in securing his signature from the likes of Chelsea, Bayern Munich, Barcelona, Newcastle United and Real Madrid, to name a few. Furthermore, AZ are understood to hold a valuation of around £52m on the talent at present, which could prove risky considering he is fairly unproven.",
      "The MEN says: It's a major risk to fork out such a substantial sum on a rising prospect, especially given United's track record with regards to splurging on wonderkids as of recent. Zirkzee and Rasmus Hojlund are examples, with neither player truly living up to expectations at Old Trafford despite their reputation.",
      "Instead, the Reds may be better suited tailing a slightly older player with Premier League experience such as Elliot Anderson, considering the centre of the park is make or break in terms of team success.",

      "Manchester United won 1-0 against Newcastle in the Premier League on Boxing Day. United opened the scoring in the 24th minute through a brilliant Patrick Dorgu goal, which was the difference at the break. Newcastle started the second half as the better team and came close to equalising, hitting the crossbar, but United defended bravely to see out a victory, which means they move to fifth in the table. Here are the moments you might have missed....",
      "Amorim sprang a surprise with his system in the 4-4 draw against Bournemouth earlier this month and he tweaked his tactics again on Boxing Day, starting the match with a 4-2-3-1 shape.",
      "The biggest surprise was Dorgu's position, as he started practically on the right wing. The Newcastle analysts in the press box sounded and looked confused as they deliberated among themselves.",
      "Amorim has been wedded to the 3-4-3 formation for most of his tenure, but he is finally tweaking his approach depending on the opponent, which can only be a positive. The United boss has shown a willingness to change, and the reaction from Newcastle's analysts proves why it's worth being adaptable.",
      "Newcastle struggled to get to grips with the shape in the opening exchanges. They eventually adapted and warmed to the contest, but it's encouraging to see Amorim tweaking his tactics game by game.",
      "Amorim altered his system again when he made a double change in the second half. Then Newcastle's analysts were overheard questioning whether Dalot was the right-sided winger. Amorim famously said not even the Pope could persuade him to change his tactics, but that stance has softened.",
      "Dorgu had scored just 12 goals in his career before facing Newcastle, so it's likely his wonderful volley from the edge of the box to fire United into the lead was his finest strike so far.",
      "The Denmark international savoured every second of the celebrations, but he was hungry for more after the restart, demanding the ball from his teammates at every possible opportunity.",
      "Dorgu frantically waved his arms to receive the ball in the 27th minute before looping a shot over the bar. Just moments later, he wildy gestured at Luke Shaw to pass it to him from the opposite wing.",
      "It's funny what confidence can do to a player. Dorgu looked like a new signing and delivered the kind of performance that he must produce consistently to nail down a regular starting role.",
      "Matheus Cunha had an opportunity to extend United's advantage with 10 minutes remaining, but his shot was sent wide of the post at the Stretford End, to the relief of Aaron Ramsdale.",
      "Cunha was slumped on the turf and looked like he had nothing else in the tank. The forward had worked tirelessly throughout the game, and he took his time to get back to his feet.",
      "There were suggestions that Cunha's work rate could be an issue before his arrival from Wolves in the summer transfer window. Some pundits suggested he would not provide adequate defensive cover. Cunha has made that look stupid in just a few months in Manchester - he runs his socks off each game.",
      "Dorgu didn't just contribute in the final third against Newcastle, he worked back and provided defensive cover, which saw him make one of the tackles of the game on Lewis Hall.",
      "It was a brilliant challenge, which provoked a roar from the Stretford End. Dorgu also received appreciation from his teammates. Diogo Dalot slapped his back, and Casemiro pushed him as if to say 'more of that'.",
      "The crowd lapped up Casemiro's interaction. The Brazilian received praise from Amorim during the pre-Newcastle press conference and it will be difficult to find a replacement with a similar mentality next summer, but logic dictates it's the right decision to allow Casemiro to leave after the expiry of his contract.",
      "United included brothers on the bench for the first time in 12 years against Newcastle, with Amorim naming Jack Fletcher and Tyler Fletcher in the squad. Jack was handed his debut against Aston Villa, and he was joined by his twin brother, Tyler, who made his first Premier League matchday squad.",
      "Darren Fletcher, their father, looked proud as punch in the directors' box. It was a special moment to have both brothers in the squad, and the occasion became even sweeter when Jack came onto the pitch.",
      "Mason Mount was brought off at the interval - seemingly due to an injury - and Fletcher was introduced. His father was on his feet and applauding following the final whistle.",

      "Patrick Dorgu has gone full circle at Manchester United this month and Ruben Amorim will now have everything crossed that his first signing for the club can avoid an unwanted suspension. Dorgu, who was a match-winner for United against Newcastle on Boxing Day, is walking a disciplinary tightrope amid his marked improvement.",
      "Dorgu, 21, has four yellow cards to his name this season. Picking up five before the 19-game mark of a term in turn results in a one-match suspension for any Premier League player.",
      "That means Dorgu - and his manager - have 90 anxious minutes to get through against Wolves next up with three teammates unavailable due to AFCON and Bruno Fernandes among those still injured. After being cast aside and publicly criticised by Amorim just a few weeks ago, Dorgu has returned to the line-up with an assist (vs Aston Villa) and goal (vs Newcastle) to help United feel a lot more comfortable without so many options.",
      "\"He needs to be calmer playing the game,\" said Amorim when he was asked about what Dorgu needs to improve. \"You can feel the anxiety every time Patrick touches the ball. I can feel the anxiety.\"",
      "Following that press conference, Dorgu lost his starting place. He was then named on the subs bench for the next five matches, but was recalled against Villa - making his mark in that game and the Newcastle win.",
      "Dorgu spoke with reporters following the full-time whistle vs Newcastle and he was asked how he dealt with the criticism. \"Of course it's never nice to get criticism, but you will always get it as a player,\" he said. \"And you need to react well to it, and I think I've reacted well in the last couple of games.\"",
      "He added: \"The manager spoke about my confidence a few weeks ago. I just looked inside and tried to understand what he meant. And I just tried to build myself up.\"",
      "A sure-fire starter against Wolves (December 30), Dorgu has found a new place in the reshuffled line-up. However, one slip up against the rock-bottom side will see the Denmark man banned for the next Premier League after that, which just happens to be against Leeds.",
      "Amorim will want - and need - to have the former Lecce player available for that trip to Elland Road. He might not have thought that would be the case a few weeks ago.",
      "Recalled out of necessity due to AFCON selection for three others, Dorgu has - at first viewing - taken his chance. The last thing he will now want to do will relinquish his hold on the shirt and present a similar opportunity to other player in Amorim's squad.",
      "Dorgu was signed by Amorim during last season's January transfer window. He cost £30million.",
      "So far in United colours, the wing-back-turned-forward has totted-up 38 matches. The goal against Newcastle was his first for the club, while he also has three assists to show for his efforts.",
      "Dorgu has been capped 12 times by Denmark at senior level. He's under contract at Old Trafford until 2030.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Patrick Dorgu's superb volley midway through the first half proved to be the difference as Ruben Amorim's side secured a precious three points. The Reds were the better side in the first half but came under huge pressure in the second with a resolute rearguard action keeping the visitors out.",
      "Lewis Hall hit the bar for Newcastle, as did Benjamin Sesko for United while Diogo Dalot missed a glorious chance on the counter for the home side. Newcastle were far superior in the second period but lacked quality in the final third and United earned just a second clean sheet of the campaign and a first home win in two months.",
      "Catch up on the action and follow the reaction with us on the blog",
      "A few months ago, Ruben Amorim said even the Pope couldn't convince him to change his system at Manchester United, but on the second day of Christmas, he gave in to popular demand. If a back three is United's past, then could this back four be their future?",
      "Amorim had been teasing the idea of a change of shape in recent weeks and had worked on it in training, so the ghosts of Christmas hadn't visited him in his sleep and brought about an epiphany, yet however it came about, Old Trafford delighted in the reversion to a flat back four and the end of wing-backs.",
      "There is enough material from the past 13 months to give Amorim nightmares, but this change in formation delivered a change in fortunes as well. After six weeks of blowing chance after chance to go fifth in the Premier League, they finally took it. It might last for less than 24 hours, but it shows that this side is in the hunt for a Champions League spot, even if they spent almost the entire second half on the back foot.",
      "Read Tyrone Marshall's on the whistle analysis here",
      "United were pinned back for much of the second half and had to produce a defensive rearguard to hold on to the lead given them before the break.",
      "That goal came from an unlikely source. A half-cleared long throw fell invitingly for Patrick Dorgu, who hit a first-time left-foot volley into the bottom corner from 16 yards.",

      "Sesko can be pleased with his work so far. That was an excellent leap to win a header against Thiaw and start another United attack. He has looked more comfortable leading the line in this shape, as has players around him and is holding the ball up well.",
      "Dorgu is full of confidence and asking for the ball at every single opportunity.",
      "Amorim was just starting to get agitated on the touchline before that goal. United had been on the back foot for a good 10 minutes and were looking ragged. That came out of nowhere, but what a hit it was. Nobody will be anxious when Dorgu is on the ball again anytime soon.",
      "Dorgu has just scored a screamer from the edge of the box to fire United into the lead.",
      "That was an incredible technique to volley and find the bottom left corner.",
      "Newcastle just won a free-kick but that was a strange decision because Ugarte won the ball.",
      "After being caught by surprise due to the system, Newcastle have grown into this game.",
      "Newcastle came close to scoring through a Guimaraes header at a corner.",
      "The Newcastle analysts in the press box have been trying to work out new pressing patterns for United’s unexpected shape. There is a fair bit of shoulder shrugging going on. Nobody expected Dorgu to start on the right wing. Howe and Tindall have been deep in discussions as well, with messages passed on to players who were clearly expecting a more familiar United set-up.",
      "Newcastle's analysts in the press box sound and look confused by how United have lined up tonight.",
      "It was a hybrid back four/back three against Bournemouth but this looks like a back four. Dalot and Shaw the full-backs and Heaven and Martinez in the middle. Dorgu has started very high on the right and is up with Cunha and Sesko at times.",
      "Casemiro had a completely free header in the box but he's unable to get it on target.",
      "It looks like a back four tonight. Dorgu has started high on the right side, similar to where Amad played in the draw against Bournemouth. Amorim is tweaking his tactics due to missing key players."

      "It's going to be a strange experience for Bruno Fernandes on Boxing Day when he sits down to watch Manchester United and is unable to influence the action. Whether Fernandes has his hamstring wrapped up in the warm at home, or has his big coat on at Old Trafford, he isn't going to know what to do with himself when his teammates take on Newcastle United.",
      "Fernandes is 31 and a veteran of 683 appearances for club and country, but astonishingly, he has missed only four games in his career through injury. Two of those were for Portugal in the March 2019 international break and then two for United in May 2024. He has missed two more games due to illness, in 2017 and 2022, and that is it.",
      "It's a remarkable injury record, but one that was unlikely to last as age caught up with the durable Portugal international. The sight of him clutching his hamstring just before half-time at Villa Park on Sunday confirmed Ruben Amorim's worst fears.",
      "Amorim will offer an update on Fernandes' fitness when he holds his pre-Newcastle press conference on Christmas Eve, but he is expected to be absent for around a month. Amorim might also offer a few clues as to how he might replace his captain, although he is arguably irreplaceable.",
      "Fernandes has again been the beating heart of this team this season. Playing slightly ahead of Casemiro, he has 12 goal involvements in 17 Premier League games and set the tone for performances, as he often does.",
      "Amorim has two issues now. How to replace Fernandes in the team and who to hand the captain's armband to. Let's start with the first problem.",
      "In truth, there aren't a lot of options. Kobbie Mainoo will be frustrated that a calf problem has denied him the chance to earn a first start of the season. Amorim has said all season that the 20-year-old is competing for a place with Fernandes, but now he finds himself sitting next to him in the physio's room.",
      "That only leaves Casemiro and Manuel Ugarte. The former will return to the team after serving a suspension on Sunday and perhaps the Uruguayan will keep his place. That would likely mean Casemiro being given the freedom to get forward in the way that Fernandes does.",
      "Amorim ruled out Lisandro Martinez as a regular midfield option last month, but the Argentine looked good there at Villa Park. He is only going to play the holding role, however, and is currently competing with Ugarte for that position.",
      "If Amorim wants a more progressive option, he could turn to 18-year-old Jack Fletcher, who came on for the final 17 minutes on Sunday, or drop Mason Mount back from his position as one of the No. 10s. That would mean Joshua Zirkzee coming in alongside Matheus Cunha. The knock-on effect is that United would have no senior attacking options on the bench.",
      "Amorim will also have to decide who to hand the captain's armband to. It was Diogo Dalot who took it for the second half at Villa and he described that as \"a very proud moment\".",
      "The only game Fernandes hasn't started this season was the Carabao Cup defeat to Grimsby, when Harry Maguire was skipper, but Maguire is now absent with a thigh problem. In the Premier League, the last time Fernandes didn't start was at Brentford in May, when Luke Shaw was captain. Maguire and Diogo Dalot were also missing that day as focus turned to the Europa League.",
      "At Wolves, a couple of weeks earlier, it was the now departed Victor Lindelof who captained United. The only other time Fernandes didn't start in the league last season was against Newcastle nearly a year ago, when Lisandro Martinez wore the armband. That's four different captains in four Premier League games without Fernandes in 2024/25.",
      "The fact that Dalot was captain while Shaw and Martinez were on the pitch would suggest he is now ahead of them. He is in the six-man leadership group named in the summer, alongside Fernandes, Tom Heaton, Noussair Mazraoui, Martinez and Maguire. Of that six, Dalot is the only guaranteed starter on Boxing Day and the only other player from that group who could feature is Martinez.",
      "Casemiro was suspended against Aston Villa but has some leadership experience. He has captained Brazil on 18 occasions, although never skippered Real Madrid. He has worn the armband twice from the off against United, in a 4-0 Premier League defeat to Crystal Palace and a 3-0 Carabao Cup loss to Newcastle.",
      "So everything points to Dalot getting the captaincy in Fernandes' absence. Who replaces him in midfield might be a little trickier.",

      "Welcome along to our latest Manchester United question and answer session with senior club writer Tyrone Marshall, who covers the daily goings-on at Old Trafford.",
      "It's been another busy week in M16. A 4-4 draw with Bournemouth last week, a 2-1 defeat to Aston Villa on Sunday, speculation around the future of Kobbie Mainoo and an injury for Bruno Fernandes, not to mention attempts to sign Antoine Semenyo.",
      "We asked for questions and you delivered. The responses to those submitted are below. We will be running weekly question and answer sessions from now, so keep an eye on our social media feeds and get your questions in as we seek to keep you plugged in to everything going on at Old Trafford.",
      "Appreciating that we don't want to completely undermine the summer budget, how feasible is it that we could trigger Semenyo's release clause and still look at a loan-with-an-option deal for someone like Conor Gallagher?",
      "From a budget point of view, I think that would be doable. The question is whether they want someone like Conor Gallagher. The noise coming out of United is that they will only move for long-term targets next month, which essentially means bringing forward a deal for someone they had lined up in the summer.",
      "Semenyo ticks that box. They looked at him earlier this year, remained interested and would have waited until next summer but for the fact that his release clause meant there was suddenly a queue for him. I believe his release clause might be smaller in the summer, but nobody can afford to wait now.",
      "I don't see United being able to get the calibre of midfielder they want in the summer on loan this winter. Someone like Gallagher or Ruben Neves might tick a box as a short-term, emergency option, but even Ruben Amorim said on Sunday they were keen to avoid making mistakes and would rather suffer short-term pain than make a transfer mistake.",
      "When will the manager give more of the young players a chance instead of buying expensive flops?",
      "To be fair to Amorim, he has given young players a go. As he pointed out, Toby Collyer, Harry Amass and Chido Obi got chances last season. I don't think any of them could say they have been harshly treated.",
      "Collyer has had injury issues since, and Amass is doing well at a struggling Sheffield Wednesday. He will come on for the experience but I don't think anyone thinks he's ready for first-team football at Old Trafford. Chido struggled to influence first-team games last term and isn't exactly knocking the door down now.",
      "There are question marks over how many players at academy level are ready to step up and I don't think Amorim is alone in having doubts. United have made costly mistakes in the market in recent years, but under Amorim, their record looks to have improved.",
      "Senne Lammens looks like a solid signing and Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha look like very good deals. Benjamin Sesko has had a slow start, but there have been flashes of quality.",
      "Fans always want to see young players, especially when a team is struggling, but I don't think the answer lies in youth at the moment.",
      "When was the last time United made a profit from selling a player they had bought? They always seem to take heavy losses when selling \" flops\".",
      "I think the clue is in the question. If you are selling a flop, you aren't going to make a profit on him. It goes without saying that a player's value will have shrunk if they have been a disappointment since signing.",
      "I often think the discourse around United's ability to sell players is a little overplayed. They could certainly get better at it, but Manchester United aren't a selling club. There are usually only two reasons for United to sell, A) that player isn't good enough for the club, or B) they want to move elsewhere (such as Cristiano Ronaldo).",
      "It isn't always that clear-cut, of course, but let's look at a couple of recent departures. Antony and Aaron Wan-Bissaka were poor signings who were never likely to live up to their price tag. That is a failure of recruitment rather than selling.",
      "Aside from academy graduates, one of the last players United made a profit on was Daniel James, but that was always a weird deal. He was never likely to make the grade, improved a little and was 'flipped' for a profit. That is what you expect of Brighton or Brentford, not Manchester United.",
      "Manchester United should not go for a defensive midfielder in this January transfer window. But if we can get the Antoine Semenyo deal done, then it will be considered a good window.",
      "I think if United finish this window with just Semenyo, then it will be a good month. There is fierce competition for his signature but he would follow the trend of Cunha and Mbeumo as Premier League-proven players ready to 'plug and play' under Amorim, even if he ends up playing left wing-back.",
      "There is a concern at the lack of options in midfield and it feels like all four midfielders have question marks over their futures beyond the summer, but United are determined not to panic. They are planning a midfield rebuild in 2026 and it might have to wait until the summer, when we can expect similar sums to the £200m+ spent on forwards in 2025 to be splashed on midfielders.",
      "Did United receive any compensation from the FA for Luke Shaw being injured for months after ridiculously playing for England at the Euros?",
      "FIFA's Club Protection Programme covers the salary of anyone injured on international duty. They must be out for a period of at least 28 consecutive days and the scheme is capped at €7.5million.",
      "However, Luke Shaw was not injured on international duty in 2024. You could argue he rushed back to play for England, having missed the last three months of the season for United, but which professional footballer wouldn't want to play in a major tournament final for their country?",
      "It's worth remembering that Shaw played the full 90 minutes in England's Euro 2024 final against Spain. He played 42 minutes against Switzerland in the quarter-finals and 45 minutes against the Netherlands in the semi-final. He returned to pre-season training at Carrington on time.",
      "It was while wearing United training kit that he picked up another injury. Maybe that was due to the efforts made to get fit for England, but we can't be sure. What we can say is that those problems look to be a thing of the past and his fitness record this season has been exceptional.",

      "How do you solve a problem like Bruno? In a week when Manchester United had to consider the possibility of losing their best player after his unexpected comments about his future, they are about to get a taste of what life without Fernandes might actually be like.",
      "The 31-year-old reckons United's powerbrokers wanted to sell him last summer but lacked the \"courage\" to go through with it. His performances this season have once again made him indispensable, but after picking up a hamstring injury at Aston Villa, he now faces a spell on the sidelines.",
      "What are the patterns they can take from those four defeats? These are the games and what sticks out from a Fernandes-less United.",
      "Fernandes wasn't really missing back in May. He was at the Gtech Community Stadium, but spent the whole game sat on the bench. It summed up how United's focus had turned away from the Premier League and towards the Europa League.",
      "Amorim's selection shows how priorities had changed and maybe this game belongs in a category of its own. There were starts for Tyler Fredricson, Harry Amass and Chido Obi. United added gloss to the scoreline but were 4-1 down with eight minutes to go. Mason Mount, Alejandro Garnacho and Amad got the goals and only one of that trio will be available on Boxing Day.",
      "With Fernandes absent, it was Kobbie Mainoo who played next to Manuel Ugarte, another option that is off the table against Newcastle. Amad came on at half-time and he and Garnacho provided some spark to the attack, but that won't be possible now.",
      "Maybe the most relevant game of them all, given Newcastle will be the first opponents United confront without Fernandes. The captain was suspended after being sent off against Wolves, and this was a grim day nobody wants to remember.",
      "Newcastle were 2-0 up inside 20 minutes and it felt like they declared after that. Joshua Zirkzee was hooked after 33 minutes and booed off. Casemiro was given such a run around that it felt like it might be the end for him at Old Trafford.",
      "United mustered just one shot on target as they lost for the fourth game in a row. \"It is a really difficult moment, one of the more difficult moments in the history of Manchester United and we have to address it with honesty,\" Amorim said after the game.",
      "On this occasion, it was Casemiro and Christian Eriksen in midfield, but the ageing duo were run ragged by Sandro Tonali, Joelinton and Bruno Guimaraes. That trio will be licking their lips at the chance to inflict more damage on the United midfield.",
      "The second of two successive games that Fernandes missed with a knee injury. This time, United managed two shots on target and were comfortably held at bay by an Arsenal side still pushing for the title.",
      "United went into the game with a midfield trio of Sofyan Amrabat, Mainoo and Scott McTominay, while Erik ten Hag finally handed a chance to Amad. That is at least something to emerge from the wreckage of the defeats without Fernandes.",
      "There was a lack of creativity on show and with injuries forcing Ten Hag to field Jonny Evans and Casemiro together in the centre of defence, United did well to keep the score down to one.",
      "That was a marked improvement from what happened at Selhurst Park six days earlier. This was a defeat that should have sounded the death knell for the Ten Hag era.",
      "United were ripped to shreds in South London, when Palace had four goals by the 66th minute and could have easily had more. It remains one of the worst nights in the post-Sir Alex Ferguson era, which is saying something.",
      "Palace racked up 10 shots on target to a pitiful two for United, who played with no intensity or imagination. A midfield of Mainoo, Eriksen and Mount might look good on paper, but they were trampled all over.",
      "Ten Hag insisted after the game that \"I will keep fighting\" and somehow United beat Manchester City in the FA Cup final a few weeks later. Thankfully, Fernandes was fit for that one.",
      "Four games without Fernandes and four defeats. Three of them without scoring, and two of them scoring highly on the embarrassment scale. It doesn't bode well.",
      "United managed 10 shots on target in those four games, but half of those were in the chaotic game at Brentford, which had a significant end-of-season vibe.",
      "Across those four games, United created an expected goals (xG) tally of 3.2, of which around half came at Brentford. Fernandes might be playing a deeper role, but he is still miles clear when it comes to creating chances and in his absence, it's pretty clear that there will be fewer opportunities, which is going to put a premium on taking them.",

      "If Manchester United need an example of a January transfer deal that turned out to be a success, then they only need to look at the captain they are now dreading being without for a week. Bruno Fernandes arrived in January 2020 and is the best signing the club have made in any transfer window for a long, long time.",
      "Those sorts of success stories can be few and far between, but the secret to success in the mid-season market is not to get blown off course. The deals that turn out to be good ones are usually a case of a club fulfilling a long-standing interest in a player, rather than rushing into short-term or panicked deals.",
      "Far too often, United's recent January business has tended towards the latter. The jury is open on last season's mid-season window dealings. Ayden Heaven had a good start to his United career but still has plenty to learn and after a shaky spell, Patrick Dorgu was much improved when returning to the team against Aston Villa on Sunday.",
      "Maybe, in time, those will look like January steals, although United were shopping in the sales a year ago, so tight was their precarious financial situation. The purse strings are a little looser now and a £65million deal for Antoine Semenyo would fit the Fernandes mould. He is a player they have long admired and are making a move now because he is set to leave Bournemouth next month.",
      "But that was not the case when loan moves were made for Wout Weghorst and Marcel Sabitzer in the winter of 2023, or Odion Ighalo in 2020. They might have been loans, but they don't come without a cost and all of them speak to poor squad planning.",
      "Amorim was asked about January plans at Villa Park, in the wake of seeing his captain go off injured, an extremely rare sight in the career of Fernandes, who has missed two games in nearly six years at Old Trafford. His answer might have disappointed fans desperate for a raft of activity next month, but it was sensible and reassuring for those keen to see a new outlook on recruitment.",
      "\"What we cannot do is to reach January and try to do everything in urgency and make mistakes,\" he said. \"And then here we go again with a lot of mistakes. I'm not going to get with Jason [Wilcox] and Omar [Berrada] and I'm going to say we need a lot of players because we have a plan.",
      "\"If we have to suffer, the club comes first. Of course, we are in the moment that we need points, but we need to find solutions and we are going to continue with our plan. Of course, you can feel that in this moment we are going to struggle, but we'll see.\"",
      "We've seen plans change before, but it certainly sounds like Amorim is determined not to go down the short-term fix route. His reference to the mistakes of the past is accurate and those deals have got United nowhere. Loan moves in the middle of the season are unlikely to significantly enhance the quality of this squad.",
      "Amorim would rather face short-term pain, whether that be turning to the academy or getting creative with his squad, such as fielding Lisandro Martinez in midfield. The risk is that it compromises the ambition of qualifying for the Champions League, but then who could add enough quality to strengthen that aim next month, without breaking the bank?",
      "Maybe United will suffer for a little while. Amorim is banking that in the long run, focusing finances on targets that really will add quality will pay off. It sounds like a sensible strategy.",

      "Sunday, December 21, 2025, will forever be a special day for Jack Fletcher and Shea Lacey, regardless of Manchester United's defeat at Aston Villa. The 18-year-olds will never forget their professional debuts, especially coming for United on a big Premier League stage.",
      "It's an interesting time for two academy graduates to be adding their names to a historic list of youngsters making the step up to the first team as well. Ruben Amorim threw them both on at Villa Park with resources stretched to breaking point, and he did so having been critical of the academy in recent weeks.",
      "The relationship between Amorim and those nurturing the stars of the future could be strained after recent comments, with the head coach not always giving the impression he was happy with the quality or the attitude of those being developed.",
      "However, in the West Midlands, he demonstrated that he was still willing to turn to them when needed. Fletcher came on with 17 minutes remaining and Lacey got the final six minutes, having been an unused substitute on four occasions recently. Both can be happy with their brief cameos.",
      "There could be more opportunities to come. Casemiro will return on Boxing Day, but United will be without seven first-team players, with Noussair Mazraoui, Harry Maguire, Matthijs de Ligt, Amad, Kobbie Mainoo, Bruno Fernandes and Bryan Mbeumo all set to be out. That could hand more squad places to academy kids.",
      "As good as Fletcher and Lacey might be feeling this morning, however, they have been warned that making their debuts is far from the end of the road and after Amorim's recent comments, they will know hard times could be ahead as well. Even for the best players, the path is very rarely smooth.",
      "That is the point Amorim made a week ago when he cited the debuts handed out to Harry Amass and Chido Obi last season, who played for United at the ages of 18 and 17, but now find themselves going through different periods. Amass is playing well for a struggling Championship side and Chido is having a more difficult season at academy level.",
      "Both players reacted badly to those comments, posting photos on Instagram of successful moments in recent months, only to then delete them. Amorim was unflinching in his criticism last week, but made the valid point that it can be dangerous to cosset young players and that sometimes they need to go through tougher spells as part of their development.",
      "\"Sometimes strong words is not bad words. Sometimes difficult moments is not a bad thing for the kids,\" he said. \"We don’t need to be always with accolades in everything, in every situation. We are not helping.\"",
      "Those are words that Fletcher and Lacey should remember. A month from now, the injured players are likely to return, and the Africa Cup of Nations trio of Mazraoui, Amad, and Mbeumo will be back. With a fully fit squad to pick from, Amorim won't be calling on Fletcher or Lacey.",
      "They have had a taste of first-team football for one of the world's biggest clubs, but very soon they will be playing academy football again or having a loan spell in the EFL. When that happens, they should take Amorim's comments on board. They have enjoyed a memorable day in their young careers, but the hard work has barely even begun.",

      "Manchester United boss Ruben Amorim defended Leny Yoro, Ayden Heaven and Benjamin Sesko after the team's 2-1 defeat to Aston Villa. United left Birmingham empty-handed on Sunday following two goals from Morgan Rogers.",
      "Yoro gave Rogers yards of space for the opening goal of the game, and he was at the scene of the crime again when the in-form England international fired his side back into the lead. Heaven was tested against the experienced Ollie Watkins, while Sesko missed two chances in quick succession in the first half on his first start since recovering from a knee injury.",
      "Discussing Sesko in his post-match press conference, Amorim said: \"He is returning to competition, really fast, he is going to improve a lot, the idea was 70-75 [minutes], he stopped for a while, we are trying to help the players.\"",
      "When discussing whether United conceded similar goals at Villa Park, Amorim defended Yoro and Heaven, saying: \"Sometimes we can suffer goals and concede. When you want to press and they kick the ball, Rogers can go both sides, it is really hard to defend a player like that one against one.",
      "\"We had some games against Nottingham Forest, Ayden [Heaven] and Leny [Yoro] defend one against one most of the time, Luke Shaw is the same. It is not just if you suffer goals, but the way. Sometimes the details can change the narrative.\"",
      "United had the opportunity to move up to fifth in the table with a victory against Villa, but they will head into the Boxing Day game against Newcastle sitting in seventh position in the league.",
      "Amorim will be without Bruno Fernandes, who picked up a muscle injury in the first half of the game. \"I think it's soft tissue so it's going to be a while. We'll see,\" the United boss said.",
      "When asked whether Kobbie Mainoo could return to face Newcastle, he added: \"Kobbie Mainoo is out, Bruno is out, so we'll see. No excuses, we'll try to win the next game.\"",

      "Manchester United are unlikely to sanction a January departure for Joshua Zirkzee until their injury crisis has eased or key players have returned from the Africa Cup of Nations. Roma are keen to sign the forward next month as Gian Piero Gasperini looks to strengthen his attacking options.",
      "A deal isn't thought to be as advanced as reports in Italy have suggested over the previous 24 hours, but the Serie A giants are keen to sign Zirkzee during the window as they explore a loan or permanent deal. Even if a move was to accelerate, United are reluctant to lose an attacking option at a point when their resources are so stretched. Zirkzee came on for the final 17 minutes against Aston Villa on Sunday.",
      "United lost Kobbie Mainoo to a calf injury in training on Saturday and then saw Bruno Fernandes limp off at half-time at Villa Park. Both players will miss the Boxing Day clash against Newcastle and while there is hope Mainoo could be fit for the clash with Wolves, Ruben Amorim expects Fernandes to miss a few games.",
      "That is a blow when he is already without attacking options in Amad and Bryan Mbeumo, who are away with the Ivory Coast and Cameroon at the Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON). It means the only true attacking options available to Amorim are Zirkzee, Mason Mount, Matheus Cunha and Benjamin Sesko.",
      "Amad and Mbeumo's absence will depend on how far their nations get in AFCON, but they are both among the favourites and the final weekend of the tournament is played on January 17 and 18. Amorim will give an update on Fernandes' fitness at his press conference on Christmas Eve to preview the clash with Newcastle.",
      "United are working on an attacking signing in January as they eye up a move for Antoine Semenyo. The Bournemouth forward has a £65million release clause in his contract, but United face competition from Manchester City and Liverpool for the 25-year-old.",
      "That clause is only active in the first couple of weeks of the window, so any deal could happen quickly. Should United land Semenyo, it could also free up the possibility of Zirkzee then joining Roma.",
      "Zirkzee, 24, has struggled to make an impression at Old Trafford since his £36.5million move from Bologna in July 2024. He has managed just eight goals and three assists in 60 games for the club and has started just 17 Premier League games.",

      "Senne Lammens wore a polo shirt and a navy sweatshirt when he visited Old Trafford after signing for Manchester United. The young goalkeeper looked as though he could be joining United to work in their HR department.",
      "The same observation was made when Lammens reported for international duty with Belgium last week - the 23-year-old was dressed in a beige collared jacket, a khaki t-shirt and chinos.",
      "\"By accident, I saw an article saying he was wearing something boring when he reported for international duty and fans saying they hoped he stays like this,\" laughed Hayk Milkon, one of Lammens' former coaches.",
      "\"This 'boringness' is just the way Senne is, he's really calm and no excesses. He focuses on what he needs to focus on and is open with the people around him. He keeps his feet on the ground.\"",
      "If Lammens looks like someone who could work in an office, every workplace would love to have him in their five-a-side team. United believe they have signed a young goalkeeper with huge potential, and fans who were present at Old Trafford against Sunderland left the stadium buzzing about his debut.",
      "The quirk is that Lammens appears to be a different person when he wears his goalkeeper kit. He made a supremely confident United debut, aggressively commanded his area and kept a clean sheet.",
      "Milkon coached Lammens during their time together at Club Brugge. Milkon is now the youngest manager in the Belgian top-flight and Lammens plays for the biggest club in England.",
      "\"It was Senne with his headphones on. He would go into the gym to do his recovery or some extra top-ups. Or he would just go to relax by playing basketball - he loved to play basketball.\"",
      "Milkon coached in different roles at Club Brugge. He was the assistant of Club NXT (their reserve team), served as their interim manager, was in charge of the Under-18s and eventually became a first-team coach.",
      "His time at Club Brugge coincided with Lammens progressing from the academy to their first team, so he is uniquely positioned to provide insight into United's new goalkeeper signing.",
      "Lammens joined Club Brugge's academy when he was 12. \"He was a guy with huge potential,\" said Milkon. \"As I learned from colleagues who had worked with him when he was much younger, I heard there was a moment that clicked in his head when he became super professional.",
      "\"He was one of the guys during Covid - when the players were not able to train - who was doing a lot at home, he was really going far with this to be the best in these types of areas.",
      "\"Then he continued like this when he joined the first team to train with them. He always wanted to improve. We also had something in place to look at the parameters on which goalkeepers are judged.",
      "\"You see the potential of the goalkeeper based on what they do in games; so their positioning, their decision-making and so on, and Senne was always quite high in these areas.",
      "\"The only bad luck that he had was that the first-team goalkeeper was Simon Mignolet. He's an amazing goalkeeper, so it was difficult for Senne to stay over there in the role of No.2.",
      "\"That would have also blocked his growth, so it was good for him in the end to make the step to go to Antwerp and he did a tremendous job there. It was amazing to see how fast he adapted.\"",
      "Milkon continued: \"I think for us at Club Brugge, it was very clear to everyone that Senne was a top goalkeeper. He would have been the perfect fit for Club Brugge to be the No.1.",
      "\"That was not possible because Mignolet was there. But the parameters that we used to judge his performances indicated he was ticking so many boxes already, and he was consistently doing it.",
      "\"There weren't ups and downs with his performances. He was consistently really high and when you compare this to the top goalkeepers, you have a benchmark to say 'Ok, what potential does this guy have?'",
      "\"He had some chances with the first team at Club Brugge and made a mistake, or maybe two, but in the end it was very clear to everyone that he was a top goalkeeper.",
      "\"It was impossible to try to extend his contract because, again, you have Mignolet, and you cannot block a guy like this. You know he has to go out, he has to play, and he will improve even more.\"",
      "When asked about Lammens' strengths, he said: \"I would say that his decision-making was very good. He is very calm, he sees the solutions on the pitch, he has a quick reaction time and understands the balance between risk and reward, and which decisions are the right ones to make.",
      "\"His clean passing is great, his footwork was really good, and he's just an amazing goalkeeper with the shot-stopping. He made some incredible saves back then already. He's quite a complete goalkeeper.",
      "\"But making the right decisions at a very young age, being very mature with this, was really impressive. And the fact that he is good with both feet is another big strength.",
      "\"For me, Senne is a very calm guy and has all the qualities to be a top professional. That was my impression when I first met him when he was younger and he never changed.\"",
      "Lammens joined Royal Antwerp on a free transfer in the summer of 2023. He was handed his debut a few months later and served as an understudy that season, but earned first-choice status for 2024/2025.",
      "His performances drew attention from the Belgian media. Lammens saved four penalties across a successful first full campaign and received a call-up to Belgium's senior squad in March.",
      "Milkon said: \"I was not surprised when I saw Manchester United had come calling. And to record his first clean sheet, I was really happy for him. Senne is a potential No.1 for the Red Devils - the Belgium national team.",
      "\"He got his chance, he took it, and we're all really proud of him, but we knew it would happen. I believe he has all the capabilities to become the best in the world, so I wish him all the best. I'm sure he will have a very good career in England, and Manchester United should return to the big club they used to be.",

      "\"For me, it was just having a tiny little part in having an influence on him at Brugge, but it was the most positive memories of our relationship that we had during this spell.",
      "\"I'm very proud that he is reaching these high levels and not surprised. I believe he will be successful because he is a guy who will not change his focus or start to do something different. He is calm, that's his personality and character, and he wants to succeed. He is hungry and will keep working to be his best.",
      "\"He is so calm, and you have to be patient in football. You cannot worry too much and want things too early, but finding the balance between not being impatient and, at the same time, pushing and demanding what you deserve in a good way, means everything will sort itself out.\"",
      "United staff who have worked with Lammens at Carrington have echoed Milkon's sentiments. He has been described as \"really mature for his age\" and is said to have taken the move in his stride.",
      "Lammens is understood to have impressed coaches during training sessions and a United source said that lots of people have been speaking positively about him. He has already relocated from the luxury hotel where he was initially staying and into a house.",
      "It's no surprise that Lammens likes to play basketball at 6ft 3in, but he is a keen golfer, which is common ground with the likes of Tom Heaton, Luke Shaw, Mason Mount and Harry Maguire.",

      "We’re so back. The 25/26 Premier League season is rattling along now, with a familiar name already roaring into a significant lead in the race for the Golden Boot.",
      "Erling Haaland is bidding to reclaim his crown after he and everyone else got Mo Salahed last season, and it’s so far so good with the Big Norwegian currently boasting a whopping  lead over his nearest yet also very distant challengers.",
      "Here are the actual 10 current favourites for the big shiny shoe, according to oddschecker.com, with each player’s current goal tally in brackets.",
      "",
      "Has regained his lost scoring touch in recent weeks.",
      "",
      "Another very solid return for one of the Premier League’s most reliable strikers.",
      "",
      "A wonderfully chaotic option for Spurs and a man seemingly doomed forever to score spectacularly memorable goals in spectacularly memorable disasters. Which is really just unimprovably Tottenham of him.",
      "",
      "Well look at that: An actual Manchester United player scoring actual Premier League goals. He’s not going to win, obviously, but even making it into the top 10 feels like some kind of achievement.",
      "",
      "The Proper Striker to finally deliver the title to Arsenal? Not on the evidence of that opening-day performance v Man Utd or the first half against Leeds but definitely possibly of the second half. There was no sign of him adding to that total v Liverpool but he did score v Nottingham Forest and Burnley.",
      "Arsenal’s title challenge is in textbook shape, but there hasn’t been that much contribution from the striker they apparently needed to drag them over the line.",
      "",
      "Given he was the wrong profile of striker for Newcastle entirely, bought in a performative panic after everyone else had said no, and given that Newcastle haven’t really been any good this season, it’s to Woltemade’s huge credit that he’s escaped a seemingly certain floppy fate. But he’s not going to win the Golden Boot, is he?",
      "",
      "We’ve given ourselves a headache trying to work out whether his imminent move to Man City makes him more or less likely to somehow reel in Haaland. Probably moot. But a fine player having a fine player and about to reap the rewards.",
      "",
      "Surely the man best placed if something horrendous were to befall Haaland as he has actually scored a whole lot of Premier League goals. How the f*** do Brentford keep pulling this off?",
      "",
      "Has been impressive in a Liverpool team that has not, and Alexander Isak’s unfortunate injury does rather clear a path for a player already outperforming his more expensively-acquired team-mate.",
      "",
      "Looking to reclaim his crown after last season’s ‘struggles’ and made – as he generally does – a rapid start to the season with a couple of goals on the opening day as the familiar focal point of a new-look Man City side. It’s an absurd lead at this stage, really, with his own nonsense compounded by none of the other most likely contenders – with all due respect to your Semenyos and Thiagos – doing anything all that compelling to challenge him.",
      "We certainly didn’t expect everything that football has thrown at us in 2025, but there has been enough entirely predictable stuff to keep us sane.",
      "Mo Salah was the hero once again after he netted in stoppage time and here’s how the International media reacted to it.",
      "It would be an “amazing achievement” if Liverpool could “clear £50-75m” for Mohamed Salah, according to one football finance expert.",
      "Erling Haaland “could ultimately be the difference” in the title race as he is levels above Viktor Gyokeres, says Captain Obvious Gary Lineker.",
      "According to reports, Liverpool and Mohamed Salah have reached an ‘agreement’ regarding a transfer as they have settled on a ‘new exit plan’.",
      "Erling Haaland has been a Premier League player for barely three seasons but has already outscored a legion of legends and is firing Norway to the World Cup."

      "There is some significant jostling for position going on now behind what remain a pair of pretty clear market leaders.",
      "Arne Slot has had a few wins to get him out of immediate Mo Salah-instigated danger, but Newcastle’s failure to launch this season, West Ham’s inability to drag themselves out of the bottom three, and Enzo Maresca’s self-fulfilling title race predictions are all causing market moves.",
      "Meanwhile, here are possible replacement managers currently between jobs.",
      "",
      "An earlier version of this oft-updated piece speculated on what might happen to Mikel Arteta should Arsenal suffer from their Nightmare Start. What if they lost a few early games? What then? We concluded this:",
      "It’s far likelier that Arsenal emerge blinking into the autumn sunshine broadly unscathed from their nightmare horrors. No denying that this season does represent one in which Arteta might completely lose the plot and go entirely off the rails. Or the one where he wins the league by 10 points. Feels like we’re odds-on to get one or the other.",
      "Arsenal emerged duly unscathed, and have already cashed in on the shift to easier fixtures of their own alongside much tougher ones for Liverpool to take top spot in the Premier League.",
      "Only question that remains, therefore, is what Arsenal do from here. We are absolutely certain that it either involves p*ssing the league by 10 points or a complete and total meltdown. Nothing in between is acceptable or even conceivable. Both options now appear gloriously possible.",
      "READ: Who will be the next manager of Arsenal if Mikel Arteta is sacked?",
      "",
      "Doing so well that even suffering the ultimate embarrassment of defeat at Old Trafford hasn’t dampened spirits for the most impressive promoted club in quite some time.",
      "Six wins in the bag already and comfortably more points than Southampton managed in the entirety of 24/25. Widespread expectation that tougher games would bring Sunderland back down with a bump have thus far proved wide of the mark; there won’t be many teams unhappy at taking four points from two games against Chelsea and Arsenal this season. The comeback victory over Bournemouth was evidence, if indeed it was still required, that Sunderland are proper.",
      "Victory over Newcastle on derby day has us firmly into ‘manager of the year’ territory for one of the big pre-season Sack Race favourites.",
      "",
      "Extraordinary season for Emery already. Began the campaign right at the outside of this market with your Artetas and – unlikely as it now sounds – Slots. Then jumped right up to third favourite when Villa’s rankling disappointment at how last season ended leaked into a six-match winless start to this campaign.",
      "But then along came four Premier League wins in a row to thoroughly lift the mood at a club where a few short weeks earlier it really did feel like they’d come to the end of something special without ever getting the definitive moment of success it deserved.",
      "That run is now 12 wins in 13 Premier League games and has lifted Villa right through the mid-table slop, then into the top four, and now genuine title contention. Four wins in five games have a distinctly winnable Europa League campaign bubbling along nicely, too. An astonishing shift from what felt like an inexorable downward spiral not that long ago.",
      "We could all learn something from that, but we won’t.",
      "",
      "A sacking remains out of the question despite last season’s (relative) struggles. There hasn’t been a Premier League manager since Fergie in his pomp with more credit in the bank than Pep.",
      "But is there still a distinct chance Guardiola decides he’s had enough and simply walks away? We reckon there is as they eye ‘two’ alternatives, and it’s always worth remembering that we’re talking Next Premier League Manager To Leave here, and that the traditional ‘Sack Race’ shorthand is a bit misleading.",
      "Still, though. Almost no chance at this point that any of that could happen swiftly enough for nobody else to have been canned first. Especially as they now somehow find themselves within two points of Arsenal despite not really playing convincingly well for quite some time now.",
      "",
      "",
      "",
      "Fine end to 24/25 put a different complexion on Brighton’s season than at one time appeared likely. Ending up a clear best of the rest outside the quickly established top seven represented at least a passing grade and they’d have to make a truly awful start to the season to get in any kind of managerial-change bother.",
      "The win over Newcastle to go with victory at Chelsea to go with a win over City reaffirms Brighton’s big-boy-bothering calibre, but does also make some of their other results – draws with Fulham and Wolves and West Ham, for instance – a bit annoying.",
      "",
      "Sounds preposterous, but there really is a non-zero chance Moyes gets punished for easing Everton’s immediate relegation fears and they seek some more enterprising football from a squad that is, in fairness, capable of that as climbing into the top six demonstrates. Does feel like a very familiar Everton story, though, and one that ends with them 16th, chastened, and bringing in another firefighter.",
      "",
      "The continuity candidate in the summer, and looked to have received the ultimate hospital pass. How much continuity could there be at Brentford given they’d sold Bryan Mbeumo, Yoane Wissa and Christian Norgaard, while Thomas Frank took most of the remaining coaching staff with him to Tottenham? It was a very Brentford move to promote from within and we’ll hold our hands up and admit we thought it would go far, far worse than it has.",
      "With Newcastle added to Liverpool and Manchester United on the list of Gtech victims this season, it’s an undeniably impressive start in trying circumstances.",
      "",
      "Has done more than could ever have been expected given the chaos he walked into. That epic pants-pulling at Anfield surely leaves Dyche as safe as any manager ever can be in Mr Marinakis’ lair. Were oddly rubbish against Brighton and easily beaten by Everton, but spangling Tottenham will have gone down enormously well with his boss for sure.",
      "",
      "Still among the least sackable managers in the top flight despite Bournemouth now being in the depths of one of the familiar lows that have always existed alongside the highs under Iraola.",
      "A streaky manager of a streaky team, but he must still be in credit overall given the prognostications of doom when he had to sell pretty much his entire defence in the summer. It’s hurting him and Bournemouth now but they still – for now, just about – remain outside the real relegation scrap and that’s impressive enough on the back of such a challenging summer.",
      "But could really, really do with starting another of the ‘Champions League form’ runs quite soon.",
      "",
      "Backed in to a hot favourite as the whispers began before the international break. But just when we thought it might be time to accept something is fundamentally broken here as a relegation fight bubbled up, an impressive win over Sunderland and a restorative visit to Dr Tottenham have sorted things out.",
      "Victory at Burnley has made it three wins from four, lifted Fulham away from the relegation battle and towards the mid-table strivers, and significantly lessened the real risk that he or Fulham might do something they live to regret.",
      "",
      "Won’t be sacked, obviously, because Palace are absolutely punching with an elite-level manager who is quietly delivering astonishing results in trying circumstances.",
      "But with reports he was willing and ready to walk out if Marc Guehi was sold without a replacement point to new strains on a relationship that is bound to be tested in the weeks and months ahead.",
      "Nailed it in the Community Shield, but as ever for clubs on Palace’s level there’s a positive-and-negative scale to be balanced by your manager catching the eye so conspicuously. Glasner absolutely could be poached with bigger beasts surely paying attention to the work he’s done at Selhurst Park.",
      "And if that poaching comes from outside the Premier League, then it comes with the possibility of making Glasner the next Premier League managerial casualty. But still very unlikely.",
      "We’d imagine the significant lowering of the threat level for a Ruben Amorim Sack at United eased some nerves at Selhurst Park, but the significant raising of the threat level for an Arne Slot Sack at Liverpool or even Thomas Frank Sack at Spurs has them looking a bit nervous once more. For more than one reason, it’s vital Palace don’t lose Glasner to someone as ropey as Spurs.",
      "",
      "Time to stop trying to work out if Man United are good or rubbish. They’re just meh. Arguably that’s even worse, really, when This Is Manchester United Football Club We’re Talking About. But trying to look for clues in the tea-leaves of their results is completely futile when they do things like win three games in a row and then come unstuck at Nottingham Forest or fail even to win at Tottenham like literally everyone else even vaguely competent is able to do at the moment.",
      "Losing at home to 10-man Everton and then winning from a goal down at Crystal Palace just highlights the pointlessness of trying to read anything into what Manchester United are doing. It’s just a bunch of stuff that happens. We do now have the potential novelty for a bit of that stuff being stuff that happens without Bruno Fernandes. But still: just stuff.",
      "What does that mean for Ruben Amorim? That he’s probably fine. They’re definitely less bad than they once were, and he wasn’t sacked then. So probably won’t be now.",
      "",
      "Impossible to avoid the conclusion that Slot’s reaction to Liverpool’s mini-crisis becoming actual-crisis was poor. He went Full Klopp with his salty loser behaviour when Manchester United committed the crime of altering their tactics to give themselves the best chance of success against Liverpool, and the headloss continued after another chaotic and unstructured performance led to a 3-2 defeat at Brentford.",
      "Having ticked ‘opposition doing tactics wrong’ off his rattled manager bingo card, he can now add ‘losing his mind over entirely uncontroversial refereeing decisions’ with his response to both the Cody Gakpo non-penalty and Virgil van Dijk penalty at the Gtech.",
      "It has to be a worry for Liverpool that Slot has for the first time in his Anfield career found himself under any kind of pressure after a chastening run of defeats, and has suffered severe and instant headloss as a result.",
      "Funny to think of a manager who’s just beaten Real Madrid in the Champions League being under threat, but defeat at the Etihad was miserable before Nottingham Forest came along and achieved the amusing feat of being the first team to shut Liverpool out in the Premier League at Anfield since Nottingham Forest.",
      "And then there was a new nadir against PSV. That really was very, very bad. West Ham were wonderfully welcoming hosts on Sunday, but to such an inexplicable extent that it’s hard to know just how much to read into Liverpool’s 2-0 win at the London Stadium against opponents who were barely there. Predictably, they were poor in a 1-1 against proper team Sunderland and showed no backbone in the collapse at Leeds United, which was then followed by a distinctly unwelcome MO SALAH BOMBSHELL that does leave things looking distinctly like either he or the manager will have to go.",
      "A run of four consecutive wins cools the immediate temperatures, but it does all feel extremely precarious. The wins over Spurs and Wolves have lacked any real authority.",
      "",
      "One of the key early-season imponderables for 25/26 was just how big and what kind of impact the Club World Cup might have on the way Chelsea and Man City start the season. Would they hit the ground running, or would they be a bit tired and out of sorts? For both, it’s been a little from column A, a little from column B.",
      "Maresca definitely still has some hearts and minds to win at Chelsea despite the fine finish to the season that saw them tick off Champions League qualification while completing their collection of UEFA pots and pans and then winning the actual Club World Cup.",
      "A home draw with Crystal Palace wasn’t ideal, but the paddling dished out to West Ham has what really should at least be some kind of halfway credible title bid up and running at least. And we strongly suspect Fulham won’t be the last team left scratching their head after losing to Maresca.",
      "There was some talk of ‘Maresca out’ after a draw with Brentford but that was surely only a minority view. After losing to Manchester United in shambolic fashion, there were more on the bandwagon.",
      "That win over Liverpool was big, though, and a particularly good one for Maresca himself. The second half thumping of Forest was handy, too, albeit inevitably saying far more of their opponents than it did of Chelsea. Home defeat to Sunderland saw awkward questions resurfacing, but three wins from three before going toe-to-toe against champions elect Arsenal despite playing most of the game down to 10 men appeared to have rubber-stamped Chelsea’s bona fides.",
      "And then they lost to Leeds United. Which was largely Maresca’s fault. And then continued their self-fulfilling 2024-redux tumble out of the title race with a draw against Bournemouth. Sigh.",
      "Then even a welcome victory has put Maresca under even more pressure after he decided to be very, very weird about everything immediately afterwards.",
      "And while Chelsea aren’t the first team to see apparent control of a game against Villa turn into a painful, perplexing defeat, they are perhaps the most profound example. And it was another that raised serious questions about the players and manager.",
      "",
      "A 4-1 thumping of Everton followed a simply huge and wildly unexpected win over Manchester City. Had Newcastle lost that, as all pre-interlull indications suggested they would, then the spotlight would have been harsh indeed on Howe and his team. They would at that point find themselves slap bang in the muck of a relegation scrap; instead they have lifted themselves back into the mid-table morass where – luckily for them – absolutely nobody is any good at all and the chance of re-establishing themselves in there and even emerging out the top was very real indeed.",
      "But instead, they haven’t kicked on at all. A home win over Burnley is their only success in five subsequent games, all of which were winnable. It’s emblematic of a season stubbornly refusing to get going and could yet prove costly for Howe.",
      "",
      "So doomed now they might as well stick with Edwards for a bit. He’s only just got here. And narrow defeats at Arsenal and Liverpool have at least showed a bit of something.",
      "",
      "The hard-nosed yet valid argument persists that Leeds could and perhaps should have taken drastic action in the summer even after their very good week. It would have made Spurs’ decision to sack Europa League-winning Ange Postecoglou look positively kind, Leeds – and Burnley for that matter – might now be better off had they thanked the managers who secured 100 Championship points and got them back into the big time and then sent them on their way.",
      "Farke had a dreadful Premier League record of only six wins and 26 points from his 49 games in charge of Norwich, a team he twice led to promotion from the Championship with 94 and 97 points.",
      "As well as fighting his own record in this competition, Farke faced the added burden of expectation levels very different to those at just about any other club that could possibly find itself promoted into the Premier League in this current era where that represents the most bittersweet of successes.",
      "Defeat at Burnley was honking, but bouncing back to win another six-pointer against West Ham eased the stress significantly before a paddling at Brighton and events elsewhere – including West Ham themselves – left Farke desperately short of immediate cover before a desperately poor show in a six-pointer at Nottingham Forest.",
      "Another painful defeat having gone in front, against Villa this time, saw Leeds drop into the bottom three ahead of a brutal run of games, but that run has gone surprisingly well. The narrow loss to Man City preceded a rare home win against Chelsea and comeback draw against Liverpool.",
      "The question now is whether Leeds and Farke have really hit on something sustainable, or this is merely delaying the inevitable. After the 4-1 win against Crystal Palace, it really does start to look like it might be the latter which has enormous repercussions for both Farke and several other names around him on this list.",
      "",
      "Seven points from three games against Newcastle, Burnley and Bournemouth left things looking far comfier than might have been expected for a manager who, when the Magpies took an early lead at the London Stadium, looked to be heading for a second sack of the season long before the Christmas decorations went up.",
      "But quite why Nuno had to be so very Nuno in the way he, on the back of 3-1 and 3-2 wins and a 2-2 draw, decided to approach a home game against a Liverpool team that had just suffered three consecutive three-goal defeats, is puzzling, irritating and, above all, a reminder that he is here as a firefighter and that the marriage to a fanbase with limited patience for drab and functional let’s-not-get-relegated football is merely one of convenience.",
      "Especially as we still await truly compelling evidence that this football won’t, in fact, get them relegated. They are still in the bottom three and the increasing signs of life at Nottingham Forest, Leeds and others have to be a concern.",
      "Are there three worse teams than West Ham in the Premier League this season? It’s an extremely fair question with an increasingly troubling conclusion for those of a Hammers persuasion.",
      "",
      "Decision time for Burnley. There are two options available, and they prompt inevitable questions.",
      "Option one: Burnley decide to really try and beat relegation, and must decide whether they think Parker is the best man for that job.",
      "Option two: Burnley accept their overwhelmingly likely fate, and must decide whether Parker the best man to get them back up again.",
      "Parker’s job prospects likely rest on the decision. Because if it is indeed option two, he has a compelling case. Option one? He’s f*cked.",
      "",
      "There have been good days and bad, and our whole pondering of Frank’s situation at Spurs has been about determining which of the two would eventually win out. The harrowing NLD-PSG-Fulham week was the first time he really did look f*cked.",
      "Spurs were timid and abysmal in the North London Derby, the second big London derby in a row which Frank had approached more in the manner of a League One manager attempting to avoid a paddling in the FA Cup third round than a legitimate rival facing a familiar foe.",
      "There was some encouragement in a 5-3 Champions League defeat at PSG, but even the very fact it’s possible to write the words ‘some encouragement in a 5-3 Champions League defeat’ is in its own way damning.",
      "But at least those two defeats came against what genuinely might be the two best teams in Europe at this time. With all due respect to Fulham and the sterling work of Marco Silva in recent years, they are not one of the two best teams in Europe at this time, and they were still much better than Spurs who torpedoed themselves inside the opening seven minutes to extend their extraordinarily – and in fairness largely pre-Frank – awful home record in the Premier League to three wins in 21 games since an increasingly odd-looking 4-1 win over Aston Villa in November last year.",
      "Frank’s response to the booing of Guglielmo Vicario after his hideous blunder was firmly in the ‘That’s true, but he shouldn’t say it’ category. And the way he went about it was all wrong.",
      "There should have been some acknowledgement that the booing of Vicario, unsavoury and unhelpful as it may have been, did not burst forth from a clear blue sky but instead a bubbling frustration from fans who pay among the highest ticket prices in the country to watch what is now among the worst and least effective football in the country.",
      "To instead label those supporters – and the boos did not come from a tiny minority inside the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium – not real Spurs fans was another gaffe that pushes the manager further towards the exit.",
      "Until that point we’d felt the obvious comparisons between Thomas Frank and Nuno Espirito Santo didn’t quite fit.",
      "But it’s certainly starting to look uncomfortably similar in familiar ways; the small-time approach to big games has not been well received and the fear grows that he just doesn’t understand what this job requires. The fact almost no manager in Premier League history has managed to understand what this job requires is cold comfort at this time.",
      "However, from there Spurs went to Newcastle and got a draw (albeit a ludicrous one) before they had a dominant 2-0 win against Frank’s old club Brentford, which everyone at Spurs sorely needed. It was easily their most convincing Premier League performance since the win at City on matchday two and a result that could have been even more compelling.",
      "They then pretty much secured a Champions League play-off round spot at the very least with a fine 3-0 win over Slavia Prague.",
      "But Spurs are Spurs, so they followed that with the worst performance yet of Frank’s reign in a truly inept and miserable 3-0 defeat at Nottingham Forest.",
      "Bringing Joao Palhinha and Ben Davies on to try and hold on to a 2-0 defeat and not even managing that feels uncomfortably like the infamous Nuno Moment against Manchester United.",
      "Have reached the kind of state where a dreadful home defeat to a very poor Liverpool is being dressed up as ‘signs of encouragement’. In reality, it might have been the worst possible result; still a defeat, yet one that risks extending the increasingly obviously doomed reign of the latest manager to be chewed up and spat out by the country’s most preposterous football club.",
      "But with Palace and then another date with his old club Brentford, it’s not hard to picture what might happen next.",
      "READ: Ten reasons why it’s going wrong for Thomas Frank’s Spurs – and it’s going to get worse",
      "",

      "Including Viktor Gyokeres, Thomas Frank, Oliver Glasner and Marc Guehi, we decide each Premier League club’s biggest mistake of 2025.",

      "Sterling is likely to leave Stamford Bridge in January as he looks to revive his career and former Liverpool striker Dean Saunders reckons he can still play for a top club.",

      "Saunders dropped in Man Utd as a possible side he could join in January, he continued: “If you’re looking to strengthen your team, I mean, he could play anywhere, couldn’t he? He could play for Man United.",
      "“When he’s at his peak, he could get in Liverpool’s team, obviously, he played for them.",

      "Perhaps their poor form offers the perfect time for the club’s hierarchy to sit down with Iraola and offer him a new deal. It could come across as a huge display of faith, and then Bournemouth will benefit financially when Manchester City or someone else pays a hefty compensation fee.",
      "Finances are obviously not the biggest positive of renewing Iraola’s contract. They should be desperate to keep the man who’s led them to 12th and 9th in the Premier League.",
      "",
      "Gambling on Keith Andrews felt like a guaranteed inclusion when he was chosen as Thomas Frank’s replacement, but Brentford’s in-house style has not come back to bite them in the backside. We all tipped them to go down, and while that’s still realistic, the Bees are doing much better than most expected following the departures of head coach Frank, star players Yoane Wissa and Bryan Mbeumo, and club captain Christian Norgaard.",
      "Brentford might’ve enjoyed even more success last season if Kayode was allowed to properly channel his inner Rory Delap, and not unleashing it sooner – or at least more often last season – is their biggest mistake of 2025. Yes, we are struggling a bit.",
      "Brentford are 10th for throw-ins taken this season with 325, but Kayode is top in the player ranking with 191 – that is 58.77% of his side’s throws and the highest in the Premier League for an individual by 33.",
      "Kayode’s long throws were in Brentford’s arsenal last season, but it’s certainly cranked up a notch this term.",

      "Brighton’s record when Hurzeler is wearing a tracksuit: six wins, four draws, two defeats, 29 goals scored, 12 conceded. Brighton’s record when Hurzeler is wearing his boohooMAN nonsense: one win, two draws, three defeats, six goals scored, ten conceded.",

      "It’s obviously not a simple task for Burnley to sign a player on the level of Granit Xhaka following promotion to the Premier League, but people would’ve said the same thing about Sunderland, who did sign Xhaka and instantly handed him the captaincy.",
      "If there is a blueprint for avoiding immediate relegation, Sunderland have found it. Clubs have spent big following promotions but nowhere near as savvily as the Black Cats. Their signing of Xhaka has been the biggest factor in their success, and Burnley’s recruitment didn’t include anyone close to Xhaka’s experience and ability. Amazingly, it could’ve made such a significant difference.",
      "",
      "We are again questioning why Chelsea still don’t have an elite striker or goalkeeper after spending so much money.",
      "Joao Pedro showed us at the Club World Cup that he is capable of being a world-class No.9, but he’s not really played there this season. Meanwhile, Robert Sanchez has never been so comfortably No.1 at Stamford Bridge. Still, it’s weird that Chelsea were properly stingy with Milan in negotiations for France goalkeeper Mike Maignan.",
      "Maignan is one of the best goalkeepers in the world and was available for around £20million, yet Chelsea didn’t want to pay over £12m. Yes, he is out of contract next summer, but we’re completely baffled that a club so scattergun and trigger-happy in the transfer market were unwilling to pay an extra ~£8m to fix a problem position with a world-class signing.",
      "",
      "Palace are going to lose Oliver Glasner. That is obvious. When? Probably at the end of 2025/26. Where will he go? That’s anyone’s guess.",
      "After guiding the Eagles to their first-ever trophy and subsequently their first-ever European campaign, Glasner wanted more backing in the summer transfer window. He felt massively let down by chairman Steve Parish and let the media know as much, while Parish couldn’t fight his corner as losing the Austrian before 2025/26 started would’ve been an absolute disaster.",
      "It’s felt inevitable that Glasner would take the step up to a bigger club, and a disappointing summer is one of the biggest reasons he won’t renew his contract and walk away in June, if not sooner.",
      "",
      "Everton have lacked a prolific goalscorer for a while. It’s something they desperately needed to address last summer, and they did so by signing a top, young player with bags of potential in Thierno Barry. It’s safe to say it hasn’t worked out for him so far.",
      "Dominic Calvert-Lewin, at his absolute best, scored 16 Premier League goals in 2020/21, the most for the Toffees since Romelu Lukaku backed up an 18-goal campaign with a 25-goal 2016/17.",
      "Everton should probably stick to recruiting strikers from English clubs. Their list of top scorers in each Premier League season goes as follows (centre-forwards only): Calvert-Lewin, Richarlison, Calvert-Lewin, Richarlison, Calvert-Lewin, Richarlison, Wayne Rooney, Lukaku x4, Nikica Jelavic, Tim Cahill, Louis Saha, Cahill, Yakubu, Andy Johnson, James Beattie, Cahill, Rooney, Tomasz Radzinski, Radzinski and Duncan Ferguson, Kevin Campbell x3, Ferguson x2, Paul Rideout, Tony Cottee x2.",
      "Jelavic and Ferguson hadn’t played in England before joining but were signed straight from Scotland. Radzinski is the only non-Brit there playing for his first English club.",
      "The moral of the story is: keep your striker recruitment a little more local, Everton.",
      "",
      "After watching Crystal Palace win their first major trophy, Fulham must’ve felt desperate to experience the same. Their summer transfer business suggests they’re happy where they are – winning sod all but comfortably avoiding relegation every season.",
      "Kevin was an exciting signing, and Samuel Chukwueze has shown promise, but it was a very underwhelming summer window for the Cottagers.",
      "",
      "As the alphabet would have it, Leeds follow Fulham, and the latter’s best decision of 2025 has created the former’s worst.",
      "Leeds were reportedly interested in signing Wilson in the summer transfer window but couldn’t get a deal over the line. Who knew that he would become a bloody revelation at Craven Cottage a couple of months later? We certainly didn’t.",
      "Daniel Farke was actually let down badly in the end after a strong start to the club’s summer business. He needed more in attack. At least Calvert-Lewin is doing well now.",
      "",
      "Choosing Jeremie Frimpong as Trent Alexander-Arnold’s replacement, picking Florian Wirtz over Rayan Cherki, and signing a player who might be the biggest flop of all flops in Premier League floppyville were big gaffes, but it’s hard to argue that they were worse decisions than waiting until deadline day to have a bid accepted for Marc Guehi.",
      "Guehi leaving could have been the straw that broke the camel’s back for Glasner at Palace, and it could have made a huge difference in an awful first half to the season for the Reds.",
      "He would’ve been able to take a struggling Ibrahima Konate out of the firing line and surely played well enough to stay in the team. Had Guehi been playing well next to Virgil van Dijk, the Liverpool captain and the two full-backs would also look a lot more comfortable.",
      "Yes, Liverpool can get Guehi for nothing next summer, but they have desperately needed him this term.",
      "",
      "This isn’t a huge error on City’s side, but a case of hindsight being a wonderful (or gut-wrenchingly frustrating) thing for young Trafford.",
      "An honourable mention is rejecting big money from Tottenham for Savinho. We’re really not sure what either side was thinking there.",
      "",
      "How long have you got with this lot? It’s pretty difficult to pinpoint the worst decision United made in 2025. Sir Jim Ratcliffe has done and said some very odd things. Ruben Amorim might’ve been sacked four or five times. Spending all of their summer budget on attackers might not have been the best move. Not signing a goalkeeper in January was also a bit silly, if not completely forced by a shoestring budget.",
      "We have landed on a specific part of their Europa League final preparation.",
      "Basically, Amorim opted for continuity and confidence by playing his strongest team in the weeks building up to the final. Spurs boss Ange Postecoglou, meanwhile, rested everyone to ensure his players were fit and well-rested for an absolutely monumental game of football.",
      "Ultimately, one decision aged well, earned the club £100m, and qualified them for the Champions League. And the other decision might’ve cost United the £100m windfall and Champions League football, which Amorim swears he didn’t really want anyway.",
      "",
      "In terms of 2025 transfers, the richest club in the Premier League have had a torrid time. The £55m they spent on Elanga surely goes down as their biggest gaffe, though.",
      "He has really struggled. Like really, really struggled. We don’t want to absolutely hammer the poor lad, so we’ll leave it at that.",
      "",
      "Eight games, zero wins, two draws, six defeats, zero clean sheets, seven goals scored, 17 goals conceded, 39 days in charge, sacked 18 minutes after losing his final match.",
      "Need we say any more?",
      "",
      "If we’re poking holes in their summer recruitment, it would be that they signed quite a few African players in an Africa Cup of Nations season.",
      "AFCON will affect the Black Cats more than any other Premier League club with regular starters Bertrand Traore, Noah Sadiki, and Reinildo all representing their countries, while another important player, Habib Diarra, has returned from injury just in time to link up with his Senegal teammates. Morocco’s Chemsdine Talbi and DR Congo’s Arthur Masuaku are also away and have featured plenty this term.",
      "",
      "On paper, Spurs have a pretty good squad. But football isn’t played on paper, and clearly something is missing. Xavi Simons and Mohammed Kudus should’ve brought an X-factor to Thomas Frank’s squad, but they’ve blown very hot and cold in their early months at the club.",
      "‘Hiring Thomas Frank’ is just the tip of the iceberg. It’s maybe harsh on him because he is a good manager who is willing to adapt, but it’s more that he isn’t the right profile for Spurs.",
      "They needed someone with a proper coaching identity, which Frank unfortunately lacks. He is chopping and changing his tactics too often. We honestly don’t know if he’s an attack-minded coach or a defense-minded coach. He does lean more towards the latter, which is fine for Brentford, but not for a ball-dominant team.",
      "Hopefully Frank is given enough time to prove us wrong and does exactly that, but his first six months at Spurs have been concerning.",
      "",
      "Feels like a lifetime ago, doesn’t it? Well, it happened in January 2025. Potter replaced Julen Lopetegui, and despite defeat in his first game, we thought there was already marked improvement and that the Englishman’s long-awaited return to the dugout was going to go just fine.",
      "Alas, he was sacked in September with West Ham 19th in the Premier League. His win rate was an abysmal 24% during his time at the club. West Ham were the worst ever-present Premier League club during his tenure, accumulating 23 points, four fewer than Wolves, who were above Spurs and Man United by two points and one respectively.",
      "Nuno Espirito Santo has slightly steadied the ship, but we’re not fully convinced West Ham won’t sink into the Championship for the first time since 2011/12.",
      "",
      "Replacing star players like Matheus Cunha and Rayan Ait-Nouri were the trickiest of tasks for any Premier League club last summer, and Wolves did so…very poorly.",
      "Ait-Nouri’s replacement, David Moller Wolfe, cost £10m but didn’t really come into the team until Rob Edwards joined. Less can be said about that because Ait-Nouri was important to Wolves, but his importance didn’t come close to Cunha’s.",
      "He basically was Vitor Pereira’s system. That does make replacing him almost impossible, but his importance underlined how vital it is for a relegation candidate to have a proper game-changer in attack. Leeds survived because they had Raphinha. Wolves survived because they had Cunha…and Ipswich, Southampton, and Leicester were atrocious.",
      "Tasked with filling the Cunha void were Jhon Arias and Fer Lopez, who joined for a combined £34m. Neither has impressed, and Wolves only have two points this season, which hints at more complex problems than ‘they couldn’t replace their best players very well’.",

      "In a way it is difficult not to admire Ruben Amorim, the dogmatic Manchester United manager appointed specifically for his unwavering faith in principles which have broken myriad negative records, delivered a 15th-placed Premier League finish and produced one of the most miserable major tournament final surrenders in modern history.",
      "The Portuguese, having realised that Sir Jim Ratcliffe and INEOS have taken a Ludovico Technique-style approach to this infernal staring contest with a manager they have wedded themselves to for better or considerably worse, finally admitted he “would do 75% of things different” if offered the opportunity again.",
      "While that does beg the question of precisely how much of this year-long agony was entirely necessary, it also suggests a level of hitherto denied malleability, the sort required for any coach to succeed.",
      "But it leaves two intriguing points: what things would Amorim change? And far more fascinating: what would he not?",
      "It might ordinarily be assumed that giving Newcastle 66% of the ball at Old Trafford would fall under the 75% of things Amorim would alter but when such a sacrifice of possession is made at the altar of victory, perhaps not.",
      "And the first half especially was generally positive. Patrick Dorgu marked a fine performance on the right wing with a spectacular first goal for the club, Benjamin Sesko led the line admirably, Matheus Cunha sparkled and Lisandro Martinez helped pull it all together at the back as captain.",
      "Yet as with the other wins Amorim has overseen at Manchester United, his 25th was underpinned by questionable calls and a sense of general chaos.",
      "On the face of it, this was a Premier League win, lifting them to fifth in the table, with: a 19-year-old at centre-half partnering a player making his first start in almost a year; their three best forwards of the season either at AFCON or watching from the stands with a dodgy hamstring; a player making the second and longest appearance of his Premier League career at 45 minutes; another making his third Premier League career appearance, and first in a win; and someone playing his first game of professional football in more than seven months.",
      "Ayden Heaven, Lisandro Martinez, Jack Fletcher, Tyler Fredricson and Tyrell Malacia is pure, unadulterated, found-down-the-back-of-the-sofa-in-time-for-Boxing-Day nonsense.",
      "And it just about worked. Only by technicality of the scoreline, the most important technicality of all. But those are three crucial points all the same, the sort which these players and this manager would rarely have held out for in the past.",
      "The awfulness of Newcastle helped. They had four times as many shots as their hosts in the second half and three-quarters of the ball but at no stage did they look particularly likely to decimate the deficit. Beyond the excellent Lewis Hall striking the bar it was an absurdly tiresome slog and a continuation of their away angst.",
      "Those travel travails were summed up neatly by the moment in the second half when Nick Woltemade’s clever flick allowed Jacob Ramsey time and space to move into the area, at which point he stumbled over his own feet and collapsed to the floor.",
      "Both were removed in a triple substitution around the hour mark which Eddie Howe designed to capitalise on the momentum that had long since settled in Newcastle’s favour. Yoane Wissa, Joelinton and Harvey Barnes entered as Manchester United were starting to sink deeper into their own half.",
      "Yet at no real point did Amorim’s side look like caving in. Not when Sesko – and Manchester United’s pressure-relieving forward pivot – was taken off, nor when a bemused Casemiro followed. Not when the manager substituted his two most senior defenders with backs against the wall in the 88th minute.",
      "Some of that is on Newcastle’s inability to create much of note. But it is also credit to Manchester United for digging in.",
      "And it gave Amorim an opportunity to showcase a side of himself which has been lost in the mess of the last year: his charisma.",
      "“Back four, clean sheet, Kobbie Mainoo is injured. I don’t need a press conference, we covered all the subjects, so can all go away and enjoy Boxing Day,” were his CliffsNotes from an evening in which Manchester United made hard work of putting in the hard work, only for it to actually pay off for once.",

      "It’s a huge blow for United, who only know life with their captain in the starting XI. It will be interesting to see how they cope without him. They will either crumble, or, for no reason other than football being very weird at times, look significantly better.",
      "Kobbie Mainoo is the natural choice to replace Fernandes, but he is also injured.",
      "It’s typical of the young midfielder’s season, which has been stop-start and frustrating. Mainoo knows he is competing against Fernandes for a starting spot rather than alongside him.",

      "He started against Villa last weekend and could start again if Amorim believes continuity is required to restore his form.",
      "But with Newcastle looking far less combative and physical in midfield, there is little need to pair the two South Americans.",
      "Fletcher is an option, but it will likely be Mount who starts alongside Casemiro, who returns from suspension to face the Magpies.",

They’re certainly playing more convincing football than Arsenal right now, and have another chance to briefly leapfrog their main title rivals and put pressure on a potentially ticklish home game for Arsenal against a Brighton side who so often relish the chance to mess with the bigger boys.",
      "But in order to apply that pressure City must take care of their own business against Sean Dyche’s Nottingham Forest, a team that can’t quite be described as resurgent but is definitely no longer the pushover of the brief but hilarious Angeball days.",
      "They’ve been alternating between victory and defeat for the last six Premier League games, and the bad news for City is that they’ll arrive at the City Ground at the wrong point in that particular pattern.",
      "The good news for City is that they aren’t currently alternating anything having won each of their last five Premier League games, the last three of them by 3-0 margins and with 17 goals in total across those five games. Which, even after the 3-0 paddling of Tottenham the other week, is still the total number of Premier League goals Forest have managed all season.",
      "",
      "We may only have one Premier League game on Boxing Day, because of woke, but it is at least a good one as the tentatively improving Man United take on a frustrating Newcastle side whose season still awaits any kind of real lift-off.",
      "The big news for the home side, of course, is how they fare without Bruno Fernandes. He isn’t the actual most irreplaceable player in the league, because that probably is still just Erling Haaland because of sheer weight of numbers, but his combination of vital importance and until now impeccable reliability does give this some real heft.",
      "This is a player who basically plays all of the football for Man United, and there’s a certain irony that his first vaguely serious injury in five years has come right at the start of the busiest time of the quietest season.",
      "But every crisis is an opportunity, and now for the first time in his United career we get the chance to see Mason Mount cast in a starring rather than supporting role.",
      "For him, the timing does seem rather good. He has in recent weeks been playing the best football he’s produced since leaving Chelsea and has already proved he can do a job playing alongside United’s undisputed star man.",
      "Now he must show he can pull the strings in Bruno’s absence, or all the hints of recovery for both United and Mount himself over the last couple of months could be washed away before January is through.",
      "",
      "The current favourite in the Sack Race takes on the current favourite to replace him as Thomas Frank’s Tottenham travel to Crystal Palace for a real melon-twister of a game.",
      "Oliver Glasner’s departure for somewhere shinier than Palace has long felt inevitable, but it wouldn’t do at all for them to lose him to somewhere as ropey as Spurs. So Palace need to tread carefully here, making sure to win, obviously, but not in such a way as to hasten Frank’s demise.",
      "Luckily, Liverpool have given them the perfect blueprint for how to be alarmingly bad but still beat Spurs.",
      "Frank is, clearly, in very deep trouble. The fallout from that vaguely absurd game against Liverpool in which Spurs played better with 10 men and then better still with nine means he has to try and engineer a result at Selhurst Park without both Xavi Simons and Cristian Romero. Both let him down badly on Saturday in inconsistent seasons, and this doesn’t look like a moment in which Spurs or Frank can afford to have both their attack and defence weakened in this manner.",
      "Frank has already survived one encounter with his former club Brentford that had the possibility to end his Tottenham reign. But if he leaves Selhurst Park with the result we suspect, then the New Year trip to his old patch will carry old problems.",
      "There was mitigation and even encouragement from the performance even in defeat against Liverpool, but that won’t fly in the next couple of games. He’s got to find a result in one of these two games surely. And even that may be no more than delaying the now inevitable.",
      "",
      "Unlike the ultra-woke, Christmas-cancelling Premier League, the Football League is delivering a full sack of Boxing Day fixtures to enjoy with your turkey sandwiches, Rennies and hangover.",
      "Couple of tasty ones from the Championship promotion picture, too, with a couple of six-pointers among pairs of teams with their eyes on a play-off finish at worst.",
      "Stoke v Preston is one, with the Potters looking to arrest their recent slide while for Preston the recent issue has been too many draws in a six-match unbeaten run.",
      "The pick, though, looks to be Millwall v Ipswich, because third v sixth with third place up for grabs is always a particularly delicious dynamic for a Championship fixture at any time of the season.",
      "",
      "God bless Serie A for carrying on even though it’s Christmas, and also this season for delivering what looks certain to be the best title race across Europe’s big leagues. We still here have a top five separated by just four points and after a bad couple of weeks for Bologna and Como it does seem now to have crystallised into a scrap between five big guns.",
      "It’s currently all rather neat, with Inter top on 33 points and stacked up at one-point increments behind them come Milan, Napoli, Roma and Juventus.",
      "The Christmas weekend doesn’t pit any of the contenders in direct conflict, but Inter’s trip to Atalanta does look as good a choice as any.",
      "Essentially, absent a clear standout fixture for any of those title contenders, if you’re picking one game Inter are generally the safest bet on the entertainment front. They’ve conceded more goals than anyone else in the top eight bar Juventus (by a single goal) but with 34 goals in their 15 games thus far are 10 goals clear of anyone else."

      "Ruben Amorim’s side were perhaps the better team against Aston Villa on Sunday in their 2-1 defeat with the Red Devils missing Bryan Mbeumo, Amad Diallo and Noussair Mazraoui to Africa Cup of Nations duty.",
      "There were a number of youngsters on the Man Utd bench on Sunday and it now seems the Red Devils are likely to enter the January transfer market for new players.",
      "Man Utd had strong interest in signing Antoine Semenyo from Bournemouth until widespread reports claimed that Man City is the Ghana international’s ‘preference’.",
      "With Amorim’s insistence that Man Utd don’t want to rely on short-term fixes, any deal for an attacker could have to wait until the summer, unless another good opportunity arises.",
      "READ: Top 10 post-Christmas title capitulations to frighten Arsenal (who have previous)",
      "And reports in Spain claim that Real Madrid have ‘received two offers of more than €100m’ for Vinicius Junior, one of which has come from the Red Devils.",
      "Real Madrid are struggling to get Vinicius Junior to sign a new deal as the Brazil international wants parity with top earner Kylian Mbappe.",
      "The report adds: ‘Faced with this situation, those at the Bernabeu have decided not to remain idle. Real Madrid are already listening to offers and, according to sources close to the club, two very serious proposals have arrived from the Premier League. Chelsea and Manchester United have put more than €100 million on the table to acquire Vinicius this summer, a figure that, at the very least, compels them to sit down and talk.",
      "‘At Real Madrid, there’s no urgency to sell, but there is concern about losing control of the narrative. Letting time pass without renewing Vinicius ‘ contract could become a strategic problem, especially if the player enters the final stretch of his contract without an agreement. Selling now, with strong offers and room to manoeuvre, is starting to look like a logical option.’",
      "There could be conversations about Man Utd captain Bruno Fernandes being involved in the deal for Vinicius Junior in the summer with Spanish website Fichajes claiming Real Madrid see the Portugal international as a ‘realistic option’.",
      "It has been revealed that clubs from outside the Premier League can buy Fernandes for €60m as he has a release clause in his contract and ‘that amount fits within Real Madrid’s parameters for a strategic signing’.",
      "Fichajes adds: ‘Herein lies the main doubt. Bruno Fernandes is 31 years old, a factor that doesn’t quite convince Florentino Pérez. In recent years, the president has opted for young signings with potential and resale value.",
      "‘However, the club also recognizes the need for balance. Incorporating proven experience can be key to supporting an increasingly young squad in crucial moments.’",
      "Fabrizio Romano clarified Fernandes’ release clause earlier this week, he said: “In January, I don’t expect any movement despite all the interviews, all the quotes from Bruno. My expectation is not for Bruno to move in January. Bruno is expected to stay at Man Utd. We will see in summer 2026 what happens. From Saudi they are still interested.",
      "“There is a release clause in the contract of Fernandes. And the clause is not valid for Premier League clubs. It’s only valid for clubs from abroad.",
      "“It’s slightly over €60m, so there would be the possibility for several clubs to attack. But in that case, it depends on what Bruno wants to do.",
      "“Bruno said already in an interview a few days ago that he said no to Saudi, it was Al-Hilal in the summer transfer window. Bruno wanted to stay at Man Utd, but the clause is going to be still there in summer 2026.",
      "“It’s going to be up to Bruno to decide what he wants to do next and what’s going to be the mission for him on the transfer market for summer 2026. As of now, I can guarantee that the focus of Bruno is completely on Man Utd. Bruno wants to do his best for Man Utd.",
      "“Then there is the World Cup with Portugal as well. But in terms of club football, Bruno only wants to focus on United. He is not planning any transfer. It’s from Saudi that they are still very interested in Bruno, but it’s not Bruno entertaining talks or opening discussions already for 2026.”",

      "The Red Devils have been through many poor signings just in the past decade with Antony, Jadon Sancho and Casemiro among the names to arrive for big money and contribute less than their price tag would promise.",
      "Former Man Utd flops Juan Sebastian Veron, Eric Djemba-Djemba, Angel di Maria, Diego Forlan and others will go down as some of the worst deals in the clubs history – but Scholes reckons Bosnich is up there due to his “unprofessional” nature.",
      "When suggested that Veron was the Red Devils’ worst-ever signing, Scholes replied on The Overlap: “Veron was a great player, a talented player. Don’t really know why it didn’t work for him but what a footballer.",
      "“I go back to the goalkeepers, when you had to try and replace Peter Schmeichel, which is always going to be difficult.",

      "“In shooting practice, you normally have like 15, 20 shots. After three shots, he’s knackered, ‘oh no, get someone else in’.",
      "“I never realised, he couldn’t kick a football. I’ve never seen anything like it. We played Everton away in first game of the season, and none of us picked up on it, he couldn’t reach the halfway line.",
      "“There was no wind, it was a perfect day. But when you look at his feet, size 14s, honestly he was just kicking the floor all the time, big flippers. Honestly, it was disappointing.”",
      "In Alex Ferguson: My Autobiography in 2013, Sir Alex Ferguson also branded Bosnich – who came through the youth ranks at Man Utd – “a terrible professional”.",
      "On Bosnich, who played 38 times in two spells for Man Utd, Ferguson said: “Mark Bosnich was, in my opinion, a terrible professional, which we should have known.",
      "“The Bosnich buy stemmed from Peter Schmeichel announcing in the autumn of his final season that he would be retiring, which caught us on the hop. We jumped into decisions.",
      "“We met Bosnich in January, despite reports filtering through to us about his conduct off the pitch. I sent someone down to watch him in training. He was doing nothing in the sessions that convinced me he was the right man for Manchester United.",
      "“I changed tack and went for Edwin van der Sar instead, spoke to his agent and then to Martin Edwards, who told me, ‘Alex, I’m sorry, I’ve shaken hands with Bosnich.’ That was a blow. Martin had shaken Mark’s hand and would not go back on his word, which I respect. But it was a bad piece of business.”",
      "When asked about Ferguson’s comments about him, the former Man Utd goalkeeper told FourFourTwo: “It wasn’t unfair – it was just a lie.",
      "“He’s always said that he doesn’t bear any grudges, but obviously he does. But he can say that because he knows what happened afterwards, with the drugs and so on – he’s got good evidence to back himself up. At that time, though, it was a lie.",
      "“Alex Ferguson signed me twice. I wouldn’t be talking to you now about my career unless he had taken a chance on me originally. Yes, we had a falling out, but these things happen. He was a great manager to play under.”",

      "As a Christmas treat we always like to revisit our pre-season predictions to get a sneak peek at who is on the way to looking utterly clueless.",
      "The full pre-season predictions are here if you want to have a proper laugh, or we will pick out the highlights…",
      "Starting – as is traditional – with the Premier League champions, this was bold from the boss (me): ‘Not Arsenal. Not having that.’ So guess who is very, very invested in the Gunners f***ing this up as they traditionally do from being top at Christmas.",
      "Dave Tickner was the only F365-er who actually tipped Arsenal, while Matt Stead and Ian Watson also plumped for Manchester City. The rest are already out of the race by tipping Liverpool and Chelsea; this was back in the days when we were dreaming of a four-horse title race.",
      "The top four, which nobody ever gets right? Every single one of us went for a combination of last season’s top four, with Lewis Oldham adding to his Liverpool title prediction with this beauty: ‘Chelsea. Arsenal. Manchester City. Not sold on City as title challengers yet. Arsenal third in the battle for first as real deal Chelsea (26/27 will be their year) to edge out their rivals to second and potentially seal Arteta sack.’",
      "Nobody saw Aston Villa coming.",
      "Let’s get relegation out of the way. Some of us absolutely f***ed it on Sunderland but Joe Williams, Jason Soutar and Lewis Oldham saw the Black Cats surprise coming. There were far too many Brentford shouts, but John Nicholson, Williams and Soutar nailed it on Wolves. Williams may yet still entirely nail it with Wolves, Burnley and Leeds, but that’s expecting a lot of West Ham.",
      "The pleasant surprise of the season? There was a weird volume of excitement about Everton, but points go again to Williams for his Sunderland shout. It looked ridiculous at the time. What looks ridiculous now is Stead: ‘It has been an absolute delight to laugh at them all summer but Newcastle will rise from the cuck chair and excel on the pitch, if not the boardroom, with another top-five finish.’",
      "Also ridiculous was Watson dreaming that Manchester United would sign a ‘midfielder with legs’. He is still waiting.",
      "Who will win the Golden Boot? ‘This is dull but Erling Haaland. I can’t see Mo Salah coming even vaguely close,’ said Winterburn (me, this is weird). Taking that all day.",
      "We’re still not sure if Johnny was being serious with his Liam Delap call, while Watson bought into the Viktor Gyokeres hype. But once again, we return to Stead: ‘Alexander Isak stays, quickly realises it might not be the best idea to entirely starve oneself of competitive football in a World Cup year and has his Luis Suarez season before getting that move.’",
      "Which new signing will have the greatest positive impact? There were big shouts for Gyokeres and Joao Pedro, while Will Ford had an inkling for Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall at Everton. I did say we were oddly excited about Everton. What’s the actual answer so far? Probably Granit Xhaka or Robin Roefs.",
      "As for the massive flop…I was likely wrong on Hugo Ekitike, but Stead was right on the assorted Chelsea rejects. Williams might have nailed it again as he described Benjamin Sesko as ‘wildly overpriced’ while Tickner might be oddly prescient in suggesting that Gyokeres, Sesko and Ekitike would all struggle to reach double figures.",
      "There were calls for Bryan Mbeumo, Rayan Cherki and Noni Madueke that could be a little wide of the mark, but Ford might have smashed it with Gyokeres. The predictions were written before the Alexander Isak signing so Floppy McFlopface did not get a mention.",
      "Who will be the biggest bloody bargain? ‘Rayan Cherki feels like a steal at £34m…or a third of a Grealish,’ might be my finest hour. Stead’s Jhon Arias call might not be his, while the least said the better about mentions of Angus Gunn and Kyle Walker-Peters.",
      "PFA Player of the Year will not be Rodri, Cole Palmer or Florian Wirtz. It might be Declan Rice, though. The Spurs fan among us what the only true believer in Arsenal.",
      "The first Premier League manager to be sacked was Nuno Espirito Santo. Once again, we give you Tickner. He confidently wrote: ‘Mr Marinakis is on one right now, positively aglow with main character energy, and the off-field shenanigans cannot mask that Forest ended last season in pretty ropey fashion. And have been honking in pre-season. They only managed eight points from their final nine Premier League games last season – and it wasn’t that tough a run-in either. Start this season anything like the way they ended the last with Marinakis in his current mood to move fast and break things, and Nuno is very quickly in very big trouble.’ No notes.",
      "We always end with ‘in five words, tell us what you are most excited about this season’.",
      "I stand by mine: ‘A proper f***ing title race.’"

      "However, their 2-1 defeat to Aston Villa on Sunday means Man Utd have won just two of their last eight matches in the Premier League.",

      "READ: Top 10 post-Christmas title capitulations to frighten Arsenal (who have previous)",
      "The report adds: ‘Man United’s approach is pivotal. Rather than automatically triggering the option year, the club is pursuing a lower-wage renewal as they look to reshape their wage structure.",
      "‘That decision keeps options open for Casemiro. With the contract winding down, the wage package matters far more than a transfer fee.’",

      "“If you think about Casemiro one year ago or a bit more, there was a feeling like, okay, we have to find a solution. We have to part ways. The salary is too high. The player is not performing. He was not an important or crucial player for United.",
      "“But Casemiro has always been a legend of the game. He is the man who made the history of Real Madrid, who made history with the Brazilian national team. So a fantastic midfielder.",
      "“He’s been able to change the situation, to become a starter for Ruben Amorim, a crucial player on and off the pitch, an absolute leader, a wonderful version of Casemiro, this final one he is showing with Manchester United.",
      "“So now the desire is from Man United, obviously, to continue with Casemiro, but in different conditions.",
      "“So the salary he has right now is a salary that Manchester United don’t want to pay in the future, not because of Casemiro or Maguire, but because they want to change the salary structure.”",

      "Manchester United held on to beat Newcastle 1-0 at Old Trafford to move fifth in the Premier League after claiming their first clean sheet since early October; Ruben Amorim started a Premier League game with a back four for the first time since taking charge",
      "Saturday 27 December 2025 10:17, UK",
      "\"Sometimes you need to adapt and there is no tactic in that moment,\" said Ruben Amorim after Manchester United's 1-0 win over Newcastle. He was responding after acknowledging that he had gone with a back six late in the game.",
      "His patched-up side were holding on with Patrick Dorgu and Diogo Dalot playing ahead of the full-backs in a six-man defence. Of course, the fact that Amorim had been playing a back four at all was a fascination and an indication that his team is evolving tactically.",
      "There was a time when he would not have countenanced such a thing but he feels a little more emboldened now, able to adjust from a position of relative strength having got United up to fifth - and potentially even higher before a difficult 2025 is through.",
      "The reason for that growing confidence owes as much to the togetherness as the results, however, and that is the takeaway from this win as much as the formation. Amorim agreed that, in its own way, it was one of the most satisfying wins in that sense.",
      "\"I think it's something that we need to feel that, that we can win sometimes without playing so well, that we can win games with the spirit and with the togetherness in the team.\" He talked of his young team defending every cross and putting bodies on the line.",
      "\"We were suffering a lot,\" he explained. \"We were just trying to survive.\" He was talking about those final moments against Newcastle but it might just sum up his time at the club so far. They came through it, though. Perhaps Amorim will come through it all too.",
      "Amorim finally changed formation and his back four delivered a first clean sheet in nearly three months. Many will be wondering what took him so long - and rightly so - after more than a year of stubbornly sticking to one shape.",
      "He delivered the surprise with maximum impact by having his players warm up in a back three. It was quite the shock when United lined up at kick-off. This was the first time Amorim had started with a back four.",
      "But it begs the question of why now? This can't have been the first such game.",
      "The change becomes even more curious when you hear Amorim's comments about Dorgu, the goalscorer against Newcastle, and how he benefitted from playing as winger rather than a wing-back.",
      "\"You put him in one position that is more in front, the responsibilities are not the same, and he has more freedom to lose the ball. I think it helped Patrick to play better.\"",
      "Amorim's analysis is inarguable. This was probably Dorgu's best performance in a United shirt. But that in itself and the head coach's acknowledgement of it bring us back to that earlier question.",
      "These are points that onlookers have been making ever since Amorim took the job over a year ago. What might have happened had he listened earlier? It makes you think.",
      "Dorgu's improvement will raise questions about how other, better players might have flourished in a different shape. Bryan Mbeumo and Amad Diallo spring to mind for that position on the right wing. It certainly seems a more natural fit for Amad than wing-back.",
      "But perhaps their return from AFCON will signal an end to the experiment. There has been no clear communication about how long this will last.",
      "After spending so long defending his way there is no telling what Amorim is planning long-term. It would seem almost silly in a way, albeit totally necessary, if he were to go back on his word now and move on from solely playing three at the back.",
      "Ruben Amorim's side finished their 1-0 win over Newcastle with a back four of Lenny Yoro, Ayden Heaven, Tyler Fredricson and Tyrell Malacia.",
      "Surely, however, the conclusion for Amorim must be that his previous position of having one shape and sticking to it, regardless of personnel or game state, is a mistake not to be repeated.",
      "There are signs of genuine improvement thanks to Amorim's flexibility. That's what he should stick to.",
      "\"We have seen a big win for Man Utd. To come out and win an ugly game, specifically from a defensive point of view, keeping that clean sheet,\" the former Man Utd captain said.",
      "\"There has to be pride in your defending. An ugly win but a big win.",
      "\"The goal was fantastic, a special goal. But if you want to make progress, it has got to be about being defensively solid. It is a start in terms of momentum for the younger players but you have to find something.",
      "\"Digging out results. The teams I played in, we didn't play well every week but we dug in. They have to kick on now.\"",
      "\"It feels right for Man Utd [the change in shape]. In the last few weeks, we have seen something different.",
      "\"Tonight, with and without the ball, it's a back and midfield four. The strange thing about it, it's forced Newcastle into a back five! They've been really good.\"",

      "Amorim's tactical change to a 4-2-3-1 formation with Dorgu playing on the right wing appeared to confuse Newcastle early on, with Casemiro and Benjamin Sesko going close. And though Eddie Howe did adjust, Dorgu's wonderful volley beat Aaron Ramsdale.",
      "The 21-year-old Denmark international has had his struggles since arriving from Lecce last winter but he impressed here even beyond his spectacular goal, although it was Matheus Cunha with his driving runs from deep who lit up the first half at Old Trafford.",
      "Man Utd: Lammens (7), Heaven (8), Martinez (8), Shaw (7), Dalot (7), Ugarte (7), Casemiro (7), Dorgu (8), Mount (6), Cunha (8), Sesko (6).\n\n\nSubs: Fletcher (6), Yoro (6), Zirkzee (5), Fredricson (n/a), Malacia (n/a).\n\n\nNewcastle: Ramsdale (5), Miley (6), Schar (6), Thiaw (6), Hall (7), Guimaraes (7), Tonali (6), Ramsey (5), Murphy (6), Gordon (6), Woltemade (6). \n\n\nSubs: Joelinton (6), Wissa (6), Barnes (6), Willock (6).\n\n\nPlayer of the Match: Ayden Heaven.",
      "Although Sesko did hit the crossbar on the counter-attack, Howe's side certainly stepped up the pressure in the second half with Lewis Hall striking the underside of the bar himself. Amorim had Dorgu and Diogo Dalot as his wingers in a 4-4-2 formation.",
      "Dalot even came close to doubling the lead but it was Newcastle pushing - Lisandro Martinez, on his return to the starting line-up, surviving a VAR call for a penalty against him. They lacked the cutting edge to break down a resolute defensive effort.",
      "Manchester United finished this game with a back four of Leny Yoro, Tyler Fredricson, Ayden Heaven and Tyrell Malacia - a trio of youngsters and a left-back making his first appearance of the season. Martinez had earlier shone on his first start.",
      "The midfield two were Jack Fletcher and Manuel Ugarte, the former having come on for the injured Mason Mount at half-time. On the wings were Dalot and Dorgu. Joshua Zirkzee was up front. That Amorim was able to fashion this into a rearguard action that kept out Newcastle was a minor Christmas miracle.",
      "Manchester United won a Premier League game without Bruno Fernandes for the first time since Ralf Rangnick was in charge.",
      "On the night that Amorim changed his formation, something he had once said he could never do, he comes out of it strengthened. By the victory, of course. But, in a curious way, the manner of it too. It was not fluent but resolute. They are battling to improve.",
      "\"We had to suffer altogether in the stadium. It was really difficult for us. We had a good first half and then the second half we just defend and tried to do something with Cunha. We had our opportunities in transitions.",
      "\"It was a good win, but I had so many games here when we played well and didn't get the three points. Today it was the opposite.\"",
      "\"We have seen a big win for Man Utd. To come out and win an ugly game, specifically from a defensive point of view, keeping that clean sheet. There has to be pride in your defending.",
      "\"The goal was fantastic, a special goal. But if you want to make progress, it has got to be about being defensively solid. It is a start in terms of momentum for the younger players but you have to find something.",

      "\"Second half a lot better than the first but we didn't do enough. It was not for a lack of effort. Felt if we scored we could have gone on to win the game.\"",
      "Asked if he had been caught out by the change of formation by Amorim, Howe replied: \"Caught out? I actually thought we started the game really well for 15 to 20 minutes.",
      "\"But we didn't respond well to the goal. I was disappointed at half time with our inability to grab control of the game because I thought it was there for us to take.",
      "\"I don't think it was a tactical issue for us. I don't think we looked as physically good as we did against Chelsea when we were physically outstanding.",
      "\"I don't think there was a tactical problem for us at any stage of the game. We are disappointed with the way we defended the goal. Long throws were something we prepared for.",
      "\"We are disappointed with our actions in terms of trying to score because we created the chances, put a lot of crosses in their box. The chances were there.",

      "By Callum Bishop, Adam Bate, Noah Langford, Sam Cohen",
      "Friday 26 December 2025 19:47, UK",
      "For the first time since he joined in 2020, Manchester United face the prospect of losing the talismanic Bruno Fernandes through injury for a sustained period of time.",
      "Fernandes was replaced at half-time during the 2-1 defeat to Aston Villa after suddenly pulling up late in the first-half. United boss Ruben Amorim clarified after the game that his captain had suffered soft tissue damage and that he would miss 'some games.'",
      "It's a bitter blow for the Red Devils ahead of a busy period that could define their season. Every statistic under the sun shows just how valuable the 31-year-old is at Old Trafford.",
      "Most, if not all Manchester United fans will be thinking that this is the opportunity for Kobbie Mainoo to prove his worth to Ruben Amorim.",
      "From scoring the winning goal in the 2024 FA Cup final and representing England at that year's European Championships, the midfielder finds himself without a Premier League start this season.",
      "It has led to speculation that he could depart the Theatre of Dreams, on loan or permanently, as frustration over game time grows.",
      "Unexpectedly, the door has now opened. With Fernandes out, there is no chance Amorim lets Mainoo go in January. And having insisted that the club captain is who the academy graduate is competing with for a place in the team, it seems only logical that he will finally be handed his opportunity.",
      "That won't be against Newcastle though, as Amorim confirmed he will likely miss out with a calf injury that also saw him left out of the squad against Villa. He'll be hoping one of the other alternative options doesn't lay claim to the spot before he even has a chance to.Callum Bishop",
      "Mason Mount has started Manchester United's last three Premier League games. Into his third season as a United player, this is only the second time that he has been on such a run, previously starting four in a row at the back end of last season.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo's absence has opened up a slot for him tucked in off the right but Mount has had plenty of Premier League minutes in a deeper role and could prove a good foil alongside the far less mobile Casemiro. He would appear an able deputy for Fernandes.",
      "Of course, shifting him from the forward line, particularly with Mbeumo and Amad Diallo away, would only present Amorim with another challenge and it may be that Mount's pressing higher up the pitch is deemed a more important asset to the United coach.Adam Bate",
      "\"In the first half they were by far the better team and surprisingly, I thought with Martinez in midfield in the second half, they were the equal of [Aston] Villa as a minimum.\"",
      "Those were Gary Neville's words as Lisandro Martinez was brought on at the break to replace the injured Fernandes at Villa Park.",
      "Martinez is primarily a centre-back, but has shown he can step into midfield when required. The Argentine is not unfamiliar with that position. During his time at Ajax, he was at times utilised in the middle of the park.",
      "In his 22 games as a stereotypical number six, he averaged close to 66 passes per 90 minutes with an accuracy above 86 per cent, ranked highly for final-third passes among others in those games, and still contributed defensively with solid numbers for tackles, interceptions and possessions won in the middle third.",
      "Martinez would not offer the same creativity as Fernandes, but his ability to recycle possession, read the game and maintain structure could provide a different type of balance in midfield. With fixtures coming thick and fast, his versatility gives Amorim another internal option to consider while United’s captain remains unavailable.Sam Cohen",
      "With Casemiro suspended against Aston Villa, it was left to Manuel Ugarte to try and slot in next to Fernandes, though he did little to rubber stamp his credentials.",
      "Ugarte once again failed to impress. He was lacklustre with and without the ball - he didn’t create any big chances or manage a single shot on target, whilst also losing the most aerial duels of any player in the game.",
      "Defeat on Sunday means that the Uruguayan has lost all seven of his last seven starts. To boot, an eighth loss in nine marks the longest run without a Premier League victory for a starting Man Utd player for over two decades. Only Kleberson, between January 2004 and May 2005, managed a longer winless run in a red shirt.",
      "Ugarte’s hefty £50.7m price tag has come into question frequently during his tenure in Manchester, especially given the recent success of his predecessor, Scott McTominay. The Scotsman was allowed to leave United for £26m - only half of the outlay for Ugarte.",
      "Just this weekend, McTominay won the Italian Supercoppa, his second piece of silverware since moving to Italy, off the back of being named Serie A Player of the Year last month.",
      "He likely would’ve been an ideal solution. But the man who essentially took his place in the squad has done little to silence the doubters.Noah Langford",
      "There was something noticably different about the way United set up against Aston Villa. As opposed to leading with a pressing front three and double pivot behind, Amorim opted to defensively lead with a front two and a triangle three propping up behind, including Fernandes, Mount and Ugarte.",
      "Assuming Casemiro would return in place of the latter, this could be something Amorim turns to more often. Mount or Mainoo could slot into the Fernandes role, with the other remaining further up the pitch.",
      "Should Bryan Mbeumo return from AFCON before Fernandes is fit to return, perhaps he links up with Matheus Cunha up top while Benjamin Sesko takes up an impact substitute role as he continues his adaptation to the Premier League.",
      "This would still give Mount the chance to take up an important position in the team given his growing influence on the side of late.Callum Bishop",
      "We'd be remissed not to touch upon the fact that there could be a surprise inclusion for one of United's youngsters to step into the team with Fernandes out.",
      "Jack Fletcher, son of former Red Devil and current lead coach of the club's under-18s side Darren, made his senior debut off the bench at Villa Park and has been touted as a potential star of the future. His twin brother, Tyler, also plays as a midfielder and may see a chance for himself.",
      "Eighteen-year-old Jim Thwaites has also been earning praise for his development, while Sekou Kone has had experienced training with the first-team before. Although, recent fitness struggles may set back any hopes he has of a sniff.",
      "Amorim has not long spoken about the entitlement of some of his youngsters, but now he may have to rely on them more than previously.Callum Bishop",
      "Super 6 have made a millionaire already this season, but could you be the next big winner? Enter the next round for free."
