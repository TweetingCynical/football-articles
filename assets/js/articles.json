      "Manchester United have been warned why Newcastle boss Eddie Howe is unlikely to step into Ruben Amorim's shoes should a managerial change be made. Amorim's position as United head coach has come under intense scrutiny in recent weeks, following a string of poor performances during his opening months in charge.",
      "The Red Devils headed into the international break on a high, however, after securing a 2-0 triumph against Sunderland in the Premier League. Talk surrounding Amorim's future has sparked rumours about potential successors being sounded out, with various candidates reportedly in the frame.",
      "Nevertheless, former Newcastle United midfielder Jeff Hendrick reckons United are set to persevere with Amorim for at least one more transfer window. Hendrick also outlined why he doesn't anticipate Howe accepting the role as United boss should the chance present itself.",
      "\"I would be so surprised if the Manchester United job came available and Eddie Howe took it. I think it's a really, really tough job to take now,\" Hendrick told Boyle Sports.",
      "\"They're kind of stuck. You look at Ruben Amorim coming in, and he had a good profile of what he'd done previously, but he looks disheartened.",
      "\"He looks disheartened even though he's had a summer to get a couple of signings in. I think they're better off maybe sticking with him for another transfer window, but who knows if they will.",
      "\"Touching on Eddie Howe, he's got the run of the club at Newcastle now with how well he's done. He's able to bring in the players he wants, and let go of the players he doesn't want.",
      "\"The fans love him. I don't see why he'd leave. I think for him, his target is to consistently hit Champions League football with that club.\"",
      "United's next match after the international break will see them take on bitter rivals Liverpool at Anfield on October 19. Amorim will be determined to continue their winning form when they leave Merseyside in just under two weeks time, with Liverpool on a three-game losing run including the latest two in the Premier League.",

      "Ruben Amorim was finally afforded a summer transfer window in the hope that it would improve his situation at Manchester United, but familiar issues remain even if some of his new arrivals have shown promise.",
      "The Portuguese head coach arrived midway through last season, immediately implementing his way of playing, despite not having the players that suited that style. He persevered regardless, leading to United's worst ever Premier League finish.",
      "This summer though he was able to plough more than £200million into his frontline with goals a particular problem last term. The likes of Rasmus Hojlund, Alejandro Garnacho and Antony have left with two proven top flight performers in Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha arriving at Old Trafford.",
      "Benjamin Sesko was also signed, despite huge interest from Newcastle, with the young striker eventually making the move for £74million.",
      "All the names on paper looked promising. A new goalkeeper in Senne Lammens was bought in on deadline day. His importance growing in light of Andre Onana's surprise loan move to Turkey late in the day.",
      "Paraguayan Diego Leon was also signed, he's talked up making a name for himself when he gets a chance, but he is likely to be more of a slow burner in Manchester. The overriding issue though for Amorim has been the continued failure of his system to get the right results.",
      "United's budget meant they couldn't get the midfielder they wanted, which has left Bruno Fernandes playing in the midfield two. That has given him more defensively responsibility and less attacking freedom, none of which has helped the Manchester outfit. There are plenty who believe this squad possesses good players, but they are being made to look worse by the system.",
      "Amorim saw his side beat Sunderland at the weekend, but that came after a loss at Brentford which highlighted the obvious flaws in how United are currently operating. If there are any positives it is that Cunha has looked sharp, Sesko is off the mark in front of goal and Mbeumo has had moments of quality. We take a look at United's summer arrivals and give them an early grading in Manchester.",
      "Delivered a composed first appearance in the 2-0 victory over Sunderland last weekend and looks likely to retain his position ahead of Bayindir moving forwards. Controlled his area, comfortable with both feet, reasonable ball distribution and appears to be a dependable choice between the sticks.",
      "His start at United has been slower than anticipated following his £65m transfer from Wolves. After an injury in the Burnley victory, he returned at Brentford, where his cross to Mbeumo earned a penalty that Fernandes missed. With Mount back fit, Cunha's spot is now under threat.",
      "The standout signing for United this summer. He's made an immediate impact after his £71m move from Brentford. His two goals and one assist don't fully reflect his overall contribution, as his speed and diagonal runs behind enemy lines have added a new element to United's attack.",
      "It's taken him some time to find his feet, but his two goals in the last two matches suggest he's getting there. United are playing to Sesko's strengths, using long balls for the imposing striker to flick on for his teammates, while his poacher's instincts have resulted in his goals.",

      "Liverpool are keeping tabs on Bournemouth star Antoine Semenyo, who the Cherries now value at £75million with the winger enjoying another stellar season, which began with a brace at Anfield.",
      "Semenyo chose to remain at the Vitality Stadium in the summer despite seeing some of his big name team-mates move on after impressive years. The Reds are now weighing up a move with sporting director Richard Hughes also a big admirer of Semenyo having signed him from Bristol City when he was at Bournemouth.",
      "Semenyo then cost just £10.5m, but could now move on for more than seven times that given his continued rise at Bournemouth, reports talkSPORT. His stellar start to the season will only see the Cherries believe their hefty price tag is justified.",
      "The Ghanaian has six goals to his name, with only Erling Haaland above him across the Premier League. His individual quality has continued to aid Andoni Iraola's side as they again sit among the top sides.",
      "Manchester United weighed up a move for Semenyo in the summer, as did Tottenham, and it is understood that the Red Devils continue to keep tabs on the player. However he ended up signing a new deal with Bouremouth and Ruben Amorim instead landed Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo.",
      "The United boss is reported to have met Semenyo for dinner in London at the end of last season to get a gauge on the player's character. CEO Omar Berrada and transfer chief Jason Wilcox also held conversations with Bournemouth over the former Bristol star, but nothing ultimately came of it.",
      "United were ready to fork out £55m to sign Semenyo, who scored 13 times last season. However, the player himself is said to have committed his future to Bournemouth after learning that the Manchester outfit were planning to pay him less than what they offered to other targets.",
      "Liverpool's interest in Semenyo may be viewed as something of a surprise, especially given their number of attacking players and the current struggles with trying to fit them into an effective line-up. Hugo Ekitike, Alexander Isak and Florian Wirtz were all signed in the summer.",
      "They complement Mohamed Salah and Cody Gakpo, who were already at the club. One player who did swap Bournemouth for Liverpool recently was Milos Kerkez, but the Hungarian has so far found it difficult to replicate his level at Anfield with Andy Robertson often playing ahead of him.",

      "The Three Lions are currently preparing for a big friendly against Wales on Thursday before a World Cup qualifier with Latvia next week. And while the usual faces were involved in training on the eve of England's game with Wales, it has now emerged that three up-and-coming stars were also at St. Georges' Park, including Lacey.",
      "Lacey, 18, is one of Manchester United's most promising prospects and has already caught the eye among the Red Devils coaching staff. Per The Mail, United's young attacking midfielder was also joined by Lakyle Samuel, a 19-year-old Manchester City defender who has impressed on loan in League Two with Bromley, and Harrison Murray-Campbell, also 19 and a defender for Chelsea.",
      "Lacey was handed a squad number - 61 - ahead of the 2025-26 campaign and featured for United in pre-season. He, Samuel and Murray-Campbell have all been named in the England Under-20 squad and could feature when they face Switzerland on Friday.",
      "While Lacey and Co were involved on Wednesday, there was no Harry Kane on the St. Georges' Park pitches as the England captain is struggling with an ankle knock.",
      "Kane did not participate in training with the rest of his team-mates after suffering a knock in Bayern Munich's 3-0 win over against Eintracht Frankfurt. And the 32-year-old, who was replaced by Nicolas Jackson after receiving treatment late in the game, is now a major doubt for England's big game with Wales.",
      "He joined Jarell Quansah by taking part in an indoor routine at St. Georges' Park and could be replaced by Ollie Watkins or Marcus Rashford in Tuchel's starting XI on Thursday night.",
      "His absence will come as a blow to Tuchel, who lauded the former Tottenham talisman as the \"best striker of his generation\" recently. Speaking to Sport Bild, the England boss said: “He is undoubtedly the best striker of his generation. He has reached a new level and is now scoring two goals per game.",
      "“He’s in full flow; you can feel the confidence he carries Bayern Munich and the Three Lions with ease on his shoulders. He’s in top form, and I’m glad to have him as captain.”",

      "Andre Onana is enjoying huge benefit from his loan spell away from Manchester United, but still plans to return to the Premier League side when his stint in Turkey is over.",
      "The Cameroon goalkeeper was surprisingly let go by the Red Devils after deadline day as they sanctioned a move to Trabzonspor, who are covering his £170,000 weekly wages in full. A new environment looks to be paying off for the goalkeeper, who endured a difficult two years at Old Trafford.",
      "Signed by Erik ten Hag, his time in Manchester was defined by high profile errors that often led to goals. His position came under threat when he didn't start the year as No 1 and Ruben Amorim opted to sign Senne Lammens late in the window.",
      "However The Sun reports that Onana is \"feeling the love\" in Turkey and that is helping him rediscover his best form. Those close to Onana admit the goalkeeper was mentally low after two challenging seasons.",
      "The ex-Inter Milan No 1 feels more relaxed and has regained confidence at Trabzonspor, who are second in the Turkish league behind champions Galatasaray, and they are exploring the possibility of signing him on a permanent basis.",
      "Onana's intention though is to make a return to Manchester, where he will hope to re-establish himself as their No 1. The goalkeeper privately accepts he struggled at United, despite often coming out to defend his actions and his record, even if he was dropped by Amorim last term.",
      "His last appearance for the Premier League side came as they were beaten on penalties by Grimsby Town in the Carabao Cup. The loss at Blundell Park is one of the lowest points in recent memory with Onana making another blunder and struggling to stop any spot kicks.",
      "Amorim confessed that a change of scenery was best for all involved. He said: “We saw Andre had a very, very good season at Inter. The quality is there. But we are in the club and sometimes, in the moment, things can get harder and harder. You can be really experienced but in this club, the pressure is sometimes so hard on every detail.",
      "“I think we understood that this needed a change. Sometimes it's hard to point why. It's the performance, the moments. The bad luck in some moments was hard on him, was hard on us. Our thinking is to have a change in the goalkeepers.”",

      "After the club's worst-ever Premier League season in 24/25 - and a summer spree which eclipsed £200million - there were hopes for a quick star to ease pressure on Ruben Amorim.",
      "Victories against Burnley, Chelsea and Sunderland have been overshadowed by disappointing losses to Arsenal, Manchester City and Brentford, alongside a stalemate at Fulham.",
      "With the second international interval of the campaign now here, chief Manchester United writer David McDonnell examines how United's squad have performed so far..",
      "Altay Bayindir 6: Didn't cover himself in glory in the defeats to Arsenal and Burnley, but looked much better in the defeat to Brentford. Now appears to have lost his place.",
      "Senne Lammens 8: Delivered a composed first appearance in the 2-0 victory over Sunderland last weekend and looks likely to retain his position ahead of Bayindir moving forwards.",
      "Controlled his area, comfortable with both feet, reasonable ball distribution and appears to be a dependable choice between the sticks.",
      "Luke Shaw 6: Has experienced an up and down start to the season. Criticised by Roy Keane for \"stealing a living\" after a below-par showing in the 3-0 derby thrashing at Manchester City, was outstanding versus Chelsea, disappointing once more at Brentford and improved against Sunderland. Needs to find some consistency.",
      "Harry Maguire 6: Like Shaw, he's had a mixed start to the season. Despite a solid performance in the victory over Chelsea, he was at fault for Brentford's first goal in United's 3-1 defeat and was subsequently benched for the Sunderland win. He's struggling to secure a spot in United's preferred back three.",
      "Matthijs De Ligt 8: The most reliable defender for United this season, and has played every minute of the season so far. Whether centrally or on the right of a back three, De Ligt's defensive prowess and positional awareness have been standout features.",
      "Leny Yoro 7: He's carved out a role as United's top choice on the right of a back three, so it's baffling why he started the matches against Chelsea and Brentford on the bench, only to be brought back for Sunderland. He remains cool under pressure and skilled with the ball.",
      "Diogo Dalot 6: Kicked off the season at right wing-back and set up Mbeumo's goal in the Burnley win, but an injury saw him miss the City and Chelsea matches. He returned to the starting line-up at Brentford, where two of their three goals came from his side. Too inconsistent.",
      "Patrick Dorgu 5: Despite starting five of United's seven league games, he's yet to prove himself as a left wing-back. His final delivery needs work and despite having more touches in the opposition box (12) than any other player in the Manchester derby, he failed to capitalise on them.",
      "Noussair Mazraou 6: Currently on the injury list and has only managed two Premier League starts. United are certainly feeling the absence of his physical presence and ball-playing skills from the back.",
      "Ayden Heaven 5: Limited to a mere three minutes in the Premier League and 64 minutes in the EFL Cup exit at Grimsby. Struggling for game time with a lack of fixtures.",
      "Casemiro 6: His reckless fouls resulted in a red card just before half-time in the victory over Chelsea, cancelling out United's one-man advantage after Robert Sanchez's early dismissal. Amorim's lack of faith in Mainoo and Ugarte has seen him get the nod, but his recklessness in challenges is worrying.",
      "Bruno Fernandes 6: He hasn't looked comfortable or effective being deployed in a deeper midfield role alongside Casemiro, rather than his preferred advanced position, where he can have a greater impact on the attack. Missed two of his last three penalties for United.",
      "Mason Mount 7: After two seasons plagued by injuries, could this be the year Mount finally stays fit and justifies his £55m transfer fee? Scored a stunning opener in the win over Sunderland and received a standing ovation when subbed, following his impressive performance. Needs to stay injury-free.",
      "Manuel Ugarte 4: Bafflingly started the Manchester derby ahead of Casemiro and was too easy for City to play through, offering no protection for the defence. It was a similar story at Brentford. Hard to see him staying beyond this season.",
      "Kobbie Mainoo 5: Yet to make a Premier League start this season, his loan request was turned down by United. It's tough to assess a player with such limited game time. His heavy touch led to Brentford's third goal after he was subbed on.",
      "Matheus Cunha 6: His start at United has been slower than anticipated following his £65m transfer from Wolves. After an injury in the Burnley victory, he returned at Brentford, where his cross to Mbeumo earned a penalty that Fernandes missed. With Mount back fit, Cunha's spot is now under threat.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo 8: The standout signing for United this summer. He's made an immediate impact after his £71m move from Brentford. His two goals and one assist don't fully reflect his overall contribution, as his speed and diagonal runs behind enemy lines have added a new element to United's attack.",
      "Benjamin Sesko 7: It's taken him some time to find his feet, but his two goals in the last two matches suggest he's getting there. United are playing to Sesko's strengths, using long balls for the imposing striker to flick on for his teammates, while his poacher's instincts have resulted in his goals.",
      "Amad 6: Has found it difficult to replicate his impressive form from last season and missed the Brentford loss due to a family bereavement. Signs of a return to form were seen in the Sunderland victory, where he came close to scoring.",
      "Joshua Zirkzee 5: The Dutch forward's chances were always going to be limited with the triple signing of Cunha, Mbeumo and Sesko, resulting in him only making three substitute appearances in the league.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Joshua Zirkzee is reportedly considering his future at Manchester United ahead of January. The forward arrived at Old Trafford in the summer of 2024, when former manager Erik ten Hag was at the club, from Bologna in a transfer worth up to £36.8million (€42.5million).",
      "Zirkzee has netted seven goals in 53 outings for the Red Devils, although he's yet to score this campaign. Ruben Amorim has not given the Netherlands international a single start for United this season - with his three Premier League appearances and one Carabao Cup outing all coming from the bench.",
      "Consequently, it's suggested that Zirkzee is 'reconsidering his future' at the club. The Daily Mail have reported that Zirkzee is mulling over a departure from United during the January transfer window, having grown 'frustrated' with his limited role in the matchday squad this season.",
      "The report suggests that Zirkzee is eager to secure his place in the Netherlands squad for this summer's World Cup and, therefore, is exploring a move away from United in January to maximise his chances of selection.",
      "Juventus and PSV Eindhoven are cited both in the report as having previously shown interest during the summer window, although it's unclear whether either club could be a potential destination from the New Year. Napoli also reportedly had an interest before turning their attention to signing Hojlund instead.",
      "United approved the departures of Marcus Rashford, Hojlund, Jadon Sancho, Antony and Alejandro Garnacho during the summer transfer window as they overhauled their attacking options. Whether Zirkzee will part ways with United in January or reclaim his spot in the starting XI before the New Year remains to be seen.",
      "Despite being brought on board as a striker, Zirkzee frequently stepped into the No. 10 role last season following Amorim's arrival as head coach. However, the additions of Benjamin Sesko, Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo to the squad, coupled with Mason Mount's impressive form, has seen Zirkzee tumble down the pecking order.",
      "United's next match will see them travel to face bitter rivals Liverpool in the Premier League, on October 19, after the international break and it remains to be seen if Zirkzee will get any minutes, or a start, in the fixture at Anfield.",

      "The 22-year-old would have undoubtedly felt the weight of expectation after his hefty transfer from RB Leipzig, especially given the added scrutiny due to issues plaguing his fellow strikers. Sesko emerged as the latest star to grace the Theatre of Dreams, rejecting Newcastle United for a whopping £74million deal in the summer transfer window.",
      "United managed to clinch the deal for Sesko, putting an end to the protracted transfer saga that saw Arsenal as the initial favourites. Both Amorim and Eddie Howe's teams were locked in a fierce battle to bring him to the Premier League.",
      "United's recruitment strategy has faced criticism in recent years, following a series of unsuccessful transfers accompanied by staggering financial expenditure. Sesko's arrival paved the way for Ramus Hojlund's loan move to Napoli, as part of their plan to bolster their attacking prowess, following a disappointing goal tally from their forwards, last season.",
      "However, early indications suggest that Sesko is a hit, earning accolades from figures across the region, including United legend Wayne Rooney.",
      "The former striker believes that the Slovenian not only poses a threat in attack but also enhances the performance of those around him.",
      "\"I think he's a handful, and he uses his body well,\" said the former England captain.",
      "\"He challenges for balls, and it makes it easier for Mbeumo, Cunha when he's on, or Mount to make runs in behind him. So I think that's clearly something they've worked on.",

      "\"Sesko has been good at winning headers in the air, and Mbeumo running in behind him. So I actually thought Manchester United got the tactics right.\"",
      "It's not only ex-United stars singing his praises - current players are also gushing about his progress following a tricky start to life in England.",
      "Leeds United's Slovenian defender Jaka Bijol praised Sesko for battling through the 'brutal' nature of English football and the Premier League, telling local media Ekipa: \"I'm very happy that he found his way. Because the people in England are quite ruthless. And I'm very happy for him that this pressure has at least fallen off his shoulders a little.",
      "\"I hope it continues like this and that he'll already be scoring the goals we need for our current aims in the national team shirt.",
      "\"It's true there's a rivalry between us, so I hope these words won't be translated too much or misunderstood.",
      "\"I'm happy for Benjamin. I can't be for Manchester United [laughs], but the derby will come soon and I'll be able to say more then.\"",

      "Harry Maguire's retrial in Greece has been postponed for the fourth time with the Manchester United star now having to wait until March next year to clear his name.",
      "It has been more than five years since the England defender was arrested on the Greek island of Mykonos. The much-delayed hearing was due to begin in Syros on Wednesday morning and Maguire’s defence team were in court ready to defend the Englishman. However the wait will go on and extend into next year.",
      "A possibility exist that Maguire's case will never come to trial at all because the statute of limitations in Greece takes effect after eight years, which would be in August 2028, reports the Daily Mail.",
      "Maguire was arrested in the summer of 2020 following an altercation on a family holiday and convicted of assaulting a police officer and attempted bribery. He was handed a 21-month suspended sentence, but the conviction was automatically quashed on appeal under Greek law.",
      "The 32-year-old does not have a criminal record as his original conviction was 'nullified'. He insists he is innocent.",
      "Maguire did not have to attend the trial in person. The first delay came back in May 2023 because his defence counsel was unavailable. Later in in February 2024 it was put back due to the Greek lawyers’ strike and then again in March of this year it was delayed.",
      "The defender was originally found guilty of repeated bodily harm, attempted bribery, violence against public employees and insult. His brother Joe, 33, and pal Christopher Sharman, 34, were accused of clashing with rival fans and police outside a nightclub. Joe Maguire and Sharman got a 13-month suspended sentence. All three deny the charges.",
      "A source close to the United star previously said: “Harry is frustrated this is continuing to drag on after more than five years. Whist he remains determined and confident that he will clear his name, he remains bemused his fundamental defence rights have not begun to be addressed.”",
      "In an interview about the incident following his return to the UK in 2020, Maguire said: “Some people will believe me, some people won't. But one thing I would say about Mykonos is that I have no regrets. My conscience is so clear about what happened that night.\"",
      "Maguire has continued to focus on his football and remains a crucial part of the squad in Manchester. He's currently enjoying some downtime during the international break with his England snub continuing. He's not played for the Three Lions for 13 months.",

Mateta has won the FA Cup and the Community Shield in recent months, with those exploits earning him a France call-up.",
      "Mateta moved to Selhurst Park as an unknown quantity from Mainz in 2022 and, after a slow start, has hit his straps in recent years under Oliver Glasner. The Frenchman scored 17 goals in all competitions last term - which came after he'd score 19 the year prior to that.",
      "Palace have seen some of their major names - the likes of Michael Olise and Eberechi Eze - move on in more recent years when big clubs came calling. Mateta is now rubbing shoulders with some major names in the Les Blues set-up and insists he wants to go as far as he can in his career.",
      "He was asked whether he would like to 'move up a gear' to join an elite club and told RMC Sport: \"It's natural, every ambitious player wants to reach that milestone.",

They only tasted defeat for the first time at the weekend and the Frenchman has become one of their key figures ahead of a season in the Europa Conference League, where lifting the trophy could open up evem more possibilities.",
      "Manchester United were previously urged to sign Mateta before they settled on Benjamin Sesko in the summer. They spent more than £70m to land the Slovenian but Sam Allardyce insists the Palace No 14 would've been ideal for them.",
      "He said on the No Tippy Tappy Football podcast: \"Do you know who I’d have bought, more than anybody else? Mateta, absolutely. The centre-forward is absolutely brilliant and why they didn’t buy him, I don’t know, especially when the big strikers are coming back [into fashion].\"",

      "Cristiano Ronaldo has become football’s first-ever billionaire after signing a blockbuster new contract in Saudi Arabia. The former Manchester United and Real Madrid star completed a stunning move to the Middle East in 2013.",
      "After leaving Old Trafford, Ronaldo penned a record-breaking £173m-per-year deal with Al-Nassr. But he was then handed an even more lucrative contract after agreeing to fresh terms in Saudi Arabia.",
      "The 40-year-old is now set to bank around £492m over the next two years - with that amount having seen him surpass the billion pound mark. According to Bloomberg, Ronaldo’s net worth has now risen to $1.4billion (£1.045bn) which sees him become the first-ever footballer to do that..",
      "Some have criticised Ronaldo’s motivation for moving to Saudi Arabia, with it being claimed that it was purely driven by money. But the forward has regularly backed the league, suggesting that it has the potential to surpass some of Europe’s best.",
      "After signing his new contract, he said: \"Of course, we [the Saudi Pro League] are still improving but I believe that in this moment that we are in top five [leagues in the world ] already. I still believe that we will continue to improve, and we have time and we have shown in the last two years that the league is going up all the time.",
      "\"I am happy because I know that the league is very competitive. Only the people who have never played in Saudi, they don't understand nothing about football say this league is not top five [in the world].",
      "\"I believe 100% in my words, and the people that play in this league they know what I am talking about.\"",
      "While he is currently still performing, the question of retirement has regularly been put to the veteran forward. After being given an award in Portugal, Ronaldo said: \"I'll be honest: I don't see it as an obsession.",
      "“If you'd asked me 20 years ago, I might have answered differently, like I wanted to eat the world, but now I don't see things that way. Age also allows us to think differently.",
      "“It's like I said, I have a philosophy of living day by day. In everyday life, things change in a moment. You can't make long-term plans. Right now, I make short-term plans because it gives me more energy that way, more of a desire to live.",
      "“I enjoy each day, training session by training session and competition by competition. Then, down the road, we'll see.\"",

      "Manchester United ace Marcus Rashford's transfer value is on a downward spiral despite enjoying a successful stint at Barcelona so far. After his loan spell at Aston Villa, Rashford expressed his desire to leave United during the summer transfer window.",
      "His wish was granted when an agreement was struck with his preferred club - the Catalan behemoth, Barcelona. Barca agreed to foot the bill for Rashford's wages in full, bringing him to the club on a loan deal.",
      "The La Liga side, managed by Hansi Flick, also have the option to make the England international's move permanent next summer for a fee around £26.2million. Since making his debut, Rashford has hit the ground running, netting three goals and providing five assists in ten appearances - including a double against Newcastle in the Champions League.",
      "However, despite his promising start to the season, his transfer value continues to tumble, according to transfer experts. As of last week, Rashford's value is said to stand at a mere £34.72million. The forward hasn't seen his value dip below £43.4million since he was a teenager back in 2017.",
      "Back then, he was valued just over £26million, but his worth would soar within a year. Rashford's transfer value reached its zenith in 2021 when it hit a staggering £73.77million.",
      "Whilst his market worth remains higher than what United could potentially pocket should he make his Barcelona switch permanent at the season's close, the Reds possess limited scope to secure a more lucrative deal.",
      "After completing his loan stint in La Liga, Rashford will still have two years left to run on his Old Trafford contract, and having already made clear his intentions to seek pastures new, United find themselves with precious little leverage to demand a heftier transfer fee.",
      "Barcelona have already made it crystal clear that they're under no compulsion to make Rashford's move permanent should they choose not to. Nevertheless, their sporting director Deco suggested the early indicators are promising for the Wythenshawe-born forward.",
      "\"There's no penalty clause in the loan agreement if we don't sign him,\" he revealed to Mundo Deportivo. \"We do have an option to make it permanent if we want to. It's too early to talk about decisions for next season. What matters is that we're happy with him.\"",
      "While it has been claimed that Barcelona may try to secure Rashford for even less than £26m, Mirror Sport understands they value him much higher and believe the option represents a 'bargain' deal, especially after his eight goal contributions from 10 games.",
      "A Barca source said: \"At the top of his game, Marcus Rashford is one of the best players in Europe. Barca have got themselves a genuine bargain. Marcus should be worth more than £60m in the current market.\"",

      "His long-term future in Manchester continues to be a talking point, especially with the coach so wedded to his philosophy, which has failed to result in an upturn in form. ESPN reports that CEO Omar Berrada and director of football Jason Wilcox have spoken to members of the squad - including captain Bruno Fernandes as well as the leadership group - and they believe support still exists for Amorim.",
      "Conversations were not formal and the individuals were not deliberately 'sounded out' ahead of a decision on Amorim, who has a contract with the club until 2027 and is only just about to mark 12 months in the job.",
      "Mason Mount has said that the dressing room is \"100% behind the gaffer\" despite the early struggles. Defender Matthijs de Ligt also publicly backed Amorim following the 3-1 defeat at Brentford less than a fortnight ago.",
      "Any decision to sack Amorim would involve Sir Jim Ratcliffe and Joel Glazer. Omar Berrada and Jason Wilcox would also be asked for their input having been hands-on in the decisions that have been taken by the club. They have been active in trying to understand what the mood is at the club.",
      "Both men are based at the Carrington training base and that has given them a greater insight. It has also allowed them to have constant communication with Amorim and the squad, owing to the communal areas in the new training centre.",
      "The United boss has continued to cut a defiant figure when questioned about his future - and has maintained that his playing style is not the reasons for their struggles.",
      "He said: \"You fear to lose your job when you have to pay the bills and I don't have that feeling. I just want to continue this. But when we don't win games, that is the suffering that I have. It is not the fear of losing the job. I don't care.",
      "Amorim also added: \"I think we are thinking about the system but I think we need to look at all of the parts of the game. This team play in the different systems for many years, and you were talking about the lack of identity, no idea, whatever.\"",

      "Manchester United great Paul Scholes has identified his ideal recruit to replace Ruben Amorim at the club's helm. The international break may be viewed as an opportunity for respite for the under-fire tactician, but the rumour mill continues to whirl around who might succeed Amorim if he's fired.",
      "A run of three straight home wins have handed the Portuguese tinkerer a reprieve for the time being. But even some of Amorim's latest remarks struck the wrong nerve with another United legend, Gary Neville.",
      "As he approaches his first anniversary at the Old Trafford helm, Amorim is subject to fierce discussion over how long he'll last. But in the event Sir Jim Ratcliffe makes the decision to change the guard, Scholes knows who he'd want in charge.",
      "And the 11-time Premier League champion was in no doubt when the topic arose on the latest episode of The Overlap. After a fan's suggestion United could force a change during the international break, Scholes was quick to fire back with his choice. \"Eddie Howe, Eddie Howe,\" he said. \"I’m not sure about his mate [assistant manager Jason Tindall], but definitely him.\"",
      "Clearly impressed with the work Howe has done in reviving Newcastle, Scholes' hope is he could do the same at Old Trafford. Granted, the Magpies' flight up the Premier League pecking order has coincided with Saudi Arabia's PIF taking over the club, but his CV speaks for itself regardless.",
      "Howe boasts a win ratio of 50.31% at Newcastle, the highest any permanent Newcastle coach working only in the top flight has managed since Kevin Keegan's first stint ended in 1997. Given what he's done with the riches offered by his Saudi bosses, there's reason to believe Scholes is correct that he could put United's riches to better use.",
      "Despite heading into the break on the back of a 2-0 win over Sunderland, it's not all rosy at United. That's after Amorim took aim at the media prior to that match, suggesting the frequent criticism of the 3-4-3 system he insists on using is having an impact.",
      "\"My players, I guarantee you, they are listening to all the opinions and they are putting that inside because we are not winning games,\" said Amorim before the Sunderland fixture. \"They have to believe in me. So my biggest problem is that my players believe in you guys when you say the problem of our team is the system.\"",
      "The critiques of Amorim's structure and whether United have the players to make it work has been relentless of late. However, Neville took aim at the current crop of talent, as well as the coach for fostering an \"excuse mentality.\"",
      "He continued: \"Do people not remember Alan Hansen criticising us when we broke in as young kids saying that you can’t win anything with kids? That was the greatest centre-back of all time at that moment talking about us as if we were, you know, inferior and nowhere near good enough.\"",
      "Neville's criticism was as much directed at Amorim's squad as it was the manager himself. And the former England international picked the players apart for allowing that criticism to affect their performances, if Amorim's comments are indeed accurate.",
      "He asked: \"Did they not think that we got criticised during our football careers? I’m sorry, you’re playing for Manchester United, it comes with the territory, you’ve got to step up.\"",
      "Amorim's stubborn outlook in defence of his preferred formation has become a focal point of late. However, Neville examined United's situation on a wider scale and called on both the manager and his personnel to simply win matches by any means necessary.",
      "\"They’ve been hopeless in the system,\" he added. \"If it’s not the system, then the players are a problem, the manager is a problem, the whole thing’s a problem if you’re losing football matches to the level that they’ve been doing.\"",

      "Manchester United splashed the cash this summer, particularly in the forward areas, in a bid to revamp Ruben Amorim's attack, with Benjamin Sesko being the marquee signing. The 22-year-old sensation made his way to Old Trafford from RB Leipzig for an initial fee of £66.3m.",
      "That transfer fee could rise to £74million if add-ons are met, with United beating off competition from Newcastle United for his signature earlier this summer.",
      "Despite a slow start at United, Amorim is beginning to see the potential Sesko brings to the squad as we head into the international break, with the forward netting a goal in each of his last two Premier League matches.",
      "He found the back of the net in the 3-1 loss to Brentford but also scored the second goal in United's 2-0 victory over Sunderland last weekend.",
      "United have had difficulty finding the back of the net in recent seasons, with Rasmus Hojlund, Joshua Zirkzee and Marcus Rashford all struggling to score consistently.",
      "Two of these three players departed the club this summer, leaving Sesko with the responsibility of being the main goal scorer.",
      "As of October 6th, CIES Football Observatory values the Slovenian international between €109m-€119m (£94.6m-£103.33m).",
      "The striker is now the club's most valuable player, having arrived from RB Leipzig, with that 'fair price' considerably higher than what the club paid for him earlier this summer.",
      "If you rewind to June 19th, earlier this year, a 'fair price' for the forward was considered to be in the region of €90m-€117m (£78.1m-£101.9m).",
      "Despite Ineos and United paying a lower price for him, both 'fair price' valuations are significantly higher, with the increase in that lower bracket of £78.1m to £94.6m suggesting his value will only rise if he keeps scoring goals.",
      "Ahead of the break, Sesko hinted at more impressive performances in the future. \"No, not yet,\" he told MUTV when asked if we were beginning to see his best form at United.",

The winger got his wish when he sealed a season-long switch to Barcelona this summer, hoping to flourish in La Liga under Hansi Flick's guidance.",
      "But former United captain Keane harboured serious reservations about his chances of succeeding at the Nou Camp. Discussing the summer transfer dealings on the Stick to Football podcast back in August, Gary Neville said: \"Last one is Marcus Rashford to Barcelona.",
      "\"I know it's not a big signing in terms of the Premier League but it's an amazing move for him. I mean, I hope he does well.",
      "\"I think that him leaving is a poor reflection upon the club, but also him in terms of how it's gone in the last few years. But I just hope he can get his career back on track. What a move.\"",
      "However, Keane shared doubts about Rashford's footballing IQ at the time, responding: \"Do you reckon he's got enough football intelligence to go over there and adapt to a different league, different football, different lifestyle? Has he got that intelligence on and off the pitch to to make it work?",
      "\"He's obviously a talented boy. We know his strengths and that is running in behind. He kind of stopped doing that a little bit.\"",
      "Neville then suggested that Rashford could flourish with Barca due to the club's tendency to control possession. He added: \"Well I think Roy, you're in Barcelona. It's maybe because I'm thinking of Barcelona 10 years ago.",
      "\"I know it's slightly different now but they dominate a lot of games whereby they are high up the pitch and you've got teams behind the ball and you think Marcus is better when he's playing in a counterattacking system. So when you're playing in tight areas.\"",
      "However, Keane then cut across his former teammate by adding: \"That's why I think there are question marks, a little bit,\" as he remained sceptical about Rashford's compatibility with the club. It comes as Keane might be feeling somewhat embarrassed about his previous remarks, following Rashford's brilliant beginning with his new team - who are reportedly considering the prospect of making the transfer permanent without triggering United's £26.2million clause built into his contract.",
      "Reports suggest that the Catalan giants are keen to negotiate a lower fee as the season unfolds, or even secure a second consecutive loan spell for 2026/27. However, it's unclear whether United would be open to further negotiations or another temporary departure from Old Trafford.",
      "Since his transfer, Rashford has scored three times and provided five assists across all competitions. The club currently holds the second spot in the La Liga table as they head into a two-week international break. Rashford will be eager to continue his good form when Barcelona resume their campaign against Girona on Saturday, October 18.",

      "Anthony Gordon has described his main rival for an England starting place as ‘unbelievable’ and given a fascinating insight into a player who has divided opinion in recent years. Thomas Tuchel has always been a fan of Marcus Rashford but gave Gordon the nod for the 5-0 win in Serbia last month.",
      "But Rashford did score in that stunning victory in Belgrade, having replaced Gordon midway through the second half and converted a late penalty. And Gordon, 24, has nothing but admiration for the Manchester United attacker, currently on loan at Barcelona.",
      "The Newcastle United attacker said: “I think his mindset is unbelievable. People have written him off and he’s been through so much over the past couple of years.",
      "“To get back to these levels … people will never understand how hard that is to do. He deserves a lot of credit.",
      "“He’s a lovely guy. He’s quiet, nice and just goes about his business. The perception of him outside is quite crazy. He’s a nice, polite lad.”",
      "Rashford, 27, is enjoying his time with Barcelona, scoring twice in their win at St James’ Park in the Champions League. And Gordon believes his success in Spain shows a strong character.",
      "“As humans, when someone is successful, we want to knock them off their perch,” said Gordon. “When you are so successful so young, people almost get bored a little bit and move you on and look for the next one to come through.",
      "“That’s why it’s a testament to his mentality that he hasn’t let that happen. He’s still playing for England, Barcelona and in the Champions League. It’s a testament to his character.”",
      "One area in which Rashford would appear to have the edge over Gordon is the goalscoring department. Rashford has scored 18 times in 64 international appearances - Gordon has one in 14.",
      "And the Newcastle man knows that is a record that needs to be improved. And that is why he is picking the brains of Harry Kane.",
      "“When I watch Harry finish, it’s not accidental why he scores so many goals. He’s so locked into practice, he’s so focused,” said Gordon.",
      "“It’s not a big secret that I’m not very good at heading the ball so I went to him at the last camp and asked him if he could give me any tips on scoring a header, because I was missing loads. He gave me a good tip that I’ll keep between us.",
      "\"But I’ve definitely improved since then. I probably do his head in most of the time, to be honest, but I try and just pick anything I can from him because he's a genius.”",
      "And in his new club team-mate Nick Woltemade, Gordon sees a hint of Kane, saying: “I do think they play a very similar style of football, in terms of they want to almost be the quarterback. They want to come in and create - they don’t just want to finish the chances like a typical striker would do.”",
      "And the regular taker was mightily impressed with the way Woltemade converted a penalty against Nottingham Forest in last weekend's Premier League game after Gordon had been substituted.",
      "“It was top,” said Gordon. “I was a bit gutted to be off the pitch because I couldn’t take it. He did extremely well - it was a big moment for him but he is in great form. Long may it continue.”",
      "But will Gordon retain penalty duties for Newcastle after Woltemade’s eye-catching spot-kick? “Of course,” smiles the Scouser.",

They've both impressed the ex-United defender, who says he was crying out for his former club to sign both players prior to their moves to Arsenal and Chelsea.",

      "\"I thought Caicedo would've been magnificent for Manchester United given time, while Declan would've been a ridiculous signing. It's splitting hairs between the two, I'll be honest.",
      "\"It depends what position you're going to play them in, if you're playing them as a holding midfielder, I'd probably say Caicedo. As a number eight, then I'd say Declan.",

      "Oliver Glasner continues to be linked with Manchester United – and now Adam Wharton has cast fresh doubt over his manager's Crystal Palace future. Ruben Amorim remains under pressure despite a 2-0 win over Sunderland at Old Trafford on Saturday.",
      "Glasner is just one of a number of names who have been linked with replacing Amorim should he be sacked by the United hierarchy. The Austrian has already entered the last 12 months of his contract at Selhurst Park and revealed last week he is yet to be offered a new deal.",
      "And Wharton admitted: \"Obviously there is always speculation with people's contracts coming up, but you've seen the impact he's had here and the way we are playing, so the longer he stays, the better I think.",
      "\"But anything could happen, so we will see.\"",
      "Speaking to the Austrian edition of Kicker recently, Glasner refused to rule out replacing Amorim at Old Trafford. He said: \"I follow all the rumours - and that's all there is - neutrally and completely relaxed.",
      "\"Focusing on the daily work with my players and coaches, and trying to enjoy it as much as possible.\"",
      "But speaking after the victory over the Black Cats, Mason Mount insisted that his team-mates are backing Amorim to turn things around. He said: \"We're 100% behind the gaffer.",
      "\"We've had some results that hurt us - the team, the staff and the fans - but that was important today. It needs to be the start of building something.",
      "\"We thought after winning against Chelsea it would be the start of something and then we go to Brentford and have a disappointing result.",
      "\"It starts today and we'll be working hard over the break. We want to get back-to-back wins, then three in a row and push on for the top four.\"",
      "However, Jamie Carragher believes that it is 'inevitable' that Amorim will be sacked by United before Christmas.",
      "\"I don't like saying a manager should be sacked – it's disrespectful and it's a man's job – but I'm at that point where I do think Ruben Amorim's job is untenable,\" he said, speaking on The Overlap Fan Debate, brought to you by Sky Bet.",
      "\"It's inevitable that this is going to happen before Christmas. His stats are unbelievable for a Manchester United manager – 50 games as Manchester United manager, he's only scored two more goals than he's conceded.\"",

The United hierarchy have repeatedly told the 40-year-old that he is their man for the long term, but Ferdinand believes that stance would have been tested had his old side suffered defeat at Old Trafford.",

      "Manchester United boss Ruben Amorim will already know his starting line-up for the trip to arch rivals Liverpool a week on Sunday.",
      "Injuries permitting, which is always the concern when players are released for international duty, Amorim knows the personnel he will deploy at Anfield as he seeks back-to-back league wins for the first time since taking charge nearly a year ago.",
      "United's 2-0 win over Sunderland has given Amorim the template to go to the home of the reigning champions and try to secure a first victory at Anfield since a Wayne Rooney strike secured a 1-0 win there back in 2016.",
      "In goal, there is no reason to change Senne Lammens after the 23-year-old's assured debut against Sunderland, which had United fans chanting “Are you Schmeichel in disguise?” given how well he commanded his area and repelled everything thrown at him.",
      "For his back three, Amorim must go with Leny Yoro, Matthijs De Ligt and Luke Shaw, just as he did against the Black Cats. Shaw may not have been as impressive as Yoro and De Ligt this season, not least in the defeats to Manchester City and Brentford, but he is the best option on the left side of defence and brings balance to the back three, not to mention experience of hostile atmospheres like Anfield.",
      "Amorim's midfield four at Anfield will surely be Amad on the right, Casemrio and Bruno Fernandes in the middle, with Diogo Dalot operating at left wing-back. Patrick Dorgu started the Sunderland win on the bench, coming for Dalot in the second-half, and there seems little reason for Amorim to change that around, given the latter offers more than the former, offensively and defensively.",
      "United skipper Fernandes may not be at his marauding best in the deeper midfield role to which Amorim has assigned him this season, but he will remain there for the time being and the team will need his energy and omnipresence to achieve some semblance of control against Arne Slot's side, who have suffered three successive defeats and are therefore uncharacteristically vulnerable.",
      "Mason Mount has played his way into the starting line-up, at the expense of Matheus Cunha, following his goal-scoring, all-action display against Sunderland, which offered a timely reminder of his enduring quality and value when he is fully fit, which has been all too rare during his two years at United.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo will also maintain his record of starting every Premier League game since his £71m move from Brentford, given the immediate impact he has made since joining and the different dimension he brings to the attack, with his pace, physicality and dangerous runs in behind defences.",
      "Up front, 6ft 4in fellow summer signing Benjamin Sesko has settled in after a slow start and will be looking for his third goal in as many games against Liverpool. The Slovenia striker has grown into the role of leading United's attack and Amorim will be looking for him to make sure he is a handful for Liverpool's defenders in a game the Reds must now believe they can win.",

      "There will be upheaval while the academy building is redeveloped, meaning the Under-21s and Under-18s will use the modular building, a two-storey block behind the main building. The women's team used the same set-up during the £10m redevelopment of their facilities at Carrington.",
      "The modular building is already equipped for an elite team and staff, but it will be further developed for specific academy needs to ensure minimal disruption for the U21s and U18s.",
      "The U21s and U18s have made great starts to the season with the former top of the table and the latter second on goal difference.",
      "United sources have insisted the modular building is not a construction site-style portacabin, while also stressing that it was not possible to develop academy facilities simultaneously alongside the previous work.",
      "The first-team shared the academy building during the 12-month renovation of the main building.",

      "David joined the MEN as Chief Manchester United Writer in September 2025.",
      "Manchester United have endured a typically turbulent start to the new Premier League season, with three wins, three defeats and a draw to sit mid-table.",
      "Wins over Burnley, Chelsea and Sunderland have been undermined by defeats to Arsenal, Manchester City and Brentford, as well as a draw at Fulham.",
      "As the second international break of the season is now upon us, here's how United's players have rated so far this season:",
      "Altay Bayindir: At fault for the goal in United's opening day defeat to Arsenal at Old Trafford and also culpable for those conceded in the last-gasp 3-2 win over Burnely. Ironically made some decent saves in 3-1 loss at Brentford but always looks like he has a mistake in him. 6",
      "Senne Lammens: Made an assured debut in the 2-0 win over Sunderland last weekend and is likely to keep his place ahead of Bayindir going forward. Commanded his box, two-footed, decent distribution and looks to be a solid option between the posts. 8",
      "Luke Shaw: Has had a mixed start to the season. Called out by Roy Keane for “stealing a living” after poor display in 3-0 derby defeat at Manchester City, was excellent against Chelsea, poor again at Brentford and better against Sunderland. Needs more consistency of performance. 6",
      "Harry Maguire: Like Shaw, he has endured an up and down start to the campaign. Aggressive and solid in the win over Chelsea, was at fault for Brentford's opener in United's 3-1 defeat and benched as a result for the Sunderland win. Struggles to make United's first-choice back three. 6",
      "Matthijs De Ligt: United's most consistent defender this season, evidenced by the fact he has started all seven Premier League games and played every minute. Whether he starts centrally or on the right of a back three, De Ligt's defensive diligence and positional sense has shone through. 8",
      "Leny Yoro: Has established himself as United's best option on the right of a back three, so it remains a mystery as to why he started the games against Chelsea and Brentford on the bench, before being recalled for Sunderland. Calm under pressure and adept in possession. 7",
      "Diogo Dalot: Started the season at right wing-back and provided an assist for Mbeumo to score in the Burnley win, but injury ruled him out of the City and Chelsea games. Returned to the starting line-up at Brentford, where two of their three goals came down his flank. Too flakey. 6",
      "Patrick Dorgu: Started five of United's seven league games, but has still to convince as a left wing-back. His final ball needs improving and he had more touches in the opposition box (12) than any other player in the Manchester derby, but failed to make any of them count. 5",
      "Noussair Mazraoui: Currently injured and has been restricted to two Premier League starts. United have missed his physicality and ball-playing ability out from the back. 6",
      "Ayden Heaven: Restricted to three minutes in the Premier League and 64 minutes in the EFL Cup exit at League Two Grimsby. Struggling to get game-time with so few fixtures. 5",
      "Casemiro: Two needless fouls saw him red carded just before half-time in the win over Chelsea, negating United's one-man advantage after Robert Sanchez's early dismissal. Amorim's lack of trust in Mainoo and Ugarte has seen him get the nod, but recklessness in challenges is a concern. 6",
      "Bruno Fernandes: Has not looked happy, comfortable or effective being deployed in a deeper midfield role alongside Casemiro, rather than his more favoured advanced position, where he can wield greater attacking influence. Missed two of his last three penalties for United. 6",
      "Mason Mount: After two injury-blighted seasons at United, is this the year Mount finally stays fit and justifies his £55m transfer fee? Scored a sublime opener in the win over Sunderland and received a standing ovation when subbed, following his impressive display. Has to avoid injury. 7",
      "Manuel Ugarte: Inexplicably started the Manchester derby ahead of Casemiro and was too easy for City to play through, providing no protection for the defence. It was a similar story at Brentford. Hard to see him staying beyond this season. 4",
      "Kobbie Mainoo: Has yet to start a Premier League game this season and saw his request to go out on loan rejected by United. Hard to make a judgment on a player who has had so few minutes. Gave the ball away for Brentford's third goal with a heavy touch after coming off the bench. 5",
      "Matheus Cunha: A slower than expected start to his United career following his £65m move from Wolves. Injured in the win over Burnley, he returned at Brentford, with his cross to Mbeumo winning a penalty missed by Fernandes. Cunha's place now under threat from a fit-again Mount. 6",
      "Bryan Mbeumo: United's stand-out summer signing. Has hit the ground running following his £71m move from Brentford. Two goals and an assist do not do justice to his overall contribution, his pace and diagonal runs in behind opposition defences giving United's attack a new dimension. 8",
      "Benjamin Sesko: Has taken his time to settle, but two goals in his last two games shows he is getting there. United are playing to 6ft 4in Sesko's strengths, with long balls for him to flick-on for his fellow attackers, while his poacher's instincts from close-range have yielded his goals. 7",
      "Amad: Has struggled to reproduce his impressive form of last season and missed the defeat at Brentford due to a family bereavement. Glimpses of a return to his best came in the win over Sunderland, where he came close to scoring. 6",
      "Joshua Zirkzee: The triple arrival of Cunha, Mbeumo and Sesko was always going to limit his opportunities, with the Dutch forward restricted to three sub appearances in the league. 5",

      "Manchester United headed into the international break buoyed by a much-needed win over Sunderland.",
      "There remains work to do for United and Amorim, with a trip to Liverpool when the top flight returns set to offer an acid test.",
      "But the mood in the camp has certainly been lifted on the back of the weekend win as players head away on international football. Yet for a couple of United stars, this week offers a reminder of the uncertain future they face ahead of a potential January transfer decision.",
      "Amorim dropped Altay Bayindir for the win over Sunderland, with replacement Senne Lammens impressing and keeping a clean sheet on debut. The Belgian now looks set to retain his spot as first choice keeper and plunge Bayindir into the wilderness.",
      "The absence of European football and an early exit from the Carabao Cup mean there are far fewer opportunities for rotation at Old Trafford this term and Bayindir could see his match minutes limited.",
      "That may have a knock on effect on his international ambitions with Turkey, who are seeking a spot in the 2026 World Cup.",
      "Bayindir is one of four keepers named in Vincenzo Montella's squad for this month's internationals but the prospect of barely playing for United over the coming months would impact his chances of keeping his spot, or challenging to be the starting stopper in North America next summer.",
      "It's a similar picture for Netherlands forward Joshua Zirkzee, who has yet to start for United in the Premier League this season.",
      "The 24-year-old is behind Benjamin Sesko in the central striking pecking order and has intense competition to play as a number 10. It means Zirkzee could be set for a season on the fringes at Old Trafford and as such the frontman might assess his options come the January transfer window.",
      "Reports have already emerged suggesting the former Bologna striker might look for an exit route when the winter window opens, while Netherlands boss Ronald Koeman has again overlooked the United man for his squad this month, having issued a brutal verdict earlier this year.",
      "Speaking in March, Koeman said: \"He wasn’t in the preliminary selection because I don’t think he’s good enough at the moment. In particular, scanning when turning or passing often goes wrong. Yes, in principle, form and fitness are always leading, but that is not always possible.",
      "\"We have a lot of central defenders and midfielders, but we are somewhat limited up front. But even then, I still think that you have to earn your selection, and I think he doesn’t deserve that now, but that could be the case again in another period.\"",
      "That Koeman verdict came amid a campaign where Zirkzee played 53 matches for club and country, the drop in game time since then is unlikely to convince the Dutch chief to change his thinking.",
      "It means Zirkzee, along with Bayindir, face a World Cup dilemma ahead of the January transfer window.",

      "Good morning and welcome to the Manchester United transfer blog on Wednesday, October 8.",
      "We might only be in the midst of the second international break of the season, but build-up towards the January transfer window is well underway. Joshua Zirkzee appears to be the latest player looking towards the exit door at Old Trafford.",
      "The Dutchman has been used sparingly this season by Ruben Amorim and it's believed that Zirkzee wants to try his hand elsewhere. Marcus Rashford has remained a trending topic after his bright start to life at Barcelona with a second consecutive England call-up handed to him.",
      "Brighton's Carlos Baleba remains of interest to United with the midfielder in action alongside new signing Bryan Mbeumo and outcast Andre Onana.",
      "As always, we will keep you across any other major United developments throughout the day right here.",
      "Take a look at the latest Manchester United updates below...",
      "Carlos Baleba is one of three players currently in action likely of interest to Manchester United.",
      "Late into the summer window, enquiries for made to understand conditions of a potential deal but nothing materialised. Baleba has not completed a game this season with his withdrawal at half-time in last Sunday's draw against Wolves the third time he has been taken off at the interval.",
      "In action for Cameroon against Mauritius, he made it to 75 minutes before being replaced by United attacker Bryan Mbeumo. It is very likely that Ruben Amorim will be glad to see him not playing the full game but also keeping some match sharpness.",
      "United loannee Andre Onana played the entirety of the match but only had one save to make. Two of his appearances for Trabzonspor have been very different to that with a total of 15 saves made. He has also picked up an assist since joining.",
      "Manchester United have announced the academy building at Carrington will be redeveloped.",
      "United unveiled a £50million makeover to the main building in August and have announced plans to bring academy facilities in line with the 'leading standards' they have for the first-team.",
      "There will be upheaval while the academy building is redeveloped, meaning the Under-21s and Under-18s will use the modular building, a two-storey block behind the main building. The women's team used the same set-up during the £10m redevelopment of their facilities at Carrington.",
      "Read the full story here.",
      "Manchester United talent Shea Lacey has joined the England senior team for training at St George's Park ahead of Thursday's friendly against Wales at Wembley.",
      "The attacking midfielder was named in the Under 20s group for the first time, after an impressive start to the 2025/26 campaign with United.",
      "However, he was one of three players promoted into manager Thomas Tuchel's senior session, with Lakyle Samuel and Harrison Murray-Campbell the others linking up with the squad.",
      "Manchester United boss Ruben Amorim will already know his starting line-up for the trip to arch rivals Liverpool a week on Sunday.",
      "Injuries permitting, which is always the concern when players are released for international duty, Amorim knows the personnel he will deploy at Anfield as he seeks back-to-back league wins for the first time since taking charge nearly a year ago.",
      "United's 2-0 win over Sunderland has given Amorim the template to go to the home of the reigning champions and try to secure a first victory at Anfield since a Wayne Rooney strike secured a 1-0 win there back in 2016.",
      "Read the full story here.",
      "According to journalist Sacha Tavolieri, Manchester United midfielder Kobbie Mainoo is still attracting interest from Napoli and could make the move to the Serie A side in January.",
      "\"In advanced discussions with Manchester United at the very end of the summer transfer window, Napoli are maintaining contact with Kobbie Mainoo's entourage,\" Tavolieri said. \"What's more, the Partenopei are reportedly in pole position to land the promising English midfielder.",
      "\"A loan move is being considered as early as the January transfer window to give him more playing time and continue his development in a competitive environment. The Italian club hopes to conclude this deal quickly.\"",
      "Joshua Zirkzee's future has become the subject of speculation as a move away from Manchester United is reportedly on the cards.",
      "Reports have claimed that Zirkzee may consider an Old trafford exit when the January transfer window opens.",
      "Ruben Amorim's future at Manchester United has been the subject of speculation for several weeks, and now a fresh update has emerged.",
      "A report has claimed that United chiefs have held talks with members of the squad to determine if there is still support within the group for Amorim.",
      "Even though Marcus Rashford is enjoying life in Barcelona, the Manchester United star has seen his transfer value drop this season.",
      "Rashford left United to join Barca on loan for the season, and has already scored three goals and provided five assists at the Camp Nou.",
      "However, that form has not been enough to prevent Rashford's market value from falling this season.",
      "According to talkSPORT, Maguire is open to remaining at United beyond the end of his current contract which expires this summer.",
      "However, if he is to stay at Old Trafford, it is thought that he will need to accept a pay cut.",
      "Maguire has started just two Premier League matches this season - the win against Chelsea and the defeat over Brentford.",
      "One option United could look at to replace Zirkzee is Dusan Vlahovic.",
      "The Juventus man is being pushed out of Turin and is expected to leave no matter what next summer.",
      "United have been linked with him before but their hopes of signing him this time around could be slim as Bayern Munich are thought to be keen on the centre-forward and Vlahovic is believed to be open to the move.",
      "Napoli were keen on Zirkzee in the summer but signed Hojlund instead so they are likely to be out of the race this time around.",
      "The Mail understands Juventus and PSV Eindhoven hold an interest in Zirkzee and both would provide the Netherlands international with opportunities to play.",
      "However, the Reds would need to sign a replacement to allow Zirkzee to leave.",
      "That's according to the Daily Mail who claim that Zirkzee wants to leave United at the soonest opportunity.",
      "It is believed the forward is frustrated by his lack of minutes so far this season following the arrivals of Sesko, Cunha and Mbeumo.",
      "Zirkzee is keen to ensure a move is completed in January so as to boost his chances of making the World Cup squad.",
      "Hello and welcome back to the United transfer blog!",
      "My name is Jack Flintham and I shall be taking you through the latest United news in this opening few hours of the morning.",
      "To bring you up to speed, here's what you may have missed yesterday."

      "Kobbie Mainoo could get to Halloween without making a Premier League start this season.",
      "Mainoo will be spooked by his current situation. The youngster has knuckled down in an attempt to win back his starting role, but Ruben Amorim continues to overlook him on matchdays.",
      "There has been widespread chatter about Mainoo's predicament. The midfielder scored the matchwinner in the 2024 FA Cup final and started in the Euro 2024 final for England. But just 15 months later, he cannot get a start in the Premier League, so it's not a surprise that fans are talking about the situation.",
      "Mainoo is doing all he can to change Amorim's mind, training with a private coach during the international breaks and even changing his private chef at home in an attempt to improve.",
      "He deserves to be commended for reacting positively to the challenge that he is facing, although it will become increasingly difficult to stay motivated if his situation does not change.",
      "Will Mainoo's situation alter? It looks unlikely. He was an unused substitute for the opening two games of the season and has been limited to a further five substitute appearances since.",
      "Amorim has said Mainoo is competing with Bruno Fernandes for the deeper midfield role - but Fernandes is regarded as undroppable and has kept his place despite underperforming.",
      "There is still more water to go under the bridge before the January transfer window. Yet there is still a chance that Mainoo could force his way into the team and Amorim is praised for coaxing another level from him, however, the evidence from the first few months of the campaign suggest that it is unlikely.",
      "Instead, the indicators suggest Mainoo will ask to leave on loan for a second time when the winter window opens. Whether such a request would be accepted is another matter.",
      "Mainoo is under contract and was told to fight for his place by his manager when he enquired about leaving on loan in the summer, and United may give him a similar answer in January.",
      "The 20-year-old is desperate to play ahead of the World Cup - Mainoo is determined to make the England squad - but United will put the club first and argue he is needed in the dressing room.",
      "Amorim's midfield options are light and Mainoo will be needed if injuries occur, but there will naturally be frustration from the player's perspective, especially in a World Cup campaign.",
      "Fans will likely be sympathetic toward Mainoo, who is one of the biggest academy success stories of the last decade, and some believe he has been unfairly treated by Amorim so far this term.",
      "Amorim had a chance to start Mainoo against Brentford at the Gtech Community Stadium but preferred Manuel Ugarte, which was true to form after comments about Mainoo competing with Fernandes.",
      "United's head coach does not consider Mainoo as a foil to Fernandes, although that partnership hasn't been given a fair crack of the whip and appeals on paper in fixtures that United want to control.",
      "Amorim is as stubborn as old boots though and probably won't change his opinion on his midfield, which suggests Mainoo will revisit his situation in January with the hope of leaving for regular minutes.",
      "It will reflect badly on Amorim if he cannot make it work. There is something wrong with a manager's system if it cannot accommodate one of the finest young talents in Europe.",
      "Ten Hag described Mainoo as the \"perfect midfielder\". Gareth Southgate said England \"haven't really had a player like him until now\". United academy coaches were huge advocates of Mainoo's talent.",
      "Amorim is the first manager in Mainoo's career to question him, which is bound to be frustrating, but all he can do is continue to work hard and focus on his training at Carrington.",
      "It's fascinating because everyone knows what Mainoo can do, perhaps except Amorim.",

      "Manchester United have been told why Newcastle boss Eddie Howe is unlikely to replace Ruben Amorim in the event that a managerial change is made.",
      "Amorim's future as United head coach has been the subject of intense speculation in recent weeks, after a run of disappointing results in the first couple of months of the season. The Reds went into the international break on a positive note, though, with a 2-0 victory over Sunderland in the Premier League.",
      "Rumours about Amorim's future have led to speculation about a potential replacement being lined up, with several names reportedly being considered. Oliver Glasner of Crystal Palace, Fabian Hurzeler of Brighton and Andoni Iraola of Bournemouth have all been linked with the manager's job at Old Trafford in some capacity - while Howe has also been tipped a potential replacement.",
      "However, former Newcastle United midfielder Jeff Hendrick believes that United are likely to stick with Amorim for at least another transfer window. Hendrick also explained why he does not expect Howe to take the job if the opportunity arises.",
      "\"I would be so surprised if the Manchester United job came available and Eddie Howe took it. I think it's a really, really tough job to take now,\" said Hendrick in an interview with Boyle Sports.",
      "\"They're kind of stuck. You look at Ruben Amorim coming in, and he had a good profile of what he'd done previously, but he looks disheartened.",
      "\"He looks disheartened even though he's had a summer to get a couple of signings in. I think they're better off maybe sticking with him for another transfer window, but who knows if they will.",
      "\"Touching on Eddie Howe, he's got the run of the club at Newcastle now with how well he's done. He's able to bring in the players he wants, and let go of the players he doesn't want.",
      "\"The fans love him. I don't see why he'd leave. I think for him, his target is to consistently hit Champions League football with that club.\"",

      "Lacey has been in fine form for United's Under-21s this season, contributing two goals in four appearances, and has taken part in first-team training sessions at Carrington.",
      "The youngster has long been regarded as one of the brightest prospects for the future in United's academy. Liverpool-born Lacey was given a professional contract at 17 - the earliest age possible to sign a professional deal - and has been widely tipped to make a senior debut at Old Trafford.",
      "\"He is in the same sort of area as Chido because of time lost. Different to Chido, Chido is fast progression. Because of time lost with Shea, he still has lots to come tactically, physically and mentally.",
      "\"Everybody can see - you have to be blind not to see - the talent he's got. He's got lots to do in his game and he knows. We're still managing him physically because if he can stay on the pitch and can train every day, I think everyone thinks he could be a top, top player.\"",
      "United consider Lacey as a first-team prospect and they were protective of his minutes last season, wanting to ensure that the youngster did not suffer further small injury problems.",
      "Lacey has generated immense interest in the last few years because followers of the academy are excited about his potential.",
      "There have been comparisons made between Lacey and Phil Foden and, just like the Manchester City star, Lacey's long-term future could be as an attacking midfielder.",

      "David joined the MEN as Chief Manchester United Writer in September 2025.",
      "Senne Lammens was handed a gentle introduction to the Premier League with Manchester United's comfortable 2-0 win over Sunderland at the weekend.",
      "Lammens, an £18.2million deadline day signing from Royal Antwerp, looked assured and untroubled as he secured a clean sheet on his impressive United debut at Old Trafford.",
      "But the 23-year-old is set for the ultimate test after the international break when he walks out at Anfield a week on Sunday for the clash against United's fiercest rivals and champions, Liverpool.",
      "Nothing will have prepared Lammens for the venom and hostility that will come his way, with Liverpool fans ready to leave him in no doubt over the hatred they reserve for United players.",
      "That is why the cauldron of Anfield will be the true barometer of the young goalkeeper's temperament and mindset, playing under the most intolerable pressure and relentless intimidation.",
      "The Liverpool fans who will spend the whole game trying to put him off for the 90 minutes will hoping they succeed and that it is a case of 'Lammens to the Slaughter' by the end of the acrimonious encounter.",
      "That Lammens has impressed United's goalkeeping coach, Jorge Vital, and his staff will come as no surprise to anyone who witnessed his confident display against the newly-promoted Black Cats.",
      "Those who work closely with Lammens on a daily basis at United have been struck by how mature he is for his age, given his relative inexperience when it comes to playing at the highest level.",
      "“He's got a very calm personality and seems to be taking everything in his stride so far,” said a United source who sees Lammens at the training ground every day. “He's impressed a lot in training and everyone only has positive things to say about him.”",
      "Lammens credits his mother and father with his calm demeanour. “My parents are also really calm and collected,” he said. “From growing up, when I thought about the goalkeeper I wanted to become later in life, I think one of the best attributes you can have is staying calm under pressure, in any circumstances, even if you make a mistake. You just move on and try to give your best to the team.",
      "“If you want to be a good keeper, you have to be a rock behind the defence. They have to trust you and count on you in difficult moments. That is something I take pride in.”",
      "Off the pitch, Lammens -currently on international duty with Belgium - is as calm and settled as he is on it, having recently moved out of a Manchester hotel and into a house in the Cheshire enclave favoured by Premier League footballers, where he now resides with his girlfriend.",
      "He may have only been a United player for a little over a month, but Lammens has adapted to his new environment much quicker than many of United's recent new signings. He has enjoyed a meteoric rise, considering last season was his first full campaign as Antwerp's first-choice keeper, and he now finds himself occupying that role for one of the biggest clubs on the planet.",
      "That is testimony to his natural talent, strength of character and mental resilience, all of which will be tested to the limit at Anfield and the games to come if, as is surely the case, he keeps his place as United's No.1 ahead of Altay Bayindir.",

      "United fans celebrated the goalkeeper claiming a cross like they would react to a goal and he was congratulated by Matthijs de Ligt, Harry Maguire and Luke Shaw immediately after full-time.",
      "Ruben Amorim said of the 23-year-old: \"I think he looks confident in the first game, but the important thing is that the teammates help Senne to have a good game. Because everyone was focused, not a lot of mistakes, against a team that was really comfortable playing football.\"",
      "Explaining why Lammens' debut was delayed, Amorim added: “When Senne arrived here, first of all, Altay was playing, and then he arrives, and you can feel it, that he needs to adapt.",
      "\"New country, new training, the pressure that you guys put on the goalkeepers are massive. So, it was like a little preparation for the guy to be ready to start his first game.",
      "\"But now, it's just one game, and he needs to work because he needs to be prepared that in our club, things are really hard. But he did well, and again, he was comfortable during the game and that is a very good sign.\"",
      "Amorim said before the game that Lammens was starting due to rotation, but it would be a huge mistake to continue to rotate his goalkeepers after the Belgian's strong debut.",
      "Lammens provided calmness and leadership at the back, something Altay Bayindir has been unable to do, and removing him from the team would be a backward step.",
      "United signed Lammens for £182.million from Royal Antwerp on deadline day having considered Aston Villa's Emiliano Martinez, but club chiefs were understood to be convinced that Lammens was the best choice.",
      "The biggest argument to sign Martinez over Lammens was that he wouldn't need time to adapt to the Premier League. The remaining arguments in favour of the Argentine were not as compelling.",
      "United scraped a win against Burnley on the eve of deadline day, and Amorim said: \"We are in that moment. I think it is hard to be a Manchester United goalkeeper in this moment.\"",
      "However, Lammens made it look easy against Sunderland and will become cherished by supporters if he can reproduce that level of performance consistently in the coming weeks.",
      "Fans are desperate to watch a decent goalkeeper again. They wanted to believe that they were watching the second coming of Schmeichel against Sunderland last weekend.",
      "United have been represented by some world-class goalkeepers in history, but they have also made their fair share of bad goalkeeper signings. Onana, Massimo Taibi and Mark Bosnich are just some on that list.",
      "De Gea and Edwin van der Sar don't buy a drink when they return to Manchester and Lammens is hoping to have a similar impact after sparkling during his first appearance.",
      "Amorim has been patient with Lammens - resisting the urge to introduce him to prevent damage to his confidence - and it made sense to finally play him against Sunderland at Old Trafford.",
      "The fixture was a huge opportunity to keep a clean sheet. He obliged and is now primed to face a genuine test in Liverpool after the international break.",
      "“He’s been really good, looks really sharp – I’ve been really impressed with him and I’m really looking forward to playing with him,” said Luke Shaw about Lammens after his arrival.",
      "Tom Heaton said: “I didn’t know too much about him. It’s only been a few days’ training but he seems like a really good lad; calm but a strong personality. His goalkeeping fundamentals are very impressive.”",
      "Mason Mount was the latest dressing room member to praise Lammens when he spoke after Sunderland, saying: \"Senne coming in as well. It was a solid performance. Any danger of them pressing, he puts it into Ben (Sesko) and we work off that. I think he kind of released the pressure a lot today.\"",
      "You cannot blame United fans for getting carried away about Lammens' potential. And the £18.2m transfer fee could prove to be a bargain if he develops into the player United scouts believe he can become.",

      "Former Manchester United goalkeeper David De Gea has responded to fellow Spaniard Jordi Alba announcing his retirement. Earlier this week, the ex-Barcelona left-back confirmed his decision to stop playing professional football at the end of the current MLS season.",
      "Alba was part of an excellent Barcelona team that included Neymar, Luis Suarez and Lionel Messi with the 36-year-old still playing alongside the latter duo at Inter Miami. In his last outing before confirming such a big career decision, Alba scored twice in a 4-1 win over New England with Messi assisting one of those strikes.",
      "Despite still quite clearly being able to compete at a high level, Alba has taken the decision to retire later this month, as confirmed in a social media post.",
      "\"The time has come to close a truly meaningful chapter in my life,\" he said in a video posted on Instagram.",
      "\"I've decided to bring my professional football career to an end at the conclusion to this season. I do so with complete conviction, with peace, and with happiness.\"",
      "The comments on the post are filled with numerous big names sending well-wishes, though De Gea opted for a dedicated Instagram post to his former international team-mate.",
      "Alongside images of the two while representing Spain, he showed his true character with a classy message, writing: \"Jordi, Thanks for everything. You always gave 100% on and off the field, with that joy and good humor that characterizes you...\"Thank you for being so real, for your dedication and for your friendship. You are great on and off the field. I love you my friend [red heart emoji].\"",
      "De Gea has spent the last 14 months at Italian side Fiorentina and he has more than impressed, but it has been a very difficult start to the 2025/26 season. Fiorentina are yet to win in Serie A with their only victories coming in Conference League action.",
      "This past weekend's defeat to Roma prompted De Gea to send a message to supporters with Fiorentina only sat outside of the relegation zone on goal difference. Since his Old Trafford departure, the goalkeeper situation has been a very uncertain one at United.",
      "Andre Onana was brought in as his replacement from Inter, but he has struggled significantly with the decision made over the summer to ship him out on loan to Trabzonspor after Senne Lammens was signed from Royal Antwerp on deadline day.",
      "Altay Bayindir remained Ruben Amorim's No.1 for a few weeks but Lammens was brought in for his debut against Sunderland this past Saturday. The 23-year-old looked assured in between the sticks and he was able to help United keep their first clean sheet of the season.",

      "Manchester United head coach Ruben Amorim has been told that he should have looked to sign Crystal Palace centre-forward Jean-Philippe Mateta in the summer transfer window to strengthen their attack.",
      "The forward line was one of the main areas that Amorim pinpointed to improve at the start of the previous window. Wolverhampton Wanderers' Matheus Cunha, Brentford's Bryan Mbeumo and RB Leipzig's Benjamin Sesko were all signed to address this issue while Marcus Rashford, Antony, Jadon Sancho, Rasmus Hojlund and Alejandro Garnacho were all moved on either on loan or permanently.",
      "Depth in the centre-forward position is now somewhat limited. While both Cunha and Mbeumo can play there, they are often needed as No.10s while Joshua Zirkzee has been largely frozen out this season despite Amorim's reluctance to sell him in the summer.",
      "Speaking on his podcast, No Tippy Tappy Football, former Premier League manager Sam Allardyce insisted that United missed a trick not adding Mateta to their team. \"Man United should have bought him without a doubt,\" Allardyce explained.",
      "\"Arsenal could have bought him, you know what I mean? And he would have flourished.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "\"I mean, look at Crystal Palace. Crystal Palace are 18 games undefeated and he is one of the main reasons that they are where they are.",
      "\"Because it's not just his goal scoring ability, it's all round play. No bullying [Mateta].",
      "\"You can't bully him, he can bully you and is that because it's not fashionable for the top clubs now? They have to be more slick, more rubbish - get him in your team.",
      "\"Listen, a centre-forward who can batter a centre-half now, it would be such a shock to a centre-half now. They’d go: ‘What's happening? What's going on? What's he doing? What does he think he's doing, physically challenging me like that?’",
      "\"It's the all round ability and the skill and his goal scoring ability that’s absolutely totally and utterly essential and would have made Man United a much bigger and better team already this season and he'd have scored goals. And that's what they're struggling with still, as well as defensively.",
      "\"So I thought it was a big mistake because Crystal Palace would have had to sell somebody which they did. You know what I mean? Sold [Eberechi] Eze didn't they in the end?",
      "\"I mean they're always having to sell one you know to to balance the books. You [have to] go for Mateta. Just class.\"",
      "Mateta has been a consistent starter for Palace so far this season and has bagged four goals in all competitions already this season. This has included two in seven in the Premier League.",
      "The 28-year-old was fleetingly linked with United during the summer window but this interest was not formalised. Mateta will have just a singular year left on his contract at the end of this season.",

      "JJ Gabriel enjoys video games and comes out of his shell once he gets to know someone.",
      "In many ways he is a normal 14-year-old, but his extraordinary talent is revealed when he steps onto a football pitch. There is certainly nothing normal about what Gabriel can do with a ball at his feet.",
      "That is quite the prediction considering the graduates who have come before Gabriel, who already has more than 200,000 followers on Instagram and a sponsorship deal with Nike.",
      "Academy coaches who have worked with Gabriel have marvelled at the youngster's skillset and have struggled to find weaknesses, despite playing him years above his age group.",
      "Gabriel idolises Neymar and some of his goals are reminiscent of the Brazilian at the peak of his powers. Last weekend in an Under-18 game, Gabriel glided into the penalty area, deceived a Manchester City defender with a shimmy and found the corner. The clip has amassed thousands of views on social media.",
      "Word of Gabriel's talent has already swept around the world. Europe's top clubs have closely followed his development, and the teenager was close to leaving United in the summer.",
      "Talks were advanced with a European giant and an eleventh-hour meeting was held at Carrington in an attempt to keep Gabriel. It's understood Jason Wilcox (director of football) and Omar Berrada (CEO) were present, which shows the high regard in which Gabriel is held.",
      "United reiterated that Gabriel could become the face of the club and it was eventually agreed the teenage sensation would remain in Manchester - the player's final decision was decisive.",
      "There are windows for rivals to poach academy players at 14 and 16. Gabriel has committed his future at United for another two years at least, but interest from Europe's biggest sides will only intensify as he gets older, especially as he holds a European passport through his parents.",
      "United know they have a special talent on their hands and recently introduced Gabriel to Ruben Amorim. During their exchange, Amorim spent time discussing his philosophy and stressed the importance of working hard, even recalling an anecdote about Cristiano Ronaldo as an example.",
      "Amorim played alongside Ronaldo for Portugal's national team. The United boss recounted stories about Ronaldo's work ethic - he was the first to report for training and the last to leave.",
      "Gabriel does not lack a work ethic. He is already living like a dedicated professional athlete with his diet and recovery sessions, and wakes up at 6am most days to make his dream a reality.",
      "In the summer, he trained at a Nike camp in Marbella with Newcastle midfielder Sandro Tonali and former Liverpool striker Danny Ings. When Marcus Rashford joined Aston Villa on loan in January, Gabriel thanked him for taking penalties with him at Carrington before he left.",
      "He also received a \"get well soon\" video from Andre Onana when he was recovering from his shoulder injury last year. Experienced players are shocked when they learn his age.",
      "Gabriel has been offered a box at the new Old Trafford, which is planned to be completed by 2030, and was invited to watch the Premier League opener against Arsenal in the directors' box.",
      "It speaks volumes that brands are already desperate to work with Gabriel, who was subject to interest from Adidas before Nike beat off competition from the German company.",
      "Adidas were in pole position to sign Gabriel before a late effort from Nike to better their offer - how many 14-year-olds could spark a bidding war between sportswear's commercial giants?",
      "United want to temper expectations to help Gabriel focus on football. Former academy director Nick Cox was asked a question about Gabriel during an interview earlier this year and politely steered the conversation in another direction. Those questions will become common for his successor.",
      "Those who know Gabriel are not concerned about keeping him grounded. He has strong family support and a circle of friends, and those closest to him don't let him get ahead of himself. He is just JJ to them.",
      "Gabriel possesses the right mentality to enjoy a successful career. It takes him just minutes to forget about the football after leaving the pitch following an academy game at Carrington.",
      "That is a trait that many top professionals share - the ability to separate what happens on the pitch from their home lives - but Gabriel loves playing football and entertaining with the ball.",
      "Darren Fletcher was appointed as U18 manager in the summer, and a source praised Fletcher's handling of Gabriel this season because he wants him on the ball as much as possible.",
      "Gabriel has been played down the middle and from the left this term, although it doesn't matter which position he plays because the end result is the same: he tears through the opposition and scores.",
      "MUTV subscriptions might begin to sell like hot cakes, just so fans can watch Gabriel play.",
      "The teenager's ball control is exceptional, and his finishing power is remarkable for a player of his age. Gabriel has seven goals in six Under-18 appearances and scored for the Under-17s on Wednesday.",
      "He was even given the nickname 'Kid Messi' after clips of him training and completing skills went viral on social media when he was younger, and Lionel Messi would probably approve of his footwork.",
      "Fans have already started to speculate when Gabriel could make his senior debut, and it already feels likely that he will become United's youngest-ever Premier League player.",
      "Angel Gomes (16 years, 263 days), Shola Shoretire (17 years, 19 days) and Chido Obi (17 years, 79 days) are the youngest to make a debut for United in the Premier League.",
      "Gabriel has the potential to break that record, and he could even topple the Premier League record of Ethan Nwaneri (15 years, 181 days). Max Dowman (15 years, 235 days) is the second youngest.",
      "Mikel Arteta has shown faith in Nwaneri and Dowman at Arsenal, while talented Liverpool youngster Rio Ngumoha recently scored on his senior debut aged 16 years and 361 days.",
      "Dowman and Ngumoha have blown away spectators this season, offering an exciting glimpse into the future of English football, but many believe Gabriel could be the pick of the bunch.",
      "There is a reason why Wilcox and Berrada were involved in the meeting to keep Gabriel in the summer, and why the youngster has been offered a box at the new Old Trafford.",
      "He is a generational prospect - and the best is yet to come from the supremely talented teenager.",

      "Here is how United's players rated this afternoon:",
      "Senne Lammens",
      "An assured United debut from the deadline day signing. Confident coming for the ball and made a fine save from Granit Xhaka and one near the end. Will be hard to dislodge him. 8",
      "Leny Yoro",
      "Disciplined in his defending and deserving of his recall to the starting line-up after being benched for the previous two games . Brings better balance to United's back three. 7",
      "Matthijs de Ligt",
      "Alert to danger throughout and never caught out of position defending his goal. Played a key role in United's second goal, challenging for the flick-on that ultimately led to it. 7",
      "Luke Shaw",
      "Kept his place on the left side of United's back three, but moved inside to a more central position at times after the break, giving United greater control on the ball. 7",
      "Amad",
      "A constant threat down the right side. Tormented Sunderland's defence and unlucky not to score in the first-half when he cut inside and saw a goal-bound effort saved. 7",
      "Casemiro",
      "Back in the starting line-up following his one-match ban, he was disciplined in midfield, although he picked up an obligatory booking late on for a poor challenge. 7",
      "Bruno Fernandes",
      "Another ebullient performance from the United skipper, who was seemingly everywhere, covering so much ground. Had an exquisite chip tipped onto the bar by Robin Roefs. 7",
      "Diogo Dalot",
      "Kept his place following the Brentford debacle and it was from his long throw-in that Sesko was able to plunder United's second goal. Impressive energy levels. 7",
      "Bryan Mbeumo",
      "Provided the assist for Mount's opener and never gave the Sunderland defence any peace with his runs in behind and ability to pick up dangerous positions. 7",
      "Benjamin Sesko",
      "Scored for the second game running with a classic poacher's goal from close-range in the first-half. United exploited his aerial threat throughout to win second balls. 7",
      "Mason Mount",
      "Restored to the starting line-up and justified his selection by setting United on their way to victory with a superbly-taken goal. Standing ovation when taken off. 8",
      "Subs:",
      "Dorgu (Dalot, 64)",
      "Solid at left wing-back. 6",
      "Cunha (Mount, 64)",
      "Lively attacking threat. 6",
      "Mainoo (Mbeumo, 76)",
      "Not enough time to impact the game. 6",
      "Ugarte (Casemiro, 85)",
      "A late arrival. N/A",

      "PGMO chief Howard Webb has reportedly admitted to Manchester United that Brentford defender Nathan Collins should have been sent off in their defeat on September 27.",
      "With United trailing 2-1 after an Igor Thiago brace which was pegged back by Benjamin Sesko, the Reds won a penalty after Collins tugged back Bryan Mbeumo inside the penalty area. The spot kick was rightly awarded but the punishment for Collins by referee Craig Pawson was merely a booking.",
      "Had Collins made a genuine attempt to play the ball, a booking would have sufficed in this scenario thanks to the recently introduced 'double jeopardy' rule. However, it seemed clear at the time that Collins did not make a genuine attempt and he was the last man, thus preventing Mbeumo having a goalscoring opportunity.",
      "The decision not to send off Collins would feel even more bitter when Bruno Fernandes missed his penalty and Mathias Jensen scored late to win the game 3-1. According to the Daily Mail, United chiefs Omar Berrada and Jason Wilcox sought clarification on the decision with Webb who admitted the mistake.",
      "It is claimed that United did not want to make a 'public fuss' about the situation and appreciated Webb's rational explanation for why the mistake was made. Of course, had Collins been sent off the context of the game could have been a lot different with United having roughly 20 minutes against ten men to seek an equaliser.",
      "What's more, the defeat caused significant pressure to mount on Ruben Amorim which may not have been the case had the match finished differently. MEN Sport understands that United are not currently considering sacking their Portuguese head coach.",
      "Despite reports stating that Gareth Southgate is among the names that Ineos are considering replacing Amorim with, there are believed to have been no contacts made with other managers regarding the currently filled position at Old Trafford. Fortunately for United, they put the defeat to Brentford behind them on Saturday with a 2-0 victory over Sunderland.",

      "Goalkeeper Senne Lammens began his Manchester United career with a win and a clean sheet, and the Belgian international received plenty of credit from his home country's media. Lammens joined United from Royal Antwerp on transfer deadline day but has needed to wait patiently for his debut while Ruben Amorim continued to keep faith with Altay Bayindir.",
      "The new keeper's opportunity arrived at last on Saturday, with Amorim handing him a start against Sunderland. All went according to plan for the 23-year-old, with goals from Mason Mount and Benjamin Sesko ensuring United got three points and eased the pressure on their head coach.",
      "United's win was a timely one for Amorim, with some suggestions his job could be at risk if his team lost. After the victory, he spoke highly of Lammens while also praising the team as a whole.",
      "\"We didn’t play well all the game, but we had our moments and we defended well,\" Amorim said. \"I think Senne did a great job and gave us confidence. It was a good day, not a perfect day, but to win like this with a clean sheet is important for our team.",
      "\"We need to understand that we need everyone to be ready to play. It's a long season, we have a lot of problems, anything can happen. The important thing is that the teammates helped Lammens a lot to have a very good performance.\"",
      "While Lammens will surely face trickier tests than Sunderland this season, perhaps starting with his next game, he still earned plaudits from the Belgian press.",
      "\"Against Sunderland, the scenario was perfect for Lammens,\" Sporza's verdict began. \"He was barely challenged in the first half and took no risks in possession. It was striking how he constantly connected with his backline and made adjustments.",
      "\"Sober, precise, and controlling. Old Trafford appreciated this and gave Lammens plenty of opportunities at times.\"",
      "The same publication pointed to his sharp save from a long-range Granit Xhaka effort, as well as the let-off he received when Bertrand Traore was booked for diving after it looked for a moment as though Lammens had conceded a penalty.",
      "\"If Ruben Amorim still had any doubts about who would be the first choice goalkeeper, Lammens has more than left his mark today,\" Sporza added.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "Elsewhere in Belgium, HLN highlighted Amorim's praise for Lammens while pointing out the goalkeeper watched much of the first half 'from a distance'. They wrote: \"Just over a month after his arrival and after three matches on the bench, Lammens finally made his debut for Manchester United.",
      "\"The goalkeeper thus became the seventh Belgian to feature for the Red Devils. Marouane Fellaini, Romelu Lukaku, Adnan Januzaj, Ritchie De Laet, Marnick Vermijl, and Largie Ramazani preceded him.",
      "\"Lammens had to prove himself once in the first half. The former Antwerp goalkeeper made a good save on a powerful shot from Xhaka. His play on the ball at his feet and on high balls was also flawless. From a distance, our compatriot saw Manchester United dominate.\"",
      "The report added that his next assignment could be considerably trickier. \"All in all, Lammens can look back with satisfaction on his debut in the Manchester United shirt,\" it read. \"His first clean sheet is a fact. This debut will leave him wanting more. His next assignment? The top-flight match at Anfield against Liverpool on Sunday, October 19th. Lammens will likely be tested more then.\"",
      "Nieuwsblad's Brian Dewulf referenced United fans' response to the impressive debut. \"Just before half-time, Senne Lammens finally got the chance to show his true colours,\" he wrote. \"Granit Xhaka had the first attempt for Sunderland, but Lammens saw the long-range shot come from far out and made a good save. There was applause in Old Trafford.",
      "\"The Belgian goalkeeper remained virtually unemployed in the second half, though it was a bit of a shock after an hour of play. Bruno Fernandes gave his keeper the runaround with a long ball, causing the pair to collide. Sunderland winger Traoré lurked and nearly capitalised, but also went down in the action.",
      "\"Ultimately, Man United were given the foul, allowing Lammens and his teammates to breathe a sigh of relief. He was applauded again in the final seconds for his second save of the evening, but Lammens was never given another opportunity.",
      "\"It was certainly a successful debut for the Belgian goalkeeper. Manchester United secured only their third Premier League victory, and the young Belgian also secured their first clean sheet of the season for the Mancunians.",
      "\"Has the train departed? During the match, the home fans were already singing loudly for the goalkeeper: \"Are you Schmeichel in disguise?\" fans wondered aloud if Lammens wasn't just the former Danish legend of Man U.\"",

      "Marcus Rashford continued his impressive start to life at Barcelona as he netted a stunning volley against Sevilla.",
      "The England international celebrated his latest call-up by Thomas Tuchel by getting on the scoresheet for the Catalan giants.",
      "Pedri delivered the perfect ball after Barca had hounded their opponents high up the pitch, and Rashford timed his run from the left with precision before firing it past Odysseas Vlachodimos, on loan from Newcastle, with his left foot.",
      "The goal marked the seventh consecutive match in which Rashford has made a goal contribution, and he now has three goals and five assists in 10 appearances since making his loan move from Manchester United.",
      "Rashford has more contributions than United stars Bryan Mbeumo, Bruno Fernandes and Benjamin Sesko combined.",
      "The 27-year-old's efforts on Sunday were in vain, however, as Barcelona crashed to a 4-1 defeat.",
      "Former United star Alexis Sanchez opened the scoring from the penalty spot before Isaac Romero doubled the home side's lead. Rashford's impressive strike then came in first-half injury time.",
      "Late goals from Jose Angel Carmona and Akor Adams ensured a big upset, however, as Sevilla claimed three points.",
      "Barca boss Hansi Flick said: \"The first half was not good for us, they played one against one and very aggressive.",
      "\"We had no solutions, that's not a good thing. But in the second half I really appreciate the team's reaction.",
      "\"I don't want to talk about the two goals, we don't want excuses. We have to focus on the first half, but the most important thing is the reaction. This defeat is important and after the break we will fight for all the titles. That's what we want, we are a good team.\"",

      "Benjamin Sesko made it 2-0 shortly after the half hour mark as he grabbed his second goal in a week.",

      "Here’s all the reaction from today’s game:",
      "Ruben Amorim's Manchester United players delivered for their boss to spare him another uneasy inquest and potentially the sack.",
      "Amorim admitted ahead of the game that it would be impossible for him to carry on if results did not improve – with this game billed as make-or-break for the embattled United boss.",
      "Amorim will hope he can now head into the international break without worrying about getting a call from chief executive Omar Berrada thanking him for his time in charge.",
      "Amorim needed this victory to ease the growing pressure on him, amid suggestions of players losing faith in his methods and United's hierarchy starting to harbour doubts about him.",
      "United remain a work in progress and have yet to win back-to-back league games under Amorim, but this win – albeit against a meek Sunderland side – has brought the head coach more time.",
      "Read the full report here.",
      "Matthijs de Ligt",

      "Luke Shaw",

      "Amad",

      "All the talk was about Amorim's future after Brentford and this has been a great response.",
      "Amorim is wearing a full tracksuit on the touchline today and Dalot's long throw-in created the chance for Sesko to score. Tony Pulis would be proud of this proper Barclays football.",
      "Sesko makes it 2-0, reacting quickest to the loose ball following a throw-in from Dalot, which was flicked on by Sunderland’s Nordi Mukiele. Sekso showed quick reactions to turn the ball in from close range.",

      "But United need to turn their dominance into the hard currency of a second goal to give themselves some breathing space in terms of the scoreline.",
      "Amorim cannot believe United haven't extended their advantage. Roefs did brilliantly to deny Fernandes' effort and Amad headed the follow up wide of the post.",

      "If you are asking in recent times, too often to count. Each new addition has been brought in with the promise of being able to change United's fortunes around.",
      "Memphis Depay, Alexis Sanchez, Rasmus Hojlund were all signed to be the new main man at Old Trafford and have failed to live up to the hype. Benjamin Sesko received the same adulation when he signed for United and there was fears that the Slovenian was going to struggle with the weight of expectation.",
      "In his opening five Premier League matches he drew blanks. And while some questioned whether he was receiving adequate support from his teammates, there was a fear that Sesko was going to follow the same path as those who came before him.",
      "However, his first goal for the club at Brentford has swiftly been followed by his second against Sunderland. Now, there is a feeling of momentum behind the centre-forward and genuine hope that he can deliver where so few have.",
      "And yet, Sesko's admission following the victory over the Black Cats should leave the supporters excited to see what he can do moving forward. \"No, not yet,\" he responded to MUTV when asked if we were starting to see the best of him at United.",
      "\"There is loads [still] to come, definitely. I’m still getting used to it more and more, to read the players, to connect with them even more.",
      "\"I believe I can be even better and I will try to show it.\" This admission should excite fans as few can argue that Sesko, when given the opportunity, hasn't looked like an improvement on last season's options at centre-forward.",
      "If there is more to come from Sesko, United fans have every right to feel optimistic. A more consistent goal threat will be just the tonic for Ruben Amorim as he looks to change the Reds' fortunes.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Casemiro made a beeline for Ruud van Nistelrooy in the Old Trafford tunnel on his return with Leicester City in February.",
      "Van Nistelrooy, a fluent Spanish speaker, was the conduit between Casemiro and Erik ten Hag after his Portuguese-speaking assistant Mitchell van der Gaag left. Van Nistelrooy started Casemiro in all four of his matches as caretaker manager. Casemiro lingered as Van Nistelrooy spoke, as attached to him as a comfort blanket.",
      "At that time, Casemiro had not started for United in 39 days. He did not get a kick between December 30, the night of the Newcastle United debacle, and January 30. He emerged on 70 minutes in Bucharest with United 2-0 up. The transfer window was still open but the chances of United shifting Casemiro were, like the Trinity test igniting the atmosphere, near zero.",
      "People at United's Carrington training complex noticed Casemiro's personality never wavered during a trying first half of the season. They have always found him to be a warm presence.",
      "His transformation at United in the past two months has been as unexpected as their 3-0 triumph in Bilbao. This is the midfielder who was dropped for last year's FA Cup final and replaced by Toby Collyer with United 2-0 down to Liverpool at half-time eight months ago. Casemiro’s declaration that he was keen to see out his contract in March was framed as more bad news for the club.",
      "Casemiro used his head before Athletic lost theirs in San Mames. Returning to Spain emboldens Casemiro. In San Sebastián and Bilbao, he has reminded Spanish audiences he can still cut it nearly three years on from leaving their shores. United supporters serenaded Casemiro on Thursday night.",
      "The draw with Real Sociedad in mid-March has marked a late turning point in Casemiro's third season in Manchester. With Manuel Ugarte out injured, Ruben Amorim had little choice but to turn to the older defensive midfielder.",
      "Casemiro has since been a fixture in the United starting XI, his importance highlighted by the early withdrawal at Bournemouth last week to preserve him for Bilbao. Ugarte admitted this week he is copying him.",
      "Within a matter of months, Casemiro has gone from unsellable to undroppable. If or when United reach the Europa League final, Casemiro is a shoo-in in midfield. The 3-4-2-1 system Amorim swears by has closed the yawning gaps that developed between the defence and midfield under Ten Hag and Casemiro has the safety net of a third centre back.",
      "United have adjusted Casemiro’s running and pressing triggers. “I think he has improved a lot also,” Amorim opined. “You can see not the way he plays but the way he runs. You can see it, we have the data to show him where he worked really hard.",
      "“He is a very good example. Even Toby sometimes was playing in front of him and [that] it is hard to take for Casemiro. So it is a lesson for all the players in Manchester United.",
      "“No matter what is the past or the last month, everything can change in one moment. Then we understood that he cannot jump all the time pressing high. We need to let him understand and sometimes it is better to put three defenders and let him be the fourth defender and put the wing-backs pressing high. These are all things we are understanding and trying to cope with all the criticisms of the team. But the credit is for Casemiro.”",
      "Amorim has been impressed by how hard Casemiro has worked to meet his demands to regain his place in the team. He noticed that he never complained during those winter weeks warming the bench.",
      "Selflessness is a natural trait of Casemiro's. It was also his undoing this time last year. With United depleted at centre half, he dropped back and was humiliated in the 4-0 drubbing by Crystal Palace.",
      "With Kobbie Mainoo and Christian Eriksen a flimsy shield and Jonny Evans his creaking partner, Casemiro abandoned his position to engage Michael Olise, overcommitted, lost his balance and Olise scored. Six days later, he trundled out of the United third and played Arsenal winger Gabriel Martinelli onside to square for Leandro Trossard’s tap-in. Sofyan Amrabat was ushered back in from the cold and played his way into the FA Cup final XI.",
      "Jamie Carragher urged Casemiro to “leave the football before the football leaves you”. Casemiro had been pencilled in to flank Amorim for pre-match press duties against Athletic and he would be a worthy choice at Carrington next week. He is a positive story again and one of the squad’s figureheads. United view Casemiro as a quiet leader, mind.",
      "The 33-year-old shared Raphael Varane’s view that a “disconnect” had developed between the players and Ten Hag. It is not a coincidence that Casemiro scored two goals in the first game after Ten Hag was finally sacked. He was committed enough to claim the last goal of the Ten Hag era at West Ham.",
      "When Casemiro discussed the possibility of joining United, he wanted to know three things: where he would live, where he would train and where the stadium was. During FaceTime conversations, he requested to see the club’s gymnasium at Carrington.",
      "United sources have been struck by how leaner Casemiro is this season. People in Madrid said Casemiro used to be in the club's Valdebebas gym at 8am and he often has gym sessions before and after training at Carrington.",
      "Casemiro has struck up a close rapport with some of the masseurs and his English is now a very good level of conversational. He understood our questions in the mixed zone two years ago, when his handshake grip was as tight as a vice. Casemiro's wife, Anna, and children Sara and Caio, are happy in Manchester amid the prospect of a fourth year in England's north west.",
      "Staff at Carrington regard Casemiro as one of the most respectful players they have encountered and that he is strident in protecting the club's image. Sir Jim Ratcliffe dubbed Casemiro as \"overpaid\" and \"not good enough\" in March. Three days later, Casemiro trumped his first-leg performance against Sociedad in the 4-1 win at Old Trafford.",
      "His steep decline over 18 months - dropped for Amrabat, substituted for Collyer, omitted from the Brazil squad - makes Casemiro’s revival so singular. If United win the Europa League it would be churlish to argue someone who has won three trophies in three seasons has been an unsuccessful signing.",
      "Casemiro drove United to a successful 2022-23 season. Without him, they would not have qualified for the Champions League. Ten Hag dubbed him the “cement between the stones”, essentially the glue in the team. Casemiro was central to the Latino rebranding of the United defence that kept the most clean sheets in the Premier League.",
      "Casemiro has returned to that level of influence he wielded in his first season. In Europe, at least. The concern if United do not triumph in Bilbao again this month is Casemiro could be redundant in a campaign devoid of Champions League midweeks. His recent domestic form has been inoffensive but not stellar and United need a young and dynamic new central midfielder in the summer.",
      "The senior figures made the difference in Bilbao, though. Casemiro and Bruno Fernandes, two 30-something Portuguese speakers, are naturally close.",
      "“We've got a lot of senior players who need to step up in their moments,” Harry Maguire explained. “I think Case was brilliant tonight. Bruno as well. So we have senior players who need to handle these moments really well.”",
      "Van Nistelrooy, a champion of Casemiro’s, merits credit for that.",

      "Ruben Amorim has barely survived one international break but could fall into the trap of another, with Sir Jim Ratcliffe minded to follow Daniel Levy.",
      "The conventional wisdom is that international breaks spell bad news for under-pressure managers. If the trigger fingers of Premier League executives only become itchier the longer they are given to contemplate such decisions, that week or so when players are sent around the world to represent their countries can be the most dangerous time for struggling coaches. It used to give Steve Bruce sleepless nights.",
      "That vibe feels particularly relevant for Ange Postecoglou and Ruben Amorim at Nottingham Forest and Manchester United, while Vitor Pereira might not be too eager to check his work emails before Wolves reconvene.",
      "But are international breaks really that perilous for a Premier League manager? And what is it about them which makes chairmen desperate to get hold of a particular Italian’s number? Sir Jim Ratcliffe might try and drag Claudio Ranieri out of retirement soon.",
      "",
      "“We are going to speak because there are things to address,” said Nuno Espirito Santo of a “shocking” performance against West Ham which “didn’t help things” when it came to his upcoming showdown talks with owner Evangelos Marinakis.",
      "There has since been a suggestion those talks never even took place, that Marinakis was so incensed with Nuno going public on the breakdown of their relationship and issues with new Global Head of Football Edu that the irascible Greek had made his mind up regardless.",
      "How well has it gone? Well Nuno soon found employment at West Ham and his replacement, Ange Postecoglou, is the favourite in the Premier League sack race after starting with seven winless games. So not very well.",
      "",
      "The only surprise was that it took so long. Conte spent his final press conference as Spurs manager systematically dismantling any bridges back to north London and indeed very possibly the Premier League itself to such an extent that Daniel Levy needed a week to properly digest the tongue-lashing.",
      "The chairman eventually responded with a 111-word statement pretending the Italian’s exit was in any way ‘mutual’, delivered an hour or so after England dispatched Ukraine in Euro 2024 qualifying with an opening goal from Harry Kane.",
      "The Spurs striker had quite inevitably scored in the draw with Southampton which triggered Conte’s last, exit-inducing outburst, the captain being rendered collateral damage like everyone else.",
      "It did not exactly come out of nowhere. Conte, as is his eternal legal obligation, had been growing increasingly tetchy over previous weeks. Spurs remained in a theoretical race for Champions League qualification but they limped out of the same competition to AC Milan in the last 16 and were knocked out of the FA Cup by Championship side Sheffield United in the build-up to the Southampton game.",
      "They led 3-1 at St Mary’s by the 76th minute but drew after a stunning collapse culminated in James Ward-Prowse scoring a stoppage-time penalty. Their form was disastrous, the relationship was broken and the international break offered a chance to reset.",
      "It also provided an opportunity to appoint Conte’s assistant as his replacement; Cristian Stellini lasted four games as interim manager before himself being shown the door following a 6-1 defeat at Newcastle. But at least he managed to leave without offering every past, present and future club employee outside.",
      "READ NEXT: The best bits of the inside stories about Conte leaving Spurs, from bored players to an angry academy",
      "",
      "In the antepenultimate post of a glittering managerial career, Ranieri’s 16-week, 14-game reign at Vicarage Road was an all-timer for ridiculousness.",
      "They failed to keep a clean sheet and conceded four goals or more in four games. The Italian’s first match against Liverpool was very possibly the single worst team performance ever committed to Premier League history. His last game was a 3-0 defeat to Norwich.",
      "But his two wins were remarkable: 5-2 against Everton and 4-1 against Man Utd to maintain at least mathematical hope of a survival which was never realistically going to be achieved.",
      "Ranieri was, at the very least, more popular than his successor – and possibly even his predecessor.",
      "",
      "Not 24 hours after a 1-0 defeat to Leeds described by goalkeeper and captain Ben Foster as “a battering”, Watford dispensed with Munoz 10 months into his reign after sensing “a negative trend at a time when team cohesion should be visibly improving”.",
      "The Hornets were 14th with seven points from as many games, having beaten Aston Villa; how many managers would they would sack to return to such “a negative trend” four years later?",
      "More. The answer is always more.",
      "Munoz’s longest coaching stint ever remains the 41 games he managed with Slovakian top-flight side Dunajska Streda, with spells at Huesca, Anorthosis, Sheffield Wednesday and ohor Darul Ta’zim hardly suggesting Watford made a glaring error in parting with the manager who had secured automatic promotion so recently.",
      "Ranieri was soon installed, himself only lasting until January before handing over to Roy Hodgson, who barely muddled through until May as Watford suffered a Premier League relegation from which they are yet to recover.",
      "",
      "One of the precious few Premier League managers to be sacked after winning their final game, Farke’s fate was sealed long before Norwich earned their first victory of the season 11 games in. A matter of minutes after conducting post-match media duties having beaten Brentford, the Canaries told the manager that he would be left in the coalmine.",
      "The decision to part with Farke had apparently been made on the morning of the game, regardless of the result. Norwich were bottom after a run of two draws, three goals scored and eight defeats in their first ten matches; they remained rooted to the foot of the table even after the Brentford win.",
      "But the timing was curious. While the international break was an in-built momentum killer anyway, Norwich seemed desperate to crush even the pretence of an hour’s worth of overdue positivity.",
      "It took them another nine days to unsuccessfully pursue Frank Lampard and bring in Dean Smith, who won his first game but only three of the subsequent 26 as Norwich finished precisely where they were when Farke was forced out.",
      "",
      "Norwich’s delay can be explained at least in part by the fact the manager they eventually settled on was busy himself being sacked in the interim.",
      "Smith was regrettably shown the Aston Villa door after five consecutive defeats, the last of which came against Southampton. He remains the only manager to face the same opponent in consecutive Premier League games in the same season, but with different clubs; Norwich beat Saints a fortnight later and Smith went on to force three separate sackings later in the campaign.",
      "It was an undoubted gamble on Villa’s part and many felt Smith had been dealt with harshly, particularly considering Jack Grealish had been sold the summer before. But it seemed as though they nailed the call when Steven Gerrard was brought in from Rangers and immediately oversaw an improvement in results and performances.",
      "Those wheels soon came off and Gerrard did not last a year. In all fairness to Villa, they did alright with their next appointment.",
      "",

      "Manchester United legend Gary Neville has made a lot of middle-aged white men angry by making a fair point about division in the UK and beyond.",
      "Neville has come in for a lot of stick over the last week with the Daily Mail’s reporting of his comments particularly concerning as they described them as a ‘racist’ outburst.",
      "Despite the former Man Utd and England defender making a wider point condemning “hate speech in any form and abuse in any form” and urging everyone to unite “to get back to a country of love, of peace, of harmony”, they have predictably been dragged out of context in certain quarters.",
      "Here we have put together nine of the best, worst, and honestly most terrifying views on Neville’s comments this week…",
      "",
      "“In his, obviously, isolated world he lives in, he’s in the kind of ivory tower position of being shuttled into a Sky studio, back behind a wall in whatever sprawling estate he’s got, they’re saying he’s worth between £50m and £70m. People are telling me that Overlap earns all them £20,000 a pop, they’re sponsored by ARNE now so surely ARNE’s going to be delighted with Gary saying that because I would imagine their target audience is white, middle-class men. It’s definitely not fella’s called Jihad, white, middle-class men called Jihad. I can’t imagine there being that many of them around.",
      "“But Gary’s got himself into this virtue signalling nonsense. We have this pillock, Neville, and he’s crossed over with me because as I said to him and Rio last night, I’m more than welcome to debate both of you. Let’s roll for two hours, discuss any topic. Gary sat in a room with me when we did The Edge podcast, you don’t need to be scared of me, but intellectually I think you’ve got a lot to answer for here.",
      "“I don’t think Gary Neville has thought about who are his audience. Because I’m looking at it going, you’ve just said people who like the Union Jack, people who are patriotic to show their country’s flag in, in this instance, the country he’s from and represented 85 times at international level…just factor in if he said somebody with brown skin or somebody with black skin, there’d be an absolute outrage about it.”",
      "The delightful Barton added: “People like this, gaslighting you all the time, saying to you: ‘no, no you’re a racist for thinking that. You’re far right for thinking that.’ There’s a synagogue attacked and we get a f*****g d***head footballer, absolute idiot, whose ar**hole is for rent to the highest bidder.",
      "“If that’s the Qataris, he’ll forget anything to do with human rights to go and take the Qatari money. He is a whore who is open for exploitation as he has shown this weekend with his stupid comments.",
      "“Now, if he was a man of the people, like he says he was, and if he was really in touch with his fanbase or the people that support his shows or his football club or some of his businesses, then he would know middle-aged white men in this country aren’t the problem.",
      "“Sticking a few flags up and being petrified that your daughters or your granddaughters or your wife are going to be accosted in a changing room by an illegal invader is not a f*****g far right position.”",
      "READ: Neville a ‘traitor’ and Postecoglou sack imminent to bafflement of Daily Mail",
      "",
      "“I think it’s astonishing in the wake of an Islamist terror attack that he decides to have a go at middle-aged white men.",
      "“Maybe the middle-aged white men are the ones who worked on minimum wage inside his hotel, I don’t know. I think he’s a champagne socialist and a coward. It’s a dreadful thing to have said.”",
      "Pushed on why Neville is a coward, Jordan went on: “I think the real issue is about radical Islamist extremism and he doesn’t have the balls to call it out for what it is, rather than suggest that challenging our country about what’s happening, he’s insulated from these things.",
      "“He lives in a very rarefied world where his money and privilege has allowed him to live in a gated environment, not have to worry about NHS appointments, doesn’t have to worry about people being attacked in the streets by immigrants that shouldn’t be here in the first place.",
      "“He doesn’t have to worry about these things, so he has the ability to sit there and observe in such a way that insulates himself from it. I think it’s an appalling stance to have taken.",
      "“He’s entitled to his view, he’s entitled to a view. We are quite happy to wave any other flag in this country, whether it’s Palestinian flags, Ukraine flags or any other flag that we feel we’re able to wave.",
      "“But when you’re talking about people in this country that have legitimate concerns and want to have a legitimate value set and push back against what they’re having forced upon them, for Gary Neville to say what he said is the exact embodiment of being a champagne socialist, insulated from the real world and a coward because the real issue is some of the extremism going on in this country.”",
      "",
      "Le Tissier told students at Southampton Solent University: “He’s basically attacked the demographic of people that are paying his wages, which is a bit strange.",
      "“I think it depends on what side of the argument you fall on and whether your side of the argument suits the agenda of the current media.",
      "“Which I think, you know, for the large part is very left leaning, so if you’re slightly right leaning you won’t be given the good graces to make mistakes other people will be given.”",
      "The Southampton legend added: “Yeah, I think they’ll stand by him and support him, yeah",
      "“I mean, they stood by Jamie Carragher when he spat at a young girl out of the back of his car.",
      "“It is not quite as bad as that, so I think Gary’s got a pretty fair argument there if they try and get rid of him.”",
      "",
      "“He’s blaming them for all the division, not some evil, crazed, mad Islamist who went out to kill innocent people.”",
      "Farage added: “I will tell you what, this Gary Neville is so detached from reality, so detached from the average football fan, it is not true.",
      "",
      "“I’m sorry — I know I tell you every week I’m gonna come here and I’m gonna be calm. We’re being told that we’re being turned against each other mainly by angry middle-aged white men who deem it OK to put up flags.",
      "“I’m not gonna sit here and say stick to football, everybody’s entitled to their opinion, but why am I surrounded by people like Neville who have made millions on the back of working-class people — people they’re supposed to represent, people they’re supposed to respect?”",
      "Kyle added: “Does he actually believe that middle-aged white men raising flags is causing division in this country?",
      "“Three hours after those poor, poor Jewish people on Yom Kippur were murdered by that terrorist called Jihad… a protest march not three hours later, not a mile away, with people waving Palestinian flags and shouting obscenities — but Gary Neville wouldn’t mention that, would he?",
      "“But if you stood up and said it’s disgraceful that these people are marching and inciting violence, people like Neville would say, ‘Oh but it’s unfair.’ But it’s alright to attack middle-aged white men.”",
      "Kyle continued: “I tell you what Gary Neville, do two things: take your fortune and give it to every immigrant and every group that you think isn’t treated well in this country — do that, but you won’t, will you?",
      "“Or go and live somewhere, you numpty, where there are immigrants on the streets and where your teenage daughters might not feel safe, rather than behind the gates of your massive mansion in Chester.”",
      "",
      "‘We need to check ourselves, start to bring ourselves back to a neutral point,” he says, playing the great healer. After all, nothing says neutrality quite like blaming the toxicity exclusively on “angry middle-aged white men”.",
      "‘Neville is the classic case of a celebrity so feted within his own sport that he appears oblivious to anything or anybody who might challenge his world view. Gary Lineker fell into the same trap…",
      "‘Neville is discovering the hard way that views that resonate inside his self-congratulatory pundit bubble often collapse on first contact with reality. Hence why his latest video has provoked less applause than derision and contempt, with increasing threats from viewers to stop paying for Sky in protest. Perhaps now he realises that if you are going to posture as the voice of balance and reason, you cannot savage the flying of the Union Flag as divisive and then fail even to mention the Palestine Action protests that took place directly after the Manchester outrage, in defiance of calls to show respect to the Jewish community.",
      "‘It is doubly bizarre that Neville invokes his patriotism with the old “I’ve played 85 times for my country” line. These honours, earned from 1995 to 2007, were achieved purely on the strength of his sporting talent, not because of his undying devotion to Queen and country. So why does he now feel an entitlement to define patriotic allegiance for everyone else? The answer, quite simply, is hubris. Neville acts as if his position as the country’s most prominent football analyst also confers the right to be its conscience.",
      "‘His response to the atrocity in his home city might be his most dangerous lapse into self-parody yet. The problem is not just the hopelessly mangled logic, with Neville drawing a line from the act of an Islamist terrorist to enthusiasm for the Union Flag, but that he is biting the hand that feeds. Why is he belittling his own audience? Why does he not pause to consider that he has strayed so far out of his lane that he is practically in the ditch? The problem, hardly for the first time, is not angry middle-aged white men, but multimillionaires called Gary deluded into presuming that their football credentials give them a monopoly on moral virtue.’",
      "",
      "‘THERE was a time, presumably, when Gary Neville wasn’t quite so offended by the sight of our national flags as he now appears to be.",
      "‘When he was playing his 85 games for England I don’t remember him storming up into the stands to rip down St George’s Crosses or Union Jacks waved by enthusiastic fans, nor objecting to men, women and children who joined in the fun by painting red crosses on their faces.’",
      "Clark added: ‘In a video he posted online he boasted of how he had ordered a Union Flag put up by construction workers at a block of flats his company is building in ­Manchester to be taken down.",
      "‘To justify his actions, he claimed that the flag is being used by “angry middle-aged white men” in a “negative fashion”.",
      "‘Quite how you fly a Union Flag ­negatively I am not sure.’",
      "Clark continued: ‘So, no, we have no reason to be ashamed of our flag.",
      "‘On the contrary, we have every reason to fly it proudly from our homes and workplaces — if only the likes of Gary Neville will let us.’",
      "",
      "‘It seems it’s now open season on middle-aged white blokes, all year round. We are the opposite of a protected species. Scape-gammon, if you will. No one will call Neville out on his bigotry, or indeed hypocrisy, as he forgets who paid for the lifestyle he’s enjoyed since the Major years.",
      "‘Neville didn’t just raise a few questions – he also took a wild leap into scape-squirrel territory. He blamed flag-waving middle-aged white men for murders committed by a terrorist literally called Jihad.’",
      "",
      "‘It seems that in modern Britain you can be anything but the dreaded “middle-aged white man” (a description which, it should be noted, also applies to Neville).’",

      "Gary Neville likely knew the reaction his comments would evoke, but did he know the furore ‘won’t stop until he’s taken off Sky and his Overlap podcast’?",

      "A bad defeat against arch-rivals Liverpool will potentially be enough to spell an end to his sorry time at Old Trafford.",
      "There were flickers of positivity to take from the win over Sunderland as Senne Lammens had a positive debut, while Benjamin Sesko and Bryan Mbeumo continue to find their feet, but Man Utd are still miles away from where they want to be, and there is little evidence of the club ending their prolonged era of misery.",
      "READ: Man United isn’t just a CRISIS club – it’s a CRISIS club in CRISIS purgatory with no means of escape",

      "And while Amorim’s stubbornness is one of Man Utd’s biggest issues, the weak character of the squad is arguably even more concerning.",
      "Over at the F365 tables, some damning findings can be found on Man Utd’s start to this season.",
      "Firstly, Man Utd are bottom of our second half table, having only picked up four points after the break from their seven games.",
      "It is a different story with the first half table as United are in a far more respectable position of eighth, as all three of their wins this season were earned via their play in the opening 45 minutes.",
      "There is a similar theme with our conceding first table as Man Utd are 19th in those standings, while they are sixth in the table when scoring first.",
      "Also, Man Utd are joint-bottom of the Premier League on points gained from losing positions, with Amorim’s side yet to pick up a single point after going behind this season.",
      "And the main takeaway from these findings is that their glaring weakness is clear: this Man Utd squad has no backbone and their fragile players wilt at the earliest sign of adversity.",
      "This mindset has been an epidemic at Man Utd for years, and it will eventually contribute to Amorim losing his job, as it has with previous post-Sir Alex Ferguson.",

With Fergie at the helm, United literally could not fail. That final title he won before retirement is an almost sarcastic display of achievement despite a club drifting blithely and obliviously towards disaster.",
      "Ferguson left a United playing staff that absolutely nobody else could succeed with, because he might just be the best football manager of all time and nobody else is that.",
      "Unlike, say, Jurgen Klopp and his succession planning at Liverpool, Ferguson did almost nothing to set the next manager up to succeed beyond declaring poor old David Moyes the Chosen One.

      "We genuinely don’t know what that would even look like any more. A non-crisis Manchester United. Can you even imagine such a thing? They’ve tried new players. They’ve tried new managers. They’ve tried new owners. If anything, it always just somehow gets worse. Despite that often appearing to be literally impossible.",
      "It’s still less than a year, for instance, since Erik Ten Hag’s embarrassing banter reign that was saved by outplaying and beating a peak Man City side to win the FA Cup after an eighth-place finish was seen as the lowest United could possibly, feasibly sink. By the time of his long-inevitable departure it was widely agreed that this was surely United’s nadir.",
      "Roll on 11 months and they’re ‘turning a corner’ by beating Sunderland at home to climb to 10th.",
      "It might be an impossible task to ever get Manchester United back to the absurd levels of dominance and success they enjoyed during the ’90s and ’00s, but with every attempt to relocate that spark they drift further and further from even basic big-club competence.",
      "So you end up with a situation where United become the perfect storm. As the biggest club in the country it already takes far less for them to be in crisis than it does for Joe Mid-Table-Battler or Johnny Yo-Yo-Club, yet they have also contrived to be actually bad enough to constitute crisis at any of those clubs as well.",
      "In essence they are deeper down the crisis well than any other club you care to name, yet because TIMUFCWTA they also have much further to climb to escape it any way. We don’t know what a solution might even look like.",
      "But what we can say with some confidence is that it doesn’t look like Ruben Amorim. We really did think it might for a while there. He has the requisite charm and charisma to pull off the performance aspect of being Manchester United Manager. But while you can’t succeed in this job without that, it still isn’t enough on its own.",
      "Because, again, his record isn’t just ‘Bad for Manchester United’ bad; it’s ‘Bad for any Premier League club’ bad. It is relegation-form bad. The only other Premier League clubs with records anywhere near as bad as Amorim’s since he took over have all changed managers because of it, including one who did so out of sheer embarrassment at only beating United 1-0 in a European final.",
      "It’s far more symptom than cause of Manchester United’s ongoing crisis status, but the continued inability to string two wins together is a great bit. It was a running joke during Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s time that every month or so United would turn a corner down yet another cul-de-sac, but Amorim has perfected it.",
      "The list of terrible Premier League managers who have at least managed to win two games in a row is a hilarious one, and the fact Amorim talked openly about it before the botched chance at Brentford is revealing in itself.",
      "While the record is specifically around league games, it also highlights just how damaging United’s failure to a) qualify for Europe and then b) avoid total Carabao catastrophe at Grimsby has been.",
      "Because their near total lack of midweek football just gives no chance for any forward momentum to develop while allowing whatever the latest setback might be to moulder and fester for an entire week. United are definitely in their own heads to an uncomfortable degree on this ‘two wins’ thing.",
      "And it also means less chance of some easier games to help things along. You only have to look at Villa right now to see how even a bit of gentle Thursday night Euroball can help change the mood.",
      "United don’t have that option. They don’t have any option. For this once-mighty club, there is no light at the end of the tunnel. There is no end to the tunnel.",
      "Ruben Amorim has barely survived one international break but could fall into the trap of another, with Sir Jim Ratcliffe minded to follow Daniel Levy.",
      "Ruben Amorim being sacked by Manchester United is justified by three factors that potentially set up a relegation battle for the Premier League giants…",
      "Ally McCoist and Rio Ferdinand thinks Man Utd boss Ruben Amorim should be given “more time” at Old Trafford amid sack rumours.",
      "Gary Neville likely knew the reaction his comments would evoke, but did he know the furore ‘won’t stop until he’s taken off Sky and his Overlap podcast’?",
      "Manchester United have been ‘not good’ and ’embarrassing at times’ but the Ruben Amorim sack calls continue because of one game – and his ‘ridiculous’ subs.",
      "Aleksander Ceferin and UEFA *have* set a precedent allowing domestic league games to be played overseas. Claiming otherwise is disingenuous."

      "The Red Devils had a terrible 2024/25 season with Ruben Amorim’s side finishing 15th in the Premier League and failing to qualify for European competition.",
      "Only four Premier League sides scored fewer goals than Man Utd last term with Zirkzee and Rasmus Hojlund criticised for scoring just seven league goals between them.",
      "Hojlund left on loan for Serie A champions Napoli over the summer, which will probably turn into a permanent transfer, while Zirkzee stayed at Man Utd as back-up.",
      "The Red Devils spent around £200m on attackers in the summer transfer window with Benjamin Sesko, Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo arriving.",

      "And no the Daily Mail claim that Zirkzee is ‘deeply frustrated at his situation, and a move in the January transfer window is seen as absolutely crucial if he is to force his way back into the reckoning for the Netherlands’ World Cup squad next summer’.",
      "The report adds: ‘Chido Obi’s return to the academy setup after he played eight times for the first team last season may see United dig in to keep Zirkzee as back-up, in case anything happens to first-choice striker and £74m summer signing Benjamin Sesko.",
      "‘But there is no doubt that Zirkzee’s frustration has escalated significantly in recent weeks, and now his only chance to salvage a season that could cost him a spot at the World Cup appears to be by trying to secure a move away in January.’",
      "Football Insider have a similar report claiming that Zirkzee is set for a ‘surprise exit in January’ with Serie A sides Inter Milan, Juventus and Como ‘looking at the Dutchman’, while West Ham have also joined the race.",
      "Zirkzee has once again been left out of Ronald Koeman’s Netherlands squad for the October international break and the Dutch head coach said back in March that his performances had not been “good enough” to warrant a place in the setup.",

      "These are the same people – Oliver Brown chief among them – who went after Gary Lineker for years, stamping their feet and having tantrums until they finally got what they wanted.",
      "The nature of these people is such that they always have to have some fresh meat to satisfy their bloodlust. They are truly warped and damaged individuals who either genuinely believe in the ill informed weapons-grade bollocks they spout, or worse, they spout it because they don’t want to upset the people who write their pay cheques.",
      "Like Lineker, Neville has a big platform. He has millions of people who listen to his views on a variety of topics. Some of those views terrify these people because the old media ecosystems of a select number of newspapers and 5 TV channels died a long time ago. Whereas back in the day they could just isolate anyone with a centre or centre left view, they can’t anymore. Social media scares them because they can’t control it. It’s sheer terror, raging against the dying of the light.",

      "Sadly, instead of trust in and development of youth, they’ve been used as a scapegoat while the core of the team is the oldest and worst, the players we cannot get rid of – players far worse than the “bomb squad”; the likes of Dalot, Shaw, Casemiro, Maguire.",
      "I don’t care who the manager is, whether they smile in press conferences or what system they play. I don’t even mind a few losses on the journey, but what I do care about is building a side for the future, and that work has to start now.",
      "Continuing to pick Bruno at CM is misguided at best, but a central partnership with Casemiro rather than letting Mainoo, Ugarte or Collyer develop into the role is the definition of short-term thinking and a suicide note and should be considered as much.",
      "Maybe he’ll finally change his ways. But just like every defence of Amorim, it’s entirely based on hypotheticals, and after nearly a year, that’s not enough.\nBadwolf",

      "So I keep hearing how other clubs need to click. Man City are transitioning. When Liverpool’s attack clicks, the league will feel it. So Arsenal’s attack will not click? or Chelsea’s attack? Basically, if you look at Man City 1st XI, basically the same team, bar Tejinders and Donnarumma. When you look at Liverpool’s 1st XI, same team, bar Wirtz, Isak, and Kerkez (I do not rate Frimpong, because whoever decided to buy a wing back who can’t cross or defend as a full back should be queried), and if you look at Arsenal’s 1st XI, basically the same team bar Zubimendi, Gyokeres, and Eze.",
      "One of the managers has never won a league title, but I hear stuff like when Liverpool attack clicks, Man City are transitioning, someone even wrote in today, and I quote, “more familiarity in selection. Arsenal got in 8 new players !!!!!!. We need to click too. We need our medical team to sort itself out so we get our players back. We are a work in Progress. Remember, we have never won the league",
      "As an aside, Wirtz was brought in to mitigate Trent’s deep-lying creativity;  most teams will get a deep-lying playmaker. its the logical thing to do as pure No. 10s are a dying breed, but Not Slot, he opted for a No. 10 who played his best and most productive football in his career in a team that had a deep-lying line-breaking playmaker (Xhaka), and did not get any DM with DLP characteristics, although Endo is not really fit for purpose. Secondly, Luiz Diaz left; he was marginally superior to Gakpo. Was he replaced? No. Slot decided Chiesa and Rio will step in, that way Gakpo isn’t challenged anymore, and I remember Elliot coming on for a tired Salah in Paris against PSG, that was also not replaced. I keep wondering why he did not get quality alternatives to his countrymen.",

The initial contact outside the box wasn’t enough… and you should also know, it was Michael Oliver on VAR, so it had to be Stonewall to qualify.",
      "No fuss regarding Paulinha at spurs celebrating a last minute equalizer with his shirty off vs wolves who had lost their first five. If that was an Arsenal player…",
      "Same goes for Maresca going full Mourinho with a winner vs Liverpool like he’d won the league. If that was Arteta…",
      "Last week we had the absolute gems from Newcastle fans saying Gabriel should have been sent off for some handbags with Woltermade and completely ignoring LaScelles going full Nic Cage/John Travolta and trying to swap faces with Gyokeres.",
      "The list is endless. I actually dont have any issue with over exuberant celebrations,  or the tribal ignorance. I get it, go mental, defend your club, you’ve won a game and show you care, but the absolute double standard is amazing to see.",

In his humble opinion, after being shown Ickle Mikel’s light bulb speech, he politely eviscerated it (after stifling a chuckle). He cited the example of the All Blacks’ manager being asked if the team talks he used to do were more for himself than the team. The team, when asked whether they were even paying attention, told him they weren’t taking the slightest bit of notice. So they stopped, because the manager had enough humility to do so, and because it wasn’t adding anything to the overall objective: Win (not the dog Mikel).",
      "The underlying theory being that if you need to cosplay David Brent in the moments before the players go out for kick off, then something is wrong in your match prep. Obviously most managers do some sort of brief team talk, but very few that I am aware of do the kind of cringe whiteboard work that Legohead loves so much.\nRHT/TS x",
      "",
      "Of course pointing at Arsenal when you are dropping points is not the game and that mailbox contributor should wind it in. But I wouldn’t say that you can lose a 5 point lead in gameweek 7. Teams play each other at different times in the season and earn their points at different times. I am of course very much looking forward to playing a promoted team, an Ange Postecoglou team and West Ham at home.",
      "Whilst it is a Rafa fact that Liverpool are playing badly, when did a visit to Stamford Bridge become a 3 point banker? Even if Liverpool were playing very well, there is no reason to expect 3 points from there. Same for Glasner’s Palace away. Galatasaray was what it was. A one nil loss to a weak pen in Turkey in a phase of the Champions League where the prize for coming top of the league is playing PSG. Its just about getting to the next phase. The team with the most points in the group, now league phase, rarely win the tournament.",
      "But Liverpool are playing badly. There’s very little coaching time this time of the season. Its 2 games a week, international break, 2 games a week and now another international week. Although Slot won’t be with his players, hopefully he and his brain trust can work something out otherwise City are starting to look dangerous and we could be looking at third!

      "Paul Scholes wants Newcastle United boss Eddie Howe to replace Ruben Amorim at Manchester United and the pundit may be onto something.",
      "Man Utd’s much-needed 2-0 win against Sunderland in their final match before this month’s international break did little to ease pressure on head coach Ruben Amorim, who still appears to be on the brink at Old Trafford.",
      "In truth, it feels like it’ll only be a matter of time before he is dismissed, as he’s yet to win back-to-back Premier League games, has 19 losses in 50 matches overall and there is no sign of Man Utd making required progress following a busy summer transfer window.",
      "Amorim’s failing 3-4-3 system and his blunt refusal to adapt to get the best of his players/earn positive results will be the main reasons for his eventual downfall at Man Utd, who could be left to look for a new manager around a year after appointing the inexperienced 40-year-old.",
      "With Amorim sitting uncomfortably as the second favourite to be the next Premier League manager sacked, his exit could come as soon as the aftermath of their trip to Anfield to face Liverpool on October 19.",
      "READ: The one ‘ridiculous’ mistake Amorim keeps repeating which could ‘cost’ him his job at Man Utd",
      "So with that, Man Utd are already being linked with every Tom, Dick and Harry as potential replacements, with Scholes floating Eddie as a potential solution.",
      "“Eddie Howe, Eddie Howe,” Scholes said on The Overlap when discussing who should replace Amorim at Man Utd.",
      "“I’m not sure about his mate [assistant manager Jason Tindall], but definitely him.”",
      "We are “not sure about his mate” either, Paul.",
      "Howe is a left-field shout from Scholes, but this suggestion does make sense.",
      "Widespread reports have indicated that Crystal Palace’s Oliver Glasner and AFC Bournemouth’s Andoni Iraola are actually at the top of Man Utd’s agenda, while ex-England boss Gareth Southgate continues to be mentioned as a possible candidate.",
      "The Southgate links are largely sparked by his reported strong relationship with Man Utd co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe, but it is hardly surprising that most fans are not on board, as the 55-year-old does not exactly have a glittering managerial record at club level.",
      "Still, the biggest potential positive with appointing Southgate is his ability to galvanise a fractured group of players and inspire great results, with this among his best achievements as England boss.",
      "And Howe also possesses this quality, as he’s proven at Newcastle United that he has a unique ability to bring a whole club together, which he has done to an impressive extent in the PIF era at St James’ Park.",
      "The current version of Man Utd is nothing if not splintered and this is largely the doing of Ratcliffe and INEOS, who have alienated themselves by making brutal and sometimes needless cuts since taking control of the club.",
      "But a manager in the mould of Howe or Southgate would unite the Premier League giants, though the Newcastle boss is the superior candidate due to his impressive coaching pedigree at the top level of the club game.",
      "Howe certainly stands out among a bad bunch as the best English manager around at the moment, with his tactical adaptability, his insistence on great work ethic and his front-foot football lending itself perfectly to Man Utd.",
      "Would he leave Newcastle United for Man Utd? He’d be daft to at this stage, but Benjamin Sesko, Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha proved where the two clubs lie on the footballing food chain by opting for the Red Devils in the summer. If push came to shove, it would not be a shock if Howe followed suit.",

      "We were all wrong about Liverpool, Florian Wirtz and Benjamin Sesko as these ten 2025/26 Premier League knee-jerk reactions have already been debunked…",
      "Ahead of this season, Liverpool were many people’s favourites to win the Premier League once again, with it becoming the overwhelming consensus that they would do so at a canter once they won their opening five games and Arsenal stuttered in their opening matches.",
      "However, the wheels have fallen off in recent weeks as Liverpool descended into a mini-crisis ahead of the international break, losing three away games in a row against Crystal Palace, Galatasaray and Chelsea.",
      "In truth, the warning signs were there before this sobering run of results, with Liverpool relying on last-minute goals and moments of magic to overshadow subpar team performances during their winning start.",
      "And in their last three games, Liverpool’s luck has run out as they have suffered three deserved defeats, while Arsenal have capitalised to move to the top of the table.",
      "It was initially felt that Liverpool’s statement £400m+ summer spend on signings would make them unstoppable in the Premier League this season. However, it now appears that head coach Arne Slot has made too many changes in a single window and his side’s severe lack of balance at least means they will not steamroll Arsenal and others en route to their 21st crown.",
      "READ: Top ten Premier League defectors features more players from Liverpool than Man Utd",
      "",
      "One such change has seen Slot tweak his midfield and introduce a natural No.10 following the once-British record signing of Wirtz from Bayer Leverkusen for £116m.",
      "Beating Bayern Munich and Manchester City to Wirtz set Liverpool’s stall out for a remarkable summer window, with the special 22-year-old backed heavily as a pre-season favourite to win this season’s PFA Player of the Year award.",
      "But it says a lot about how Wirtz has performed for Liverpool to date that he has suddenly dropped from first to sixth in our ranking of the likeliest winners of this accolade in 2025/26.",
      "007 has become 009 as Wirtz, barring the odd flashes of quality, has been ineffective in all of Liverpool’s Premier League and Champions League matches this season, though he has also been impacted by Slot’s side failing to operate as a unit, with players in all positions suffering.",
      "Wirtz will eventually come to life for Liverpool because he’s too good not to, but he already has very little, if any, chance of picking up the PFA Player of the Year award at the end of his debut season at Anfield.",
      "",
      "This season is huge for Arsenal and head coach Mikel Arteta, who have no excuses remaining as they finally look to win big prizes following so many near misses in recent seasons.",
      "After spending around £250m on summer signings, Arteta arguably has the most complete squad in the Premier League with quality options in every position and were Arsenal to come up short, it has been suggested that their head coach’s overreliance on the handbrake would be their undoing.",
      "This argument was brought up as Arsenal left points on the table against Manchester City and Liverpool, though Arteta has implemented changes to put this right in recent weeks.",
      "Arteta went for the proverbial jugular against Newcastle United and his newfound attacking intent reaped rewards as Arsenal earned a 2-1 comeback away victory, which already feels massive. And there was confirmation of a turning point in their next game as he experimented with Eberechi Eze and Martin Odegaard in an exciting midfield three alongside Declan Rice against West Ham.",
      "So, for now at least, Arteta appears to have binned his handbrake as recent victories have given him the blueprint on how to overcome the low block and win while chasing a game, which could be pivotal in this season’s title race.",
      "MUST-READ PREMIER LEAGUE FEATURES ON F365…\n👉 Premier League winners and losers: Arsenal, Postecoglou, Liverpool, Amorim, Spurs, Maresca\n👉 Ange clear Sack Race favourite but Liverpool ‘mini-crisis’ sees Arne Slot level with Scott Parker\n👉 No Liverpool players in Premier League XI of the season so far as striker drops out",

      "Everyone associated with Liverpool and Arsenal would have let out an audible gulp when Man City hammered Wolves 4-0 away on the opening weekend via a brace from Erling Haaland and goals from summer signings Tijjani Reijnders and Rayan Cherki.",
      "However, those same individuals breathed a sigh of relief as Man City followed this big win up with back-to-back losses against Spurs and Brighton, suggesting that Pep Guardiola’s winning machine may not be fully fixed after all.",
      "Man City are certainly in a better position than last season as Phil Foden’s return to form and Gianluigi Donnarumma’s great start have been huge positives, while Haaland has taken his goalscoring and overall game to extraordinary new heights.",
      "Still, this Man City squad is a far cry from the champions of years gone by, with their fragility proven by their opponents’ lack of fear when facing Guardiola’s side who, even with Donnarumma in goal, look shaky at the back and are struggling to put teams away. They will be fine for the top four again, but it’s too soon in their rebuild phase to seriously challenge Liverpool and Arsenal.",
      "",
      "Chelsea’s Club World Cup final win over Paris-Saint Germain felt like a coming-out party for Enzo Maresca’s side after they showed great resilience to finish in the top four and win the Europa Conference League to take pressure off of the head coach.",
      "And some argued that their Club World Cup triumph would propel them to being credible Premier League title challengers this season and winners in the next couple of years, but their start to this campaign has indicated that they are in a similar position to 2024/25 and how swiftly an outlook for a manager can change.",
      "The Maresca sack hype picked up last month as Chelsea lost three games in five and their only win was against League One side Lincoln City in the Carabao Cup.",
      "The pressure on Maresca has eased following much-needed wins over Benfica and Liverpool, though Chelsea are lacking a top-quality goalkeeper and centre-back required to take them to the next level.",
      "",
      "“I can only congratulate them in Stuttgart for finding, so to speak, an idiot who would pay that much money, because we certainly wouldn’t have done that.”",
      "Former Bayern Munich chairman Karl-Heinz Rummenigge exemplified the clear bitterness of the Bundesliga champions with this childish dig at Newcastle United over paying £69m to sign Woltemade.",
      "Yes, Newcastle’s desperation to land a suitable replacement for Alexander Isak was exploited by Stuttgart as the Premier League side overpaid to sign Woltemade, who headed to England relatively unproven after only one good season in the German top flight.",
      "But Woltemade sparkled at the summer’s U21 European Championships and has expertly handled the immense pressure of succeeding Isak, with the confidence boost of a debut goal certainly helping his cause.",
      "The 23-year-old has a credible case to be one of the signings of the summer after scoring four goals in his opening seven games, especially considering the pressure he’s under amid the absence of fellow arrival Yoane Wissa. Rummenigge is actually the “idiot”…",
      "",
      "There was a ridiculous early-season clamour for Emery to be sacked by Aston Villa amid their alarming start to this campaign.",
      "In hindsight, everyone should have seen this coming following their failure to secure Champions League qualification, limited transfer activity and speculation surrounding the futures of several key players.",
      "The Premier League’s PSR rules have stuffed Aston Villa more than most, with these factors contributing to Villa finding themselves in the Premier League relegation zone at the start of this season.",
      "The loss of form of Morgan Rogers and Ollie Watkins has made Aston Villa goal-shy, but Emery has found some answers as they have dug deep to climb out of the mire with four consecutive wins in all competitions.",
      "Villa still have their issues with a squad of lesser quality than last season and they will likely struggle to replicate their 2024/25 sixth-place finish, but Emery remains the most important person at Villa and it was daft for anyone to think that they would be better off without him.",
      "",
      "By signing up-and-coming forward Sesko instead of a proven upgrade, e.g. Viktor Gyokeres or Victor Osimhen, to solve their striker problem, Man Utd ran the risk of landing another Hojlund.",
      "In his first season at Old Trafford, Hojlund proved his worth by netting a respectable tally of 16 goals in all competitions, but his second year was a completely different story as he lost all of his confidence and was a shell of his best self.",
      "So it was understandable that United felt he needed to be offloaded and replaced in the summer, with INEOS eventually settling on Sesko, a similar profile of striker, to succeed the Napoli newbie at Old Trafford.",
      "As expected, Sesko immediately came under scrutiny at Man Utd and was quickly written off amid his slow start, but he’s gradually found his feet by scoring in his last two Premier League games. Hojlund, meanwhile, has been a revelation at Napoli, netting four goals in six games, to make a permanent transfer “almost guaranteed”.",
      "The respective performances of these strikers in recent weeks suggest that they have the tools to succeed at Man Utd, though that is heavily dependent on the service provided to them; Sesko is currently dealing with this better than Hojlund did.",
      "",
      "It was hard not to worry about Brentford as they lost Thomas Frank, Bryan Mbeumo and Wissa in a single window, while outsiders feared for the worst once they appointed novice boss Andrews to replace their beloved predecessor.",
      "And while these worries were backed up by their 3-1 opening weekend loss to Nottingham Forest, Brentford and Andrews have recovered in their subsequent matches.",
      "Helped by the goalscoring of fit-again Igor Thiago and inspired summer signing Jordan Henderson, Brentford have moved out of the bottom three via Andrews schooling Ruben Amorim and beating Aston Villa.",
      "Brentford still are expected to be in the bottom six this season as they have a weaker squad than recent years, but Andrews is quickly proving himself to be capable of the head coach’s role and it would not be a shock at all if he guides them to survival.",
      "",
      "The fight at the bottom is certainly more interesting than it’s been in recent seasons and this is largely thanks to the promoted sides recruiting well and making necessary tactical tweaks to make them more competitive at this level.",
      "Sunderland have been a breath of fresh air under Regis Le Bris and certainly look the most likely of the promoted teams to survive, while Leeds United, despite their lack of bite in attack, have shored up defensively to give themselves a strong platform to secure positive results.",
      "Burnley also acquitted themselves well in their opening couple of matches, but it has been more of the same since the end of August, with Scott Parker’s side only picking up a single point since their sole Premier League win of the campaign against Sunderland.",
      "This already leaves the Clarets in the bottom three and it’s difficult to see a significant improvement en route to another relegation without a scrap due to their newfound defensive frailties and their attack being even worse than it seems as they overperform their xG.",
      "Former Bayern Munich and Manchester United midfielder Bastian Schweinsteiger has allayed fears for Florian Wirtz, stating he himself had to “adjust a bit” and the midfielder will “delight us all” ...",
      "Germany national team director Rudi Voller has told Liverpool the “big difference” for Florian Wirtz between there and Bayer Leverkusen which is hurting his adjustment to his new side.",
      "Manchester United legend Rio Ferdinand reckons Arsenal boss Mikel Arteta will be “thanking God” that he signed Eberechi Eze over the summer.",
      "Liverpool summer signing Florian Wirtz could be given the chance to leave Anfield as early as next year with Real Madrid interested, according to reports.",
      "Arsenal will be praying for a potentially game-changing reprieve after Mikel Arteta’s new experiment against West Ham United confirmed a turning point…",
      "According to Fabrizio Romano, a key Arsenal star will sign a new contract “soon”, while one factor “really made the difference” with William Saliba."

      "Send your thoughts to theeditor@football365.com.",
      "Before the season started I wrote in saying how I’d be very happy if United reached the second international break with 12 points. Well so far we’ve had two terrible performances against City and Brentford, two good performances against Arsenal and Sunderland, two half and half performances against Fulham and Burnley, then one sort of good but also sort of not performance against Chelsea. A properly mixed bag resulting in 10 points.",
      "I’m not happy with that but given the fine margins involved I am content for the moment. If Bruno scores that penalty against Fulham or Collins is sent off in the Brentford game (as Webb has now admitted should have happened) then perhaps we’d be where I wanted. No amount of whataboutery could put a positive spin on this season so far though I think it’s reasonable to say United are within the margins of error for my preseason expectations.",
      "Don’t get me wrong, we’re not good and have been embarrassing at times, but outside of the Grimsby result I don’t think there is enough to seriously consider a managerial change at the moment. I think much of the despair from fans and the pressure on Amorim is linked with that cup exit which will linger and even grow until a decent run of form is achieved.",
      "Speaking of which, the next yardstick I suggested preseason was around 30 points by Christmas. Beyond the next game away at Liverpool where I expect no points (regardless of their tiny blip in form they are massive favourites for the win) there will be 9 league games to achieve this. So at minimum its 5 wins and a few draws to stay within the margin of error of +/- one result. There are some particularly tough games in that run (Spurs, Palace, and Bournemouth) but the whole league is tough so if Amorim can’t get it done now he likely never will.",
      "He made a few subtle changes to his system against Sunderland with an almost 4-4-2 formation out of possession which may help going forward. However, the centre back subs are getting a bit ridiculous now. I wouldn’t mind if there was any perceivable advantage. De Ligt has been great in the central role but is a lost and panicking mess whenever he’s asked to be a wide centre back. Why then keep moving him out there just so you can bring on Harry Maguire instantly making the defence significantly slower and more vulnerable? More than systems or formations or whatever its those kind of decisions that will cost us late goal and perhaps ultimately Amorim’s job.\nDave, Manchester",

      "The defending champions and the serial champions prior to them haven’t “clicked” but the team at the top of the table despite their injuries and tough schedule should’ve seen off the competition by week 6 of 38… because of net spend (we never talk wages though)? Ha!",

      "Similar to shin splints and unexploded World War II bombs, bogey teams were a real phenomenon in the 1990s but at some point in the intervening years, they fell away from the forefront of our collective thoughts. However, Everton appear to have brought the idea back: according to the Athletic, they have only won three times after conceding the first goal in the past few years, and all three of those have been against Crystal Palace. Happy to help, I guess.",
      "Despite the efforts of F365 and other parts of the football media, most people connected to Palace believe becoming a top four club is a bit of a pipe dream, but meaningfully reducing the gap between Palace and the top four is an admirable, achievable goal. This was brought into sharp focus, because if Palace were a top four club, David Moyes wouldn’t have been able to beat them.",
      "A curious game at the This Means Bramley-Moore Stadium, in that neutrals probably enjoyed it more than fans of either team, who will have mixed feelings about how their respective sides played. Crystal Palace completely dominated Everton for significant periods of the game, but only went in 1-0 up at half time against an Everton team booed off by their fans, then tired significantly in the second half, lost their composure, and ended up losing. The Toffees meanwhile, came out for the second half with a different setup (helped by some very effective substitutes), played their way into the game and came away with all three points.",
      "Like all winning teams, Everton’s winner had an element of fortune about it, but there’s no doubt Jack Grealish was in the right place at the right time, doing the right thing, when the ball rebounded off him into the goal. Bit of a rubbish way for the unbeaten run to come to an end but that’s just how it goes sometimes. I don’t think the defeat suggests anything too drastic needs to change for Palace, you can’t plan for players missing gilt-edged chances provided they keep creating chances, and you can’t plan to completely prevent players getting tired, only to mitigate the effects of their fatigue on the rest of the team. It says a lot about how far Palace have come that losing one game is newsworthy.\nEd Quoththeraven",

      "The MailOnline really does need to be careful about calling this a ”racist’ outburst, by the way. That ground seems wafer thin.",
      "Gary Neville’s comments lamenting “the division that’s being created…mainly by angry, middle-aged white men who know exactly what they’re doing,” does appear to have infuriated a great deal of angry, middle-aged white men who do indeed know exactly what they’re doing.",
      "It is definitely easy to see how Neville calling for togetherness and unity, denouncing “hate speech in any form and abuse in any form” and wanting “to get back to a country of love, of peace, of harmony” has incensed and enraged so many people. He must have expected such incendiary, unpleasant words to evoke such a reaction.",
      "And after the single-person BOYCOTT, non-existent sack threat and really quite inflammatory quote marks around ”racist’ outburst’ when no-one described it as such because it wasn’t even close to being applicable, Tuesday brings a full-scale attempt to bring down the nefarious Neville.",
      "The charge is depressingly predictably led by angry, middle-aged white man Oliver Brown of the Daily Telegraph, who lays into ‘a degree of solipsism remarkable even by his own standards’ from Neville – a reminder that his great crime here is wanting people to come together and not hate and kill each other – before landing on that money-making quote:",
      "‘”We need to check ourselves, start to bring ourselves back to a neutral point,” he says, playing the great healer,’ Brown writes.",
      "‘After all, nothing says neutrality quite like blaming the toxicity exclusively on “angry middle-aged white men”.’",
      "And nothing says grift quite like knowing someone said “the division that’s being created…mainly by angry, middle-aged white men who know exactly what they’re doing,” but actually hearing them say those angry middle-aged white men are ‘exclusively’ the problem.",
      "The people Neville ‘disdains’ are those who spread and incite prejudice and hatred based solely on nationality and the colour of someone’s skin. It is only ‘strange’ that we are supposed to pretend he is being unreasonable in that stance.",
      "It is also bizarre that a supposedly reputable journalist can write freely that Neville’s video ‘has provoked less applause than derision and contempt, with increasing threats from viewers to stop paying for Sky in protest,’ without any actual evidence of such. Are those ‘increasing threats’ in the room with us now, Oliver?",
      "‘Neville acts as if his position as the country’s most prominent football analyst also confers the right to be its conscience,’ Brown adds. Think he’s just acting as if he has an opinion and a platform, to be honest. So do you, and yet this is how you choose to use it.",
      "But of course, the ‘deluded’ Neville, much like Gary Lineker, ‘has strayed so far out of his lane that he is practically in the ditch’.",
      "If you want to just write ‘Keep Politics Out Of Football’ you can. No-one is stopping you, pal.",
      "This, by the way, is perhaps Neville’s ‘most dangerous lapse into self-parody yet’.",
      "Ah yes, that ‘dangerous’ rhetoric about wanting people to like each other and not be weaponised or led by hate speech. It’s some ‘self-parody’ from… Neville. When Mediawatch has an update on whether Brown has discovered the concept of irony we will let you know.",

      "And this article, most certainly framed as a criticism and hoping to paint Neville in a negative light, includes such paragraphs as:",
      "‘Neville has often shared his opinions on political issues, such as saying people should ‘detest’ the working conditions for migrant workers in Qatar and condemning Boris Johnson for ‘fuelling’ racism during his time as Prime Minister.’",
      "‘Neville criticised poor working conditions and deaths of migrant employees building the competition infrastructure and the Middle East state’s human rights record.’",
      "‘The millionaire Labour party member gets on well with Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, having shared interview platforms with him several times – and previously criticised Tory ex-PMs Boris Johnson and Rishi Sunak, while also campaigning against Brexit.’",

      "Suggesting people probably shouldn’t have been exploited, abused and even died while building infrastructure for a major football tournament?

      "Us Premier League-centric Football365ers do occasionally venture beyond the green and pleasant land to take in the football that inferior leagues have to offer, obviously paying particular attention to potential Premier League acquisitions and those who took the ill-advised step to leave these shores.",
      "Some of them end up doing rather well (easier, isn’t it?) and we’ve picked out the top ten players who left the Premier League in the summer based on their performances for their new clubs so far. We’ve only considered players in Europe’s top five leagues – or four, as we’re discounting players who have swapped one Premier League club for another – as it’s early days in our journey to full football enlightenment.",
      "If Arne Slot and Richard Hughes weren’t already regretting selling Quansah this summer after failing to land Marc Guehi on deadline day, Ibrahima Konate’s consistent bed-sh*tting since has surely hammered home that remorse.",
      "The 22-year-old scored six minutes into his Leverkusen debut and has played every minute of nine games in all competitions, retaining his place in the starting XI under Kasper Hjulmand after the comically brief tenure of Erik ten Hag. The German side have picked up ten points from their four games under the new manager, conceding just three goals.",
      "When exactly does that buyback clause become active?",
      "",
      "Returned after a season-long loan with Real Sociedad to concede 11 goals in three games for West Ham, and while that evidence suggests he’s a very lucky centre-back to have received the call from Marseille, conceding just one goal in four games for the Ligue 1 side suggests Aguerd may not have been the problem.",
      "",
      "Barcelona president Joan Laporta can’t believe his luck. He and the other Catalan bosses are ‘stunned’ that they will be able to secure Rashford’s £26m ‘massive bargain’ transfer at the end of the season.",
      "After that wholly predictable and depressing hokum about Barcelona wanting to ‘send Rashford home’ after a couple of games, he’s scored three goals – including the outstanding brace against Newcastle at St James’ Park – and claimed five assists to assert himself as a fixture in Hansi Flick’s starting XI.",
      "",
      "Fabian Hurzeler had said he was “100 per cent” confident O’Riley would still be at Brighton come the end of the transfer window, and looked set to rely on him more this season after he started both their opening games and scored the goal in the 1-1 draw with Fulham.",
      "O’Riley said it was a chat with former Seagulls boss Roberto De Zerbi which persuaded him to make the switch to Marseille and it’s paid off so far, with the 24-year-old grabbing a goal and an assist in the most recent of four victories in the four games he’s played so far.",
      "",
      "Despite all evidence to the contrary, even we were doubting whether Hojlund being utterly useless for Manchester United last season was simply because he was playing for Manchester United rather than him maybe, actually, being utterly useless.",
      "After a goal on debut, an outstanding Proper-Striker brace in the Champions League to beat Sporting and the winner against Genoa on Sunday we were kicking ourselves. Of bloody course it was Manchester United’s fault.",
      "",
      "We don’t know whether there’s a build-up of catastrophic errors that will arrive in a disastrous cluster at some stage of the season or whether Muric has managed to remove those brain fades from his game and is now only producing the outstanding displays we did also see from him in the Premier League.",
      "David Raya (83.3%) is the only Premier League goalkeeper with a better save percentage than Muric (82.8%) and no-one in the English top flight comes close to his PSxG minus goals allowed score of +3.1. ‘What the f*** is that?’ you might reasonably ask. Here’s what the f***.",
      "",
      "Unfortunate for the purposes of our continued bid to stoke the mini-crisis fire into becoming a full-blown one that just about the only position on the pitch that we can’t in good conscience claim Liverpool need to improve upon is defensive midfield. Damn you to hell, Ryan Gravenberch.",
      "But the bellows will be out if Arne Slot is forced to turn to Wataru Endo while Morton tears it up in Ligue 1.",
      "He’s slotted straight into the starting lineup as Lyon’s metronome at the base of their midfield, scoring the only goal in a 1-0 victory over Lille last weekend and helping them to fourth in the table, just one point behind league leaders PSG.",
      "",
      "Only ridiculous teammate Harry Kane (9.14) has a higher WhoScored rating in the Bundesliga than Luis Diaz (8.17) and no Premier League player can match that, with Erling Haaland (7.89) leading the way. Cody Gakpo (7.16) is Liverpool’s highest-rated forward.",
      "Diaz is also second behind Kane (11) in what admittedly doesn’t look like much of a race for the goalscorer’s cannon with five goals and no-one has more than his four assists.",
      "",
      "Not one single person thought De Bruyne would be anything other than brilliant for Napoli. Three goals and two assists in eight games isn’t outstanding, and Antonio Conte raised eyebrows after leaving him out of the starting lineup for Genoa on Sunday, but his impact off the bench illustrated just how key he will be if Napoli are to win back-to back Scudettos.",
      "The famously spiky Italian boss insisted “we understand each other perfectly” amid rumours of an all-too predictable rift between the pair after De Bruyne was instrumental in Hojlund’s game-winning goal.",
      "",
      "El Khannouss put himself firmly in the ‘there’s something about him’ category through his performances for Leicester last season. At just 20, having moved from the Jupiler Pro League, he looked perfectly at home in the Premier League and quite reasonably didn’t fancy the step down to the Championship having proven his mettle in a big five league.",
      "El Khannouss revealed that Pep Guardiola told him after a Manchester City clash with Leicester that “he was impressed with my play” and after both Arsenal and Tottenham were linked with him in the summer, we fully expect the Premier League elite to come calling again at the end of this season, after a start which has seen the playmaker score three goals in six games.",
      "Ruben Amorim has barely survived one international break but could fall into the trap of another, with Sir Jim Ratcliffe minded to follow Daniel Levy.",
      "The question with Manchester United is not ‘are they in a crisis?’ but ‘how do they stop being in a crisis?’ And we really don’t know if there’s an answer.",
      "Gary Neville likely knew the reaction his comments would evoke, but did he know the furore ‘won’t stop until he’s taken off Sky and his Overlap podcast’?",

      "If you wanted to learn how best to speedrun the all-too frequent flopping of young Manchester United footballers in the stress cauldron that that football club has become, Peter Schmeichel is putting on a clinic.",
      "A search for reasons as to why talented footballers arrive at the club and often briefly show promise before crumbling under the pressure should provide cause for introspection for the members of the Manchester United punditry caucus, who are absolutely just doing their jobs, but could also do with avoiding being so entirely hot and then cold, or vice versa, in their assessments of these players.",
      "“We should have signed Emi Martinez,” Peter Schmeichel said just over two weeks ago. “In fact, we should have gone for Gianluigi Donnarumma when we had the chance.",
      "“As for Lammens, I’ll be honest, I’d never heard of him until the link came up. I know his stats are excellent across the top ten European leagues. But that was with Antwerp in Belgium, in a team that finished fifth.",
      "“Stats don’t show how you react after a mistake, or how you cope with the pressure of Manchester United. That pressure is unlike anywhere else in football.",
      "“Lammens could turn out to be the best signing ever – but right now, it feels like a hopeful one, and that’s not what United need at this moment in time.”",
      "Lammens could be the kind of guy to use that as motivation, but may also have found it hard to ignore a legendary Manchester United goalkeeper a) admitting he doesn’t know who the f*** he is, b) insisting United should have signed someone else and c) ramping up the pressure by questioning his ability to cope with it.",
      "And yet, after one (one!?) appearance for Manchester United, in which the fans serenaded the 22-year-old with chants of “are you Schmeichel in disguise”, one would hope with their tongues at least somewhere near their cheeks given he didn’t do an awful lot, Schmeichel claimed there was “some semblance to Edwin [van der Sar]”.",
      "“First of all, it’s nice to see a clean sheet, then a really good and solid goalkeeping performance,” Schmeichel said.",
      "“It’s what you see, you see this young lad, he didn’t really have much to do for a long, long time, he literally only had the ball at his feet and he did quite well.",
      "“You’d expect that from any young goalkeeper these days – as that’s how they’re brought up – so there was some resemblance to Edwin, a couple of long balls, he had that first save down to his left, which you expect him to save, but once he’s done that, he’s a goalkeeper now, he’s saving balls.”",
      "Schmeichel did caveat his praise for Lammens by insisting “it’s far too early to talk about if this guy is good or not”, but you can’t help but laugh at Schmeichel’s admission that “it would be silly for someone like me to put more pressure on him” less than a minute after comparing him to one of the greatest Premier League goalkeepers of all time.",
      "We get that he was asked about him and Lammens might not even be aware of what he’s said, but plenty of fans will have heard that and many will have read the article published by the official Manchester United website titled ‘LAMMENS: KEEPER OF PROMISE”. Again, after one actual game of football.",
      "We love a kneekerk reaction, and balls in a vice, we would say Lammens looks like the real deal. But we have no skin in the game. If anything, another United goalkeeper being terrible is much more fun and thus more clickable for the majority of our readers.",
      "Maybe Schmeichel and the rest of the cabal of United pundits are of a similar mind. Is it in their best interests for their former club to continue being a mess? If it’s not, we really think they should avoid comparing a goalkeeper with one Premier League appearance to another who’s won it four times.",
      "Manchester United head coach Ruben Amorim has decided to ‘throw’ one of his players in at the deep end against Sunderland amid INEOS’ ‘bullish’ verdict.",

And then when it comes to the games, doing exactly what he asked for. And I think, as you see today, we stuck to the job in hand.",
      "“Everyone did their roles and responsibilities and it was a good performance. I think in the second half it got a bit cagey and there were times where we had to defend. We had to put the body on the line.”",

      "And the 2025/26 side aren’t the only Arsenal team to have had a good weekend, thanks to Crystal Palace’s first defeat of the season, while mini-crisis-ridden Liverpool and the world’s most beleaguered man, Ange Postecoglou, take their place among the losers.",
      "Other more cheerful sorts include Tottenham, Bournemouth, Antoine Semenyo, the inevitable Erling Haaland and smiling philosopher-poet Jack Grealish.",
      "Some Gunners didn’t really like it when we called them favourites for the Premier League last week. They’ve no choice about that now.",
      "We do understand the fear. To be called favourites is to invite tiresome accusations of bottle jobs if you end up second again. It’s no longer acceptable in the nuance-free culture war age even to just call second place first loser; second place is first bottler. When it’s happened three years in a row already and your last title is over 20 years ago, the reticence to accept the favourites mantle is understandable.",
      "But there is simply no avoiding it. Arsenal are the best team in the country, and their second XI is probably about the fourth or fifth best team in the country.",
      "They negotiated a horribly tough opening set of fixtures without suffering terminal damage – which was a valid concern given how little margin for error Premier League title challenges now permit – and they have now taken top spot as we hit the second interlull and look perfectly placed to really stretch their legs and open up a gap.",
      "Arsenal’s four Premier League games before the November international break are against Fulham, Crystal Palace, Burnley and Sunderland.",
      "Liverpool’s are against Manchester United, Brentford, Aston Villa and Man City.",
      "Man City’s are against Everton, Aston Villa, Bournemouth and Liverpool.",
      "Opportunity is knocking unignorably loudly right here, right now for Mikel Arteta and his side having successfully avoided the distinctly Arsenally trap they’ve tumbled into at home to West Ham in each of the last two seasons, despite pairing those bizarre home defeats to nil against the Hammers with 6-0 and 5-2 wins at the London Stadium.",
      "",
      "The first weekend of October, and already their defeat-avoiding ridiculousness is sure to go unmatched for another season.",
      "",
      "It hasn’t been a comfortable start to the season for Newcastle after a difficult summer overshadowed by The Isak Unpleasantness, but there are now plenty of reasons to feel pretty encouraged about what comes next.",
      "Their only defeats have been against Liverpool, Barcelona and Arsenal, and two of those were only sealed in heartbreakingly late fashion.",
      "Apart from that elite trio, the only team to even score against Newcastle this season is Bradford in the Carabao, and that came when an already much-changed team had made four further in-game changes while leading 3-0.",
      "Newcastle’s defence and midfield were impeccably solid on Sunday, albeit against a Forest side and manager currently providing a real-time six-week definition of the word beleaguered, and their high pressing forced Forest into goal-conceding errors.",
      "There is still a bit of huff and puff about Newcastle’s attacking play as they adapt to the post-Isak reality, but the overall picture is probably brighter than six goals and just nine points from seven league games while sitting below even Manchester United in the table might suggest.",
      "",
      "His fifth clean sheet in seven Premier League games this season (more than anyone else, unsurprisingly) was surely among the easiest of his career but welcome nonetheless after he so thoroughly spoiled a 95-minute masterclass against Arsenal with two big errors in the build-up to the Gunners’ late, late winner.",
      "",
      "The most emphatic of penalties to further cement what already appears to be the German’s assured cult hero status on Tyneside. And hopefully it invites yet more salty, salty tears from Bayern Munich, who of course for their sins have to instead watch <checks notes> Harry Kane, who has only managed to score <checks notes> <checks them again> 18 goals for them so far this season.",
      "",
      "We’re still not entirely sure which way Tottenham’s first Premier League season under Thomas Frank will eventually break. Underlying numbers hint that they are defying gravity a bit with their four wins and 14 points, but there is undeniably a new-found steel about this very work-in-progress side.",
      "The glass half-full approach to it all is that Spurs have racked up a goodly number of points despite very obviously not yet entirely working out how best to go about marrying defensive steel and long-ball football with attacking thrust and craft in the many games where they will inevitably dominate the ball and the onus is on them to take the initiative.",
      "One early quirk of the season is just how much more effective they’ve been on the road than at home. They’ve now taken 10 points from trips to Man City, West Ham, Brighton and Leeds which is clearly a return any club would settle for.",
      "It’s comfortably the best away record in the league at this time, with the only other team unbeaten away from home – Newcastle – also winless and indeed goalless away from home.",
      "And yet Spurs have managed only four points from home games against Burnley, Bournemouth and Wolves.",
      "The two conspicuously bad league performances have both come in front of their own fans, against Bournemouth and Wolves, creating a truly ludicrous state of affairs: Spurs now have as many Premier League wins in four away games this season as they’ve managed in their last 17 at home.",
      "",
      "Another quirk with Spurs is that there’s not one of their summer signings we’d put in our top 10 Premier League summer signings right now, but we also think few did better at addressing conspicuous weaknesses in the end.",
      "Joao Palhinha is precisely the player Spurs have lacked in midfield pretty much since Mousa Dembele retired, and there are already encouraging signs that he and Frank are getting some success from working out how to get him involved higher up the pitch.",
      "Xavi Simons showed some more glimpses of getting up to speed with things when finally given a proper chance in a proper No. 10 role with licence to roam wide, while Mathys Tel got a goal that could kickstart something for a player who has yet to show Spurs fans a fraction of what he’s capable of.",
      "But the closest of Spurs’ summer arrivals to serious individual praise is surely Mohammed Kudus, who is looking far more like the player we saw in his first year at West Ham than the second.",
      "Like Tel, there was an element of luck to his first goal of the season thanks to a deflection, yet like Tel he created the opportunity for luck to land on his side in a way perhaps no other player on the pitch could have done.",
      "It’s worth remembering when considering Spurs’ sometimes infuriating lack of creative flair in these early days under Frank that they are still without James Maddison and Dejan Kulusevski, either one of whom’s availability would go a long way to addressing the issues.",
      "But what they do have in Kudus is a game-changer. Nobody has more than his four Premier League assists this season, and there is already plenty of reason to think that his partnership on the right for Spurs with Pedro Porro is just getting started.",
      "",
      "A powerful example of how the Europa League group stage, so often seen as a burden and chore, can really help kick a season into life. Having failed to win any of their first five Premier League games and gone out of the Carabao on penalties at Brentford, it’s now four wins in a row for Unai Emery to change the mood at Villa Park.",
      "The first and third of those wins came in the Europa – most impressively away at Feyenoord last week – to go with a thoroughly restorative pair of home league wins over Fulham and Burnley.",
      "It’s not changed everything, and the fundamental issues behind the scenes remain ahead of a period when league games against Tottenham, Man City and Liverpool may mean even more heavy lifting is required from the Europa to keep chins up, but it all looks a lot cheerier than it did not even a fortnight ago.",
      "",
      "Had waited 15 games and 176 days to score his fourth Aston Villa goal, and then less than an hour – including half-time against Burnley – to bag his fifth.",
      "",
      "A win! A clean sheet! An international break when he definitely won’t get sacked! He probably wouldn’t have got sacked anyway, but he will surely nevertheless welcome the quiet and the chance, however brief, to allow some other clubs and managers to spend some time sweating under the harsh glare of the crisis spotlight.",
      "",
      "It wasn’t entirely down to the Belgian goalkeeper that Manchester United’s first clean sheet of the season coincided with his debut, but he did give off an air of quiet competence that has been so desperately lacking for Manchester United for so long.",
      "Here was a reminder that a calm and reassuring keeper can make a whole team appear much less jumpy.",
      "",
      "We remain unconvinced that this iteration of Man City can challenge Arsenal or Liverpool for the title, but we’re less certain about our doubts than we were after successive defeats to Tottenham and Brighton.",
      "The initially comfortable but ultimately nervy 1-0 win at Brentford on Sunday was Guardiola’s 250th league win in just 349 Premier League games. No other manager has ever got to the landmark quicker with an English top-flight club.",
      "",
      "Another goal from his Dortmund playbook, running on to Josko Gvardiol’s clipped long ball and simply barrelling Brentford’s centre-backs out of the way. He looks like an unstoppable playground bully when he plays like this and is clearly relishing City’s new-found willingness to play slightly more direct slightly more often.",
      "He also filled one of the rare gaps on his Premier League CV with a first goal at the Gtech, leaving Anfield as the only ground he’s played at in the Premier League without scoring.",
      "He now also has 94 Premier League goals – the same career total as Dimitar Berbatov. And the players he’s catching now only get more absurd in their iconic status in this league. He’s only one behind Ruud van Nistelrooy, and three behind Didier Drogba. These are absurd numbers.",
      "",
      "We are already very excited indeed for their clash with Crystal Palace in the first game back after the international break to decide which of the two officially takes on the ‘Could they really do a Leicester?’ mantle.",
      "",
      "If we cheat a bit – and we are always fans of cheating to make stats say what we want them to say – and go back to the start of May rather than the start of this season, Semenyo has now been directly involved in more goals than any other player with 12 (eight goals, four assists).",
      "Bournemouth had little choice but to cash in on their prized defensive assets, but holding firm despite widespread interest in Semenyo currently looks by far their most significant call of the summer.",
      "",
      "Rarely if ever has a man been more obviously Enjoying His Football Again than Grealish, who popped up to score a dramatic late winner for Everton against previously unbeaten Palace before delivering a joyous and joyful post-match assessment that can only really be done justice when the philosopher-poet’s musings are presented, as surely intended, in the form of verse:",

      "Easy to look at Chelsea’s squad and conclude it has simply too many half-decent tricky wide players in it to function properly.",
      "And then a whole bunch of those half-decent tricky wide players prove the difference-makers in a late-won yet fully deserved victory over the faltering champions and you wonder, not for the first time, whether Chelsea are in fact the sane ones in a world gone mad.",
      "",
      "A huge statement of a win, both for his team and Maresca personally. The vultures were circling after a stupid defeat to Manchester United and a sloppy, untidy one against Brighton.",
      "But Chelsea outplayed and outlasted the Premier League champions on Saturday evening, while Maresca got everything right including the timing and specifics of his substitutions.",
      "He’s bought himself significant time to work out how best to get this kind of output from this expensive yet sometime baffling collection of elite footballers, and that’s about as big a win as he could have hoped for this weekend.",
      "Now read all 16 Conclusions from Chelsea’s win over Liverpool, if for some inexplicable reason you are still yet to do so.",
      "",
      "Nottingham Forest weren’t even that bad in defeat at Newcastle. They kept things tight well into the second half, and when they did concede it came from a long-range Bruno Guimaraes strike rather than some structural calamity.",
      "Judging a manager a month into the job on an okay performance in defeat at a place like Newcastle would appear on the face of it a madness. But Postecoglou’s problem is that he has so thoroughly torched all semblance of goodwill in far easier games where his foibles have been more ruthlessly exposed.",
      "Nobody would be calling this result a sacking offence if he’d managed not to lose against Swansea or Sunderland or Midtjylland.",
      "But the response of the home fans at the City Ground on Thursday night was enough to tell you the manager is already on borrowed time, and that no benefit of any doubt will be granted for subsequent defeats. We can’t really think of many comparable examples of fans turning so quickly and viscerally on a manager after their appointment. They don’t expect this to get better, and in fairness to them they have a body of evidence from Postecoglou’s previous Premier League employment that is hard to argue with.",
      "Still there remains this inability to strike a balance. An inability to play compelling attacking football without fatally exposing the defence, or competent defensive football without abandoning the attack altogether. And always, always, always the apparently fundamental and unresolvable weakness from set-pieces.",
      "It’s not even that Postecoglou was wrong to set his team up to play more defensively at Newcastle; it’s just that it only further exposes the folly of making the kind of managerial change Forest made at the time they did it.",
      "",
      "Must now give serious thought to sacking a second manager this season before the leaves have finished falling from the tricky trees as they find themselves facing the troublingly real prospect of a relegation scrap of the sort they thought they had left behind.",
      "Currently existing as a reminder to the others outside the gilded elite that no matter how secure you might feel, how far those feet seem to have slid under the table, you are never more than one or two errors of judgement away from potential catastrophe.",
      "",
      "It makes no more sense to overreact to Liverpool conceding a couple of late, late winners than it did to overreact to Liverpool scoring a couple of late, late winners.",
      "It is still far too early to scream crisis about a team that remains just a point off the top of the Premier League while still attempting to bed in several new signings.",
      "Yet there is also no denying that something feels really quite wrong here. That the late winners Liverpool have scored were responsible for more masking than those they have conceded.",
      "Crystal Palace and Chelsea both played well against Liverpool and were worthy winners. But they didn’t really do anything very differently to those other teams who came close to getting something only to be denied at the last.",
      "Liverpool have not been smashed or grabbed by these late goals they’ve conceded. They’ve felt like the natural conclusion to drab and uninspired performances.",
      "And they need to find solutions fast. This is not yet a crisis, but it really does feel like it could be a crisis’ origin story. Their post-interlull fixtures are unhelpful, with league games against Manchester United, Aston Villa and Man City alongside Champions League clashes with Eintracht Frankfurt and Real Madrid plus a Carabao encounter with their newly-minted nemesis Crystal Palace all offering further obvious potential for widening of cracks and deepening of concerns.",
      "",
      "Slot is a shrewd and intelligent man so is unlikely to be shocked by any of it, but he’s been given a stark reminder of just how fragile a Premier League manager’s existence really is.",
      "A title winner in his first season and now here he is, just two weeks after leading his team to a fifth straight victory to start this season, he finds his tactics, signings, team selections and baldness all very much under the microscope while he sits alongside Scott Parker in the Sack Race betting.",
      "",
      "The numbers are… not good.",
      "",
      "We’re still very confident that this year’s crop of promoted clubs are better equipped than those of recent vintage to give us at the very, very least a proper relegation fight, but this was a chastening weekend.",
      "For the first time this season, Leeds, Sunderland and Burnley all succumbed to defeat on the same matchday and while none of the defeats against Spurs, Man United and Villa were individually disastrous it was a reminder of just what they are still up against in trying to disturb the Settled Seventeen.",
      "",
      "No need for panic, not just yet. But Fulham have just quietly got themselves in a slight tangle with back-to-back 3-1 defeats at Aston Villa and Bournemouth.",
      "With Arsenal and Newcastle to come directly after the international break, it’s a tangle that could get knottier yet.",
      "",
      "If they can’t even rely on the three banker points from a trip to the Emirates, then where exactly are they going to find the points to extricate themselves from this relegation fight? A troubling question indeed with no easy answer.",
      "",
      "Points on the board are welcome after the bleak five-game losing run to start the season, but conceding late equalisers to both Tottenham and Brighton means the recovery is far more stunted than might otherwise have been the case, while extending Wolves’ wait for a Premier League win to 11 games since the last of that dizzy run of six straight successes back in March and April.",
      "",
      "Sent off moments before Wolves’ opener against Brighton for ‘irresponsible behaviour in the technical area’ which is a simply sensational collection of words.",
      "Was he running with scissors in the technical area? Putting hot drinks on top of monitors in the technical area? Lifting heavy items unsafely in the technical area?",
      "",
      "The first player ever to be substituted in the first half of three successive Premier League starts, Odegaard hasn’t managed more than 38 minutes in any Premier League game since starting and finishing at Old Trafford on the opening weekend.",
      "A rotten run of injury luck at a particularly unhelpful time for a player who has more competition than ever for his place in Arsenal’s starting XI.",
      "",
      "We’re really not sure winning games is currently in the long-term interests of Manchester United Football Club. At least not until Ruben Amorim can prove he actually can do it twice in a row.",
      "Liverpool away next. No pressure, Ruben.",
      "Ruben Amorim has barely survived one international break but could fall into the trap of another, with Sir Jim Ratcliffe minded to follow Daniel Levy.",
      "The question with Manchester United is not ‘are they in a crisis?’ but ‘how do they stop being in a crisis?’ And we really don’t know if there’s an answer.",
      "Gary Neville likely knew the reaction his comments would evoke, but did he know the furore ‘won’t stop until he’s taken off Sky and his Overlap podcast’?",
      "Manchester United have been ‘not good’ and ’embarrassing at times’ but the Ruben Amorim sack calls continue because of one game – and his ‘ridiculous’ subs.",
      "Aleksander Ceferin and UEFA *have* set a precedent allowing domestic league games to be played overseas. Claiming otherwise is disingenuous."

      "Manchester United made it three wins in a row at Old Trafford as they eased the pressure on Ruben Amorim with a 2-0 win over Sunderland.",
      "Mason Mount, selected ahead of Matheus Cunha, scored a fine opening goal before Benjamin Sesko netted at Old Trafford for the first time in front of his home supporters. Sunderland struggled to cope and even switched to 3-4-3 in a bid to alter the flow.",
      "There were flashes from Regis Le Bris' side that hinted at their confident start to the campaign, Bertrand Traore almost opening the scoring and Granit Xhaka firing off a shot. They also thought they had a penalty against Sesko but VAR rightly overruled it.",
      "Man Utd: Lammens (7), Shaw (6), De Ligt (7), Yoro (6), Dalot (7), Amad (7), Casemiro (6), Fernandes (7), Mount (8), Mbeumo (7), Sesko (8).\n\n\nSubs: Dorgu (6), Cunha (6), Mainoo (6), Ugarte (n/a), Maguire (n/a).\n\n\nSunderland: Roefs (7), Hume (5), Mukiele (6), Alderete (5), Masuaku (6), Xhaka (7), Sadiki (6), Le Fee (6), Traore (5), Adingra (6), Isidor (6).\n\n\nSubs: Ballard (6), Mayenda (5), Talbi (6), Brobbey (6), Geertruida (7).\n\n\nPlayer of the Match: Mason Mount.",
      "But United were the better side and could have punished the visitors even more but for Robin Roefs pulling off some good saves, including a fingertip effort to deny Bruno Fernandes. Senne Lammens, making his United debut, was less busy at the other end.",
      "Mason Mount's opener for Manchester United against Sunderland rounded off an 18-pass move, the joint-most for a goal in the Premier League this season.",
      "Lammens' best save came late in the game when he kept out a Chemsdine Talbi effort with his legs but the Belgian goalkeeper was hardly overworked. There were bigger cheers when he claimed a cross in stoppage time, his second good claim of the game.",
      "Manchester United kept their first clean sheet of the season in what was also Senne Lammens' debut for the club.",
      "How United need that sort of commanding presence in goal with supporters unconvinced by the performances of Altay Bayindir. Lammens, signed from Antwerp late in the window, also looked composed when kicking with his right and left foot.",
      "There was one hairy moment when he chased out of his goal on the angle only to see Traore get there first amid some uncertainty with Fernandes. But as debuts go, this was a fine effort from a 23-year-old goalkeeper with a huge task ahead of him.",
      "Manchester United head coach Ruben Amorim in the press conference:",
      "\"I think he looked confident in the first game. But the important thing is that the teammates helped Senne to have a good game. Because everyone was focused, not a lot of mistakes against a team that was really comfortable playing football.\"",
      "Asked why he delayed starting him, Amorim added: \"He arrives and you can feel it that he needs to adapt. New country, new training, the pressure that you guys put on the goalkeepers are massive. So it was like a little preparation for the guy to be ready to start his first game.",
      "\"But now it's just one game and he needs to work. Because he needs to be prepared that in our club things are really hard. But he did well in the game. He was comfortable during the game and that is a very good sign.\"",
      "Asked whether the international break denies United the opportunity to build momentum, Amorim joked that \"there is no momentum with our team\" - a reference to the fact that they are still looking for back-to-back Premier League wins under him.",
      "But Amorim was encouraged by the performance. When asked about Mount's comments that the players were 100 per cent behind their coach, the Portuguese suggested that the performance was proof of that.",
      "\"I saw it today. And I know they want to do the best and I know they don't want to change the coach all the time.",
      "\"We need to show with actions. Sometimes when we look at our team, I know for sure that when we see the games in the end I know sometimes we can do better. I feel it during the week but we need to show it on the pitch.\"",
      "It is easy to talk about heart, about shape, about defending with your lives - something which has provided the platform for some impressive results for Sunderland against Crystal Palace and Nottingham Forest. But resolve only gets you so far.",
      "At some point, you have to hurt teams and possess quality in the final third. And at Old Trafford, Sunderland looked woefully short in that department, creating just 0.71 worth of expected goals and rarely testing Lammens, who would have been feeling it ahead of his United debut.",
      "And while it's fair to say United were efficient rather than exceptional once racing into their 2-0, the gap in quality was undeniable. This was a bit of a reality check. A performance that strips back the optimism and lays bare the challenge ahead of survival.",

      "\"So it's not three centre-backs, it's the same thing with a little bit different positions. Against Brentford, second half, it was like a 4-4-2. The problem is that we were not good with the ball, we were soft without the ball and we lose.",

      "Gary Neville has delivered his most damning verdict on Ruben Amorim's Manchester United yet as the under-pressure Portuguese coach readies for a crunch clash against Sunderland this weekend.",
      "Amorim fell to another sobering defeat as a rampant Brentford beat United 3-1 at the Gtech last weekend.",
      "It denied Amorim the chance to end a dismal record of failing to secure back-to-back league games in the same season since May 2024. United now sit in 14th, having lost three games this season, losing two and drawing one of their six fixtures, which has prompted huge concerns for Neville.",
      "\"I'm very worried,\" Neville told NBC, Sky's US partner, following the 3-1 defeat at Brentford. \"There's no point in me sitting here and saying that I'm not.",
      "\"The levels of performance, the results, the substitutions...[at Brentford], I saw something [which happened] at the end of the Grimsby game that they lost in the Carabao Cup a couple of weeks ago, which was Mason Mount ending up at left wing back.",
      "\"Now, look, we admire managers who are resilient, who are stubborn around the system. We want them to stick to the plan.",
      "\"But when you've got Mason Mount playing at left wing-back, you're going to look pretty stupid. And that's happened twice now. It can't happen. The first time I thought was unforgivable and it's happened again.",
      "\"He changes his back three and his back five every single game. And the performances and the results are just unacceptable. So I'm really, really worried.",
      "\"I would never go on television - I know how difficult a manager's job can be - and say that a manager should be sacked. But I suspect that the hierarchy at Manchester United are going to want to see a turnaround very quickly.\"",
      "Neville: \"When you've got Mason Mount playing at left wing-back, you're going to look pretty stupid.\"",
      "What the stats say: A manager's substitutions are meant to help a team, but Ruben Amorim's in-game changes at Manchester United have so far proven to be more of a hindrance. His Premier League substitutes have made more errors leading to goals than they have scored goals.",
      "That is as damning as stats come for a coach. The tally stands at 3-2 since he took charge nearly 11 months ago. In six games this season, two of Amorim's substitutes have made errors leading to a goal and none have scored off the bench.",
      "Neville: \"The results are just unacceptable.\"",
      "What the stats say: Results have been bad ever since Amorim arrived, so it is difficult to tell what it would take for the situation to become intolerable for the decision-makers at Old Trafford.",
      "Graham Potter was sacked by West Ham last weekend with a win percentage of 26.1 in the Premier League. Amorim's stands at 27.27 per cent after 33 games.",
      "For context, that is identical to Chris Wilder's record at Sheffield United in the top-flight after 66 games.",
      "Steve Bruce had a marginally better win rate when he was sacked by Newcastle, and so did Gary O'Neil at Wolves. This is the ballpark Amorim is in.",
      "Compared to coaches at 'Big Six' clubs since that moniker came into being in the early 2010s, Amorim has the worst Premier League record of those with at least 30 games. Juande Ramos was not much better at Spurs (28.6 per cent), but the 'Big Six' didn't exist then.",
      "Neville: \"He changes his back three and his back five every single game.\"",
      "What the stats say: Amorim has used 21 different back threes in his 33 Premier League games at United, which is by far and away the most of any other side in the competition during that timeframe. Southampton (13) and Wolves (10) are the closest behind.",
      "A change to the back three worked against Amorim last time out, with Harry Maguire starting in the back three for the first time in the league last season and playing a part in the first goal United conceded.",
      "Tinkering with his back line appears to be a consistent theme under Amorim. Leny Yoro, who started each of United's first four league games of the season, hasn't started since but has been introduced in the last two. Matthijs de Ligt and Luke Shaw have both started all of United's league games so far. However, Shaw has only completed 90 minutes in three of those games.",
      "The lack of consistency at the back of United has proved to be a reflection of their lack of consistency in both results and performances."

      "\"It's not that hard [to block the noise out], obviously, the main thing we see is on social media, so it's just not going on there much, and you just have to stay focused on your own things.\"",
      "For all of the negativity that seems to surround Man Utd at this present time, there was a moment at the weekend that Amorim and United fans had been waiting for.",

      "\"Of course it will improve, we haven't played a lot together, so there are certain things that we're going to improve, and there are different types of players, but it's good to be with them.\"",
      "One of Mbeumo's other team-mates is Bruno Fernandes, who has had a rollercoaster of a season himself.",

      "VAR: Any contact there, any contact after that is normal contact, because the goalkeeper just plays his foot.",
      "REF: Can you play it at full speed?",
      "VAR: Playing at normal speed for you.",
      "REF: So I'm seeing the goalkeeper get a toe to the ball first, prior to making contact.",
      "VAR: Agree.",
      "REF: So after a view, the goalkeeper plays the ball, there's no foul. Final decision, we drop ball.",
      "VAR: Confirmed.",
      "\"At full speed, it looks a penalty, doesn't it? And you can absolutely understand why the referee gave it from what he saw on the field.",
      "\"He gave it for a tripping action by Nick Pope. The VAR checks the penalty. Obviously, it's a reviewable situation, penalties, goals, etc.",
      "\"So he checks the penalty, makes sure that the decision is not clearly wrong. When he does that, he clearly sees that Gyokeres gets to the ball, pokes it a little bit forward, but then, importantly, Nick Pope also gets a very clear touch on the ball as he steps forward with that right foot and deviates the direction that the ball is going.",
      "\"And that hadn't been appreciated on the field by the referee. Pope then plants his foot on the ground. He doesn't drive it forward into Gyokeres.",
      "\"There's a gap, clearly a gap, between the two players after Pope has played the ball, and then the two players come together quite normally. The action by Pope is normal. It's not reckless. It's just a kick out towards the ball. The ball deviates.",
      "\"No contact on the player until the ball has been played away, and then the contact happens fairly normally. So, not a foul, and therefore a good use of the VAR to intervene to show the referee what really happened.",
      "\"The deviation's quite clear. You'll see that touch by Gyokeres, and you'll see Pope's right leg come in. It touches the ball, it moves the ball away in a different direction to the direction it was previously going in.",
      "\"When he then puts his foot on the ground, having made contact with the ball, there's a separation between him and Gyokeres. There's no contact at that point. The contact only happens after Pope has played the ball.",
      "\"So, it's a good challenge by Pope. It's not a foul, and there was an important part around this in that the referee didn't recognise that touch by Pope in real time.",
      "\"Hence the reason that when the VAR saw it, he deemed it to be a clear and obvious error because that touch by Pope hadn't been seen, and therefore the referee could go to the screen to look at that really important aspect and make a judgement for himself, and the judgement was: I've seen the touch, therefore it's not a foul, and I'm going to start with the drop ball.",
      "\"The referee hadn't recognised that touch, that was important, the VAR saw it and deemed it was a clear error. I agree with the VAR's intervention, so the referee can go to the screen, look at the full sequence, see that touch, see that there was a normal playing action by Pope and the penalty was rightly cancelled.\"",
      "A similar scenario happened during Manchester United's 2-1 win over Chelsea. Early on in the game, an onrushing Sanchez hacked down Bryan Mbeumo just outside the area and was subsequently sent off for denying a clear goalscoring opportunity.",
      "Webb's verdict:",
      "\"I know people have compared the two situations. I think they're really quite different, and we'll talk about why.",
      "\"I think the only similarity is that there is a touch on the ball from the goalkeeper in both situations, but the way that touch happens is quite different.",
      "\"Now, in this situation, Sanchez was sent off for denying Mbeumo an obvious goalscoring opportunity. He committed a foul, which prevented Mbeumo from continuing through to try to score.",
      "\"When you see the way that Sanchez comes out to try to play that ball, whereas we saw Pope play the ball low, his foot went straight to ground, and then there was a normal coming together.",
      "\"In this situation, he leads with a raised leg and stud showing, which goes into the leg of Mbeumo. It's at least a reckless action. Some people have talked about it, maybe even being more serious foul play, endangering the safety of the opponent.",
      "\"I think it's reckless, at least. It has to be penalised. There is that small touch on the ball, but that doesn't negate the fact you have to penalise this sort of action.",
      "\"And that touch, by the way, is quite different to the Pope one in that the ball doesn't really deviate, it just continues.",
      "\"It touches the top of the boot of Sanchez, and then continues in the same line with Mbeumo about to run onto it. In Pope's situation, we saw quite a deviation of that ball.",
      "\"So, for all of those reasons, this is absolutely something we have to penalise, primarily, though, because of the nature of the way that Sanchez went in, stood exposed on to the leg of Mbeumo.",
      "\"It has to be a foul. And then, of course, we know that the conditions are there for an obvious goalscoring opportunity.",
      "\"Mbeumo running on to that ball, the defenders are not there to cover. It's obviously a goalscoring opportunity. And therefore, the red card comes out for that reason.\"",
