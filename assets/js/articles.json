      "Manchester United legend Roy Keane scoffed at Thierry Henry's claim that former Arsenal and Chelsea man Ashley Cole is the best left-back he has seen. Henry insisted that the ex-England defender doesn't get the credit he deserves on the back of his unceremonious move to Stamford Bridge.",
      "Hale End graduate Cole began his Gunners career in 1999 when he made his full debut, and would go on to establish himself under Arsene Wenger as one of the Premier League's finest full-backs. The Englishman won two league titles in north London as well as three FA Cup trophies, and was pivotal in the club's famous 2003/04 Invincibles campaign.",
      "While Cole, who played over 200 times for Arsenal, saw his Gunners legacy somewhat tarnished in 2006 when he joined bitter rivals Chelsea in an acrimonious switch, Henry believes he still doesn't get the recognition he deserves as one of English football's finest ever left-backs. Though Red Devils legend Keane slightly disagrees.",
      "\"There is a guy that I want to talk about, who I don't understand why in this country he doesn't get his respect: Ashley Cole,\" Henry stated on the Stick to Football podcast. \"Ashley Cole was outstanding.",
      "\"Firstly, in 2000, Ashley went to Crystal Palace on loan, and he saved them from relegation, playing as a winger. When you have a left-back that can dribble past their winger, he was the one who created space for the rest of the team at Arsenal. He started everything.",
      "\"For me, Ashley Cole is the best left-back I have ever seen. Me. I'm not talking about everybody. Ashley Cole… Going forward, defending, the desire, what he won and why he won it.\"",
      "While Henry sang the praises of his former team-mate, who he played alongside a staggering 195 times in the red of Arsenal, Keane then chimed in. \"I think he was a brilliant player, but when you talk about great left-backs, he doesn't spring to my mind,\" quipped Keane. \"Of course, he was a brilliant player.\"",
      "Henry rebuked Keane's claim and went on to discuss Cole's controversial and bad-blooded move from the north of London to the west, explaining he feels it is why the left-back isn't quite held in the regard he deserves. He continued: \"Ashley Cole is an Arsenal man.",
      "\"His whole family supports Arsenal. But I can understand why he left at the time. In 2005, David Dein shook hands on a deal, but he came back with something else.",
      "\"With Ashley moving to Chelsea, people don't give him the respect he deserves for everything that he has done. But for me, Cole was outstanding.\"",
      "Former Arsenal vice-chairman Dein oversaw plenty of successes during his 24 years in the role, but he previously admitted that letting the left-back leave was one of his biggest regrets before stepping down in 2007.",
      "Cole was offered a hefty pay rise by Stamford Bridge chiefs and he went on to enjoy a fruitful eight-year spell with the club, winning one league title, a Champions League, Europa League, League Cup, Community Shield and four FA Cups. He's considered very much in the debate of the greatest left-backs of all time alongside the likes of Roberto Carlos, Marcelo and Paolo Maldini.",

      "Kone was introduced in the 32nd minute for Casemiro in the 1-0 loss to Asean All Stars before being hooked again for Toby Collyer at half time. Amorim used a similar tactic against Hong Kong to stagger his game time, bringing him on in the 27th minute before subbing him again at the interval, with Manuel Ugarte replacing him.",
      "Kone has also been named on the bench by Amorim on a handful of occasions in the Premier League against Tottenham in February and against Everton and Forest.",

      "He played nine times in the Premier League 2 for United's youth team, scoring once. His Under-21 coach Travis Binnion recently commented on his progress, admitting he struggled for fitness at first but is now at the level where he can play a string of games each week.",
      "Binnion admitted Kone still had \"a long way to go\" before he was ready for first team action under Amorim but remained upbeat over his future prospects.",
      "\"We have a long way to go,\" he told MEN in April. \"He broke down at Huddersfield, whereas now he can get through three games in a week. At the next level, first-team level, he wouldn’t be able to because he’s not quite there yet, but his decision-making will make that easier for him physically.",
      "\"If he’s not in the right position or he makes the wrong decision, the game then opens up and it’s harder to be consistently in the right positions. It’s a long-term project with him, but his ability is there for all to see.",
      "\"I think the position he plays in on the pitch requires a lot of discipline, and we’re working on that discipline and decision-making. He is a really good player, but you can see tonight he’s had three, four or five shots and it’s like, there aren’t too many No.6s who are getting into the areas he is.",
      "\"You don’t want to stifle that completely, but if he’s not in the right area of the pitch, then it’s harder for the team to function and it’s harder for him to develop, so he’s working really hard through training and language support.\"",

      "Bryan Mbeumo stands on the brink of the biggest summer of his career as Manchester United chase his signature – but the Brentford star is no stranger to making big decisions. The 25-year-old forward is poised to move in the summer transfer window after enjoying a stand-out season that has thrust him into the spotlight.",
      "Mbeumo racked up 20 goals and eight assists in 38 Premier League matches for Brentford this season and was one of the league’s stand-out players. He has been linked with Newcastle, Liverpool and Tottenham, but it is Manchester United who are understood to be the most keen on the £50million-rated forward.",
      "The Bees star is keen to play European football – a factor that could count against United – after working his way into the top tier of Premier League forwards. Mbeumo has been at Brentford for six years, having joined from French side Troyes when they were in the Championship.",
      "His form for Brentford has earned admiring glances before – and just not from rival clubs. Back in the summer of 2022 it was legendary former Barcelona and Inter Milan striker Samuel Eto’o who was keeping an eye on him in his role as president of the Cameroon Football Federation.",
      "Mbeumo was born in France and played for Les Bleus’ from under-17 to under-21 level, but never received a senior call-up. His dad is from Cameroon and Eto’o came to see Mbeumo with a proposal ahead of the 2022 World Cup.",
      "“It was just the two of us, I met him in a restaurant,” Mbeumo told the Brentford club website back in November 2022. “He came to London to see me. I know from my dad, who’s Cameroonian, that it could be a good opportunity.",
      "“When he approached me in the first place, I didn’t know if I would go or not. But after speaking to him, he explained to me about the project and I was happy with it. Afterwards, he gave me a bit of time to think about it before I gave my decision, and then I decided to play for them.",
      "“I was a bit nervous to meet him! He’s a legend of African football and football in general. I also asked him questions about being a striker, how he did certain things, how he dealt with certain situations, and he gave me advice. Talking about football with him was great.”",
      "He added: “I’m very proud for me and my family to represent the country. My dad was very happy – I also did this for him. I knew how proud he would be and he felt amazing after I made my debut and played those two games.”",
      "Mbeumo now has 22 caps and six goals for Cameroon and is hoping to take the next step in his club career this summer. While he wants to keep hold of him, Brentford manager Thomas Frank knows his star player is capable of taking a step up – even if it is to a team, like United, who finished five places lower this season.",
      "“I always knew he was a goalscorer. Now he’s now just a more consistent goalscorer. His hold-up play is even better, his assist play or link-up play, his work ethic is fantastic. So very impressed.”",

      "Bryan Mbeumo will give Manchester United something they are sorely lacking, according to Brentford boss Thomas Frank. The Cameroon star has been identified by United as their next priority signing after tying up a deal for Matheus Cunha from Wolves.",
      "Amid interest from Arsenal and Newcastle, Mbeumo has indicated his desire to join the Red Devils, despite their torrid Premier League campaign and missing out on European football. A deal to sign Mbeumo is not yet done, with the 25-year-old believed to be demanding a £250,000-per-week deal.",
      "But if United do get their man, he will not just sharpen up their forward line but provide the leadership the team has been lacking in recent seasons, says his current manager, Frank. Captain Bruno Fernandes and Harry Maguire are widely regarded as United's only ‘leaders’ amid widespread attitude concerns within the squad.",
      "That trait persuaded United to extend the often-maligned Maguire’s contract to the summer of 2026. His deal was originally due to expire this summer.",
      "Speaking in January, head coach Ruben Amorim said: “When you look at our team, we are starving for leaders on the pitch. He [Maguire] is a leader. He has to improve that part and he has to improve our game. We are happy to continue with him.\"",
      "According to Frank, Mbeumo, who arrived in west London from French side Troyes in 2019, offers leadership as well as goals. Speaking in 2023, the Danish coach said following a win over West Ham: “I praised him a couple of weeks ago because he drives training with his attitude and work ethic and determination to want to get better and win.\" Frank then pointedly added: “He’s definitely a leader in the making.”",
      "United have already made one move in the transfer market this summer by signing Brazil forward Cunha. Departures could include Jadon Sancho, although Chelsea, where he spent last season on loan, are prepared to pay a £5million penalty fee to escape an obligation to make his current loan permanent.",
      "Seemingly in anticipation of his Stamford Bridge exit, Sancho posted on X on Tuesday night: “Grateful for the experience. Big love to everyone at Chelsea who made me feel at home - team-mates, staff and the fans. Wishing the club all the best moving forward. Truly grateful, thank you Blues.”",
      "One player who won't be going anywhere, it seems, is Fernandes, who has turned down a mega-money deal to join Saudi Pro League side Al Hilal, who were reportedly prepared to pay him £700,000 per week. Fernandes confirmed he had rejected the chance to move after speaking to Amorim and his family.",
      "“The president of Al Hilal called me a month ago to ask about the possibility of me moving there,” Fernandes told a Portugal press conference, according to Portuguese outlet O Jogo.",
      "“I had to wait a while to think about the future. As I’ve always said, I would be willing to do it if United thought it was best to move on.",
      "“I spoke with Ruben Amorim, who really tried to talk me out of it. I spoke to the club, who said they weren’t willing to sell me, only if I wanted to leave.”"

      "The leaked home shirt looks pretty straightforward: a red number with black and white touches, while the away shirt is a bold all-white effort.",

      "United begin their pre-season against Leeds in Stockholm on July 19 before flying over to the Untied States for games against West Ham, Bournemouth and Everton. They then return to Old Trafford to play Fiorentina on August 9 before the Premier League begins again on August 16.",
      "What’s for certain is that it will be a dramatically different United squad next season, with the club overhauling things in the transfer window.

      "Sources close to the Magpies insist he'll be getting paid well above their pay scale by choosing not to join their European fight next term, but they weren't interested in breaking their salary structure. Mbeumo earns a basic £45k-a-week at Brentford and is looking to earn four or five times that amount.",
      "United still need to negotiate a transfer fee with Brentford but that isn't expected to be a problem.",
      "The Bees business model means they are happy to cash in on their prized asset while his stock is at an all-time high - taking the cash and putting it towards the next young stars who will look to make a splash at the Gtech Community Stadium before inevitably being sold on for big profit.",

The Reds will aim to defend their 20th league title in 2025/26 following Arne Slot’s successful debut campaign and Gerrard has named the sides to worry about.",
      "Liverpool finished 10 points clear of Arsenal this season, securing their first title since 2020 with a thumping win over Tottenham on April 27. They boasted the league’s best attack – thanks largely to top-scorer Mohamed Salah, who managed 29 goals himself – and the second-best defence.",

Slot will have the summer to build a new squad, but former Liverpool captain Gerrard is expecting tougher opposition next season.",
      "\"Liverpool will be well aware that they're going to be the ones that are hunted now. But evidence suggests that Liverpool are going to be strong in the transfer market, so Liverpool are the team to catch for sure.\"",
      "City rallied to finish third in the Premier League, just three points behind Arsenal – who finished second for the third straight year – but saw their title chances evaporate early in the season. However, Pep Guardiola has signed a new contract and City will have key Ballon d’Or-winning midfielder Rodri back available for the start of the next campaign.",
      "Gerrard added: \"I think you've got to be wary of City and Guardiola. The best manager in the world. They've done it four years on the spin, they lost Rodri, which was a big blow to them.",

      "United finished 15th in Ruben Amorim’s debut season and their defeat in the Europa League final against Tottenham means they won’t play any European football next season. They will undergo the biggest squad overhaul of all Premier League clubs this summer, with Matheus Cunha expected to be the first of many arrivals once his £62.5million deal goes through.",

Donnarumma, 26, helped PSG win the Champions League final on Saturday, although he had little to do as they hammered Inter Milan 5-0 in Munich.",
      "It's the second time that the former AC Milan star has been a champion of a Europe, having been the hero for Italy at Euro 2020 with two penalty saves in the final against England. PSG signed him that summer on a five-year deal, having left Milan in acrimonious circumferences.",
      "That contract expires in June 2026 and it was reported this week that United are among the clubs monitoring his situation. Red Devils boss Ruben Amorim would like to sign a new goalkeeper amid concerns over Andre Onana but Old Trafford chiefs aren't planning to spend big unless their current first-choice shot-stopper decides to leave.",
      "Napoli were also claimed to be interested in Donnarumma but his agent, Enzo Raiola - cousin of the late super agent, Mino - says that talk a move to the Serie A winners is 'pure fantasy'. Instead, they're in talks with PSG over extending his stay in Paris.",
      "\"It's pure fantasy. I've an excellent relationship with Director Giovanni Manna at [Napoli], but we've never discussed Gigio,\" Raiola told Radio CRC via Calciomercato.",
      "\"It's an obvious question; many would like him, but only a few can afford him. He feels good in Paris, we're at the European champion club, so we have no complaints. We are working on a renewal [with PSG].\"",
      "Raiola hasn't ruled out a move to Napoli in the future, though, as Donnarumma is from Castellammare, a town in the Metropolitan City of Naples. \"His mother is a huge Napoli fan, and she gets anxious watching their games. Gigio is connected to that,\" his representative continued.",
      "Which goalkeeper should Manchester United sign instead? Let us know your choice in the comments section.",
      "\"He grew up as a Milan supporter, watching his older brothers in a Rossoneri shirt, but he never denied his roots. In fact, his first stop during the holidays is always Castellammare.\"",
      "Donnarumma's performances dipped in the early part of the season before he and his team-mates clicked into gear after the winter break, going on to win the treble. His saves against Premier League trio Liverpool, Aston Villa and Arsenal during the Champions League knockout phase were vital to Luis Enrique's all-conquering side."

      "Negotiations between United and Brentford are expected to kick off soon, with Mbeumo's impressive tally of 20 goals and seven assists in 38 league matches this season putting his value at about £60million.",

The winger's keen eye for finding the net and his pace along the frontline are much needed at United, and were instrumental in Brentford securing their 10th place standing this season.",

      "Bryan Mbeumo is said to have told Manchester United he wants to more than quadruple his wages to £250,000-a-week if he is to move to Old Trafford this summer.",
      "The Cameroon star, 25, has been identified by United as their next priority signing after concluding a deal for Matheus Cunha from Wolves. And despite interest from elsewhere in the form of Arsenal and Newcastle, Mbeumo has indicated his preference would be to join the Red Devils.",
      "Mbeumo is coming off the back of a standout season for Brentford after breaking the 20 goal barrier in the Premier League for the first time.",
      "United are set to approach Brentford imminently to try and thrash out a deal for the versatile forward, who is valued by the Londoners in excess of £60million. But Mbeumo's desire for a significant salary increase means the overall package of a deal for the Bees talisman will not be cheap.",
      "As first revealed by The Times, Mbeumo currently earns £50,000-a-week at Brentford; he's looking to increase that FIVE-FOLD should he move to Old Trafford.",
      "If United agreed to said demands, them Mbeumo would instantly become one of the club's highest earners during a transfer window where the Red Devils are looking to offload two of their most handsomely paid players in Marcus Rashford and Jadon Sancho.",
      "Mbeumo is in the final year of his deal in west London and, while the club do hold an option, there is an acceptance at Brentford that he is likely to move on after another stellar season in red and white.",
      "Like Cunha, Mbeumo would arrive at United as an oven ready addition to Ruben Amorim's beleaguered squad given he is an established Premier League player. United finished 15th in the league last year and, as such, are planning for a major squad overhaul.",
      "Mbeumo's goal tally last season was among the best in the league with only Mo Salah, Erling Haaland and Alexander Isak bettering his 20 strikes. To put those returns into context, Bruno Fernandes and Amad were United's joint-top scorers in the Premier League last season with eight goals.",
      "While Brentford are open to cashing in on Mbeumo this summer, Thomas Frank, the Bees' head coach, has already stressed that their star forward will not leave on the cheap.",
      "“It is clear that if he is to be sold, it must be for a nice, nice amount,” Frank said recently. “It is a lot. Mucho. Really a lot. How many wingers score 20 goals for a mid-table club? And then with seven assists plus his work ethic. And his character. All these things mean that he has a lot, so he is a good player.”",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more."

Sancho spent the season on loan at Stamford Bride and the Blues were obligated to make the deal permanent after finishing higher than 14th in the Premier League.",

The Red Devils are preparing for a big summer in the transfer market as Ruben Amorim looks to overhaul his struggling squad that finished 15th in the Premier League.",

      "Ruben Amorim named Kone in the squad for the post-season tour in Malaysia and Hong Kong.",
      "The 19-year-old was introduced at half-time in both games against ASEAN All-Stars and Hong Kong, and he was included in a handful of matchday squads in the Premier League this season.",
      "Kone made the first-team bench for the first time against Tottenham in February. He was also named on the bench at Goodison Park and against Nottingham Forest at Old Trafford.",
      "United paid around £1million to sign Kone from Malian club Guidars FC last summer and sources preached patience when he touched down in England, saying he would need time to adapt to his new surroundings.",
      "Kone essentially had his own pre-season after missing a lot of time training while the transfer process went on, which explained why he only made his first academy start in November.",
      "And Kone picked up an injury when he made his first Under-21 start against Huddersfield's senior team. He struggled with the physicality of the match and limped off before half-time.",
      "The Malian missed a few weeks of action, but he ended the season by delivering strong displays in academy fixtures and he is seen as a youngster with first-team potential.",
      "Kone began English lessons immediately after his arrival, but Travis Binnion (Under-21 manager), Dave Hughes (former assistant), and Tommy Rowe (player-coach) also took French lessons to communicate with him.",

      "United are interested in signing the 25-year-old attacker and are keen to bring him to M16. He scored 20 Premier League goals this season, meaning he would be another statement addition.",

      "As a result of missing out on European qualification, United do not have as big a transfer budget as they would have done had they qualified for Europe's premier club competition. It means they will have to box clever with elements of their recruitment this summer.",
      "But having already signed Cunha and now targeting Mbeumo, it has quickly become clear that United are in no mood to hang around. They want their business done as quickly as possible.",
      "Should United sign Mbeumo, the expectation is he will occupy the right-sided No.10 berth. Cunha has been signed to operate in the left-sided playmaker spot.",
      "As far as United's attack is concerned, that just leaves the No.9 position in need of a fresh face. United desperately need to sign a striker this summer and their hopes of signing Liam Delap from Ipswich Town are now dead in the water after he chose a move to Chelsea.",
      "It remains to be seen which direction United's striker search will now head in, but there are a handful of obvious candidates the club could turn to in their hunt for a chief goal-getter. Few are more appealing than Napoli striker Victor Osimhen.",
      "The Nigerian international, 26, has made a name for himself after becoming one of Europe's most prolific strikers in recent years. In the last three seasons alone, he has scored 85 goals.",
      "Osimhen spent this season on loan at Turkish club Galatasaray, scoring 37 times in 41 games, after falling out with Napoli head coach Antonio Conte last summer. Conte later admitted a permanent exit for the striker would have been \"better\".",
      "Napoli are keen to offload him on a permanent basis this summer and director Giovanni Manna, in February, confirmed the Italian club wants the striker's future resolved as quickly as possible.",
      "\"Victor is always going to be a hotly-debated topic and not just on the transfer market,\" Manna told Sky Sport Italia.",
      "\"He is an appetising player for clubs, he has a clause and everyone knows this, we are working to find a solution as quickly as possible, so that we can avoid what happened last year.\"",
      "Keen to offload him as quickly as possible, Napoli are unlikely to dig their heels in. It is understood his release clause is valued at £64million, meaning it is an attractive price for a striker so reliable in front of goal.",
      "United, though, do not have a bottomless pit of money this summer, meaning the prospect of them adding Osimhen and Mbeumo to the addition of Cunha without cutting their cloth is fanciful. They need to raise funds via player sales and they are eager to sell Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho, Alejandro Garnacho and Antony to name just a few.",
      "However, with Napoli eager to resolve Osimhen's future as quickly as possible, it puts pressure on United to shift their wantaway players just as fast. The window will temporarily close again next week before reopening on June 16.",
      "United, if they sell the likes of Rashford and Garnacho, will be hoping to bank around £80m as a minimum, meaning they have assets that can be sold to fund a deal for Osimhen, who has previously admitted playing in the Premier League is his \"dream\".",
      "Previously, a move for Osimhen would have been considered impossible amid the fact United cannot offer any form of European football for next season. The events of the last few days, however, have proven they still remain an enormous attraction."

      "The worst was feared when Martinez fell to the ground against Crystal Palace in February, as his knee buckled as he landed and he looked distraught as he was stretched off the pitch.",
      "The bad news was subsequently confirmed: Martinez tore the cruciate ligament in his knee. United did not communicate a timeline on when he could return, but Martinez was expected to face a lengthy spell of between six and nine months on the sidelines, depending on how his rehabilitation progressed.",
      "Martinez suffered the knee injury at the beginning of February and four months have passed, so it would probably be a stretch to expect him to feature during pre-season games in July.",
      "The beginning of August could be a possible return date for Martinez, though, at least to be working on grass, which suggests he could be available for selection shortly after the new season begins.",
      "United will not rush Martinez back to prevent aggravating the injury, but August seems a realistic target for him to work toward and a September return might even be in the back of his mind.",
      "It's common for players with serious injuries to set provisional dates to target their return so they can be motivated during the rehabilitation process, which can be mentally challenging.",
      "Martinez was spotted on a handful of matchdays at the end of the campaign. The 27-year-old joined the celebrations after beating Athletic Bilbao at Old Trafford and he arrived with the squad, wearing a Paul Smith club suit, at the Estadio de San Mames for the Europa League final against Tottenham.",

      "The Argentina international was previously considered undroppable. He was one of the first names on the team sheet. However, Martinez will not go immediately back into the starting XI when he gets back up to speed following his lay-off.",
      "It goes without saying that a player returning from a serious injury wouldn't start straight away, but Martinez will be forced to fight for his place when he's considered 100 per cent fit.",
      "Martinez's performances were mixed this term and some displays were a far cry from those he produced in his first season in Manchester, which earned him popularity among fans.",
      "Ruben Amorim did not consider dropping Martinez because he was the only left-footed centre-back in the squad. But everything changed when Ayden Heaven was signed in January and, more importantly, when Amorim experimented by starting Leny Yoro on the left side of the defensive trio.",
      "Yoro has been excellent since his relocation to the left. The Frenchman grew in confidence with each month during his first season and he ended the campaign strongly in that role.",
      "The 19-year-old will be nailed on to start in that position on the opening day of the new season and it will be fascinating to see whether Martinez can win that role back, provided each defensive option is fit.",
      "Martinez has gone from having no competition for his role to having Yoro and Heaven breathing down his neck, which should help him raise his level when he returns from his knee injury.",
      "There is finally competition for the left-sided centre-back role in Amorim's system."

      "Cunha is expected to play as a No. 10, having operated in that position in the same system as Amorim plays at Wolves, and while Mbeumo can also operate as a No. 10 and bring a left-footed option, he could also fill the centre-forward role. United could also look to sign another striker, especially if Hojlund or Zirkzee depart.",

      "Hello and welcome back to the Manchester United transfer blog on Wednesday, June 4.",
      "This week has been dominated by Bruno Fernandes' future and the uncertainty surrounding that following interest from Saudi Arabia giants Al-Hilal.",
      "However, news emerged that the Portuguese had turned down an approach from the Gulf, in order to achieve success in Europe. The deal was said to be in the region of £100million but speaking during Tuesday's press conference, the 30-year-old emphasised his intent to continue at the top level.",
      "United are also pushing ahead with their interest in Brentford star Bryan Mbeumo. Already, Ruben Amorim has welcomed Matheus Cunha into the fold as they look to bolster their ranks in a bid to surge up the table.",
      "But there are also some key outgoings to deal with at Old Trafford. Yesterday, it was confirmed that Chelsea would be buying out of their loan agreement for Jadon Sancho, meaning he will now return to United ahead of a possible summer exit.",
      "There are also question marks over Marcus Rashford and Antony, who both spent the remainder of the season on loan away from Greater Manchester. But Rasmus Hojlund is also in the headlines following reported interest from Inter Milan.",

      "Lisandro Martinez is reportedly not interested in a move to Napoli and is determined to remain at Manchester United, according to Mail Sport.",
      "Martinez is under contract at Old Trafford until the summer of 2027. While Napoli may be hopeful of a deal, their chances could depend on Sir Jim Ratcliffe’s ongoing efforts to raise funds through player sales.",
      "The summer transfer window has been open for just four days and one thing has already become abundantly clear: Manchester United have not lost their pulling power...",
      "...It remains to be seen which direction United's striker search will now head in, but there are a handful of obvious candidates the club could turn to in their hunt for a chief goal-getter. Few are more appealing than Napoli striker Victor Osimhen.",
      "The Nigerian international, 26, has made a name for himself after becoming one of Europe's most prolific strikers in recent years. In the last three seasons alone, he has scored 85 goals.",
      "Osimhen spent this season on loan at Turkish club Galatasaray, scoring 37 times in 41 games, after falling out with Napoli head coach Antonio Conte last summer. Conte later admitted a permanent exit for the striker would have been \"better\"...",

      "After Harry Maguire signed an extension with the club earlier this year, Amorim said: \"When you look at our team, we are starving for leaders on the pitch. He [Maguire] is a leader. We are happy to continue with him.\"",
      "As per the Daily Express, Brentford boss Thomas Frank said in 2023: \"He's [Mbeumo] definitely a leader in the making.\" This is surely music to Amorim's ears.",
      "Manchester United are said to be in direct communication with Brentford regarding a move for Bryan Mbeumo.",
      "Ben Jacobs wrote on X: \"Manchester United are now in club-to-club talks with Brentford over Bryan Mbeumo. No bid yet.",

      "\"Brentford currently using £62.5m Cunha fee as a valuation yardstick but MUFC believe a lower fee is possible, especially with Mbeumo keen on the move\"",
      "Manchester United midfielder Sekou Kone could leave the club on loan this summer.",

      "Speaking on his YouTube channel, the Manchester United legend said: \"Listen, I've got to be honest with you. I don't know if I could have said no. He's 30 years old, at a club that [is] struggling.",
      "“Bruno’s staying, our most potent goalscorer, our biggest provider, our biggest chance maker, he does a lot and our captain.",
      "“I couldn’t have woken up this morning happier, and I did message him. I won’t go into the details of that, but what a man.”",
      "Departing Manchester United midfielder Christian Eriksen has revealed where he would like to go after his contract runs out this summer.",
      "The Danish international has spent the last three seasons with the club after transfering from Brentford. After a decade playing in England's top flight, Eriksen is looking for something new.",
      "He told Danish TV: \"“I would rather get away from the Premier League. I feel like I've taken my turn in the Premier League, so I'm looking outside the English borders. It has been a great place for me and my family, and we have been there for many years.",
      "\"When I moved from Tottenham to Inter, it wasn't my plan to go back to England either. After that I've been there for three and a half years again, so you should never say never. But my priority is that I have to leave.\"",
      "Two Italian media outlets are reporting Napoli's interest in Manchester United defender Lisandro Martinez.",
      "The Argentine defender has been sidelined since Febuary after suffering a cruciate ligament injury. Despite the 27-year-old's recovery possibly lasting until Febuary next year, Napoli have no conerns over long-term fitness.",
      "There are no reports that Martinez is up for sale, but it seems every player at United has a price this summer.",
      "Manchester United captain Bruno Fernandes has played down the role of his wife in his decision to reject Al-Hilal.",
      "Al-Hilal were interested in signing Mohamed Salah from Liverpool, but Salah committed his future to Anfield and they turned their attention to landing Fernandes as a marquee signing.",

      "Jadon Sancho's return to Manchester United following his loan spell at Chelsea could be short-lived.",
      "The Englishman didn't sign permanently for Chelsea due to the two parties failing to agree on salary and financial terms. With Sancho set to return to Old Trafford at the end of June, transfer expert Fabrizio Romano doesn't believe he'll be there long.",
      "He wrote on X: \"Jadon Sancho, not expected to stay at Manchester United this summer. He's included in list of players for sale to generate funds and reinvest on different signings.",
      "\"Sancho's camp will assess options in the upcoming days/weeks.\"",
      "Ian Wright has revealed what he thinks will happen to Bryan Mbeumo if the Brentford star moves to Manchester United.",
      "He told the Wrighty's House Podcast: \"When you saw it, like obviously Ivan Toney took all the plaudits at Brentford, but when you watched him then and watched the, you’re looking at it now and it’s more consistent, and you think, yeah.",
      "\"It’s the only thing I’m surprised about with him, is that he’s only 26.",
      "“You know something, if he goes to United I think that he’s somebody that, if he gets in the moments that he’s had for Brentford, for United, he will then realise where he is. Because he goes to another level with the attention from United.”",
      "Inter Milan are considering making a move for Manchester United striker Rasmus Hojlund this summer as the beaten Champions League finalists seek to accelerate a rebuild of their squad.",
      "Hojlund spent the season as United's first-choice No. 9 but he had an underwhelming campaign, scoring just four goals in 32 Premier League appearances. His record across two seasons at Old Trafford in all competitions stands at 26 goals in 95 appearances.",

      "Hojlund's performances at United have attracted criticism since his £64million move from Atalanta, with the fee rising to a potential £72million, but there has been interest from Serie A clubs in taking him back to Italy...",
      "Jadon Sancho has reportedly been 'offered' in a swap deal for West Ham's Mohammed Kudus.",

      "According to Caught Offside, United technical director Jason Wilcox has 'offered' Sancho to West Ham in a swap deal for Kudus.",

      "...Gyokeres, who is also being courted by Arsenal and Chelsea, is reported to have a €100million (£84million) release clause in his contract at Sporting. There have been suggestions, though, that the Portuguese club could be willing to allow the striker to leave this summer for a fee closer to £60million",
      "Amid the continued speculation, Gyokeres has provided a hint that his future may still lie in Portugal despite being linked with a move away from Sporting. The striker has opened up on why he is enjoying life in Lisbon, hinting that he may not be leaving this summer after all...",

      "In a sensational claim, Keown believes with the games that the current United head coach lost during his first six months, he faces pressure in the start of his first full Premier League campaign.",
      "He said: “Just look at the number of games they’ve lost. It’s going to be a very interesting start to next season for them but they could do a lot worse than go and get Jurgen Klopp to manage their football club.",
      "\"I’m not trying to sensationalise. I believe he could do an incredible job there and I believe they need somebody with more experience than the current manager.”",
      "One of the big stories from yesterday was Bruno Fernandes.",
      "As per reports, he rejected Al Hilal's transfer proposal.",

      "\"They were waiting for me. I spoke to coach [Ruben] Amorim. He asked me not to go.",
      "\"Manchester United didn’t want to sell me. They don’t need the money. If I had wanted to leave, they would have made it happen.“",
      "He added: \"Al Hilal were very kind. They spoke to my agent. Then I spoke to my wife. She asked: 'What do you want to do?' She always supports my decisions.",
      "\"It would have been easy to move there. I know the Portuguese players there very well. But I want to play at the highest level and compete for major titles.",
      "\"I can do that, and I still want to. I’m very passionate about football.”",

      "That is according to our sister title, the Liverpool Echo, who have reported that Liverpool officials are 'baffled' by the ongoing speculation concerning his future.",
      "Barcelona sporting director Deco recently confirmed the La Liga champions' interest in Diaz and Manchester United attacker Marcus Rashford. The latter is available to leave United this summer for a fee of £40million.",
      "United have no plans to reintegrate Rashford back into the first-team squad at Old Trafford after spending the second half of this season on loan at Aston Villa. The club anticipates he will move abroad.",
      "Barcelona have long since appealed to Rashford, 27, and the Spanish outfit is keen on the possibility of signing him this summer.",
      "\"We like Luis, and we like Rashford, but we can't talk about players who are under contract,\" Deco told RAC1 last month. \"For me, it's much more important to improve what we have at home.\"",
      "Amid Liverpool's bemusement that Diaz could be available to Barcelona and other suitors this summer, it means the five-time Champions League winners could now prioritise a swoop for Rashford in their quest to strengthen their attacking options.",
      "As already documented, United want to sell Rashford in this summer's window and it is understood he is valued at £40m.",
      "He was banished from the first-team squad by head coach Ruben Amorim last December and his stint at Villa yielded just four goals in 17 appearances.",

      "The representative of Paris Saint-Germain's goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma has quashed rumours of a surprise move to Manchester United by confirming ongoing negotiations with his current club over a new deal. Donnarumma, 26, played a part in PSG's Champions League final triumph on Saturday, where they trounced Inter Milan 5-0 in Munich — although he wasn't heavily tested during the match.",
      "This marks the second European title for the former AC Milan keeper, who was Italy's hero at Euro 2020 with two crucial penalty saves in the final against England. He joined PSG on a five-year contract after leaving Milan under contentious circumstances.",
      "With his current contract set to expire in June 2026, there have been reports this week that Manchester United hold an interest in signing him. United's manager Ruben Amorim is reportedly keen on bringing in a new goalkeeper due to concerns about Andre Onana, but the club isn't looking to make a significant investment — unless their main goalkeeper opts to depart.",
      "Foot Mercato, via GFFN, this week reported that United have an interest in signing the Italian shotstopper, with his agent now responding to the rumours. Enzo Raiola – cousin of the late renowned agent Mino Raiola – has dismissed such speculation as 'pure fantasy'.",
      "Raiola emphasised that their focus is on discussions with PSG to prolong Donnarumma's tenure in the French capital. \"It's pure fantasy. I've an excellent relationship with Director Giovanni Manna at [Napoli], but we've never discussed Gigio,\" Raiola stated to Radio CRC, as reported by Calciomercato, via the Mirror.",
      "\"It's an obvious question. Many would like him, but only a few can afford him. He feels good in Paris, we're at the European champion club, so we have no complaints. We are working on a renewal [with PSG].\"",
      "However, Raiola did not dismiss the possibility of a future move to Napoli for Donnarumma, who hails from Castellammare, a town in the Metropolitan City of Naples. \"His mother is a huge Napoli fan, and she gets anxious watching their games. Gigio is connected to that,\" his agent added.",
      "\"He grew up as a Milan supporter, watching his older brothers in a Rossoneri shirt, but he never denied his roots. In fact, his first stop during the holidays is always Castellammare.\"",
      "Donnarumma's form took a hit in the early part of the season, but he and his teammates found their stride after the winter break, clinching the treble. His crucial saves against Premier League teams Liverpool, Aston Villa, and Arsenal in the Champions League knockout stages were instrumental to Luis Enrique's triumphant side."

      "After leaving United following a short-term stint as caretaker boss in December 2021, Carrick landed his first full-time post in management when he was appointed Middlesbrough head coach in October 2022.",
      "After succeeding former boss Chris Wilder when they were 21st in the table, Carrick guided Boro to a fourth-placed finish, meaning they secured a play-off spot. However, they were beaten 1-0 by Coventry at the semi-final stage.",
      "In 2023/24, Boro were expected to challenge for promotion once again, and they did so right until the latter stages of the season. However, they finished eighth, four points shy of the final play-off spot.",
      "This season, they were once again expected to challenge for promotion, and after two near misses, it was hoped it would be third time lucky for Carrick, who found himself under pressure and facing the axe earlier this year.",
      "Despite taking their play-off push to the final day of the season, they fell short of the expected standard. Carrick took charge of 136 matches in total and also guided the club to the League Cup semi-finals in 2023/24."

      "However, he excelled in his debut season in Poland making 24 appearances, helping them win the Polish Cup. He started the final, helping Legia beat Pogon Szczecin 4-3 in the final.",
      "After four difficult and deeply frustrating seasons at Old Trafford, United cashed-in on Van de Beek last July, selling him to Spanish club Girona for a minimal fee. The deal included various clauses that could still see United bank north of £7million.",
      "His first season in Spain saw him rack up up 35 appearances, scoring three goals and registering five assists. Girona narrowly avoided relegation from La Liga, finishing just two places and one point above the relegation zone.",
      "Out of contract at Old Trafford this summer, United made the decision to cash-in on the Tunisian last year. He joined Burnley in a deal worth £5.4m, which could still rise to £9.4m.",
      "Hannibal's first season at Turf Moor saw him help the Clarets secure an immediate return to the Premier League, helping them secure the Championship's second automatic promotion spot with a whopping 100 points. He made 39 appearances in all competitions, scoring one goal and creating five.",
      "After scoring ten goals in 2023/24, United made the decision to cash-in on McTominay last August amid the fact he had entered the final year of his contract. His stock was at an all-time high and the £25.7m fee United banked for him counted as pure profit due to his status as a homegrown player.",
      "His debut season at Napoli was nothing short of outstanding, with his return of 12 Serie A goals helping them clinch a second league title in three seasons. McTominay, 28, is adored by Napoli's supporters, meaning he has become a firm fans' favourite.",
      "After failing to sign a new contract at Old Trafford last summer, Shoretire left United after more than a decade on their books and was snapped up by Greek side PAOK. The 21-year-old signed a four-year contact.",
      "The winger, who was born in Newcastle, made 27 appearances in his debut season for the Greek club, including six outings in the Europa League. He scored four goals.",
      "Following the conclusion of last season, Forson was offered a contract to stay at Old Trafford. He had made seven first-team appearances during the 2023/24 campaign, including one Premier League start.",
      "However, he turned the offer down and moved to Italian side AC Monza, earning United a compensation fee. His maiden season in Italy saw him struggle for game time, racking up just 13 appearances across all competitions, earning just one Serie A start.",
      "Despite offering glimpses of his capabilities at Old Trafford, Pellistri's tally of 25 appearances in four years meant it was in everyone's best interests to go their separate ways last August. He was sold to Greek club Panathinaikos for an initial fee of £5.1m.",
      "His debut season in Greece was relatively solid, with his 35 appearances yielding four goals and five assists. However, he was not a regular starter. United have a buy-back option open for three years.",
      "After spending the 2023/24 season on loan at Spanish side Getafe, United sold Greenwood on a permanent basis last July. He joined French side Marseille in a deal that could be worth up £26.6m.",
      "His first season in France was a roaring success, as he scored 22 goals in 36 matches in all competitions. His haul of 21 league goals saw him finish the season as Ligue 1's joint-top leading goalscorer alongside Paris Saint-Germain star Ousmane Dembele. Marseille finished second in the league table.",
      "Following nine years at Old Trafford, Martial was released upon the expiry of his contract. Without a club until mid-September, he was eventually snapped up by Greek outfit AEK Athens.",
      "The Frenchman, who struggled with injuries in his final two seasons at Old Trafford, plundered nine goals and registered two assists in his first season in Greece. He is under contract until 2027.",
      "McNeill was released following the expiry of his contract and was snapped up by Championship side Sheffield Wednesday, signing a three-year deal. He had previously spent time at Hillsborough as part of United's Pro Experience Programme.",
      "Despite making a dream start to his Owls career, scoring twice on his debut in a 2-1 win over Hull City in the first round of the Carabao Cup, McNeill found opportunities difficult to come by, making just seven appearances all season. Wednesday, however, signed him with a long-term plan in mind."

      "From the high of winning a European trophy, to the disappointment of failing to agree terms with Chelsea.",
      "Jadon Sancho will not be joining Chelsea on a permanent transfer, which means the Blues will now pay a £5million penalty charge to Manchester United to break the agreement.",
      "It's unprecedented for a club to pay £5m to break their obligation agreement and the ordeal is embarrassing for Sancho, whose career has sadly nosedived over the last few years.",
      "Sancho was an England international and one of the most exciting players in Europe when he arrived at Old Trafford. His decline began after signing for Manchester United and he failed to arrest his slump at Chelsea.",
      "The London-born lad scored in 4-1 victory against Real Betis in the Conference League final and will argue his loan was a success. Sancho will point to scoring in that game and his winner's medal. It's also important to note the move has collapsed due to Chelsea not being willing to meet his wage demands.",
      "That doesn't necessarily mean Chelsea don't want Sancho, but it does mean they don't believe he is worth the salary, and maybe that wouldn't have been an issue if he'd performed better.",
      "Sancho's contribution of five goals and 10 assists has been deemed not good enough for the wages he wants and Chelsea are set to move on to Jamie Gittens from Borussia Dortmund.",
      "Chelsea want to sign Gittens in a £50million deal before the Club World Cup and Sancho should probably feel further embarrassment over that transfer for two different reasons.",
      "The first reason is that Gittens has leapfrogged Sancho, despite having been years behind him.",
      "Dortmund visited Leigh Sports Village to play United Under-19s in March 2022 and won on penalties, but a 16-year-old Gittens scored a brace in normal time and was the star of the show.",
      "At that time, Sancho had already spent eight months in Manchester after signing from Dortmund in a £72.9m transfer. He was regarded among the world's finest players, while Gittens was a teenager playing in front of a sparse crowd.",
      "The second reason is that Gittens is represented by the same agency - Elite Project Group - as Sancho. They know each other well and their career pathways have been similar.",
      "Sancho and Gittens both played in Manchester City's academy before joining Dortmund. There have been comparisons made between the pair and Gittens has given the impression of being a miniature Sancho.",
      "However, 'little brother' could surpass 'big brother' if he joins Chelsea this summer.",
      "Sancho will probably be happy for his agency stablemate Gittens and he might even advise him about what to expect at Cobham, although the optics of the move are not great for him.",
      "Gittens was just 16 and hadn't had a sniff of senior football when Sancho signed for United, so far apart were they in their careers, but that is clearly no longer the case.",
      "It must be said, Gittens always seemed destined to become a top player, but Sancho hasn't maintained his top player status and looks set to be surpassed by Gittens."

      "The Saudi Arabian side's interest in the Portuguese international emerged last week and it was claimed they were prepared to make a £100million offer to secure his signature.",
      "Fernandes, 30, was understood to have given the move serious consideration amid United's willingness to sell any member of the squad this summer.",
      "However, he confirmed at a press conference on Tuesday evening that he has turned down a move to the Saudi outfit because of his hunger to continue playing at the highest level, boosting United's chances of retaining their star player.",

      "Fernandes is central to Amorim's plans, with the former Sporting Lisbon man often getting United out of trouble this season. He is effective from pretty much anywhere on the pitch and will always contribute goals and assists.",
      "Furthermore, Amorim has already admitted he will be key to United's hopes of attempting to return to the top step of English football's podium in the coming years.",

      "\"Between assists and goals, he's there for 30 at least. He's the type of player we want here, he's not going anywhere.\"",
      "Fernandes' durability and reliability is one of his biggest strengths. He played 57 times for United this season, missing only three matches, two of which were through suspension.",
      "United, as tempting as a £100m bid might have been for a soon-to-be 31-year-old, need players like Fernandes. He has been their best player of the post-Sir Alex Ferguson era by some distance, and Amorim loves him.",
      "His desire to continue playing at the highest level will be music to Amorim's ears, and it shows that Fernandes has put his football career before wealth. It is characters of that ilk that both United and Amorim need."

      "4) Ousmane Dembele – £135m/€147m (Borussia Dortmund to Barcelona, August 2017)\nWith a bruised ego and the Neymar cash burning a hole in their back pocket, Barcelona had tried all summer to sign Coutinho but after facing resistance from Liverpool, they went cap in hand to Dortmund for their back-up instead. And lessons were learned with a £369.6m release clause inserted this time – not that the Frenchman has ever come close to warranting such lavish interest until he found his ambipedal feet at PSG.",
      "",
      "5) Joao Felix – £113m/€126m (Benfica to Atletico Madrid, July 2019)\nPerhaps the worst match of player and manager there has ever been for a club-record transfer. How strange that the skilful individualist forward who doesn’t track back never meshed with a totalitarian coach who demands suffering and sacrifice from his subordinates. How strange that Atletico committed such sums on a teenager with 45 career first-team appearances. How strange that they couldn’t find anyone to buy him until Chelsea rocked up again.",
      "",
      "6) Antoine Griezmann – £107m/€120m (Atletico Madrid to Barcelona, July 2019)\nAfter The Decision favoured Atletico in 2018, the Frenchman could no longer avoid the Barcelona pull a year later in a sale which enraged Los Rojiblancos, considering a £180m release clause had only expired a couple of weeks before. Griezmann has somehow managed to remain without a La Liga winner’s medal through it all, timing his moves back and forth to Atletico and Barca comedically poorly.",
      "",
      "7) Jack Grealish – £100m/€117.5m (Aston Villa to Manchester City, August 2021)\nWhile it looked like an ungainly fit at first, Grealish went an awfully long way towards justifying his astronomical fee as a key part of a Treble-winning, mass-celebrating machine in his second season at the Etihad. Then it all started to fall apart again as he lost his way.",
      "",
      "8) Neymar – £86.3m/€100m (Paris Saint-Germain to Al-Hilal, August 2023)\nThat world-record, market-breaking move to France delivered neither the Ballon d’Or nor the non-Barcelona Champions League that Neymar craved, so the Brazilian decided to cheat by joining the most successful side in AFC Champions League history for loadsa money, loadsa cars, loadsa bedrooms and loadsa saunas. A ruptured knee ligament meant he played seven times in Saudi Arabia before being released by mutual consent.",
      "",
      "9) Gareth Bale – £85.2m/€100m (Tottenham to Real Madrid, September 2013)\nAfter cramming half of his total Premier League goals by that point into a single phenomenal season, Bale became the latest obsession of a Real Madrid side desperate to win La Decima. The Welshman helped deliver that in his first campaign with a decisive goal in the Champions League final – the first of five European Cups and second of 15 trophies for a player the supporters nevertheless came to hate.",
      "",
      "10) Antony – £82m/€95m (Ajax to Man Utd, September 2022)\nErik ten Hag put all his eggs in the Antony basket but a few must have cracked in transit from Amsterdam, the relatively slow and predominantly one-footed winger scoring eight goals and assisting three in a 44-game debut season.",
      "",
      "11) Jadon Sancho – £73m/€85m (Borussia Dortmund to Man Utd, July 2021)\nIn his three full seasons with Borussia Dortmund, Sancho’s least productive campaign was his first, when he scored 13 goals and provided 20 assists in 43 games. Across an entire Man Utd career which still technically remains a live thing after Chelsea paid £5m to return him rather than £25m to sign him, the forward has scored 12 goals and assisted six in 83 games.",
      "",
      "12) Nicolas Pepe – £72m/€80m (Lille to Arsenal, August 2019)\nAfter offering the closest challenge to Kylian Mbappe for the Ligue Un Golden Boot, Arsenal spent what was a club-record fee on a player who has popped up around France, Turkey and Spain since being long outgrown by the upwardly mobile Gunners.",
      "",
      "13) Neymar – £71.5m/€86.2m (Santos to Barcelona, June 2013)\nThe financial details are wonderfully murky but official documents submitted to the authority revealed the final fee, as well as a €40m payment to Neymar’s parents.",
      "",
      "14) Kai Havertz – £71m/€80m (Bayer Leverkusen to Chelsea, September 2020)\nExpensive flop who never fit into one defined position and suffered for regular managerial upheaval? Or scorer of the winning goals in the Champions League and Club World Cup finals? A little from column A, a little from column B.",
      "",
      "15) Julian Alvarez – £64m/€75.8m (Manchester City to Atletico Madrid, August 2024)\nThe fee could rise to £80m but eyebrows were raised when Manchester City squeezed quite so much out of Atletico, even for a world champion with 54 goal contributions and six trophies in 103 appearances. A 29-goal debut season in Spain made it seem more as though the Premier League side had been fleeced.",
      "",
      "16) James Rodriguez – £63m/€80m (Monaco to Real Madrid, July 2014)\nA proper throwback transfer pretty much solely down to Rodriguez starring at the World Cup, the Colombian won a fair few trinkets at the Bernabeu but never came close to settling or justifying that fee.",
      "",
      "17) Matheus Cunha – £62.5m/€74.2m (Wolves to Man Utd, June 2025)\nIn a welcome sign they are returning to a formerly successful transfer policy, Manchester United chucked a whole load of money at a team below them in the Premier League’s bottom half by virtue of goal difference alone.",
      "",
      "18) Kai Havertz – £62m/€71.7m (Chelsea to Arsenal, June 2023)\nMikel Arteta saw enough in those three mixed years at Stamford Bridge to deem Havertz crucial to his Arsenal process. Almost no-one else thought it was a signing worth making but the vision has become clearer over time, particularly so in the German’s injury-enforced absence.",
      "",
      "19) Mykhaylo Mudryk – £62m/€70m (Shakhtar Donetsk to Chelsea, January 2023)\nThe biggest possible fee is the one most often quoted but Chelsea would be absolutely delighted if they end up paying the full £88.5m/€100m for Mudryk, who is embroiled in a drugs test fiasco.",
      "",
      "20) Riyad Mahrez – £60m/€68m (Leicester to Manchester City, July 2018)\nAn underappreciated Premier League legend only reinforced his status at Manchester City. Just 10 players have won more Premier League titles – none of whom have a medal with two different clubs – than Mahrez, who ranks joint 53rd all-time for goals and 21st for assists.",

      "Do you know what has ‘surprised’ Bruno Fernandes about Marcus Rashford? His pace. More importantly, do you know when it surprised him? In 2020, just after he joined United. It would be very odd if he were still surprised by it five years later.",

      "Sorry, what? That’s one crunching gear change.",
      "Last week Earps called time on her international career. The decision followed a meeting with England manager Sarina Wiegman, in which she was told she wouldn’t be her number one goalkeeper at the Euros.",
      "So instead of digging in, in a bid to win back her place in the team, Earps took the easier option. Now we know the real reasons she was known as ‘Mary, Queen of Stops’.",

      "But Root realised people like him are a long time retired. He still had a love of batting and a heck of a lot more to give. And unlike Earps, when the going got tough, Root got going.",
      "Since relinquishing the captaincy to focus solely on batting, Root has gone on to smash bowlers to all four corners of the world. He has overtaken Sir Alastair Cook as England’s greatest Test run scorer.",
      "Look, Joe Root is lovely and brilliant and all the rest of it, but this is a genuinely insane comparison.",
      "These are not remotely comparable situations. When he gave up the captaincy, Root was 31 years old and unquestionably still England’s best batter. There was no suggestion whatsoever he might lose his place in England’s first-choice XI, as Earps has.",
      "Faced with entirely different situations, Root wanted to carry on and Earps didn’t. Both are entirely valid choices and neither really any of our business.",
      "You don’t have to like the choice Earps has made, and especially the way it’s all played out, but you do have to acknowledge that her situation and Root’s are not in any useful or meaningful way the same, and not just because they play completely different sports.",

      "Here for free – important, that – is a proven goalscorer, a fox in the box, a nasty b*stard (meant entirely as a compliment) and a title winner who could take the number of Premier League champions in the Old Trafford dressing room to… one. Vardy would be an asset to Ruben Amorim, putting him in a very select group of Manchester United footballers.",
      "I’m not ignoring the obvious point of contention: Vardy is old. Thirty-eight. Which in footballer years is ancient.",
      "But he hasn’t got as many miles on the clock as veterans of a similar age. Vardy’s professional career started at 24; his Football League career at 25. Most of his contemporaries reach 14 years as a senior pro between 32 and 34.",
      "And United absolutely don’t need Vardy for the future. Their outlay on wages will not be recouped and there will be no resale value. Not every signing can be viewed in such terms. But signing the ex-England striker could be seen as an investment in the younger forwards who so clearly need the spark and guidance Vardy could offer.",
      "But more than a mentor, Vardy can still show how it’s done. In a genuinely awful Leicester side, he scored more Premier League goals than any United player last season, and in 35 appearances, he played more minutes than all but two of Amorim’s outfielders.",
      "Right now, Amorim has one centre-forward he can call upon: Rasmus Hojlund. And they would sell him without hesitation if someone offered half the price they paid in 2023. The chances of that seem as low as the Dane’s goals record last season. And his confidence. But if they get him some help, in terms of service and a stand-in, it could yet work out if United are forced to make the best of him.",
      "That is especially true since Liam Delap thought Chelsea – Todd Boehly’s Chelsea – were better trusted with his development. Even if Delap had been convinced to join United, they would still have needed a more experienced striker given they currently have none.",
      "They might sign Bryan Mbeumo. And many would expect that to be a savvy addition. But what would they be signing in Mbeumo? Certainly not an out-and-out striker. Much of the appeal is the Cameroonian’s ability to play across the front line. He scored 20 goals last season, many of them while drifting in from the Brentford right, and it seems Amorim eyes Mbeumo more as a no.10.",
      "🔴⚪⚫ MORE MAN UTD FROM F365\n👉 Every signing post-Sir Alex ranked: Sancho, Antony bottom five, Ronaldo 7th; Mbeumo next?\n👉 Mbeumo to Manchester United will be among the biggest steps down in transfer history\n👉 Mood rankings: United not the most miserable club in Manchester",
      "With Matheus Cunha already waiting to welcome Mbeumo if United stop irritating Brentford for long enough to get a deal done, United suddenly have creative options beyond Bruno Fernandes, who could be used in the deeper role Amorim liked for his skipper for much of last season.",
      "But what good is all that creativity without someone to apply the finishing touch? If United somehow muster the money to buy a proven no.9 – not another 9.5 – their centre-forward pool is still perilously shallow, even allowing for the lighter workload without European involvement.",
      "United haven’t been scared of recruiting veteran strikers. Zlatan Ibrahimovic was 35; Henrik Larsson was 34. Both were big hits at Old Trafford, for their influence in the dressing room as much as their impact in the box.",
      "Vardy could have a similar impact. He insists he is not looking to wind down after leaving Leicester, and Ruud van Nistelrooy offered a glowing reference: “He is one of the most open and honest people I have met…he isn’t hard to manage.”",
      "Like Zlatan for Jose Mourinho and Larsson for Fergie, Vardy would be a leader for Amorim, a manager with pitifully few such characters to lean on, and a goal threat where currently there is almost none.",

      "“There were three categories to the policy,” the pundit said. “He wanted to promote youth wherever possible, that was number one before he even looked at the external market.”",
      "If “promote” is actually a synonym for “offload” – and in the dictionary of Big Sir Jim most things seem to be – then consider that box ticked by Man Utd in 2025.",
      "“Number two was to look at the best in the Premier League; those he could trust and still have growth and be with the club for a long time: Gary Pallister, Steve Bruce, Wayne Rooney, Rio Ferdinand, Robin van Persie.”",
      "The signing of Matheus Cunha, pursuit of Bryan Mbeumo and potential targeting of more stars close to home suggests the dying art which underpinned so much of the club’s modern success has been resuscitated.",
      "“And then he always wanted emerging international talent that could come over to Manchester, that he could work with and develop into great players: Nemanja Vidic, Peter Schmeichel, Patrice Evra, Cristiano Ronaldo, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer.”",
      "Rasmus Hojlund, Manuel Ugarte, Antony, Andre Onana. The list goes on.",
      "The second point is the most pertinent to the current era and provides long-overdue proof of some joined-up thinking with recruitment at Carrington. Mbeumo and Cunha were the two biggest overperformers on xG in the Premier League last season, are 25 and 26 and feel like precisely the sort of signings Liverpool would make under Jurgen Klopp: players proven in the ever-improving middle of England’s top flight, but with an obvious scalability to develop and perform at a higher level.",

      "That comes with caveats: one season of xG overperformance presents obvious issues with sustainability and these are extortionate costs for a club publicly walking a PSR tightrope, who need to nail every aspect of their transfer business this summer. But if the argument was that sacrificing Alejandro Garnacho and Kobbie Mainoo would only be for the greater good if Man Utd could be trusted to spend the money properly, removing their erratic and unreliable recruitment from the equation to simply buy the closest things to guaranteed successes might make it work.",
      "Ferguson leaned on those intra-Premier League transfers to build the foundation for each of his great Man Utd squads. There were some David Bellions along the way but a ludicrous XI can be assembled from such signings: Van der Sar; Valencia, Smalling, Ferdinand, Young; Keane, Carrick, Smith; Tevez, Yorke, Rooney, with Robin van Persie, Dimitar Berbatov, Teddy Sheringham and Phil Jones on an absurdly attacking bench.",
      "But in the years since his retirement it was an ideology slowly phased out for style over substance, culminating in the ruinous summer of 2021. Man Utd were at a crossroads, Premier League and Europa League runners-up with fairly deep runs in the domestic cups behind them, but with a strong sense that while Ole Gunnar Solskjaer had built a solid base, he had reached a point where someone else was required to push on and capitalise on his work.",
      "Man Utd avoided answering that awkward question and signed players from Real Madrid, Juventus and Borussia Dortmund instead, because they wanted the honour and esteem of being seen to deal with such clubs without a second thought as to whether Raphael Varane, Cristiano Ronaldo or Jadon Sancho actually added more to the squad than they took away, and Solskjaer was sacked within a matter of months.",
      "The club chose the wrong path then, in their last true position of strength in summer 2023 when they hedged one too many bets on Onana, Mason Mount and Hojlund, and the following year when instead of sacking Erik ten Hag, they doubled down by spending £200m on players not only specifically for him, but categorically incompatible with the replacement they inevitably had to appoint.",
      "The hope is that hitting rock bottom can prompt better decisions at this latest seasonal junction; the early signs are promising. Neville once said “if you had the best player in the Premier League, Man Utd had to buy that player”. Times have changed and those signings have long been unattainable, but buying the best Premier League players actually available to them seems like a sensible alternative Man Utd have long ignored.",

      "Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo picking this abysmal version of Manchester United over Champions League teams has boggled minds but there is plenty of precedent.",
      "While Cunha has joined from Wolves with little competition for his signature, the revelation that Mbeumo wants to join Manchester United, a team which finished five places lower than the Brentford side for which he scored 20 Premier League goals last season, has confused many.",
      "Newcastle, Spurs and Arsenal were all linked with the Cameroonian forward but it is hardly the first time Manchester United have beaten Champions League clubs to a signing despite having no Champions League football to offer themselves. Plenty of other clubs have managed it too.",
      "",
      "10) Bruno Guimaraes\nThe spot could just as easily go to Alexander Isak, but Newcastle were at least on an obvious upward trajectory when they shattered their transfer record to sign the Swede from Real Sociedad in August 2022.",
      "The Magpies would qualify for the Champions League at the end of that season, with Isak’s goals a critical factor in helping transform Eddie Howe’s side. Yet it was Guimaraes who boarded the ship when the shore was a speck in the distance.",
      "Newcastle were in the relegation zone below Norwich when they somehow tempted Guimaraes to turn his back on long-term interest from Arsenal, the Brazilian having also popped up on radars at Manchester United and Paris Saint-Germain.",
      "“We are definitely going to be a club that is going to be a big power in world football,” said Guimaraes, and while it seems obvious in hindsight, in the exciting but uncertain post-takeover haze, it was far from guaranteed that Newcastle would embark on a revolution he helped kickstart.",
      "",
      "9) Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang\nThings did not work out in a way that suited any party. The captain’s armband was stripped, the non-negotiables were ignored, backs were stabbed and the contract Arsenal were desperate for Aubameyang to sign after winning them the FA Cup was written off months early.",
      "Yet for a time there was talk of statues, proof of leadership, the glory of trophies and the scoring of more Premier League goals than Alexis Sanchez in fewer appearances than Philippe Senderos.",
      "It is a truly imperious record for Arsene Wenger’s last signing as a manager. A club-record fee was needed to extract Aubameyang from Borussia Dortmund, the Gabon international departing as the Bundesliga’s Player of the Year in 2016 and Golden Boot winner of 2017. By the time it came to leaving Germany in January 2018, Arsenal were sixth in the Premier League and locked in the existential crisis that was their first year outside the Champions League since 2000.",
      "Aubameyang was supposed to be one of the building blocks placed in the foundation of Arsenal’s recovery; his removal ended up being part of the process in re-establishing their relevance as a force.",
      "",
      "8) Sadio Mane\n“If a player only wants to come to Man United to play Champions League, then he won’t come. We want players who want to represent United, not players who want to play certain competitions,” Ruben Amorim told Viktor Gyokeres.",
      "Jurgen Klopp ultimately put it best:",
      "“I always tell players if, when you are 35 or 36, you look back on your career and think about the one year you didn’t play Champions League, then you are really a poor boy. There are so many things you can do and reach if you go together with the team. You can qualify for the Champions League, play Champions League, maybe win it or whatever. That is a much more satisfying thing than all the rest. That is what I would say to players: ‘It is about pushing the train, not jumping on a running train.’ That is what we need here. If somebody says: ‘But you don’t play Champions League next year’, then goodbye and thank you, have fun next year wherever you will be. We will find players or we have players already that will go our way. That is not my way, that is the normal way for a club not playing in the Champions League.”",
      "The German did not have to worry about it often, only coaching two full Liverpool seasons outside Europe’s elite competition, but it was true. The Reds signed Sadio Mane 88 days later and Klopp secured one of the strongest pushers of his Champions League train in the process.",
      "Not only were the Reds out of Europe altogether in summer 2016, but they had finished two places below the Southampton side they were buying from. Mane bet not only on himself but the Klopp vision. A Premier League, Champions League, Super Cup, Club World Cup and Golden Boot suggests he was right.",
      "",
      "7) Moises Caicedo\nLiverpool supporters consumed dangerous and absurd levels of copium to come to terms with Caicedo’s decision to reject them in favour of joining Chelsea in the summer of 2023.",
      "It was understandable to an extent. The Reds, managed by Jurgen Klopp, had just finished seven places higher than the Blues, who were a bastion of instability and player churn. The decision between the two seemed obvious once it was clear both were willing to make it worth Brighton’s trouble.",
      "But players tend not to glance at the most recent league table before making career calls. Caicedo took the most expensive step down in Premier League history and has played a considerable part in pulling Chelsea back up since.",
      "",
      "6) Leny Yoro\nReal Madrid, Paris Saint-Germain and Liverpool were among those linked but it was Manchester United who completed a genuine transfer coup in signing a player former sporting director Dan Ashworth described as “one of the most exciting young defenders in world football”.",
      "Some will put that down to money, or more specifically the pressure selling club Lille reportedly applied on Yoro to take the more lucrative Manchester United offer.",
      "But for a Europa League club to capture such a coveted teenager was yet more proof of that unique allure Manchester United still possess. Yoro was seven when they had last won the title and still in nappies for their most recent Champions League crowning, yet Old Trafford still called.",
      "",
      "5) Luis Suarez\nWhile he would win the Champions League with Barcelona in 2015, Suarez had only graced the competition proper in one season, scoring a solitary goal during the 2010/11 campaign in which Ajax exited at the group stage.",
      "He joined Liverpool later that season and by the time he had finally dragged them to European Cup qualification for the first time in half a decade in 2014, the Uruguayan forewent the fruits of his labour to rock up in Spain.",
      "Liverpool had finished seventh before Suarez joined, then sixth, eighth and seventh with him. But the forward was not tainted by those years of stagnation, scoring more than 50 goals. Among them were his efforts in the Europa League as Suarez netted four times in seven appearances in the 2012/13 season, which ended with him imploring Liverpool “to honour our agreement”, namely:",
      "“Last year I had the opportunity to move to a big European club and I stayed on the understanding that if we failed to qualify for the Champions League the following season I’d be allowed to go.”",
      "The Emirates was smoking to the tune of £1 but Suarez caught fire in 2013/14, rocketing Liverpool to a Premier League title tilt that faded in spectacular fashion for a runners-up medal. He left for Barcelona instead of sticking around long enough for Brendan Rodgers to put him on the bench at the Bernabeu.",
      "",
      "4) Zlatan Ibrahimovic\nFrom his humble beginnings at Ajax in 2002/03 to the understated modesty that helped steer Paris Saint-Germain in 2015/16, Ibrahimovic did not miss a single Champions League campaign. He played at least six games in every season including and between those two quarter-final appearances, failing to score only when Igor Biscan belittled him in 2004/05.",
      "But it was neither injury nor under-performance that snapped that remarkable streak. Ibrahimovic instead vacated his seat at the European top table entirely of his own accord – by joining Manchester United.",
      "Louis van Gaal had sidestepped the first sign of the Pardpocalypse by quelling any Wembley dad dancing in the FA Cup final. The Dutchman also took Manchester United to within goal difference of the Champions League places but that was not enough and so Jose Mourinho was appointed. One of his first moves was to orchestrate the arrival of Ibrahimovic, who proceeded to talk the considerable talk while actually walking the quite brilliant walk.",
      "But the significant knee knack he suffered in the Europa League quarter-final meant he would play only one Champions League game for Manchester United. He holds the record of most different clubs represented in the European Cup at seven, even if his solitary match in the competition for the Red Devils was as a second-half substitute in defeat to Basel.",
      "",
      "3) N’Golo Kante\nA peculiar set of circumstances meant the £30m departure of the midfielder most vital to a Premier League title win for a team that had finished 10th passed by without much consternation or controversy.",
      "Leicester resigned themselves to the idea that Kante would be the first noteworthy cab off the King Power rank and Chelsea duly obliged after Arsenal pulled out of the running over seemingly extortionate agent fees.",
      "Kante thus had to wait until September 2017 for his first taste of the Champions League, missing out on Leicester’s journey to the quarter-final the previous year and instead busying himself winning a consecutive Premier League title. The Frenchman would claim his European Cup by 2021 as man of the match in the final, cementing a legacy of making up for lost time and receiving the ultimate award for what was quite the leap of faith five years previous.",
      "Chelsea were out of European competition completely but still signed the epitome of a Champions League calibre player as Kante called “the opportunity to work with Antonio Conte, a brilliant coach… simply too good to turn down”.",
      "It is unknown if he felt the same way about Frank Lampard.",
      "",
      "2) Angel di Maria\nHe was an ill fit, a ‘complete fanny’, the polar opposite to what his manager sought and emblematic of a period during which the club favoured style over substance in the transfer market. Manchester United made a loss on Di Maria less than a year after his purchase for good reason.",
      "But it was a monumental capture at the time, albeit a flexing of superficial muscles to stroke an ego bruised by one failed post-Sir Alex Ferguson season. Manchester United finished the 2013/14 campaign in seventh and under the caretaker guidance of Ryan Giggs; Di Maria ended it as man of the match in the Champions League final and leading assist provider in La Liga with 18, having scored in a Copa del Rey final win over Barcelona.",
      "The closest he ever got to playing European football for the Red Devils was the trip to lose 2-1 to Swansea in February 2015 before departing for Paris Saint-Germain that August.",
      "",
      "1) Paul Pogba\nThe world-record fee was used as a stick with which critics could relentlessly beat the haircut out of Pogba. His reign as the most expensive footballer ever lasted a solitary year before Neymar made the £89.3m Manchester United paid Juventus look like a Willian Prunier clean sheet bonus. Yet often forgotten is one of the many wrinkles in that deal: the pull of home, Mourinho or infuriating Graeme Souness on a weekly basis persuaded one of the best young players around to abandon a recent Champions League finalist and serial Serie A title winner for whatever state Van Gaal left Old Trafford in.",
      "It was believed at the time that Real Madrid were the favourites – proving one immutable transfer truth – but when Los Blancos withdrew from the race over money, it was time to dust off Stormzy for the unveiling.",
      "From December 2015 to September 2017, Manchester United’s last chapter in their estimable European Cup history was to bring on Nick Powell against Wolfsburg. In between, they spent more on a player than any team ever before. Pogba remains the last player to open the scoring in a winning continental final for the club, putting Ajax to the Europa League sword to ensure Champions League qualification for a club that finished seven points off fourth in his first season.",
      "Pogba had his pick of clubs as a precocious and prodigious 23-year-old; both he and Manchester United might choose differently if given the option again.",
      "READ NEXT: Manchester United above Newcastle, Spurs, Atletico in ranking of transfer allure to new signings",
      "Man Utd should make move to re-sign former Red Devils midfielder Paul Pogba as they can’t “afford not to consider a move”, according to Dwight Yorke.",
      "Liverpool have been linked with a British record £126m move for Florian Wirtz, which will push Man Utd and Chelsea embarrassments down the list.",
      "With Trent Alexander-Arnold confirming his exit from Liverpool this summer, we look at the most valuable of all free transfers.",
      "Liverpool’s Trent Alexander-Arnold is off to Real Madrid. Naturally, we have picked the biggest free transfer departure for each Premier League club.",
      "According to reports, Manchester United are already ‘advancing’ to secure their first summer signing ahead of a major squad overhaul.",
      "Paul Pogba could play in the United States before making a ‘big jump’ to a European club in the summer, according to reports in France."

He didn’t get much of a chance and was sold to Birmingham City for £1.5m after a successful year on loan before getting his chance in the Premier League with Luton Town, who he did quite well for.",

      "",

      "He scored in a Europa League final victory for United. He also scored a scorpion kick (that would not have counted in the VAR era). Anything good he did for the club was eclipsed by the woeful swap deal which saw him go to Arsenal.",

      "39) Hannibal Mejbri (£9m) (18)\nBought from Monaco in 2019, Mejbri spent the 22/23 campaign on loan at Birmingham and wasted the second half of last season on loan at Sevilla. He is now at Burnley in the Championship.",

      "35) Tyrell Malacia (£13m) (15)\nMalacia quickly shifted Luke Shaw out of the starting XI before generously giving his spot back to the England international. Not a good signing, even for the price.",
      "",
      "34) Joshua Zirkzee (£36.5m) (26)\nZirkzee has had a horrible time of it since moving to Old Trafford from Bologna last summer. Ruben Amorim hung him out to dry with his first-half substitution against Newcastle. He actually bounced back pretty well but it would be very generous to say he looks like he belongs.",
      "",

      "32) Alex Telles (£13.5m) (14)\nTelles was decent when called upon but Erik ten Hag sent him out on loan to Sevilla in his first summer at Old Trafford. He joined Al Nassr permanently last July and is now playing for Botafogo.",
      "",
      "31) Marouane Fellaini (£29m) (26)\nFellaini was the first signing post-Ferguson after David Moyes bought him on deadline day for a higher price than the release clause that was active earlier in the window. He made 177 appearances for the Red Devils before leaving for Shandong Taishan in 2019.",
      "",
      "30) Anthony Martial (£54m) (12)\nMartial joined as the most expensive teenager in world football, scored a wonderful goal on his debut and was being compared to Thierry Henry. He scored 17 goals in 32 Premier League matches in 19/20 and looked like he was coming of age. After that terrific year, he looked slow and poor in front of goal.",
      "After an underwhelming loan spell at Sevilla, Ten Hag gave Martial another chance with his fitness letting him down. He joined AEK Athens on a free transfer in September.",

      "",
      "25) Aaron Wan-Bissaka (£49.5m) (40)\nWan-Bissaka was one of Erik ten Hag’s biggest success stories at Man Utd. The right-back enjoyed a very productive 22/23 campaign but was never able to usurp Diogo Dalot and his transfer fee will always look very silly.",
      "",
      "24) Matthijs de Ligt (£38.4m) (24)\nAjax, Juventus, Bayern Munich, Manchester United. Matthijs de Ligt has an impressive CV. An impressive CV is one thing, performing on the pitch is another.",
      "",
      "23) Raphael Varane (£36m) (7)\nVarane failed to convince everyone that he is in fact a four-time Champions League winner in his time at Old Trafford. Injuries absolutely did not help but what a disappointment he was.",
      "The Frenchman joined Cesc Fabregas’ Como in the summer and swiftly retired after suffering another serious injury.",

      "22) Sergio Romero (free) (8)\nAs far as back-up goalkeepers go, Romero was pretty good. And he cost bugger all, which is always a bonus.",
      "",
      "21) Andre Onana (£45.2m) (11)\nUpgrading on David de Gea should have been Ten Hag’s top priority when he took over and it took him a year to realise the Spaniard needed to be replaced. Do not be blinded by his 2022/23 Golden Glove.",
      "We thought Onana would be a big upgrade on De Gea but that’s not been the case. He makes far too many errors and his distribution is shaky, despite that being a compelling reason for ditching DDG for him.",

      "20) Jonny Evans (free) (38)\nIt is hilarious how high Evans is here. Genuinely astounding.",
      "",
      "19) Leny Yoro (£52m) (12)\nYoro’s potential is astronomical but that was a debut season to forget.",
      "",
      "18) Marcel Sabitzer (loan) (21)\nAs far as half-season emergency loans go, this was a success. Ten Hag decided against signing Sabitzer on a permanent basis. Silly man.",

      "",
      "15) Juan Mata (£40m) (15)\nDavid Moyes’ second major signing after Fellaini, Mata joined from Chelsea with high expectations. The Spaniard played 285 times for the Red Devils, with game time hard to come from the start of 20/21 up until his departure in June 2022.",
      "",
      "14) Fred (£53m) (10)\nA few years ago Fred was in the same bracket as Lukaku, Pogba, and others as the big-money flops. But the Brazilian midfielder massively improved in his last two years at the club.",
      "£53m is still pretty bloody steep, mind.",
      "",
      "13) Christian Eriksen (free) (4)\nA lot of us fancied Eriksen to be the bargain of the 2022/23 campaign and his transfer fee – or lack of – is doing a lot of heavy lifting. Will leave for nothing this summer.",
      "",
      "12) Edinson Cavani (free) (9)\nSeventeen goals in 39 games in his first season was a great return from a player signed on a free transfer. He was rewarded with a new contract before Man Utd bought Cristiano Ronaldo, which screwed the Uruguayan over.",
      "",
      "11) Amad Diallo (£19m) (19)\nAfter a rubbish loan spell with Rangers, Diallo was being written off by many (myself included). However, his time with Sunderland was superb with the young Ivorian increasing his transfer value and staking a claim for minutes in the Premier League.",
      "His transfer fee could rise to £37m, which is beginning to look like decent value for money…finally.",
      "",
      "10) Lisandro Martinez (£50m) (5)\nMartinez is a fine footballer who adapted to Premier League life very quickly despite being written off before kicking a ball because of his height. The Argentine World Cup winner attracted interest from Arsenal before joining the Red Devils and it is clear to see why. His return from injury at the end of 2023/24 helped Ten Hag win the FA Cup.",
      "",
      "9) Ander Herrera (£32m) (6)\nHerrera was named Manchester United Fans’ Player of the Season in 2017 after he helped them win the League Cup and Europa League. He played 189 times for the Red Devils and was a fan favourite due to his passion, tireless work rate, and man-marking techniques; just ask Eden Hazard.",
      "",
      "8) Noussair Mazraoui (£12.8m) (17)\nHe is comfortably the best signing Man Utd made last summer.",
      "",
      "7) Cristiano Ronaldo (£13.5m) (4)\nThere’s not a lot to say that has not already been said. £13.5m for the most marketable footballer on the planet isn’t too bad at the end of the day. Even if it ended up turning into the biggest circus in world football.",
      "",
      "6) Casemiro (£61.5m) (3)\nAfter spending the whole 2022 summer transfer window chasing Frenkie de Jong, Man Utd realised that Casemiro was sitting right there willing to slot straight into their midfield.",
      "This is such a weird one now. In his debut season, Casemiro was outstanding and the main reason Ten Hag was able to end the club’s trophy drought and finish third in the Premier League, which is why he is so high here.",
      "In his second season, the Brazilian was awful. He looked remarkably off the pace and Man Utd prayed a Saudi Arabian club would bail them out in the summer.",
      "And then in 2024/25, he was one of Amorim’s better players. Funny ol’ game, innit?",
      "At this stage, the Red Devils shouldn’t be too bothered about what transfer fee they get; it’s all about getting Casemiro’s monstrous contract off the books. We’re not sure Saudi Arabia are even that stupid.",
      "",
      "5) Luke Shaw (£33.7m) (3)\nFitness issues and injuries have been the bane of Shaw’s Manchester United career.",
      "",
      "4) Diogo Dalot (£19.8m) (13)\nDalot’s time at the club looked up in the summer of 2021 with Jose Mourinho’s AS Roma circling, however, he has since established himself as the club’s first-choice right-back ahead of Wan-Bissaka, before it became the flip of a coin for Ten Hag.",
      "",
      "3) Alejandro Garnacho (£400k) (10)\nWhat a bargain and Man Utd intend to make some lovely profit in the summer.",
      "",
      "2) Zlatan Ibrahimovic (free) (2)\nThis is arguably the first signing on this list which was/has been a huge, unqualified success at Old Trafford. It only took 63 players to get here but at least we did.",
      "Zlatan scored 28 goals and provided 10 assists in his only full season, helped the Red Devils win the Europa League and scored a brace in the final of the League Cup as they beat Southampton 3-2 at Wembley. In 17/18, he struggled for fitness and left for LA Galaxy, for whom he scored 22 goals in 27 games in the same campaign.",
      "",
      "1) Bruno Fernandes (£56.7m) (1)\nAlthough his performances are not as good as they were during the behind-closed-doors days, Bruno Fernandes has been a revelation at Old Trafford. In his first season and a half, Fernandes provided 65 goal contributions in 80 games and was the best player in Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s side by a country mile.",
      "He is one of the best midfielders in the Premier League and a rare bit of great business by the Red Devils. It will take a lot to bump him off top spot – especially after he proved his loyalty by snubbing silly Saudi Arabian money to stay.",
      "In which the Mirror do weird things with Bruno Fernandes quotes both ancient and modern, Florian Wirtz is absolutely furious and Mary Earps should be more like Joe Root.",
      "Man Utd are desperate to offload Jadon Sancho this summer and have offered him as part of a swap deal for a West Ham star, according to reports.",
      "Bruno Fernandes has revealed that a request from Manchester United manager Ruben Amorim was one of the main factors in him rejecting a move to Al Hilal.",
      "Mikael Silvestre has given his verdict on what needs to happen next with Man Utd manager Ruben Amorim and captain Bruno Fernandes.",
      "Jadon Sancho will return to Man Utd this summer after Chelsea paid the £5m penalty to cancel their obligation to buy the winger, according to reports.",

      "Three of those players subsequently had their contracts terminated early, while Lacazette was at least allowed to see out his Arsenal deal before leaving on a free transfer when it expired. Presumably that’s why they have not signed a decent striker since.",

      "Add-ons make things a little murky – Watkins has surely achieved his while Buendia has not – but the total value of the package to bring in Diaby was in a different market to where Villa usually deal. They then somehow sold the Frenchman for a profit, which allowed them to break their transfer record for the Everton and Belgium midfielder.",

      "Brilliant as Brighton are, their transfer strength has been in identifying rough diamonds from faraway lands to polish and move on for considerable profit rather than spending big. Pedro might be the exception as Brighton could pretty much double their money on the Brazilian, but Rutter’s first season was underwhelming.",

      "The first two of those names left for nothing, so Burnley bucked the trend by at least securing a hefty profit for Wood.

      "Bruno Fernandes has revealed that a request from Manchester United manager Ruben Amorim was one of the main factors in him rejecting a move to Al Hilal.",
      "Fernandes was one of the only standout performers in the United side last season. He was the top scorer in the Premier League, where the Red Devils finished 15th, and in all competitions, he was directly involved in 38 goals.",
      "He recently reiterated his commitment to United, but that was put to the test by interest from Saudi Arabian side Al Hilal, who were willing to pay him a big sum of money to join.",
      "Fabrizio Romano revealed on June 3 that Fernandes had decided against the move, as he wanted to continue playing at the top level in Europe.",
      "Now, Fernandes has revealed manager Amorim had a big say in his decision.",
      "“There was an opportunity. The [Al Hilal] president called me and asked if I wanted to go there,” Fernandes said.",
      "“They were waiting for me. I spoke to coach Amorim. He asked me not to go.",
      "“Manchester United didn’t want to sell me. They don’t need the money. If I had wanted to leave, they would have made it happen.",
      "“Al Hilal were very kind. They spoke to my agent. Then I spoke to my wife. She asked: ‘What do you want to do?’ She always supports my decisions.",
      "“It would have been easy to move there. I know the Portuguese players there very well. But I want to play at the highest level and compete for major titles.",
      "“I can do that, and I still want to. I’m very passionate about football.”",
      "Amorim was adamant about Fernandes’ position at United in March, when there was a suggestion that Real Madrid could look to sign him.",
      "He said: “No, it’s not going to happen. He’s not going anywhere because I’ve already told him.”",
      "Indeed, it looks as though Amorim has got his way, with the huge riches at Al Hilal failing. Whether a big European side approaching for Fernandes would have an impact is a different story, but Amorim would clearly be against that.",
      "The midfielder was clearly happy to listen to his boss on this occasion, so United will hope any other approaches are met with the same mindset.",

      "It’s been stated the Bees could ask for a ‘higher fee’ from United, and what sort of fee that is has now been revealed.",
      "Indeed, The i Paper reports the London club wants to earn ‘in excess’ of £55million, and they have a basis for asking for north of that fee.",

      "However, United have been given a warning about Mbeumo’s price. It’s said that unless they pay the required fee, the transfer will ‘drag on all summer’.",
      "That Brentford never settled for less than they wanted for Ivan Toney suggests they’re ready to be stern and get their asking price.",

      "Ex-Arsenal defender Keown understandably isn’t convinced. Former Sporting CP boss Amorim hasn’t had a pre-season or a summer transfer window yet but United’s results do have to speak for themselves to some degree and finishing in the bottom six of the Premier League isn’t going to be anywhere near good enough next season.",
      "“I’m still concerned that maybe this isn’t the right manager for Manchester United,” Keown told talkSPORT. “Just look at the number of games they’ve lost.”",

      "Bryan Mbeumo will almost definitely be taking a step down to complete his dream move to Manchester United, and few have done so at greater expense.",
      "Brentford forward Mbeumo has reportedly expressed his preference to join Ruben Amorim’s side and is unmoved by them being utter sh*te.",
      "He will not be the first to do so, nor the most expensive at around £50m. But he will find himself among these, the biggest ever signings involving a player joining a club lower in the Premier League.",
      "",
      "N’Golo Kante – £32m in July 2016",
      "From: Leicester (1st)\nTo: Chelsea (10th)",
      "It is not often a player can leave the popular, newly-crowned miracle champions for a loathed mid-table team with barely an eyebrow raised or an unkind word spoken. But the combination of Kante’s inherent likeability and the Freaky Friday scenario Leicester and Chelsea found themselves locked in a decade ago led to one of the strangest yet most straightforward transfers imaginable.",
      "Chelsea, at the start of their rebuild under Antonio Conte, faced basically no competition for very possibly the best player of the previous season, although Arsene Wenger inevitably fluttered his eyelashes and PSG sniffed around.",
      "Eight players moved to Premier League teams for bigger fees than Chelsea paid Leicester for Kante in the same summer. Arsenal spent more on Granit Xhaka, Spurs invested as much on Moussa Sissoko and Manchester United paid about three times more for Paul Pogba. Phenomenal work from all involved.",
      "",
      "Alex Iwobi – £34m in August 2019",
      "From: Arsenal (5th)\nTo: Everton (8th)",
      "Marco Silva kept a straight face when describing Iwobi as “one of our main targets”, despite the Toffees having to rush through a move in the final two hours of the 2019 transfer window after finally abandoning their summer-long pursuit of Wilfried Zaha.",
      "Iwobi’s future was intrinsically linked to that of the Crystal Palace talisman either way. The Nigerian said he would have to consider leaving Arsenal if Zaha joined the Gunners due to the added “stress” of competing for places, with that pressure enough to evoke panic even when it was only Nicolas Pepe who moved to north London.",
      "Everton had finished 16 points behind Arsenal but in the midst of a period of lavish spending reached up the table to make Iwobi the third-most expensive player in their history at the time.",
      "The gap was actually closed to seven points in 2019/20, with Iwobi a late substitute in an abysmal game watched from the stands by incoming managers Mikel Arteta and Carlo Ancelotti.",
      "",
      "Lewis Hall – £35m in July 2024",
      "From: Chelsea (6th)\nTo: Newcastle (7th)",
      "A slightly different case, Hall’s marriage with Newcastle was arranged when the Magpies were eight places higher than Chelsea, but by the time that loan was made permanent a year later the Blues were one position and three points ahead.",
      "It is unknown whether or indeed how many of the £7m add-ons included in the deal have been triggered, but more than 50 appearances, an actual trophy and a couple of England caps might leave Champions League qualification as the only box left unticked.",
      "",
      "Juan Mata – £37.1m in January 2014",
      "From: Chelsea (3rd)\nTo: Manchester United (7th)",
      "While Manchester United were officially Premier League champions for a little under four more soul-sapping months, their star had already fallen by the time Mata’s helicopter landed at Carrington.",
      "David Moyes welcomed the Spaniard with unsurprisingly open arms, hoping he could galvanise his fading first season at Old Trafford as Manchester United sat seventh, a point clear of Newcastle.",
      "Chelsea were third at the time the deal went through, much to the chagrin of Wenger. “Some teams have already played twice against one opponent and some others not. I think if you want to respect the fairness for everybody exactly the same, that should not happen.”",
      "He would loan Kim Kallstrom later that month in protest.",
      "Mata, on the other hand, will probably forever remain the top scorer of Ryan Giggs’ entire career as a club manager.",
      "",
      "Nemanja Matic – £40m in July 2017\nFrom: Chelsea (1st)\nTo: Manchester United (6th)",
      "The first of a great many awkward midfield keys signed to unlock Paul Pogba, it was Matic who Jose Mourinho described as having “everything he wants in a footballer” in what was presumably intended as a compliment but is actually a damning indictment beyond about 2015.",
      "Conte was furious and for once entirely justified as Chelsea used the funds to restock their cupboards with Tiemoue Bakayoko and Danny Drinkwater before Ross Barkley arrived in January.",
      "The Blues fell to fifth in what amounted to a solid title defence considering their previous efforts, beating Manchester United in the FA Cup final after Mourinho secured his self-identified greatest achievement of finishing second to Manchester City and waiting patiently for the title to be reallocated years later.",
      "",
      "Cole Palmer – £42.5m in September 2023",
      "From: Manchester City (1st)\nTo: Chelsea (12th)",
      "Enough steaming missiles have been launched at the walls of Stamford Bridge, Cobham and any other property Chelsea have sold to themselves over the years for some to stick. Yet Palmer is still probably the one unqualified success story for Clearlake’s recruitment strategy.",
      "How wasteful it would have been had he heard Pep Guardiola out and decided to stay at Manchester City on the promise of a steady increase in minutes. Palmer felt he was already better than the 13 starts afforded to him in two seasons as a first-teamer and backed himself for a lead role elsewhere instead of playing a part in a supporting cast.",
      "Chelsea provided that platform and their sole regret will be that Palmer’s contract only runs for another eight years.",
      "",
      "Kyle Walker – £53m in July 2017",
      "From: Tottenham (2nd)\nTo: Manchester City (3rd)",
      "The game went in the summer of 2017 and Walker was held responsible by many.",
      "The mere concept of a full-back being sold for upwards of £50m caused a thousand think-pieces about the sport’s spiralling finances, followed by weeks of introspection as everyone pondered what part they had played in this and how they could possibly have stopped it.",
      "Kyle Walker. £50m. Entire heads fell off across the country.",
      "Forgotten in the ensuing madness was the fact that Walker had ostensibly taken a step down. He helped Tottenham claim the Put The Pressure On Cup, securing his place in the PFA Team of the Year in the process, before being dropped by Mauricio Pochettino for the FA Cup semi-final, a north London derby and a match with Manchester United. Those seven minutes in a 2-1 win at White Hart Lane in May 2017 happened to mark Walker’s last in a Spurs shirt.",
      "The right-back joined Manchester City that summer – for £50m! – and immediately explained that he moved to a team which finished eight points behind Spurs and was knocked out in the last 16 of the Champions League in Pep Guardiola’s debut trophyless season “to go on and pick up silverware”.",
      "Walker will leave the Etihad this summer with 17 winner’s medals in eight years. Listen, fair play.",
      "",
      "Moises Caicedo – £115m in August 2023",
      "From: Brighton (6th)\nTo: Chelsea (12th)",
      "The Liverpool copium was remarkably strong when their ambitious midfield transfer overhaul was slightly undermined by the panicked £111m bid Chelsea duly hijacked with a £115m offer of their own shortly after.",
      "Their frustration and consternation was broadly understandable. Chelsea had just finished in the bottom half under Frank Lampard in what was until recently an unthinkably embarrassing crash through the glass ceiling the Big Six clubs installed long ago; there are two Europa League finalists who would take 12th right now.",
      "Liverpool were far from the peak of their powers, finishing fifth and suffering early exits from the three knockout competitions, but they had Jurgen Klopp and a clear plan moving forward.",
      "That centered around the midfield and when Jude Bellingham proved one immutable Real Madrid truth, the money the Reds put aside was thrown in the general direction of Caicedo. Brighton, who ended the 2022/23 just a place behind Liverpool, were happy enough to watch the auction unfold and escalate.",
      "Noni Madueke and Robert Sanchez are on a list of 14 players put up for sale by Chelsea this summer, and Cole Palmer has been tipped for a shock exit.",
      "Cole Palmer has spoken of his excitement to play in Chelsea’s Europa Conference League final amid heading praise on Enzo Maresca.",
      "It’s the final weekend of the season and that means permutations time as the European places are settled while Liverpool host a giant party.",
      "Liverpool have been linked with a British record £126m move for Florian Wirtz, which will push Man Utd and Chelsea embarrassments down the list.",
      "Fabrizio Romano has revealed that Manchester City want to sign a Newcastle star to replace one of their stalwarts for the Club World Cup and beyond.",
      "Mason Mount’s big night in Europe could spark a renaissance, with the Man Utd star and seven more Big Six strugglers set for an upturn next season…"

      "It’s high time for an update of the all-important F365 Premier League Mood Rankings, the deeply scientific and highly rigorous ordering of the 20 top-flight clubs based entirely on feels and vibes.",
      "Fun fact: Google’s AI overview once claimed this utter nonsense was compiled by a supercomputer, when it is in fact the work of a prick.",
      "Anyway, we were right about one thing last time: Spurs could only end the season in first or last. We’ll be honest, though, we are a bit surprised about which one it’s turned out to be. The good news is that Spurs are still Spurs, and thus are about to split their fanbase into two warring, furious tribes based on whether they make the absurd, unthinkable decision to keep Ange Postecoglou or the absurd, unthinkable decision to sack him.",
      "Either way, we’re extremely confident they’ll be 16th by August and 20th by October. Possibly in the actual league too.",
      "",
      "20) West Ham (10)\nA slight late rally – built entirely on taking handfuls of points off entirely distracted Europa League finalists and relegated flotsam – has done little to lift the general mood of despair around the London Stadium, but if you squint hard enough it’s possible to imagine brighter times ahead.",
      "Graham Potter strikes us as a ‘needs a full pre-season’ kind of a manager. He’s the sort of manager they should have chosen in the first place when trying to draw a line under the David Moyes Era, rather than just getting someone who was very like David Moyes only more foreign and more emotional.",
      "Julen Lopetegui never looked like working out and West Ham p*ssed a season away because of it, and that was a shame because they did do some eye-catching transfer work last summer. It is still possible that it wasn’t a complete waste of time and we are not yet sure it’s right to rush to judgement on Potter. It’s still possible Brighton Potter is in there somewhere.",
      "But for now, it’s all guesswork and speculation after a miserable season that was supposed to signal the start of a new era. And there’s no point pretending that Tottenham winning a trophy isn’t a very annoying crowning turd in the Hammers’ overflowing bowl.",
      "",
      "19) Manchester City (17)\nNot winning the league is one thing, but not winning anything? That’s a problem. Dig deeper and it’s even worse, because they didn’t even really compete for anything other than the FA Cup.",
      "They were never in a title race, they stunk the Champions League out and lost to Spurs – what is it with City and Spurs? – in the early rounds of the Carabao. Only in the FA Cup did they even halfway resemble their old selves, staying upright as the other big beasts tumbled all around them, only to then lose to an inspired Crystal Palace in the final.",
      "Undoubtedly their worst and most difficult season since Pep Guardiola turned them into a trophy-gobbling machine, and the problem for City now is that doubt exists where no doubt existed before.",
      "Maybe they come back next season and win the league again. Maybe. But there’s no certainty anymore. You can’t even say with great conviction they’ll be in the title race.",
      "That itself is a wild situation to be in when you’re talking about a team that had won six of the last seven league titles before this season.",
      "They really were worse in just every way as well this year. Their fewest wins since 2015/16, most defeats, and fewest goals scored. The 44 goals they conceded was their worst since 2009/10 and the world was a very different place for City back then, right at the start of their journey to world domination.",
      "The team that won the lot is breaking up. Kyle Walker is gone, Kevin De Bruyne is gone. There are huge doubts over whether Guardiola himself has the drive or inclination or will to push through with the regeneration and build another great side. And if he doesn’t, what then?",
      "It’s all doubt and guesswork where previously there existed absolute certainty. And they’ve got to play in the Club World Cup.",
      "‘Oh no we didn’t win any trophies and only finished third and have to play in a Club World Cup’ are among the more first-world footballing problems imaginable, sure, but these things are all relative and this is a situation that City simply haven’t faced for several years now.",
      "",
      "18) Manchester United (15)\nAn absolute basket-case of a club who’ve just suffered the twin indignities of finishing an unthinkable 15th in the Premier League and losing an actual cup final to actual Spurs, but there’s no denying that their early summer transfer business is at the eye-catching end with Prem-proven arrivals confirmed (Cunha) and imminent (Mbeumo) from the sort of teams that have, uncomfortably, now become United’s direct rivals.",
      "Those are important moves not because they are good players who dramatically and necessarily improve United – although they are that – but because they serve as proof that for the time being at least this remains Manchester United Football Club We’re Talking About.",
      "United – or at the very least United wages – still have a pull that transcends their current status. And that offers meaningful hope that this absurd beast of a football club can still be brought to heel despite itself.",
      "The clock is ticking, though. We’re not entirely sure just how long United will remain a name that resonates so with players, but we do know that time is finite.",
      "We’ve already seen the United Will Get The Job Done In A Final myth utterly busted in Bilbao, but there’s no denying this swift summer foray into the transfer market is providing some repair to a deeply damaged brand.",
      "",
      "17) Arsenal (9)\nMust reluctantly accept the mantle of Banter Club and also acknowledge that they have largely brought it upon themselves.",
      "Finishing second again need not be disastrous, but there was definite regression and losing out to Liverpool rather than Man City makes life far harder for that particular breed of fan who refers to the club as ‘The Arsenal’ and believes they represent some bastion of class and heritage and history rather than just being another very rich football club that spends lots of money.",
      "The big problem for Arsenal is that they didn’t win anything. Again. The bigger problem is that somehow – ludicrous and ridiculous a freaky fluke as it may be – Spurs did. And that has shifted the dynamic of the north London scene, for now at least.",
      "It’s not fair, it’s not big and it’s certainly not clever but Arsenal have no choice but to swallow at least a year of ‘Worra trophy’ every time they start mouthing off about beating PSG on xG and such. They really are just going to have to take it, and while we are always reluctant to judge any fanbase by its most conspicuous online gobshites, it would massively help if they stop being very sniffy indeed about Spurs winning a competition – for a third time no less – that Arsenal themselves have never managed to win.",
      "The whole ‘who’s had a better season?’ debate is facetious and largely in bad faith. There’s a very coherent argument to make that neither Spurs nor Arsenal should want to swap with the other. After 17 years, a trophy moved the needle for Spurs in a way that no amount of process-trusting second-place finishes ever could, while there remains still the sense that Arsenal are building towards something big in a way that Spurs shithousing a European pot in their worst domestic season for over 40 years absolutely does not.",
      "But until and unless Arsenal arrive at their destination – and there are never any guarantees you’ll get there until you do – then they live in Banter Town. Only one road out of there, lads.",
      "READ: Man Utd, Man City and Arsenal fell so far short of every single target",
      "",
      "16) Brentford (12)\nDid some madly entertaining things this season, with the whole ‘winning all our home games but losing all our away games and then switching that around for no real reason’ bit one of our very favourites from this season.",
      "The run of home games late last year that produced five straight wins by scores of 5-3, 4-3, 3-2, 4-1 and 4-2 was sensational, as really was the fact that 4-2 win (over Newcastle no less) was in fact Brentford’s last home win for four months.",
      "All those lads from about eighth to 12th were good value this season, and the only real criticism of Brentford is that they so rigidly confined their sense of fun to league matters when they looked every inch the sort of side that could and should have put together some kind of run at at least one of the cups. Especially the way this season panned out for rogue winners of cups.",
      "Overall, though, an excellent season with good vibes. But while Brentford’s business model is one that doesn’t just cope with the loss of key assets but positively thrives on it, the idea of losing both Bryan Mbeumo and Thomas Frank in one summer would appear to be something that might stretch that beyond its elastic limit. The very real possibility of this coming to pass has to harsh the buzz a bit.",
      "",
      "15) Burnley (-)\nPerhaps the most interesting of the promoted teams. Think we all kind of know what to expect, to some degree, from the other two. Leeds should give it a proper go as one of few teams outside the now Settled Seventeen with the requisite heft to muscle their way into the closed shop. Sunderland should go down and suffer frequent heavy punishment for their Icarus-like ‘promoted a season too early’ folly.",
      "But what of Burnley? They are so different to the last Burnley team to come up, who did it playing glorious football that simply didn’t survive contact with the rarefied Barclays air. Now, though, they are a team led by Scott Parker, a man so haunted by a 9-0 humiliation at Liverpool when in charge of Bournemouth that he has simply vowed to never concede another goal ever again, even if that means – and last season it very often did – not scoring any either.",
      "Now the last couple of years have been filled with chat about the hubris of promoted teams, about their failure to be sufficiently humble to take their medicine and accept that what got them here can’t keep them here. That the way teams like Brentford or Brighton adapted to survive the transition to the far, far higher level is apparently now too much to ask of teams like Southampton, and especially Vincent Kompany’s Burnley.",
      "But what about this Burnley? They’ve sufferballed their way in, so could they now sufferball their way to 15th? It does feel more likely than trying to Temu Man City their way there like Kompany or Russell Martin.",
      "Yet at the same time it does also feel like they might just end up like Homer Simpson when he gets in the ring with Drederick Tatum. Premier League teams might not get tired. That cactus is right!",
      "",
      "14) Sunderland (-)\nAnother thrilling Championship play-off final, another big club with a proud history getting itself foolishly promoted when it is visibly and palpably unready.",
      "But those are concerns for far later in the summer. Let us not sully their celebratory moment with talk of it being another great chance for Derby to get their names out of the record books at long last.",
      "That kind of chat is for August, or perhaps late July. For now, the best advice for Sunderland would appear to be go Full Forest and sign a bunch of players and worry about the rules later. The alternative paths for a team that finished 24 points behind the other promoted teams are simply too ghastly to think about for long.",
      "",
      "13) Fulham (11)\nWe love Fulham. They have carved out a niche as the Premier League’s most reliable ‘can beat anybody, can lose to anybody’ team and it’s a tremendous way to go about 50-odd point-securing mid-table comfort.",
      "They are a team that often manages to get themselves on the edge of European talk around February or March only to be nowhere near it by May without anyone really noticing or complaining about how they fell off. Seems a nice way to live.",
      "Even the way this season ended was perfectly on brand, their European hopes fading away in accordance with the prophecy as they lost six of their last nine league games after a heavy FA Cup defeat to Palace.",
      "Obviously one of the nine games they didn’t lose was a 3-2 win over the champions – and this was at the start of April, weeks before Liverpool had officially wrapped up the title and gone full beach/flip-flop/cigars.",
      "Fulham this season managed to lose to Wolves, West Ham, Everton, and Manchester United, draw with Tottenham, Southampton and Ipswich (twice) and beat Newcastle (twice), Nottingham Forest (twice), Chelsea and Liverpool.",
      "Never change, lads. Never change.",
      "",
      "12) Bournemouth (8)\nUltimately finished second in the tremendously fun eighth-twelfth mini-league of enormously entertaining mid-table teams as Brighton pulled clear in the closing weeks to claim first place. Well, eighth place. But you know what we mean.",
      "Bournemouth, though, remain our favourite of this gaggle of teams that also contains Brentford, Fulham and Palace. There’s something similar going on at all these clubs, who have become the Premier League’s affluent and aspirational middle-class over the last couple of years as the league’s wealth has grown and their own status within it solidified.",
      "All of them are doing fine work in the crucial field of making mid-table life fun by being capable of going on wild runs of startling form at both ends of the spectrum, but Bournemouth are the ones for us who most conspicuously pass the eye test.",
      "There are two versions of this Bournemouth team under Andoni Iraola. The one that goes on 11-match unbeaten runs that includes smashing top-seven teams to absolute pieces in back-to-back games, and the team that wins one match in nine trying to remember what they were doing in the first bit.",
      "Bournemouth’s best football this season has been alarmingly close to the best football played by anyone this season, and that’s a wonderful thing. We’re not sure Iraola and this team will ever crack the code entirely and be able to turn those spells of seemingly effortless flow-state brilliance into an entire season but imagine if they did. Wouldn’t that be something, eh?",
      "",
      "11) Everton (7)\nNot as giddy now as in those early days of David Moyes’ return, but still far happier with their on-field lot than could possibly have been predicted halfway through the season.",
      "What makes Everton so hard to place now is how to weigh up the emotional wrench of leaving Goodison Park after over a century of memories and history versus the excitement of moving into their new ground and all the potential that brings.",
      "So what we’re going to do at this point is simply avoid that kind of complicated brain-melter altogether and simply put them right there in the middle. And there’s nothing you can do about it.",
      "",
      "10) Brighton\nFinished the season like an absolute train to finish one place and in the end just four points behind a stumbling Nottingham Forest. Always bittersweet when you end a season like that.",
      "Sure, it’s never a bad thing to end on a high note and approach the summer with confidence for the next but at the same time Brighton ended the campaign sufficiently clear of their fellow entertaining mid-table chums (your Bournemouths, your Brentfords, the Fulhams of this world) and sufficiently close to the European spots that you can’t help but look wistfully at things like drawing six (and losing the other two) in an eight-game run around Christmas last year or even April’s failure to secure more than a single point from three games against Palace, Leicester and Brentford.",
      "Overall, though, eighth place in the Premier League and genuine reason to believe Fabian Hurzeler’s second season can be even better than his first with that vital year’s worth of experience means the vibes on the south coast are very good indeed.",
      "",
      "9) Nottingham Forest (2)\nAh, the cruelty of shifting expectations. Let’s be real here, it’s still been an extraordinary season for Forest, who went from relegation battlers last season to spending much of this campaign on the fringes of the title race before falling away on the finishing straight to end ‘only’ seventh.",
      "It’s just human nature that doing it that way doesn’t feel quite as good as surging up to pinch seventh and a European spot after spending most of the season in 12th.",
      "But while there will be some fans for whom only being in the Europa Conference represents the sky falling in, the vast majority of fans will, we suspect, see the bigger picture here. Not least the fact they now find themselves in a competition that offers a huge chance of adding a new chapter to a storied European history at the City Ground.",
      "",
      "8) Wolves (13)\nWere briefly and giddily the best team in the land for a while there, winning six straight games between mid-March and the end of April, at which point a far loftier mood position appeared on the cards with Vitor Pereira getting an absolute tune out of what turned out to be a far more talented squad than Gary O’Neil had made us all think,",
      "But one point from their last four games is a familiar damp squib of a season end for a team that has history for allowing the way one season ends to bleed into how the next begins.",
      "Another slow start and more managerial uncertainty in the early months of next season really would be annoying when it looked like they really might hit the summer with proper momentum.",
      "Losing Matheus Cunha is no shock to anyone, but a massive blow nonetheless. Especially with him making such a sideways move to Man United.",
      "",
      "7) Aston Villa (5)\nSimmering resentment over the manner of missing out on Champions League qualification on the final day should ultimately give way to acknowledgement that sixth probably represents a fair enough reflection of their overall league season and is a decent enough effort when combined with a fine run on their return to European football’s top table.",
      "They have got their feet back under the table now as a big deal in the Premier League and there is an obvious silver lining for any good Premier League team that finds itself narrowly missing out on the Champions League and finding itself instead in the Europa: that is now an enormously winnable trophy, and one that needn’t be a massive drain on the first half of your season given the fact even Spurs and United were largely able to coast into cosy top-eight finishes.",
      "A quick glance at the current confirmed qualifiers suggests precious little to fear for a team coming off an impressive Champions League run, let’s put it that way.",
      "We understand why, obviously, clubs want to be in the Champions League for the money and the prestige and did we mention money, but if you’re a fan of a club like Aston Villa then the idea of a proper run at winning the Europa has to appeal.",
      "",
      "6) Chelsea (14)\nCompleting the new full set of European trophies and becoming the first team to do so is a neat result for completionists everywhere.",
      "Being the first to do something is always a buzz because while others can eventually match the achievement, nobody else can ever be first. And probably nobody will match it for ages anyway; who knows how long it might be before Man United can lift themselves back to the level of qualifying for the Conference League to have a crack themselves?",
      "If winning the third-tier European comp was a bit of a penalty kick and in fact the only way to avoid embarrassment in that competition, getting themselves back in the top four after some difficult Premier League campaigns was something with a bit more bite, even if the title challenge promised in the early months of the season faded away to nothing in the end.",
      "We are still in the realm of bare-minimum achievement for a club that has spent such hilarious amounts on compiling their squad, but it’s also a bare minimum that has not been met for a while now.",
      "We remain powerfully unconvinced by Enzo Maresca, but it’s hard to view the season just gone as anything other than one that has demonstrably placed Chelsea closer to where they ought to be and for his first year that was enough. It wouldn’t be enough next season, though, and having to actually deploy first-team players throughout a European campaign obviously represents a fresh challenge.",
      "",
      "5) Leeds (-)\nPromoted in often scintillating style and, whether anyone else likes it or not, are one of vanishingly few Championship clubs for whom a meaningful stab at breaking open the Premier League’s Settled Seventeen represents a realistic ambition and not just a hopeful pipe dream.",
      "Still need a big and busy summer to have anything like a squad ready to cope with what the Premier League has become even since their last crack at it, but a real sense that Leeds are ready to give it a go.",
      "Very much still in the celebratory partying stage of the Premier League promotion cycle and while The Fear will kick in for them as it does for everyone at some point, how Leeds go next season does feel like it’s an important barometer of the wider health of the upper levels of the English football pyramid; if Leeds disappear without a trace then the question becomes who, if anyone, won’t do that?",
      "And if the only viable answers there become Birmingham, or Wrexham, then you’re really just raising further uncomfortable questions.",
      "Tits to all that for now, though, yeah? Leeds are back. They’re pretty chuffed about it, and don’t really care whether anyone else is.",
      "",
      "4) Liverpool (6)\nSome fans deciding to be a bit weird about Trent Alexander-Arnold is so not rainbow rhythms and the fact Liverpool didn’t win another game after confirming the league title is all at the same time a) funny b) largely irrelevant but also c) slightly annoying.",
      "We’re all of us bedevilled by recency bias and while of course Liverpool fans are mainly still celebrating their first league title in front of fans since 1990, there’s a part of all of us that knows were we in their position we’d still be slightly narked about the four-game winless run to end the season even though logically we shouldn’t give a sh*t.",
      "This is very small beer, though, especially with the club already making statement moves in what is going to be a huge summer that will reveal whether Arne Slot can be as successful with his own side as he was with Jurgen Klopp’s.",
      "Jeremie Frimpong and especially the seemingly imminent Florian Wirtz are hugely exciting moves. Wirtz in particular is a massive statement of intent and indicator of how big Liverpool’s pull now is. If you’re not getting giddy about that one, you’re in the wrong game.",
      "",
      "3) Newcastle (1)\nNewcastle absolutely should not, will not and do not care one jot, but it’s very funny to us that the English football media collectively wanked themselves so entirely dry at Newcastle finally winning a trophy only for two other conspicuous pot-dodgers to collect two even bigger prizes before the season was out.",
      "Like we say, though: amusing to us, irrelevant to Newcastle. The cathartic release of all those long-awaited trophy wins was magical for those involved, and there really is no need for anything so gauche as comparisons or guff about who it meant more for.",
      "Newcastle backing up that emotional Carabao success by claiming fifth place and with it Champions League football next season places this at the summit of Newcastle seasons in the modern era and there really is no obvious reason why it shouldn’t now be just the start of something even greater.",
      "The mood is good, is what we’re saying here. Or it was until they realised they still couldn’t beat Manchester United to transfers.",
      "",
      "2) Crystal Palace (4)\nFifty points and an FA Cup win? They really are glad all over. We know we’re probably the only ones on earth who would put those achievements in that order, but we’ve been very invested in the Palace 50 points story for the last couple of years and are absolutely delighted to see them do it.",
      "But even we can acknowledge that getting 50 Premier League points in a season for the first time is not quite as good as winning major silverware for the very first time.",
      "In a season of remarkable drought-ending trophy success, nothing was greater than Palace’s. These were supporters with powerful reason to think this was a day that might never come, at least not in their lifetimes.",
      "The appointment of Oliver Glasner already merits discussion among the most astute managerial appointments any Premier League club has ever made. He came to a club with some compelling raw materials but has had a transformative effect few could have predicted.",
      "Are we still talking about FA Cup wins or are we back banging on about getting 50 points? We prefer not to speak.",
      "",
      "1) Tottenham (20)\nThey really are That Club, ending the trophy drought but absolutely not their banter era in the single most Spurs way imaginable.",
      "It is ridiculous to even imagine a team that finishes 17th qualifying for the Champions League, but when you do give it any kind of attention it immediately becomes clear only one club could possibly do it and that’s the one that didn’t qualify for the Champions League when they finished fourth.",
      "Only Spurs could achieve something like that after a decade of agony and then get about 10 days to fully enjoy and revel in no longer being the butt of everyone’s jokes – a mantle which, to make things even better, passed immediately to Arsenal – before going ‘Hang on, what do we actually do about a manager who won a trophy but also finished 17th?’",
      "Other clubs just aren’t like this.",
      "The genius of this Spurs season is just how long it’s been so clear that it had only two possible end-points. The miracle is which one has actually happened. We said this in March and apart from failing to mention Palace in the FA Cup it still captures the essence of the absurdity that is Tottenham’s 24/25 season:",
      "There remains, somehow, the small but decidedly non-zero chance that Postecoglou pulls an absolute Homer and wins the Europa League. It’s impossible to overstate just how much that transforms everything about this season.",
      "It might not be the most important thing about it, but we do think there are only two places Spurs can end the season in these rankings, and those two places are first and last.",
      "This is a season that for Spurs really does appear to have crystallised and distilled down to two possible outcomes. First, and most likely, their worst season since before the Premier League And The Invention Of Football. When you consider just how utterly crap Spurs were for much of the nineties and early noughties, that’s a staggering achievement.",
      "But not as staggering as the only alternative which is an end to their own trophy drought and with it qualification for the Champions League, which would genuinely make this Spurs’ best season for at least 40 years.",
      "Spurs’ existential despair over that albatross of a trophy drought has already been exacerbated by Newcastle exorcising their own demons, and with every chance of Villa, Bournemouth, Forest, Brighton or somesuch also joining the ever-growing list of clubs to win a trophy more recently than Tottenham there is a profound sense that while it’s always true that whatever happens in football the joke is always on Spurs it may never have been more true, the joke never more entirely on them, than it has been this season.",
      "Unless, of course, they can somehow defy history, logic and reason to land an unlikely punchline of their own. Mate.",
      "And lo, it came to pass. And now we have to get this out quick before Spurs make a confirmed final decision one way or the other on Big Ange and p*ss off half the fanbase either way."

      "Mikael Silvestre has admitted Manchester United will need ‘more than two or three years’ to emerge from their slump, as he gave his verdict on what needs to happen next with manager Ruben Amorim and captain Bruno Fernandes.",
      "The United boss is under huge pressure after failing to make a positive impact since succeeding Erik ten Hag as United boss last November, with defeat against Tottenham in the Europa League final providing a miserable footnote to the club’s worst season in a generation.",
      "United appear to have gone backwards since Amorim’s arrival and the Portuguese tactician has given public hints that he is willing to walk away from the club if the owners have lost faith in his abilities.",
      "Yet Silvestre, who won the Premier League title four times and also the Champions League during his time as a United player, has insisted Amorim should not be the fall guy for United’s demise.",
      "“These questions about Amorim’s future are complete nonsense because he took over in November and this is not his team,” Silvestre told Football365 with Esports Insider.",
      "“He has not had any time to influence his philosophy and how he wants to play and these are not the players he wants.",
      "READ: Man Utd signing £365m Premier League sextet now inevitable after Cunha, Mbeumo transfers",
      "“They are not his players. The only player they signed in January was Patrick Dorgu and now Amorim has to be given the time and the financial backing to strengthen the squad.",
      "“After that, we can judge what he doing. It will always be the results that decide what happens to a manager, but you cannot decide after half a season when he has not had a transfer window to fix it. We can only stick with him for the future.”",
      "Silvestre went on to express his hope that rumours linking United captain Bruno Fernandes with a move to the Saudi Pro League will evaporate, as the Frenchman insists the club need to hang on to their best player.",
      "Fernandes’ body language on the field has been criticised by former United players like Roy Keane, but Silvestre offers up a different verdict on the impact of the Portuguese playmaker.",
      "“There is no argument about Bruno’s commitment and level,” stated Silvestre. “The amount of football he has played this season shows a level of dedication and he has been their best player, for sure.",
      "“I hope Bruno stays because it is important that the top players are there to maintain the level and allow others to grow.",
      "“You look at someone like Kobi Mainoo and who is he going to look up to? It’s Bruno. He will learn from his movement and his passing. So it is really important that Bruno stays.”",
      "Silvestre went on to suggest United’s dramatic fall from grace has been hard to watch, as he admits last season’s FA Cup final win against Manchester United papered over cracks at the club, as he hinted they will many years to find a solution.",
      "“It’s shocking to see United where they are,” said Silvestre. “You do not expect a club of that stature to finish in this position in the league, but this has been coming. It has been mismanaged for many years and eventually it catches up with you.",
      "“When you ask how long they need to put it right, I’m going to say many years. I’m going to say more than two or three years. United have been standing still for too long and everyone else has been getting stronger.",
      "“Let’s see what Amorim can do. He needs at least three transfer windows in the summer to see if he can build a team, but it is a long time before they start to move up the ladder again.",
      "“The FA Cup final result (beating Manchester City) last season disguised the real position, but I still feel this team had more in the tank to finish a lot higher than they did this season.”",
      "In which the Mirror do weird things with Bruno Fernandes quotes both ancient and modern, Florian Wirtz is absolutely furious and Mary Earps should be more like Joe Root.",

      "Wednesday 4 June 2025 14:03, UK",
      "Manchester United's road back has begun.",
      "For all the disappointment of last season's 15th place finish and no trophies to soften the blow, there have been some early - albeit minor wins - off the pitch.",
      "Matheus Cunha's move from Wolves has been announced. But the forward is not the only attacking talent still keen for Ruben Amorim's project. Bryan Mbeumo's decision to pursue an Old Trafford move from Brentford - despite other elite clubs in the running - is a positive sign.",
      "Captain Bruno Fernandes has turned down the temptation of a money-fuelled Saudi Arabia move that could have given United more money to rebuild the team. The project is far from being alive again, but it's a start.",
      "\"Cunha and Mbeumo have Premier League experience, and are the right type,\" said Gary Neville. But that is not the only reason those two have been categorised as the answer to United's problems.",
      "Putting the ball in the back of the net proved to be an issue for United last season. They ranked sixth for chances created but finished second bottom for converting shots into goals, while they were also fourth bottom for shot accuracy.",
      "Overall, United failed to score in 15 Premier League matches last season - only relegated Southampton and Leicester managed more. Eleven of those matches were under Amorim.",
      "They also had the second-worst Expected Goals underperformance record in the division, with the numbers saying they should have scored at least nine more goals than their final league tally of 44.",
      "This is where Cunha and Mbeumo could help - if last season's performances are anything to go by.",
      "As United floundered in front of goal, Mbeumo was the league's best overperformer in terms of xG. Using the same process as above, the Bees forward scored seven more goals than he should have done, with Cunha ranking third in the same category.",
      "Cunha and Mbeumo could therefore bring that clinical edge that United are missing. But would they go straight into the team - and if so, where?",
      "Amorim has repeatedly said he will not deviate from his way of playing via the 3-4-2-1 formation. The plus point for Cunha is that Vitor Pereira used the same system at Wolves in the second half of last season.",
      "Cunha turned out in the 'left No 10' role in Pereira's system and while the forward's 15-goal league season saw him strike consistently across the campaign, it arguably hit top gear under Pereira.",
      "Cunha scored in Pereira's first two matches in charge from that position, while he then hit five goals across seven straight games between the start of February and April.",
      "The issue with Cunha playing that role in United colours? Bruno Fernandes. He is the most common appearance maker in that role for Amorim.",
      "The United captain ended the season a little bit deeper, actually playing as one of the two sitting midfielders, with Mason Mount taking that 'No 10' role ahead of him. It was that same set-up when United lost the Europa League final to Spurs.",
      "But is it so simple that Fernandes will settle for the deeper role and Cunha sits in front of him? Firstly, there are doubts about the balance of United's team, but there is a heavier dilemma at play.",
      "At Sporting, that same No 10 role belonged to Pedro Goncalves, also known as Pote. He was not necessarily the star of the team but very much the attacking engine of it.",
      "While players like Viktor Gyokeres took the headlines, Pote engineered a lot of the attacking combinations - he got 30 goals and 27 assists during the final 73 league games of Amorim's Sporting era.",
      "So that pocket of attacking space often belongs to the important cog of Amorim's team. The United head coach will need to determine whether that position at Old Trafford belongs to Fernandes or Cunha.",
      "Like Cunha, Mbeumo will be looking to turn his upward trajectory into some early form at Old Trafford.",
      "Only Mohamed Salah won more points for his team from goals and assists than the Brentford forward. His goal contributions didn't just put him among the league's best in terms of numbers, but also as one of the division's best at deciding games when it matters.",
      "While Cunha is eyeing up that 'left No 10' role, Mbeumo will be targeting the spot on the right. Going back to his Sporting days, Amorim's system always had a right-footed natural winger playing in that role - with Marcus Edwards and Francisco Trincao among those options in Lisbon.",
      "At United, Mbeumo will want that position - but so will Amad Diallo. The 22-year-old has spent most of the Amorim era at United on the injury table but has briefly shown glimpses of being the shining light in this dark period for the club.",
      "His goal and assist to win the Manchester derby at rivals City came from that 'Right No 10' position, as did his start in the Europa League final defeat, where he looked like the only player capable of breaking the deadlock against the Spurs defence.",
      "So, two things could happen if Mbeumo completes his Old Trafford move. Either the load on young prodigy Amad is lessened and the two compete for the same role. Or Amad is shifted to right wing-back.",
      "In Amorim's United system, the wing-backs appear to be the most scrutinised area of the pitch, alongside the No 10s - but the pursuits of Cunha and Mbeumo are addressing those holes.",
      "United's inability to have recognised options in those positions was symbolised by the early acquisition of Patrick Dorgu in January, who may not be the finished article but at least fits the profile.",
      "In an era where transitions from one pitch to the other and open spaces in wide areas are pretty common, efficient wing-backs are vital in any system like Amorim's.",
      "That has not just been evident in Pereira's 3-4-2-1 system at Wolves, but also at Oliver Glasner's Crystal Palace side. The industrious running of Daniel Munoz and Tyrick Mitchell was a key feature in the Eagles winning the FA Cup and reaching Europe, a level that United would even take right now.",
      "Meanwhile United's wing-back options, despite having a lot of running to do, are not among the league's elite runners, with Amorim once citing a \"lack of urgency to defend or attack the box\" as a contributor to defeats.",
      "But Amad has shown he can operate in that wing-back role. Amorim's first four Premier League games at United saw the youngster start in that position - he got four assists in that run. After a period further forward, his next start at wing-back ended in a late hat-trick against Southampton.",
      "And in another throwback to Sporting, Amorim even played 17-year-old Geovany Quenda in that right wing-back role during his final few months at Lisbon, highlighting how he can give huge running responsibility to young and attack-minded shoulders.",
      "Cunha and Mbeumo's arrivals - one finalised and the other being plotted - are the first steps in United's blueprints in the bid to bounce back. They promise not only to change those two players' lives - but the responsibilities of those around them.",
      "Part of the reasoning for United going so many games without a goal was a lack of presence in the centre forward position.",
      "Rasmus Hojlund ended the season with the fewest shots and second-fewest Expected Goals per 90 out of any recognised forward in the Premier League last season. He also had 14 starts that failed to include a shot, while Amorim feels back-up Joshua Zirkzee is better off as a No 10 option.",
      "Both Cunha and Mbeumo share the same status when it comes to being a centre forward. They can do it if needed, but it's not their strong suit.",
      "Wolves boss Pereira confessed Cunha was not a striker last season, when he was forced to play in that role in moments when Jorgen Strand Larsen was struggling with fitness.",
      "Mbeumo - meanwhile - has played centrally before for Brentford and Thomas Frank has highlighted the Cameroon international's hold-up play as one of his strong suits. But his striker outings mainly came in a 3-5-2 set-up where he would work off Ivan Toney or Yoane Wissa, rather than be a focal point himself.",
      "United's pursuit of Liam Delap - who eventually chose Chelsea - demonstrated Amorim's desire to improve the centre forward area. While the club have got off to a good start in the window, there is still work to do.",
      "The summer transfer window will open again on Monday June 16 until Monday September 1 - with the deadline brought forward to 7pm this year"

      "\"I would worry that Villa haven't announced they're keeping him already, because that would be an easy deal to do with United if they were planning on keeping him.",
      "\"It sounds to me that Villa aren't going to keep him and he's going to end up back at United, but I hope for the club and Marcus' sake, it feels like that path has come to an end.\"",

There were players like Kleberson or Diego Forlan; it just didn't quite happen for them, but they had very good careers, by the way. Forlan was sensational in Spain, there are players who aren't suited to a league.",

      "\"I don't think that's going to happen this time. That's happened far too many times before, so I think Garnacho will leave just purely because of that.",
      "\"They've had enough. Garnacho can do it in the Premier League, but I think he'll thrive in Spain, he'll score goals and he'll be someone we'll be looking back at next season and asking: 'Why did Manchester United not keep him?'",

      "\"Mainoo is a step too far,\" Neville said.",
      "\"If we can't give Kobbie Mainoo a job in that two in midfield, a top club will want him. Why can't we make him a top player, if he's one of ours and is showing talent? I don't know what's going on there in the last few months, he's had some injuries that have caused him problems, so he needs to stay fit. But I'd like to feel he could be one of the two in midfield that United play.",
      "\"It's probably not Casemiro or [Manuel] Ugarte, it's probably someone else in there who is better than those two. We should be building around Mainoo in that midfield, not because he's come through the ranks. I'm alright for getting rid of players coming through the ranks, but not getting rid of players who come through the ranks and have shown what they can do.",
      "\"Marcus Rashford has been at the club a long time, Garnacho has had two or three years and there's a bit of a situation going on as well. But Mainoo is a no for me. He doesn't leave.\"",

      "Man Utd lost out on the signing of Liam Delap to Chelsea; they are at risk of losing Bruno Fernandes to Al Hilal; but have signed Matheus Cunha from Wolves; can Ruben Amorim offer something of a clean slate with signings suited to fit his style - or is the clean-up job simply too big?",
      "By Laura Hunter",
      "Tuesday 3 June 2025 08:51, UK",
      "Manchester United's peak powers of persuasion have long faded - but has the erosion been so protracted and so damaging that they have now lost all sense of appeal for players searching for their next big move?",
      "Back in early May, Man Utd were the club in pole position to sign sought-after striker Liam Delap from Ipswich. There were positive noises from Delap, too, thought to be open to playing under Ruben Amorim.",
      "But there was a catch. Delap's final decision was likely to be swayed by the glitz and glam of Champions League football, something Man Utd could not offer.",
      "In his own words, the forward, whose release clause is a modest £30m, chose Chelsea because of their style of play, as well as ambition to win things. Ouch.",
      "A bright, young English talent like Delap, who has connections to Manchester having spent five years at Man City, preferring to join Chelsea because the project has better immediate appeal will hurt Man Utd bosses. And so it should.",
      "Perhaps it's a timely reality check.",
      "United's place in the pecking order has tumbled over the past decade. Christopher Vivell and Jason Wilcox, the club chiefs shaping the recruitment strategy, are not permitted to fish in the same talent pools their predecessors once were. Economically and commercially, the club have fallen on much tougher times, no longer considered the destination club.",
      "Gone are the days where Europe's best players would scramble to sign for Man Utd. To represent one of the biggest, most successful footballing dynasties used to be a statement. A confirmation of elite.",
      "But modern-day Man Utd, the kind that finishes 15th in the Premier League and loses European finals to Tottenham, previously trophyless for 17 years, does not attract nor retain world-class talent.",
      "Former captain Roy Keane has been bullish in his belief that Man Utd's pulling power has all but disappeared: \"I think the days of everyone wanting to go to Manchester United are gone,\" he said in May.",
      "\"What are the positives with this team? You look at United and go, they're not really good at anything.\" Again, ouch.",
      "Bruno Fernandes being approached by Saudi Arabian club Al Hilal, whether a deal is struck or not, is symbolic of how far the Premier League's former leading force have fallen.",
      "If Fernandes were to leave, Amorim would not only lose his best player, but his captain too. And perhaps the only individual to emerge from this campaign of catastrophe with any grace. Few could have shouldered the turmoil with such defiance and poise.",
      "As Amorim has acknowledged: \"We need more Brunos.\" Imagine the impact of fewer?",
      "Of course, Man Utd have been beaten to big-name signings before. Eden Hazard famously chose Chelsea over Man Utd back in 2012 when Sir Alex Ferguson was still in charge, albeit he was nearing the end of his reign. Delap's snub won't define this next era. But recent market mishaps might.",
      "United have signed plenty of young talent in recent windows, all for inflated fees despite having no obvious competition for the player. Jadon Sancho, Antony and Rasmus Hojlund can all be categorised similarly, costing a combined total of £226m. They are worth a fraction of that now.",
      "The signing of 19-year-old defender Leny Yoro, widely considered to be one of the brightest young talents in the game, and pursued by both Real Madrid and Paris Saint-Germain, seemed to buck the trend last July.",
      "But that was before another season - their worst since suffering relegation in 1973/74 - unravelled so publicly. Attempting to replicate the same transfer coup has surely become infinitely harder, if not impossible.",
      "Amorim has been reluctant to sound the panic alarm, trying to rally with honest and heartfelt rhetoric, but even he looks drained by the monotony of underperformance and the turbulence that carries. Finding players suitable to the manager's requirements has got to be the overriding focus this summer. And yet, such a targeted approach to fit a very precise style brings with it its own risk.",
      "\"I'm not worried about the money, we are a big brand,\" Amorim said ahead of the Europa League final loss to Spurs.",
      "Surely Man Utd's status as a 'big brand' is under serious threat, though? This is a club unrecognisable from its Sir Alex heyday. Only a few weeks ago it was reported that INEOS boss Sir Jim Ratcliffe, who owns a 29 per cent stake, had seen his personal wealth drop by £6.5bn (a 25 per cent loss) since investing 18 months ago. This downward trajectory shows little sign of reversing.",
      "Amorim's firmness with Marcus Rashford meant United spent the second half of the season without their most experienced Premier League scorer. His 20-year United career looks to be finished. Sancho wants out permanently. Alejandro Garnacho has used social media to underline his determination to leave too.",
      "Ultimately, the hollowing out of United's core has been happening for years. There is nothing new about instability on the pitch or off it, nor player-manager spats that have further served to undermine - one might circle back to the Erik ten Hag vs Sancho saga, or Cristiano Ronaldo's messy exile before that.",
      "And yet, throughout all the upheaval and unrest, there are glimmers of promise. Man Utd have signed Matheus Cunha from Wolves. A good move on paper. Brentford's Bryan Mbeumo is reportedly open to the project too.",
      "There is still time for Yoro, and Manuel Ugarte and even Hojlund to come good.",
      "And they still possess one of the game's most highly thought of young coaches. Amorim has the unenviable job of knitting the past and present together to create something coherent before Man Utd can hope to make any real progress.",
      "A job easier said than done, but the alternative does not bear thinking about."

      "Matheus Cunha set for Man Utd after they triggered the £62.5m release clause in the Brazil international's contract at Wolves; despite interest from other clubs, Cunha wanted to play at Old Trafford and was not deterred by their failure to qualify for the Champions League",
      "Monday 2 June 2025 07:39, UK",
      "Manchester United have announced an agreement for the signing of Matheus Cunha from Wolves.",
      "Cunha will become Ruben Amorim's first signing of the summer as he looks to rebuild a squad that finished 15th in the Premier League - and the club have moved swiftly to seal the transfer on the opening day of the window.",
      "The 26-year-old is set to sign a five-year deal at United with the option for a further year.",
      "Cunha leaves Wolves as a club-record sale after United met his £62.5m release clause, agreeing to a structure of payment over two years. His signing is subject to visa and registration, say United.",
      "Cunha, who is set to play as a No 10 for United, scored 17 goals and provided six assists for Wolves last season.",
      "Wolves are happy Cunha's move has gone through as quickly as possible. The release clause which was inserted in his new contract in January has protected their position.",
      "Nobody at Wolves wanted a long drawn out saga involving the player during the summer. They will receive the full release clause in the terms set out in the contract - in three instalments payable by the summer of 2027. United were initially offering to pay in five instalments.",
      "Wolves expect to be busy this summer to build on the progress made under Vitor Pereira last season. They proved they were not a one-man team with their results and performances when Cunha was suspended.",
      "United have been keeping an eye on Cunha's development since his impressive display for Wolves at Old Trafford in the opening match of the 2023/24 season.",
      "Despite interest from other teams, Cunha wanted to play for United. He thinks United are one of the biggest clubs in the world and was not deterred by them missing out on Champions League football following their defeat to Tottenham in the Europa League final.",
      "United are understood to have been impressed with Cunha's desire to join, whether they had European football or not.",
      "Five Premier League teams, including United, wanted to sign the Brazil international this summer.",
      "Arsenal and Aston Villa were among those who held exploratory talks about signing the Brazil international this year. Saudi Pro League clubs were also willing to trigger his release clause.",
      "The forward, signed from Atletico Madrid in 2022 for around £34m, registered 15 goals and six assists across his 33 appearances in the Premier League throughout the 2024/25 season.",
      "\"Manchester United are desperate in that position. You think of what Manchester United are playing now, they've let Jadon Sancho, [Marcus] Rashford and Antony go, so three players who are natural players who travel with the ball.",
      "\"They're playing with [Alejandro] Garnacho at the moment but then they're lopsided. On the other side, sometimes it's [Joshua] Zirkzee when he was fit, or they've got Bruno Fernandes stepping up in moments. Mason Mount's come in there but they need someone who can beat players, someone who's equally as good running through the middle with the ball and travelling with the ball, and go out wide and support the wing-back.",
      "\"Cunha's the type of player that suits this system that Ruben Amorim wants to play.",
      "\"They've lost three players who play in that type of position so they need to fulfil that, they'll need to fill those roles definitely or else they're going to struggle.",
      "\"They need to score goals. Ruben Amorim said at the weekend that they're just struggling to score goals, so you need players who can take risks, good in the final third, and Cunha's got a lot of ability.\"",
      "\"Day one of this mini transfer window and Manchester United have confirmed their first signing.",
      "\"You'll remember that Cunha signed a new contract with Wolves in February, but that included this £62.5m release clause.",
      "\"Not only was there a release clause, there were conditions attached to it as well and it meant any club who met the clause had to pay it in three instalments.",
      "\"So Manchester United will have to pay a third of that transfer fee now and then the other two will come at the end of the next two seasons.",
      "\"It was in process from the end of the season. We were getting wind that Manchester United wanted to sign Cunha and he was really open to the move to Old Trafford.",
      "\"I'm sure that United will hope that now they've got someone like Cunha coming to the club, it might pave the way for way for other players.",
      "\"United still have that pulling power and the Cunha signing demonstrates that.",
      "\"This summer transfer window is going to be really important for United, particularly because it is Amorim's first summer transfer window.",
      "\"There are so many issues he has to deal with, so many player futures up in the air at the moment.\"",
      "Speaking to Cunha at Wolves' training ground last summer, it was a chance to ask him how important it is for him to feel like he is having fun on the football pitch. \"I do not want to go on the pitch and be a robot,\" he replied. \"I want to enjoy it.\"",
      "Watch Cunha play and that approach to the game shines through. At times, he can appear to wander where he chooses, making decisions off the cuff. But those decisions are often thrilling. He is a maverick in a sport that feels more and more coached.",
      "In the context of Gary Neville's comments about the recent Manchester derby being \"boring\" and the subsequent reports linking United with a move for the Brazilian forward, it all makes Cunha one of the more intriguing transfer targets of the summer window.",
      "Why? Because on one level, Cunha makes perfect sense in one of those No 10 roles within Ruben Amorim's 3-4-3 system. He already plays there for Wolves. He can score goals but also create them for others. His £64m release fee offers clarity for United.",
      "On the other hand, there are questions about his temperament and while Cunha, who turns 26 in May, is at the right age to make the big move of his career, some will ask if he can adapt to the demands and deliver consistently within an organised pressing structure.",
      "The summer transfer window will open again on Monday June 16 until Monday September 1 - with the deadline brought forward to 7pm this year."

      "Following the news Wolves' Matheus Cunha has completed his move to Manchester United, Adam Bate analyses what the Brazilian forward could bring to Old Trafford, reflecting on conversations with the man himself as well as Cunha's team-mates at Molineux...",
      "Monday 2 June 2025 12:20, UK",
      "Speaking to Matheus Cunha at Wolves' training ground last summer, it was a chance to ask him how important it is for him to feel like he is having fun on the football pitch. \"I do not want to go on the pitch and be a robot,\" he replied. \"I want to enjoy it.\"",

      "On the other hand, there are questions about his temperament and while Cunha, who turned 26 in May, is at the right age to make the big move of his career, some will ask if he can adapt to the demands and deliver consistently within an organised pressing structure.",
      "For example, one alarming statistic that has been picked up on is the fact that the Premier League tracking data reveals no outfield player spends a higher percentage of their time walking than Cunha. He is an outlier, someone who does things differently.",
      "\"I am an emotional guy.\" Cunha was self-aware enough to say that during our conversation. But it has not stopped him serving two significant suspensions since then, losing control after a defeat to Ipswich and during an FA Cup tie at Bournemouth.",
      "Cunha has been outspoken in calling out local journalists and even bloggers in Wolverhampton following criticism during the 2024/25 season. He was a popular figure with fans but one head coach Vitor Pereira says needs to feel the love from those around him.",
      "United may have had a few of those in their history, but being high maintenance at Wolves is one thing, being that way at Old Trafford is another. Even so, Cunha has the talent to become a folk hero. He is still a significant upgrade on their forward options at present.",
      "Gomes adds: \"He is a very creative player. Sometimes he has the ball and a lot of players around him but he can go and create a chance and make an assist and make a goal. It is very good to have a player like this because any minute he can score a goal.\"",
      "While Gomes talks of Cunha's \"shooting and passing\" as well as his \"intelligence with the ball\", speak to Wolves captain Nelson Semedo, who has played with both Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo, and he offers a fascinating assessment of Cunha as a human being.",
      "Semedo does not doubt the talent. \"He is Brazilian! It is natural.\" And sees a player coming towards his peak years. \"In his prime, I would say.\" Most interestingly, he tells a tale from the game between Wolves and Manchester United at Molineux in December.",
      "\"I think he is the kind of player who is never, ever happy with what he has, he always wants more, more, more. That is why sometimes we have to calm him down because I remember something from that game against United when we were winning 1-0.",
      "\"We were managing the game, not attacking every time, just being compact sometimes. He had a chance. I cannot remember who he gave the ball to but he was waiting for a pass back into the space for him to go.\" The pass did not come. \"He just got upset.\"",
      "Semedo explains: \"I think what we needed in that period of the game was just to be [compact]. But this [reaction] is because he wants more, because he is so ambitious. That is really good. It is why he is this good. I am pretty sure he will get even better.\"",
      "He tips Cunha for \"big things\", acknowledging that as Wolves' star player he found himself targeted - \"everywhere we play, they have an eye on Cunha\" - before making another pertinent point. \"And he is a very specific player,\" says Semedo. That is the crux of it.",
      "There are not many players like Cunha out there, a ball-carrier who operates across the front line, with the frame of a target man but the pace and trickery of a winger. At the moment, Amorim is forcing the pieces to fit. But there is a place for Cunha.",
      "He is at his best operating as a wide forward in that left channel. From there, he can play angled passes, cut in or run around the outside. Importantly, as he has demonstrated over the past two seasons, he can score goals from those zones to support the striker.",
      "Gary O'Neil attempted to convert Cunha into a striker himself in his first full season at Wolves, a necessity given the lack of options at his disposal. It was a challenge because those instincts did not come easily to him. He is unlikely to be United's answer as a No 9.",
      "Speaking to O'Neil about this issue at the time, he outlined the problem. \"He obviously has some fantastic individual attributes that can unlock things and get you up the pitch, but every time the ball is crossed I need my No 9 to be a threat. You have to be,\" he said.",
      "\"If you use [Erling] Haaland as the best example, he can go minutes without touching the ball but he is constantly making runs threatening the back line, making space for others, and you know that as soon as the ball comes across he is going to be sliding in.\"",
      "O'Neil tried to hammer home these points to Cunha. \"People actually watching the game will see that he came off the front, did a little turn, popped it to the winger. Great. But how many goals has he got? How many assists has he got?\" He had some success.",
      "The numbers improved, Cunha even scoring a hat-trick away to Chelsea. But he has remained a player who prefers the ball to feet rather than gambling on the ball falling his way inside the six-yard box. Pereira actually moved him further from the goal.",
      "With Jorgen Strand Larsen the reference point, Cunha often picked the ball up deeper, on that half turn with space to run into. United had another glimpse of that when he won the free-kick from which Pablo Sarabia scored the winner at Old Trafford.",
      "More striking was his player-of-the-match performance in the game there in the previous season, one United won 1-0 nevertheless as Andre Onana escaped punishment for what looked like a clear foul on Sasa Kalajdzic inside the penalty box during stoppage time.",
      "In a sense, that one evening against United highlights the Cunha conundrum in microcosm. He was outstanding, illustrating perfectly what the home side were missing. But when O'Neil substituted the tiring forward late in the game, he handled it badly.",
      "He admitted as much in that conversation last summer. \"One of my best games was against United at Old Trafford and he changed me. I started to think, 'Oh my god, this season will be hard with this coach. It is my best game and he is changing me, what can I do?'\"",
      "When Wolves were beaten in the next game, it proved too much for Cunha. \"I did not have a good reaction after two games and started to do crazy things saying training was not the best and Gary came to me and said, 'I am with you, I am not your enemy.'\"",
      "O'Neil talked Cunha around and the rest is history - culminating in two strong seasons that have earned him acclaim, a new contract and a big move too. Man Utd will be getting a special talent. But definitely no robot."

      "When asked if Fernandes had played his last game for United in their 3-1 friendly win over Hong Kong, Amorim replied: \"I do not think so. I do not know for sure, nobody knows, but I do not think so.",
      "\"I think he wants to stay, he is saying 'no' to a lot of things, but it shows that he wants to win and he is really good and needs to be in the best league in the world.",
      "\"Yes [we can turn down a £100m bid], we can find another way to earn money.",
      "\"Of course I am the manager, the coach, but sometimes it is the decision of the player, but of course I talk with him, I explain things and I just have that feeling. When you talk to someone, you have that feeling if he wants to stay.",
      "\"Of course in a lot of games this season he was so frustrated, but he knows what we are doing. The feeling that I have every time I speak to him is he wants to continue for sure at Man Utd. But you never know.\"",
      "United want to keep Fernandes, but Al Hilal believe every player has a price - especially one who will be 31 in September.",
      "The Portugal international signed a contract extension last summer until 2027 with the option of a further 12 months.",
      "Al Hilal have also held talks about signing Cristiano Ronaldo, who will become a free agent next month if he does not sign a new contract at Al Nassr.",
      "Al Hilal expect to have at least one big-name signing and a new head coach when they play in the Club World Cup in the United States in June.",
      "\"I think Bruno Fernandes is staying.",
      "\"I just watched Ruben Amorim there and he would have been told by his media handlers that 'you're going to be asked about this story, it's a massive story - just play it with a straight bat and say he's a Manchester United player and he's got two years left on his contract, I'm not going to talk about media speculation'.",
      "\"He didn't do that, he came out and he gave us quite a lot.",
      "\"You could tell he's spoken to Bruno Fernandes and Fernandes has said to him, 'I've got this incredible offer, it's like I've won EuroMillions, £200m over three years This is life-changing money boss but you know I'm not motivated by money. I love football, I love Manchester United'.",
      "\"I think he's sat down and spoken to Ruben Amorim and he's told him he is an integral part of the rebuild at Manchester United. I think he's happy to stay.",
      "\"The clock is ticking for Al Hilal because they are playing in the Club World Cup.",
      "\"They don't have a head coach, they've been trying to sign (Cristiano) Ronaldo, they've been trying to sign Bruno Fernandes, they're trying to get Simone Inzaghi out of Inter.",
      "\"There is a lot going on at Al Hilal because they are flying the flag for Saudi Arabia at the Club World Cup. But looking at Ruben Amorim today I think it's pretty clear and final that Bruno Fernandes is going to stay.\"",
      "The summer transfer window will open again on Monday June 16 until Monday September 1 - with the deadline brought forward to 7pm this year"
