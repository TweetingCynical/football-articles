      "Bruno Fernandes is facing an injury lay-off after title-chasing Aston Villa made it 10 straight wins. Manchester United captain Fernandes went off at half-time which is a huge worry for Ruben Amorim as they suffered a rare defeat at Villa Park.",
      "Incredibly, it was only Villa's second win in 27 Premier League home games against United as Morgan Rogers' spectacular double put Unai Emery's men back to within three points of leaders Arsenal.",
      "But it was a bad day for United with Amorim now concerned that Fernandes - who has missed just 17 games in five years since arriving in 2020 - will be out while he also expects Kobbie Mainoo to miss the Boxing Day fixture with Newcastle United.",
      "United boss Amorim, who said Mainoo missed the Villa game after suffering a calf injury, added: \"It's a soft tissue, I think he's going to lose some games, I don't know for sure. Let's see. I don't know. I don't what to talk about matters you can't control.",
      "\"He is a guy who is always fit, so he might recover quite well. I think Kobbie Mainoo is out, Bruno is out. We will see. No excuses, we need to win the next game and we will try to win the next game.",
      "The Red Devils, who are already without Noussair Mazraoui, Amad and Bryan Mbeumo because of AFCON, play Newcastle at home before hosting Wolves four days later. Their first game of 2026 is away to Leeds.",
      "Amorim went on to address United's wider injury problems, having called on two academy graduates for their debuts in the second half. \"It is really strange,\" the Red Devils boss explained.",
      "\"During this year, especially at this time, we have so many problems, but we have to cope with that. I think [Jack] Fletcher did his first game, so that is good news, [Shea] Lacey the same, so we will try to find solutions and go for the next game.",
      "\"I am a manager for six years and even Sporting [Lisbon] is all about the academy, so it's about the history. Every manager wants to bring players through from the academy and not spend money because this gives value to the manager.",
      "\"I just want to win and want to be certain that the players that come in from the academy are not going to suffer too much. I'm just trying to help the club, it doesn't matter if it's from the academy or abroad.\"",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Unai Emery tore off his coat, swirled it above his head and then threw it away in sheer delight. Villa Park was alive, the noise was deafening as the home fans stood together to cheer another unforgettable moment from Morgan Rogers.",
      "There have been a few this season but his first of two pieces of magic in one game underlines why Emery’s Aston Villa are in the thick of this title race. No wonder Emery was excited.",
      "It is now 10 straight wins in all competitions for Villa and, even more incredibly, it was only their second win over United in 27 Premier League games at Villa Park. They are a team blitzing records.",
      "It also showed why England boss Thomas Tuchel rates Rogers so highly and the Villa forward is making a very strong case to start the World Cup even ahead of his boyhood pal Jude Bellingham. Rogers was exceptional and, most importantly, he stepped up when Villa needed him most because they were not at their best and could count themselves rather fortunate to win.",
      "Manchester United played well in large parts of the game but they lacked the game-changing, defining moments of brilliance which are supposed to be in the club’s DNA. Matheus Cunha drew them level with a brilliant, clinical finish but then missed an absolute sitter to get United a second equaliser.",
      "Even more worryingly, Bruno Fernandes went off at half-time after stretching out his leg and if he is out for any time then you fear for a United team already missing Bryan Mbeumo and Amad who are away on AFCON duty. You might have thought it could be a chance for Kobbie Mainoo but he missed the trip to Villa Park because of a calf injury.",
      "A cynic might be suspicious that his absence came just a few days after his brother wore a “Free Kobbie Mainoo” T-shirt in protest at his continued absence from the United starting line-up. But surely no manager would cut off their nose to spite their face.",
      "Ruben Amorim also needs every bit of help he can get. Another blank for £74m striker Benjamin Sesko who has yet to get going at Old Trafford.",
      "Amorim cut a frustrated figure as he threw on youngsters Shea Lacey and also Jack Fletcher - son of ex-United midfielder Darren who is still on the staff - for his senior debut. But even as Villa tired, United just could not find a way back.",
      "Rogers reigned supreme again as he just looks unstoppable right now. For club and country.",
      "Is Morgan Rogers currently the best player in the Premier League? Let us know your pick in the comments section.",
      "His first goal lit up the whole game because after Villa’s fast start, it had faded away. Then Rogers struck. John McGinn sent over a long ball, Rogers’ heavy touch nearly let it run out of play but he showed all his pace and determination to keep it in.",
      "Rogers then darted in from the left wing, cut inside and then curled a sensational shot into the top corner to give Villa the lead on 45 minutes. But, within three minutes and deep into first half injury time, United levelled.",
      "Matty Cash found himself under pressure, Patrick Dorgu got a touch to Cunha who steadied himself and then made a smart finish into the far corner. Villa were ahead again after 57 minutes.",
      "Youri Tielemans put the ball across, Ollie Watkins could not control it and then Rogers latched on and curled another brilliant shot into the far corner. Another Christmas cracker from Rogers. Sheer brilliance. Somehow Cunha headed wide from Dorgu’s cross to level again and Villa held on.",
      "United will play worse and win. This was not a day for an Amorim crisis but it was a game which highlighted the reliance on Fernandes, a growing list of absences and also Sesko’s continual struggles. In contrast, after Villa’s worst start in 28 years which left them in utter disarray, they now have an incredible and wonderful momentum.",

      "Morgan Rogers was the star of the show as Aston Villa beat Manchester United 2-1 at Villa Park. The victory makes it 10 in a row for Unai Emery's side, who are keeping pace with Arsenal and Manchester City at the top.",
      "A special strike from Rogers opened the scoring on the brink of half-time. But it was quickly cancelled out by Matheus Cunha in rather fortuitous circumstances after an early Christmas present from Matty Cash.",
      "With Bruno Fernandes going off injured at the interval, United were weakened and Rogers took advantage by scoring his and Villa's second goal before the hour mark. Ruben Amorim's toothless attack were unable to draw level and saw their four-game unbeaten run come to an end.",
      "Here are five talking points from Villa Park.",
      "With Casemiro suspended, there was a good chance that Kobbie Mainoo would finally start his first Premier League game of the season. But when team news was confirmed, the 20-year-old was conspicuous by his absence.",
      "As it turns out, Mainoo injured his calf during training on Saturday and it wasn't some form of punishment by Amorim. A storm erupted this week after Mainoo's half-brother wore a t-shirt to Monday's 4-4 draw with Bournemouth emblazoned with the text 'Free Kobbie Mainoo'.",
      "Who else to open the scoring? Rogers has now scored six goals in his last six league games since the November international break.",
      "His luscious effort to break the deadlock against the run of play was the pick of the bunch, too. Collecting the ball on the left flank, Rogers glided inside and took on Leny Yoro before unleashing a curling strike into Senne Lammens' top-right corner.",
      "United's goalkeeper didn't even move. For Rogers' second, he beat Yoro again and produced a similar albeit less spectacular strike which Lammens had no chance of stopping.",
      "It'll take something unwelcome or someone special for Rogers not to be starting for England at the World Cup. Cole Palmer and Jude Bellingham have their work cut out.",
      "United probably owe Cash a Christmas card. In May, his weak backpass led to Emi Martinez's sending off in a moment that changed the course of the teams' last meeting, a 2-0 win for the Red Devils.",
      "This time, the Poland international dawdled on the ball and was caught by the pressing of Patrick Dorgu. The ball fell kindly to Cunha, whose first-time finish ripped past Martinez.",
      "United, who'd dominated parts of the first half, were level just three minutes after conceding. But there was a concern, with Bruno Fernandes clutching his hamstring on multiple occasions before the break.",
      "It's not often you see Fernandes nursing an injury and even rarer to see him being substituted because of one. But a hamstring problem forced United's captain off at half-time and he was replaced by Lisandro Martinez, brought on to play in an unconventional midfield role.",
      "The Red Devils had less of a goal threat with the enforced changed, perhaps a sign of things to come. With the always hectic festive period ahead, and with both Bryan Mbeumo and Amad at the Africa Cup of Nations, Fernandes' prolonged absence would be sorely felt.",
      "A lot has been said about the Red Devils' academy in recent weeks, much of it by Amorim. But the United manager put his faith in youth by firstly subbing on Jack Fletcher, the son of ex-United star Darren.",
      "There was another debut soon after, as the highly rated Shae Lacey entered proceedings in the closing stages. But there were no dream debuts, as Villa saw out the win.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Bruno Fernandes has handed Manchester United an injury blow during his side's game at Aston Villa on Sunday, coming off with a hamstring complaint.",
      "Ruben Amorim's side were in desperate need of a result heading into Sunday's clash at Villa Park, not least to keep the pace with top four rivals Liverpool and Chelsea. A win in the Midlands would take them level on 29 points, while a draw would leave them two points adrift.",
      "It was a lively start to the game, with Villa close to scoring through Morgan Rogers on occasion. United also had chances through Matheus Cunha and Benjamin Sesko.",
      "The deadlock was eventually broken on the brink of half-time as Rogers did get his goal, cutting inside and firing a rocket into the net from just inside the box. But Villa's lead was short-lived as United got back on level terms almost instantly as Matty Cash was dispossessed close to the United goal and Cunha found the far corner.",
      "It can be argued the scoreline was the least of United's concerns, however, as captain Fernandes appeared to pull up late in the first-half. He was able to play on until the whistle, but was clearly in some discomfort as the players made their way to the dressing room.",
      "Therefore, it was no surprise to see Amorim make a change at the break. There were limited options on the bench, with both Joshua Zirkzee and Lisandro Martinez the only two senior outfield players available.",
      "It was Martinez who got the nod, with Fernandes then pictured with his coat on making his way back to the bench before kick-off. It was a bitter flow for the Red Devils as their captain has arguably been one of their most consistent performers this term.",
      "Interestingly, pundit and former United defender Gary Neville was a little surprised by Amorim's decision to take a more defensive approach with his change. Speaking on commentary, he questioned why it was Martinez instead of Zirkzee who was called upon for the second 45 minutes.",
      "\"I am surprised because I thought Zirkzee would come on just because he is closer to Bruno's position,\" Neville argued. \"I am quite surprised.",
      "\"Zirkzee doesn't look like he is too happy with it either, but you can see there now Martinez has gone in there alongside (Manuel) Ugarte in central midfield. He played there for Ajax a few times as well, United now have a back five and Ugarte and Martinez in front.",
      "\"It was a real shock to see Bruno pull up with his hamstring because he is ever present and hardly misses a game.\"",
      "It took a little over ten minutes into the second half, but Villa were able to restore their lead to make it 2-1. Rogers, once again, found the net for the hosts with another curled effort into the far corner."

      "Former Manchester United midfielder Nemanja Matic played under four different managers during his Old Trafford spell. Jose Mourinho brought him to Old Trafford, but it was the Portuguese's successor Ole Gunnar Solskjaer who Matic believes was dismissed too early.",
      "Solskjaer replaced Mourinho in December 2019, initially on an interim basis before being appointed permanently. He was the second United boss of Matic's five years at Old Trafford, eventually losing his job in 2021",
      "Michael Carrick and Ralf Rangnick spent time in interim charge after Solskjaer's dismissal, which came after a 4-1 loss at Watford left United seventh in the Premier League. Reflecting on the Norwegian's stint four years later, though, Matic argued United pulled the trigger too soon.",
      "“We finished second and third under him. There was an atmosphere in the team that we weren’t happy finishing second, but when you see the results now, we did amazingly,\" Matic told FourFourTwo",
      "“I think Ole deserved more time – and when I say Ole, I also want to mention his staff, like Michael Carrick and Kieran McKenna. They were going the right way to bring United back.",
      "“Of course, they made the decision to sack Ole based on his final couple of results, but he was an amazing person with the right profile for the club. He and his assistants understood football – training was perfect and had every little detail ready for us.\"",
      "Matic praised Solskjaer, in part for how he was able to keep players on board even when they weren't playing regularly. The Serbian started just four of United's 12 league games in his final season, but recognised the manager was someone who knew the club.",

      "Manchester United's skipper Bruno Fernandes reportedly has a release clause in his contract that is only applicable to clubs outside the Premier League. Since joining from Sporting in January 2020 for just under £50million, the Portuguese midfielder has become a key player for the Red Devils.",
      "He was appointed captain by ex-manager Erik ten Hag in 2023 and has since racked up over 300 appearances for the club. Under the guidance of Ruben Amorim this season, Fernandes has netted five goals and provided seven assists in his 17 outings across all competitions.",
      "His importance to the team is undeniable, but there was a chance he might not have been at Old Trafford this season if certain members of United's top brass had their way last summer.",

      "Despite the prospect of a significant salary increase, Fernandes chose to stay at Old Trafford, with Amorim also keen to retain him, despite apparent opposition from higher up.",
      "\"The club wanted me to go, I have that in my head,\" he recently confessed to Canal 11. \"I told the directors this, but I think they didn't have the courage to make that decision.",
      "\"I decided to stay, also because of family reasons, but because I genuinely like the club. The conversation with the manager also made me stay. But, from the club's side, I felt a bit like, 'if you leave, it's not so bad for us.' It hurts me a lot.",

      "Ruben Amorim has not ruled out January transfers for Manchester United and only wants players who can strengthen his team even after Amad, Bryan Mbeumo and Noussair Mazraoui return from AFCON. That is not always a simple task, but it could help the Portuguese coach kick on this season.",
      "United could go into Christmas in fifth place with a victory over Aston Villa, and new signings could offer a timely boost for Amorim, having already strengthened his squad in the summer with Mbeumo, Matheus Cunha and Benjamin Sesko. Perhaps other areas now need attention.",
      "\"We'll see,\" Amorim said when asked if money was available for the transfer window. \"The only thing we know is that we only would try to bring players that we think are going to be the future.",
      "\"It's not going to be to save something in this moment, to cope with the losses of three players for AFCON. \"It’s not going to be like that, even if we try to bring one player, maybe it's not the position that we need more.",
      "\"We will try to bring now – and in the end of the season – players that are perfect for our future. I don't know what is going to happen, but it's possible that we can do something.\"",
      "Antoine Semenyo may be top of the agenda, given the opportunity his £65million release clause provides. The Bournemouth star favours a move to Liverpool, but already met Amorim last summer.",
      "The Portuguese coach is interested in fielding Semenyo as a wingback should he arrive and is said to be unconvinced by his current options. That could see an aggressive set of wingbacks in Amad and Semenyo, when the United boss returns to his favoured formation.",
      "The duo would flank a back three of Leny Yoro , Mathhijs de Ligt and Lisandro Martinez, who would play in front of Senne Lammens. Luke Shaw would be a stiff contender for a spot, but Martinez's passing may give him an edge.",

      "Neves, 28, would cost in the region £20m but could bring significant wage demands after commanding £350,000-a-week. Conor Gallagher could prove to be an alternative option, while it is claimed United are interested in Bournemouth ace Tyler Adams.",
      "Neves would be a strong candidate to start alongside Bruno Fernandes and to keep possession ticking. Tyler Adams may offer more robustness, but is out injured currently, and a second midfield addition may only open the possibility of Old Trafford exits.",

      "Germany star Karim Adeyemi will be hit with a fine by Borussia Dortmund following his reaction to being substituted against Borussia Monchengladbach on Friday. The 23-year-old has been linked with a Premier League switch, making it clear he favours Arsenal over Manchester United, but for now remains at Signal Iduna Park",
      "Controversy has followed Adeyemi around of late. The forward, who is represented by Jorge Mendes, recently issued an apology after being fined €450,000 due to being in possession of two illegal weapons (a knuckeduster and a taser), claiming they arrived in a ‘mystery box’ he ordered online.",
      "Adeyemi has six goals and three assists to his name this season, and has either started or come off the bench in every one of Dortmund's Bundesliga games. He lasted an hour against Gladbach on Friday but appeared none too happy about being withdrawn by manager Niko Kovac.",
      "Sporting director Sebastian Kehl intervened when Adeyemi attempted to walk straight down the tunnel. Speaking to Sky Germany after the game (via Yahoo), Kehl explained the situation in more detail while confirming a fine was incoming.",
      "“I told him: He’s not going to the locker room, he’s sitting there,“ Kehl said. ”The substitution was totally justified. Karim didn’t play well. He will be punished for it. I don’t want to see that reaction and neither does the coach or anyone else. It’s not right, and Karim knows that too.",
      "“We’ve discussed this issue intensively with the team in recent weeks. If a player is unhappy, he can express it in the locker room or in the next day’s training session.“",
      "Kovac, meanwhile, said the substitution was performance-based and might even have happened earlier. \"I could have made the substitution at halftime, but I didn’t want to. I wanted to give him another chance,” the Croatian said.",
      "Dortmund led early against Gladbach through Julian Brandt but had to wait until the final minute for Maximilian Beier to make the points safe. It means Kovac's side sit second heading into the winter break, albeit still some way adrift of league leaders Bayern Munich.",
      "“I’m very happy that we won. At the end of the day, it was deserved,\" Kovac said. \"We only allowed Gladbach one dangerous chance and missed one or two really good chances ourselves.",
      "\"We started well, but then didn’t do so well in the last 15 minutes of the first half. Gladbach came back a bit then. In the second half, it was an open game. We have to continue to work hard, stay focused, work together with the ball, but also against the ball. Then this team definitely have what it takes to finish in the top four.”",

      "Manchester United may have seen Alejandro Garnacho as one of the club's future stars, but the player clearly had other ideas.",
      "Chelsea snapped up Garnacho from United in August for £40 million following a breakdown in his relationship with Red Devils manager Ruben Amorim. Just over a year earlier, in December 2024, United had celebrated Garnacho after the 21-year-old winger was crowned FIFA Puskas Award winner, highlighting the club's deep appreciation for their player.",
      "Despite the affection shown to Garnacho by the Red Devils, it seems the feeling wasn't entirely mutual, with Garnacho showing no remorse about departing the red half of Manchester. The Argentine claimed the award for his spectacular goal against Everton in November 2023, when he executed a remarkable overhead kick.",
      "After the strike was recognised as the finest goal scored anywhere on the planet between August 2023 and August 2024, United made sure to praise their young talent. Their message suggested a lengthy future together lay ahead.",
      "A United statement said: \"Congratulations to Alejandro Garnacho, who is the winner of the FIFA Puskas Award for 2024. The Manchester United winger has been recognised for the stunning, acrobatic bicycle kick he netted at Everton in November 2023. Well done to our No. 17, and thanks to all those who supported him. It's a goal that we'll cherish for years to come.\"",
      "Garnacho, even followed the footsteps of his idol Cristiano Ronaldo to become only the second United player to win the award after the Portuguese superstar, is now donning Chelsea blue. Ronaldo was the first recipient of the award back in 2009 for his long-range goal against FC Porto during the 2008/09 season while playing for United.",
      "A year later, Garnacho has swapped Old Trafford for Stamford Bridge and he's not looking back. The winger candidly admitted that his departure from United wasn't a heart-wrenching affair.",
      "He even suggested that leaving United was a necessary move for his career progression. When asked if he had any regrets, Garnacho simply responded, \"No.\" Probed further about whether he felt any sadness over how his time at United concluded, he reiterated: \"No.\"",
      "He added: \"Sometimes in life you need to change things to take a step forward or improve as a player,\" Garnacho explained. \"It was the right moment, and the right club. So it was an easy decision.\"",
      "Upon joining Chelsea, Garnacho didn't hold back in praising his new club during an interview with the official Chelsea media channel.",
      "\"I watched the Club World Cup and to join the world champions is special,\" he said. \"We're the best team in the world! It's amazing to be here and I'm very happy.\"",
      "During his time at United, Garnacho made 144 appearances, netting 26 goals and providing 22 assists. While he views his move to west London as the best decision for his career, his farewell message to United suggests he still holds some fondness for his former club.",
      "Garnacho, who has netted four goals and provided two assists in 18 appearances for Chelsea, said: \"After an unforgettable five years, this special chapter in my life now comes to a close. We have created moments that will stay with me forever, and I'm very grateful for this.",
      "\"To the coaches, staff, and my team-mates, thank you for believing in me. Every time I wore the badge, I gave everything I had. I leave proud of what we achieved together and excited for what's to come. Wishing the club nothing but success for the future, while I look forward to giving my all in the next chapter of my career.\"",

      "Despite Lindelof spending considerable time in the Premier League, from 2017, when the Red Devils splashed out £30million to bring the Swedish international from Benfica, it wasn't until 2023 that his wife was first given the notable label.",
      "The artificial intelligence app AttractivenessTest.com determined that Maja boasts an attractiveness rating of 9.7/10. However, despite receiving the accolade, she previously revealed on her blog that she loathes being labelled a 'WAG'.",
      "\"I am so sick and tired of people trying to make me smaller,\" she wrote. \"Tired of people not knowing what's important in life. I am an entrepreneur. I have my own company and soon I will start one more. If that is with money or love is none of your business.\"",
      "As owner of fashion brand lisbonneatelier, Maja has built an impressive career for herself and this year moved from Manchester to the Midlands after her husband joined Aston Villa.",
      "Villa emerged victorious in securing Lindelof's services this summer after interest in him from several clubs. He expressed his excitement on deadline day, telling Villa TV: \"Obviously it's massive club, and I was super excited when I heard that the club wanted me.",
      "\"I spoke to my wife and we felt it was a good move for us as a family and for me as a player. I'm super, super happy and proud to be part of this football club.\" Lindelof is expected to take to the field in Villa's home match against Man United on Sunday afternoon, marking his first encounter with his old team since leaving last summer.",
      "After making his first league start in their 3-2 victory over West Ham last weekend, his previous ties with United could be a game-changer, Villa manager Unai Emery suggests. The Spanish boss said: \"He has experience and he is a very good professional. He has qualities too.",
      "\"He is still being young to play football. We signed him in the last moments of the transfer window, because when we identified that possibility, I wanted in that moment everything that he did last week [vs West Ham].",
      "“In 90 minutes he did everything I expected from him. He was really fantastic. Every day it is easy how we are working because his adaptation is so quick, and everything we need, through his experiences, he can give us.",

      "Former Manchester United star Nicky Butt believes Ruben Amorim might be paving the way for Kobbie Mainoo to depart his boyhood club. The 20-year-old is yet to make a Premier League start this season, and speculation is mounting that he could head out on loan next month, with Napoli leading the chase for his services.",
      "United manager Amorim has stood by his decision to keep the midfielder on the substitutes' bench, insisting \"Kobbie needs to fight for his job\". He added that it's \"not a bad thing to be on the bench of Manchester United when you are 20 years old.\"",
      "Once hailed as United's next big thing after breaking through with a string of impressive displays during the 2023/2024 campaign, both Butt and former Premier League manager Sam Allardyce reckon the youngster's days at Old Trafford could be numbered. The duo also believe Mainoo should now seek opportunities elsewhere.",
      "Speaking exclusively on the Footy Accumulators No Tippy Tappy Football podcast, in partnership with BOYLE Sports, Butt suggests that Mainoo has found himself trapped in a damaging cycle where extended spells on the sidelines are hampering his ability to make an impact.",
      "The ex-midfielder believes that Mainoo's lacklustre showings when he does feature only serve to vindicate Amorim's choice to regularly bench the youngster, potentially making it easier to offload the star - whether that's in January or during the summer window.",
      "Amorim has extended an open invitation to Mainoo, stating: \"If Mainoo wants to come and talk to me, he can\". However, Butt suspects there's a reason why Mainoo hasn't approached the manager about his lack of game time.",
      "Butt said: \"Nowadays, every player has a management team behind them to look after him. Why is his management team not telling him to go and talk? It might be a case of, don't go in there because we're leaving in January anyway, so I don't really know the ins and outs of it, but it's just a very sad situation.",
      "\"He's a great lad, Kobbie. I've known him since he was around 7 or 8 years of age, he's a great talent. It was only a year ago that he was playing in the Champions League at 18, he's not going to lose his talent overnight.\"",
      "\"Kobbie has played nine games this season, and every single one of them has been as a sub. How can he judge someone off that? When I was at United, I wasn't always starting, I had Keane and Scholes in front of me most of the time, I wasn't always getting game time which is why I left.\"",
      "He added: \"There's nothing worse than being out for five or six games, and then the manager puts you in and says, Go and show me what you've got. Because then you've got no rhythm, it takes you five games to get going, from my own experience.",
      "\"So if Kobbie gets put in the next game, for example, I guarantee you he won't play well. Then the manager goes, I told you so.\"",
      "From a managerial perspective, Allardyce defended Amorim. The 71-year-old feels it's up to Mainoo to seek more game time, but he's concerned that the ongoing saga could dent the young midfielder's confidence and suggested he might need to consider leaving the club.",
      "Allardyce said: \"He's right. He's rather busy and doing what he's doing. Mainoo's priorities are to stand out in training and prove to the manager his worth to go back into the team. It's also his responsibility to go and knock on the door and ask why he's not playing, not the other way around.",
      "\"When you're managing Man United, you haven't got a minute spare. If he's not going to be in the team on Saturday, because he's already got it in his mind whether he is or he isn't, then Mainoo doesn't take priority. He needs to impress to get a chance to be put back in, and he can't wait too long before he has to leave.\"",
      "He went on to say: \"If you destroy somebody's confidence, it's very difficult for them to come back. He's not destroying his confidence on purpose. Whoever Mainoo has around him outside of the football club has a massive responsibility to keep him on track. The amount of players I've seen just finish their training, get their clothes on, and go home is ridiculous. They don't even try to impress the manager.",
      "\"Amorim can't give him four or five games to get back on track, because he hasn't got the time. He needs the results now, or he'll be going next.",
      "\"He [Mainoo] needs to get away. It'll be foolish for him to sign a new contract at Man United and be a squad player. You play football because it's a talent you've been given and the dream of so many millions of others that haven't made it, and you've got to go and play football.\"",

Mainoo could be in line for his first league start of the campaign at Aston Villa on Sunday, with Amorim hinting at a tactical shift to a back four that might accommodate him as one of three central midfielders.",
      "Should he get the nod, Amorim encouraged the youngster to channel any frustration into his performance. \"I'm not trying to say to Kobbie, 'You are a big player here, let's put him on the bench to show something',\" he explained.",
      "\"No, no. What I'm saying is the opposite. I'm just not putting Kobbie sometimes because I understand that this is not the right guy to start the game. Maybe the next game, on Sunday, he is going to start.",
      "\"If he plays well, he's going to show everyone. 'This guy cannot take me from the team', and I will be so happy, so I don't care. I don't want to show nothing to anyone. I'm just saying that I'm trying to win games and to show to the players that if you do the things right, you will play no matter what the name.\"",
      "Just a week earlier, Amorim had suggested Mainoo could seek a January loan if he wished. That conversation never materialised, but Mainoo's situation took an intriguing twist on Monday when his half-brother Jordan turned up to the Bournemouth match sporting a T-shirt emblazoned with 'Free Kobbie Mainoo'.",
      "\"He's a shy boy, but it's not his responsibility. He's responsible for his acts and his act was to play well in the last game, I'm just focused on that,\" said Amorim.",
      "\"I had the situation in Sporting (Lisbon) that my brother wrote something on the internet, and I have to answer for that. My explanation is that he has his life, he has his opinion, and it's nothing to do with me. So I will do the same with Kobbie.\"",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Is there money in the coffers for another attacking recruit?",
      "Unai Emery has pointed to Aston Villa's fruitful January 2025 window when addressing the prospect of adding to his squad next month.",

It is said that the 21-year-old could be 'the nearest thing to Rodri'. With that said, there's no immediate suggestion that either Pavlovic or Bayern want to go their separate ways.",
      "Doesn't sound like he'll be leaving soon...",
      "\"Kobbie needs to fight for his job. I think that it's not a bad thing to be on the bench of Manchester United when you are 20 years old.",
      "\"I remember (Cristiano) Ronaldo was on the bench, (Wayne) Rooney was on the bench sometimes. (Juan Sebastian) Veron was not playing.",
      "\"I remember all the history of Manchester United and (there is) nobody this didn't fall (to), so let's continue in trying to avoid the nonsense and the noise.\"",

      "Aston Villa boss Unai Emery insists he is committed to the plan of getting the best out of loanee Jadon Sancho before the season's end. The United winger is currently plying his trade with the Villans and is therefore unavailable this weekend so as to avoid playing against his parent club.",
      "Rumours have been building as the January transfer window nears with talk that Villa may end Sancho's deal early to make room in the squad for a permanent addition. However, Emery is relishing the thought of getting the peak of the England international's career while he is still at the club.",
      "He said: \"Jadon is still being young. He has had an amazing career and is now in a moment where he needs help to recover his best performance. I have this challenge with him. He has this challenge with me as well. Of course, he is not playing all the minutes I think he has to.",
      "\"But in the second part of the season, I believe in him. He is really being demanding himself to try to get his best moment this season with us. Of course, on Sunday we are finishing December and then starting January soon. The first match back he will play is against Chelsea.",
      "\"He has that challenge with me and himself, and with the club as well. I believe in him and hopefully we can get it.\"",

      "The 24-year-old has made 10 appearances so far for United this season and scored just one goal against Crystal Palace. In recent weeks, the Dutch star has made more of an impact but managed just seven minutes in total against Wolves and Bournemouth.",

      "Manchester United legend Ryan Giggs believes Ruben Amorim might discover a positive aspect in losing three crucial players to the Africa Cup of Nations. The Portuguese manager will be deprived of Bryan Mbeumo, Noussair Mazraoui and Amad Diallo until January as the trio depart to pursue international glory.",
      "United are amongst the Premier League's most heavily African-represented teams. They share third place with several other clubs for the highest number of African players and also sit fourth for the percentage of minutes played by African internationals.",
      "No boss wants to be without players at any point during the campaign, but the problem can become particularly acute during the packed festive schedule, when teams like United face three matches within nine days.",
      "Yet absences can also present chances, enabling other squad members to step forward and prove their worth. Giggs reckons that, despite the upheaval, Amorim might gain from the circumstances.",
      "\"Sesko is now back, which helps. But it's definitely going to be a blow because Mbeumo has probably been the best player so far this season and looks like a real threat. Plays every game, has power, scores goals, and Amad can make things happen. So yeah, it's going to be tough.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "\"I'm not too sure. But those two lads [Mbeumo and Amad] are definitely going to be missed. And I think United fans are just hoping that their countries don't go through the group stage, and we don't miss them for too long.",
      "\"The plus side is that Mason Mount has come back into the team. And that's a massive plus. You never know how good a player is until they're playing regularly.",
      "\"And now we're starting to see the Mason Mount that we've seen at Chelsea for a number of years. He's a good, clever player. All the coaches like him. When you're a manager, you want players you can trust, and he looks like someone you can really trust.\"",
      "Benjamin Sesko has struggled to find his feet in the Premier League. The striker has netted just twice in the competition, with a knee problem that ruled him out for nearly a month disrupting his progress.",
      "Now back to full fitness, he'll be determined to prove his worth.",
      "Lisandro Martinez is also working his way back to peak condition following a cruciate ligament injury that sidelined him for nearly 300 days. The Argentine defender has faced numerous injury setbacks since arriving at Old Trafford and will be desperate to put those troubles behind him.",
      "Mason Mount, similar to Martinez, has had his fair share of injury woes since joining United. Now back in form, the England international is showing promising signs as a regular starter under Amorim.",

      "\"We need to play a little bit different,\" Amorim said to MUTV ahead of Sunday’s trip to Villa Park. \"We lost some one-against-one. We will see but we'll be ready for the game.",
      "\"It's perfect, it's not perfect as we don't have all the players, but we are ready. We have players that can solve the game for us, so are happy with that.",

The Slovenian is now back in contention having missed four matches with a knee injury, while he made a substitute appearance last time against Bournemouth.",
      "\"I think he is a different type of striker,\" Amorim said about the forward. \"The only one in that part because Josh [Zirkzee] is more like a no.9 and 10 at the same time, a little bit like Cunha. Ben is a guy who likes to be in the box. He makes a lot of runs.",

The visitors were level a few minutes later. Patrick Dorgu nicked the ball off Matty Cash and Matheus Cunha found another excellent finish.",
      "The game was delivering spectacular moments and Villa found another when Rogers again whipped a brilliant finish into the top corner.",
      "Here are how the United players rated at Villa Park:",
      "Senne Lammens: Powerless to stop either goal and a solid enough game aside from that. One good first half stop from John McGinn, although might have pushed it wide of goal. 6",
      "Leny Yoro: Awful for Rogers' first goal when he never made any attempt to get close to the brilliant playmaker. Looked scared to make a tackle for the second. 4",
      "Ayden Heaven: Stood up well to the challenge posed by an experienced England international. Some good moments against Ollie Watkins and edged that battle. 7",
      "Luke Shaw: Saw play go down the other flank. Tidy enough in possession but didn't have an awful lot to do at times in the game. 6",
      "Diogo Dalot: Offered an outlet and got involved in the game but looks better on the left from an attacking point of view. Two poor, floaty crosses on his left foot. 6",
      "Manuel Ugarte: Just not good enough in possession to hold down a place in this team. Moved further forward after Bruno Fernandes went off and looked ill-suited to that role. 4",
      "Bruno Fernandes: Looked in trouble when he stopped the game to grab his hamstring. Still had a shot after that but his absence is going to be massive. 6",
      "Patrick Dorgu: Settled into the game on his return to the team and looked more assured than he has done for a long time. Good work for Cunha's goal and created another chance. 7",
      "Mason Mount: Busy throughout the game. Won possession well in the first half, created a chance for Benjamin Sesko and stood up in the second half. 7",
      "Matheus Cunha: Again United's most dangerous player and has really come to the party over the last week. Took his goal well but should have got a second. 7",
      "Benjamin Sesko: Wasted two good first-half chances and didn't do enough to rattle Victor Lindelof, who is normally uncomfortable against physical strikers. 5",
      "Substitutes:",
      "Lisandro Martinez: In an unfamiliar role but started well and was good on the ball. Looks a better option there than Ugarte. 7",
      "Jack Fletcher: Solid on his debut. 6",
      "Joshua Zirkzee: Quiet. 6",
      "Shea Lacey: Little time to make an impact but hit a late shot at Martinez. 6",
      "Subs not used: Altay Bayindir, Tom Heaton, Tyler Fredricson, Tyrell Malacia, Bendito Mantato",

      "\"I think Kobbie might be out [against Newcastle], Bruno is out, so we will see, we are going to find solutions, no excuses, we need to win the next game and we will try to win the next game.\"",
      "United are reluctant to make a move for a short-term target in January, and Amorim has confirmed that he wants to stick to the long-term plan and wouldn't be asking director of football Jason Wilcox and chief executive Omar Berrada for a sticking plaster solution.",
      "They are set to make a move for Antoine Semenyo when the window opens, with the attacker set to leave Bournemouth next month, but a move for a midfielder might have to wait until the summer.",
      "\"What we cannot do is to reach January and try to do everything in urgency and make mistakes,\" said Amorim. \"And then here we go again with a lot of mistakes. I'm not going to get with Jason under Omar and I'm going to say we need a lot of players because we have a plan.",
      "\"If we have to suffer, the club comes first. Of course, we are in the moment that we need points, but we need to find solutions and we are going to continue with our plan. Of course, you can feel that in this moment we are going to struggle, but we'll see.\"",

      "When Ruben Amorim looks under his tree on Christmas Day, he is likely to be disappointed. The Manchester United head coach could do with finding a couple of midfielders wrapped up, and no pair of socks will make up for the disappointment of not finding Elliot Anderson or Adam Wharton ready to pop out of a box.",
      "Amorim suggested on Friday that United were unlikely to sign a midfielder in January, but then he didn't expect to finish the game at Aston Villa with Lisandro Martinez and Jack Fletcher in the middle of the pitch. Christmas should be a time of giving, but it's been a costly week for Amorim and United.",
      "Having seen Noussair Mazraoui, Amad and Bryan Mbeumo depart for the Africa Cup of Nations, he saw Kobbie Mainoo limp out of training on Saturday and Bruno Fernandes pull up at the end of the first half. Casemiro's suspension left the outmatched Manuel Ugarte as the only senior midfielder left standing.",
      "Ugarte has fallen out of favour under Amorim, and at times at Villa Park, you could see why. His work in possession was particularly poor. He had to fill Fernandes' box-to-box role in the second half and it's difficult to make a case for a team stretched to that degree getting a result against the Premier League's in-form team.",
      "That run of form is built on shaky foundations if you believe the data geeks, but Morgan Rogers is doing his best to condemn the boffins to the bin this season. He is making a habit of scoring stunners, so the solution is to make sure he can't shoot. Instead, Leny Yoro was so busy handing out gifts he should have been wearing a white beard.",
      "He was too passive against Rogers and paid the price twice. It undid a lot of the good work that United put in at Villa Park. For the second game running, they created chances and looked like a threat going forward, but failed to win. It is now two wins in eight.",
      "Villa came out of the blocks quickly, as you would expect of a team on a run of nine successive wins. Ayden Heaven twice had to block shots from Ollie Watkins, Senne Lammens made a save from John McGinn and Rogers reacted quickly to flick an Ian Maatsen drive towards goal in the six-yard box, only to see it squirm just wide.",
      "United settled their rocking ship, however, and should have led by the midway point of the half. Benjamin Sesko found himself in on goal only to be denied by a sprawling save from Emiliano Martinez. A minute later, it was a clever pass from Matheus Cunha that sent Sesko in, but he took a heavy touch when trying to round Martinez, when he should have attempted to lift a first-time finish.",
      "In a stodgy half, it was Rogers and Cunha who had looked like making something happen, and they delivered within minutes of each other. Rogers had nothing on when he picked up possession on the left touchline, but Yoro never got close to the Premier League's in-form player and let him drift into a shooting position, from where he picked his spot clinically.",
      "Thankfully for United, Matty Cash was also in the Christmas spirit. He was caught napping by Patrick Dorgu, with the ball falling to Cunha. The Brazilian had plenty to do, but his unerring finish was measured to perfection.",
      "The half-time loss of Fernandes was a hammer blow for United. The captain had stopped the game after clutching his hamstring, but continued until the break. He even had a goal-bound shot blocked by Ezri Konsa in that period, but couldn't continue. It meant Amorim had to raid his threadbare bench and the promotion of Martinez to midfield showed what he thought of the other options available to him.",
      "Martinez settled into the game quickly, and United started the second half well, but were again undone by a moment of Rogers' magic. The finish was from a similar angle after the ball bounced clear to him, and again, Yoro was too cautious in trying to stop him. His two shots were worth a combined xG of 0.07 on the spreadsheet. Unfortunately for United, the game was being played on the pitch.",
      "The consolation for Amorim was that his team was being beaten by stunners. So stretched were resources that the Portuguese called a truce with the academy, handing out two debuts, with Jack Fletcher and Shea Lacey coming off the bench.",
      "Diogo Dalot forced Martinez into a save and Dorgu's follow-up was blocked by Cash. The recalled wing-back then stuck a cross on Cunha's head only for the Brazilian's effort to bounce wide. Lacey managed a shot on target from distance and Mount whipped a free-kick onto the roof of the net.",
      "It was an afternoon when United could count themselves a little unlucky, but the results are flatlining again. Casemiro will return on Boxing Day. Who partners him is anyone's guess.",

Ugarte has had a very shaky start, Fernandes pressing high and holding midfielder being run ragged at times. United have at least steadied the ship after a rocky opening.",

      "Dalot did well to bring the ball inside and play a pass over the top to Sesko, but it came to nothing.",
      "Mount has started really well and made a strong challenge just before.",
      "Villa just had three big chances. Lammens made a great save, Heaven made a superb block and Rogers came inches from scoring with a clever backheel. Villa have started full of energy and confidence.",
      "Watkins found it far too easy against Yoro but that was impressive from Heaven, bailing his central defensive partner out. Watkins and Rogers are in great form for Villa and United will have their work cut out. That is a major confidence boost for the youngest member of the defence."

      "Kobbie Mainoo is absent from the Manchester United squad at Aston Villa after he picked up an injury in the final training session before the trip to Villa Park. The injury is described as a \"small issue\", but it is enough to rule the academy graduate out of a game he might have started.",
      "Mainoo is yet to start a game in the Premier League this season and he is eyeing a loan move away from Old Trafford in January, but Ruben Amorim urged him to stay and fight for his place in his press conference ahead of the fixture against the league's in-form side.",
      "Amorim had hinted he could play a back four against Villa, a formation that would have meant three midfielders and would have resulted in an expected promotion for Mainoo, 20, with Casemiro suspended after picking up a fifth booking of the season.",
      "But his cruelly timed injury means he won't get to add to his 212 minutes of Premier League football so far this season. With Mainoo unavailable, Amorim has stuck by his 3-4-2-1 system.",
      "United are short of options with Noussair Mazraoui, Amad and Bryan Mbeumo away at the Africa Cup of Nations. Mainoo has joined Harry Maguire and Matthijs de Ligt on the treatment table.",
      "Amorim was asked about Mainoo during his press conference and urged him to accept his current predicament and prove him wrong, hinting he could be in the side against Villa.",
      "\"Kobbie needs to fight for his job. I think that is not a bad thing to be on the bench of Manchester United when you are 20 years old,\" he said. \"I remember Ronaldo was on the bench, Rooney was on the bench sometimes. Veron was not playing.",
      "\"So let's continue in trying to avoid the nonsense and the noise. I just want to help the team to win. To help Kobbie to be a better player. I'm not trying to say to Kobbie 'You are a big player here, let’s put him on the bench to show something.'",
      "\"No, no. What I’m saying is the opposite. I'm just not putting Kobe sometimes because I understand that this is not the right guy to start the game. Maybe the next game, Sunday he is going to start.",

      "Both semi-finals are on 14 January, with the final taking place four days later on 18 January. The third-place play-off is a day earlier than the final.",

      "Reaching the quarter-finals will see the forward away around the FA Cup third-round weekend. Further progression from there may endanger his involvement in the Manchester derby.",
      "A return in the New Year appears most likely for Harry Maguire. The defender has already missed a month after sustaining a hamstring injury in the 2-2 draw with Tottenham Hotspur.",
      "United have already gone six consecutive matches without their former captain. That could soon increase to eight if he is not back before the end of December.",
      "The visit to Leeds United on 4 January is a possible return date, with a trip to Burnley following three days later. Failing a comeback taking place in either of those fixtures, there is the FA Cup third round tie against Brighton & Hove Albion.",

He said: \"After the final session, he went to the doctor, and he got something in his calf, so we are going to assess, but he is out of this game [against Aston Villa]. He is going to be fine in a few weeks, I don't know.\"",
      "A few weeks means missing at least three and potentially as many as five matches. That also extends the player's absence into January, when the winter transfer window opens, meaning Mainoo could have already played his last game for United this season.",
      "Boxing Day could come too early for Matthijs de Ligt, but a return in their final match of 2026 appears possible. The Netherlands international has dealt with a back injury this month, missing United's last four games.",
      "After having to deploy Lisandro Martinez in midfield due to the absence of Bruno Fernandes, another defender's return would be welcome for Ruben Amorim. However, the team may well have to navigate one more match, against Newcastle United, before they can call on De Ligt once again.",
      "Being back for trips to Burnley and Leeds United would be a big boost. The defender should also then be up to speed for the Manchester derby.",
      "Africa Cup of Nations hosts Morocco kicked off the tournament with Noussair Mazraoui in their team on Sunday night. The defender assisted Brahim Diaz for the competition's opening goal after cutting the ball back for his teammate to fire home.",

      "Mazraoui missed Monday's match against Bournemouth after the Royal Moroccan Football Federation rejected a request from United to delay the player's departure. He could end up missing eight games in total as Morocco are the favourite to win the whole thing for the first time in 50 years."

      "Manchester United legend Gary Neville says Matheus Cunha had 'no excuse' to miss his second-half header from close range - an opportunity that would have drawn his team level for the second against Aston Villa.",
      "Cunha had already levelled the scoring on the stroke of half-time, moments after Morgan Rogers had struck to hand Villa the advantage. United's failure to deal with their hosts then saw the Englishman restore the lead at 2-1 with 32 minutes left on the clock.",
      "And again, shortly afterwards United's No.10 was presented with the chance to grab a second equaliser. With the freedom of the six-yard box, Cunha mishit a headed effort into the turf and it bounced the wrong side of the post.",
      "\"[It] had to be a goal. It's an absolutely brilliant pass from [Mason] Mount and a wonderful cross from [Patrick] Dorgu. On a plate.",
      "\"He's got no excuse, Cunha, he has to score.\"",
      "The Brazilian looked devastated that he had not managed to convert the opportunity, lying face down on the turf before his teammates arrived to pick him up both literally and figuratively.",
      "After his miss, United were still unable to muster a successful response in the time that remained and therefore lost the opportunity to move level on points with fourth-placed Chelsea following their slip-up at Newcastle United over 24 hours earlier.",
      "Adding comment at full-time, Roy Keane added: \"This is where football drives you mad.",
      "\"Absolutely brilliant delivery, as soon as it leaves his foot you're thinking [this is going to be a goal], and then there's no logic to it. We can't even explain it.",
      "\"We were saying here it is easier than a penalty. He's got five, six yards. Only the player maybe could explain it, whether he's lost concentration as it's coming onto his head?",
      "\"Sometimes for a player it is too easy. On target and it's a goal. Another big moment for United.\"",

      "Diogo Dalot couldn't offer an update on the severity of Bruno Fernandes' injury when he spoke after the Aston Villa defeat. Fernandes picked up an injury in the first half of the game at Villa Park but managed to see out the remainder of the opening 45 minutes before being replaced at half time.",
      "Having recently lost Amad, Bryan Mbeumo and Noussair Mazraoui to the Africa Cup of Nations, Amorim was handed another injury blow on Saturday when Kobbie Mainoo picked up a knock in training. The injury picked up by Fernandes on Sunday only adds to the manager's selection problems during the hectic festive period.",
      "Two goals from Morgan Rogers ensured United came away from their trip to Villa Park with no points. Dalot was asked whether United were aware of the threat the in-form Rogers would pose, saying: \"Yeah, we knew that they could try to find Morgan in the wide areas and then they would do movements to attract the space and he could drive the ball inside - I think we could have avoided those types of movements. But I think we did enough to score more goals, we couldn't take the chances that we had.\"",
      "Shea Lacey and Jack Fletcher both made their debuts on Sunday, with fellow academy starlet Bendito Mantato also named on the bench at Villa Park. Dalot was asked about how the number of absentees will impact United over the coming weeks, saying: \"This is the time when opportunities come for other players and you have to step up and show you deserve to be in the team and play more minutes. I think that's how the players who get opportunities need to look at it.\"",

      "When asked whether Mainoo would have started, Amorim said: \"I prefer not to say, not just because of the player who is going to play this evening. Now it is easy to say… he knows, and that is enough.” In the absence of Casemiro, Harry Maguire, Matthijs de Ligt, Bryan Mbeumo, Amad and Noussair Mazraoui, Amorim has named four players from the academy on the bench.",

And we are going to help them to help the team.\"",
      "\"Even with all the players, all the squad, it would be a really tough match. They are in a very good moment, but we are also prepared for anything. And we proved that maybe in the tougher matches we can step up, and today we want to do that.\"",
      "Amorim added: “We need to try to put the players in different places with different characteristics, but it’s not going to change too much because we have a way of playing, we are attacking really well, we need to defend better so we will try to do that with different characteristics.",

      "Ruben Amorim has told Kobbie Mainoo to stay and \"fight for his job\" at Manchester United, telling the academy graduate to follow the example of Wayne Rooney and Cristiano Ronaldo, who both had spells on the bench but knuckled down to fight for their Old Trafford futures.",
      "Mainoo is yet to start a Premier League game this season and could leave on loan next month, with Napoli at the head of a long list of suitors for his signature, but Amorim wants the academy graduate to stay and fight instead. Amorim took aim at the club legends telling Mainoo to leave on Friday and has now directed his message to the 20-year-old, who is frustrated at a lack of playing time at Old Trafford and is becoming a cause celebre among supporters, who are desperate to see one of their own playing more often.",
      "\"Kobbie needs to fight for his job. I think that is not a bad thing to be on the bench of Manchester United when you are 20 years old,\" said Amorim. \"I remember Ronaldo was on the bench, Rooney was on the bench sometimes. [Juan Sebastian] Veron was not playing. I remember all the history of Manchester United and nobody. So let's continue in trying to avoid the nonsense and the noise. I just want to help the team win. To help Kobbie to be a better player.\"",
      "Amorim insisted he wasn't using Mainoo to make a point that big players must earn their stripes at Old Trafford and accept a spell on the bench, but that he must prove the head coach wrong when he gets a chance. Mainoo could earn a first league start of the season at Aston Villa on Sunday, with Amorim confirming he is considering a switch to a back four, which could offer Mainoo a route into the team as one of three midfielders.",
      "If he does get the chance, then Amorim urged the young midfielder to use his anger as fuel to show everyone what he can do. \"I’m not trying to say to Kobbie, 'You are a big player here, let’s put him on the bench to show something',\" he said.",
      "\"No, no. What I’m saying is the opposite. I'm just not putting Kobbie sometimes because I understand that this is not the right guy to start the game. Maybe the next game, on Sunday, he is going to start.",
      "\"If he plays well, he's going to show everyone. 'This guy cannot take me from the team', and I will be so happy, so I don't care. I don't want to show nothing to anyone. I'm just saying that I'm trying to win games and to show to the players that if you do the things right, you will play no matter what the name.\"",
      "A week ago Amorim told Mainoo to come and see him if he wanted a loan move in January. That didn't happen and Mainoo's future took another turn on Monday, when half-brother Jordan wore a t-shirt saying 'Free Kobbie Mainoo' to the game against Bournemouth.",
      "\"He’s a shy boy, but it's not his responsibility. He's responsible for his acts and his act was to play well in the last game, I'm just focused on that,\" said Amorim.",
      "\"I had the situation in Sporting (Lisbon) that my brother wrote something on the internet, and I have to answer for that. My explanation is that he has his life, he has his opinion, and it's nothing to do with me. So I will do the same with Kobbie.\"",

      "In addition to United, Manchester City, Liverpool, and Tottenham are also interested in signing the 25-year-old. Amorim labelled Semenyo a \"special player\" before United's 4-4 draw with Bournemouth on Monday and saw first hand how dangerous he can be, with the Ghana international netting his seventh goal of the season.",
      "He is a versatile forward and could be used at wing-back if United land their man, although they will face fierce competition to do so next month. United have recently lost three players to the Africa Cup of Nations, but Amorim confirmed that there will be short-term moves next month and hinted that any deal could be in a position that isn't necessarily the top priority.",
      "While United are planning a midfield rebuild for 2026, they are bringing a move for Semenyo forward because of the expectation he will leave Bournemouth in January.",
      "\"The only thing that we know is that we only would try to bring players that we think is going to be the future,\" said Amorim. \"It's not going to be to save something in this moment, to cope with the losses of three players for AFCON.",

      "Manchester United's starting line-up vs Aston Villa on Sunday will be a lot different to the side which drew 4-4 with Bournemouth on Monday night. Noussair Mazraoui was already missing from that team as he linked up with his Morocco teammates ahead of the Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON).",
      "However, he will be joined on the absentee list by Amad and Bryan Mbeumo. They were given special allowance by their national teams to play against the Cherries but will not be available for selection when the team travel to Villa on Sunday. But if that was not enough for Ruben Amorim, there is another matter to contend with.",
      "United shall also be without the services of Casemiro in the West Midlands this weekend. The Brazilian picked up his fifth booking of the campaign, not including the two he received against Chelsea, on Monday night and will therefore be suspended for one game.",
      "His absence leaves a hole in the midfield which will need to be plugged by the Reds. With this in mind, MEN Sport has taken a look at three ways United could choose to line-up in the absence of Casemiro.",
      "United could simply decide to make a straight swap with Casemiro dropping out for Manuel Ugarte. Many predicted the Uruguayan would have a bigger role at Old Trafford once Amorim arrived considering their history together at Sporting.",
      "Instead, Ugarte has failed to push on and has dropped behind Casemiro in the pecking order. This would have been inconceivable at one stage considering the Brazilian was so far off the pace in the Premier League last season.",
      "But in 2025/26, Casemiro remains the best option in defensive midfielder and there is little chance his suspension will damage his chances of returning to the Boxing Day squad vs Newcastle.",
      "There is a lot of talk about whether United are ready to play with four at the back considering the number of absentees - especially against Villa. One option available to Amorim is to return to a 4-3-3 formation which the Reds, and this group of players, have used previously.",
      "Amorim has stated Kobbie Mainoo could feature more in such a system. Should this be the case, Amorim could kill two birds with one stone and ease the tension surrounding the academy graduate's playing time this season while also finding a way around the Casemiro headache.",
      "Without Casemiro, there would still be a place for Ugarte in this formation and both he and Mainoo would benefit from three players in that midfield.",
      "The wildcard option for United would depend entirely on whether or not Amorim is ready to change his mind entirely. Lisandro Martinez has played as a defensive midfielder before - for Ajax when Erik ten Hag was struggling for numbers in that position.",
      "Amorim stated recently he did not see Martinez as a midfielder as he is not taking on that workload currently. Since his long-term injury, the Argentine has been focusing on being a defender but if Ugarte is not seen as a viable option, Martinez could be utilised there.",
      "He could play as the anchor just ahead of the centre-backs which would once again allow Mainoo an opportunity to impress. However, it seems obvious this is a long shot considering Amorim's recent comments on Martinez.",

      "It came as a surprise to supporters when watching the game, as the starting line-up appeared to point towards a back five, but the side shuffled into more of a four during the match.",
      "That is despite head coach Ruben Amorim being insistent over the first year or so of his tenure that he would not change, having previously made his stance clear in the media over a move from the five to a four.",
      "He said: \"No one. Not even the Pope will change [his tactics]. This is my job. This is my responsibility. This is my life. So, I will not change that.\"",

      "\"Has he changed it...? The last 20 minutes he was definitely 4-4-2, 4-2-4, but in the first part of the game, there was something definitely different that had been identified earlier in the week.",
      "\"Apparently, United are a bit annoyed, basically it's leaked out that he's gonna change to a 4-4-2 or a 4-3-3. He was emphatic about not changing, and we've all asked for him to change and be agile. Where are we now in respect to, there's no doubt on Monday he changed.\"",
      "Kitbag has slashed the price of Man United kits and merch with up to 50% off select items.",
      "There were times in the match where United looked back to the team of old, before the habits of recent years snuck back into it, but it's a promising signal for many that the head coach is willing to make those small tactical tweaks.",
      "While many believed there were changes, Bournemouth's boss Andoni Iraola seemed less certain, as he said after the game: \"I think it's the same system they always play, but they adapt depending on who you put to mark them. In the end, it's a very flexible system.",
      "\"Depending on the players, the outside players, depending if you mark them with a full-back, they will go lower, and then with a winger, they go higher.",
      "\"Also, with the positions in the middle, the six and eight, Casemiro and Bruno Fernandes and - even us - we were changing, it's two against two, but it's not two against two.",
      "\"Until we match up well for us, I think we suffer in the first 15 or 20 minutes, something like this and after when we put Alex [Scott] there, we felt much more solid without the ball. And when you feel solid, normally you also attack better.\"",
      "Considering United's upcoming AFCON absentees, it remains to be seen whether the side will continue with those tactical tweaks or if it was a rare change that may not be seen again.",

      "Roy Keane has called for Kobbie Mainoo to force his way into the Manchester United team, rather than exploring other opportunities amid ongoing speculation surrounding his future at Old Trafford.",
      "Mainoo's future at United has been the subject of debate since the summer. The England international asked to leave the club on loan towards the end of the transfer window, but United didn't sanction the move.",
      "The 20-year-old has played just 11 Premier League games under Ruben Amorim this season, all coming off the bench. His only start in this campaign came in the EFL Cup defeat to League Two side Grimsby Town in August.",
      "Earlier this week, Mainoo's half-brother, Jordan Mainoo-Hames, sparked controversy for wearing a 'free Kobbie Mainoo' T-shirt during the 4-4 draw with AFC Bournemouth. Mainoo came on with under 30 minutes left, his third-longest runout in the league this season, in a thriller at Old Trafford.",
      "Mainoo-Hames posted the image on his Instagram page, and it has led to more questions about the midfielder's future and attitude. Speaking on the Stick to Football podcast, Keane labelled the stunt idiotic and urged Mainoo to work to get into the squad.",
      "\"Are you telling me that he can't sit there for another six months? He might think the manager's on his way out in the summer,\" Keane said. \"He's 20 years of age, what's wrong with sitting and learning your trade? And even if he's not getting a chance, we've all had to do it.",
      "\"Sometimes a manager is on your case and what you have to do is prove them wrong. Jamie made a point that he never felt like a regular at Liverpool, I never felt like that at United. Every day is your chance to prove yourself to the manager and when the manager is picking his team, [he goes] 'he has to play'. He's got to get that in his mindset.",
      "\"And when he's got his idiot of a brother doing all that... we shouldn't even be giving that kind of stuff the time of day. Sometimes you're just surrounded by idiots, especially the families.\"",
      "Keane added on Mainoo's future at United: \"What's football about? The life of a footballer is about trying to prove people wrong. There was chat about Bruno [Fernandes] leaving the summer, he might leave next summer. Bide your time.",
      "\"I have no problem players going out on loan, it can work for everybody, but sometimes as a player, your biggest challenge is here at Man United and getting into that first-team. Even if the manager is saying 'you're not going to get in over Bruno', prove them wrong!\"",
      "Despite the noise around Mainoo, Amorim has refused to say whether a loan moan would be sanctioned. \"I had some conversations with him, especially last year, and with other players, but about that subject, no, I didn't speak with him,\" he said.",
      "\"I will be really pleased if Kobbie comes to talk to me about that. I just want my players happy. I understand every individual has their goals and the frustration doesn't help anybody. I'm not going to say what I would say but I would talk to him.",
      "\"I am completely open, that is clear. I have my ideas and that is also clear. I will not change if I don't believe it but I'm open to speak with any player. I love that.\"",

However, he would still not be available for the Manchester derby on January 17 as that date falls on the third-placed playoff - which Ivory Coast are predicted to lose to Uganda on penalties.",
      "Therefore, the prediction reckons Amad is also likely to return at a similar time to Mazraoui for the Arsenal game in late January.",
      "In what could be the tournament's biggest upset, Egypt and their star player Mohamed Salah are predicted to fall to Comoros with a 1-0 loss in the round of 16.",
      "South Africa and Algeria, both of whom have qualified for next year's World Cup, are expected to reach the quarter-finals, while Tunisia, another World Cup participant, is predicted to miss out on the knockout stages.",
      "Amorim is going to have to find a solution with Mbeumo, Amad and Mazraoui out for the foreseeable future and former United defender Paul Parker believes it will be a very difficult task.",
      "He said: \"It is impossible for Man United to cope with the loss of Mbeumo when he leaves for the AFCON. They simply can't. They have no one close to his level, so they will struggle without him.",
      "\"He is going to be a massive miss, and I can't see how they can do anything without him. We have to remember that he is one of the best players in the league, and he is definitely the best player from Manchester United.",
      "\"He is seriously scary on that right hand side, but who should replace him? Amad Diallo is gone as well. Will they play Mason Mount or Zirkzee there? Gosh, I can't imagine how that is going to look.\"",
      "\"Of course, Amad will be a massive miss as well,\" Parker added. \"Man United might have to change their whole approach, because nothing will come from that right hand side without them. Amad is a big threat and we can see that in every game. No one is able to take on their opponent like him, so no one can replace him.",
      "\"Combined with both of them being out, that is going to be a nightmare. It will be a true nightmare, and I don't really have faith that other players can step up to their level, which is normally expected at a big club like Manchester United.\"",

      "Kobbie Mainoo's famous brother made a bold statement against Ruben Amorim by donning a controversial T-shirt at Manchester United's Premier League match against Bournemouth – marking yet another instance of the midfielder's celebrity sibling stirring things up at Old Trafford.",
      "Mainoo has found himself out of favour with manager Amorim amidst speculation of a possible departure in January. The England international has been absent from the starting eleven for all of United's 16 league games this season, his only start being in the Red Devils' humiliating Carabao Cup loss to Grimsby.",
      "The 20-year-old appeared to have the world at his feet following a standout 2023/24 season under Erik ten Hag, during which he netted the decisive goal in the FA Cup final against Manchester City and became an integral part of the England team that reached the Euros final.",
      "However, since Amorim took the reins at Old Trafford, things have taken a turn for the worse for the Stockport-born academy product, with United icon Paul Scholes among those advising Mainoo to leave his childhood club in pursuit of more playing time. Reports suggest that Mainoo was eager to move to Napoli over the summer but had his request denied.",
      "Despite his limited game time, the young player received a warm welcome from the Old Trafford crowd on Monday when he came on for Casemiro just after the hour mark during United's thrilling 4-4 draw with Bournemouth. However, post-match attention swiftly shifted to a provocative comment made by his brother at the side of the pitch.",
      "Jordan Mainoo-Hames, 30, was spotted in the front row sporting a black T-shirt bearing the message \"Free Kobbie Mainoo\", a move with the potential to exacerbate an already tense situation. The act has divided United's fanbase, with some accusing Mainoo's relative of unnecessary provocation, while others see it as a legitimate protest.",
      "Mainoo's elder sibling may be a familiar face to many – the fashion model and influencer featured on the 2019 series of popular reality TV show Love Island and has since garnered over 680,000 followers on Instagram.",
      "His name will also resonate within Old Trafford. Speaking at an England training camp, Mainoo disclosed that his brother's time on Love Island had resulted in him being given an unusual moniker.",
      "He stated: \"My brother was on it. I am close to him. You know what, going back to another question – my nickname. The kit man at United always called me 'Love Island'. He's been doing so since I was like 16.\"",

    "body": [
      "Senne Lammens wore a polo shirt and a navy sweatshirt when he visited Old Trafford after signing for Manchester United. The young goalkeeper looked as though he could be joining United to work in their HR department.",
      "The same observation was made when Lammens reported for international duty with Belgium last week - the 23-year-old was dressed in a beige collared jacket, a khaki t-shirt and chinos.",
      "\"By accident, I saw an article saying he was wearing something boring when he reported for international duty and fans saying they hoped he stays like this,\" laughed Hayk Milkon, one of Lammens' former coaches.",
      "\"This 'boringness' is just the way Senne is, he's really calm and no excesses. He focuses on what he needs to focus on and is open with the people around him. He keeps his feet on the ground.\"",
      "If Lammens looks like someone who could work in an office, every workplace would love to have him in their five-a-side team. United believe they have signed a young goalkeeper with huge potential, and fans who were present at Old Trafford against Sunderland left the stadium buzzing about his debut.",
      "The quirk is that Lammens appears to be a different person when he wears his goalkeeper kit. He made a supremely confident United debut, aggressively commanded his area and kept a clean sheet.",
      "Milkon coached Lammens during their time together at Club Brugge. Milkon is now the youngest manager in the Belgian top-flight and Lammens plays for the biggest club in England.",
      "\"It was Senne with his headphones on. He would go into the gym to do his recovery or some extra top-ups. Or he would just go to relax by playing basketball - he loved to play basketball.\"",
      "Milkon coached in different roles at Club Brugge. He was the assistant of Club NXT (their reserve team), served as their interim manager, was in charge of the Under-18s and eventually became a first-team coach.",
      "His time at Club Brugge coincided with Lammens progressing from the academy to their first team, so he is uniquely positioned to provide insight into United's new goalkeeper signing.",
      "Lammens joined Club Brugge's academy when he was 12. \"He was a guy with huge potential,\" said Milkon. \"As I learned from colleagues who had worked with him when he was much younger, I heard there was a moment that clicked in his head when he became super professional.",
      "\"He was one of the guys during Covid - when the players were not able to train - who was doing a lot at home, he was really going far with this to be the best in these types of areas.",
      "\"Then he continued like this when he joined the first team to train with them. He always wanted to improve. We also had something in place to look at the parameters on which goalkeepers are judged.",
      "\"You see the potential of the goalkeeper based on what they do in games; so their positioning, their decision-making and so on, and Senne was always quite high in these areas.",
      "\"The only bad luck that he had was that the first-team goalkeeper was Simon Mignolet. He's an amazing goalkeeper, so it was difficult for Senne to stay over there in the role of No.2.",
      "\"That would have also blocked his growth, so it was good for him in the end to make the step to go to Antwerp and he did a tremendous job there. It was amazing to see how fast he adapted.\"",
      "Milkon continued: \"I think for us at Club Brugge, it was very clear to everyone that Senne was a top goalkeeper. He would have been the perfect fit for Club Brugge to be the No.1.",
      "\"That was not possible because Mignolet was there. But the parameters that we used to judge his performances indicated he was ticking so many boxes already, and he was consistently doing it.",
      "\"There weren't ups and downs with his performances. He was consistently really high and when you compare this to the top goalkeepers, you have a benchmark to say 'Ok, what potential does this guy have?'",
      "\"He had some chances with the first team at Club Brugge and made a mistake, or maybe two, but in the end it was very clear to everyone that he was a top goalkeeper.",
      "\"It was impossible to try to extend his contract because, again, you have Mignolet, and you cannot block a guy like this. You know he has to go out, he has to play, and he will improve even more.\"",
      "When asked about Lammens' strengths, he said: \"I would say that his decision-making was very good. He is very calm, he sees the solutions on the pitch, he has a quick reaction time and understands the balance between risk and reward, and which decisions are the right ones to make.",
      "\"His clean passing is great, his footwork was really good, and he's just an amazing goalkeeper with the shot-stopping. He made some incredible saves back then already. He's quite a complete goalkeeper.",
      "\"But making the right decisions at a very young age, being very mature with this, was really impressive. And the fact that he is good with both feet is another big strength.",
      "\"For me, Senne is a very calm guy and has all the qualities to be a top professional. That was my impression when I first met him when he was younger and he never changed.\"",
      "Lammens joined Royal Antwerp on a free transfer in the summer of 2023. He was handed his debut a few months later and served as an understudy that season, but earned first-choice status for 2024/2025.",
      "His performances drew attention from the Belgian media. Lammens saved four penalties across a successful first full campaign and received a call-up to Belgium's senior squad in March.",
      "Milkon said: \"I was not surprised when I saw Manchester United had come calling. And to record his first clean sheet, I was really happy for him. Senne is a potential No.1 for the Red Devils - the Belgium national team.",
      "\"He got his chance, he took it, and we're all really proud of him, but we knew it would happen. I believe he has all the capabilities to become the best in the world, so I wish him all the best. I'm sure he will have a very good career in England, and Manchester United should return to the big club they used to be.",
      "\"He will have a positive impact on that, for sure, and hopefully he will be Belgium's first-choice goalkeeper soon. I believe he has the potential, the skillset and the personality to do that.",
      "\"For me, it was just having a tiny little part in having an influence on him at Brugge, but it was the most positive memories of our relationship that we had during this spell.",
      "\"I'm very proud that he is reaching these high levels and not surprised. I believe he will be successful because he is a guy who will not change his focus or start to do something different. He is calm, that's his personality and character, and he wants to succeed. He is hungry and will keep working to be his best.",
      "\"He is so calm, and you have to be patient in football. You cannot worry too much and want things too early, but finding the balance between not being impatient and, at the same time, pushing and demanding what you deserve in a good way, means everything will sort itself out.\"",
      "United staff who have worked with Lammens at Carrington have echoed Milkon's sentiments. He has been described as \"really mature for his age\" and is said to have taken the move in his stride.",
      "Lammens is understood to have impressed coaches during training sessions and a United source said that lots of people have been speaking positively about him. He has already relocated from the luxury hotel where he was initially staying and into a house.",
      "It's no surprise that Lammens likes to play basketball at 6ft 3in, but he is a keen golfer, which is common ground with the likes of Tom Heaton, Luke Shaw, Mason Mount and Harry Maguire.",
      "Matthijs de Ligt, Amad, Maguire and Shaw jogged straight to Lammens to congratulate him after full-time against Sunderland. \"Are you Schmeichel in disguise?\" was chanted at Lammens from the Stretford End.",
      "It remains to be seen whether Lammens will start against Liverpool on Sunday, but it would be a surprise to see him on the bench after delivering a strong debut before the international break.",
      "There would be nothing boring about keeping another clean sheet - this time at Anfield.",
      "Kitbag has slashed the price of Man United kits and merch with up to 50% off select items.",

      "Aston Villa ended a year in which they’ve turned Villa Park into a fortress with victory over the one team that has never had reason to fear a trip here.",
      "Morgan Rogers’ double in a hard-fought 2-1 victory keeps Villa – who were not at their best – on the tails of Arsenal and Man City at the top of the table and perhaps (but only perhaps) more significantly extends their lead over any other Champions League chaser to a chasm-like seven points.",
      "Unai Emery and his side really are on the road to something special, while there was encouragement, frustration and a brand new quandary for Ruben Amorim.",
      "",
      "1. For all but the youngest Man United fans, there will have been something uncannily familiar about this game. An away team coming to a team on a formidable winning run and throwing absolutely everything at them, arguably having the better of the game on the balance of the 90 minutes, and then going home with absolutely nothing.",
      "Old Trafford saw more games like this than any of care to remember in the 1990s and 2000s. That Villa Park is now the venue for such behaviour really is quite something. For the first time since before that era of United dominance – before the invention of football in 1992 even – Villa have won seven top-flight matches in a row. Things are happening here.",
      "",
      "2. It shouldn’t really need reaffirming about a team that’s just won seven in a row – and 11 in 12 – but Aston Villa absolutely are in a title race now right up until they aren’t. What’s happened since the late winner against Arsenal goes against all narrative tradition for the unexpected team that suddenly inserts itself into a title situation with a thunderously significant and dramatic victory over a team that in that one moment suddenly becomes a direct rival.",
      "Falling behind at West Ham last weekend could have ended the title charge as soon as it began. The visit of a Man United team that had lost to Villa here once in 30 years could have ended the title charge. But on Villa go.",
      "If we can still talk about them as we are now in nine days’ time after trips to Stamford Bridge and the Emirates…",
      "",
      "3. What’s absolutely true for now, though, is that Villa have placed themselves into a leading pack with Arsenal and City – on merit – and thoroughly distanced themselves from the chasing pack. The gap to fourth place is now seven points. It’s an astonishing position they find themselves in, especially after the way the season started with the now-infamous five-match streak without a win – four matches without even so much as a goal.",
      "Wins for Arsenal and City on Saturday denied Villa the chance to hurt them, but Chelsea’s dropped points at Newcastle offered the chance to put real distance between them and the chasing pack. Taking that chance in the manner they did must be enormously pleasing for Unai Emery and his team.",
      "",
      "4. Hardly revelatory to highlight Morgan Rogers as the star attraction here. Two stunning goals added to a collection of stunning goals this season, Leny Yoro given an absolute torrid, and a first-half trick duly repeated in the second.",
      "He is the main reason Villa’s title challenge might have some legs. Villa are a very good side expertly trained and prepared by a brilliant manager; that puts them in position to do something special. But the kind of special they’re now in position to dream of requires individual players of individual brilliance within that rock-solid framework.",
      "Villa would still be a good team without Rogers, but they wouldn’t be viable title contenders or anything like it. With the possible exception of Emi Martinez, we’re not sure that’s true of any other single player. Rogers is the difference maker for Villa, a man who produces moments like these to turn what was by their own now lofty standards a sub-par overall performance into three more points against an avowed bogey team.",
      "",
      "5. Rogers also produces these moments when they really count, too. These were his first Villa Park goals of this Premier League season, but this is more praise than criticism. All his other goals in the league this season have come in victories from behind away from home. Vital goals at vital times in the toughest situations.",
      "That applies just as much here, with both his goals sublime on their own aesthetic and technical level but also coming at vital times where Villa appeared to be second best.",
      "",
      "6. That fact will be only part of what frustrates Ruben Amorim about what was genuinely one of his more impressive games as Man United manager; for all Rogers’ brilliance with both goals they were also avoidable from a United point of view.",
      "Yoro had a desperately poor game in a generally sound United effort achieved despite great adversity. Yoro’s futile struggle to get to grips with Rogers was a key contributor to both goals, but especially the first.",
      "",
      "7. There’s no real shame in being beaten by the threat and talent Rogers possesses; but there is in apparently being unaware of its existence.",
      "With time ticking down in a first half United had rather impressively controlled, John McGinn fizzed a thigh-high pass out from midfield to Rogers on the left. His first touch was good enough to keep the ball alive but no more.",
      "Yet as Rogers buzzed over towards the touchline to retrieve it, Yoro merely ambled in that general direction. By the time Rogers had danced inside onto his right foot and curled a shot inside Senne Lammens’ far post, Yoro still hadn’t twigged what was happening. Still hadn’t got close enough to even pressure the shot, never mind actually prevent or block it.",
      "It takes nothing away from the brilliance of everything Rogers did to note he was given a bizarre helping hand by some astonishingly passive defending against Villa’s most conspicuous threat.",
      "",
      "8. And then it all happened again, in much the same way and in with the general flow of the match at that point feeling much the same. Absolutely maddening for Amorim.",
      "",
      "9. If only for the obvious reason that the United boss had got so much right. A great deal of it was firmly in ‘needs must’ territory but that is often the fire where the greatest solutions are forged.",
      "With Casemiro suspended and Kobbie Mainoo unavailable through injury, Manuel Ugarte was handed a start in United’s midfield almost by default.",
      "His jarring lack of quality on the ball remains a massive issue, and there was one conspicuous moment in the first half where Youri Tielemans picked his pocket all too easily, but he did at least perform a semi-functional destroyer’s role as the deepest point of a midfield triangle that, in the first half at least, featured Mason Mount and Bruno Fernandes as its more advanced corners.",
      "",
      "10. This is not the first time in recent weeks that Amorim has moved away slightly from his trademark rigid and unshakeable adherence to 3-4-3 and it is most welcome. The acknowledgement that more bodies were needed in the middle of the park against an opponent of Villa’s quality is a sign of self-awareness. That’s a strength, not a weakness.",
      "And it worked, it really did. It might be a stretch to say United dominated the first half, but they certainly controlled it, and went in deservedly level after Matheus Cunha profited from Patrick Dorgu’s good work in for once pressuring Villa into a mistake as they looked to play through the United press.",
      "Matty Cash is so often such a reliable conduit for Emi Martinez to start such proceedings, but was badly caught out this time.",
      "",
      "11. Yet by the time of those goals at the end of the first half, another potentially seismic moment for United’s whole season had already occurred. Bruno Fernandes picked up a muscle injury. It cannot be overstated what a big deal that is, both in its potential impact on United’s season and sheer rocking-horse-shit rareness.",
      "Fernandes is that rare player seemingly capable of just playing all the football all the time with almost no ill-effects. Indeed, he seemed so perplexed by the entire concept of doing a hammy that he was unwilling to accept it had happened. Or perhaps unaware of what that painful sensation in his leg even was.",
      "He limped and laboured on until half-time despite it being obvious to every single other person among the 40,000 inside Villa Park what had just happened.",
      "",
      "12. His half-time withdrawal marked just the third time he had failed to reach 90 minutes in a Premier League game this season. In the previous two he came off after 85 and 87 minutes.",
      "He has cleared the 3000-minute mark in the Premier League alone in each of his five full seasons at United. He has never missed more than two Premier League games in a season through injury.",
      "In all he has featured in 212 out of 221 Manchester United league games since joining in the January transfer window of 2020. It’s a remarkable effort.",
      "And if today’s injury is anything like what it looked like – and Amorim did not sound at all cheery about it post-match – then he and United could be entering whole new territory.",
      "",
      "13. Every crisis presents an opportunity, though. This freakishly unusual Fernandes setback was spectacularly ill-timed for United and Amorim. As the United boss scoured a substitutes’ bench denuded by AFCON, injuries and suspensions, he will have seen precious little option.",
      "One was Joshua Zirkzee, the only outfielder among the United replacements to have started a game in the Premier League this season. That was the obvious option, but an imperfect one for the task at hand given United were level at what is currently the toughest ground to visit in the country and had secured their foothold in the game on the back of winning that midfield battle.",
      "",
      "14. Amorim went for Plan B and Lisandro Martinez, himself on the road back from serious injury but with midfield experience from his Ajax days. He did a fine job. The orientation of the triangle altered slightly; there were now two deeper-lying points in Ugarte and Martinez with Mount more advanced.",
      "If one wanted to be mischievous, one might suggest Martinez’s 45 minutes in the role offered a more compelling case than Ugarte’s 73 before he duly made way for Zirkzee as United chased another equaliser.",
      "At the very least, Martinez has put himself into the conversation should Fernandes’ absence be a lengthy one. He might even have got himself a goal and you’d certainly be surprised now to see Amorim revert back to his previous midfield shape for future games in and around this tariff of difficulty.",
      "",
      "15. The other obvious opportunity comes for Mason Mount. His whole Man United career has been defined by Bruno Fernandes’ sheer reliability in terms of both appearances and output. Even in recent weeks when he has proved rather nicely that he absolutely can play alongside United’s star man it has been in a support-act kind of way.",
      "But with Mount playing the best football of his United career in that time and now seeing the field quite literally cleared for him, we do wonder. He’s something of a forgotten man but 2026 could yet prove a big one for him with both club and country; we know Thomas Tuchel doesn’t need much excuse to call up players he knows he can trust, and few Englishmen are more firmly inside that particular circle than Mount.",
      "",
      "16. The final word has to go to Villa, though, who have completed an extraordinary year with an extraordinary set of home numbers. In all competitions they played 27 games at Villa Park in 2025. They won 22, drew four and lost only one.",
      "Among the teams beaten here this year have been both their current title rivals, six of the other seven members in all of what we’ll reluctantly and frankly inaccurately label the Big Eight, as well as the literal best team in Europe.",
      "And it really does set up the possibility of 2026 being even more memorable."

      "On Sunday afternoon, Man Utd suffered a narrow 2-1 defeat against Aston Villa via a stunning brace by England international Morgan Rogers.",
      "Ruben Amorim‘s team were the better side for large portions of this game, but they lacked cutting edge and were punished for a couple of defensive errors.",

      "Man Utd were short on options before the match against Villa, but Fernandes’ injury worsens their situation. He was taken off at the interval after appearing to pull his hamstring.",
      "Fernandes will be a big loss as seventh-placed Man Utd look to close in on the Champions League positions, but Amorim has indicated that his side are moving in the right direction and were the “better team” against Villa.",

      "“We already knew that Aston Villa play with everybody inside and we needed to overload that situation. We have been training like that. We did different options, we can use different starting elevens depending on the game, so we are improving. Again I think we deserved so much more today but the better team did not win.”",
      "On Fernandes’ injury: “It is really strange. During this year, especially at this time, we have so many problems, but we have to cope with that. I think Fletcher did his first game, so that is good news, Lacey the same, so we will try to find solutions and go for the next game.",

      "As Ruben Amorim looked on the brink of the sack after Manchester United’s loss against Brentford in September, a key factor behind his exit would have been his blank refusal to adapt to get the best out of his squad.",
      "This same issue contributed to Man Utd‘s damaging 1-0 home loss to 10-man Everton, with his side’s attack held back by the rigid focus on the head coach’s 3-4-3 formation.",
      "However, in recent weeks, Amorim has finally relented, with the tweaks to his formation and playing style bearing fruit for the Red Devils.",
      "The absences of Bryan Mbeumo, Amad Diallo and Noussair Mazraoui due to the African Cup of Nations, on top of Man Utd’s issues with injuries and suspensions, have somewhat forced Amorim’s hand, but it has seen him proactively find solutions to nullify opponents and maximise the output from the players at his disposal.",
      "There was more evidence of this against in-form Aston Villa, who went into Sunday’s game on a run of nine straight wins in all competitions, as Amorim opted to match Unai Emery’s side with more bodies than usual in the middle of the pitch.",
      "Man Utd supporters would have let out an audible gulp upon seeing Manuel Ugarte in the starting XI against Villa, with the club losing all of the last six Premier League games when the £42m flop has started.",
      "Before the game, we speculated that this could be Ugarte’s final chance to prevent a January transfer, and the declining midfielder, who is desperately poor in possession, failed to take his latest opportunity.",
      "Despite this, Man Utd still won the midfield battle in the first half and dominated against a flat Villa, with Bruno Fernandes, Mason Mount and Matheus Cunha overpowering their opponents.",
      "READ: Who will sign Semenyo in January and what will the four rejected sides, including Man Utd, do instead?",
      "The two sides exchanged decent chances in the opening ten minutes before Man Utd took control of the game, but it was Aston Villa who took the lead.",
      "It was a goal that really came from nowhere, with man of the moment Morgan Rogers producing his latest of many stunning solo goals.",
      "Rogers left onlookers gushing just from keeping the ball in play with a couple of sublime touches following John McGinn’s well-hit crossfield pass, but he did not stop there. With the help of Leny Yoro, who Gary Neville said was “ambling” in a “big mistake” as he carelessly opted against keeping the Englishman on his weaker left foot, he drifted inside and curled home a sensational effort into the far top corner.",
      "It would have been harsh on Man Utd if they trailed at the break, and they didn’t as Matty Cash was punished for being sloppy, with Patrick Dorgy alert to challenge the right-back and set up Matheus Cunha, who clinically converted past Emiliano Martinez from inside the penalty area.",
      "Amorim cannot be faulted for his role as his changes saw Man Utd get the better of Aston Villa for large portions of the day, though he and his side are hamstrung by key players being unavailable.",
      "Their bench against Aston Villa included two goalkeepers and five youngsters, with their situation worsened by captain Bruno Fernandes appearing to pull his hamstring.",
      "Amorim stuck to his working system as Lisandro Martinez replaced Fernandes in midfield at half time, with Man Utd’s weak bench further evidenced by Joshua Zirkzee and teenager Jack Fletcher being their next two substitutions.",
      "Despite this, the game’s flow after the interval was similar to the first half as Man Utd had the better of the action, though Aston Villa’s great equaliser proved the difference.",
      "Villa are the form team in the Premier League, but they struggled to hit their usual heights against bogey team Man Utd and had to rely on the brilliance of Rogers to get them over the line.",
      "His second goal was never going to be as good as his first, but it was a strong follow-up; he latched onto a loose ball in the penalty area following good play from Ollie Watkins and Youri Tielemans and curled home into the corner of the net via another poor challenge from Yoro.",
      "Man Utd’s push for an equaliser came to no avail as Aston Villa defended strongly, with Rogers’ special brace securing their tenth win in a row that leaves them only three points adrift of the top of the table at Christmas.",
      "In the aftermath of this match, reckless media outlets will try to tell you that this loss has added fresh fuel to the ‘Amorim sack’ conversation, but on this occasion, this would be particularly unjustified.",
      "Actually, Amorim’s decisions contributed to Man Utd besting Aston Villa in every department aside from the scoreline, which warrants praise, not ridicule, given the immense form of the hosts and the sheer lack of options at the head coach’s disposal.",

Widespread expectation that tougher games would bring Sunderland back down with a bump have thus far proved wide of the mark; there won’t be many teams unhappy at taking four points from two games against Chelsea and Arsenal this season.

Four wins in five games have a distinctly winnable Europa League campaign bubbling along nicely, too. An astonishing shift from what felt like an inexorable downward spiral not that long ago.",

We reckon there is as they eye ‘two’ alternatives, and it’s always worth remembering that we’re talking Next Premier League Manager To Leave here, and that the traditional ‘Sack Race’ shorthand is a bit misleading.",

They would at that point find themselves slap bang in the muck of a relegation scrap; instead they have lifted themselves back into the mid-table morass where – luckily for them – absolutely nobody is any good at all and the chance of re-establishing themselves in there and even emerging out the top is very real indeed.",
      "There are multiple reasons for Newcastle making such a sticky start to the season and very few of them are directly the fault of a man who did deliver the club’s first trophy in bloody ages last season. That one seismic result against City had vast implications for the title race but was so big for Newcastle and their manager themselves, but derby defeat at Sunderland will inevitably sting.",
      "",
      "Won’t be sacked, obviously, because Palace are absolutely punching with an elite-level manager who is quietly delivering astonishing results in trying circumstances.",
      "But with reports he was willing and ready to walk out if Marc Guehi was sold without a replacement point to new strains on a relationship that is bound to be tested in the weeks and months ahead.",
      "Nailed it in the Community Shield, but as ever for clubs on Palace’s level there’s a positive-and-negative scale to be balanced by your manager catching the eye so conspicuously. Glasner absolutely could be poached with bigger beasts surely paying attention to the work he’s done at Selhurst Park.",
      "And if that poaching comes from outside the Premier League, then it comes with the possibility of making Glasner the next Premier League managerial casualty. But still very unlikely.",
      "We’d imagine the significant lowering of the threat level for a Ruben Amorim Sack at United eased some nerves at Selhurst Park, but the significant raising of the threat level for an Arne Slot Sack at Liverpool or even Thomas Frank Sack at Spurs has them looking a bit nervous once more. For more than one reason, it’s vital Palace don’t lose Glasner to someone as ropey as Spurs.",
      "",
      "Backed in to a hot favourite as the whispers began before the international break. But just when we thought it might be time to accept something is fundamentally broken here as a relegation fight bubbled up, an impressive win over Sunderland and a restorative visit to Dr Tottenham have sorted things out.",
      "Victory at Burnley has made it three wins from four, lifted Fulham away from the relegation battle and towards the mid-table strivers, and significantly lessened the real risk that he or Fulham might do something they live to regret.",
      "",
      "One of the key early-season imponderables for 25/26 was just how big and what kind of impact the Club World Cup might have on the way Chelsea and Man City start the season. Would they hit the ground running, or would they be a bit tired and out of sorts? For both, it’s been a little from column A, a little from column B.",
      "Maresca definitely still has some hearts and minds to win at Chelsea despite the fine finish to the season that saw them tick off Champions League qualification while completing their collection of UEFA pots and pans and then winning the actual Club World Cup.",
      "A home draw with Crystal Palace wasn’t ideal, but the paddling dished out to West Ham has what really should at least be some kind of halfway credible title bid up and running at least. And we strongly suspect Fulham won’t be the last team left scratching their head after losing to Maresca.",
      "There was some talk of ‘Maresca out’ after a draw with Brentford but that was surely only a minority view. After losing to Manchester United in shambolic fashion, there were more on the bandwagon.",
      "That win over Liverpool was big, though, and a particularly good one for Maresca himself. The second half thumping of Forest was handy, too, albeit inevitably saying far more of their opponents than it did of Chelsea. Home defeat to Sunderland saw awkward questions resurfacing, but three wins from three before going toe-to-toe against champions elect Arsenal despite playing most of the game down to 10 men appeared to have rubber-stamped Chelsea’s bona fides.",
      "And then they lost to Leeds United. Which was largely Maresca’s fault. And then continued their self-fulfilling 2024-redux tumble out of the title race with a draw against Bournemouth. Sigh.",
      "Then even a welcome victory has put Maresca under even more pressure after he decided to be very, very weird about everything immediately afterwards.",
      "",
      "Seven points from three games against Newcastle, Burnley and Bournemouth left things looking far comfier than might have been expected for a manager who, when the Magpies took an early lead at the London Stadium, looked to be heading for a second sack of the season long before the Christmas decorations went up.",
      "But quite why Nuno had to be so very Nuno in the way he, on the back of 3-1 and 3-2 wins and a 2-2 draw, decided to approach a home game against a Liverpool team that had just suffered three consecutive three-goal defeats, is puzzling, irritating and, above all, a reminder that he is here as a firefighter and that the marriage to a fanbase with limited patience for drab and functional let’s-not-get-relegated football is merely one of convenience.",
      "Especially as we still await truly compelling evidence that this football won’t, in fact, get them relegated. They are still in the bottom three and the increasing signs of life at Nottingham Forest and Leeds have to be a concern.",
      "Are there three worse teams than West Ham in the Premier League this season? It’s an extremely fair question.",
      "",
      "Impossible to avoid the conclusion that Slot’s reaction to Liverpool’s mini-crisis becoming actual-crisis was poor. He went Full Klopp with his salty loser behaviour when Manchester United committed the crime of altering their tactics to give themselves the best chance of success against Liverpool, and the headloss continued after another chaotic and unstructured performance led to a 3-2 defeat at Brentford.",
      "Having ticked ‘opposition doing tactics wrong’ off his rattled manager bingo card, he can now add ‘losing his mind over entirely uncontroversial refereeing decisions’ with his response to both the Cody Gakpo non-penalty and Virgil van Dijk penalty at the Gtech.",
      "It has to be a worry for Liverpool that Slot has for the first time in his Anfield career found himself under any kind of pressure after a chastening run of defeats, and has suffered severe and instant headloss as a result.",
      "Funny to think of a manager who’s just beaten Real Madrid in the Champions League being under threat, but defeat at the Etihad was miserable before Nottingham Forest came along and achieved the amusing feat of being the first team to shut Liverpool out in the Premier League at Anfield since Nottingham Forest.",
      "And then there was a new nadir against PSV. That really was very, very bad. West Ham were wonderfully welcoming hosts on Sunday, but to such an inexplicable extent that it’s hard to know just how much to read into Liverpool’s 2-0 win at the London Stadium against opponents who were barely there. Predictably, they were poor in a 1-1 against proper team Sunderland and showed no backbone in the collapse at Leeds United, which was then followed by a distinctly unwelcome MO SALAH BOMBSHELL that does leave things looking distinctly like either he or the manager will have to go.",
      "A run of three consecutive wins cools the immediate temperatures, but it does all feel extremely precarious.",
      "",
      "Time to stop trying to work out if Man United are good or rubbish. They’re just meh. Arguably that’s even worse, really, when This Is Manchester United Football Club We’re Talking About. But trying to look for clues in the tea-leaves of their results is completely futile when they do things like win three games in a row and then come unstuck at Nottingham Forest or fail even to win at Tottenham like literally everyone else even vaguely competent is able to do at the moment.",
      "Losing at home to 10-man Everton and then winning from a goal down at Crystal Palace just highlights the pointlessness of trying to read anything into what Manchester United are doing. It’s just a bunch of stuff that happens.",
      "What does that mean for Ruben Amorim? That he’s probably fine. They’re definitely less bad than they once were, and he wasn’t sacked then. So probably won’t be now.",
      "",
      "So doomed now they might as well stick with Edwards for a bit. He’s only just got here. And they really did play well at Arsenal, despite the late heartbreak.",
      "",
      "The hard-nosed yet valid argument persists that Leeds could and perhaps should have taken drastic action in the summer even after their very good week. It would have made Spurs’ decision to sack Europa League-winning Ange Postecoglou look positively kind, Leeds – and Burnley for that matter – might now be better off had they thanked the managers who secured 100 Championship points and got them back into the big time and then sent them on their way.",
      "Farke had a dreadful Premier League record of only six wins and 26 points from his 49 games in charge of Norwich, a team he twice led to promotion from the Championship with 94 and 97 points.",
      "As well as fighting his own record in this competition, Farke faced the added burden of expectation levels very different to those at just about any other club that could possibly find itself promoted into the Premier League in this current era where that represents the most bittersweet of successes.",
      "Defeat at Burnley was honking, but bouncing back to win another six-pointer against West Ham eased the stress significantly before a paddling at Brighton and events elsewhere – including West Ham themselves – left Farke desperately short of immediate cover before a desperately poor show in a six-pointer at Nottingham Forest.",
      "Another painful defeat having gone in front, against Villa this time, saw Leeds drop into the bottom three ahead of a brutal run of games, but that run has gone surprisingly well. The narrow loss to Man City preceded a rare home win against Chelsea and comeback draw against Liverpool.",
      "The question now is whether Leeds and Farke have really hit on something sustainable, or this is merely delaying the inevitable. After the 4-1 win against Crystal Palace, it really does start to look like it might be the latter which has enormous repercussions for both Farke and several other names around him on this list.",
      "",
      "Decision time for Burnley. There are two options available, and they prompt inevitable questions.",
      "Option one: Burnley decide to really try and beat relegation, and must decide whether they think Parker is the best man for that job.",
      "Option two: Burnley accept their overwhelmingly likely fate, and must decide whether Parker the best man to get them back up again.",
      "Parker’s job prospects likely rest on the decision. Because if it is indeed option two, he has a compelling case. Option one? He’s f*cked.",
      "",
      "There have been good days and bad, and our whole pondering of Frank’s situation at Spurs has been about determining which of the two would eventually win out. The harrowing NLD-PSG-Fulham week was the first time he really did look f*cked.",
      "Spurs were timid and abysmal in the North London Derby, the second big London derby in a row which Frank had approached more in the manner of a League One manager attempting to avoid a paddling in the FA Cup third round than a legitimate rival facing a familiar foe.",
      "There was some encouragement in a 5-3 Champions League defeat at PSG, but even the very fact it’s possible to write the words ‘some encouragement in a 5-3 Champions League defeat’ is in its own way damning.",
      "But at least those two defeats came against what genuinely might be the two best teams in Europe at this time. With all due respect to Fulham and the sterling work of Marco Silva in recent years, they are not one of the two best teams in Europe at this time, and they were still much better than Spurs who torpedoed themselves inside the opening seven minutes to extend their extraordinarily – and in fairness largely pre-Frank – awful home record in the Premier League to three wins in 21 games since an increasingly odd-looking 4-1 win over Aston Villa in November last year.",
      "Frank’s response to the booing of Guglielmo Vicario after his hideous blunder was firmly in the ‘That’s true, but he shouldn’t say it’ category. And the way he went about it was all wrong.",
      "There should have been some acknowledgement that the booing of Vicario, unsavoury and unhelpful as it may have been, did not burst forth from a clear blue sky but instead a bubbling frustration from fans who pay among the highest ticket prices in the country to watch what is now among the worst and least effective football in the country.",
      "To instead label those supporters – and the boos did not come from a tiny minority inside the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium – not real Spurs fans was another gaffe that pushes the manager further towards the exit.",
      "Until that point we’d felt the obvious comparisons between Thomas Frank and Nuno Espirito Santo didn’t quite fit.",
      "But it’s certainly starting to look uncomfortably similar in familiar ways; the small-time approach to big games has not been well received and the fear grows that he just doesn’t understand what this job requires. The fact almost no manager in Premier League history has managed to understand what this job requires is cold comfort at this time.",
      "However, from there Spurs went to Newcastle and got a draw (albeit a ludicrous one) before they had a dominant 2-0 win against Frank’s old club Brentford at the weekend, which everyone at Spurs sorely needed. It was easily their most convincing Premier League performance since the win at City on matchday two and a result that could have been even more convincing.",
      "They then pretty much secured a Champions League play-off round spot at the very least with a fine 3-0 win over Slavia Prague.",
      "But Spurs are Spurs, so they followed that with the worst performance yet of Frank’s reign in a truly inept and miserable 3-0 defeat at Nottingham Forest.",
      "Bringing Joao Palhinha and Ben Davies on to try and hold on to a 2-0 defeat and not even managing that feels uncomfortably like the infamous Nuno Moment against Manchester United.",
      "Have reached the kind of state where a dreadful home defeat to a very poor Liverpool is being dressed up as ‘signs of encouragement’. In reality, it might have been the worst possible result; still a defeat, yet one that risks extending the increasingly obviously doomed reign of the latest manager to be chewed up and spat out by the country’s most preposterous football club.",

      "Three teams have been picked for more Premier League TV games than Arsenal, Liverpool and Chelsea this season. Manchester United, obviously, but also…",
      "Premier League clubs received a total of £2.83billion last season, which was comprised of six payments through the division’s ‘central revenue system’, something the Premier League says ‘ensures the most equitable distribution of funds of any major European league’.",
      "Liverpool were paid £174.9m as champions – short of Manchester City’s record £176.2m in 2022/23 – while Newcastle received just over £160m to chuck into their PSR black hole.",
      "Southampton were handed £109.2m for their efforts in finishing a distant bottom. It pays to be in the Premier League.",
      "Some of those payments are fixed. All 20 clubs automatically receive around £96.9m through an equal share distributed based on both the domestic (£29.8m in 2024/25) and international (£59.2m in 2024/25) broadcast deals – those TV rights are lucrative for a reason – as well as £7.9m each from central commercial revenue streams.",
      "The rest is variable, based on where clubs finish and how often their games are selected for broadcast.",
      "",
      "The Premier League merit payments are distributed on a sliding scale from 1st to 20th, made up of combined earnings from domestic and international broadcast deals.",
      "For the 2024/25 season, the difference in prize money was around £2.7m per position. Southampton were given as much for finishing bottom, all the way up to champions Liverpool receiving £53.1m. It basically helped pay for 97.4% of Giorgi Mamardashvili and Jeremie Frimpong.",
      "That can be expected to fluctuate with inflation and other factors – it was around £2.8m per position in 2023/24 – but it offers a rough guide as to what clubs should expect to earn this season.",
      "",
      "1st (Arsenal) – £53.1m",
      "2nd (Manchester City) – £50.4m",
      "3rd (Aston Villa) – £47.7m",
      "4th (Chelsea) – £45m",
      "5th (Liverpool) – £42.4m",
      "6th (Sunderland) – £39.8m",
      "7th (Manchester United) – £37.1m",
      "8th (Crystal Palace) – £34.5m",
      "9th (Brighton) – £31.9m",
      "10th (Everton) – £29.1m",
      "11th (Newcastle) – £26.5m",
      "12th (Brentford) – £23.8m",
      "13th (Spurs) – £21.2m",
      "14th (Bournemouth) – £18.6m",
      "15th (Fulham) – £15.9m",
      "16th (Leeds) – £13.3m",
      "17th (Nottingham Forest) – £10.7m",
      "18th (West Ham) – £7.9m",
      "19th (Burnley) – £5.2m",
      "20th (Wolves) – £2.7m",
      "",
      "The only other part of the prize money which is not fixed and shared equally are the facility fees, which are based on how many times each club has been selected for television.",
      "In 2024/25, Liverpool had 30 games televised in the UK, for which they received £24.9m in facility fees. Arsenal had 29 matches and were paid £24.2m, while Manchester United (28 games for £23.4m), Aston Villa (27 games for £22.6m) and Chelsea (26 games for £21.8m) were televised frequently and rewarded handsomely.",
      "Ipswich were shown on the fewest occasions and received £8.9m in facility fees for their 10 live televised UK fixtures.",
      "This can lead to discrepancies in terms of those variable payments. Manchester United’s prize money after finishing 15th last season was £136.2m, more than the four clubs immediately above them – West Ham (£130.9m in 14th), Everton (£131.8m in 13th), Crystal Palace (£136.1m in 12th) and Fulham (£135.5m in 11th) – as Ruben Amorim’s side were picked for far more live TV games.",
      "Spurs were another massive outlier, earning more in 17th (£127.8m) than Wolves did in 16th (£123.1m) in part because they had nine more games picked for live UK broadcast.",

      "",
      "One big change in Premier League prize money going forward is that the 2025/26 season represents the start of a new four-year TV deal cycle.",
      "A new record £6.7bn domestic rights deal will see the number of live games rocket up to 267 of a possible 380, with every Premier League game outside the protected Saturday 3pm kick-offs to be broadcast live.",
      "Their packages include all Saturday 5.30pm, Sunday 2pm and Sunday 4.30pm kick-offs, plus Monday and Friday evening games and three midweek rounds.",
      "Overseas TV rights are worth more than £2bn per year to the Premier League with new deals signed with broadcasters in Japan and Mexico to go alongside lucrative packages in America, Scandinavia, Thailand, China, India and elsewhere.",
      "But the facility fee payments are tied to how many times a team is picked for broadcast by Sky and TNT, with both broadcasters having made their picks up to before Boxing Day. One game generally translates to roughly £0.83m but does fluctuate.",
      "Manchester City and Spurs were the biggest winners from the latest round of picks up to March 1 with four more games each.",
      "Burnley were only selected once more – on the February midweek when every team will be televised.",
      "1st) Manchester United (24 games televised live in the UK) – worth around £20.2m in 2024/25",
      "2nd) Aston Villa (23 games) – worth around £19.3m",
      "=3rd) Arsenal, Manchester City, Newcastle, Nottingham Forest and Spurs (22 games) – worth around £18.5m",

      "",
      "The Premier League generally tries to announce the rescheduling of games for live broadcast six weeks in advance but complications with domestic and European cup competitions can sometimes cause a delay.",
      "These are their approximate dates for when they aim to announce live TV games:",
      "Matches in March – by January 21\nMatches in April – by March 4",
      "Games in May are particularly susceptible to being changed at shorter notice as there is a need to see what gaps appear in clubs’ schedules, and frankly so broadcasters can manufacture more drama in races for the title, European qualification or survival.",
      "",
      "While it will vary due to inflation, fluctuating operating costs and other mitigating factors, it is possible to estimate how much total prize money each Premier League team will be paid in 2025/26 based on the payments made in 2024/25.",

      "Ryan Giggs feels there is a “massive plus” at Manchester United despite the club losing some of their key players to the African Cup of Nations in December.",
      "United played their last game with Amad Diallo and Bryan Mbeumo in the squad for a while, in the 4-4 draw with Bournemouth on Monday. Noussair Mazraoui was not even able to play that, with Morocco not allowing the Red Devils to pick him in the squad.",
      "The aforementioned trio have left for AFCON, with the earliest date they are likely to return the beginning of January, as the group stages end on the final day of December.",
      "Mbeumo has been one of United’s very best players this term, and the other absent players have also been of use.",
      "As such, the seventh-placed Premier League club will be somewhat worried about their fixtures without the trio, given there are a couple of tough tasks in their next two games: Aston Villa and Newcastle.",
      "United legend Giggs feels there’s cause for optimism despite losing three top players, though.",
      "“[Benjamin] Sesko is now back, which helps. But it’s definitely going to be a blow because Mbeumo has probably been the best player so far this season and looks like a real threat. Plays every game, has power, scores goals, and Amad can make things happen. So yeah, it’s going to be tough.",

      "Every summer, as soon as the last competitive ball is kicked, football turns into a glossy travelling circus. Clubs criss-cross the globe in search of broadcast exposure, commercial partnerships and, increasingly, the kind of international branding that even mega-corps like Amazon and Google might think was a bit much.",
      "The modern pre-season tour has become a pillar of elite football’s economy. Yet as the miles stretch further, the environmental cost grows heavier. The contradiction is now impossible to ignore: the sport’s most aggressively globalised tradition is also one of its biggest carbon headaches.",
      "The distances involved are staggering. Manchester United‘s 2023 tour, for example, included stops in Edinburgh, Oslo, New Jersey, San Diego, Houston and Las Vegas. According to publicly available flight data for comparable routes, such a journey easily exceeds 20,000 kilometres of air travel. Long-haul flights remain one of football’s most carbon-intensive activities, with aviation consistently identified by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change as a major emissions source.",
      "Find out where your team ranks in the Pledgeball table!",
      "United are hardly alone. Arsenal, Chelsea and Liverpool regularly venture to the United States. Spurs and Newcastle visited Australia barely minutes after the 2023-24 season finished, a single trip that – based on standard aviation emissions calculations for London-Melbourne return flights – produced several tonnes of CO₂ per person, before factoring in staff, equipment and internal travel.",
      "Clubs argue, often fairly, that these tours are commercial imperatives. The Premier League’s overseas broadcasting deals now dwarf domestic packages and international fan engagement translates directly into revenue. There is also a strategic logic: the United States and Southeast Asia are enormous growth markets. As long as sponsors and rights-holders prioritise global visibility, clubs will feel compelled to keep hopping across continents. Put simply, the machine pays too well to slow down.",
      "But the climate reality is moving faster than football’s commercial model. The United Nations Environment Programme has repeatedly highlighted the disproportionate emissions from international sport travel, while UEFA and FIFA’s own sustainability reports acknowledge travel as the single largest contributor to tournament footprints. The contradiction is baked into the structure of elite football. Clubs publicly commit to net-zero strategies, yet continue participating in a pre-season system designed to maximise miles, not minimise emissions.",
      "Some clubs are beginning to take tentative steps toward a different model. Brighton & Hove Albion have opted for more Europe-based pre-seasons in recent years, reducing long-haul flights while still accessing competitive opponents. Brentford have explored hybrid approaches, mixing local training camps with short-haul travel. FC Copenhagen, one of the more progressive clubs in Scandinavia, have publicly discussed avoiding unnecessary long-distance travel outside major competitions. These decisions are often framed as performance-oriented – shorter travel equals better recovery – but the environmental benefits are obvious.",
      "Did you know, 100,000 tonnes of sportswear ends up in landfill every year in the UK alone?",
      "A handful of clubs have experimented with centralised training hubs, a concept borrowed from American sports. Instead of flying from city to city for friendlies, teams gather in a single region or country, reducing the number of long-haul flights required. It is not a perfect solution, but it is measurably better than zig-zagging across continents. Another emerging idea is the “festival” model: several clubs gathering in one location for a mini-tournament, cutting down on both miles and logistical complexity. The Premier League Summer Series in the United States has even inadvertently demonstrated this, grouping fixtures within a relatively contained region to reduce internal travel.",
      "The conversation is also shifting at governing-body level. UEFA’s 2030 environmental strategy stresses travel reduction and more efficient scheduling, though it stops short of regulating club tours. FIFA have commissioned sustainability studies for the expanded Club World Cup, which itself required enormous global travel. For all the talk of responsibility, binding restrictions remain rare. Football seldom limits what boosts revenue.",
      "The science, however, is unequivocal. Aviation emissions are among the most damaging forms of climate impact and long-haul flights generate significantly more CO₂ per passenger-kilometre than most other forms of transport. While clubs often offset flights through tree-planting schemes or certified credits, many climate researchers argue that offsets cannot substitute genuine emissions reductions. The most effective solution remains the simplest: fly less.",
      "This is where football’s commercial priorities clash with its environmental aspirations. Clubs promote recycled kits, solar panels, electric mowers and waste-reduction drives – programmes that are valuable, genuine and necessary. But none of them match the scale of emissions produced by a two-week global tour involving tens of thousands of kilometres in the air. It is the sustainability equivalent of bragging about reusable water bottles while taking a private jet to work.",
      "Still, this issue is not unsolvable. Football has reinvented itself before, sometimes dramatically, when commercial logic demanded it. The same machinery that built pre-season tours into a global brand vehicle could just as easily retool them into a lower-carbon model – if governing bodies, sponsors and clubs decide the reputational upside is worth it. As climate expectations tighten across every sector, that moment may be coming sooner than football anticipates.",
      "Until then, the sport’s most glamorous summer ritual remains one of its dirtiest secrets. The crowds, the content and the commercial gains will continue, but the climate cost will grow heavier each year.",
      "In an era when football increasingly markets itself as a vehicle for social betterment, its love affair with long-haul summer travel remains the one area in which the industry most clearly refuses to look in the mirror.",
      "To learn more about Pledgeball and how you can pledge to help your club shoot up the sustainability standings, visit Pledgeball.org.",
      "The Mailbox insists Arsenal have become ‘terrible to watch, attritional and boring’ under Mikel Arteta this season despite being top of the Premier League.",
      "Three excellent centre-backs – well two very fine and one woefully out-of-form – are approaching free-agency, with Liverpool keen on at least two of them…",
      "There are three England linchpins in a top four headed by a Real Madrid star, while Arsenal, Man City and Man Utd all have talking to do…",

      "In the winter, there is typically an equal amount of noise, but not nearly as much action, with the window often descending into a snore-fest.",
      "This could easily be the case next month, but there are at least a few fascinating topics to be settled as Antoine Semenyo is among those at the heart of the conversation.",
      "If Erling Haaland was not performing at such an unbeatable level, Semenyo would be considered a serious contender for Player of the Season in the Premier League at this point in the campaign.",

      "This is bittersweet for Bournemouth as they have reaped the rewards of his stellar performances this term, but it also means that he will soon be playing his football elsewhere.",
      "This is especially the case because Semenyo has a reasonable £65m release clause in his current contract, which reportedly becomes active for a brief time in January.",
      "And the intense competition for his services is another reason why an exit next month already feels pretty inevitable, with several outlets naming Arsenal, Liverpool, Manchester City, Manchester United and Tottenham Hotspur as the clubs vying for his signature.",
      "For the reasons mentioned above, this level of interest in Semenyo is hardly surprising, and on current form, he would immediately go into the starting XI of these teams upon joining.",
      "But which of these five teams will win the race to acquire Semenyo next month? And possibly more importantly, what will the four rejected sides do instead?",
      "Well, starting with Semenyo, each of these clubs has been leading the race to sign him at some stage over the last month, but that is obviously not the reality.",
      "Instead, the truth is in what was initially reported about Semenyo before Arsenal, Man City, Man Utd and Spurs seemingly came charging in, with this perhaps a case of the player’s agent engineering a bidding war by feeding false updates to the media.",
      "You perceptive readers will notice that Liverpool are not mentioned in the previous line; this is because they remain, as they always have been, the likely winner to sign Semenyo.",
      "MUST-READ FEATURES ON F365…\n* Big Weekend: Tottenham v Liverpool, Aston Villa, Martin Odegaard, Enzo Maresca\n* Transfer power ranking: Guehi, Baleba, Anderson among non-Big Six stars most likely to leave in 2026\n* Five-year net spend table sees Man Utd top ahead of January transfer window",
      "This is not only because The Guardian’s Jamie Jackson has reported that the winger ‘favours’ Liverpool. A move to Anfield just makes the most sense.",
      "Liverpool sporting director Richard Hughes, formerly of Bournemouth, has a relationship with Semenyo and already helped the Premier League giants sign former teammate Milos Kerkez in the summer.",
      "The Reds are well-stocked up front with Hugo Ekitike and Alexander Isak, but they are nowhere near as strong in wide positions, and this situation has been made worse by Mohamed Salah and Cody Gakpo’s disappointing form.",
      "Semenyo certainly fits the Liverpool mould for what they want from wingers, and he is also capable of playing on either flank.",
      "This signing would be a significant boost for Liverpool, especially if Salah leaves, but the centre-back department remains a more pressing concern for Slot due to a lack of options and the declines suffered by Ibrahima Konate and Virgil van Dijk.",
      "Marc Guehi, as he was in the summer, is the most obvious fix to this problem, but Liverpool could suffer more disappointment regarding this transfer in the winter.",
      "After Liverpool messed around in the summer, the world is Guehi’s oyster, so he would be foolish to accept a move in January and give up a potentially massive signing-on fee at the end of the season. So they will likely have to settle for Semenyo as their only marquee signing in the winter, which is not to be sniffed at.",
      "As for the other clubs, there have been murmurs about Arsenal doing a bit of business to ease their injury issues, though this “problem” cannot be used as an excuse for potentially another failed Premier League title challenge.",
      "This is also the case because it seems like there will be no notable departees as Mikel Arteta slams the exit door shut, preventing Gabriel Jesus, Ethan Nwaneri, Myles Lewis-Skelly and co. from moving for more game time.",
      "So with Arsenal already having the most complete squad in the Premier League, they have no real need to enter the market in January and surely won’t unless their injury issues suddenly worsen.",
      "Man City, too, are unlikely to do anything regarding incomings, though they are probably second to Liverpool in the running for Semenyo.",
      "Semenyo would obviously be a great addition, but they already have Jeremy Doku in Semenyo’s natural position. His performances have ranged from good to exceptional this season, so they are covered.",
      "READ: Premier League mood rankings as Tottenham plummet and Villa soar",
      "But unlike City and Arsenal, Spurs are in a far weaker position with their options in the final third.",
      "Thomas Frank’s side are said to be pulling out all of the stops to sign Semenyo, but this will likely ultimately fail to sign the winger.",
      "Instead, as David Ornstein has mentioned, it is foreseeable that they return for Man City star Savinho as an alternative after targeting him in the summer, with the winger currently only a bit-part player at the Etihad.",
      "And finally, Manchester United’s supposed interest is not a shock as they lingered in the summer before signing Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha instead of spending £80m on Semenyo.",
      "Man Utd certainly could do with Semenyo as they are already too reliant on Mbeumo and Cunha, but Liverpool are ahead of their rivals in the pecking order for good reason.",
      "So with Semenyo likely heading elsewhere, Man Utd’s window should be more low-key, with potentially only one in and one out.",
      "This would be in the midfield department, with a loan for Kobbie Mainoo said to be dependent on Man Utd signing a replacement, who will be a Conor Gallagher or a Ruben Neves, before getting their chequebook out for Carlos Baleba, Elliot Anderson and/or Adam Wharton in the summer.",
      "Now, feel free to hibernate for the entire January transfer window, because you already know which transfers will and won’t happen involving five of the Big Six. You’re welcome…",

      "“It has to be thought out carefully and we have to make sure the recruitment is going to be better than what it was.”",
      "Despite this, Ferguson has been pleased with Man Utd’s summer transfer business.",
      "Interestingly, Ferguson did not mention Sesko as he has made a slow start to this campaign, but he thinks Lammens has “made a difference” for this new team this term.",
      "“I think the appointment of the goalkeeper [Senne Lammens] has made a difference,” Ferguson added.",
      "“He’s young at 23, he’s quick, a big lad, good feet and hands, and I think that helps. I think they have needed that player. United have always had inspirational players over the years. I think that has helped.",

      "Our football betting expert Jones Knows called EVERY match result correct on Saturday, going eight from eight with the accumulator paying 1,200/1 - can he stay perfect?",
      "This one is primed for chaos.",
      "Both teams rank inside the top four for xG created per 90 when trailing in a match. It's where Villa are actually thriving when it comes to the data.",
      "What this tells us is that if the scoreline changes early, the match won't settle. It'll stretch, open up, and turn into an end-to-end spectacle with two dangerous attacks.",
      "Villa have taken 15 points from losing positions this season, more than any other Premier League side. That's not luck. That's mentality, style and intent.",
      "When they fall behind, they double down on attacking patterns rather than protecting themselves. At Villa Park, that philosophy is heightened, too. Against a Manchester United side that have averaged 3.5 total goals per game this season and one that also thrives in broken, transitional games, that points towards this being a potential banger.",
      "Both teams to score and over 2.5 goals at 10/11 with Sky Bet is a winner in waiting.",
      "Marco Silva looked crestfallen watching Fulham being knocked out of the Carabao Cup in midweek.",
      "Another chance to challenge for a trophy came and went. And the harsh reality for Fulham is that Silva, who is out of contract in the summer, has probably outgrown them now. He's a very ambitious coach.",
      "Ask yourself this: would you rather keep Fulham in mid-table season after season or potentially go take a job where challenging for honours and playing in Europe is on the radar? Silva has earned a crack at that.",
      "And with uncertainty growing about his situation, that could spell trouble for Fulham over the next six months or so. A club that are famed for downing tools when safe in mid-table, that regression may come sooner.",
      "In contrast, there's a freshness and enthusiasm in the way Nottingham Forest are playing now under Sean Dyche. With Murillo and Nikola Milenkovic back as a pair, a surge up the table is expected. Forest draw no bet at 11/10 with Sky Bet is a tasty wager.",
      "Newcastle's injury crisis has had a huge influence on this market where Chelsea are now favourites at 29/20 with Sky Bet. It's a price which looks skinny to me but the team news angle still is a betting proposition as whoever fills in at right-back for Newcastle is going to be under serious pressure if Alejandro Garnacho starts.",
      "All signs suggest Lewis Miley is set to deputise on that side and at 5/1 with Sky Bet to be booked, that's a price that simply doesn't marry up with the task he's facing. When Garnacho is on song, he is the definition of a stress test for defenders.",
      "When at Manchester United, since the start of the 23/24 Premier League season, Garnacho drew a card every 206 minutes. That's elite territory for an attacker and it's not accidental data. He plays on the edge, he attacks defenders with pace and he's very theatrical under contact.",
      "Burnley going away from home still carry that old narrative of blunt, toothless and just happy to compete. But when you hone in on Bournemouth's defensive numbers of late, this trip to the south coast looks far more open than the prices suggest.",
      "Andoni Iraola's men have conceded 21 goals in their last nine games, and that isn't coming from freak results or red-card chaos. It's a structural issue, one that revolves around the centre-backs being far too exposed and unable to defend with the same one-to-one authority as Dean Huijsen and Illia Zabarnyi.",
      "Burnley to score over 1.5 goals is 100/30 with Sky Bet.",
      "I am going back to the well in taking on Brighton in this spot because the well is still overflowing with value. Brighton, for all their fluidity and lovely patterns, simply do not enjoy playing teams who go direct and turn them.",
      "Under Fabian Hurzeler, Brighton have won 19 of 36 Premier League games when their opponents have played under 15 per cent of passes long, but only three of 17 games otherwise. Sunderland are fifth in the long passes metric of all Premier League teams this season and are likely to undertake a style of play that causes Brighton issues.",
      "The away team are 6/5 with Sky Bet on the double chance.",
      "A bet that stands out here at the prices is Manchester City to win the cards race at 7/2 with Sky Bet, meaning we need City to be shown more cards than West Ham to land the pot.",
      "Despite the bulky price, this bet has landed in eight of City's last 13 games in all competitions, which points to them carrying a cynical edge to their game of late. This includes in a similar home game against Leeds where they won the card race 4-1 despite being the outsiders in the market.",
      "Across their last eight games, West Ham have seen the opponents average two cards per game with the threat of Jarrod Bowen and Crysensio Summerville triggering some card-worthy action from defenders.",
      "Wolves top the charts this season for fouls committed and Matt Doherty really got into the spirit of things on his return at Arsenal, making a whopping five fouls.",
      "He will be tasked with keeping Kevin Schade quiet - a player that leads the way for fouls drawn this season for Brentford at 1.62 per 90. This makes Doherty's price to make two or more fouls at 5/4 with Sky Bet very appealing.",
      "Of Arne Slot's last 17 wins away from home at Liverpool, 12 of those have seen under 3.5 goals too. That is a relevant trend when assessing the best way to back a pro-Liverpool angle in this fixture.",
      "We all know about Tottenham's issues in forward areas and them being able to create quality chances. All their key attacking metrics have the look of a team that should be battling relegation: 9.6 shots per game, 3.3 shots on target per game, 1.0 expected goals per 90 and 1.8 big chances created per game. It's an underlying attacking process which is the fourth-worst in the Premier League. Another blank may follow here.",
      "You can get 21/10 with Sky Bet on Liverpool to win and under 3.5 goals - a nice boost on the Evens for a Liverpool win.",
      "Our old friend of Arsenal to win and under 3.5 goals at 6/5 with Sky Bet is the line that appeals.",
      "Arsenal don't do goal-glut football. Quite the opposite, really. Across all competitions, their matches are averaging just 2.7 goals per 90 minutes, a surprisingly modest return for a team perceived as a free-flowing force. Mikel Arteta's men have seen 15 of their wins this season land the 3.5 goals too, including last weekend against Wolves where they delivered the odds in dramatic fashion.",
      "With Everton certainly missing Idrissa Gueye and Iliman Ndiaye and potentially without Keinan Dewsbury-Hall and Jack Grealish, David Moyes is going to have to go back to basics for a result. Defend deep, get the crowd involved and try to cause problems from set pieces. That's unlikely to be enough to work against this Arsenal machine.",
      "This is a fixture where the league table tells you very little, but the calendar tells you everything. At full throttle, with both teams fresh and raring to go, Palace have shown they are the better team.",
      "However, three games in six days, different opponents, different tactical demands and now a trip to Elland Road - one of the most physically demanding environments in English football - tips the scales firmly in Leeds' favour.",
      "Palace's schedule is unique and brutal. And what we've seen from Daniel Farke's team in recent weeks is that they make games an intense battle.",
      "This isn't a bet against Palace's quality. It's a bet against the schedule they're trapped in. Leeds at 8/5 with Sky Bet is best bet of the weekend material.",
      "1pt treble on: Leeds to win, both teams to score & over 2.5 goals in Aston Villa vs Man Utd & Nottingham Forest to win (13/1 with Sky Bet)",

      "Last week, when quizzed on not using academy graduate Kobbie Mainoo, Amorim used Harry Amass and Chido Obi as examples, suggesting they were not at the level required for United at the moment.",
      "Both players then posted pictures on their Instagram accounts, which were subsequently deleted, seemingly in response to Amorim's comments. Amass posted a picture of him with a player-of-the-month award at Sheffield Wednesday, while Chido's image was of him celebrating scoring for the U21 side.",
      "When asked about Amass and Obi, Amorim defended his \"strong words\", suggesting the young players at the club feel \"entitled\" and the culture needs to change.",
      "Man Utd boss Ruben Amorim after being quizzed on his use of academy graduate Kobbie Mainoo:\n\n\n\"I don't know what is going to be the future [for Mainoo]. Let's see after this match.\n\n\n\"Amass is now struggling in the Championship. Chido (Obi) is not always a starter in the U21s.\n\n\n\"All these guys played when a lot of people were saying sack the manager!'",
      "\"Sometimes strong words are not bad words, sometimes difficult moments is not a bad thing for kids. We don't need to always be accolades in everything, every situation.",
      "\"You guys talk about players who speak against clubs because they feel entitlement, then you have legends say if you don't play, leave because everyone is wrong. No, let's stay and fight, let's overcome and maybe the manager is wrong. I have the feeling we need to fight against this feeling.\"",
      "\"I'm the first one to say I'm failing inside the pitch,\" he added. \"I have that feeling. We are not performing the way we should be but outside the pitch I guarantee I'm not failing this club.",
      "\"We talk about the players sometimes forget what it means to play for Man Utd, we as a club forget sometimes who we are. That's the feeling that I have.",
      "\"It's the environment, the kids feel entitled and free to respond to the manager with a picture. My office is open but nobody is coming to me. That's the way we can solve things.",
      "\"We need to change as a club.",
      "\"I didn't say anything wrong, I spoke about how the luck of playing for Man Utd. Sometimes you play for Man Utd and see different realities and you understand football can be so different and you are really lucky to be at Man Utd. That was my point, but let's move on.\"",
      "Meanwhile, Amorim says there is no problem with Mainoo after his half-brother's T-shirt stunt and hopes the Manchester United midfielder fights for his future at the club.",
      "The homegrown 20-year-old talent has gone from FA Cup hero and starting the Euro 2024 final for England to a bench player over the last 18 months.",
      "Mainoo saw a request to leave on loan rejected in August and is still waiting for his first Premier League start of the campaign, leading to speculation he could depart United in the January transfer window.",
      "The midfielder came off the bench in Monday's 4-4 draw with Bournemouth at Old Trafford, where his half-brother Jordan Mainoo-Hames wore a 'Free Kobbie Mainoo' top and later posted about it on social media.",
      "Asked if he has spoken to Mainoo about the incident, Amorim laughed and then said: \"No, it was not Kobbie that wore the T-shirt.",
      "\"He is not going to start because of the T-shirt, but he is not going to the bench because of the T-shirt. He is going to play if we feel that he is the right guy to play. That is not an issue.",
      "\"I am used to [it]. I am here for a year. It's not new, so we have to deal with that, but I am not going to do something to Kobbie because someone in his family is doing something.\"",
      "It felt like a message to the changing room.",
      "When asked about the situations around Bruno Fernandes and Kobbie Mainoo this week - Amorim repeatedly spoke about how his office is always open for players to talk to him.",
      "When asked about two young players - Amass and Obi - who both posted messages on social media last week which seemed in defiance of Amorim discussing their lack of first-team involvement this season (both posts were then deleted) - he talked about the feeling of entitlement among the younger players at the squad.",
      "He repeated that word, 'entitlement'.",
      "It is hard to disagree with the United manager. Obi made seven appearances last season while Amass made five for the first team.",

      "Bruno Fernandes believes he can still win trophies with Manchester United, despite a difficult period for the club; on the Rio Ferdinand Presents podcast, the captain also discussed his leadership and how Man Utd has changed since he arrived in January 2020",
      "Thursday 18 December 2025 18:04, UK",
      "Bruno Fernandes has discussed his loyalty to Manchester United, saying he believes the club can return to former glories and win multiple trophies.",
      "The Man Utd captain appeared on the Rio Ferdinand Presents podcast, which was recorded before his explosive interview with Portuguese TV channel Canal 11 was published, and also revealed he stayed at the club despite two offers to leave.",
      "Fernandes told Canal 11 he was \"hurt\" that the club were open to offloading him to Saudi Arabia during the summer.",
      "But speaking to Ferdinand, the midfielder says the club can win regular silverware, and he would not have stayed as long as he has if he did not believe it was possible.",
      "Fernandes said: \"Loyalty in football before was like [Francesco] Totti at Rome, [Ryan] Giggs at United, [Paolo] Maldini at Milan, so when I came to the club, apart from loving being here and loving the club, I think my loyalty was in the toughest periods and I could have left two times.",
      "\"The club said 'no, we need you' and I said 'OK, you gave me something, I will give you something'. The time at the club has not been as I wanted because I wanted to lift trophies and I haven't lifted as many as I should and could.",
      "\"But at the same time, I think everything I've done for the club was still very important and I'm not taking anything away from other players that were here. When we struggled the most, I stayed present to the club and I hope everyone at the club is aware of that because the chances I had were very good.",
      "\"I'm very aware that I could have gone a different path and probably won more trophies and people talking about me in a different way because I've had trophies into my cabinet. Nowadays people talk more like you are a better player or a worse player if you win or you lose trophies.",
      "\"When I speak about going and winning trophies, I stayed here because I think I still can win trophies here. I wouldn't have stayed here if the club hasn't told me our aim is still to be the highest we can be, get back to winning trophies, get back to be the club we were before.",
      "\"If that was not the aim then yes, I wouldn't have stayed here, but because I know the aim of the club is still to get back to where they want to be and where I want the club to be, that's why I came to the club in the first place. If I can help to get back there, that's all I want to do.\"",
      "Fernandes is often the focal point of any Man Utd performance, whether that is having a hand in the goals or his passionate on-field reactions.",
      "That has often been the case since his arrival at Old Trafford in January 2020, with Fernandes also offering an insight into how his team-mates help him maintain the club's standards.",
      "He said: \"As a captain, obviously you're going to get more attention, stick and everything. But that comes with the club also - it's not just by the armband.",
      "\"I haven't changed the way I was for the way I'm now because I've got the armband. When Erik [Ten Hag] chose me to be the captain, he knew what type of captain I was. I know I lead by example, because I do everything is needed to do on the training pitch. I train as hard as I can.",
      "\"I can moan as much as people think, but I run more than I moan - I'm pretty sure of that. So I think I'm still an example of the way things have to be done for the club. The standard.",
      "\"Then I think I treat everyone as I would like to be treated and when I talk about everyone, I don't see anyone below me. For me, everyone's in the same level. It could be me, it could be the people that serve us at the restaurant, the chefs, the nutritionists, the staff.",
      "\"No one is below and no one is above me. Obviously, apart from the bosses, the manager and the other ones that are above the managers, but still, the managers, they say 'guys, I'm in the same level as you, I just have more responsibility and I have to take the decisions. That's where I'm above you'.",
      "\"And as a captain, I have sometimes to make decisions on things. But we have a leadership group that is me, Harry [Maguire], Licha [Lisandro Martinez], Tom [Heaton], [Noussair] Mazroui and Diogo [Dalot].",
      "\"We then add players in the situation that are not in the leadership group, like Casemiro and Luke Shaw, because we also want players with big responsibilities to have a say.",
      "\"From that six [of the leadership group], the message has to be clear for everyone else. We have to become a little bit of a bigger personality than the other ones, because we need to make the rules clear for everyone.",
      "\"But that's not just me, it's the leadership group that has to put a stamp in place, like, 'guys, this is what we're going to do and mandatory for us. This is the way, the path and what we have to have to play at this club'.\"",
      "There has been plenty of change at Man Utd in the almost six years since Fernandes joined. He has played under six managers - Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, Ten Hag and currently, Ruben Amorim, on a permanent basis, with interim spells for Ralf Rangnick, Michael Carrick and Ruud van Nistelrooy.",
      "There has been silverware, including the FA Cup and Carabao Cup, as well as success - and a lack thereof - in Europe.",
      "On what has changed since he first walked into the dressing room in 2020, Fernandes said: \"There were a lot of experienced players. You had David [De Gea], Nema [Nemanja Matic], Juan [Mata].",
      "\"Paul [Pogba] was already a big player. Jesse [Lingard] was a big player at the time already, you had Rashy [Marcus Rashford]. Then we'd come with a mix of youngest.",
      "\"I think everything has changed in the world of football in the last, not just five years, but also the years I've been in football. Nowadays, the young ones put the music [on] in the dressing room.",
      "\"But I really like the mix we have in the dressing room [now] because it makes me feel very young, the energy they have, the way we involve everyone together, and not looking at age difference, who's been here longer, who's been here less.",
      "\"We don't have that thing of who's more important, who's less important... The energy is very good.\"",

      "Sunday 21 December 2025 15:40, UK",
      "He may be in his third season at Old Trafford, but it finally seems that Manchester United fans are starting to see the best of Mason Mount.",
      "Question marks were raised when Erik ten Hag paid £55 million for the then-maligned Chelsea star, especially given his fitness concerns and lack of obvious role in the Dutchman's system.",
      "After early struggles, he seems to have found his feet under Ruben Amorim. Earmarked as an early favourite of the Portuguese, he currently finds himself on his most consistent run in the team at the Theatre of Dreams, already equalling his previous best seasonal goals tally at the club.",
      "For many, Mount has become a focal point in how Amorim wants his United side to play. They clearly get better results when he is in the team - the Red Devils have lost just once in the Premier League when he starts, compared to three times when he doesn't. But the numbers show that doesn't necessarily equate to better performances.",
      "Amorim has often insisted that it doesn't matter in what formation his teams line up in. What matters is the finer details as to how the players operate within it.",
      "\"The most important thing is to create the principles, the identity and the character that we had in the past. We need time, but we have to win time. To win time is to win games. But the most important thing is identity,\" were his exact words when he was first hired in November 2024.",
      "While he hasn't spoken out on the specifics of what those principles are, history shows that Amorim's teams focus on a possession-based style built around shorter passes and a high defensive line that enables an assertive pressing approach.",
      "On the surface, that sounds like a way of playing that would suit Mount's strengths. Yet when he is in the team, those characteristics seem to falter.",
      "It has been a 50/50 between games started and games where the Englishman has either come off the bench or not featured. When he starts, United not only pick up more points, but they score more goals (2.25 per game vs 1.50) and are far more efficient when finishing their 'big' chances (1.38 goals vs 0.75).",
      "That points towards a positive impact, which can't be denied. Look further though, and you see that with Mount in the team, United tend to move further away from the fundamentals associated with Amorim.",
      "Though the number of chances created when Mount starts is significantly higher, the number of 'big chances' is lower, suggesting that United have far more low xG efforts built up in these games, rather than creating clearer goalscoring opportunities more frequently.",
      "Some of this lack of higher-quality chances can perhaps be attributed to the fact that there is also a major shift towards a more direct style of play when Mount starts compared to when he doesn't.",
      "With him in the team, United average more long passes. They also attempt 10 per cent fewer passes in the final third and pull off 17 per cent less.",
      "Perhaps most surprisingly, in games where Mount starts, United win possession back in their attacking third less too. Given that the narrative is that Mount's energy aids United in the press, you'd expect the opposite to be the case.",
      "That is not to say that Mount is the sole reason for the drop-offs.",
      "As an individual, he ranks sixth in the team in chances created, fourth in final third passes attempted and completed, only ninth in long passes and second in possession won in the attacking third among the squad.",
      "By those metrics, you can see that he is doing what you would expect him to do based on Amorim's requirements. Yet, as a collective, United are moving away from Amorim's principles more often when Mount is in the team.",
      "Is that a criticism? If anything, it's the opposite. Much has been said of Amorim's reluctance to adapt his way of playing in order to find success, but the data proves that there is flexibility to be played with.",
      "It is more interesting though that a player who was believed to be the epitome of what Amorim needed from his squad has highlighted that his success is coming when he steers away from the methodology that he was so steadfast in bringing to Old Trafford.",
