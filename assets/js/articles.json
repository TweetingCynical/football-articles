      "Tottenham are on course to have a deal wrapped up for Brentford's Thomas Frank. The Danish coach is set to be the man to succeed Europa League-winning boss Ange Postcoglou in north London but the changes aren't likely to stop there.",
      "Frank is a coach rather than a manger and will be tasked with improving the squad at his disposal. But after the Lilywhites finished in 17th position, the 51-year-old will rarely have a stronger position to negotiate from over what he requires in the transfer market.",
      "There will be key decisions to make over a number of players with the future of captain Son Heung-min a hot topic. But Tottenham technical director Johan Lange will be the figure heading up much of the recruitment, possibly alongside a returning Fabio Paratici.",
      "With a return to Champions League football to manage in addition to the battles of the Premier League, the pressure will be on Frank to deliver on both fronts. And perhaps a new player or two can help boost Spurs' numbers and quality ahead of a better season.",
      "Guglielmo Vicario is set to remain the club's No.1 with the likes of January signing Antonin Kinsky to provide back-up. Goalkeepers Fraser Forster, 37, and Alfie Whiteman, 26, are both set to be released at the expiry of their contracts.",
      "The Spurs backline will see Kevin Danso make his loan move permanent this summer after arriving amidst the club's injury nightmare midway through the season. Already there is some competition with talented stars such as Micky van de Ven, Cristian Romero and Radu Dragusin at Frank's disposal.",
      "With Dragusin still recovering from an ACL injury and Romero being linked to a possible exit for Atletico Madrid, perhaps there is room for another however. Spurs have already been linked to Everton's Jarrad Branthwaite, AS Roma defender Evan Ndicka and Crystal Palace's Marc Guehi.",
      "If Spurs can take advantage of Guehi entering the final year of his contract with the Eagles, perhaps he his most likely to slip into a backline including Pedro Porro, Van de Ven and Destiny Udogie.",
      "In midfield Frank will have talented youngsters to choose from in Lucas Bergvall and Pape Matar Sarr, while only one of older options Yves Bissouma and Rodrigo Bentancur is likely to extend their stay via a new contract. The latter could help provide a base alongside Sarr if Spurs plan to stick with the players they have.",
      "Adam Wharton and Eberechi Eze have both drawn interest from Tottenham but could prove difficult to prise away from Selhurst Park ahead of Oliver Glasner's side heading into Europe and being notoriously tough negotiators. With James Maddison already in the squad, Frank has an option to play in an advanced role and Dejan Kulusevski could also thrive in such a position.",
      "Across Spurs' frontline a familiar face could arrive in the form of Bryan Mbeumo to provide plenty of goalscoring threat from the right side. Frank is said to have asked for the Cameroon international to follow him from Brentford.",
      "On the opposite flank could be Son Heung-min but after securing his place as a Spurs legend by virtue of finally winning a trophy, he could find new competition. Bournemouth star Antoine Semenyo is of interest to Tottenham and would appear to fit in with Frank's philosophies.",
      "Up front, Dominic Solanke is the obvious option to lead the frontline. Son could provide some support in that position throughout the season, in addition to Richarlison but Solanke will be handed the responsibility.",
      "Dream Tottenham XI: Vicario; Porro, Guehi, Van de Ven, Udogie; Bentancur, Sarr; Mbeumo, Kulusevski, Semenyo; Solanke.",

      "Alejandro Garnacho is heading towards the exit at Manchester United having failed to live up to the demands set by Erik ten Hag. United have slapped a £70million asking price on Garnacho in the hope he can help fund their summer rebuild, but even if he does leave for a big fee, the winger will do so having fallen short of Ten Hag’s expectations.",
      "Thankfully for United, there are interested parties, with Napoli, Chelsea, Aston Villa, Atletico Madrid and Bayer Leverkusen all monitoring his situation. The 20-year-old returned 11 goals and 10 assists in 58 games last season and his value is helped by the fact he is under contract until June 2028.",
      "It is that contract, worth £50,000-a-week and signed in May 2023, which prompted a challenge from Garnacho’s former manager, Ten Hag. While congratulating him on his deserved deal, the Dutchman - who is now reportedly among the managers that want to sign him - warned that it would lead to increased expectation.",
      "“First of all, I think he has the prize and it’s a prize,” he said. “He also shows he can make the final step – not only in talent but also, he made it. But now it’s a new start, a restart, because now the expectations will be higher, the demands definitely will be higher.",
      "“He is on his way, he is a strong character and that’s why he’s there in the moment on this level, and he did it by himself. But now is coming more work to go because the demands are higher, we expect more from him. But it’s great he made it because it tells we will give young players opportunities, but they have to deserve it.",
      "“When I say ‘give’, translate it to ‘deserve’ and they have to deserve with their feet, they have to show it on the pitch and that means you have to invest a lot and deserve it by training performances, by performance in the under-21s, then wait for your moment and prove it again.",
      "“For Alejandro, he is that step beyond but now the demands will be even more because he has now to compete for a starting XI position. So, every time is the same: you have to cross limits and every time you have to go in the next level. We go with him in that challenge but most important is the player has to do it.”",

      "Gyokeres scored more than 50 goals last term and has been tipped to reunite with Amorim in Manchester after the Portuguese boss swapped Lisbon for Old Trafford midway through the campaign.",

      "Haaland has been hugely impressive and successful during his three years in England. He's just missed out on the Premier League title for the first time but has broken numerous records since swapping Borussia Dortmund for Manchester City.",

      "Stuart Dallas has said that Manchester United have been \"really, really poor\" this season, as the Red Devils lick their wounds from a devastating 2024/25 campaign. New boss Ruben Amorim was unable to turn the tide at Old Trafford after taking over from Erik ten Hag in November, guiding the club to a record-low 15th-place finish in the Premier League standings.",
      "While the Red Devils looked to save an otherwise catastrophic campaign via better performances in Europe, a 1-0 loss to a similarly struggling Tottenham Hotspur in last month's Europa League final only served as further embarrassment for the once-titans of English football.",
      "\"The two clubs together are so far down the league. Spurs have obviously been decimated with injuries. It's been really, really difficult for them.",
      "\"Their style of play, on their day when it clicks, they're a really, really good team. You can see what their DNA is, but Man Utd, on the other hand, I'm still yet to be convinced of what their actual DNA is. I don't see any change from a couple of things, but in general it's been really, really poor for them.\"",
      "Dallas also pondered whether a Europa League title was enough to argue that Spurs have had a successful season, given that the Lilywhites finished two places lower than United in the Premier League standings. He added: \"It's mad to think that they were both European finalists as well and Spurs have obviously come out on top.",
      "\"I don't know, is it a successful season for Tottenham? They've won the European Cup and they've got Champions League football. It's bragging rights over Arsenal.",
      "\"Arsenal have obviously had a fantastic season. They've come second, but they haven't won a Cup and they're in the Champions League. Spurs have won a Cup and are in the Champions League.\"",
      "Spurs are currently on the hunt for a new manager in the wake of parting ways with Ange Postecoglou earlier this month, with Brentford boss Thomas Frank looking increasingly likely to take tenure at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium for 2025/26. Manchester United, meanwhile, are currently undergoing major revamps to their current squad with hopes that a summer transfer window and a full pre-season campaign can be a game-changer for Amorim.",
      "The Red Devils have already struck a £62.5million deal for Wolves forward Matheus Cunha in the first of two windows, as they continue to look to sign Brentford's Bryan Mbeumo. United reportedly saw their initial £55m bid for Mebeumo rejected, but reports suggest that the club are still keen on landing the talent this summer.",
      "Elsewhere, the club are also currently linked with the likes of Sporting CP star Viktor Gyokeres and Barcelona shot stopper Marc-Andre ter Stegen. On the flip side, the club recently announced that Christian Eriksen, Jonny Evans and Victor Lindelof are among the stars on their way out the doors of Old Trafford as their contracts expire.",

      "A crossroads stands before Manchester United in their hunt to sign Brentford talisman Bryan Mbeumo this summer. And with transfer funds not exactly flowing at Old Trafford right now, it could prove definitive for their other investments in the coming months.",
      "United's opening offer of £55million for the player was reportedly turned down by Brentford. And though another bid is believed to be imminent, Ruben Amorim's side would do well to take stock of their options before launching a follow-up.",
      "Despite finishing at an all-time low of 15th in the Premier League and failing to qualify for Europe next term, United at least have some cards in their hand. That's after The Athletic reported Mbeumo, who was keen to join a Champions League club, now has his heart set on a move to Old Trafford despite interest from the likes of Arsenal and Newcastle.",
      "That U-turn, after both those clubs were linked with Mbeumo in January, tilts the transfer battle in United's favour. Tottenham have also been mooted as a suitor amid talks that Thomas Frank is set to take over in north London, though murmurs suggest Mbeumo values the United cause above Spurs' upcoming European adventure.",
      "It's a similar sequence of events that saw Amorim land Wolves talisman Matheus Cunha in such swift fashion. The Brazil international was keen to play for United above all else next term, underlining United still have serious pulling power despite their absence from European competition next season.",
      "It's believed the Bees are seeking upwards of £60m to part ways with their player, an almighty fee considering United already shelled out £62.5m for Cunha. But if the Red Devils want their man they may just have to suck it up.",
      "Man United's second option is to finance the deal by parting ways with Alejandro Garnacho, which many might deem an inevitability already this summer.",
      "Argentinian newspaper Ole has suggested AC Milan have opened talks to sign Garnacho and are seeking a deal worth £50m. That's £15m short of United's supposed valuation of the player, though it may be enough to convince them, considering Amorim's difficult relationship with the 20-year-old.",
      "That sum also wouldn't quite cover the outlay required to recruit Mbeumo, who would come at a higher cost to the wage bill. However, it's a convenient route to offloading one troublesome asset while signing what would effectively be his replacement.",
      "Except Mbeumo plays almost exclusively on the right wing, while the majority of Garnacho's minutes are spent more centrally and on the left flank. It also poses the question as to what lies in store for Cunha and whether he's intended to start up front, behind the striker or out wide.",
      "Amad Diallo has just started coming into his own under Amorim, and he too operates almost solely off the right. After several years of overcoming injuries, managerial changes and loan spells away from Old Trafford, it would be a shame to see the 22-year-old's progress halted now.",
      "Yet United are in dire need of results now and can ill afford to bid their time on the hope of what may come down the line. In that sense, Mbeumo would be a proven Premier League upgrade based on what's been seen of the player in recent seasons.",
      "The Cameroon international finished this season with 20 goals and eight assists and appeared in each of Brentford's 38 league games. But he wouldn't be the first big investment to impress elsewhere before falling flat under the increased pressure at United.",
      "The Red Devils will be expected to fork out a heavy sum regardless of how Mbeumo arrives at the club. But the manner in which they balance the books could play a major role in how far the club can afford to invest elsewhere this summer."

      "Garnacho offers a prime chance for United to bring in a profitable fee and to provide a boost to the team's outlook under profit and sustainability rules as a result of coming through the club's academy after signing from Atletico Madrid as a 16-year-old. The winger has been told to find a new club by boss Ruben Amorim.",

      "Arsenal, Chelsea and even Saudi Pro League side Al-Hilal have been linked, but it's a move to Old Trafford that looks likeliest as things stand, especially with the Gunners also focusing on Benjamin Sesko and Chelsea pushing for Hugo Ekitike, having already signed Liam Delap at Stamford Bridge.",
      "Gyokeres' frustration with Sporting has boiled over, with reports indicating the striker is 'furious' over a broken promise. He has an £84m release clause in his contract, though it's understood a gentlemen's agreement was made which would allow Gyokeres to leave this summer if an offer of around £60m was tabled.",
      "However, according to Portuguese outlet Record, Sporting are now reluctance to honour this deal, leaving Gyokeres feeling betrayed. The club, having signed him for £20m from Coventry City in 2023, now stand to make a significant profit, and are now demanding at least £67m.",
      "This, naturally, has sparked tension, with eagle-eyed fans noticing that Gyokeres has now removed all reference to Sporting from his Instagram bio. Though it must be said, he's also taken down mention of Sweden's national team and his sponsor, Nike.",
      "Sporting's revised asking price may shed light on why Arsenal – previously considered favourites to sign the Swede – have cooled their interest.",
      "Gyokeres is expected to demand a weekly salary exceeding £250,000. And when combined with substantial agent fees, any potential deal becomes a costly proposition.",
      "The additional £7m Sporting have tacked onto the transfer fee has only made the move more prohibitive, and may have sewn distrust among potential buyers. However, the ongoing tension between player and club could accelerate negotiations, giving United and others a chance to capitalise on the situation.",
      "In a bold move, Gyokeres has turned down a staggering £30m-a-year offer from Saudi club Al-Hilal, underscoring his ambition to compete at the highest level. The lucrative proposal, which would have made him one of the world's best-paid players, was rejected, with Gyokeres prioritising a move to one of Europe's top leagues instead.",
      "Al-Hilal, eager to sign a marquee striker, targeted Gyokeres after their high-profile pursuit of Victor Osimhen collapsed last week. Osimhen, like Gyokeres, is linked with multiple Premier League clubs and reportedly rejected a lucrative £650,000-per-week offer from the PIF-backed outfit.",
      "Their rejections signal a focus on sporting ambition over financial reward. That said, securing either player will still require substantial investment, and United must be ready to meet significant financial demands if they want to land a superstar forward this summer.",
      "United's pursuit of Gyokeres could have been finalised by now had the club qualified for the Champions League. Earlier this year, Amorim identified Gyokeres as his top attacking target and laid significant groundwork for the transfer.",
      "It's said the Swedish striker would have quickly agreed to join the Red Devils had they defeated Tottenham in the Europa League final to secure a Champions League spot. However, United's loss in Bilbao changed things. Fabrizio Romano reckoned a \"99% chance\", but as they prioritised Matheus Cunha, it has certainly never been that clear cut.",
      "Gyokeres is now weighing up his options. While he remains open to a move to Old Trafford, interest from overseas clubs like PSG, Juventus, and Barcelona could see him lured elsewhere.",
      "United are in frequent contact with Sporting and Gyokeres' representatives to negotiate a deal, but without Champions League football, their proposal could be less compelling than those of other clubs.",
      "Gyokeres' future remains a tantalising puzzle as the transfer window's first deadline approaches on Monday evening. United's hopes of luring him to Manchester will be buoyed by Amorim's close relationship with the player and the club's ambitious attacking overhaul, highlighted by the recent capture of Matheus Cunha and potential arrival of Brentford forward Bryan Mbeumo.",
      "However, a late twist remains possible. Arsenal could re-enter the race if their pursuit of Sesko falters and he takes the Al-Hilal cash, while whispers of interest from other Champions League clubs both domestic and overseas add uncertainty to United's chase.",
      "Gyokeres' next move will not only shape his career but could define the ambitions of whichever club secures his signature. For now, United hold the edge, but in football, nothing is certain until the ink dries."

      "Ex-West Ham star Ravel Morrison has discussed the huge telling-off he received from Hammers' vice-chairman Karren Brady. Morrison joined the Irons in 2012 for a three-year stint which was mostly spent out on loan.",
      "Under Sam Allardyce, the midfielder showcased glimpses of his raw talent that had led many to label him as one of the country's most naturally gifted footballers. Now 32, Morrison's career has been a mix of brilliant individual moments and off-pitch mayhem.",
      "Talking on the Undr The Cosh podcast, the former Derby County player recounted how he found himself in hot water with Brady for driving to training without a full UK licence.",
      "\"So, obviously, I drove to training on a provisional license, and Karren Brady went mad. She went mad. I didn't do that again,\" Morrison said. \"Someone must have told her. Like, I had to apologise, pick up the keys, get someone to pick me up from the car.\"",
      "When quizzed if he’d bought said car before getting a proper licence, Morrison said: \"A provisional license. I didn't live that far from the training ground, so I thought I could just [drive to training] quick... but I didn't get away with it with Karren.\"",
      "Morrison revealed the reason he hadn't taken his test is that he struggles to navigate the theory section, claiming he wasn't \"the brightest\". However, he said he does have a Jamaican and Mexican licence - but not an English one.",
      "The one-time Manchester United prodigy often found himself in the limelight just as much for his extraordinary goals as well as controversial incidents off the field. Yet speaking to The Athletic in June, Morrison argued that the root cause of his issues was often simple errors such as oversleeping and missing training, challenging the more damaging rumours tied to his reputation.",
      "\"I just couldn't wake up sometimes,\" he said. \"They were easy mistakes to make - stupid mistakes, yeah - but it's not like I was out drinking in town every weekend and having fights. It was only once in a blue moon when I would be late.",
      "\"What I've found is that if you get a reputation early on, it can stick with you through life. Or it does with me, anyway.\"",
      "Morrison has struggled to settle in a career that has taken him to 15 different clubs since 2010. As well as spells in the UK with the likes of Birmingham City, Queens Park Rangers and Cardiff City, Morrison has been all over the world.",
      "He has played in Italy with Lazio, Mexico with Atlas, and also had stints with Swedish club Ostersund, Dutch outfit ADO Den Haag and MLS side DC United. However, he does have regrets.",
      "\"If I could go back in time I would change 90% of my life,\" Morrison said on Rio Ferdinand's Vibe with Five podcast in 2021. \"But you have to look forward, you can't think about the past too much.\"",
      "Morrison departed the Hammers in 2015 after making 24 appearances and scoring five goals, but has fondly recalled his stint in east London as an \"enjoyable\" one. \"If I had the opportunity I'd have stayed with West Ham all the way through,\" he said in February 2021."

      "Manchester City are set to complete the signing of a second former Manchester United target for a combined £70million. Pep Guardiola has already welcomed Wolves defender Rayan Ait-Nouri into the fray, and Lyon's Rayan Cherki now looks likely to follow suit.",
      "Both stars have been on United's radar in the past. After a bitterly disappointing campaign that ended with a 15th-placed Premier League finish and Europa League final heartbreak, this summer transfer window is a pivotal one for Ruben Amorim.",
      "Matheus Cunha has already been poached from top-flight Wolves for £62.5million, having mustered 15 league goals this season. Yet another of Vitor Pereira's stars, Algerian full-back Ait-Nouri, has chosen the sky blue side of Manchester.",
      "He was a United target in the past, and he may not be the only star who once caught the Red Devils' eye to head to the Etihad this window. Reports suggest French technician Cherki could be on his way to Guardiola's side, and personal terms have already been agreed upon.",
      "Before he made his move from Angers to Wolves in 2020, the prodigious Ait-Nouri was reportedly of interest to then-Red Devils boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer. Contact was supposedly made between the Manchester club and Ait-Nouri's super-agent Jorge Mendes, with whom he parted ways last month, and the teenager even flew to England to tour various training grounds, including those of United and their rivals City.",
      "In the end, neither of the two could secure the services of a young Ait-Nouri, who joined Wolves on an initial loan deal and signed permanently in 2021 for roughly £15m. At Molineux, the 24-year-old developed into a marauding wing-back and has now been snapped up by the Cityzens in a five-year deal worth £36m, with United missing out on their former target.",
      "One year before interest in Ait-Nouri was reported, Solskjaer also had his attention on another phenom, Lyon's Cherki, who was only 15 at the time. The Telegraph alleged that the Norwegian head coach had set his sights on the teenager.",
      "The Frenchman was regarded as one of Europe's premier attacking talents at his age group. That's why the likes of Real Madrid, Barcelona and Bayern Munich were all battling to sign him.",
      "But Cherki ended up staying put. Having built up a reputation for having a rather problematic attitude, as highlighted by former coaches Fabio Grosso and Rudi Garcia, he has remained at the Groupama Stadium ever since.",
      "Having the attacking midfielder registered before the Club World Cup has become a priority for City, while United look primed to see yet another player slip through their fingers and potentially come back to haunt them next season.",

      "Ruben Amorim's squad will be given a significant makeover in the summer transfer window.",
      "Manchester United announced the signing of Matheus Cunha on the opening day of the window and they are hoping Bryan Mbeumo will be the second fresh face through the door.",
      "United triggered to £62.5million release clause in Cunha's contract at Wolves, which will be paid over three instalments, and a similar fee will be needed to persuade Brentford to allow Mbeumo to leave.",
      "Ruben Amorim does not have a warchest to play with, but Cunha and Mbuemo would take the summer spending to more than £120m and player sales will be important to offset incomings.",
      "It's no secret that United need to sell players this summer and, conveniently, there are three players who have decent resale value at the front of the queue to exit Old Trafford.",
      "The first of those is Marcus Rashford, who will be available for £40m. Rashford missed the end of the season at Aston Villa with a hamstring injury, but he showed enough during his temporary stint at Villa Park for a club to take a chance on him - Barcelona have been heavily linked - this summer.",
      "Rashford's sale will be considered as pure profit in the books. His departure will be key for the transfer budget, although shifting Antony and Jadon Sancho is also high on the agenda.",
      "Sancho will not be joining Chelsea on a permanent transfer, which means the Blues will now pay a £5m penalty charge to United to break the agreement they signed last summer.",
      "It's unprecedented for a club to pay £5m to break their obligation agreement and the ordeal is embarrassing for Sancho, whose career has sadly nosedived over the last few years.",
      "It also means a new buyer must come to the table for Sancho. There have been murmurs of interest from Turkey and United will hope they can bank £20m minimum for the winger.",
      "Antony could be remembered as the worst Premier League signing ever, but he was tremendous during his Real Betis loan and the Spanish club would like to sign him permanently.",
      "The Brazilian must be sold for £32.5m to avoid a PSR loss on his transfer from Ajax, but that would make him Real Betis' record transfer and they probably don't have that capital to spend.",
      "Again, that means United need to find a new willing buyer for Antony this summer, but his stock has improved due to his hugely successful loan stint and £32.5m feels like a fair valuation.",
      "The fourth sale up Amorim's sleeve is Alejandro Garnacho, who was informed he could find a new club this summer after a private breakdown with United's coach at the end of the campaign.",
      "Napoli and Chelsea were interested in signing Garnacho in the January transfer window. The fee of £40m was talked up, but United should be holding out for at least £50m for Garnacho.",
      "Garnacho has proven himself in the Premier League, he is an Argentine international and has not reached his ceiling. He is worth £50m because of the untapped potential he possesses.",
      "Amorim was asked if Garnacho had played his final game for the club after the win over Aston Villa and said: \"Garnacho is one more player of Manchester United, so I don't know what is going to happen in the future. He is a normal player.\"",
      "United's head coach added: \"Garnacho is a Manchester United player who was not in the squad today, but he is a normal player in our club and I have no news that will change [that].\"",
      "Amorim has handled Garnacho intelligently in public to protect his transfer value, giving him minutes on the post-season tour, but the 20-year-old is expected to have played his final game for the club. The combined sales of that quartet would total 142.5m."

      "Previously, the striker mentioned that he represented both clubs, but now it merely states that he is a 'Sportsperson'.",
      "Gyokeres last posted on the social media platform last week when he thanked his friends, family and followers for their birthday wishes. This post was immediately hijacked by United fans asking him to join their club this summer.",
      "The 25-year-old had a successful time at Dortmund before making the move to United in 2021. Sancho also returned to Dortmund on loan last year where he got to the Champions League final.",

      "Meanwhile, Director Giovanni Manna said: \"He feels good in Paris, we're at the European champion club, so we have no complaints. We are working on a renewal. I have never ruled out interest from the top Italian clubs, but there has never been a negotiation, let's see.",
      "\"He is still young, I have to squeeze him for at least another 10 years. At the moment, however, it is very difficult to see Donnarumma in the Italian championship, I'm not just talking about numbers but also about the sporting project. In Italy, beyond Inter who reached the Champions League final, there are Milan and Juve who are struggling, they are in the process of reorganizing: these factors are fundamental.\""

      "The window, after opening earlier than usual because of the Club World Cup, temporarily closed at 7pm on Tuesday evening, meaning there will be a brief pause in proceedings.",
      "However, the it will reopen again as soon as Monday (June 16), meaning clubs will once again be free to press ahead with their recruitment plans ahead of the 2025/26 campaign. The window will not close until September 1.",
      "United saw an opening offer of £55million for Mbeumo knocked back last week. They offered £45m up front and a further £10m in add-ons.",
      "Despite falling short of Brentford's valuation, United have remained in talks with the Londoners and are expected to make an improved offer for the Cameroon international, who scored 20 Premier League goals in the most recent campaign. The Reds would like to get a deal for Mbeumo over the line before the start of pre-season training in July.",
      "If United get a deal over the line for the 25-year-old, he will join Matheus Cunha in strengthening their attacking options. He recently arrived from Wolves after United trigged his £62.5m release clause.",
      "As well as wanting to sign Mbeumo, United also have ambitions of signing a striker, a midfielder and potentially a goalkeeper. The addition of a specialist right wing-back is also yet to have been ruled out.",
      "However, further additions will rest on generating funds via player sales.",
      "As far as outgoings are concerned, United are yet to oversee a sale this summer. The club is keen to cut its cloth this and they have a list of players they want to offload permanently, including Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho, Alejandro Garnacho and Antony.",
      "Striker Rasmus Hojlund is also attracting interest from Inter Milan and it remains to be seen if the Italian outfit will submit a formal offer for the 22-year-old.",
      "However, United, on Monday, confirmed nine players will be released when their contracts officially expire on June 30.",
      "It had already been announced that Jonny Evans, Victor Lindelof and Christian Eriksen will depart when their deals expire, but United's retained list confirmed youngsters Hubert Graczyk, Tom Wooster, Tom Myles, Sam Murray, Jack Kingdon and James Nolan will also leave the club at the end of this month.",
      "Discussions remain ongoing with goalkeeper Tom Heaton, who is also out-of-contract at the end of the month, over a new deal."

      "Anybody who watched Viktor Gyokeres regularly in his final season at Coventry City would have known about his potential.",
      "After scoring a very respectable 17 Championship goals in 2021/22, the Sweden international increased his output the following season, helping Coventry get within one game of promotion to the Premier League.",
      "He scored 22 goals and registered 12 assists in 50 appearances across all competitions for the Sky Blues in 2022/23, meaning their play-off final defeat to Luton Town meant it was inevitable he would have to be sold.",
      "Despite a plethora of Premier League clubs being linked with his signature, it was Sporting Lisbon that secured his services in a surprise move. He signed a five-year contract in a deal that was worth just north of £20million.",
      "Again, anyone who watched Gyokeres in 2022/23 knew he had the potential to be a steal at such a price. He was the best striker outside of the Premier League in England that season, with his variety of goals, running power, strength, ball striking ability and clever in-box movement clear for all to see.",
      "However, nobody could have prepared themselves for what he has done at Sporting over the last two seasons. His tally of 54 goals in 2024/25 means he has scored 97 goals in just 102 games.",
      "For all the talk about him playing in the Portuguese top flight, or his first touch sometimes being a little bit heavy, Gyokeres should be accepted for what he is: a goalscorer. And what is it Manchester United need this summer? A goalscorer.",
      "Football is a game of opinions, meaning it is understandable why some United fans are hoping the club will sign Gyokeres and others are in favour of Victor Osimhen.",
      "Both have established themselves as elite-level goalscorers and neither player would be a bad signing for United.",
      "Osimhen's wage demands could be a big stumbling block for United. He has reportedly set huge demands this summer amid the likelihood of an exit from Napoli and that could force the Reds to look elsewhere.",
      "If that is the case, they would not find a better alternative than Gyokeres, who is currently one of the most sought-after strikers in the world after another stellar season in Portugal.",
      "One of his biggest strengths is his ability to score all different types of goals. He is always alert inside the box, anticipating where the ball might drop.",
      "United lack a striker with excellent movement inside the 18-yard box, with Rasmus Hojlund often criticised for his poor positional awareness inside the penalty area.",
      "Gyokeres, who is well-versed in Amorim's 3-4-2-1 system, is equally capable of scoring from distance. He is also excellent at collecting the ball in deep areas of the pitch and using his power and pace to get his team up the pitch. His strength and running power would bring more athleticism to United's attack.",
      "Some may worry about him having no Premier League experience, and it is an understandable reservation after the club took gambles on Rasmus Hojlund and Joshua Zirkzee.",
      "However, Gyokeres has something those two do not have, and that is a proven goalscoring record. When it comes to signing a striker this summer, United have to sign one with exactly that.",
      "Gyokeres' numbers are absolutely outstanding and United should be throwing everything they realistically can at Sporting to try and get him.",
      "Where he was once a wildcard option, he should now be United's top target."

      "The thirst for transfer news is intense during the summer transfer window.",
      "Fans are desperate for minute-by-minute updates and Manchester United supporters want to know the latest on Bryan Mbeumo, who is keen on a move to Old Trafford this summer.",
      "Last week, United submitted an opening offer of £45million with a further £10million in add-ons, but it fell short of Brentford’s valuation.",
      "Some fans have become restless because they wanted an update before the first summer transfer window deadline, which is 7pm on Tuesday due to the Club World Cup.",
      "The summer window will close briefly before reopening again on June 16 and confirmation of a breakthrough for Mbeumo could arrive when it reopens. No progress is expected by close of play on Tuesday, despite a handful of 'in-the-know' accounts on X prematurely speculating that a second bid for Mbeumo had been made.",
      "The window is closing for six days to help the clubs that are competing in the Club World Cup, and talks will continue between the two clubs in that period.",
      "The player has indicated he prefers a move to Manchester and it's now down to United to negotiate a transfer fee with Brentford. The London club are in a relatively healthy financial position and have the option of another year in Mbeumo's contract, so they have bargaining power in discussions.",
      "Mbeumo will not be cheap, but there is a willingness on his behalf to leave and Brentford will not stand in his way should a fair transfer package be submitted by United.",
      "Tottenham closing in on the appointment of Thomas Frank could potentially complicate matters, as Frank has overseen Mbeumo's rise in England and the pair have a strong relationship.",
      "Spurs' decision to sack Ange Postecoglou and move for Frank has unsettled United fans, but there is no reason to panic at this stage because the player has given encouragement that he wants to sign for Ruben Amorim.",
      "It is also possible that Brentford could negotiate a clause in Frank's exit to ensure he cannot sign any of his former players for an agreed-upon period, to avoid some of Brentford's best players following him out of the exit door.",
      "Either way, United will be confident that they are in pole position to sign Mbeumo.",
      "United, Arsenal, Tottenham and Newcastle have been linked with the Cameroon international this summer, so the player indicating that he prefers a transfer to United was a significant development.",
      "How long it takes for another significant development with Mbeumo remains to be seen.",
      "United want a deal wrapped up as soon as possible so the forward can report for the beginning of pre-season, and they would like to complete the transfer before the end of the Premier League financial year with Profit and Sustainability Rules (PSR) in mind.",
      "There is hope that Mbeumo will be a United player before the end of the month, and United will be delighted with their start to the transfer window if they can get a deal across the line by then.",
      "Matheus Cunha and Mbeumo scored 35 goals between them in the Premier League last season, while United scored just 44 goals as a team, so they would strengthen a weak attack.",
      "United have made a strong start to the window, but there is still plenty of work to do."

      "The centre-back returned to Old Trafford for a second spell in September 2023 after spending time training with United during the summer. He signed a one-year deal before being offered another one-year contract at the end of the 2023/24 season.",
      "Turning 38 next January, it was widely anticipated Evans would use his departure from M16 as a chance to announce his retirement. However, he is yet to make a decision on what he will do next.",
      "\"I'm not sure yet,\" Evans told BBC Sport NI when asked about what the future looks like. \"I'll take a bit of time. I don't feel like I'm in a rush to do anything.\"",
      "The centre-back, who has won 12 major honours throughout his United career, made 43 appearances during his second spell at Old Trafford, which was a much higher tally than he probably anticipated when he returned to the club almost two years ago.",
      "United were reasonably well-stocked at centre-back and former United manager Erik ten Hag decided to bring the former Leicester City and West Bromwich Albion man back to Old Trafford to provide cover. He made 30 appearances during the 2023/24 season.",
      "Game time was much more limited in 2024/25, highlighted by his tally of just 13 appearances.",
      "However, injuries were a big contributor to that figure, with his cameo appearance against Aston Villa on the final day of the Premier League season his first outing in the league since Ruben Amorim's first game in charge of United against Ipswich Town back in November."

      "United will play three games in the US, facing West Ham United, Everton and Bournemouth as part of the Premier League Summer Series. After returning to home soil, they will wrap up their pre-season schedule with a clash against Fiorentina at Old Trafford.",
      "This will mark the third summer in a row that United have jetted off to the US for their pre-season tour. On the previous two, with the exception of just one game, United have been starved of an out-and-out centre-forward.",
      "Rasmus Hojlund arrived from Atalanta in August 2023 after United had returned from the US and he got injured in the opening game of last summer's pre-season tour, meaning he has not had a full pre-season since arriving at Old Trafford.",
      "He will desperately be hoping it is third time lucky for him this summer, although Inter Milan's interest in his signature could see him shipped out of Old Trafford before United board their flight to the US in the fourth week of July.",
      "With United prepared to sell any player this summer, they are unlikely to stand in the 22-year-old's way if an enticing offer is presented to them. He scored just ten goals in 2024/25 and patience with him is wearing increasingly thin.",
      "Whether Hojlund departs or not, it is no secret by now that United are desperate to sign a striker. However, after missing out on Liam Delap, it remains to be seen which direction that search will head in.",
      "They continue to be linked with the likes of Sporting Lisbon's Viktor Gyokeres and Victor Osimhen of Napoli, with both seemingly destined to move this summer, but no formal offers for a striker have yet been tabled by the Reds, with their focus currently on trying to sign Bryan Mbeumo from Brentford.",
      "United have already strengthened their attack by signing Matheus Cunha from Wolves for £62.5million, and Mbeumo is likely to command a similar fee, but ending the summer without recruiting an out-and-out No.9 can't be an option.",
      "The transfer window will temporarily close at 7pm this evening (Tuesday), but will reopen again as soon as next Monday.",
      "Once the window reopens, United need to try and step up their efforts in the seller's market. They want exits to reach double figures this summer and they have a crop of players within their ranks they want to sell who could bring in useful fees.",
      "United have identified Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho and Antony as priority sales, while Alejandro Garnacho has been informed he can leave. Selling any player is an easier-said-than-done task, of course, but if United were to successfully offload the aforementioned quartet, they would be looking to bank over £100m.",
      "That would give them a huge boost in their quest to sign a striker. Gyokeres is set to cost north of £60m and he is currently looking as though he could be the most likely candidate to strengthen Ruben Amorim's front line.",
      "Whether it be Gyokeres or an alternative centre-forward, it would be ideal if United could get a deal wrapped up in time to take their new chief goalscorer on the pre-season tour. That adaptation period can be so crucial for players ahead of the competitive action kicking off in August.",
      "Getting a new striker in ahead of the season starting would give Amorim the opportunity to see how he bonds and forms on-field relationships with his new teammates. United were playing catch-up in 2023 and Joshua Zirkzee did not go on last summer's pre-season tour after being granted a period of leave following his participation at Euro 2024 with the Netherlands.",
      "With the Club World Cup taking place over the coming weeks, the summer break is bound to feel as though it is going that little bit quicker. It means the clock is ticking for United to secure their most important jigsaw piece."

      "Although no new arrivals are expected before Tuesday's deadline, that is not to say United's decision makers are going to spend the next few days with their feet up waiting for the window to reopen. In fact, they will be doing quite the opposite.",
      "United offered £45m up front and an additional £10m in add-ons. It is thought Brentford are holding out for a similar fee to the one United paid for Cunha, meaning it could take a fee in the region of £60m to reach an agreement.",
      "But if United are successful in their pursuit of the Cameroonian and successfully lure him to Old Trafford, the expectation is he will occupy the right-sided No.10 berth. Cunha is expected to operate from the left-sided No.10 role.",
      "The prospect of Mbeumo and Cunha occupying the two spots reserved for the playmakers means both Bruno Fernandes and Amad are set to be deployed elsewhere. Fortunately, they are both versatile enough to play in the centre of midfield and at right wing-back respectively.",
      "United need to add goals to a blunt attack and Cunha and Mbeumo would do just that after scoring 35 goals between them in the Premier League in 2024/25. For context, United scored just 44.",
      "As fantastic and as exciting as it would be for United to add Mbeumo to the signing of Cunha, they are still without the No.9 they so desperately crave. United have been linked with plenty of strikers in recent months, but the one name that has not gone away at any point is that of Viktor Gyokeres.",
      "United's key to signing any elite-level striker this summer is via player sales. The prospect of them signing Mbeumo for around £60m before sanctioning any sales will almost certainly wipe out their entire budget.",
      "However, failing to sign a striker is a non-negotiable this summer. They are crying out for a reliable goalscorer and they simply have to buy one.",
      "In Gyokeres, United would be signing an established goal-getter whose numbers are just as eye-catching as Erling Haaland's have been in recent seasons. For all the talk about doing it in the Portuguese top flight, which, with respect, is not considered to be as demanding or as challenging as the Premier League, you can only judge a striker on his goals - and Gyokeres has scored a lot of them in the last two years.",
      "The prospect of United signing him and Mbeumo to join forces with Cunha in attack is exciting. Truthfully, it was fanciful only a few weeks ago.",
      "However, both Cunha and Mbeumo have expressed an eagerness to move to Old Trafford, highlighting the fact United still have plenty of pulling power.",
      "The midfield needs strengthening and there is a debate about whether Andre Onana should continue as the club's first-choice goalkeeper. However, right now, strengthening the attack is a far bigger priority. Three attacking signings could make the world of difference.",
      "United's dream XI: Onana; Yoro, De Ligt, Heaven; Amad, Ugarte, Fernandes, Dorgu; Mbeumo, Cunha; Gyokeres."

      "Hackney is reported to be valued at around £20million by Boro, but United will apparently face competition from Tottenham Hotspur, Nottingham Forest, Aston Villa and West Ham for the midfielder's signature.",
      "MEN Sport says: Hackney is widely regarded as one of the most talented players in the Championship, and almost helped Boro reach the play-offs last term. At 22 years old, Hackney has the years ahead of him to get even better which means United could get an impressive value-for-money signing if they manage to get a deal over the line."

      "Manchester United will have to wait a few days before being able to resume their transfer business for the summer.",
      "The first phase of the summer window is now closed, meaning United are not officially able to get deals over the line. The transfer window was open from June 1-10 thanks to the FIFA Club World Cup this summer.",
      "United have already got one deal over the line with Matheus Cunha arriving in a £62.5million move from Wolves. The Brazilian is not the only player to be linked with a move to United, though, but that will have to wait for later in the summer.",
      "The transfer window will open again on June 16 and will remain so until it closes on September 1 until the New Year. For the time being, United have an opportunity to take stock and weigh up what deals they want to complete when the window reopens once again.",
      "It won't just be new signings that United will be focused on this summer, but also players who could leave the club.",
      "United will want to raise funds via player sales in order to reinvest in the squad ahead of next season. Marcus Rashford, Antony and Jadon Sancho all spent time away from Old Trafford on loan last season and could all leave on permanent deals this summer.",
      "Rasmus Hojlund could also leave United this summer amid reported interest from Serie A outfit and Champions League finalists Inter Milan.",
      "United are interested in signing Brentford star Bryan Mbeumo, but will have to wait until the second transfer window to be able to get a deal over the line.",
      "An opening bid worth up to £55millioj from United was rejected by the Bees earlier this month, but the interest in Mbeumo is still there. The Cameroon international has also been heavily linked with Tottenham Hotspur in recent days.",
      "If United can agree a deal with Brentford for Mbeumo to complete a move to Old Trafford later this month, that would certainly kickstart the second transfer window in ideal fashion.",
      "United have been heavily linked with signing a striker for months, and Viktor Gyokeres is one player who has been mentioned regularly at the top of the list.",
      "Gyokeres has a €100million (£84million) release clause in his contract at Sporting Lisbon but is reportedly available for around £60million this summer. The striker has been linked with several of Europe's biggest clubs this summer, many of which have Champions League football as a key selling point going into next season.",
      "United will be aware that convincing Gyokeres to join the club this summer without any European football to offer may be a difficult task. But if the Old Trafford hierarchy can somehow agree a deal, it would certainly be a major boost going into next season.",
      "The goalkeeping department was a regular talking point at United last season. Andre Onana is the first-choice shot-stopper at Old Trafford and has Altay Bayindir as his understudy, but both players have been linked with moves away over the last few months.",
      "It remains to be seen which two goalkeepers United will have going into next season. Tom Heaton could leave the club this summer when his contract expires, although United have confirmed that talks are ongoing over a new deal.",
      "Only Amorim and those within the Old Trafford hierarchy will know what the plans will be for the goalkeeper position going into next season. Only time will tell if United want to sign a new goalkeeper or if they will continue with their current three options for another year."

      "When Manchester United swooped for Rasmus Hojlund from Atalanta in August 2023, it goes without saying that they paid over the odds.",
      "In his first and only season at the Italian club, the Dane scored ten goals in 34 appearances across all competitions. It was a respectable return, but it was by no means eye-catching.",
      "However, United made the decision to pay £64million for his signature. The package could still rise to £72m.",
      "United, who had been interested in Harry Kane earlier in the window, were in desperate need of a striker and their search eventually led them to Hojlund. However, they bought potential rather than a finished product.",
      "He arrived at Old Trafford as an incredibly raw 20-year-old who suddenly had the weight of the world on his shoulders. He had been brought in to strengthen an attack that had been too reliant on Marcus Rashford in the 2022/23 campaign.",
      "In truth, the jump from being a starting striker at Atalanta to being a starting striker at United was just too big for the Dane at such a young age. With the exception of the injury-prone Anthony Martial, Hojlund did not have anyone he could lean on for guidance or support.",
      "Despite that, he plundered a respectable 16 goals in his maiden season in England, and there was hope he would build on that tally in 2024/25. However, his performances regressed and he scored just ten goals, of which only four were netted in the Premier League.",
      "It further highlighted the feeling that Hojlund should have been signed to perform the role of United's secondary striker. Martial's injury record meant the Denmark international immediately had to step up and shoulder United's goalscoring burden.",
      "\"He is not good enough. He is lacking in confidence and belief and he is not surrounded by brilliance either.",
      "\"If people think they can fix that in one summer, it is not going to happen.\"",
      "Since making that admission after United were beaten 1-0 by Chelsea at Stamford Bridge almost four weeks ago, United have learnt of interest from Inter Milan in Hojlund's signature. United are prepared to sell any player this summer and the striker is one of the more likely candidates to be moved on to raise funds for new additions.",
      "Whether Hojlund stays or goes, United desperately want to recruit a new No.9 this summer. Despite originally targeting Liam Delap, there is a need for them to recruit someone who is an established goalscorer and ready to hit the ground running.",
      "Much of the current speculation centres around Viktor Gyokeres of Sporting Lisbon and Napoli striker Victor Osimhen. Both are proven goalscorers who have hit brilliant numbers in recent seasons.",
      "It is a striker of that ilk that United need to be signing this summer, as opposed to another striker in the bracket of Hojlund, who was recruited based on potential.",
      "Keane was right that Hojlund should have been signed to provide competition and not be the frontman of United's attack. This summer it feels almost inevitable that United will go down the right route when trying to bring in a No.9."

      "However, one of the biggest advantages of United being out of Europe next season is that Amorim will not have as congested a fixture schedule to deal with, meaning there will be a lot of free midweeks to spend on the training ground.",
      "As encouraging as that could be as a collective, some individuals may find game time much harder to come by. United need to reduce the size of their squad and a whole host of departures are expected.",
      "However, the bulk of the exits United are planning for are in the attacking department, with Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho and Antony being identified as priority sales. Alejandro Garnacho has also been told he can leave for the right price.",
      "The prospect of each member of that aforementioned quartet being sold will generate funds for United to reinvest elsewhere in the squad. They plan to sign Bryan Mbeumo, a striker, a midfielder and a goalkeeper.",
      "One area which is not expected to be strengthened, though, is the centre-back department. After signing Matthijs de Ligt and Leny Yoro last summer and then Ayden Heaven in February, United are very well stocked at the back.",
      "Despite the impending exits of out-of-contract duo Jonny Evans and Victor Lindelof, United still have five first-team centre-backs they can all upon in the shape of Harry Maguire, Lisandro Martinez, De Ligt, Yoro and Heaven. Noussair Mazraoui and Luke Shaw are also equally comfortable operating in the back-three.",
      "Injury issues meant United didn't finish the 2024/25 campaign with a settled defence, meaning pre-season is set to determine who will make up Amorim's first-choice back-three come the start of the new campaign in August.",
      "Amorim could find himself with four players believing they are worthy of occupying the left-sided centre-back spot. Martinez, both before and after United switched to a back-three, was the club's main left-sided centre-back.",
      "However, his season-ending ACL injury meant the position was occupied by several different faces in the second half of the season, including Yoro, Heaven and Shaw.",
      "Despite originally being signed to operate as the right-sided centre-back in a back-four, United's mid-season shift to a back-three was expected to see Yoro become Amorim's first-choice option on the right of his three-man defence. However, the Frenchman arguably produced his best performances for United so far on the opposite side of the defence.",
      "\"[Being] right footed is more easy for me sometimes on the right, but I really like to play on the left,\" Yoro said earlier this year. \"When I go inside, I can put a long ball to the striker, or in the middle, so I like both sides. It's no problem for me.\"",
      "Yoro has the capacity to become a staple in United's defence for many years to come, likewise Heaven, who has not put a foot wrong since arriving from Arsenal earlier this year.",
      "Martinez will be hungry to reclaim the left-sided centre-back spot and make up for lost time once he recovers from his injury. He was just getting to grips with the demands of Amorim's 3-4-2-1 system prior to his injury and will be keen to demonstrate his ball-playing credentials.",
      "If he can stay fit, Shaw will also be keen to muscle in on the conversation for a starting berth. Now that United operate with wing-backs, his main route into the team is at centre-back.",
      "With no obvious winner, pre-season could decide who wins the race to become Amorim's first-choice left-sided centre-back."

What's more, they would not need to convince Sancho about the merits of moving to Dortmund - it is well known he is a big fan of the club.",

      "With that in mind, MEN Sport has taken a look at the latest surrounding Gyokeres.",

Record state that Sporting initially wanted €60m (£50m) up front, with €10m (£8.5m) in add-ons, but now they've moved the goalposts.",

      "According to Portuguese newspaper A Bola, Gyokeres has made it clear he intends to leave Estadio Jose Alvalade this summer. He reportedly believes that, after his contributions over the past couple of years, his departure would not harm Sporting.",
      "Despite receiving 'better proposals' last summer, the Swede chose to remain in Lisbon. Now, at 27, he is said to feel that the time is right to take the next step in his career.",
      "As a result, Gyokeres has taken 'Sporting' out of his Instagram profile. Previously, he had all references to Sporting and Sweden on his Instagram bio.",
      "But now it merely states that he is a 'Sportsperson'.",
      "A special and historic welcome gift could be enough to tempt Gyokeres to M16. One potential bonus the club may offer is the historic number nine shirt.",
      "It has been worn by a number of club icons including Sir Bobby Charlton, Andy Cole, Dimitar Berbatov and more. The No.9 shirt is currently being used by Rasmus Hojlund - who has endured a torrid time since he arrived from Atalanta in a deal worth up to £72million and has himself been linked with a move away from the club this summer, which would leave the number free for Gyokeres' potential arrival.",
      "According to FootMercato, Gyokeres is a 'priority target' for Saudi Arabian side Al-Hilal. The report says that the striker is 'actively followed' by the club.",
      "Their interest comes after Victor Osimhen turned down a move to the Middle East. It was reported over the weekend that Al-Hilal has scheduled a medical after a £63m deal was agreed, but the player rejected the move despite a lucrative deal being on the table.",
      "The Saudi Pro League outfit have now been left looking for an alternative option and Gyokeres has emerged as a target. They are reported to be eager to back new manager Simone Inzaghi in the summer transfer window following his move from Inter Milan."

      "Man Utd legend Paul Scholes urged the Red Devils to sign Crystal Palace star Eberechi Eze during England’s 3-1 defeat to Senegal on Tuesday night.",
      "Eze played the full 90 minutes against Senegal as Thomas Tuchel suffered his first defeat as England manager as the Three Lions were booed off following an underwhelming performance.",
      "Crystal Palace winger Eze had only been brought off the bench in the second half of their 1-0 win over Andorra in England’s World Cup qualifier on Saturday – but Tuchel trusted him to make an impact from the start against Senegal.",
      "Man Utd are looking to add attacking talent to their ranks this summer with a deal for Matheus Cunha already sealed in a £62.5m deal from Wolves.",
      "The Red Devils have also made a couple of bids for Brentford forward Bryan Mbeumo with the Bees using the fee Man Utd paid for Cunha as a guide to how much they want for the Cameroon international.",
      "And Scholes has urged Man Utd to sign Eze – who could be available for £68m – after the Crystal Palace star was one of the only bright sparks for Tuchel’s side on a miserable evening on Tuesday.",
      "READ: Transfer rumour power ranking: Wirtz to Liverpool for record fee as Chelsea fail to sign Gittens",
      "Scholes posted a picture of Eze in an England shirt onto his Instagram story with the caption: “Just buy him.”",
      "Former Man Utd striker Dwight Yorke also recently urged the Red Devils to sign Eze as it’s a “no-brainer”.",
      "Yorke said: “Eberechi Eze at Crystal Palace would be perfect for Manchester United.",
      "“Yeah, he scored at the weekend in the FA Cup final, but it’s not just about that. A year ago, maybe more, I said this kid and Michael Olise – who went to Bayern – United should buy them for £100 million. Put £100m down and you will get two fantastic players.",
      "“Instead, they listened to the figures in the hierarchy, which is understandable, but it’s glaring just how good these two are.",
      "“Eze has the decision-making, the talent, he’s a good athlete, he can create and score. He’s at the right age to step up and play on a bigger platform. It’s a no-brainer.”",
      "And another former Man Utd player, Teddy Sheringham, reckons Eze “could walk into” the Red Devils side, as well as Arsenal’s if the Gunners were interested.",
      "Sheringham told Prime Casino: “I think he could walk into the likes of Manchester United and Arsenal’s first team, and he would be a brilliant option for other clubs. City have been linked with him, I can see him fitting into Pep’s style of play because he’s a very gifted footballer.",
      "“You know, they’re all wanting better players and he’s playing at the top of his game at the moment and looks fantastic. So, any one of those clubs would be wanting him. Manchester United could definitely do with someone like that.”",
      "Manchester United have reportedly looked at a pair of stars from the same club who could cost a combined £148million, and one of them will do anything he “possibly can ...",
      "Tottenham have reportedly made an offer for Crystal Palace star Eberechi Eze after his heroics at Wembley over the weekend.",
      "An Arsenal move for an Aston Villa star this summer has been described as “interesting” given the lack of game time he’d been getting recently.",
      "Manchester City are reportedly preparing to part with £120million in order to sign a star duo from the same club as replacements for two of their biggest names.",
      "Manchester United have been handed a huge boost along with a number of other Premier League clubs after the Crystal Palace star told the club he wants to leave this ...",
      "Man Utd are considering a £68m move for Crystal Palace star Eberechi Eze this summer and have ‘agreed a deal’ for a French wondered."

      "Each day we’re ranking the top 20 rumours involving Premier League clubs, the higher the link, the more likely we feel they are to becoming done deals.",
      "So we start with the tittle-tattle…",
      "",
      "20) Gianluigi Donnarumma – PSG to Manchester United\nDonnarumma sees Old Trafford as a ‘tempting destination’, does he? Or is it that the Italy keeper has been in contract talks with PSG for months and he isn’t getting what he wants so his representatives are pulling the oldest trick in the agents’ book? You decide.",
      "19) Hugo Ekitike – Eintracht Frankfurt to Chelsea\nYou could substitute Chelsea for Liverpool at any point here while discussing the rumours around Ekitike. Both clubs are interested but each have the same problem: Eintracht Frankfurt and their insistence on £85million.",
      "",
      "18) 🔽 Mike Maignan – AC Milan to Chelsea\nChelsea are being weird here. They wanted Maignan in for the Club World Cup but refused to pay more than £10-12million, only just over half the price Milan want to sell the France no.1. Now the Blues can’t take him to USA, they don’t want him at all. That makes such little sense that it probably isn’t as dead as Chelsea want us to believe.",
      "",
      "17) 🆕 Victor Osimhen – Napoli to Manchester United\nOsimhen apparently fancies a move to Old Trafford, presumably because he’s seen the salaries United have been dishing out in recent years. Napoli want around £70million, though they may take Joshua Zirkzee in part-exchange. This one doesn’t pass the sniff test, unless we get to late in the window with all parties in the same position they are now.",
      "",
      "",
      "15) 🆕 Jack Grealish – Manchester City to Bayer Leverkusen\nThere was talk of interest from Newcastle, which was a move we could really get on board with. But a loan with a £67milion obligation always seemed a little fanciful on City’s part. A £40million deal to replace Florian Wirtz at Leverkusen seems more like the kind of fee City would take for a player with no future under Guardiola, but we’d still rather Grealish stuck around in the Premier League.",

      "",
      "12) Luis Diaz – Liverpool to Barcelona\nOur reading on this: Barca want Diaz, who would be happy to move to the Nou Camp. Liverpool might be interested in a deal, but only on their terms. Which Barca won’t meet, and Diaz knows it so he won’t kick up a fuss – yet. If this is going to happen, someone needs to change tack. Which doesn’t seem likely any time soon.",

      "11) Joao Pedro – Brighton to Newcastle\nThe Seagulls forward is intent on leaving Brighton to take the next step but apparently, wherever he goes, he wants to be the first choice. Fine, but he won’t get that at Newcastle while Alexander Isak is around. For how long will that be? That is the more pressing concern for Newcastle fans.",

      "9) 🔽 Benjamin Sesko – RB Leipzig to Arsenal\nThe Slovenia striker had overtaken Gyokeres as the favourite to fill the gaping chasm in the centre of Arsenal’s attack after much deliberation on the Gunners’ part. But perhaps they hadn’t accounted for how much of a slog it would be to negotiate with RB Leipzig, who are refusing to accept anything under their £70million valuation. As is their right. Especially when Al-Hilal seem keen to cough up if Sesko can be convinced to move to Saudi.",
      "",
      "8) 🔼 Viktor Gyokeres – Sporting to Manchester United\nWith Arsenal going cold on Gyokeres, there were plenty of reports that the Swede is open to a move to Old Trafford after all. Which may be a consequence of the queue at Sporting’s door being more sparse than many of us expected. But if United can get it done, it would be a step on the road to regaining some credibility.",
      "",
      "7) 🆕 James Trafford – Burnley to Newcastle\nWord is that Newcastle and Burnley are haggling over the price of a deal that Eddie Howe wanted to do a year ago, with the intention of Trafford and Nick Pope slugging it out for the No.1 spot. Which rarely ever works. Or at least that’s what Howe might tell Pope, but if this comes off, the current Toon keeper’s days are numbered.",
      "",
      "6) 🔼 Bryan Mbeumo – Brentford to Manchester United\nTottenham’s renewed interest threatened to scupper United’s hopes of landing Mbeumo but even the prospect of following Thomas Frank to Spurs isn’t deterring the forward from pursuing a move to Old Trafford. He’ll get his way ‘soon’, apparently.",
      "",
      "5) Kepa Arrizabalaga – Chelsea to Arsenal\nThis one is moving quick, apparently, with Arsenal aware that the world’s most expensive goalkeeper will cost them just £5million.

      "Thomas Frank plans to mark his leap up the Premier League pecking order by making Bryan Mbeumo his first signing, copying an expensive move Man Utd ‘never wanted’.",
      "Frank is expected to be appointed Spurs manager shortly after the north London club struck up an agreement with Brentford to make the Dane one of the most expensive coaches in Premier League history.",
      "But the plundering of Brentford might not stop there as Frank has ‘demanded’ that Bryan Mbeumo accompany him on the trip to Spurs, who will have to hijack Man Utd’s move for the forward.",
      "It would not be the first time a manager has joined a bigger club and made sure one of his players joins him – although Spurs will hope it goes better than most of these examples.",
      "",
      "Marouane Fellaini\nDavid Moyes “never wanted Marouane Fellaini to be my first Man Utd signing”, but the subtext is hilarious and crucial.",
      "While he always intended to pack the Belgian among his belongings for the trip from Everton to Old Trafford, the manager was painfully aware of The Optics in using the rare transfer pull of one of the biggest clubs in world football to immediately bring in a relatively uncultured player from his old club.",
      "But Ed Woodward somehow contrived to deliver an even more embarrassing scenario in his first and worst transfer window at Man Utd. Fellaini was the only signing handed down to Moyes after futile pursuits of Cristiano Ronaldo, Gareth Bale, Thiago Alcantara, Cesc Fabregas, Ander Herrera and Fabio Coentrao, among a great many others.",
      "“I knew, coming from my old club, the look of him was never going to be [right for United],” Moyes added. It undeniably contributed to the sheer incompetence of Man Utd signing Fellaini for £27.5m on September 3, despite there being a release clause in his contract making him £4m cheaper up to July 31.",
      "Not that Moyes’ concern over perception prevented the club from making a joint bid for Fellaini and Leighton Baines earlier that summer.",
      "The tales of Rio Ferdinand and Nemanja Vidic being shown tapes of Phil Jagielka are regrettably apocryphal but it is without doubt that a manager out of his depth clutched a comfort blanket that carried the scent of Goodison Park as his big career break ended in inevitable failure.",
      "Then again, as Sunderland manager a few years later Moyes openly said of Fellaini and Adnan Januzaj that he would “drive down to Manchester and pick them up” if a deal was possible, so the bloke obviously just values familiarity.",
      "",
      "Arouna Kone\nIt is remarkable that Moyes jumping up to Man Utd was not the most absurd case of overpromotion those circumstances produced. Rarely ever has a manager failed upwards quite so impressively as Roberto Martinez with Everton.",
      "The Spaniard arrived at Goodison Park as the Moyes replacement armed with an FA Cup winner’s medal, but the addition of a Premier League relegation on his CV suggested the arrangement might not end so well.",
      "A brilliant first season was the precursor to two years of expensive backwards steps, by which point Martinez was sacked and again ludicrously fell higher up the managerial ladder by being entrusted with the Golden Generations of both Belgium and Portugal.",
      "Martinez surely spent his first days in both posts investigating the genealogy of his old Wigan squad. His first signing at Everton was that of Kone, who described it as “an honour to be back working with the manager once again”.",
      "James McCarthy made the same jump soon afterwards, passing Fellaini in the Finch Farm reception on deadline day as Man Utd, Everton and Wigan crystallised their respective places in the football food chain to an unnecessary extent.",
      "",
      "Richarlison\nFrank will inherit a fractured Spurs dressing room in any case but the undying support of one player would have been guaranteed with a different intra-Premier League appointment.",
      "Richarlison specifically cited how he felt it was “important for me here to be with Marco Silva again” when Everton “spoiled” the entire transfer window by signing him in summer 2018.",
      "The pair had first crossed paths at Watford when Silva personally intervened to hijack the Brazilian’s planned move to Ajax. The Hornets sacked Silva five months later in a rare show of impatience with a manager, who landed at Everton by the summer.",
      "His first port of call was to link back up with Richarlison who, for his many faults, helped keep the Toffees up and never lacked for effort before leaving at a profit when Spurs came calling in summer 2022.",
      "",
      "Joe Allen\n“We have got some protection on Brendan coming back for our players in the initial period, which I think is the right thing,” Swansea chairman Huw Jenkins said of a gentleman’s agreement – or what he termed “a 12-month respite” – designed to prevent Liverpool from raiding the Welsh club for anything more than their manager.",
      "It lasted all of 70 days. While Rodgers reunited with former Swansea loanee Fabio Borini in his first signing as head coach at Anfield, the Northern Irishman immediately went back on that handshake deal with his former employers to return for Allen.",
      "A furious Swansea lambasted Liverpool for reneging on “a written agreement” not to sign any of their players within a year of Rodgers’ appointment, but a clause which permitted Allen to join the Reds, Arsenal, Chelsea, Manchester City or Man Utd for £15m overrode any informal accord.",
      "Swansea, realising Rodgers was likely willing to drag them through every court around the globe and fight to the death to sign a player so courageous, relented and decided to just win the League Cup with Ki Sung-yueng instead.",
      "",
      "Jermain Defoe\nIt is one of the great bits of Barclays folklore that the 18 most expensive signings in Harry Redknapp’s 34-year, almost 1,400-game managerial career only actually involve 15 players.",
      "Sandro ranks 18th and 12th. Peter Crouch is 8th and 5th. And Defoe comes 14th and 2nd. It is an unfathomably effective way of saying someone managed Spurs, Portsmouth and QPR without explicitly stating it.",
      "And the only thing preventing Niko Kranjcar from making that list is that he did not cost all that much on any of the three separate occasions Redknapp signed him.",
      "“This is the third club I have signed him for. I know what a top-class player he is,” Redknapp said after making Defoe his first signing as Spurs manager in January 2009, spending £15m on a player he bought for £9m as Portsmouth boss 12 months before, and West Ham poached for £1m or so before the turn of the millennium.",
      "That shared history spawned one of the great Redknapp stories – how he downplayed the need for Defoe to undergo a medical before completing the deadline day rule-breaking Portsmouth move “because he knew me from a kid and that” – but it was in north London where he laid the foundations for success on those diminutive but broad shoulders as his first purchase.",
      "Ruben Amorim’s new left-back won’t have too much difficulty in making more of a mark at Man Utd than the first signings of the post-Fergie managers.",
      "Nottingham Forest are throwing their weight around with plans for signings which were previously unrealistic. Either break transfer records or all the rules."

      "The centre-half had played a key part in their rise from the Championship and as that year’s official Promoted Team That Makes A Load Of New Signings, it made perfect sense from Villa’s viewpoint if no-one else’s. An England squad place arrived a few months later and the Villa captaincy followed in 2021, much to Steven Gerrard’s future chagrin.",

      "18) Jobe Bellingham (Sunderland to Borussia Dortmund, £27.8m to £32m, June 2025)\nOther interested parties included Bundesliga rivals Leipzig and Frankfurt but it is a remarkably strong pitch to simply ask a player how their brother is doing. Dortmund primed Jude for superstardom and Jobe will be eyeing those footsteps like any other hand-me-down.",

The only difference this time was the ridicule he faced upon that switch to north London as a twice-relegated keeper signed as back-up for Bernd Leno.",

      "6) Elliot Anderson (Newcastle to Nottingham Forest, £35m, July 2024)\nIt instinctively felt like an absurd fee but a few factors explained that final number beyond PSR-based cynicism.",
      "Anderson, a young and highly-rated player in a position Forest were openly desperate to reinforce, was on a long-term contract with a Premier League rival. And ultimately the back-scratching transfer of Odysseas Vlachodimos between the two clubs effectively offset about £20m of the valuation of a player on the England periphery.",
      "",
      "5) Morgan Gibbs-White (Wolves to Nottingham Forest, £25m to £44.5m, August 2022)\nIt feels as though a fair amount of those add-ons might well have been triggered by any of 18 goals, 28 assists, the avoidance of relegation, European qualification or England recognition.",
      "",
      "4) Max Kilman (Wolves to West Ham, £40m, July 2024)\nAn England international of 25 caps, but in futsal rather than association football. That actually prevented Kilman from making a proposed switch in allegiance to represent Ukraine from Euro 2021 onwards, leaving the Three Lions as his only route to playing for a country.",
      "His consistency for Wolves put him on the fringes of an England call-up and a £40m move to West Ham should theoretically have been the final push. But he doesn’t feel particularly close to breaking through under Thomas Tuchel.",
      "",
      "3) Anthony Gordon (Everton to Newcastle, £40m, January 2023)\nIt was assumed by many that Newcastle had taken leave of their entire senses when throwing as much as £45m at Everton for a forward with seven goals and eight assists in 78 games.",
      "Gordon already outstripped both before hitting that appearance mark at Newcastle, until Liverpool speculation left his ‘head in a mess’.",
      "This past season was a little slower for the Gordon bandwagon but someone had to make way for Jacob Murphy’s Ballon d’Or push.",
      "",
      "2) Cole Palmer (Manchester City to Chelsea, £40m to £42.5m, September 2023)\nIt is easy to forget just how ludicrous this move was at the time.",
      "It made absolutely no sense: Chelsea did not need yet another young, exciting forward and if Palmer was of the requisite quality, Manchester City would never have let him go.",
      "But Chelsea have thrown more than enough at the wall for some to stick and Palmer was the shoot of inspiration rather than yet another questionable deal. By the end of the year he had become their most important player and that responsibility only increased to the tune of an England debut, goal and place in their European Championship squad, as well as a goal in the final.",
      "Palmer had played just 41 games at senior level when Chelsea signed him for the rough equivalent of around £1m per career appearance. It has gone well.",
      "",
      "1) Aaron Wan-Bissaka (Crystal Palace to Manchester United, £45m to £50m, July 2019)\nCrystal Palace supporters probably felt that it was the usual show of big club bias from Southgate to not cap Wan-Bissaka, then call him up two months after he joined Manchester United. But the emergence of Eberechi Eze, Marc Guehi and Adam Wharton proved Palace to be the former manager’s favourite club, and Wan-Bissaka remains as uncapped at Old Trafford as he ever was at Selhurst Park.",
      "He will have known that the England door closed long before he officially switched allegiance to DR Congo in May 2025. Wan-Bissaka is still yet to represent them after withdrawing from the June internationals due to ‘personal medical reasons’, but even when he does make that first international appearance, he will remain England’s most expensive uncapped player ever at least in spirit.",
      "Liverpool had have one Florian Wirtz bid rejected and may not find success with a second falling short of Leverkusen’s valuation. They have been here before.",
      "Cole Palmer was poor in an infuriatingly tepid England performance vs Andorra, while Noni Madueke was comfortably Thomas Tuchel’s best player…",
      "Bryan Mbeumo will almost definitely be taking a step down to complete his dream move to Manchester United, and few have done so at greater expense.",
      "Noni Madueke and Robert Sanchez are on a list of 14 players put up for sale by Chelsea this summer, and Cole Palmer has been tipped for a shock exit.",
      "The imminent signing of Florian Wirtz at Liverpool “isn’t going to stop” the Reds from attempting to sign Anthony Gordon, according to reports.",
      "Cole Palmer has spoken of his excitement to play in Chelsea’s Europa Conference League final amid heading praise on Enzo Maresca."

      "2) Manchester City – £63m\nThat’s the price of a Rayan Ait-Nouri from Wolves and a Rayan Cherki from Lyon and both feel like bargains.",

Throw in the £30m signing of Liam Delap and the Blues are already making very expensive waves."

      "These are the 10 best wide forwards available in the 2025 summer transfer window. Arsenal, Liverpool, Newcastle and Chelsea should be taking notes…",
      "And here are the best available strikers.",
      "",
      "10) Jack Grealish (Manchester City)\nThere are younger options like Antony, Kenan Yildiz, Johan Bakayoko and Tyler Dibling (that’s the honourable mentions out of the way), but we reckon Jack Grealish just edges them. Why? SEO, maybe. But also because he’s a Premier League-proven talent who, under the right manager, can still be one of the most dangerous wingers in Europe.",
      "We’re not sure if Grealish is the type of player who lacks confidence, but what we do know is that the freedom and eccentricity he once oozed has been stripped away under Pep Guardiola. He was electric at Aston Villa, prompting Man City to break the British transfer record to sign him, only to reinvent him as a risk-averse wide-midfielder who keeps the ball safe at all costs. Jeremy Doku, by contrast, has been given a free pass to run at full-backs like it’s a playground kickabout.",
      "Someone needs to get us the old Grealish back. We miss him dearly.",
      "",
      "9) Antoine Semenyo (Bournemouth)\nAfter racking up 11 goals and six assists in 37 Premier League games, Antoine Semenyo is a wanted man. He really does strike us as a future Tottenham Hotspur player, and with them back in the Champions League, the Ghanaian will surely be tempted – even more so if Daniel Levy swaps Ange Postecoglou for Andoni Iraola.",
      "Semenyo, still raw at 25, had a highly productive season. Bournemouth reportedly want £70million – which he’s definitely not worth. Fair enough for them to aim high, but thankfully for everyone’s sake, Manchester United can’t afford to get suckered in. Then again, they might lose the plot after Liam Delap chose Chelsea. Spurs are also reportedly keen.",
      "",
      "8) Takefusa Kubo (Real Sociedad)\nThere’s a £50.2million release clause in Kubo’s contract, with Real Madrid due 50% of any sale – meaning they could bring him back for a bargain £25m if they wanted. But Los Blancos already have more attacking depth than they know what to do with. Arda Guler and Brahim Diaz barely get a look-in as it is.",
      "Kubo was one of Europe’s top take-on artists in 2024/25, even if five goals and zero assists in 36 La Liga games is bleak. Still, Alexander Isak only got six in his final season at Sociedad, and he’s done alright since.",
      "The Japanese winger is a menace in possession, with progressive carry and foul-winning numbers that compare well with Mo Salah, Raphinha, Lamine Yamal and Vinicius Jr. He’s also one of the best defensive workers among that group. There’s a serious Premier League player in there.",
      "",
      "7) Marcus Rashford (Manchester United)\nAre we naïve to keep convincing ourselves he’s still a potentially elite forward? Possibly. But Marcus Rashford’s brief resurgence on loan at Aston Villa reignited that belief. Confidence and happiness make all the difference, and for the first time in ages, he looked like he was enjoying himself.",
      "Playing for Manchester United could make Mr Tumble miserable these days. It’s a graveyard for players. McTominay, Antony and Rashford have all escaped and immediately thrived elsewhere. Actual Scott McTominay has been named Serie A’s best player, for crying out loud.",
      "Wages are the stumbling block. Only a few clubs can afford his wages, and many might think twice. Did Rashford down tools after signing a big-money contract extension, or was he just another victim of the Old Trafford malaise?",
      "Either way, the Villa revival has been massive. A move abroad may be best, but don’t rule out an intra-Premier League switch.",
      "",
      "6) Leroy Sane (Bayern Munich)\nA free transfer makes Leroy Sane a very tasty proposition. He’s Prem-proven, which matters, but he hasn’t played in England since 2020 and is now 29 – just a year younger than a finished Raheem Sterling.",
      "He’s reportedly been offered to Spurs and Arsenal. Galatasaray and Fenerbahce have also reportedly offered the German big money. As a freebie, his wage demands will be monstrous, and he’ll want a long contract well into his twilight.",
      "But if you can stomach the wages, there’s no transfer fee, and he remains a brilliant addition for a top club.",
      "",
      "5) Jamie Gittens (Borussia Dortmund)\nA transfer to Chelsea looks extremely likely for the promising young winger, who scored 12 goals and provided five assists in 48 matches for Dortmund in 2024/25.",
      "The Blues want Gittens for the Club World Cup and are actively pursuing him, submitting a new €50m bid on Tuesday. If that fails, they won’t give up, and when the transfer window re-opens, they will surely land the 20-year-old – who has reportedly ‘ignored’ interest from Arsenal to pursue a move to west London.",
      "",
      "4) Bryan Mbeumo (Brentford)\nTwenty Premier League goals this season says it all, really. At 25, Mbeumo is a proven scorer, versatile, and should be available for a cut-price fee with just one year left on his deal.",
      "He feels like a can’t-miss signing. Arsenal, Newcastle and Man United have all been linked. Surprisingly, he wants to join the Red Devils over the other two clubs. Thomas Frank to Spurs could throw a spanner in the works, though…",
      "Newcastle need a right-winger despite Jacob Murphy’s freak season. Arsenal wouldn’t start him ahead of Bukayo Saka, but there’s a world where they co-exist, even if pushing either to the left isn’t ideal.",
      "Still, Mbeumo would improve any top side needing an X-factor.",
      "",
      "3) Nico Williams (Athletic Club)\nA £45m release clause for a player of Nico Williams’ talent is outrageous. But the full cost – including wages and bonuses – makes him an expensive project. Barcelona have walked away. Last summer, Arsenal and Chelsea didn’t bite the bullet.",
      "His Euro 2024 was electric, but five goals and five assists for Bilbao this past season didn’t boost his stock much. That said, the talent is unquestionable. He’s ready for a step up.",
      "",
      "2) Rafael Leao (AC Milan)\nIt feels like time for Leao to leave Milan. Chelsea are probably out – they’re welcoming Estevao and Kendry Paez this summer – but Arsenal’s need for a left-winger is glaring. How they let Khvicha Kvaratskhelia go to PSG without a fight is baffling.",
      "With Grealish likely off and Doku not fully convincing, City could come calling too. Newcastle or Liverpool would also make sense – the former especially, as Leao would be a major statement.",
      "His performance in the Nations League final for Portugal would have convinced a few potential suitors.",
      "",
      "1) Rodrygo (Real Madrid)\nIf Arsenal sign Rodrygo, it would have real Alexis Sanchez vibes. A genuine elite winger, an X-factor star, and the sort of player who deserves to be more than a supporting act.",
      "Real Madrid are all about Kylian Mbappe, Jude Bellingham and Vinicius now. Rodrygo, despite being a proven match-winner with two Champions Leagues and three La Liga titles, seems expendable.",
      "He should be one of the poster boys at a top club – and most English sides can offer him that. He might just be the best player available this summer.",
      "READ NOW: How Andrea Berta should spend his £300m to win Arsenal the Premier League title",

      "These 10 Premier League players probably won’t be at the 2026 World Cup if they don’t move clubs in the summer transfer window.",
      "",
      "Jean-Philippe Mateta (Crystal Palace and France)\nThere’s not much more Mateta can do at Crystal Palace to prove to Didier Deschamps that he’s worthy of a place in his France squad. He did enough for Thierry Henry to include him in the Olympics squad last year – as one of the three over-23 players – after scoring 14 goals in the second half of the 2023/24 Premier League season.",
      "After another 14 goals – this time across the whole of 2024/25 – Mateta still isn’t in Deschamps’ thinking. It might take a move away from Palace to change that. Will Europa League exploits be enough? Manchester United could do a lot worse…",
      "",
      "Jack Grealish (Manchester City and England)\nIt’s not gone particularly well for Grealish at Man City, though he has plenty of winner’s medals from his four years in Manchester. His goal and assist numbers have consistently disappointed and his best – and debatably only successful – campaign on an individual level came in 2022/23, when he played a crucial role in the club’s historic Treble-winning season.",
      "His inclusion in Lee Carsley’s first England squad raised a few eyebrows and rightly so, but the winger justified the decision with a goal against the Republic of Ireland – a delicious narrative drawn up by football’s scriptwriters. But Thomas Tuchel has not picked Grealish in his first two squads and the ex-Aston Villa captain now has a lot of work to do to earn a World Cup place.",
      "There’s no question that Grealish has to leave City this summer. That’s not just for the sake of his international career, but his career full stop. Pep Guardiola’s rotation bingo can frustrate the best, and while injuries haven’t helped, his transformation under Pep has been for the worse. The exciting, direct, risk-taking Grealish we loved has been stripped away. A move would help him rediscover himself – and maybe a place on the plane.",
      "Is he joining Liverpool? No but…",
      "",
      "Joao Pedro (Brighton and Brazil)\nIt doesn’t look like Pedro has much of a future at Brighton, with Chelsea reportedly interested in taking him off the Seagulls’ hands. A split seems inevitable after being left out of Fabian Hurzeler’s final two squads of the season following a training ground altercation (reportedly with Jan Paul van Hecke). Given he was the fall guy, we suspect Pedro was the one in the wrong.",
      "Brazil’s No.9 spot is wide open. New coach Carlo Ancelotti might prefer a winger through the middle – perhaps Rodrygo – but if he wants a more natural option, Pedro could still emerge as the go-to guy. The competition is Richarlison and Gabriel Jesus. Which says it all, really.",
      "Move to a bigger club, play more consistently, even just slightly up his game – and Pedro could be leading the line for Brazil next summer.",
      "",
      "Joshua Zirkzee (Manchester United and Netherlands)\nHe’s only been at Old Trafford a year, but that’s more than enough time for anyone. United’s summer intentions are clear: improve in attack. That doesn’t bode well for Zirkzee, who’s a long shot for Ronald Koeman’s World Cup squad as things stand.",
      "Zirkzee clearly has technical ability, but he’s lacked the physicality and end product to thrive in the Premier League. There’s been talk of a Serie A return – even on loan – and with Matheus Cunha already in, Bryan Mbeumo likely to follow, and a proper No.9 on the agenda, minutes will be hard to come by. No one knows his best position and there’s no European football to help showcase himself either.",
      "",
      "Christopher Nkunku (Chelsea and France)\nTalk of Nkunku leaving Chelsea isn’t new. Ending his Blues nightmare is essential to getting his career back on track and giving France another goalscoring option.",
      "Before moving to Stamford Bridge, he was one of Europe’s most highly rated forwards; he claimed 23 goals and nine assists in his final season at RB Leipzig after notching 35 goal contributions in the Bundesliga the year before. At Chelsea, he’s done well in the cups and Europe (11 goals in 15 games) but he’s barely started in the Premier League.",
      "Liam Delap’s arrival from Ipswich means even fewer minutes next season. Buying Nkunku is a risk, sure, but a calculated one. For the club, the player and for France, who could really do with Leipzig-era Nkunku in North America.",

      "The Red Devils are desperate to sign a new striker this summer after struggling to score goals in the Premier League last season.",
      "Only four Premier League sides scored fewer goals than Man Utd last term as they finished 15th under Ruben Amorim, who replaced Erik ten Hag in November.",
      "Joshua Zirkzee and Rasmus Hojlund scored just seven Premier League goals between them and the Red Devils are looking for a proven goalscorer to lead the line.",

      "A move for Gyokeres had been seen as unlikely after they failed to qualify for the Champions League but journalist Ben Jacobs recently claimed the Sweden international would be ‘keen’ on a move to Old Trafford regardless.",
      "Jacobs told The United Stand: “My understanding is that Viktor Gyokeres would be very keen on a move to Man United if they could pull that off, financially speaking.",
      "“I don’t think Gyokeres would be on £300,000 a week or more. So if Rashford and Sancho go they’ve got wage bill space to invest in these players, so that’s why if they bite the bullet on the transfer and agent fees, if they structure it in a way where they can start in the next financial year and get it on flexible instalments, it can be a way they can do that deal.”",

      "“So Sesko is the clear favourite, there are conversations ongoing. But it’s still not a done deal. So until the Sesko deal is a done we have to be careful.",
      "“At the moment Sesko remains the favourite, Viktor Gyokeres remains the other option on the table, but as it’s now two or three weeks that Arsenal are still not advancing on the Gyokeres deal, all the other clubs keep calling his agents.",
      "“That’s what happened in the last 48 hours over the weekend. From what I heard, last week Man Utd had new contacts with Viktor Gyokeres’ camp, to be informed on the situation, something like ‘okay, if Arsenal are not doing the deal we are still there, we are still interested’.",
      "“Then for Man Utd we have to see financially how they can make it happen, because with Champions League football I’m 99 per cent convinced that they were going to close the Gyokeres deal quite quick. That was the feeling.",
      "“Then no Champions League football, they lost the [Europa League] final in Bilbao, and so it’s more complicated financially.",

      "The Magpies would qualify for the Champions League at the end of that season, with Isak’s goals a critical factor in helping transform Eddie Howe’s side. Yet it was Guimaraes who boarded the ship when the shore was a speck in the distance.",

      "",
      "9) Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang\nThings did not work out in a way that suited any party. The captain’s armband was stripped, the non-negotiables were ignored, backs were stabbed and the contract Arsenal were desperate for Aubameyang to sign after winning them the FA Cup was written off months early.",
      "Yet for a time there was talk of statues, proof of leadership, the glory of trophies and the scoring of more Premier League goals than Alexis Sanchez in fewer appearances than Philippe Senderos.",
      "It is a truly imperious record for Arsene Wenger’s last signing as a manager. A club-record fee was needed to extract Aubameyang from Borussia Dortmund, the Gabon international departing as the Bundesliga’s Player of the Year in 2016 and Golden Boot winner of 2017. By the time it came to leaving Germany in January 2018, Arsenal were sixth in the Premier League and locked in the existential crisis that was their first year outside the Champions League since 2000.",

      "Jurgen Klopp ultimately put it best:",
      "“I always tell players if, when you are 35 or 36, you look back on your career and think about the one year you didn’t play Champions League, then you are really a poor boy. There are so many things you can do and reach if you go together with the team. You can qualify for the Champions League, play Champions League, maybe win it or whatever. That is a much more satisfying thing than all the rest. That is what I would say to players: ‘It is about pushing the train, not jumping on a running train.’ That is what we need here. If somebody says: ‘But you don’t play Champions League next year’, then goodbye and thank you, have fun next year wherever you will be. We will find players or we have players already that will go our way. That is not my way, that is the normal way for a club not playing in the Champions League.”",
      "The German did not have to worry about it often, only coaching two full Liverpool seasons outside Europe’s elite competition, but it was true. The Reds signed Sadio Mane 88 days later and Klopp secured one of the strongest pushers of his Champions League train in the process.",
      "Not only were the Reds out of Europe altogether in summer 2016, but they had finished two places below the Southampton side they were buying from. Mane bet not only on himself but the Klopp vision. A Premier League, Champions League, Super Cup, Club World Cup and Golden Boot suggests he was right.",

      "It was understandable to an extent. The Reds, managed by Jurgen Klopp, had just finished seven places higher than the Blues, who were a bastion of instability and player churn. The decision between the two seemed obvious once it was clear both were willing to make it worth Brighton’s trouble.",
      "But players tend not to glance at the most recent league table before making career calls. Caicedo took the most expensive step down in Premier League history and has played a considerable part in pulling Chelsea back up since.",

      "Some will put that down to money, or more specifically the pressure selling club Lille reportedly applied on Yoro to take the more lucrative Manchester United offer.",
      "But for a Europa League club to capture such a coveted teenager was yet more proof of that unique allure Manchester United still possess. Yoro was seven when they had last won the title and still in nappies for their most recent Champions League crowning, yet Old Trafford still called.",
      "",
      "5) Luis Suarez\nWhile he would win the Champions League with Barcelona in 2015, Suarez had only graced the competition proper in one season, scoring a solitary goal during the 2010/11 campaign in which Ajax exited at the group stage.",
      "He joined Liverpool later that season and by the time he had finally dragged them to European Cup qualification for the first time in half a decade in 2014, the Uruguayan forewent the fruits of his labour to rock up in Spain.",
      "Liverpool had finished seventh before Suarez joined, then sixth, eighth and seventh with him. But the forward was not tainted by those years of stagnation, scoring more than 50 goals.

He left for Barcelona instead of sticking around long enough for Brendan Rodgers to put him on the bench at the Bernabeu.",
      "",
      "4) Zlatan Ibrahimovic\nFrom his humble beginnings at Ajax in 2002/03 to the understated modesty that helped steer Paris Saint-Germain in 2015/16, Ibrahimovic did not miss a single Champions League campaign. He played at least six games in every season including and between those two quarter-final appearances, failing to score only when Igor Biscan belittled him in 2004/05.",
      "But it was neither injury nor under-performance that snapped that remarkable streak. Ibrahimovic instead vacated his seat at the European top table entirely of his own accord – by joining Manchester United.",
      "Louis van Gaal had sidestepped the first sign of the Pardpocalypse by quelling any Wembley dad dancing in the FA Cup final. The Dutchman also took Manchester United to within goal difference of the Champions League places but that was not enough and so Jose Mourinho was appointed. One of his first moves was to orchestrate the arrival of Ibrahimovic, who proceeded to talk the considerable talk while actually walking the quite brilliant walk.",
      "But the significant knee knack he suffered in the Europa League quarter-final meant he would play only one Champions League game for Manchester United. He holds the record of most different clubs represented in the European Cup at seven, even if his solitary match in the competition for the Red Devils was as a second-half substitute in defeat to Basel.",
      "",
      "3) N’Golo Kante\nA peculiar set of circumstances meant the £30m departure of the midfielder most vital to a Premier League title win for a team that had finished 10th passed by without much consternation or controversy.",
      "Leicester resigned themselves to the idea that Kante would be the first noteworthy cab off the King Power rank and Chelsea duly obliged after Arsenal pulled out of the running over seemingly extortionate agent fees.",
      "Kante thus had to wait until September 2017 for his first taste of the Champions League, missing out on Leicester’s journey to the quarter-final the previous year and instead busying himself winning a consecutive Premier League title. The Frenchman would claim his European Cup by 2021 as man of the match in the final, cementing a legacy of making up for lost time and receiving the ultimate award for what was quite the leap of faith five years previous.",
      "Chelsea were out of European competition completely but still signed the epitome of a Champions League calibre player as Kante called “the opportunity to work with Antonio Conte, a brilliant coach… simply too good to turn down”.",
      "It is unknown if he felt the same way about Frank Lampard.",
      "",
      "2) Angel di Maria\nHe was an ill fit, a ‘complete fanny’, the polar opposite to what his manager sought and emblematic of a period during which the club favoured style over substance in the transfer market. Manchester United made a loss on Di Maria less than a year after his purchase for good reason.",
      "But it was a monumental capture at the time, albeit a flexing of superficial muscles to stroke an ego bruised by one failed post-Sir Alex Ferguson season. Manchester United finished the 2013/14 campaign in seventh and under the caretaker guidance of Ryan Giggs; Di Maria ended it as man of the match in the Champions League final and leading assist provider in La Liga with 18, having scored in a Copa del Rey final win over Barcelona.",

His reign as the most expensive footballer ever lasted a solitary year before Neymar made the £89.3m Manchester United paid Juventus look like a Willian Prunier clean sheet bonus. Yet often forgotten is one of the many wrinkles in that deal: the pull of home, Mourinho or infuriating Graeme Souness on a weekly basis persuaded one of the best young players around to abandon a recent Champions League finalist and serial Serie A title winner for whatever state Van Gaal left Old Trafford in.",

      "Wednesday 11 June 2025 10:08, UK",
      "As the summer's first transfer window slams shut, Premier League clubs have spent nearly half a billion on new signings - and there is still so much business to be done.",
      "Few knew what to expect from this special window brought in ahead of the Club World Cup - but it has delivered 10 days of transfer drama and set the tone for what promises to be a fascinating summer. And we are just six days away from it re-opening.",
      "Manchester City have been the big spenders thus far after doing their business early by bringing in Tijjani Reijnders, Rayan Cherki, Rayan Ait Nouri and Marcus Bettinelli - taking their outlay to £116.2m.",
      "Despite three of City's signings being announced on Deadline Day, it was Chelsea, the other Premier League team at the Club World Cup, that were centre of attention once again as they chased potential late deals for Jamie Gittens and Mike Maignan.",
      "Chelsea ended their pursuit of Maignan, the AC Milan goalkeeper, around lunchtime because the Italian club were unwilling to lower their demands for the 29-year-old, who is out of contract in a year and valued at no more than £12m by the Blues.",
      "Their chase for Gittens had more legs but also ended in disappointment - for now at least. Dortmund rejected Chelsea's £42m bid and demanded closer to £55m late in the day and time ran out for the clubs to come to an agreement.",
      "Chelsea were happy to wait as they do not want to overpay for Gittens and plan to revisit the deal further down the line. Gittens, who wants to move to Chelsea, appeared frustrated as he sped out of Dortmund's training ground at day's end.",
      "Dortmund were able to get an incoming deal over the line ahead of the tournament as they signed Jobe Bellingham from Sunderland in a club-record sale for the newly-promoted Premier League club, who are receiving an initial £27.8m for the 19-year-old.",
      "Before Bellingham's exit, the Black Cats had confirmed the club-record £20m signing of midfielder Enzo Le Fee after a successful loan spell from Roma.",
      "Premier League clubs have splashed nearly £500m after only 10 days of the first summer window, which is already close to half the amount spent during the entire 2021/22 summer window.",
      "Manchester City have been the most spendthrift club as Pep Guardiola's side look to rebuild after a disappointing campaign, spending a table-topping £116.3m so far.",
      "At the other end of the scale, Wolves are nearly £100m in profit after selling star players Matheus Cunha and Rayan Ait Nouri.",
      "Burnley and Chelsea lead the way for total incomings, with both sides signing four players on permanent deals. Only seven sides are yet to secure a signing.",
      "Arsenal have offloaded 17 players, while Wolves (13), Burnley and Spurs (both 10) have also trimmed their squads considerably.",
      "Cunha's £62.5m switch to Manchester United is the most expensive deal in the window so far, followed by Tijjani Reijnders (£46.3m), Rayan Ait Nouri (£36m), Jean-Clair Todibo (£35m) and Rayan Cherki (£34m).",
      "In terms of outgoings, Bournemouth cashed in £50m from selling Dean Huijsen to Real Madrid, while Sunderland sold Jobe Bellingham to Borussia Dortmund for £32m and Manchester City sold Yan Couto to Dortmund for £25m.",
      "Meanwhile, Chelsea bolstered their frontline ahead of the Club World Cup with the £30m arrival of Liam Delap from Ipswich.",
      "The 22-year-old is one of three signings along with Mamadou Sarr and Dario Essugo, who have been recruited in time to play in the USA. Estevao Willian will join from Palmeiras after the Club World Cup - and he could face Chelsea at the tournament playing for the Brazilian side.",
      "Arsenal target Benjamin Sesko emerged as a option for Saudi Pro League club Al Hilal, who have been turned down by Bruno Fernandes and Victor Osimhen in the last week, as they scrambled to make a marquee signing in time for the Club World Cup.",
      "However, the RB Leipzig striker's preference to play for a top club in Europe amid talks with Arsenal appeared to stop Al Hilal from taking their interest any further on Deadline Day. They will have to make do with Aleksandar Mitrovic as their striker in the USA.",
      "Sesko will be one of the names to watch for the rest of the summer, with Arsenal seemingly prioritising a move for the 22-year-old ahead of Sporting's Viktor Gyokeres in their hunt for a striker. Adding a left-winger is another priority, with Real Madrid's Rodrygo a top target. At the other end of the pitch, Arsenal are progressing with a deal to sign Chelsea goalkeeper Kepa Arrizabalaga and are expected to trigger the £5m release clause.",
      "The Gunners have taken a backseat in the early running of the window, though, with Premier League champions Liverpool making multiple club-record bids for attacking midfielder Florian Wirtz from Bayer Leverkusen after he turned down Bayern Munich.",
      "Wirtz only wants to move to Anfield but so far the clubs have failed to reach an agreement with Liverpool's latest offer worth £113m - just £2m shy of the British record set by Moises Caicedo's transfer to Chelsea from Brighton in 2023.",
      "The Germany international's keenness on the move has ensured the lengthy negotiations have not created too much anxiety among Liverpool fans, who have lost key player Trent Alexander-Arnold to Real Madrid for £10m and goalkeeper Caoimhin Kelleher to Brentford in an £18m deal.",
      "But Liverpool, who have goalkeeper Giorgi Mamardashvili joining from Valencia, have already signed a right-sided player following Alexander-Arnold's exit with the £29.5m arrival of Jeremie Frimpong, while on the other side, they are eyeing a move for Bournemouth left-back Milos Kerkez.",
      "Initial contact has been made with the Cherries, who have already lined up a replacement in Adrien Truffert from Rennes. Andoni Iraola's side face a potential rebuild this summer, having already lost Dean Huijsen to Real Madrid for £50m, while they have received an approach from Paris Saint-Germain for Illia Zabarnyi.",
      "An offer from Liverpool for Kerkez is the next step in that deal, but how many more incomings there will be at Anfield could depend on the future of Luis Diaz.",
      "The 28-year-old raised doubts about his future when he revealed he was in talks with other clubs while away with Colombia after the Merseyside club rejected an approach from Barcelona.",
      "Diaz is one of two targets Barcelona have for the forward position, along with Marcus Rashford from Manchester United, whose future appears certain to be away from Old Trafford. Interest is expected in the 27-year-old, who will cost £40m this summer.",
      "Manchester United have been unusually quick out of the blocks with their business after signing Matheus Cunha from Wolves for £62.5m - the most expensive signing of the summer so far.",
      "Man Utd are already eyeing their second summer signing with an approach for Brentford forward Bryan Mbeumo, who is keen on the move.",

      "Tuesday 10 June 2025 09:42, UK",
      "United are exploring the conditions of a potential deal for the 27-year-old. Head coach Ruben Amorim is a big admirer of Gyokeres having managed him at Sporting.",
      "Gyokeres has a gentleman's agreement to leave Sporting this summer for offers above £58m (€70m) despite a release clause of around £84m (€100m).",

      "United are in the market for a striker regardless of Rasmus Hojlund's future. Although the Denmark international has said he is not considering leaving the club and will fight for his place next season, United are looking at a number of players in that position.",
      "However, a big focus at United will be on departures too, with offers expected for the likes of Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho, Alejandro Garnacho and Antony.",
      "The preference is to agree to permanent sales for those players, however loan deals cannot be ruled out. There has been plenty of interest - but as yet, no formal offers.",
      "Sporting paid roughly £20m to sign Gyokeres from Coventry in 2023 but they are expected to make a huge profit on his anticipated sale.",
      "The 27-year-old, who scored 40 times in 97 games for Coventry, joining on loan from Brighton initially before making the move permanent in 2021, has hit new heights since his switch to Portugal, smashing 97 goals in 102 games for Sporting, including 11 in 17 in European competition.",

      "He has proved a late bloomer but his rapid rise to prominence in recent seasons has put him on the shortlists of some of the biggest clubs in Europe.",
      "His availability for £58m, considerably less than his Transfermarkt valuation, has made him even more attractive to his suitors, including Manchester United. A reunion with Amorim, the manager who helped bring the best out of him at Sporting, now looks a possibility.",
      "The club are expected to go back in with an improved offer for Brentford forward Bryan Mbeumo after having their first bid rejected, and they remain optimistic a deal can be struck.",
      "There are reports suggesting Thomas Frank will try and tempt Mbeumo to go to Tottenham Hotspur if he takes over as their new head coach, wowever it's understood the player wants to join United.",
      "Man Utd saw their opening bid of £55m rejected. The offer consisted of a guaranteed £45m plus £10m in bonuses.",
      "There is a feeling at Brentford that Mbeumo has earned the chance to move to a bigger club this summer if one meets his valuation.",
      "United have already agreed a deal to sign Matheus Cunha from Wolves for £62.5m.",
      "The transfer is subject to visa and registration, which is expected to be formally completed once the Brazil forward returns from international duty.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo scored 20 goals in the Premier League last season to help Brentford secure a top-half finish - only three players scored more.",
      "He also notched seven assists but should have registered more, clocking a league-topping 9.26 expected assists during the campaign - primarily from delivering a table-topping 202 crosses.",
      "Additionally, only two players covered more distance or attempted more sprints for the season, making him one of the hardest grafters in the league. He also provides serious pace - clocking the fourth-fastest speed at 36.63 km/h.",
      "Factoring in decisive goals or assists that changed the outcomes of games, his 27 goal contributions earned Brentford 22 points - equating to 40 per cent of the Bees' season tally.",

      "Two years after signing him for around £20m from Coventry, Sporting stand to make a huge profit on Viktor Gyokeres.",
      "The 27-year-old, who hit 40 goals in 97 games after joining Coventry from Brighton in 2021, has scaled new heights in Portugal, scoring 97 times in 102 games for Sporting in all competitions since his arrival in 2023 and becoming one of the most coveted strikers in Europe.",
      "Manchester United have made an initial approach over a potential reunion with his former boss Ruben Amorim. Gyokeres is also of interest to Arsenal as the Gunners aim to strengthen their attack.",
      "His scoring exploits for Sporting, which include six goals in eight Champions League appearances last season, have seen him treble in value to £75m in the space of two years, according to the website Transfermarkt, reflecting the speed of his rise to prominence.",
      "Go back further and the contrast is even more stark. Transfermarkt valued him at only £450,000 when he agreed to join Brighton from Swedish club IF Brommapojkarna in late 2017. He was valued at only £830,000 when he turned his loan to Coventry permanent in 2021.",
      "The explosion in his value began after that, as he followed up an 18-goal first season at Coventry with a 22-goal campaign in his second. In the summer of 2023, his Transfermarkt valuation was roughly in line with the £20m fee paid by Sporting.",
      "Two years and 97 goals later, Gyokeres holds added appeal to suitors such as Manchester United given he is thought to be available for considerably less than his current £75m valuation.",
      "Despite having an £84m release clause in his contract, Gyokeres struck a gentleman's agreement with Sporting last year that he would be allowed to leave this summer for offers worth £59m.",
      "A report in Portuguese outlet Record claims Sporting president Federico Varandas has increased the asking price to £68m following enquiries, leaving Gyokeres \"furious\", but even at that price he would represent good value, according to Transfermarkt.",
      "Gyokeres's scoring record speaks for itself and a deeper look at his numbers, compared to those of other strikers across the top seven European leagues, underlines just how good he was last season.",
      "His scoring rate of 1.25 goals per 90 minutes was higher than anyone else's. He also ranked top for touches in the opposition box. He was in the 97th percentile for shots, at 4.46 per 90 minutes.",
      "He ranked in the 98th and 95th percentiles for fast breaks and successful take-ons, underlining his ball-carrying ability, and he also posted impressive numbers creatively.",
      "His average of 1.99 chances created per 90 minutes put him in the 96th percentile among strikers in Europe's top-seven leagues. He ranked in the 84th percentile for assists on 0.22 per 90 minutes.",
      "Gyokeres demonstrated impressive intensity out of possession too, ranking in the 97th percentile for possessions won in the final third, reflecting the effectiveness of his pressing.",
      "There is of course a caveat in that Gyokeres has been competing in a comparatively weak league. According to UEFA coefficient rankings, Portugal's top-flight sits below the Dutch Eredivisie as the seventh strongest in Europe.",
      "Could he replicate his scoring feats in the league which ranks top?",
      "Gyokeres showed his suitability to English football with his impressive spell at Coventry, but the Premier League is a huge step up from the Championship - and from the Portuguese league.",
      "Manchester United must weigh up that unknown as they ponder the pros and cons of a potential move, but they can offer the familiarity of the head coach, in Amorim, who helped bring the best out of him at Sporting, a club who now stand to profit considerably from his sale.",

      "United and Martinez are understood to be satisfied with his rehabilitation since undergoing surgery four months ago and the latest tests carried out last week have confirmed that the 27-year-old has no tear in his meniscus.",

      "Ruben Amorim, the United head coach, had been hugely impressed by Martinez before the injury, suffered in a 2-0 defeat to Crystal Palace at Old Trafford in the Premier League, and views the World Cup winner as a key pillar of his defence moving forward.",
      "Martinez is considered one of the group's leaders internally at Carrington and, in a summer when the club is moving swiftly to bolster a squad that finished 15th in the Premier League, having him back next season will come as a big boost.",

      "The former Ajax defender is one of United's most progressive passers from deep and found more space to step forward and affect the game on the ball when the team shifted to a back three under the Portuguese.",
      "Amorim's approach plays to Martinez's strengths because the onus is on the defenders to build up play while the two No 8s are expected to play further up the pitch in a more box-to-box role rather than dropping deep to collect the ball from the back three.",
      "Across the 20 Premier League games Martinez played last season he was heavily relied on in possession, with the defender attempting and completing a higher volume of passes than any of his team-mates per 90 by some distance.",
      "With Amorim's system putting a greater emphasis on ball retention, there is an expectation he will lean on Martinez in that left centre-back position. His team-mates already do, with captain Bruno Fernandes the only other player taking more touches per 90.",
      "Martinez is not the quickest defender but reads the game well and that is helpful in Amorim's set-up with his defenders required to step up and intercept through balls - with Harry Maguire his only team-mate completing more per 90 in the league.",
