      "The new Premier League season is still some way away, but clubs have been giving their fans plenty to get excited about. For some, that means new signings, but for others the 2025-26 kits are the main talking point.",
      "It has become a habit of some sides to debut new kits at the end of the previous season, while others wait longer. At the time of writing, fewer than half of the 20 teams in England's top tier have shared their new releases, but we'll be updating you throughout the summer as the newest home and away kits drop.",
      "There will often be variety in new kit releases, though this is more likely to come with the change strips than with the home efforts. Traditional colours aren't tampered with quite as regularly - though there are some exceptions.",
      "This time last year, we were starting to see the first of the 2024-25 kits. If you want to refresh your memory, you can look back at our complete ranking of the home and away shirts unveiled by the Premier League's clubs last term.",
      "Those of you who liked last season's efforts might be dreading what's to come, while if you weren't a fan of last year's you might be giving your team a shot at redemption this summer. Without further ado, here are the kits which have been released so far.",
      "Arsenal released their new home kit before the end of the 2024-25 season, allowing their players to wear it for the home Premier League closer against Newcastle. The adidas shirt is red with white shoulders and a red trim, and puts a gothic letter 'A' on the badge at the forefront in a nod to the 1990-91 title winning season.",
      "\"I love our new kit, it looks fresh - I'm excited to wear this in front of our incredible supporters,\" Arsenal and England defender Myles Lewis-Skelly said when the kit was released. \"Their energy lifts us and when we step out in the shirt, we feel it more than ever.\"",
      "Aston Villa's away shirt for the 2024-25 season was all white, but that will change for the upcoming campaign. The new dark away shirt made its first appearance on the final day, when Unai Emery's side lost at Manchester United to miss out on Champions League qualification.",
      "As the club explained, the new design also carries a nod to Villa's home city of Birmingham. \"The design on the shoulders is inspired by the Bullring, one of the iconic landmarks on the skyline of Birmingham and where the club’s new store opens today - meaning both fans and players alike will wear the fabric of our city,\" the club explained along with the release in May.",
      "Chelsea were the first Premier League club to release both their home and away shirts. Both were unveiled before the Blues' Club World Cup campaign, with that competition beginning in mid-June, with the blue home kit carrying a nod to London - and their specific part of the capital.",
      "\"The fabric of London is woven into every thread of our new kit, which is inspired by the capital’s iconic landmarks and creative culture,\" a club release read. \"Chelsea Town Hall is among the architectural landmarks subtly featured on the shirt, which was unveiled by Chelsea and Nike today.\"",
      "We've also now seen Chelsea's new away kit. Players from the men's and women's teams got involved in the launch of the white away shirt with red and green trim - a nod to a 70s design.",
      "\"There is an artistic feel to our new away kit, with the photoshoot taking place at Saatchi Gallery on the King’s Road and the colour palette inspired by a cult classic kit from days gone by,\" the club announced. \"Our manager from the early 1970s, Dave Sexton, introduced an away strip back then which was a tribute to Hungary’s famous ‘Magnificent Magyars’ team from two decades earlier and it evolved into a white shirt with a broad red and green vertical stripe.\"",
      "Manchester City have shown it is possible to keep traditional colours and still get a bit creative. Their 2025-26 home kit will predominantly be sky blue, as usual, but with a white sash.",
      "City also have a sash on their change strip for the Club World Cup, which is predominantly white, in a nod to their 2009-10 away kit. However, this will just be used for the tournament, with City confirming a new away kit will be unveiled ahead of the upcoming league season.",
      "Manchester United won't have a chance to show off their new home kit in Europe, having lost in the final of last season's Europa League. However, they've wasted little time showing off what they will wear next term.",
      "United's new shirt has adidas' famous three stripes in black on the shoulders, while there is also a graphic on the sleeves inspired by the club's Old Trafford Stadium. It's capped off by the words 'Theatre of Dreams' just below the collar on the back.",
      "\"The colour red is fundamental to the club's DNA. There have been many different expressions of it over the years and, for this season, we wanted to do something a little different, using the sleeves as a canvas,\" adidas' Jurgen Rank said. \"The abstract graphic stays true to the club's DNA while providing an innovative look and feel to an otherwise classy and classic jersey.\"",
      "It's black and white again for Newcastle - no surprises there - but with a twist. The classic stripes are blended with a shepherd's check for a slightly different take on the usual colours.",
      "Newcastle debuted the kit at the end of last season against Everton, when they qualified for the Champions League despite losing their home closer. The club has also pledged to donate £5 per shirt sold to the Newcastle United Foundation.",
      "\"It’s a way for supporters to not only wear the badge, and the beautiful new kits with pride, but to directly contribute to the life-changing work the Foundation does across the region,\" chief commercial officer Peter Silverstone said. \"Together, we’re making a difference – on and off the pitch.”",
      "Spurs didn't just appoint a new manager in the first half of June - they also unveiled their new home shirt. The Europa League winners now know what they will be wearing as they look to build under that success under new boss Thomas Frank.",
      "\"The 2025/26 Kit features a subtle tweak to the navy sleeves of last season, with a new grey and ashen slate pattern under the arm and the traditional lilywhite base forming the outer part of the sleeve,\" the club announced when unveiling the new Nike shirt. The kit release was accompanied by a video featuring club legend Ledley King.",
      "Manchester United have launched their new home kit for the 2025/26 season with an Adidas shirt paying tribute to Old Trafford.",
      "Fans can order their Men's, Women's and Kid's shirt today."

After the end of the Premier League campaign, the Red Devils didn't waste time swooping in for the Brazilian, activating his hefty £62.5million release clause from Wolves.",
      "Cunha emerged as a key figure this past season under Vitor Pereira, notching up 15 top-flight goals and six assists, which played a significant part in keeping his side's Premier League hopes alive as they finished in 16th place.",
      "Thursday saw United tie up all loose ends, confirming that the 26-year-old forward has committed to a five-year deal at Old Trafford.",
      "Mount, who formerly starred for Chelsea before swapping flags for United two years ago in a deal worth an initial £55m, then posted a heartwarming welcome to Cunha on Instagram.",
      "The English playmaker uploaded a picture of new signing Cunha penning his deal and captioned it with a heartfelt message: \"Welcome brother!\"",
      "Overcome with joy at his new chapter, Cunha expressed his fulfillment of his lifelong ambition as a youngster in Brazil, and revealed his aim is to help Ruben Amorim's side get back to the top.",
      "\"It is hard to put into words my feelings about becoming a Manchester United player,\" Cunha admitted after his recruitment was made official.",
      "\"Ever since I was a child in Brazil watching Premier League games on TV at my grandmother's house, United was my favourite English team and I dreamed of wearing the red shirt.",

      "The dad of one of Wrexham's star players once landed himself in hot water with Cristiano Ronaldo after his son asked him for a favour. Mick Rathbone, father of Red Dragons midfielder Ollie Rathbone, spent eight years working as a physio at Everton between 2002 and 2010.",
      "The former Blackburn Rovers and Birmingham City defender would often bring his football-mad son to work, where Toffees favourites like Wayne Rooney and Duncan Ferguson kindly took him under their wing. However, it was one of their opponents who Ollie was most starstruck by as a youngster - Manchester United legend Ronaldo.",
      "Mick revealed how it led to a very awkward encounter with the Portuguese forward in a corridor after a match between Everton and United. The incident, which left Ronaldo distinctly unimpressed, occurred after Ollie tasked his dad with getting his shirt signed by his idol.",
      "Recounting the episode in his book, The Smell of Football, Mick said: \"Sometimes, I must admit, when surrounded by these superstars, I just wanted to grab a pen and piece of paper and get their autographs, but this was frowned upon as being totally uncool.",
      "\"A few years ago, however, when we played United, Ollie begged me to get Cristiano Ronaldo's autograph on his brand new Portugal shirt that he had just received for his birthday. I really didn’t like to ask and did feel a bit of an anorak, but you know what it's like - you will do anything for your kids, won't you?",
      "\"I kept my eyes open after the game to try and catch sight of Ronaldo passing the medical room. Eventually, I saw him and stepped into the busy passageway, clutching the shirt. I was in my full Everton regalia, so I didn't feel too much of an intruder.",
      "\"'Excuse me, Cristiano, could you please sign this for my son?' He didn't look too pleased, but grabbed the shirt and the pen without looking up or acknowledging my existence, and started scribbling. 'Can you write, 'To Oliver, happy birthday' on it please Cristiano?' He still didn't look up but just kept scribbling.",
      "\"'It’s O-L-I-V…' I didn't get any further. He just threw the shirt back in my face where, due to the phenomenon that is static electricity, it stuck. He then walked away, leaving me with the shirt on my head.\"",
      "Mick added: \"There were a couple of the Everton press guys in the corridor that day who saw it all, and we absolutely p***ed ourselves laughing for the next 10 minutes. Never again.\"",
      "Ollie got a taste of life at United for himself as a youngster after coming up through the club's academy at the same time as the likes of Marcus Rashford. The 28-year-old spent eight years with the Red Devils before joining Rochdale in 2016 due to a lack of first-team opportunities.",
      "He later signed for Rotherham, where he enjoyed a three-year stint, until moving to Wrexham for £500,000 last summer. Ollie impressed in his first campaign with the club owned by Hollywood stars Ryan Reynolds and Rob McElhenney, helping Phil Parkinson's side to achieve promotion from League One.",
      "He was also named as the club's player of the season after scoring eight goals in 41 league games. Mick has expressed his delight at Ollie's achievements at Wrexham after aiding them in reaching the Championship for the first time in 43 years.",
      "Welcome to Wrexham is back on Disney+ for a fourth season. Fans can watch the series with a £4.99 monthly plan, or get 12 months for the price of 10 by paying for a year upfront.",
      "\"I'm proud of Ollie; all the family are, but I'd be just as proud of him if he served me a coffee,\" Mick told The Leader after becoming a regular at the Racecourse Ground this season. \"We love the atmosphere at home games and Ollie's enjoyed it at Wrexham; he says it's a fantastic club.",
      "\"He got a knock on the ankle early on in the season and had to work hard to get into the side, but once he did you knew he was going to give his all to remain there. He's consistent, got a great work-rate and he'll give you everything - and fans appreciate that.",
      "\"Supporters pay their hard-earned cash and if they see players giving it their all, they'll like you. I was a bit like that in my playing days at Blackburn as giving 100 per cent every game is the minimum requirement for a footballer, whether you're playing for Barcelona or the Dog and Duck.\"",

      "Manchester United should sign Victor Osimhen this summer instead of Viktor Gyokeres. That's according to Rio Ferdinand, who reckons the Nigerian striker is a better fit for his former club. The Red Devils struggled for firepower this season, with Rasmus Hojlund finding the net just four times in the Premier League.",
      "Last summer's marquee signing Joshua Zirkzee has also failed to impress at Old Trafford, with just three league goals in 32 games. With just 44 goals registered as a team - the second lowest amount in the Premier League outside of a relegated Southampton, Ipswich and Leicester - it is clear that United need to bring a talisman to the north west in the coming months.",
      "And Ruben Amorim is eager to welcome fresh faces to overhaul his inherited squad. United have already struck a £62.5million deal with Wolves for Matheus Cunha, and are trying to work out terms with Brentford for Bryan Mbeumo.",
      "Another name linked with the Red Devils is Sporting CP sensation Gyokeres, who scored 39 goals and provided eight assists to help his side clinch the Primeira Liga title this season. However, Ferdinand believes Napoli's Osimhen is a better option, given he has far more experience than the 27-year-old Swede.",
      "\"So, I think you need someone in all the good teams you see. They normally have at least one of the attacking players, normally the number nine. And you go, actually, yeah, I can pin my hat on him. I can rely on him.",
      "\"And I think Hojlund's lack of experience has been a big factor. So, a striker, I don't want any striker. I think I've said it on my podcast many times. I think a striker with experience, knows his right way around the football field, who the young ones they've invested in, like Hojlund and Zirkzee and Chido [Obi] can learn from.\"",
      "On Gyokeres, he added: \"I think Gyokeres, everyone's talking about him. Again, I think if I'm looking at the market now and I had to pick him or Osimhen, I'd probably pick Osimhen because of that experience.",
      "\"And he's shown he's done it in multiple leagues now. And he's done it internationally as well. I think he's a top-class number nine who, again, the young players will be able to learn from. I'm not saying that Gyokeres would fail. I'm just saying that if I had a preference, I would go there.\"",
      "If United are to sign Gyokeres, they will have to beat Arsenal to the punch, with Mikel Arteta also linked with the star striker in a bid to bolster his own strike force for 2025/26.",
      "Gyokeres's contract has a reported £85m release clause, so the Red Devils could be forced to pay in excess for his services, given that he is contracted with Sporting until 2028. Club president Frederico Varandas also recently announced that interested parties will have to part ways with more than his £59m price tag.",
      "Osimhen, meanwhile, is unsettled at Napoli, but the club will still want big money to part ways with him this summer. A £63m deal with Al-Hilal was reportedly accepted by the Serie A giants recently, only for the 26-year-old to decide against a move to the Middle East.",
      "However, with Liverpool, Chelsea and Juventus all thought to be interested in the striker, Manchester United will again face stiff competition for his signature.",
      "Ferdinand's comments come as he launches his Career Transfer Hub with Talking Futures, with hopes of connecting teenagers and parents in planning their futures. Speaking about the cause, he said: \"I think it's about empowering kind of families to talk more about education, especially parents.",
      "\"I think we're comfortable talking about a lot of things, i.e. football, a lot of the time in and around the front room or across the table with your kids, but getting that kind of common ground when you're talking about education, sometimes it's quite difficult, even I've found it difficult at times.",
      "\"So something like this is definitely a good way in and a good avenue in to kind of having those conversations about what's next in your life, education wise, where do you see yourself going? What paths are you looking at?",
      "\"And this is a great, I think, avenue for parents to really kind of touch the paper and go, right, listen, here we go, and start walking their kids down the right path, giving them a little bit of autonomy over it, but also guide them a little bit at the same time. So I wish I'd had this when I was younger - although I had football, which I was quite fortunate with.\"",
      "Rio Ferdinand has partnered with Talking Futures to launch the Career Transfer Hub – giving parents access to information on their child’s education options just like football agents have transfer insiders, negotiation teams and career scouts. You can find out more here.",

      "Cleverley meanwhile is out of a job having been sacked by Watford last month. He had led the Hornets to a 14th-place finish in the second tier in his first full season.",
      "Plymouth had spoken to four candidates about their vacancy with Cleverley emerging as the frontrunner. Former Arsenal star Jack Wilshere, who had been caretaker boss at Norwich, was also interviewed but looks set to miss out according to the Guardian.",

      "The Pilgrims knew their relegation was all but confirmed ahead of the final day with a hugely inferior goal difference meaning they were ultimately down. They were beaten by Leeds at Home Park which bought an end to their two-year stay in the Championship.",
      "Their demise began with Wayne Rooney at the helm. Cleverley's former team-mate at Old Trafford was handed another managerial gig in the Championship but struggled for results. He won five of his 25 games before he was shown the door just after Christmas.",
      "He left Plymouth sitting in the relegation zone and, despite an upturn in form that saw them down the likes of Sheffield United, they couldn't save themselves and will hope to bounce back at the first time of asking. They are among the pre-season favourites for promotion.",
      "Rooney has said on his stint: \"I loved my time there - I think the fans were great, the staff were great. We just hit a bad run of form and the players actually you know I can't fault them, they were trying everything. Maybe we just lacked that bit of quality.\"",
      "Rooney's successor, Muslic, appeared to take a swipe at the Evertonian and claimed that the club would never have gone down had he been in charge all season. \"I think if I'm the head coach from day one we will be far, far away from the relegation zone,\" he said previously.",

      "During his time at United, he clinched two Premier League titles, the Champions League, and a League Cup under Sir Alex Ferguson's stewardship, bagging 42 goals across 124 matches over four years. Injuries, however, saw Saha fall out of favour, prompting his move from Old Trafford to Everton in 2008.",
      "Despite ongoing fitness battles, he still managed to score a commendable 35 goals in 115 games for the Toffees from 2008 to 2012. Saha's relationship with Everton's medical staff was notably positive, especially with ex-club physio Mick Rathbone.",
      "Rathbone, once dubbed the 'best signing ever' by David Moyes, recounted a touching story about Saha's generous act after signing a new contract deal at Goodison Park in 2010.",
      "\"We were excited about working with Louis despite his injury-prone reputation,\" the former Preston medic wrote in his book, The Smell of Football. \"In his first season at the club, we were extremely careful with him, in terms of not pushing him too hard.",
      "\"We quickly gained his trust because he intimated that at all his previous clubs, he felt this had not necessarily been the case. By his second season we had developed a relationship that allowed us to push him harder.",
      "\"In those two seasons, Louis played nearly 70 games and scored more than 20 goals for Everton, despite being injured and out for six weeks when he first came to us from Manchester United.\"",
      "Rathbone added: \"When Louis signed his new contract in February 2010, Bill Ellaby, the player liaison officer, handed me an envelope. He explained it was a thank you from Louis. I was touched he had taken the trouble to thank me in writing. I opened the envelope thinking, 'F*** me, this is a thick letter.'\".",
      "\"But it wasn't a letter; it was an envelope stuffed with £50 notes. That is the type of gratitude I prefer. After all, let's face it, talk is cheap. Apparently, he rewarded every member of the medical staff in the same way. I think he respected us for the care and time we gave him. It was a magnificent gesture from a great guy.\"",
      "Saha may no longer be on the football pitch, but he's certainly not short of cash these days, with a net worth that dwarfs even that of Cristiano Ronaldo, his ex-teammate at United. Since retiring in 2013 at 35, the former France international has dived into the business world with impressive results.",
      "His enterprise 'AxisStars', co-founded with Kate Hamer, is now said to be valued at an eye-watering £4.3billion. The firm seeks to forge links between 'professional athletes and entertainers, their peers and trusted partners'.",

      "Viktor Gyokeres is not the first Sporting Lisbon player to be at the centre of a huge transfer saga. Gyokeres, 27, reportedly wants to leave the club this summer and is linked to a handful of Premier League sides.",
      "Recent reports have claimed the ex-Coventry City forward has threatened to go on strike to force an exit. Arsenal and Manchester United have both been heavily linked, but it appears either club will have a hard time bartering with the Portuguese champions, who are demanding £67million, despite Gyokeres reportedly being of the impression that he could depart for as little as £60m.",
      "Six years ago, Gyokeres' potential future team-mate Bruno Fernandes - who was at Sporting at the time - was of interest to United and Tottenham, but the club were reluctant to sell. Eventually, United signed him at the end of the 2020 January transfer window in a £67.8m deal.",
      "Before the Red Devils secured his signature, Ronaldo made a six-word remark where he appeared to tell Fernandes to do everything he could to leave the Jose Alvalade Stadium. Speaking to Portuguese television station TVi, Ronaldo said: \"Nobody knows why he (Fernandes) doesn't leave.\"",
      "The ex-United forward also said he had spoken to Fernandes and urged him to do everything he could to fulfil his potential, suggesting the midfielder has to leave Sporting to get to the top of his game. He added: \"Possibly this new generation will be the best at the talent level.",
      "\"But that's not enough. They have to want to. I have spoken to him [Fernandes]. I'm a captain who wants to help and be helped.”",
      "Gyokeres is no international team-mate of Ronaldo's but he can certainly relate to what the now Al-Nassr forward said to Fernandes. Ronaldo also left Sporting to join United in a £12.2m move all the way back in 2003.",
      "While Sir Alex Ferguson said United had a positive relationship with Sporting, the Scot also admitted the deal took, \"some time\" to get over the line. United failed in signing Fernandes in the 2019 summer transfer market and were close to missing out on him again the following January, but managed to secure a deal with one day left of the window.",
      "If United are to sign Gyokeres this year, they could be made to wait in similar fashion. Portuguese outlet Record understands Gyokeres was under the impression that he and the club had agreed a gentleman's agreement, which would allow him to leave if a bid of £50m plus £8.4m in add-ons was made.",
      "However, Sporting president Frederico Varandas recently denied the existence of this agreement. The Lisbon chief said: \"I can guarantee that Viktor Gyokeres will not leave for 60m euros plus 10m euros because I never promised that. To this day Sporting has not had an offer for Gyokeres - neither today nor last season.\"",
      "Lisbon are now understood to be after £67m from potential suitors. Gyokeres has scored a barnstorming 97 goals in 102 appearances since his £20m move from Coventry City in 2023. CNN Portugal recently claimed Gyokeres' agent Hasan Cetinkaya has met with Arsenal's owners.",
      "It's also understood that the north Londoners sent a delegation to Lisbon last month to discuss a move for the striker. Talks are described as being \"very advanced\" between the two sides.",
      "However, Arsenal have also been linked with a move for RB Leipzig forward Benjamin Sesko. The young Slovenian has been on their radar for a long time, but the Daily Mail understands the Bundesliga giants are demanding at least £75m for his services.",

      "Manchester United have completed the £62.5million signing of Matheus Cunha from Wolves. The 26 year-old Brazilian international forward has signed a contract until June 2030, with the option of an additional year.",
      "Brazil forward Cunha, United’s first signing of the summer window, said: “It is hard to put into words my feelings about becoming a Manchester United player. Ever since I was a child in Brazil watching Premier League games on TV at my grandmother’s house, United was my favourite English team and I dreamed of wearing the red shirt.",
      "“I want to thank my family and everyone who has helped me make that dream a reality. I can’t wait for the start of pre-season to get to know my teammates and prepare for the season ahead.",
      "“All my focus is now on working hard to become a valuable part of the team, and helping get this club back to the top.”  Jason Wilcox, United’s Director of Football, said: “Bringing in Matheus was one of our main priorities for this summer, so we are delighted to have completed his signing so early in the window.",
      "“He has proved his ability to succeed in the Premier League as one of the most exciting and productive forwards in England during his time at Wolves, and before that in Spain and Germany.",
      "“He has all the qualities we are looking for as we seek to build a strong, dynamic and entertaining team capable of challenging for the biggest honours.”",
      "The deal had been announced initially by both United and former club Wolves on June 1. In a short club statement, Wolves declared: \"Everyone at Wolves would like to thank Matheus for his contributions in old gold and wish he and his family the best of luck for the future.\"",
      "Manchester United have launched their new home kit for the 2025/26 season with an Adidas shirt paying tribute to Old Trafford.",
      "Fans can order their Men's, Women's and Kid's shirt today.",
      "United prioritised a move for Cunha this summer after his exploits for Wolves in 2024-25 and their own failings in front of goal. United were the Premier League's fifth lowest scorers, while the Brazilian scored 17 goals and added six assists as he earned Wolves' Players' Player of the Season award.",
      "His flexibility also appealed, with head coach Ruben Amorim penciling in a role for Cunha as one of his two No.10s in the Portuguese's preferred 3-4-2-1 formation. Brentford's Bryan Mbeumo is the top target for the other role, while United are still pushing for a new No.9 also.",
      "Cunha only signed a new contract at Molineux in February, having failed to land a big-money move in January. His new deal contained the £62.5m release clause which United have agreed to pay, but only after attempting to persuade Wolves to allow them to meet the terms of the clause over a longer period.",
      "Instead, Wolves refused to budge, and United quickly agreed to pay the full amount as per the terms in his contract with the Black Country side, meaning Wolves will see £20.83m up front, another £20.83m at the end of the 2025-26 season, and the remaining £20.83m at the end of the 2026-27 campaign."

The sell-on clause was said to be worth 10 per cent of any profit on the initial fee Sporting paid to originally sign the player.",
      "However, the Coventry Telegraph reported last summer that the fee was actually reduced by just five percent after Sporting paid the Championship side €1m (£843,500), in addition to the player hitting “certain objectives” over the course of the season.",
      "Initially, Coventry stood to gain 15% of any profit on the initial fee paid by Sporting if Gyokeres was sold on. This percentage was subject to change based on the player's performance, including goals, appearances and club honours, which were add-ons to the initial fee, and amount to €2m (almost £1.7m).",

      "Mason Greenwood will play alongside former Manchester United team-mate Angel Gomes next season at Marseille. They will reunite in France five years after Gomes left the Red Devils, having once been left humiliated by former United manager Jose Mourinho.",
      "Marseille confirmed this week that they have reached an agreement in principle to sign England international Gomes. The Ligue 1 runners-up, managed by Roberto De Zerbi, beat a host of clubs to his signature, with the 24-year-old reportedly signing a three-year deal at the Orange Velodrome.",
      "RMC Sport previously reported that the United academy graduate was convinced by De Zerbi's style of play and the opportunity to compete in the Champions League. Gomes had announced he would be leaving Lille once his contract expired this summer.",
      "The midfielder made the move to Lille at the end of his United contract in the summer of 2020, having been tipped for great things at Old Trafford after signing for the club back in 2006. The England U21s European Championship winner was handed his debut aged just 16 by Mourinho on the final day of the 2016/17 season, making him United's youngest ever Premier League player.",
      "But despite the trust placed in him by the current Fenerbahce boss, a 17-year-old Gomes was once brought to the brink of tears as a result of Mourinho criticising his performance in a reserve team match in front of the first team.",
      "He told the Athletic: \"I played a game for the reserves and he watched — he didn’t think I played good enough. Two days later, the first team had a game, and he took me with the team. At the pre-match, in front of everybody, he let me know about it.\"",
      "Expanding on the story in an interview with The Times, Gomes explained: \"At the time I was thinking, 'Why has he done that in front of everyone? Could he not have pulled me to the side?'",
      "\"A few of the players came up to me and said, 'He just wants a reaction from you, don't let it faze you', but in that moment, I didn't want to hear anything.",
      "'I rushed to my room and rang my dad and my brother. There's not much they could say to me really. I was almost crying. I was really young.",
      "\"It wasn't until I was older that I realised, with Mourinho, he's always looking at ways to get more out of you. I think him doing that in front of everyone showed he valued me as a player. I probably needed it.\"",
      "He added: \"It's all mental toughness. What I came to learn about Jose is he always wants you to do better. He is almost like prodding you, 'Come on, show me a bit more. Everyone's told me how good you are, but I want to see it.'\"",
      "Despite the psychological blow at the time, Gomes wishes he had been mature enough to embrace Mourinho's management style, saying: \"It wasn't until I left and I see Jose winning trophies that I think, 'Ah, I understand you. And if only I had understood you more, I would have been able to appreciate my time more with you'. But no, in the midst of little b*********s, [he was] an amazing guy.\"",
      "Gomes' departure came during Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's tenure, following Mourinho's sacking two years prior in 2018. His game time was extremely limited under Solskjaer while the then-promising Greenwood was enjoying his first-team breakthrough in the 2019/20 season.",
      "After playing a total of 320 minutes for United, Gomes left as a free agent, capping off the \"most difficult period\" of his career. Despite spending the first year of his five-year Lille stint at Portuguese club Boavista, the move to Ligue 1 served to kickstart his career. He made 134 appearances in all competitions for Lille, including 20 this season as they finished fifth in the league.",
      "He also impressed in a Three Lions shirt last year after receiving his first four caps under interim boss Lee Carsley. However, Gomes has not yet featured under new manager Thomas Tuchel.",

      "And with his career at a standstill it was Dortmund who gave him a platform to play again during the second half of the 2023-24 campaign, where he helped his old club reach the final of the Champions League.",

      "Aston Villa, Tottenham and Newcastle are all said to be keeping an eye on Sancho's situation with a permanent exit from Old Trafford likely in the coming weeks. Villa took Sancho's United team-mate, Marcus Rashford, on loan for the second half of last season but a permanent deal does not appear to be on the cards, hence their interest in Sancho.",

The Danish international has eight goals for his country, but only one of those has arrived since the end of 2023, and there's now a feeling he's no longer an automatic starter.",
      "Hojlund scored just five Premier League goals at club level last season, though his Europa League exploits allowed him to reach double figures in all competitions. He started the first game in Denmark's friendly double-header, drawing a blank against Northern Ireland, and dropped to the bench for the meeting with Lithuania on Tuesday.",
      "One man who has found goals much easier to come by at club level is compatriot Mika Biereth. The former Arsenal youngster hit the ground running for Monaco after joining in January, and made his senior international bow against Portugal in March.",
      "It was Biereth, not Hojlund, who partnered Kasper Dolberg up front in the Lithuania friendly. The 22-year-old wasted little time finding the net for the first time at senior international level, scoring the first of five Danish goals, and came in for praise post-match as compatriot Hojlund got a reminder of the challenge ahead.",

      "\"Try to think about how many times we have sat with a Danish national team and said: 'We are missing players, when will some strikers come?',\" Riemer told Viaplay (via Tipsbladet). \"We have so many young players, some of them may be just young enough to break through, but how great is it that we have so many knocking on the door – I think that is important to say.\"",

      "Gyokeres starred for Sporting over the past two campaigns, and scored twice as many goals as any other player in last season's Primeira Liga. He is one of two men high on Arsenal's shipping list, along with RB Leipzig's Benjamin Sesko, as Mikel Arteta's team chases an elusive title after three successive runner-up finishes.",
      "Arsenal can offer the former Coventry City hotshot a chance to play for a Champions League contender, with Arteta having led his team to the semi-finals last season. Premier League rivals United can't match that, but they could yet tempt Gyokeres with a reunion with former Sporting boss Ruben Amorim in Manchester.",
      "Now, according to Portuguese outlet Record, Gyokeres' representative Hasan Cetinkaya has met with Arsenal's owners. The publication describes the meeting as the start of a \"new phase\" in negotiations and anticipates a formal proposal.",
      "The same outlet makes reference to comments from Sporting president Frederico Varandas that - as of Wednesday morning - a formal offer from Arsenal had yet to arrive. It also points to reports elsewhere on the continent that United remain keen on a deal and have remained in contact with representatives for Gyokeres.",
      "Gyokeres has a significant release clause in his contract, but suitors might not need to meet it despite his impressive return of 54 goals in 52 games this season. Back in April, it was claimed that around £60million should be enough to land the Scandinavian.",
      "That number comes down to a reported agreement between the player and his current club. Gyokeres is even said to be prepared to go on strike to force through a move, amid reports Sporting are keen to hold out for £67m.",
      "The 27-year-old frontman is also the subject of interest from the Saudi Pro League, but is believed to favour Champions League football with Arsenal. He scored six times in eight appearances in the competition in the 2024-25 season, including a hat-trick in a famous win for Sporting against Manchester City.",

      "Things have seemingly taken a sour turn in Lisbon very quickly after it emerged Gyokeres was not happy with Sporting, where he has become an icon in two seasons. It's alleged the Sweden striker was under the impression a 'gentleman's agreement' would allow him to leave for around £59million this summer.",
      "But after scoring 97 times in 102 appearances for the Lions, it seems Sporting are intent on receiving the full value of his £85m release clause if he's to leave. And it's led to claims Gyokeres will go on strike if needed in order to force through a dream move this summer.",
      "CNN Portugal reported Cetinkaya met with Arsenal's owners on Wednesday in an effort to expedite a deal. The Gunners reportedly sent a delegation to Lisbon last month to discuss a potential move for Sporting's prolific frontman.",
      "The update suggests talks between the two parties are \"very advanced.\" And although Arsenal's representatives have met with Sporting in the past, it's understood matters are now looking more formal ahead of a potential deal being struck.",
      "It's also suggested that a move to the Emirates Stadium has been Gyokeres' preference \"from the very beginning.\" And it could mean United boss Ruben Amorim, the man who brought him to Portugal from Coventry City, is left out in the cold.",
      "Gyokeres' inner circle have already made it clear they want him to remain in Lisbon. The player's uncle, Chris, revealed at the Taca de Portugal final, where Gyokeres forced extra time before lifting the title, that the family encouraged their star to stick in his current surroundings.",
      "When asked if the family felt a connection to Lisbon, he told Sport.TV: \"Yes, very much. Yesterday at dinner, we decided that he has to stay.\"",
      "Not only that, but Gyokeres' girlfriend, Ines Aguiar, has also campaigned for him to stick around. According to A Bola, she \"promised\" to do her utmost to convince him to commit to a third season with Sporting despite the swell of transfer interest.",
      "Gyokeres recently ruled out a return to his home nation and told Swedish Vogue: \"After living in a warm country, it would be difficult. In Sweden, people work hard during the week and only socialize on the weekends. Here there is more life during the week. They have dinners with friends, a glass of wine on Monday. I like that.\"",
      "Mikel Arteta's side may have left United in their wake after seemingly moving ahead in discussions. Arsenal appear to be intent on making up for last year's shortcomings by signing an elite striker this summer.",
      "Injuries to Kai Havertz and Gabriel Jesus left the club short last season despite calls to add to their forward department. And it left new signing Mikel Merino with the responsibility of leading the line for much of this season.",
      "The Spaniard did well in his makeshift role and scored 10 goals between January and May. However, the Gunners are under no illusion that a more natural talent is required up top, and the benefit of offering Champions League football is a major advantage over United.",
      "The same can be said for United after a record-low finish of 15th in the Premier League. The likes of Rasmus Hojlund and Joshua Zirkzee have failed to set the world alight as hoped at Old Trafford, with Amorim now seeking to make his own mark on the squad.",
      "Gyokeres, 27, isn't the only forward target believed to be on Arsenal's radar. The club has been closely linked with RB Leipzig's Benjamin Sesko this summer, with the club's hierarchy seemingly keen on the Slovenia international.",
      "However, recent developments would suggest Gyokeres remains the preferred pick if the Gunners get their way. And it may mean United are left devastated as a direct rival hoovers up one of the most coveted talents on the market."

      "Cunha received interest from other Premier League sides, but the Brazilian only entertained a move to Old Trafford. It still means something to play for United, which can be forgotten particularly after a nightmare season.",

      "Nevertheless, discussions between United and the Bees have remained ongoing and the Old Trafford outfit are confident of making a breakthrough in negotiations in order to make Mbeumo their second signing of the summer. United would like to get the deal wrapped up in time for the former Troyes man to report to Carrington for pre-season training at the start of July.",

      "Fortunately, United have a crop of players they are actively looking to sell this summer, and a handful of them are big-name players, meaning they could be recipient of some handsome fees.",
      "United's success rate in the seller's market has gradually improved under Ineos, but there is still a long way to go in their attempts to master the art of two-way recruitment.",
      "United have identified Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho and Antony as priority sales after spending time out on loan in 2024/25. None of them feature in Ruben Amorim's plans and the club has no plans to reintegrate them into the squad this summer.",
      "It is understood United value Rashford at £40m and Antony, who has created a market for himself after impressing on loan at Real Betis in the second half of the season, should be available for £32.5m.",
      "United would have banked up to £25m from Chelsea for Sancho had they not backed out of their obligation to sign him permanently. It is expected that he will be available for somewhere in the region of £20m.",
      "If United successfully offload those three at the aforementioned valuations, they will bank £92.5m, and that figure could go a long way towards funding the addition of a striker, which remains a top priority.",
      "Although Rashford, Sancho and Antony have been identified as priority sales to bring in funds, Alejandro Garnacho is another player increasingly likely to move on. He has been informed he will be allowed to leave Old Trafford if the club receives an acceptable offer.",
      "Napoli saw a £40m bid turned down for the Argentine back in January after it failed to meet United's valuation. Garnacho is a player with enormous potential and should be valued at a base price of £50m.",
      "The prospect of adding that figure or more to the kitty would go a long way towards helping United achieve their ambitions this summer.",
      "They have made an excellent start to the off-season by signing Cunha and putting the wheels in motion in an attempt to sign Mbeumo, but they need more than just two attackers. Without overseeing a crop of high-profile sales, however, they will be unable to do an awful lot more."

      "Speaking after the 2-0 victory against Aston Villa, Amorim told MUTV: “I think once again Jason Wilcox is doing a great job bringing Ayden. I think these types of players are what we need.",
      "\"He showed a lot of quality and character after the big injury. We want these types of players.”",
      "Heaven delivered another assured performance against Villa to end a positive debut season at the club, which suggested United secured a bargain when they signed him for around £1million.",

      "Arsenal did what they could to keep Heaven, although they now may wish they had done a little bit more. Left-footed centre-backs are worth their weight in gold in modern football and Heaven has made a really pleasing start to life at Old Trafford, looking confident and composed at the back.",

      "Obi has been prolific in academy fixtures throughout his teenage years and he is an outstanding prospect for the future. The 17-year-old was signed from Arsenal's academy for a small compensation fee and his transfer to United was described by a source as a \"significant coup\" last summer.",
      "United have signed Heaven and Obi from Arsenal for a pittance and both of those players could become important first-team regulars, so the club deserve praise for arranging their arrivals.",
      "The transfer of Obi seemed to particularly annoy Arsenal supporters, but he is only at the beginning of his career, and those fans will be irked again if he reaches the heights that are expected.",
      "United have taken flak for their abysmal transfer record in the post-Sir Alex Ferguson era, but perhaps the tide is turning and signings like Heaven and Obi are the blueprint for a successful future."

      "United triggered to £62.5million release clause in Cunha's contract at Wolves, which will be paid over three instalments, and a similar fee will be needed to persuade Brentford to allow Mbeumo to leave.",
      "Ruben Amorim does not have a warchest to play with, but Cunha and Mbuemo would take the summer spending to more than £120m and player sales will be important to offset incomings.",
      "It's no secret that United need to sell players this summer and, conveniently, there are three players who have decent resale value at the front of the queue to exit Old Trafford.",
      "The first of those is Marcus Rashford, who will be available for £40m. Rashford missed the end of the season at Aston Villa with a hamstring injury, but he showed enough during his temporary stint at Villa Park for a club to take a chance on him - Barcelona have been heavily linked - this summer.",
      "Rashford's sale will be considered as pure profit in the books. His departure will be key for the transfer budget, although shifting Antony and Jadon Sancho is also high on the agenda.",
      "Sancho will not be joining Chelsea on a permanent transfer, which means the Blues will now pay a £5m penalty charge to United to break the agreement they signed last summer.",
      "It's unprecedented for a club to pay £5m to break their obligation agreement and the ordeal is embarrassing for Sancho, whose career has sadly nosedived over the last few years.",
      "It also means a new buyer must come to the table for Sancho. There have been murmurs of interest from Turkey and United will hope they can bank £20m minimum for the winger.",
      "Antony could be remembered as the worst Premier League signing ever, but he was tremendous during his Real Betis loan and the Spanish club would like to sign him permanently.",
      "The Brazilian must be sold for £32.5m to avoid a PSR loss on his transfer from Ajax, but that would make him Real Betis' record transfer and they probably don't have that capital to spend.",
      "Again, that means United need to find a new willing buyer for Antony this summer, but his stock has improved due to his hugely successful loan stint and £32.5m feels like a fair valuation.",
      "The fourth sale up Amorim's sleeve is Alejandro Garnacho, who was informed he could find a new club this summer after a private breakdown with United's coach at the end of the campaign.",
      "Napoli and Chelsea were interested in signing Garnacho in the January transfer window. The fee of £40m was talked up, but United should be holding out for at least £50m for Garnacho.",
      "Garnacho has proven himself in the Premier League, he is an Argentine international and has not reached his ceiling. He is worth £50m because of the untapped potential he possesses.",
      "Amorim was asked if Garnacho had played his final game for the club after the win over Aston Villa and said: \"Garnacho is one more player of Manchester United, so I don't know what is going to happen in the future. He is a normal player.\"",
      "United's head coach added: \"Garnacho is a Manchester United player who was not in the squad today, but he is a normal player in our club and I have no news that will change [that].\"",
      "Amorim has handled Garnacho intelligently in public to protect his transfer value, giving him minutes on the post-season tour, but the 20-year-old is expected to have played his final game for the club. The combined sales of that quartet would total 142.5m."

      "Whereas his goal against Japan was as a result of putting pressure on the goalkeeper and forcing him into a mistake, his strike against Congo was a low drive from outside the penalty area that crept into the bottom corner.",

      "He told The Times: \"Since Sir Alex left they were underperforming. They haven't won the title since he left. At any club, if you cannot get the right players, then you should at least not sign the wrong ones.",
      "\"You are in trouble if you do that in one or two or three consecutive transfer windows. Club building is about building the right squad by transferring the right players away and having more than 50 per cent success rate of bringing in the right players.",
      "\"Then you must have the best possible coaches to develop these players.\"",
      "Once Rangnick had got his feet under the table at Old Trafford in November 2021 after being installed as interim manager, he was able to analyse United's problems up close. His press conferences were more memorable than the football.",
      "\"You don't even need glasses to see and analyse where the problems are,\" he said in April 2022. \"Now it's about how do we solve them?",
      "\"It's not enough to do some minor amendments – cosmetic things. In medicine you would say that this is an operation of the open heart.",
      "\"If this happens and everyone has realised that this has to happen and if people want to work together then it makes sense and I believe it doesn't take two or three years to change those things. This can happen within one year.\"",
      "United's recruitment strategy over the past decade has attracted plenty of criticism. They have paid over the odds for countless players and have often allowed players to run down their contracts and leave for free when they could have been sold for a fee. Jesse Lingard is a prime example of that particular failing.",
      "However, after Ineos secured a minority stake at the start of 2024, United's recruitment strategy has improved. They were proactive in the seller's market last summer, cashing in on players who did not have long-term futures at the club.",
      "Most of those who left were sold in deals that included sell-on clauses or buy-back clauses. It represented a step in the right direction after years of mismanagement and misunderstanding of the market.",
      "For all of Ineos' faults, United's recruitment policy has improved under their stewardship. They are looking to offload a number of big-name players this summer.",

      "With United now operating with a winger-less system, there is no sense in retaining players who do not fit head coach Ruben Amorim's formation. In the past, you would have been unable to guarantee United would be so sensible.",
      "Showing ambition to get the aforementioned trio off the books, United are in the process of moulding the squad to Amorim's needs. He has already been allowed to sign a specialist operator for his system in Matheus Cunha and he now wants to sign Brentford star Bryan Mbeumo.",
      "In those two, should Mbeumo sign, United will have secured the services of ready-made Premier League players. In the past, their recruitment has not been anywhere near as sensible.",
      "In offloading players at the right juncture, they are freeing up space and generating funds to modernise the squad and evolve it. There comes a certain point where clubs have to oversee major rebuilds and United have been in need of one for years.",
      "This summer, however, feels as though it will come to fruition. They have started the window on the front foot and every decision they have made so far has been positive.",
      "In offloading players at the right time, United are giving themselves the best possible chance of bringing the right ones in. They may be halfway towards proving Rangnick's assessment right."

He was the best striker outside of the Premier League in England that season, with his variety of goals, running power, strength, ball striking ability and clever in-box movement clear for all to see.",
      "However, nobody could have prepared themselves for what he has done at Sporting over the last two seasons. His tally of 54 goals in 2024/25 means he has scored 97 goals in just 102 games.",
      "For all the talk about him playing in the Portuguese top flight, or his first touch sometimes being a little bit heavy, Gyokeres should be accepted for what he is: a goalscorer. And what is it Manchester United need this summer? A goalscorer.",
      "Football is a game of opinions, meaning it is understandable why some United fans are hoping the club will sign Gyokeres and others are in favour of Victor Osimhen.",

      "Osimhen's wage demands could be a big stumbling block for United. He has reportedly set huge demands this summer amid the likelihood of an exit from Napoli and that could force the Reds to look elsewhere.",
      "If that is the case, they would not find a better alternative than Gyokeres, who is currently one of the most sought-after strikers in the world after another stellar season in Portugal.",
      "One of his biggest strengths is his ability to score all different types of goals. He is always alert inside the box, anticipating where the ball might drop.",
      "United lack a striker with excellent movement inside the 18-yard box, with Rasmus Hojlund often criticised for his poor positional awareness inside the penalty area.",
      "Gyokeres, who is well-versed in Amorim's 3-4-2-1 system, is equally capable of scoring from distance. He is also excellent at collecting the ball in deep areas of the pitch and using his power and pace to get his team up the pitch. His strength and running power would bring more athleticism to United's attack.",
      "Some may worry about him having no Premier League experience, and it is an understandable reservation after the club took gambles on Rasmus Hojlund and Joshua Zirkzee.",
      "However, Gyokeres has something those two do not have, and that is a proven goalscoring record. When it comes to signing a striker this summer, United have to sign one with exactly that.",

      "“That’s what happened in the last 48 hours over the weekend. From what I heard, last week Man Utd had new contacts with Viktor Gyokeres’ camp, to be informed on the situation, something like ‘okay, if Arsenal are not doing the deal we are still there, we are still interested’.",

      "A move to a Big Six club had been long overdue for perennial overachiever Thomas Frank as he’s made pretty light work of establishing Brentford in the Premier League, with two top-half finishes and three of his four seasons in the division ending without even the slightest fear of relegation.",
      "It’s a phenomenal achievement for a club of Brentford’s size and it’s a credit to them and Frank in particular, that it would feel weird not to have them in the Premier League with their feet firmly under the top-flight table.",
      "Frank’s move to Tottenham for a supposed upward career move could raise their relegation fears, but the ever-increasing gap to the Championship should cushion their likely decline next season as Leeds United and co. face an uphill battle to buck a disheartening trend.",
      "Brentford’s situation would become more problematic if several key stars follow Frank in leaving this summer, though.

      "Bukayo Saka has emphatically left Gabriel Martinelli in the dirt, with their respective development heading in opposite directions as the stagnated Brazil international’s uninspiring form has fuelled their interest in potential upgrades, including one ‘dream target’.",
      "With a large chunk of Arsenal’s summer budget likely to be spent on a striker, they may not have the financial muscle to splash out on a direct upgrade on Martinelli and if they decide to pursue an affordable option to compete with, rather than replace, the Gunners star, Schade would not be a bad shout.",
      "The 23-year-old, valued at £25m on transfermarkt amid reported interest from Borussia Dortmund, enjoyed a breakout season in 2024/25 and was a consistent provider of goal involvements, with his final total of 13 in 38 games a more-than-respectable tally.",

      "This is somewhat surprising given how shambolic United were in the 2024/25 season, but the grandeur of the club is  still enough to lure key targets to their “graveyard”.

      "Fulham didn’t suffer without him and Palhinha barely featured for Bayern, starting just nine matches in all competitions and failing to hit 1,000 minutes across the campaign. At 29, he might prefer to stick around at a club like Bayern, where he’s only an injury or two away from regular minutes under Vincent Kompany.",

      "The Danish international scored against England at Euro 2024, but it’s the rest of his game that’s got Europe’s elite taking notice. He’s now Sporting captain and, at 25, has the tools to become a world-class holding midfielder if he picks the right next step.",

      "Mainoo was once untouchable at Old Trafford, but INEOS-era chaos has quickly changed that. It’s surprising that he hasn’t nailed down a role under Ruben Amorim – stylistically, he fits – but he’s not looked fully sharp this year.",

      "Clubs might not think he’s worth £80million, but Brighton think he is, and they’re rarely wrong. They won’t sell for a penny less, either. They’re not quite Benfica levels of shrewd, but they’ve set the standard in England.",

      "Their top scorers in the league scored eight goals apiece, and neither were strikers. The highest-scoring striker out of centre-forwards Rasmus Hojlund and Joshua Zirkzee was the former, who bagged four goals in 32 games – one more than the Dutchman in the same amount.",

His time in Serie A was not quite so memorable, with Sven-Goran Eriksson playing him out of position at right-back in his only year outside of England, but he did keep his international place.",

      "Atletico Madrid (19)",
      "Two-and-a-half seasons of learning under the cojones of Simeone did absolutely nothing whatsoever to impact the England prospects of Trippier; it might even have strengthened them, considering it was somewhere around the defender’s move to Spain when Gareth Southgate decided that yeah, this man is also a left-back. It does not feel like a coincidence that he retired from international football straight after the manager resigned.",

      "Detroit Express (2), Sampdoria (20)",
      "Most will know that many of Francis’ England caps came during his spell in Sampdoria, but he also earned a couple of call-ups while on a weird kind of loan with NASL side Detroit Express. He headed to America at the end of the 1977/78 season with Birmingham, returned to become the first £1m footballer with Nottingham Forest in February 1979, then went back to Detroit that summer, never fully losing his grip on an England place.",

      "9) Ray Wilkins – 22 caps (of 84)",
      "AC Milan (22)",
      "Far from damaging his England prospects, Wilkins found that his candle shone brighter away from the spotlight. He made nine and ten international appearances in 1985 and 1986 respectively – his two full calendar years in Italy. Only in 1982 (12) did he play more often for his country.",

Much like James Rodriguez earned a move to Real Madrid with his exploits in 2014, Spain’s other giant saw fit to bring in Gary Lineker in 1986.

      "Milan (20), Monaco (7)",

      "Bari (7), Juventus (13), Sampdoria (13)",
      "One of two players to have earned England caps while playing for three different foreign clubs, Platt scored the Three Lions’ only goal at Euro 92 shortly after leaving Bari for Juventus. He would then have been at the 1994 World Cup as a Sampdoria player, had England actually qualified.",

      "Largely for the crime of playing club football in Germany and not becoming tabloid cannon fodder, Hargreaves was booed by a section of supporters and once described by The Sun as having ‘the public persona of a mass murderer’. Tunes were very much changed after an excellent 2006 World Cup but the midfielder was always on the right side of that argument.",

      "Borussia Dortmund (24), Real Madrid (19)",

      "Heading into the 2024/25 campaign, Onana‘s position at Man Utd was pretty secure as he grew into his debut season at Old Trafford after replacing David De Gea.",
      "However, Onana’s situation has drastically changed over the past year as his performances declined during the 24/25 season as he made several unforgivable mistakes.",
      "This summer is vital for Man Utd as they need to build a squad equipped to thrive under Ruben Amorim in his 3-4-3 formation and their priority has been to strengthen in forward positions.",

      "One Man Utd fan is more than happy for Liverpool to spend a fortune on Florian Wirtz in a Juan Sebastian Veron and Faustino Asprilla-flavoured gamble.",
      "Send your thoughts to theeditor@football365.com.",
      "",
      "Florian Asprilla or Faustino Wirtz?\nHi guys",
      "I think Niall makes some valid points. The only caveat I have is that Arne just won the league with a squad 99% created by Jurgen Klopp. I’m therefore confident that he’ll get it right with the players he wants to add to the squad.",
      "That said, the injury to Bajetic, who I thought might be Gravenberch’s understudy this season, highlights what Niall is saying that we should perhaps be prioritising other positions. If Grav is injured, does that mean our midfield is Mac, Szobo and Wirtz? And do we then bench Frimpong, and play Bradley as the much more defensive right back?",
      "If Kevin Keegan was our manager, I’d be emailing calling the Wirtz deal our Faustino Asprilla moment. As it is, in Arne we trust (but if he changes his mind, we trust then also).\nMichael, LFC, in Hackney",
      "",
      "There was an interesting take from Niall about whether we should be splashing out on Wirtz. Then noticed Football365 already (jokingly?) heating up the Wirtz Vs Cherki debate before its even started with the 10 transfers article.",
      "All this during times when one the one hand its very exciting to be linked with a mega-money signing but there is also the worry about what happens if it all falls through…the worst possible thing… being mocked by rival fans.",
      "I remember well the mocking and jeers at Caicedo chose Chelsea over us.  At the time it was a bit depressing. Going to be honest not that sad about it now though.",
      "I was kind of with Niall that maybe its too much and we shouldn’t be offering so much for one player, but then remembered that was exactly how I felt about Van Dijk, He was too expensive and we had embarrassed ourselves. That worked out pretty well. So I reckon we trust the Liverpool system now and realise they probably know what they are doing. They definitely know more than me about what is worth spending the money on.",
      "Anyway making a team of Dan’s was way trickier than I thought it would be. I realised that Dani Pacheco is 34 now and his breakthrough season is coming.",
      "GK Danny Ward\nRB Danny Alves\nCB Dan Burn\nCB Danilo Luiz da Silva\nLB Danny Rose",
      "CM Danny Murphy against Man united or Daniele De Rossi otherwise\nAM Dani Pacheco\nLW Dani Olmo\nRW Dan James",
      "ST Daniel Sturridge",
      "Don’t think its beating many teams sadly.",
      "Some Subs: Daniel Agger, Dani Carvajal, Danilo(Other one), Danny Mills, Dani Ceballos, Danny Ings, Danny Welbeck\nDan T",
      "",
      "Interesting to see Niall, Annapolis’ take on Liverpool’s move for Florian Wirtz this morning. I’m a United fan so I always have to parse my views on the Scousers’ business and avoid the “hope this goes to shit” lens that can distort my takes.",
      "But even when (I think) I manage to do that, I don’t see this as anything other than an odd departure from Liverpool’s normal modus operandi. The Frimpong and Kerkez deals make perfect sense – signing sorted early in the window, decent value obtained, lots of potential upside and limited exposure.",
      "But paying over £110m for one player, who maybe needs to be accommodated in a number 10 role which hasn’t been an orthodox part of Liverpool’s system for the past decade, looks laden with risk. Maybe this is the beginning of Slot shifting from Klopp’s system having had the good sense to not tear everything up when he first arrived. Maybe the balance between midfield and attack can be tweaked and refined. I wouldn’t assume to know the nuances of top level football well enough to categorically state one or the other.",
      "But in the interests of speculating, it does feel a bit Veron-to-United, or maybe Asprilla-to-Newcastle. A high profile, high quality player being added while in a position of strength, but maybe an unnecessary move that creates a selection issue rather than complementing the existing squad.",
      "To my eyes, that money would be better spent on a striker who gets closer to Firmino’s old levels than Nunez has since he joined.",
      "I could obviously be proven spectacularly wrong. Wirtz might be the centrepiece of a grand plan and maybe they build successfully around him. But as a fan of what should be a rival club, I’m okay-ish with Liverpool planning to spend such a high % of their transfer funds on him. To put it in terms that fans of the other big teams might relate to: I’d feel infinitely more concerned if they were dangling that £110m+ in front of Newcastle and going heavy to get Isak.\nKeith Reilly",
      "",
      "Am I missing something?\nAt the bottom of many of the pages I read on this very fine website a poll is running, ‘Who will win the 2025/26 Premier League title?’ and the current results are shocking, they may have changed but at the time of writing it is as below:",
      "Liverpool – 45%\nArsenal – 21%\nMan City – 14%\nChelsea 5%\nNewcastle – 5%\nOther – 11%",
      "I’m just going to rank these in the order I think the top 4 teams will actually finish next season:",
      "1st. Man City – 14% – Huh?",
      "How has Man City fallen this far in the eyes of the “informed” football public? This is a team that has won 6 out of the last 8 seasons, a team that has beaten record after record consistently since Pep took over, a team that had a manager who had quite a few personal problems to deal with this season and still finish 3rd after a meltdown and missing their best player, the lynch pin of the squad, being out for most of the season.",
      "They started rebuilding in January and have just added more quality players, a lot of people forget how this team was built, to solve problems this City team just spends £50 million on a player, if it doesn’t work out, they buy another £50 million player in the same position, rinse and repeat, look at the saga of left back till Kyle Walker signed. They have been keeping their hand in their pocket for the last couple of seasons (probably due to a 115 reasons) but don’t get this team wrong, they are willing to spend and spend big to get back on their perch.",
      "FFP means nothing to them until a punishment is given and by cementing themselves as too big to fail, the FA are more than likely to just roll over, charge them £100 million and dock them 40 points, they finish 8th – 6th on 60 points that season and then go back to winning ways getting another 3 titles until Pep buggers off and then the clone of Alex Ferguson takes over just to take the piss.",
      "How quick people forget, barring Rodri suffering from PTSD due to his injury, this team will win the title next season, just look at the team. Erling will put his other scoring boots on and get the golden boot by December (its weird that a striker who got 31 goals in 44 appearances is seen as a poor season but he is that good), Rodri is one of only 2 defensive players to win the Ballon d’Or in recent memory (last 20 years), Phil Foden is still quite talented, Cherki and Reijnders are coming, they have a shed load of underage talent (not in the Epstein way) and Ederson is Ederson and always will be Ederson. They’ve even got Oscar Bobb, who you’ve never heard of but he has one premier league medal more than you.",
      "This is Man Cities title to lose, the also rans will just have to wait till Pep goes through another divorce or for FFP to give a points deduction, which ever comes first.",
      "2nd. Liverpool – 45% – Wait, what?",
      "At the start of this season Liverpool people thought we were lucky to make it into the top four, let alone win the thing with 4 games to go. I think Liverpool were criminally underrated due to the unknown of Arnie Slot, the season before they had been trying to get the quady for Klopp and were very close (they still had a chance until the 17/03), the change of manager was the only major thing and for the first half of this season no team could touch them, Liverpool went from a team that was on default tactics on Pro Evo to the dick who spends 40 minutes setting up their team while everyone else sits around getting drunk.",
      "They were more fun under Klopp but they are now scarier, Klopps team were headstrong running though walls, if the wall didn’t go down they would still run until they knocked themselves out, Slots team has learnt to move around the wall, apart from the PSG match which they lost but were incredible in, this team always looked like it could go to another level in a match but usually won without having to do it.",
      "The transfers of Frimpong, Kerkez and Wirtz are statement signings, showing intent to be the next era of football, beating all in their path, sadly, like Klopps team when we bought Allison and Van Dyke, they are coming up against a juggernaut called Man City. A striker will help and Liverpool will push City all the way to the end but they will not beat them, this season wasn’t the start of Man Cities downfall, it was just a blip that happened under extraordinary bad luck, luck they have paid a lot of money to change.",
      "I understand recency bias but nearly half the people who visit this website think Liverpool will win next season, I find that insane, we might be making the right noises but you can’t forget the past, it always bloody repeats itself.",
      "3rd. Arsenal – 21% – Ha!",
      "I don’t want to troll Arsenal fans, some of my best friends are Arsenal fans but 21% HA. This team is youngish, has unbelievable talent and can beat anyone on their day, they have an attack that a Saudi team would pay a billion for and a defence that would get £750 million, they have a lot more strength than a “usual” Arsenal team and have the options to bully or out pass a lot of teams, on football manager this is the team you would want as it’d take a few shrewd signings and some really good half time team talks to be a treble winner.",
      "The problem I’ve found with this Arsenal team is the sense of entitlement, the manager and a vocal minority of the fan base, seem to have, they both have an excuse for every situation and seem to think that they deserve to win it just because they played well for 3 seasons. “If it wasn’t for a red card”, “If we hadn’t had injuries”, “If the wind had blown in a different direction”, “if the season had started at christmas…”, its just excuse after excuse.",
      "When Liverpool were always the bridesmaid they didn’t complain anywhere near the amount as some of these youtube, voice of the fan, cockgobblers and Klopp didn’t whine as much as Arteta does, he’s a sexy man with a sexy wife with a sexy life, why does he always look like someone has pissed on his chips. (Might try and turn that last line into a song)",
      "This unearned arrogance seems to have seeped into the mentality of the team, the strops the players have from time to time are apparent, a card goes against them, a VAR decision is DEFINITELY wrong or a tackle was a bit hard and they down tools, wanting to take the ball home because the beautiful game has been marred because its not the Arsenal way.",
      "If this team got a new manager (hopefully Arteta just moves on when they come third next season so the board don’t look like bad guys when they fire him) they could go from strength to strength, if he hadn’t of managed Tottenham Ange would of been great as long as he wasn’t allowed near the tactics, his infectious personality and will to win while also admitting when they are shit was a breath of fresh air and if it had been at Arsenal you could see a completely different player mentality.",
      "Another reason for my reaction is that they haven’t won anything, don’t bring up that bloody FA Cup, they are always near but in the final part of a season/cup they just fall away because they thought they’d already won it, this season would of been hilarious if Man City had got up to second, another “How does Arsenal come 3rd in a 2 horse race?” would of turned them into the new Spurs and who wouldn’t want Arsenal to turn into the new Spurs.",
      "4th.  Aston Villa – 0% (or 11% with other) – Why not?",
      "Its not about Aston Villa being better, its about Aston Villa having less intense games to deal with, the Europa Cup, while fun, isn’t anywhere near as taxing as Champs League, Newcastle are still paper thin having a lot of the same back up players they had in the championship, Chelsea are still young and while they could become amazing, I can also see this becoming the norm around European match time, resting players for the wednesday, losing, playing on the wednesday, losing and then because the teams knackered they lose on the following Saturday, having 3 loses in a row which is a heavy hit to the mentality of a young team.",
      "Man United are still rebuilding from the last rebuild, Tottenham are Tottenham and will forever be Tottenham, Forest may make an upset but its a long season, they will more than likely do what they did this season and sadly fall away. Brighton could get in there, they have a great squad which is constantly being pillaged by the bigger boys, if they can keep them this season and not having any European football its on the card (what a weird sentence, Brighton being a top four team)",
      "Aston Villa has become a team to be reckoned with, we’ve seen what they can do with a competent manager and a team of battle hardened machines that know what they need to do, add a bit of flair into this team and this is a no brainer.",

      "Spurs’ injury crisis\nHi there,",
      "I don’t have a dog in the fight over whether or not Ange should have been sacked, nor do I care a whit whether or not Spurs or Arsenal have had a more successful season, but I’m not sure that O Clark gets to use Spurs’ defensive injury crisis as an argument in defence of Postecoglu.",
      "There’s a fairly solid evidence base that he bears some culpability for the repeated and identical injuries that their defenders have suffered, not merely in terms of the high line system that they play, but also in terms of his somewhat antediluvian training methods.",
      "And that’s not even talking about how common it is for players to break down immediately on return from injury, which leads one to believe that he may be rushing them back too early from their rehabilitation.",
      "I accept that a central defensive partnership of Archie Gray and Ben Davies is sub-optimal, but the fact that Gray and Davies are the only central defenders available to Postecoglu might be cause for condemnation rather than exoneration.\nDara O’Reilly, London",

Winning a cup (even a lesser one) is a big part of building a dominant team that is able to handle those biggest games.",
      "If Arteta had won a trophy this season people wouldn’t suddenly say he was doing a good job (he is already, let’s be honest), but as a Liverpool fan I’d be very nervous that this Arsenal team had managed to get over that hurdle. Until that point, there will always be a question over the team taking that final step.\nTom, Andover",

      "Winning cup trophies is not equal to league success or exhibit superiority over better teams that would usually  beat cup winners in the league(see crystal palace vs city, arsenal vs city in the FA cup), however it does show the ability of the inferior team to beat opposition despite the clear disparity in terms of football skills  and the potential to improve-building from their win.",
      "Cup wins signify success. Tottenham won the Europa cup. Spurs were successful.",
      "Football shall not remember arsenal finishing 2nd for the 3rd time rather it will tell the tale of the Australian guy who won that European cup and the victory by spurs over a supposedly bigger opponent. Cup wins are indeed a measure of a teams’ success even while experiencing failure at the league level.",
      "Ange was a realist. He accepted the situation he was in, where the odds were stacked against him-the players ability (Son was the only world class talent), consistency, cohesion and motivation to win games,support from management was highly depleted-eventually leading him to the transparent conclusion that a league triumph was impossible but the euro cup was achievable. This gamble was made despite the consequences of league defeats to inferior opposition while playing with an (apparently) uninspiring style of football but the cup win was worth it(you could see the happiness of spurs fans despite enduring a bad league season and the subsequent drama in football it brought, like arsenal assuming the mantle of the ‘spursy’ team of the season).",

      "“It is simple. To do something, we need to sell players.”",
      "Ruben Amorim there, acknowledging publicly in February what he must have been saying behind closed doors for three months prior to that. Since then, his resolve to make major changes at Old Trafford can only have strengthened in the wake of United’s worst season in living memory, their wretched failures making it more imperative that the Red Devils finally learn how to sell.",
      "Amorim has commenced his rebuild, paying £62million to get Matheus Cunha from Wolves and Man Utd will probably spend a similar sum on Bryan Mbeumo. Given the chance, Amorim might drop the same again on Viktor Gyokeres. All of which will make Man Utd a lot more fun to watch. But vibes won’t pay their bills.",
      "The club’s financial situation is perhaps not as perilous as Sir Jim Ratcliffe might want us to believe while Man Utd go through another round of layoffs. It was thought that Amorim might have just shy of £100million to spend in the summer market before he had to raise funds through sales. Any two of the three aforementioned forwards would take Man Utd well over that budget.",
      "So it’s time to sell, sell, sell. Something they are notoriously bad at. And the early signs suggest they are yet to catch on.",
      "The Telegraph gave an insight into United’s sales strategy only last month. Apparently, the Red Devils believed they could rake in £90million by selling Jadon Sancho, Marcus Rashford and Antony.",
      "At best, that was wishful thinking. At worst, another sign of the delusion and incompetence that has made Man Utd one of the biggest patsies in the European game.",
      "United’s best hope with Sancho was they were dealing with Chelsea. If the Blues won’t do that deal, who will? Who is going to pay serious money for a barely-arsed big name, one with another year left on a massive contract who everyone knows Man Utd want shot of?",
      "It is a similar story with Rashford. An unwanted, disinterested player on a huge salary. Any club tempted to give the England forward a fresh start would be daft to offer Man Utd anything more than the loan-first deal Villa initially agreed to then refused to follow through on.",
      "Antony might be a more straightforward sale. Yes, at a price to shame United’s recruiters again but and even while offering a £60million hit, there is hardly a clamour, despite the Brazilian showing some signs of life at Real Betis.",
      "Rather than bank £90million to put towards a rebuild, more likely is that two, maybe all three, will once more be loaned out, only after they have sulked around Carrington for some or much of pre-season, before Man Utd accept liability for significant portions of their salary.",
      "That reality appears to have dawned on Man Utd if there’s any truth in the report that they have sought to fill some of that black hole by increasing their asking price for one of their more sellable assets.",
      "However, we can only assume whomever forecasted a £90million deposit for their loan exiles also priced Alejandro Garnacho at £70million. Because that’s an equally nonsensical figure.",
      "Garnacho is no more wanted than Sancho, Rashford, Antony. Less so, perhaps, given Amorim is more familiar with his flaws than the others’. And any club who might take a chance on the Argentina international knows it.",
      "“You better pray that you can find a club to sign you,” Garnacho was told by Amorim during the Bilbao inquest. And, sure, it will serve the player to be elsewhere next season. But Man Utd ought to be the party dropping to their knees. Without divine intervention, they have no hope of raking in £70million for the maddeningly-inconsistent winger.",
      "Chelsea and Arsenal have both been linked with Garnacho, but both have cheaper, arguably better alternatives. Napoli, Atletico Madrid and Bayer Leverkusen all interested, are they? Not at that price, not while United’s desire to be rid of Garnacho is so well documented.",
      "To furnish Amorim with the bare minimum he needs to jumpstart the Man Utd juggernaut on the road to credibility, the Red Devils must at least double the £100million they started with. Selling the four-man bomb squad is unlikely to achieve that, let alone rake in the £160million they anticipated.",
      "Who else could Man Utd take to market? Bruno Fernandes scuppered whatever plans the club may have had to cash in on their captain. Many Man Utd fans, including Gary Neville, would be loathe to see Kobbie Mainoo sold to the highest bidder but the homegrown midfielder is one of few others over whom Man Utd could negotiate from a position of authority.",
      "For the vast majority of Amorim’s squad, certainly those he wants rid of, it is a buyer’s market. And before long, a borrower’s one.",
      "A rant from Ruben Amorim has reportedly ‘weakened’ the negotiating position of Manchester United for one of their players, meaning his value might have dropped by £20million.",
      "Manchester United will have to wait for a European giant to spring into action in the ‘latter stages’ of the summer transfer window for a sale, so hopes of it ...",
      "A new FC Barcelona transfer target could reportedly  ‘close the door’ on Marcus Rashford’s proposed move from Manchester United to the La Liga giants.",

      "Ekitike is now beginning to justify those comparisons after a strong season with Frankfurt. With 22 goals in all competitions for the Bundesliga club, this was something of a breakthrough for a player who had looked set to shine a little earlier.",
      "The move from Reims to PSG was a bold one given the competition. With Mbappe, Neymar and Lionel Messi still at the club, Ekitike's minutes were limited. The majority of his appearances came off the bench. \"Any striker would have struggled,\" says Oscar.",
      "\"But, for sure, he learned a lot and now he is a better player because of it.\" Frankfurt have long been shrewd operators in the transfer market and recognised that failing to shine amid the stars at PSG was no slight on such a talented young prospect.",
      "Following an initial loan last season, Ekitike made the move permanent last summer and kicked on significantly after turning 22 last summer. Under coach Dino Toppmoller, the football seemed to suit him and he was fundamental to Frankfurt's success.",
      "Ekitike provided the impetus up front as they shrugged off the sale of Omar Marmoush to Manchester City in January to secure third spot, matching their best finish of the Bundesliga era, not achieved since the days when the great Tony Yeboah was leading the line.",
      "During the first part of the season, he operated alongside Marmoush in a modern-looking strike partnership. It was not exactly a case of the big man and the little man. Instead, they both had freedom to roam into wide areas and shared the responsibilities.",
      "That is because, despite being 6'3\" tall, Ekitike is far from a traditional target man. \"He is not a kind of a striker who will be always into the box waiting for a cross, he is very mobile and very difficult to mark.\" He likes to use his pace to run into the channels.",
      "The only player to score as many goals on the counter-attack as Ekitike in the Bundesliga this past season was Marmoush himself - indicative of Frankfurt's approach. But Oscar believes that the skillset is such that he can adapt if needed.",
      "\"He can fit with teams that play more counter-attack but also with teams with more possession, because he has the skill for both styles.\" That is what makes him an intriguing option for the elite clubs. There is a belief that there is much more to come.",
      "\"You do not find many strikers like him at his age. He is tall, fast, mobile, very good one against one, holds the ball and scores goals.\"",
      "While his total of 15 Bundesliga goals represents his best return yet, that too might just be a sign of better things to come. Analysts will have noted that Ekitike had 117 shots in the competition during the 2024/25 season - more than anyone else, including Harry Kane.",
      "Ekitike actually significantly underperformed his expected-goals total. And while that statistic could be used to criticise his finishing, it also suggests that he is a player who is able to consistently get himself into scoring positions. Work to do. But lots to work with.",
      "\"All players can improve. He knows which aspects he can improve on but he also needs help to develop his potential to reach the level that all the people who know him believe he can reach. Individual work with him will be fundamental for his development.\"",
      "But that development is happening. Already quick and skilful, physically there are signs that he is learning how to use his frame to better effect, while mentally it was a positive for scouts that he stepped up when more was needed in the second half of the season.",
      "After the PSG experience, Frankfurt was a smart choice, but it is the next move, the next page in his development plan, that will be fascinating. Is he now ready for that super club second time around? However big the target, Ekitike will back himself to hit it.",

      "\"I can guarantee that Viktor Gyokeres will not leave for 60m euros plus 10m euros because I never promised that,\" said Varandas. \"To this day, Sporting has not received an offer for Gyokeres - neither today nor last summer.\"",
      "Varandas says Gyokeres' agent sought assurances from him and sporting director Hugo Viana - who has now left to join Man City in a similar role - that the player would be allowed to leave for less than his release clause in a meeting earlier this season.",
      "The Sporting president said the agent also asked for an agreement over the asking price - but he was unwilling to commit to specific numbers.",
      "Varandas added: \"What was agreed in that meeting? That Sporting would not demand the release clause [this summer].",
      "\"For one reason, it was because we know no player leaves Portugal at 27 for €100m or €90m euros.",
      "\"In that same meeting the agent wanted to anchor the exit to a value. I said this sentence: 'It's not worth us setting a value because I don't know what will happen in a year's time. I don't know if it will be 40m euros, 60m or 80m. What I can guarantee is that I will not demand 100m euros.'\"",
      "Two years after signing him for around £20m from Coventry, Sporting stand to make a huge profit on Viktor Gyokeres.",
      "The 27-year-old, who hit 40 goals in 97 games after joining Coventry from Brighton in 2021, has scaled new heights in Portugal, scoring 97 times in 102 games for Sporting in all competitions since his arrival in 2023 and becoming one of the most coveted strikers in Europe.",
      "Manchester United have made an initial approach over a potential reunion with his former boss Ruben Amorim. Gyokeres is also of interest to Arsenal as the Gunners aim to strengthen their attack.",
      "His scoring exploits for Sporting, which include six goals in eight Champions League appearances last season, have seen him treble in value to £75m in the space of two years, according to the website Transfermarkt, reflecting the speed of his rise to prominence.",

      "First summer transfer window shuts as Premier League's Club World Cup clubs, Chelsea and Manchester City, both make moves ahead of tournament; Man Utd make most expensive signing with £62.5m arrival of Matheus Cunha; main summer window reopens on Monday and closes on September 1",
      "Wednesday 11 June 2025 10:08, UK",
      "As the summer's first transfer window slams shut, Premier League clubs have spent nearly half a billion on new signings - and there is still so much business to be done.",
      "Few knew what to expect from this special window brought in ahead of the Club World Cup - but it has delivered 10 days of transfer drama and set the tone for what promises to be a fascinating summer. And we are just six days away from it re-opening.",
      "Manchester City have been the big spenders thus far after doing their business early by bringing in Tijjani Reijnders, Rayan Cherki, Rayan Ait Nouri and Marcus Bettinelli - taking their outlay to £116.2m.",
      "Despite three of City's signings being announced on Deadline Day, it was Chelsea, the other Premier League team at the Club World Cup, that were centre of attention once again as they chased potential late deals for Jamie Gittens and Mike Maignan.",
      "Chelsea ended their pursuit of Maignan, the AC Milan goalkeeper, around lunchtime because the Italian club were unwilling to lower their demands for the 29-year-old, who is out of contract in a year and valued at no more than £12m by the Blues.",
      "Their chase for Gittens had more legs but also ended in disappointment - for now at least. Dortmund rejected Chelsea's £42m bid and demanded closer to £55m late in the day and time ran out for the clubs to come to an agreement.",
      "Chelsea were happy to wait as they do not want to overpay for Gittens and plan to revisit the deal further down the line. Gittens, who wants to move to Chelsea, appeared frustrated as he sped out of Dortmund's training ground at day's end.",
      "Dortmund were able to get an incoming deal over the line ahead of the tournament as they signed Jobe Bellingham from Sunderland in a club-record sale for the newly-promoted Premier League club, who are receiving an initial £27.8m for the 19-year-old.",
      "Before Bellingham's exit, the Black Cats had confirmed the club-record £20m signing of midfielder Enzo Le Fee after a successful loan spell from Roma.",
      "Premier League clubs have splashed nearly £500m after only 10 days of the first summer window, which is already close to half the amount spent during the entire 2021/22 summer window.",
      "Manchester City have been the most spendthrift club as Pep Guardiola's side look to rebuild after a disappointing campaign, spending a table-topping £116.3m so far.",
      "At the other end of the scale, Wolves are nearly £100m in profit after selling star players Matheus Cunha and Rayan Ait Nouri.",
      "Burnley and Chelsea lead the way for total incomings, with both sides signing four players on permanent deals. Only seven sides are yet to secure a signing.",
      "Arsenal have offloaded 17 players, while Wolves (13), Burnley and Spurs (both 10) have also trimmed their squads considerably.",
      "Cunha's £62.5m switch to Manchester United is the most expensive deal in the window so far, followed by Tijjani Reijnders (£46.3m), Rayan Ait Nouri (£36m), Jean-Clair Todibo (£35m) and Rayan Cherki (£34m).",
      "In terms of outgoings, Bournemouth cashed in £50m from selling Dean Huijsen to Real Madrid, while Sunderland sold Jobe Bellingham to Borussia Dortmund for £32m and Manchester City sold Yan Couto to Dortmund for £25m.",
      "Meanwhile, Chelsea bolstered their frontline ahead of the Club World Cup with the £30m arrival of Liam Delap from Ipswich.",
      "The 22-year-old is one of three signings along with Mamadou Sarr and Dario Essugo, who have been recruited in time to play in the USA. Estevao Willian will join from Palmeiras after the Club World Cup - and he could face Chelsea at the tournament playing for the Brazilian side.",
      "Arsenal target Benjamin Sesko emerged as a option for Saudi Pro League club Al Hilal, who have been turned down by Bruno Fernandes and Victor Osimhen in the last week, as they scrambled to make a marquee signing in time for the Club World Cup.",
      "However, the RB Leipzig striker's preference to play for a top club in Europe amid talks with Arsenal appeared to stop Al Hilal from taking their interest any further on Deadline Day. They will have to make do with Aleksandar Mitrovic as their striker in the USA.",
      "Sesko will be one of the names to watch for the rest of the summer, with Arsenal seemingly prioritising a move for the 22-year-old ahead of Sporting's Viktor Gyokeres in their hunt for a striker. Adding a left-winger is another priority, with Real Madrid's Rodrygo a top target. At the other end of the pitch, Arsenal are progressing with a deal to sign Chelsea goalkeeper Kepa Arrizabalaga and are expected to trigger the £5m release clause.",
      "The Gunners have taken a backseat in the early running of the window, though, with Premier League champions Liverpool making multiple club-record bids for attacking midfielder Florian Wirtz from Bayer Leverkusen after he turned down Bayern Munich.",
      "Wirtz only wants to move to Anfield but so far the clubs have failed to reach an agreement with Liverpool's latest offer worth £113m - just £2m shy of the British record set by Moises Caicedo's transfer to Chelsea from Brighton in 2023.",
      "The Germany international's keenness on the move has ensured the lengthy negotiations have not created too much anxiety among Liverpool fans, who have lost key player Trent Alexander-Arnold to Real Madrid for £10m and goalkeeper Caoimhin Kelleher to Brentford in an £18m deal.",
      "But Liverpool, who have goalkeeper Giorgi Mamardashvili joining from Valencia, have already signed a right-sided player following Alexander-Arnold's exit with the £29.5m arrival of Jeremie Frimpong, while on the other side, they are eyeing a move for Bournemouth left-back Milos Kerkez.",
      "Initial contact has been made with the Cherries, who have already lined up a replacement in Adrien Truffert from Rennes. Andoni Iraola's side face a potential rebuild this summer, having already lost Dean Huijsen to Real Madrid for £50m, while they have received an approach from Paris Saint-Germain for Illia Zabarnyi.",
      "An offer from Liverpool for Kerkez is the next step in that deal, but how many more incomings there will be at Anfield could depend on the future of Luis Diaz.",
      "The 28-year-old raised doubts about his future when he revealed he was in talks with other clubs while away with Colombia after the Merseyside club rejected an approach from Barcelona.",
      "Diaz is one of two targets Barcelona have for the forward position, along with Marcus Rashford from Manchester United, whose future appears certain to be away from Old Trafford. Interest is expected in the 27-year-old, who will cost £40m this summer.",
      "Manchester United have been unusually quick out of the blocks with their business after signing Matheus Cunha from Wolves for £62.5m - the most expensive signing of the summer so far.",
      "Man Utd are already eyeing their second summer signing with an approach for Brentford forward Bryan Mbeumo, who is keen on the move.",
      "The Bees have turned down their opening £55m offer, though talks are continuing and United are expected to return with an improved offer for the forward, valued at more than £60m. Once that pursuit has concluded, the plan is to try and sign a striker.",
      "Gyokeres is one of their targets, and approaches have been made for the Sporting striker through intermediaries as United look to ascertain the conditions of a potential deal. It will likely take a few sales to facilitate any further signings after the potential arrival of Mbeumo, though.",
      "Rashford, Alejandro Garnacho and Antony are among those who could go with plenty of interest anticipated. Rasmus Hojlund is a target for Inter Milan but has said he expects to remain at United despite the club being linked to other strikers.",
      "Man Utd's Europa League final conquerors, Tottenham, are yet to make a fresh addition to their squad as they close in on the managerial appointment of Thomas Frank after sacking Ange Postecoglou. But Spurs have stepped up their interest in Bournemouth forward Antoine Semenyo, valued at £70m by the south coast club.",
      "Tottenham are one of 12 Premier League clubs yet to make a major summer signing (excluding loans being made permanent, or deals agreed in previous windows), so expect things to really ramp up when the transfer window reopens on Monday before closing on September 1 at 7pm.",

      "Tuesday 10 June 2025 09:42, UK",
      "United are exploring the conditions of a potential deal for the 27-year-old. Head coach Ruben Amorim is a big admirer of Gyokeres having managed him at Sporting.",
      "Gyokeres has a gentleman's agreement to leave Sporting this summer for offers above £58m (€70m) despite a release clause of around £84m (€100m).",

      "United are in the market for a striker regardless of Rasmus Hojlund's future. Although the Denmark international has said he is not considering leaving the club and will fight for his place next season, United are looking at a number of players in that position.",
      "However, a big focus at United will be on departures too, with offers expected for the likes of Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho, Alejandro Garnacho and Antony.",
      "The preference is to agree to permanent sales for those players, however loan deals cannot be ruled out. There has been plenty of interest - but as yet, no formal offers.",
      "Sporting paid roughly £20m to sign Gyokeres from Coventry in 2023 but they are expected to make a huge profit on his anticipated sale.",
      "The 27-year-old, who scored 40 times in 97 games for Coventry, joining on loan from Brighton initially before making the move permanent in 2021, has hit new heights since his switch to Portugal, smashing 97 goals in 102 games for Sporting, including 11 in 17 in European competition.",
      "His remarkable scoring exploits have seen him treble in value to £75m in the space of two years, according to the website Transfermarkt, who valued him at less than £1m when he joined Coventry from Brighton in the summer of 2021.",
      "He has proved a late bloomer but his rapid rise to prominence in recent seasons has put him on the shortlists of some of the biggest clubs in Europe.",
      "His availability for £58m, considerably less than his Transfermarkt valuation, has made him even more attractive to his suitors, including Manchester United. A reunion with Amorim, the manager who helped bring the best out of him at Sporting, now looks a possibility.",
      "The club are expected to go back in with an improved offer for Brentford forward Bryan Mbeumo after having their first bid rejected, and they remain optimistic a deal can be struck.",
      "There are reports suggesting Thomas Frank will try and tempt Mbeumo to go to Tottenham Hotspur if he takes over as their new head coach, wowever it's understood the player wants to join United.",
      "Man Utd saw their opening bid of £55m rejected. The offer consisted of a guaranteed £45m plus £10m in bonuses.",
      "There is a feeling at Brentford that Mbeumo has earned the chance to move to a bigger club this summer if one meets his valuation.",
      "United have already agreed a deal to sign Matheus Cunha from Wolves for £62.5m.",
      "The transfer is subject to visa and registration, which is expected to be formally completed once the Brazil forward returns from international duty.",

      "He also notched seven assists but should have registered more, clocking a league-topping 9.26 expected assists during the campaign - primarily from delivering a table-topping 202 crosses.",
      "Additionally, only two players covered more distance or attempted more sprints for the season, making him one of the hardest grafters in the league. He also provides serious pace - clocking the fourth-fastest speed at 36.63 km/h.",
      "Factoring in decisive goals or assists that changed the outcomes of games, his 27 goal contributions earned Brentford 22 points - equating to 40 per cent of the Bees' season tally.",

      "Tuesday 10 June 2025 15:13, UK",
      "Two years after signing him for around £20m from Coventry, Sporting stand to make a huge profit on Viktor Gyokeres.",

      "Go back further and the contrast is even more stark. Transfermarkt valued him at only £450,000 when he agreed to join Brighton from Swedish club IF Brommapojkarna in late 2017. He was valued at only £830,000 when he turned his loan to Coventry permanent in 2021.",
      "The explosion in his value began after that, as he followed up an 18-goal first season at Coventry with a 22-goal campaign in his second. In the summer of 2023, his Transfermarkt valuation was roughly in line with the £20m fee paid by Sporting.",
      "Two years and 97 goals later, Gyokeres holds added appeal to suitors such as Manchester United given he is thought to be available for considerably less than his current £75m valuation.",
      "Despite having an £84m release clause in his contract, Gyokeres struck a gentleman's agreement with Sporting last year that he would be allowed to leave this summer for offers worth £59m.",

      "Gyokeres's scoring record speaks for itself and a deeper look at his numbers, compared to those of other strikers across the top seven European leagues, underlines just how good he was last season.",
      "His scoring rate of 1.25 goals per 90 minutes was higher than anyone else's. He also ranked top for touches in the opposition box. He was in the 97th percentile for shots, at 4.46 per 90 minutes.",
      "He ranked in the 98th and 95th percentiles for fast breaks and successful take-ons, underlining his ball-carrying ability, and he also posted impressive numbers creatively.",
      "His average of 1.99 chances created per 90 minutes put him in the 96th percentile among strikers in Europe's top-seven leagues. He ranked in the 84th percentile for assists on 0.22 per 90 minutes.",
      "Gyokeres demonstrated impressive intensity out of possession too, ranking in the 97th percentile for possessions won in the final third, reflecting the effectiveness of his pressing.",
      "There is of course a caveat in that Gyokeres has been competing in a comparatively weak league. According to UEFA coefficient rankings, Portugal's top-flight sits below the Dutch Eredivisie as the seventh strongest in Europe.",
      "Could he replicate his scoring feats in the league which ranks top?",
      "Gyokeres showed his suitability to English football with his impressive spell at Coventry, but the Premier League is a huge step up from the Championship - and from the Portuguese league.",
      "Manchester United must weigh up that unknown as they ponder the pros and cons of a potential move, but they can offer the familiarity of the head coach, in Amorim, who helped bring the best out of him at Sporting, a club who now stand to profit considerably from his sale.",

      "Tottenham have stepped up their interest in Antoine Semenyo; Man Utd also remain admirers of the Bournemouth forward; he is also on the list at Liverpool this summer and is believed to favour playing for a Champions League club - but has not yet ruled out a move to Old Trafford",
      "Monday 9 June 2025 18:40, UK",
      "Tottenham have stepped up their interest in Antoine Semenyo.",
      "Manchester United also remain admirers of the Bournemouth forward despite having a bid rejected for Brentford forward Bryan Mbeumo - a player also on the list at Spurs.",
      "Mbeumo appears to be United's priority target after a £55m offer was rejected by Brentford last week - and they are expected to follow up with another offer.",
      "There have been reports that Thomas Frank wants Spurs to sign Mbeumo if he becomes their new head coach - but it is ultimately Spurs as a club that decide who they sign.",
      "Chairman Daniel Levy and technical director Johan Lange call the recruitment shots, with the returning Fabio Paratici also having a say - so a Frank arrival would not necessarily make a move for Mbeumo inevitable.",
      "He is also on the list at Liverpool this summer and is believed to favour playing for a Champions League club - but has not yet ruled out a move to Old Trafford.",
      "It means both Semenyo and Mbeumo's futures remain in the balance as Frank nears the head coach role at Tottenham - an event that may prove pivotal in the outcome for both men.",
      "Tottenham have opened talks with Brentford for Thomas Frank.",
      "Discussions between the clubs over compensation are under way. Spurs have no second or third-choice options. Frank is and has been the No 1 target for board members.",
      "Frank is interested in taking the job and wants to speak to Spurs. Although Brentford do not wish to stand in his way if he wants to move to a bigger club, they do not plan to let him go on the cheap.",
      "Brentford are prepared to listen to offers from Spurs but expect them to be serious ones.",
      "Frank has a release clause in his contract, which has two years left to run. It is widely being reported to be in the region of £10m.",

      "Man Utd and Lisandro Martinez are understood to be satisfied with his rehabilitation since he underwent surgery four months ago; defender is on an individual programme as he works to return to fitness after being stretchered off against Crystal Palace at Old Trafford in February",
      "Saturday 7 June 2025 17:24, UK",
      "Manchester United defender Lisandro Martinez is aiming to return as early as possible next season as he makes good progress in his recovery from a cruciate ligament injury that has kept him out since early February.",
      "United and Martinez are understood to be satisfied with his rehabilitation since undergoing surgery four months ago and the latest tests carried out last week have confirmed that the 27-year-old has no tear in his meniscus.",
      "Neither Martinez nor United will take any unnecessary risks with integrating him back into the group and the player will not return until he is completely happy with his recovery and in peak physical condition.",
      "The Argentina international is on an individual programme over the summer break and will be working on the grass individually when the rest of the group are back for pre-season.",
      "Ruben Amorim, the United head coach, had been hugely impressed by Martinez before the injury, suffered in a 2-0 defeat to Crystal Palace at Old Trafford in the Premier League, and views the World Cup winner as a key pillar of his defence moving forward.",
      "Martinez is considered one of the group's leaders internally at Carrington and, in a summer when the club is moving swiftly to bolster a squad that finished 15th in the Premier League, having him back next season will come as a big boost.",
      "The defender is committed to United amid interest from clubs playing in next season's Champions League who are keeping a close eye on his recovery.",
      "United are pursuing a deal for Brentford's Bryan Mbeumo having already secured the £62.5 transfer of Matheus Cunha from Wolves and Martinez could feel like a new signing for Amorim when he is cleared fit.",
      "Martinez settled into Amorim's system quickly as the left-sided centre-back and was enjoying a good run of form before his injury, scoring crucial goals at Liverpool and Fulham in a run of six games when the team were unbeaten with him as a starter.",
      "The former Ajax defender is one of United's most progressive passers from deep and found more space to step forward and affect the game on the ball when the team shifted to a back three under the Portuguese.",
      "Amorim's approach plays to Martinez's strengths because the onus is on the defenders to build up play while the two No 8s are expected to play further up the pitch in a more box-to-box role rather than dropping deep to collect the ball from the back three.",
      "Across the 20 Premier League games Martinez played last season he was heavily relied on in possession, with the defender attempting and completing a higher volume of passes than any of his team-mates per 90 by some distance.",
      "With Amorim's system putting a greater emphasis on ball retention, there is an expectation he will lean on Martinez in that left centre-back position. His team-mates already do, with captain Bruno Fernandes the only other player taking more touches per 90.",
      "Martinez is not the quickest defender but reads the game well and that is helpful in Amorim's set-up with his defenders required to step up and intercept through balls - with Harry Maguire his only team-mate completing more per 90 in the league.",
