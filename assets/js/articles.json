      "Months before taking over at Manchester United, Ruben Amorim held talks with another Premier League club. However, he quickly recognised it was a mistake for him to speak to West Ham about succeeding David Moyes while he was still in the midst of a title race with Sporting CP.",
      "\"So let's get the elephant out of the room and I'll talk about it once,\" Amorim said in April 2024 when discussing the West Ham talks. \"The first thing is to say that the club was aware of my trip. It's important and changes the context.",
      "\"Then, talk about the cloak of secrecy that surrounded the trip. I secretly parked the car outside, secretly walked past 15 people, past people and took photographs and got on a plane to take away a little bit of this thing that was all done behind the club's back, that didn't happen.",
      "\"Obviously my trip was a mistake, the timing was completely wrong, it didn't seem right at the time. It was wrong, especially when I'm so demanding with my players and always the first to say that each one's problems don't go away. They can overpower the team, I have already removed players from the squad for much less. It was my mistake, I have to accept it and live with it.\"",
      "Amorim's first season in charge at United saw them limp to a lowly bottom-half finish, their worst in the Premier League era, with defeat in the Europa League final ensuring they would have no European football for the first time in more than a decade. Results have improved slightly this term, but not enough for the board to keep him in charge.",
      "\"With Manchester United sitting sixth in the Premier League, the club’s leadership has reluctantly made the decision that it is the right time to make a change,\" the club said in a statement on Monday morning. \"This will give the team the best opportunity of the highest possible Premier League finish.\"",
      "Since Amorim held talks with West Ham, the London side have cycled through several permanent managers of their own. Moyes was given the remainder of the 2023/24 season before being replaced by Julen Lopetegui, who only lasted half a season himself before making way for Graham Potter in January 2025.",
      "Potter was still in the dugout at the start of this season but got his marching orders in September, with Nuno Espirito Santo taking over. And now, with the Hammers four points from Premier League safety, there has been speculation over Nuno's future at the London Stadium.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Ruben Amorim was lucky to get as long as he did. Fourteen months at Old Trafford has brought just 25 wins in Amorim’s 63 games in charge and the worst win ratio of 32 per cent of any Manchester United manager in the Premier League era.",
      "Where is the team going? What is the team’s identity? You look at the table and you could argue that Amorim has made progress and is pushing for Europe. But that is when you need to check yourself and remember this is Manchester United we are talking about.",
      "This is the club which sees it itself as the biggest club in the world with the biggest ambitions and an incredible global fanbase which is absolutely second to none when it comes to backing their managers.",
      "And even the most loyal United supporters had become split on Amorim. United should not be languishing in sixth place after 20 very unconvincing games this season.",
      "The club backed the manager to the hilt in the summer. They spent £216m on new signings over the summer with Bryan Mbeumo, Benjamin Sesko, Matheus Cunha and Senne Lammens all arriving.",
      "United were absolutely right to stick with Amorim into this campaign and give him every chance to succeed because he took over mid-season and inherited a bit of a mess from Erik ten Hag.",
      "But a really top manager would be able to take the squad and turn them into a team fit to wear the shirt.",
      "Do you really think a manager of the class and pedigree of Pep Guardiola would be struggling in his second season? He would build a team which, even if it was not winning, would be competitive.",
      "Look at the job even Enzo Maresca did at Chelsea. He won trophies and got them into the Champions League places. Oliver Glasner is in the bookies’ list of favourites for United because of the job he has done at Crystal Palace. They won a trophy.",
      "All of those managers would unquestionably be doing better at United with the same players that Amorim has at his disposal. They would not be throwing away games and leads.",
      "Amorim was crazy to challenge the board in a power grab when actually he was doing a pretty average job. He needed their backing - not to spark a civil war.",
      "You also have to question him on specific players. You could make a case that Kobbie Mainoo was almost promoted too soon as he found himself in the heart of England’s midfield in the Euros.",
      "But Mainoo still showed that he is one of England’s brightest young stars. And the way he has been discarded and overlooked is a failure on Amorim’s part - not the player’s.",
      "Similar with Benjamin Sesko. He looks utterly broken. This is a serious player who has got potential and would be better in a better team with a better manager.",
      "When United signed Sesko, Cunha and Mbeumo in the summer, that should have been a front three to compete with the best in the Premier League. Then Bruno Fernandes also in the supply line.",
      "Instead, we get Amorim hardly ever using them together because he was so wedded to his tactics and formation. He left it too late to change. That is not being strong as a manager. It is a weakness to be so inflexible.",
      "It is all well and good to talk about other managers getting time. Mikel Arteta is a prime example. But Arsenal is different to Manchester United. Do you really think United can wait two years?",
      "Of course not. Even Sir Jim Ratcliffe misjudged that one when he said Amorim would get time. To get time, you have to show progress.",
      "And, ultimately, Amorim was not doing nearly enough to warrant more time. It is painful, brutal and looks chaotic. But United had to take the decision to sack him.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Ruben Amorim has been sacked as Manchester United manager just three months after owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe said he needed \"over three years\" in the hot seat before he could be judged. Amorim has lasted 14 months as United boss after he was dismissed on Monday morning following a remarkable press conference rant.",
      "Former midfielder and under-18s boss Darren Fletcher has been promoted to become the interim manager ahead of the Premier League game against Burnley on Wednesday. Amorim departs with a record of just 24 wins from his 63 matches in charge.",
      "Yet despite overseeing a 15th-place finish in the league last season, defeat in the Europa League final to Tottenham which deprived the club of European football and an embarrassing loss against Grimsby in the Carabao Cup, Amorim retained the backing of Ratcliffe in October.",
      "\"He has not had the best of seasons,\" the 30 per cent shareholder and controller of football decisions at United said on the Times' The Business podcast. \"Ruben needs to demonstrate he is a great coach over three years. That's where I would be.\"",
      "He added: \"The press, sometimes I don't understand. They want overnight success. They think it's a light switch. You know, you flick a switch and it's all going to be roses tomorrow. You can't run a club like Manchester United on knee-jerk reactions to some journalist who goes off on one every week.\"",
      "Tensions have been bubbling barely beneath the surface at United in recent weeks, with Amorim frustrated by his threadbare squad. Injuries to Bruno Fernandes, Mason Mount, Kobbie Mainoo, Harry Maguire and Matthijs de Ligt, as well as the absences of Bryan Mbeumo, Amad and Noussair Mazraoui at the Africa Cup of Nations, has left a seriously depleted squad.",
      "Things came to a head at Elland Road when Amorim responded angrily to a question about whether he retained the support of the board. \"Guys, to stop with that, and I noticed that you received selective information about everything. I came here to be the manager of Manchester United, not to be the coach of Manchester United. That is clear,\" he said.",
      "\"I know that my name is not Tuchel, is not Conte, is not Mourinho, but I'm the manager of Manchester United. It's going to be like this for 18 months or when the board decided to change. That was my point. I want to finish with that. I'm not going to quit. I will do my job until other guy is coming here to replace me.",
      "\"I just want to say that I'm going to be the manager of this team, not just the coach. I was really clear on that. That is going to finish in 18 months, and then everyone is going to move on.\"",
      "That rant ultimately caused his downfall and United will now begin the search for a new manager as they try to salvage another season.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Paul Scholes previously said Ruben Amorim did not understand Manchester United - and judging by the Portuguese coach's record at the club, the ex-Old Trafford midfielder was correct.",
      "Amorim, 40, was given his marching orders by United less than 24 hours after he lashed out at the likes of Gary Neville and other figures at the club in a \"bizarre\" press conference which ended with him storming out. United finished 15th at the end of last season, but Amorim was given his P45 when the club were in sixth place, just three points away from the top four.",
      "A flat 1-1 away draw with Leeds United proved to be Amorim's final game in charge, which is fitting given Scholes' previous criticism of the ex-United head coach. Moreover, Amorim's record, when stacked up against his predecessors, also support Scholes' comments.",
      "On the Good, the Bad and the Football Podcast, Scholes, while talking to ex-United team-mate Nicky Butt, said: \"I don't think this manager gets this club full stop. I just don't think he's the right man.",
      "\"Man United is about risk & entertainment, more than anything, at home especially. Having fans on the edge of their seat, ready to go, wingers who beat people, shots on goal, bits of skills. There’s nothing there.\"",
      "Amorim departs with a miserable record at United. While he did guide them to the Europa League final, he also walks away with lowest win-rate of any United manager in the Premier League.",
      "He only won 31.9% of his matches, winning 15, drawing 13 and losing 19. The next worst United boss was interim manager Ralf Rangnick, who only emerged victorious in 41.7% of his matches, winning 10, drawing seven and losing seven.",
      "Erik ten Hag, the man Amorim replaced at Old Trafford, won a lot more matches, registering 44 victories, 14 draws and 27 losses, a win rate of 51.8%. When it comes to the number of goals scored per-game, only Rangnick did worse than Amorim's record of 66 goals in 47 matches, equivalent to a goals per game ratio of 1.40, just 0.02 more than Rangnick's 1.38.",
      "While Scholes was scathing towards Amorim, he also hit out at the United board for deciding to appoint him in the first place. He said: \"We talk about this as a different club. They’ve got Omar Berrada, they’ve got Jason Wilcox, who are probably brilliant at their job, brilliant at what they do.",
      "\"They’re not Man Utd, they don’t have a clue what it’s like to buy a Manchester United player, to bring a Manchester United manager in. If you went to Sporting Lisbon and watched them, they play three at the back, right away that’s a no.",
      "\"Man Utd never do that. They can’t do that. It’s been proven over years, and years, and years and I’m talking before Sir Alex Ferguson, it was always about 4-4-1-1 or 4-4-2 and entertaining people. He hasn’t got that in him.",
      "\"He brought four defenders on against West Ham. If we go 1-0 up, the manager (Ferguson) always said, ‘Two, three, four.’ I think we were playing Chelsea, we went 1-0 up and we sat back a little bit.",
      "\"Now Chelsea were a good team. But the manager went absolutely nuts after the game. ‘That doesn’t happen here. When you score one, you go for two, you go for the throat every single time.’\"",

      "Amorim, who joined United from Sporting CP in November 2024, was vocal about his role within the club following his team's draw with Leeds on Sunday. He stated: \"I came here to be the manager of Manchester United, not to be the coach of Manchester United. And that is clear.",
      "\"I know that my name is not Tuchel, it's not Conte, it's not Mourinho, but I'm the manager of Manchester United. And it's going to be like this for 18 months, or when the board decides to change.\"",
      "Amorim voiced his concerns publicly with the January transfer window open, suggesting frustration with their recruitment. However, legendary United boss Sir Alex Ferguson had previously endorsed the club's summer signings, including praising the impact of goalkeeper Senne Lammens since his arrival at Old Trafford.",
      "\"There are signs, the manager has had some good signs,\" Ferguson told Raceday RTV in November. \"Particularly the goalkeeper has been outstanding, he's only played three or four games and he's looking really good.",
      "\"Of course, Mbeumo and Cunha, the new players from Wolves and Brentford, they've added to it. I hope the manager gets a bit of success because at United you need to have success - the signs are getting better.",
      "\"I think back-to-back wins is something teams like United should always expect. But having gone through a cycle where the improvement has to come by waiting and being patient, they'll enjoy it now.\"",
      "While Ferguson did not mention new striker Benjamin Sesko, the 84-year-old appears impressed with the club's other key signings. He repeated his admiration for Lammens, Cunha and Mbeumo last month.",
      "\"I think the appointment of the goalkeeper has made a difference,\" Ferguson told Press Box PR. \"He's young at 23, he's quick, a big lad, good feet and hands, and I think that helps.",
      "\"I think they have needed that player. United have always had inspirational players over the years. I think that has helped. The other two, Mbeumo and Cunha, they look as if they will contribute to the recovery of our form.\"",
      "United are currently sixth in the table, matching Chelsea on points and trailing fourth-placed Liverpool by three. However, Ferguson has previously argued that there is no instant solution to turn United back into title contenders.",
      "\"He (Amorim) is a good personality, it is not easy,\" Ferguson said to Press Box PR. \"I remember looking back on my own time there, starting off when Liverpool were the bee's knees. They were a fantastic club winning the European Cup four times and all that, but then it took them 31 years to win the league again.",
      "\"We are now in the same situation. It could be 10 years, could be 11 years, because of that cycle. It has to be thought out carefully and we have to make sure the recruitment is going to be better than what it was.\"",

      "Amorim's future as United boss was thrown into doubt after Sunday's 1-1 draw at Leeds - with the Portuguese suggesting that he might leave when his contract ends in 18 months. The ex-Sporting man insisted on being recognised as the manager at Old Trafford - rather than the head coach - despite the latter being his official title since his appointment by Ineos in November 2024.",
      "Now, Ineos have decided to end the Amorim project - sacking him after a 14-month tenure at M16. The club issued a statement confirming his dismissal, expressing hope that their change will boost their performance in the Premier League this season with European football still a clear possibility, once again.",
      "And it was reported in October last year - when Amorim was still in charge - former England manager Southgate was debating whether to throw his hat in the ring for the managerial position at Old Trafford.",
      "However, it was suggested Southgate would hold reservations about taking up the job and would demand four years to turn the tide, which the board may not be willing to give him, or anyone. As per The Sun, sources suggested that the boyhood United fan would need assurance that the top brass would stick to any longer-term goals planned.",
      "The publication also claimed that Southgate harbours concerns that the board would demand instant success from him, while he takes an approach centred around gradual success over a prolonged period. The 55-year-old has been out of work since stepping down as England manager after guiding the Three Lions to a runners-up place at Euro 2024 - losing 2-1 to Spain in the final.",
      "Southgate is not the only manager who has been linked with succeeding Amorim. Palace's boss Oliver Glasner and Brighton's Fabian Hurzeler have been rumoured as favourites to make the move to Old Trafford. Real Madrid legend Zinedine Zidane and Barcelona icon Xavi Hernandez have also seen their names tossed into the mix.",
      "Announcing Amorim's departure in a statement on Monday, United said: \"Ruben Amorim has departed his role as head coach of Manchester United. Ruben was appointed in November 2024 and he led the team to a UEFA Europa League Final in Bilbao in May.",

      "Following the sacking of Ruben Amorim, Sir Jim Ratcliffe has a massive decision to make. There have been glimpses of encouragement from Manchester United this season, but a run of underwhelming performances and results - coupled with a breakdown in the relationship between manager and owners - has resulted Amorim being relieved of his duties after only 14 months at the helm.",
      "Focus has already shifted to who will replace the 40-year-old. United are unlikely to struggle for interest in the vacancy, but one name Ratcliffe has openly admired in the past could be extremely difficult to lure.",
      "That man is Jurgen Klopp, who famously guided Liverpool to Premier League and Champions League glory. Ratcliffe has spoken glowingly about the German in the past,- suggesting that Klopp would represent something of a dream appointment.",
      "\"Klopp has this ability to drive his players to a frenzy,\" he said back in March 2024, shortly after taking over footballing operations at Old Trafford. \"Total commitment on the pitch. And, you know, that's one of the things a good coach can do.\"",
      "Klopp is now working as Head of Global Soccer at Red Bull, a role he accepted soon after stepping away from Liverpool at the conclusion of the 2023/24 season.",
      "He has made it clear before that his spell at Anfield would be his final job in management. When that stance is combined with the bitter rivalry between Liverpool and United, a switch to Old Trafford looks highly improbable.",
      "As a result, United are expected to pursue alternative and more attainable options. Crystal Palace manager Oliver Glasner is believed to be high on the shortlist, while former England boss Gareth Southgate - another long-time favourite of Ratcliffe - is also under consideration.",
      "Bournemouth head coach Andoni Iraola, Aston Villa's Unai Emery and ex-United defender Laurent Blanc have also been mentioned as possibilities. In the short term, however, U-18s coach Darren Fletcher has been placed in temporary charge until a permanent appointment is made.",
      "United announced Amorim's exit in a statement released on Monday morning. \"Ruben Amorim has departed his role as Head Coach of Manchester United,\" the statement read.",
      "\"Ruben was appointed in November 2024 and led the team to a UEFA Europa League Final in Bilbao in May. With Manchester United sitting sixth in the Premier League, the club's leadership has reluctantly made the decision that it is the right time to make a change.",
      "\"This will give the team the best opportunity of the highest possible Premier League finish. The club would like to thank Ruben for his contribution to the club and wishes him well for the future. Darren Fletcher will take charge of the team against Burnley on Wednesday.\"",
      "The decision comes after United were held to a 1-1 draw by Leeds at Elland Road on Sunday. In his post-match comments, the 40-year-old alluded to internal issues, stressing that he viewed himself as United's \"manager\" rather than merely a \"coach\".",
      "\"It's going to be like this for 18 months or when the board decide to change,\" Amorim said. \"That was my point, I want to finish with that. I'm not going to quit. I will do my job until another guy is coming here to replace me.\"",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Former Benfica star Nuno Gomes met with Ruben Amorim after the Manchester derby in September and believes Amorim will one day take charge of the Lisbon club. Amorim has been sacked by Manchester United with the club in sixth place in the Premier League, with the move confirmed on Monday morning.",
      "At the time of the meeting, Benfica's manager Bruno Lage found himself days away from the sack. Lage would depart just days after United lost 3-0 to Manchester City, with Jose Mourinho taking his place in the dugout.",
      "Amorim wasn't the only Premier League figure who met with Gomes, a candidate for Benfica's vice presidency and former Portugal international. Manchester City sporting director Hugo Viana was also in attendance, with Gomes sharing more details of the meeting in the autumn.",
      "\"I am friends with Ruben Amorim and Hugo Viana,\" Gomes told Now (via A Bola). \"We took advantage of this match and the fact that we were going to meet with Pedro Ferreira to get to know people from Manchester City and Manchester United, to understand how those clubs operate. I had dinner with Hugo Viana and Ruben Amorim, just the three of us.\"",
      "Gomes stressed at the time that there had been no formal invitation for Amorim to take over at Benfica at the time, with the club recognising he was very much United's man at the time. However, he caught Gomes' eye long before winning his two league titles as manager of Benfica's rivals Sporting CP.",
      "During a campaign event for presidential candidate Noronha Lopes in September, Gomes said he was certain Amorim would take over at Benfica \"one day,\" and reiterated those feelings in his Now interview.",
      "\"I am convinced that Ruben Amorim will one day be Benfica's coach. It didn't happen sooner because, after a few meetings, Amorim decided not to accept those conditions while he was at Casa Pia. I was the one who recommended him at the time,\" Gomes said of the 40-year-old, who also won three league titles as a player at Estadio da Luz and turned down an opportunity to take charge of Benfica's B team.",
      "\"Ruben Amorim is a person with very strong convictions. We know how he communicates, works and prepares his teams. When he was at Sporting, we all realised that Amorim is stubborn. At the end of last season, he was in a different situation than he is now at United. I don’t know, but it may have crossed his mind to abandon a project that was difficult to bring to fruition.",
      "\"He may have gone through phases where he was more discouraged and had thoughts of slamming the door and leaving. Then, suddenly, he wakes up with the confidence that he will get the team playing well.\"",
      "Lage was sacked by Benfica in September after a Champions League loss to Qarabag, but things have eventually picked up under Mourinho. They're just one point shy of a place in the Champions League play-off round and just three adrift of second-placed Sporting in the league.",
      "Amorim will now have a decision to make on his return after United brought his tenure to an end after less than 14 months. As for the Premier League club themselves, Darren Fletcher will take temporary charge against Burnley in midweek.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Manchester United have been told they must pay a staggering compensation clause if they want to make Eddie Howe their new manager.",

      "United have taken immediate action after the 1-1 draw at Elland Road, sacking Amorim after 14 months in charge. Former United midfielder Darren Fletcher, who is currently the under-18s coach, will take charge of the team for their Premier League game against Burnley on Wednesday night.",
      "Attention has already swiftly turned to who could replace Amorim. Crystal Palace boss Oliver Glasner emerged as the early favourite with bookmakers, while former England boss Gareth Southgate was 5/1 in the early betting.",
      "Howe, the Newcastle United manager, has been linked with the job in the past and is understood to have admirers still at Old Trafford. Newcastle, however, have moved to protect themselves in case of a move for the 48-year-old.",
      "With Howe believed to be earning approximately £6m annually and having a minimum of three years remaining on his existing contract, any potential suitor would need to fork out a massive eight-figure sum to secure his release. This doesn't even factor in the substantial cost required to tempt away Howe's trusted backroom staff including Jason Tindall, Steve Purchess and Simon Weatherstone.",
      "When Amorim's role came under scrutiny back in October, Chronicle Live questioned Howe about his dedication to the Tyneside club.",
      "\"I'm all in (at Newcastle),\" Howe declared when quizzed about connections to the Manchester United position in October . \"My commitment here is 100% here and always has been. My family is still here, and we are fighting every day to make a success of what we are doing.",
      "\"The season ahead could be a wonderful thing, and that is what we are trying to focus on, trying to make a success of the games we have coming up.\"",
      "Mirror Sport believes that Newcastle received no formal approach from Chelsea regarding Howe, whilst Liam Rosenior prepares to assume control of the Blues following his arrival from partner club Strasbourg. Magpies chiefs will also fight tooth and nail to keep the manager at St James' Park.",
      "Sporting director Ross Wilson said: \"We have got an outstanding manager here, and from past experience, I'd certainly rather have one that other people might like rather than one that nobody likes.\"",
      "Howe had been touted for the England position in 2024 before Thomas Tuchel got the nod. The FA didn't pursue their interest despite widespread speculation following Gareth Southgate's departure.",
      "Reports from Germany suggest that Tuchel will step down from the England role after the World Cup, irrespective of how things pan out in the US. Whether Howe's name enters the frame for the international position at Wembley once more is yet to be determined.",
      "For the time being though, the head coach sees his future firmly planted in the dugout on Tyneside. Consecutive victories have silenced doubters, with Howe describing the coming weeks as crucial.",
      "Newcastle's destiny in both the Carabao Cup and FA Cup will be determined whilst they face their final two Champions League group stage fixtures against PSV Eindhoven and Paris St-Germain, hoping to secure either direct qualification or a play-off spot come spring.",

      "Manchester United legend Rio Ferdinand says he is not surprised by the club's decision to sack Ruben Amorim given the Portuguese's record. He also revealed that a recent visit to the training ground gave him the impression that the manager's days were numbered.",
      "The Red Devils confirmed on Monday morning that they had decided to part ways with the 40-year-old, despite a noticeable improvement in their performances at Old Trafford. The club issued a statement saying: \"Ruben Amorim has departed his role as Head Coach of Manchester United.",
      "\"Ruben was appointed in November 2024 and led the team to a UEFA Europa League Final in Bilbao in May. With Manchester United currently sixth in the Premier League, the club's leadership has reluctantly decided that it is the right time for a change.",
      "\"This will give the team the best chance of achieving the highest possible Premier League finish. The club would like to thank Ruben for his contribution to the club and wishes him well for the future. Darren Fletcher will take charge of the team against Burnley on Wednesday.",
      "In response to the news, Ferdinand explained that while he was slightly caught unaware by the timing, Amorim's record speaks for itself. Speaking on his Rio Ferdinand Presents YouTube channel, he said: \"They have sacked him, they have sacked him!\"",
      "He added: \"I didn't anticipate this when I woke up this morning that Ruben Amorim would be getting the sack. He was not in the four or five managers I thought would be getting the sack next.",
      "\"I am surprised but when you look at his record, in black and white, I'm not surprised. I think that has been definitive and the reason it's been so sharp overnight [speaking out]. Two managers have spoken out against the hierarchy now and been sacked immediately. But his record is the worst of any United manager since Sir Alex Ferguson.\"",
      "Ferdinand highlighted recent training ground visit sparked concerns that the head coach's time at Old Trafford was drawing to a close. He added: \"I saw his last two press conferences and was thinking something isn't right here.",
      "\"This guy's best trait and one of the most likeable things about him has been his ability to be quite punchy and upbeat in his press conferences. He had quite a jovial way about himself. The last two he did looked depressing. I didn't say it because I get the ability to go into the training ground and see people and whatnot at times.",
      "\"The last time I went there to interview Bruno [Fernandes], I saw the manager and we had a little chat for five or 10 minutes. He's [usually] warm, he spends time with you, he's an open book. When I went there the last time, I noticed immediately that there was a coldness about him. There was a real difference to what I'd seen before.",
      "\"Now I look back with hindsight, things were starting to cook before Christmas. This isn't just an overnight thing, I don't think, in terms of his dialogue with the hierarchy and the way he's been feeling about things. I felt this coldness that we've seen in the last two press conferences. I saw it in him.",
      "\"The training ground felt good and the vibe around the players. But he just felt a little bit distant. When I saw him last time he was a very different human being. I was thinking it was the wear and tear of a long, hard season and the pressure was getting to him a little bit, maybe he'd woken up on the wrong side of the bed. But now, looking back, this has been cooking before Christmas. One hundred per cent.\"",
      "After the match at Elland Road, Amorim said: \"I came here to be the manager of Manchester United, not to be the coach of Manchester United. That is clear.",
      "\"I know that my name is not [Thomas] Tuchel, it's not [Antonio] Conte, it's not [Jose] Mourinho, but I'm the manager of Manchester United. And it's going to be like this for 18 months or when the board decides to change. I'm not going to quit. I will do my job until another guy is coming here to replace me.\"",
      "Following Amorim's departure, Fletcher will step up to oversee the first-team for Wednesday's Premier League fixture against Burnley. It remains unclear at this stage whether the club will persist with the U18s boss for the remainder of the campaign, or whether they'll bring in a more seasoned top flight manager.",

The Austrian's comments earlier on this season suggested that United had turned a corner under the guidance of the Portuguese head coach - but his departure now says otherwise.",
      "United endured a torrid calendar year of 2025, finishing the season in 15th position, claiming just 42 points in the Premier League, winning nine games - their worst return in the competition's history. However, this term, they've claimed 31 points from 20 games and are knocking on the door of the European places.",
      "Things had certainly improved in terms of points return, but performances have been poor with United struggling to adapt to Amorim's 3-4-3 system. A draw with relegation strugglers Wolves and a point at Elland Road last weekend saw Amorim explode in his post-match press conference taking aim at the club's hierarchy and former player Gary Neville.",
      "United released a statement confirming the decision to sack the Portuguese coach, making it clear they want to finish the season as high as possible.",
      "Glasner, who has won the FA Cup and Community Shield in recent months with the Eagles, is among those to be linked with the vacant managerial position and plays a similar system to outgoing boss Amorim.",
      "Speaking earlier this season about United's system under the Portuguese head coach, Glasner defended Amorim pointing to the team's underlying numbers.",
      "\"It's really funny talking about the 3-4-3 system, and I think United have the highest xG in the Premier League for scoring goals,\" Glasner said back in November.",
      "\"Their team has changed. Especially in attack. They needed more goals and invested £200m - buying three players up front.",
      "\"Also, now they have players who can play very intense like [Bryan] Mbeumo. For me, that's impressive to see. We compared it [their last meeting] to where they are now.",
      "\"I think their work-rate is much higher than it was last year and then they get the reward.\"",

      "\"We're playing the same system,\" Glasner said earlier this season when explaining the benefits of lining up in a 3-4-3.",
      "\"So it looks like it's a good attacking system. Also, as we show it, you can have a good defensive structure with it.",
      "\"It's all about what you do with the system and how fluid you are in attack and how creative you are.\"",

      "United released a statement on Monday morning to explain that the Portuguese boss had been relieved of his duties with immediate effect, with under-18s coach Darren Fletcher taking over as interim manager.

He was left out of the squad for United’s 2-0 win over Aston Villa on the final day of the season and told he was not in Amorim’s plans for the 2025/26 campaign.",

The Portuguese boss, who was sacked from Old Trafford on Monday morning, left Sporting last November to replace Erik ten Hag in an exit that resulted in Goncalves having to say goodbye to an individual he described as \"like a father\" to the squad.",
      "Speaking last year in an interview with Canal 11, the 27-year-old heaped significant praise on Amorim for the role he played in his career, as he said: \"I wouldn't be here today [without him].",
      "\"We had a very strong bond, both professionally and personally. He liked my wife very much and was concerned about my well-being, both on the field and in my family life. He knew when players were happy or sad, and he knew exactly what to say.",
      "\"We were sad. I started crying because I really liked him, and I was sad. I never told him not to go; I wished him good luck. The players understood. He was like a father to us. We were sad, but we understood. I wish him the best of luck.\"",
      "Opening up on the repercussions Amorim's exit had on Sporting, Goncalves added: \"We were left without a coach, without a captain, without the forward, Paulinho, who gave us a lot and scored many decisive goals, plus Adan, who was an experienced goalkeeper.",
      "\"In the middle of the season, we felt we were missing some leadership. The team united, and it went well. Everyone tried to lead, and Morten started to emerge.\" Amorim's reign in Manchester lasted just 14 months, with his last game in charge being an uninspiring 1-1 draw away to Leeds United on Sunday.",

      "United said in a statement issued on Monday morning that the Portuguese, who took charge in November 2024, had left the role, with the club’s leadership having “reluctantly made the decision that it is the right time to make a change”. The club added in the statement: “This will give the team the best opportunity of the highest possible Premier League finish.”",
      "Many have been left shocked by the decision, and it has not taken long for Alalshikh to offer his verdict. Rather than sharing a few words about the departed boss, the 44-year-old instead opted to throw a cheeky verbal jab at the Glazers. Taking to social media, he wrote: \"Praise be to God … finally … may the Glazer [family] follow soon.\"",
      "Alalshikh has become a prominent figure in the world of boxing, bringing several world class fights to Saudi Arabia. That said, he does boast a glittering CV across other sports. He owned Spanish football club Almeria from 2019 until earlier this year, as well as owning Egyptian club Pyramids FC between 2018 and 2019.",

      "Back in September, reports emerged that he was reportedly preparing a bid to buy Championship side Bristol City. Alalshikh has grabbed the headlines over the last few months, but not because of his escapades in the world of boxing. In October, the 44-year-old sent United fans into frenzy after claiming a takeover for the club was at an advanced stage.",
      "Posting on his X account, he declared: \"The best news I heard today is that Manchester United is now in an advanced stage of completing a deal to sell to a new investor. I hope he's better than the previous owners.\" The post emerged merely hours after an interview with United co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe was published, in which he offered no hint of plans to surrender control at Old Trafford.",
      "Amid confusion, Alalshikh later clarified that he wasn't the potential investor, stating: \"Yesterday's post about Manchester United's potential sale meant one thing: the club is in an advanced negotiation phase with a new investor. Just to clarify, I am not the investor, nor are they from my nation. I'm posting this as a fan who wishes the deal to happen, though it might not necessarily happen.\"",
      "Not long after his comments, United officials were left confused by Alalshikh's posts online, claiming that the report were 'news to them'. The Times' Charlotte Duncker later revealed how Ratcliffe could be left with no option if the Glazers decided to sell the club. \"I think for the right price, they definitely would. There is a clause within Ratcliffe's agreement when he bought the club - I think it was triggered in August this year - that meant if the right offer came in - and I think that it was over something like $33 a share - that the Glazers could sell the whole club.",
      "\"Not just their portion of it, but Sir Ratcliffe will be bought out, as well, so there is potential that the Glazers could sell the entire club but, at the minute, it just seems like a strange one with this news, this hype and this excitement that's been triggered by this one tweet.\"",
      "The Glazer family have endured some harsh criticism from fans over the millions of dollars of debt accrued since their takeover two decades ago. That said, they have maintained a majority stake in the club. In 2024, British billionaire Sir Jim Ratcliffe finalised a deal to purchase a 27.7 per cent stake in the club - valued at approximately $1.6billion (£1.25bn). As well as the agreement, Ratcliffe assumed control of football operations, assisted by Jason Wilcox and Omar Berrada.",

      "Tyson Fury gave up watching Manchester United during Ruben Amorim's leadership after admitting that the Premier League giants were 's***.'",
      "The former two-time heavyweight world champion grew up watching the Red Devils triumph across all competitions, and has visited Old Trafford countless times. However, since Sir Alex Ferguson's departure in 2013, the club have endured a tough period.",
      "United have only picked up five major titles since Ferguson left the club, but have failed to pick up a league title in over a decade. The top outfit showed signs of a potential resurgence under Dutchman Erik ten Hag after the Red Devils scored a stunning 2-1 FA Cup final victory over noisy neighbours Manchester City in May 2024 - despite their torrid league finish.",
      "However, the club failed to push on. Five months later, Ten Hag was out of the job, and was quickly replaced by Amorim. The ex-Sporting Lisbon manager was highly-rated by many across teams in Europe, but failed to became a fan-favourite at Old Trafford. The club finished 15th in the table last season, as well as suffering an agonising defeat to Tottenham Hotspur in the Europa League final.",
      "All Out Fighting is your one-stop shop for all things boxing and MMA, two of the world’s most popular sports - from exclusive interviews, to insight from the biggest world title fights and the most bizarre influencer bouts. Visit www.alloutfighting.com for more!",
      "Amid their downfall, Fury has well and truly given up on the Red Devils altogether due to Amorim’s stuttering tenure. Instead, the 'Gypsy King's' loyalties now lie with horse racing. The 37-year-old much favours a day at the races as opposed to watching his football team suffer.",
      "Back in August, the Morecambe brawler spent Bank Holiday Monday at Cartmel, where two of his horses were running. At the time of speaking, United were 16th in the league table after a torrid start to the new Premier League campaign. \"I'm not a supporter of football really,\" he admitted. \"I used to support United but because they're in the s*** now I'm no supporter of any football teams anymore. I used to support England as well but when they lost to Iceland in the Euros in 2016 that was me and football completely done with. Now I'm into horse racing, get up!\"",
      "Since the interview, though, things have started to get slightly better for the Manchester giants. The club currently sit sixth in the league, just three points behind fourth placed Liverpool. Not only that, Fury may now decide to give up horse racing and switch his allegiances to football once again after the Red Devils confirmed the sacking of Amorim on Monday morning.",
      "Following the club's 1-1 draw with Leeds on Sunday, Amorim sent a rather blunt message to the board in his post-match press conference, and has since been dismissed. Former United midfielder Darren Fletcher - who currently manages the under-18s - is expected to take charge of the first time side for their game against Burnley on Wednesday night.",
      "The decision has been made by chief executive Omar Berrada and director of football Jason Wilcox. The Athletic reports that the Manchester outfit could leave Fletcher in charge as interim manager until the end of the current campaign, before appointing a full-time replacement. A statement from United read: \"Ruben Amorim has departed his role as Head Coach of Manchester United. Ruben was appointed in November 2024 and led the team to a UEFA Europa League Final in Bilbao in May.",
      "\"With Manchester United sitting sixth in the Premier League, the club’s leadership has reluctantly made the decision that it is the right time to make a change. This will give the team the best opportunity of the highest possible Premier League finish. The club would like to thank Ruben for his contribution to the club and wishes him well for the future. Darren Fletcher will take charge of the team against Burnley on Wednesday.\"",
      "When asked on Sunday whether he had confidence from the United board, Amorim sensationally hit back, replying: \"Guys, to stop with that, and I noticed that you received selective information about everything. I came here to be the manager of Manchester United, not to be the coach of Manchester United. That is clear,\" he said.",
      "\"I know that my name is not Tuchel, is not Conte, is not Mourinho, but I'm the manager of Manchester United. It's going to be like this for 18 months or when the board decided to change. That was my point. I want to finish with that. I'm not going to quit. I will do my job until other guy is coming here to replace me. I just want to say that I'm going to be the manager of this team, not just the coach. I was really clear on that. That is going to finish in 18 months, and then everyone is going to move on.",
      "\"That was the deal. That is my job, not to be a coach. If people cannot handle the Gary Nevilles and the criticises of everything, we need to change the club. No, no guys, I would say that I came here to be the manager of Manchester United, not to be the coach. Every department, the scouting department, the sport director needs to do their job. I will do mine for 18 months and then we move on. Thank you, guys.\"",

      "Ruben Amorim has been sacked, and Manchester United are back in the market for a new manager. Just hours after stating that he will not walk away from his role, Amorim has been handed his marching orders.",
      "Following the draw with Leeds United, it was clear that relationships were frosty behind the scenes at Old Trafford. The Portuguese boss declared he arrived at the club wanting to manage and not simply coach.",
      "\"I came here to be the manager of Manchester United, not to be the coach of Manchester United. That is clear,\" Amorim told reporters. \"I know that my name is not [Thomas] Tuchel, it's not [Antonio] Conte, it's not [Jose] Mourinho, but I'm the manager of Manchester United.",

      "The former Manchester United midfielder will be in charge against Burnley, stepping up from his role with the club's academy. It's not impossible to think that Fletcher could take on the job until the end of the season if he does well.",
      "Another former Manchester United midfielder, and crucially, he is available. The 44-year-old departed Middlesbrough last year and has since been working with UEFA, but perhaps could provide a fast option to lead the club on a temporary basis.",
      "Carrick has filled in as caretaker manager before, has a stature that demands respect, and knows the club better than most.",
      "The former England boss' name is bound to crop up with United co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe being a fan. Sporting director Jason Wilcox is also said to respect the work of Southgate, but United did go in another direction in appointing Amorim in the first place.",
      "Southgate, of course, is currently available but has not managed in club football for more than 16 years.",
      "Perhaps an unlikely option given his connection to Manchester City, but a newly available figure who has previously coached rather than managed. The Italian is said to have been discontent with the control exerted over him at Stamford Bridge before his exit, so the details would have to be fine-tuned, however.",
      "The Bournemouth coach is only under contract until the summer and has completed an impressive job on the south coast. Iraola has dealt with a squad that has seen plenty of change occur outside of his control and still ensured the Cherries remain competitive.",
      "Another coach whose contract is dwindling. Glasner guided Crystal Palace to their first trophy last term, but ultimately ended up frustrated with their efforts in the transfer market.",
      "The Austrian, like Iraola, could provide a solid option with Premier League experience if United can hang on until the end of the season to make their move.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Ruben Amorim has left Manchester United following his forthright comments after the stalemate with Leeds United on Sunday. The Portuguese manager's comments cast doubt over his position, and this time United's higher-ups decided enough was enough.",
      "\"With Manchester United sitting sixth in the Premier League, the club’s leadership has reluctantly made the decision that it is the right time to make a change,\" United said in a statement. \"This will give the team the best opportunity of the highest possible Premier League finish.",
      "\"The club would like to thank Ruben for his contribution to the club and wishes him well for the future. Darren Fletcher will take charge of the team against Burnley on Wednesday.\"",
      "While results have been underwhelming at times, Amorim's comments have also attracted plenty of scrutiny. Things came to a head after the 1-1 draw at Elland Road, in what would prove to be his final post-match outburst as the man in charge at Old Trafford.",
      "\"I came here to be the manager of Manchester United, not to be the coach of Manchester United. That is clear,\" Amorim told reporters.",
      "\"I know that my name is not [Thomas] Tuchel, it's not [Antonio] Conte, it's not [Jose] Mourinho, but I'm the manager of Manchester United. And it's going to be like this for 18 months or when the board decides to change. I'm not going to quit. I will do my job until another guy is coming here to replace me.\"",
      "We've seen before that a tirade from the boss hasn't always sparked action from up high, including early on when significant pressure surrounded Amorim during his debut season as he made a slow start after succeeding Erik ten Hag. \"I know that if we don't win, regardless if they pay the buyout or not, every manager is in danger,\" he acknowledged in December 2024.",
      "The subsequent month, whilst not explicitly suggesting resignation, he recognised the decline since taking over from Erik ten Hag in the technical area. \"In ten games in the Premier League, we won two,\" he acknowledged following a loss to Brighton.",
      "\"Imagine what this is for a fan of Manchester United. Imagine what this is for me. We are getting a new coach that is losing more than the last coach. I have full knowledge of that.",
      "\"We are being the worst team maybe in the history of Manchester United. I know that you want headlines, but I'm saying that because we have to acknowledge that and to change that. Here you go, your headlines.\"",
      "A solid Europa League run took United within 90 minutes of a trophy in Amorim's first season, and victory in the final could have compensated for domestic woes. However, when United were defeated by Spurs in Bilbao, the manager said he was willing to walk away the very next day if that's what the board desired.",
      "\"In this moment, I am not going to be here defending myself, [it] is not my style,\" he said. \"I cannot do it, is really hard for me. So I have nothing to show to the fans to say I am going to improve because of this, I had these problems, I will not do nothing.",
      "\"In this moment, it's a little bit of faith. So let's see. Like I said before, coming here before in the flash, I am always open. If the board and fans feel that I'm not the right guy, I will go the next day without any conversation about compensation.",
      "\"But I will not quit again. I am really confident in my job and, as you can see, I will not change nothing in the way I do things.\"",
      "United splashed out over the summer, spending more than £200m on Benjamin Sesko, Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Senne Lammens. However, just weeks into the new season, he was once again hinting at a change in the United dugout after a dismal Carabao Cup defeat to Grimsby Town.",
      "\"We played badly for 30 minutes against Fulham. And then that kind of performance, I was really disappointed with everything,\" Amorim said. \"But now it's a new game and I'm focused on the next one.",
      "\"If you are in one way, if you have this kind of behaviour, you have to understand that you have things that is good on that type of behaviour, that you have the other side of the coin. So I understand that.",
      "\"And again, sometimes I want to quit, sometimes I want to be here for 20 years, sometimes I love to be with my players, sometimes I don't want to be with them. So, again, I need to improve on that. It's going to be hard. But now I'm good with the next one.\"",
      "He made no apologies for his feelings, stating: \"I'm going to say that sometimes I hate my players, sometimes I love my players, sometimes I want to defend my players.",
      "\"I think this is my way of doing things and I'm going to be like that. And I felt that in that moment I was so frustrated and [annoyed]. And I know, again, that you have a lot of experienced people talking about the way I should perform with the media, to be more constant, to be more calm. I'm not going to be like that.",
      "\"So I'm trying to accept that and I'm going to be who I am. That's why I have the passion that I have.\"",
      "Amorim's recent remarks have elicited a reaction from Gary Neville, who has observed a shift in the Portuguese manager's attitude of late. \"Something has happened in the last week which means that Amorim is starting to unleash a little bit,\" the former United captain said on the Gary Neville podcast.",
      "\"It looks to me that he is not happy with something in the hierarchy. Obviously something is annoying him - he's obviously not feeling the support. He's obviously letting go.",
      "\"When you say that you came to the club as a manager, I thought he was appointed as the head coach and quite clearly appointed to coach the team.\"",
      "It was clear during Amorim's brief tenure that he was not afraid to risk his position. However, the post-Leeds comments proved to be one challenge too many.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "A club statement read: \"Ruben Amorim has departed his role as Head Coach of Manchester United. Ruben was appointed in November 2024 and led the team to a UEFA Europa League Final in Bilbao in May.",

      "Amorim was appointed as Erik ten Hag's permanent replacement at United in November 2024 after Ruud van Nistelrooy enjoyed a successful four-game reign as interim head coach.",
      "The former Sporting CP boss signed a two-and-a-half year deal at Old Trafford and made a fast start to life at the Red Devils, winning two of his opening three matches in charge.",
      "However, United's form ebbed and flowed from that point on, with the Red Devils progressing in the Europa League but faltering in the Premier League. Indeed, Amorim's side dropped into the bottom half in the top flight and ended up finishing 15th - their lowest-ever finish in 50 years.",
      "But, after United reached the Europa League final, Amorim kept his job and was backed in the summer with the club's board spending more than £200million on new players. Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko were the three high-profile players that arrived through the doors.",
      "Although United's Premier League form has improved this season, winning eight and drawing seven of their 20 top-flight fixtures, it hasn't been enough for Amorim to keep his position.",

      "It was in October that Sir Jim Ratcliffe said he wanted to give Ruben Amorim three years to prove he is a \"great coach\". In the end, he didn't even get another three months. The man appointed as Manchester United's first head coach was sacked less than 19 hours after demanding to be the manager instead.",
      "What happened at Leeds looks to have been the final straw but conflict has been building for weeks, if not months. Amorim entered his press conference on Friday with a face like thunder and that stemmed from a meeting with director of football Jason Wilcox earlier that day in which there was a clash between the pair.",
      "United's football structure had expected Amorim to adapt from his 3-4-2-1 system as the players became more settled but officials were starting to sense that the Portuguese head coach was never going to do that. In Friday's meeting, Amorim again reacted angrily when his system was raised.",
      "Amorim then poured fuel on the fire by refusing to answer questions as to why he had recently said he wouldn't get the \"time or money\" to play a \"perfect 3-4-3\".",
      "But United never promised him the cash to rebuild the squad in his image. When Amorim was approached to take over in November last year, it was agreed he would play his system at the start, with the team seen to be lacking a structure under former boss Erik ten Hag.",
      "The end of the Dutchman's reign had been characterised by end-to-end games with no control and the board felt Amorim's set-up could alleviate some of those issues. But it was agreed from the outset that he would adapt once he had his feet under the table.",
      "By Friday evening, club bosses had come to the conclusion he was never going to do so and felt they had no option but to make a change, with some fearing a slide down the table given the level of performances.",
      "It wasn't solely about Amorim moving from a back five to a back four, but more about the lack of an attacking evolution under the 40-year-old. His style of play has been passive and bland, and the draw with Wolves between Christmas and New Year went down particularly badly with the hierarchy at Old Trafford.",
      "Supporters demanded more attacking intent within that game but with the scores level Amorim replaced Ayden Heaven with Leny Yoro. It was the kind of negative substitution that came to define his reign.",
      "The club had also been unimpressed with some of Amorim's comments in his media dealings. The criticisms of the academy and namechecking Harry Amass and Chido Obi went down particularly badly, but first-team players weren't immune either.",
      "There was disappointment internally at some veiled criticism of Benjamin Sesko earlier in the season, as well as the reference to the anxiety felt when Patrick Dorgu had the ball back in November.",
      "Those issues contributed to the decision to sack Amorim on Monday morning, with Wilcox and chief executive Omar Berrada delivering the news personally. Although club chiefs have denied talk of a rift, it is clear there was conflict and this was a stunning breakdown in relations that left United's hierarchy with little choice but to axe a man they have all staked their reputations on in one way or another.",
      "Even when Ratcliffe made those comments in October, tensions were beginning to creep into working relationships at Carrington. Faith had ebbed away in Amorim's back three system and some of his emotional outbursts, particularly after games, weren't seen as being helpful.",
      "For Amorim's part, he was starting to show signs of frustration at working in a collaborative structure that didn't give him the power he craved. A £230million summer spending spree focused on players who could fit a back three or a back four, rather than signing specialists for the very particular roles in his system.",
      "If there was tension around transfers, that went both ways. Kobbie Mainoo has become a sticking point between Amorim and the structure around him. United were loath to lose another academy graduate, especially a player seen as one of the best to emerge at the club in recent years.",
      "But Amorim has made it clear he doesn't see Mainoo fitting into his 3-4-2-1 shape. He was tried as a No.10 last season, but the summer spending spree on attackers left him well down the pecking order there. The head coach harboured doubts about Mainoo's defensive work, particularly off the ball, and was reluctant to play him as one of the two deeper midfielders.",
      "This left United in a bind. Mainoo wanted to sign for Napoli on loan on deadline day but there was not enough time to bring in a replacement. United officials were also conscious of the optics of letting him go. But Amorim refused to hand him opportunities and Mainoo hasn't started a single Premier League game this season.",
      "The 20-year-old won't mourn the departure of his head coach and he looks certain to stay at Old Trafford now, rather than seek a temporary departure this month. He might also find chances easier to come by in a three-man midfield, a tactical approach Amorim refused to get on board with.",
      "There were concerns last season that his unique system wasn't translating to the Premier League and was too predictable. Those became sharper internally after the draw with Fulham earlier this season, when director of recruitment Christopher Vivell shared comments from Fulham boss Marco Silva that detailed how easy it was to prepare to face Amorim's United.",
      "When Rob Edwards made similar comments after the draw with Wolves last week, it set alarm bells ringing once again, particularly as that return to a back three came after Amorim had briefly considered a peace accord with Wilcox and co.",
      "His bosses had urged him to be more tactically adaptable and he duly played 4-3-3 against Newcastle on Boxing Day. It was a game from which conclusions were hard to draw, with United looking good in the first half and then hanging on in the second.",
      "Amorim had seen enough, however. He abandoned the flirtation with changing his system and decided if he was going down, it would be on his own sword. He had had enough of the interference from above and stuck to his own principles, with that tactical clash leading to some of the emotion he has shown in recent weeks.",
      "There was also conflict over transfers. United has sought to introduce a more integrated approach to recruitment since the Ineos takeover, but it has left Amorim unable to secure the players he really wanted. There was some tension of the identity of the striker signed in the summer, with United opting to move for Sesko, despite having a similar profile to Rasmus Hojlund.",
      "Those signings were players who United felt could play in a number of roles, but Amorim was sticking to his tactical guns rather than adapting as had been agreed.",
      "When he was asked about recruitment recently, he hinted that he and Wilcox didn't always agree but that every club should listen to the manager, because they know the style of play.",
      "Ultimately, Amorim's style of play wasn't winning anyone over at United, and his stubbornness eventually proved too much.",

Amorim's strained relationship with director of football Jason Wilcox has been brought into the open by the 40-year-old in recent weeks and his outburst on Sunday has proved to be the final straw.",
      "The Portuguese was informed on Monday morning that he was being sacked and he leaves the club with immediate affect. He departs with a record of just 24 wins in 63 games. The decision to dispense with the services of Amorim was taken by United's leadership team, including Wilcox and chief excecutive Omar Berrada.",
      "It had been on the cards since the former Sporting boss used the final question of his post-match press conference on Sunday to fire a stunnig broadside at the club, accusing them of a smear campaign against him and demanding more power. \"Guys, to stop with that, I noticed that you receive selective information about everything,\" he said.",

No, guys, I just want to say that I came here to be the manager of Manchester United, not to be the coach. And every department, the scouting department, the sports director needs to do their job.

      "Amorim was sacked on Monday morning, less than 19 hours after a remarkable press conference at Elland Road in which he demanded more power and told director of football Jason Wilcox to \"do his job\". Tensions between Amorim and members of the football leadership team, including Wilcox and director of recruitment Christopher Vivell, have become public in recent weeks and Amorim laid them bare at Elland Road.",
      "His stunning remarks left nobody in any doubt that were issues behind the scenes at Old Trafford. Amorim's job came under immediate scrutiny and after what was essentially a 'back me or sack me' plea, his 63-game reign was brought to an end on Monday.",
      "But United sources insist that the decision was made solely on results and denied there had been any power struggles or that Amorim had laid down an ultimatum demanding more power. They insist the 40-year-old maintained the 'unwavering support' of everyone within the club but there hadn't been enough progress for him to continue in the role.",
      "Amorim had been frustrated at being told there was no money to spend in January and was keen to add a midfielder to his squad, with United initially showing interest in attacker Antoine Semenyo before tightening the purse strings.",
      "The decision was made to sign three attacking players last summer, in Bryan Mbeumo, Matheus Cunha and Benjamin Sesko, as well as goalkeeper Senne Lammens, and United insist Amorim was on board with that recruitment plan and happy with the decision to strengthen the attack over the midfield.",
      "In his press conference after the Leeds draw, Amorim had demanded to be the manager at United rather than the coach, even though his job title since his appointment in November 2024 was head coach. United have no plans to change that structure and their next appointment is likely to have to accept the same job title.",
      "United sources point out that the £250million spent since Amorim's arrival made the club one of the highest spenders in the Premier League in that time. Although the team have shown signs of improvement this season and sit sixth in the Premier League, the decision has been made to axe Amorim to give the squad a better chance of qualifying for the Champions League next season.",

      "The structure of Manchester United's hierarchy has been reiterated following Ruben Amorim's sacking. United announced Amorim had been sacked on Monday, a day after he appeared to suggest Jason Wilcox and Christopher Vivell should focus on their own jobs at the club.",
      "Last weekend, a report from the Daily Mail claimed director of football Wilcox, and director of recruitment Vivell, had concerns over Amorim's system and his unwavering stance on tactics. Speaking after the Leeds draw, Amorim said: \"In every department - the scouting department, the sporting director needs to do their job. I will do mine for 18 months, and then we move on.”",
      "United confirmed Amorim had departed within 24 hours of those comments. Club sources insist there have been no power struggles, but Amorim's comments contradict that claim.",
      "Amorim was widely considered to be calling out key decision-makers at Old Trafford. The 40-year-old has now been axed, and club sources have reiterated that the board come above the remit of a head coach.",
      "United insist they have developed an 'expert leadership team' that allows the club to operate at the highest levels. Sources have said that although a head coach is seen as key, they do not sit above, due to a collaborative approach and structure being seen as imperative to achieve success.",
      "Omar Berrada was appointed as CEO following Sir Jim Ratcliffe's acquisition of a minority stake at United in 2024, and the appointments of Wilcox (director of football) and Vivell (director of recruitment) followed.",
      "Ratcliffe has spoken about his desire to employ the \"best-in-class\", but United suffered their worst season for 51 years in 2024/2025 and have made a mixed start to the current campaign. Berrada oversaw the appointment of Amorim and Wilcox has overseen recruitment.",

      "Rio Ferdinand has claimed he would \"put all my money on\" Oliver Glasner not being appointed as Ruben Amorim's replacement at Manchester United.",
      "Crystal Palace manager Glasner, 51, has emerged as a contender to succeed Amorim at Old Trafford after the club decided to sack the Portuguese head coach on Monday morning.",
      "Glasner has done a stellar job since joining Palace in February 2024, guiding them to FA Cup glory at the end of last season and then the Community Shield at the start of this campaign. During his time in south London, the ex-Wolfsburg and Eintracht Frankfurt boss has won 41 and drawn 28 of his 93 matches in charge.",
      "With United deciding to axe Amorim, Glasner has been linked with becoming the next United head coach. However, Ferdinand doesn't see the Reds appointing Glasner, due to the fact he uses a three-at-the-back formation.",
      "\"No way,\" ex-United defender Ferdinand said on Rio Ferdinand Presents when asked about the possibility of Glasner taking over. \"There's no way, I don't think. I would be so surprised if Glasner gets an opportunity to be Man United manager given that he plays three-at-the-back.",
      "\"Based on how this team has performed and the narrative that has been surrounding the team since Amorim has been here: I would put all my money on it that he doesn't get that job.\"",
      "Amorim had faced pressure for sticking with his three-at-the-back system despite performances and results not improving at the race some were hoping for. Indeed, after using his tried-and-trusted 3-4-2-1 formation for most of last Tuesday's 1-1 draw against rock bottom Wolves, Amorim was scrutinised even more.",
      "Glasner, meanwhile, has enjoyed success with his 3-4-3 shape at Palace. Marc Guehi, Maxence Lacroix and Chris Richards are the three that have typically provided a solid foundation at the back, with Daniel Munoz and Tyrick Mitchell giving width as the two wing-backs. Adam Wharton and one of Will Hughes or Jefferson Lerma have been used as the midfield two, followed by a dynamic front three including Jean-Philippe Mateta.",
      "It's a system that has worked for Glasner, with Palace riding the crest of a wave in their first-ever European campaign and sitting comfortable in mid-table in the Premier League. Although the Eagles have lost four of their last five top-flight matches, they still sit just four points behind fifth-place Chelsea in the table.",
      "As for United, Darren Fletcher is set to take charge on an interim basis for Wednesday's trip to Burnley. They will be looking to return to winning ways after back-to-back draws against Wolves and Leeds United.",

      "Dan Ashworth would have known the end was coming at Manchester United when he was marched through the press conference room soon after the defeat to Nottingham Forest in December 2024. This was a public sacking for a figure who had gone from hero to zero in five months in the eyes of Sir Jim Ratcliffe.",
      "Ashworth was the man Ratcliffe called \"one of the best sporting directors in the world\" during protracted negotiations with Newcastle to lure him to Old Trafford. However, within months, relations had soured. It reflected poorly on Ratcliffe at the time and now, with the dismissal of Ruben Amorim, the manager over whom Ashworth had so many reservations, even worse.",
      "Ratcliffe could have picked up the phone to anyone in the game and been told Ashworth was a structures guy, not the kind of sporting director who would hand over a list of the five most highly rated 30-something coaches in Europe. He was a sensible appointment for a club that needed reshaping. But his caution over the appointment of Amorim ultimately did for him.",
      "Ashworth could see the problems coming of parachuting in a head coach mid-season who had a distinctive playing style. This wasn't a squad built for Amorim's 3-4-2-1 and neither did United have the cash to transform it.",
      "It was a sensible, pragmatic, common-sense approach, but didn't fit with the bravado and excitement of everyone else involved. Amorim was the shiny new toy, the up-and-coming coach who had built an excellent reputation at Sporting and when he guided his old club to a 4-1 win against Manchester City in November 2024, Old Trafford had fallen head over heels.",
      "In hindsight, now that the Portuguese has been unceremoniously sent packing after just 14 months at the helm, the concerns Ashworth highlighted were correct. Amorim might still be an excellent coach (or manager), and with the right players, his system might be a success somewhere. But these weren't conditions he was ever likely to encounter at United and it's been proven.",
      "Instead, he played his system without the tools to do and his team became too predictable as a result. Most of the best managers in the game have a fairly distinctive style of play, but it is often unstoppable because they have the players to execute it. Not at Old Trafford. Not for Amorim.",
      "When his bosses were telling him to change the system and that there was no money, it was hard to see how he would ever survive and create a successful team. That chance is now gone.",
      "Director of football Jason Wilcox and chief executive Omar Berrada are damaged by the episode, their reputations at the club linked to Amorim's appointment. This was their big call and it has gone horribly wrong.",
      "It will take some explaining away when there was at least one senior figure in the building sounding the alarm bells. They ignored that warning and pressed ahead anyway. The surprise is the nature of the unravelling. less than 14 months on, not that it happened.",
      "So now, does Ratcliffe trust Wilcox and Berrada to get the next appointment right? Ratcliffe himself has hitched himself to the success of a head coach he likes.",
      "The 73-year-old was desperate for his first appointment to be the right one, but that has not happened. Now, the past 14 months feel like a waste. United are no further on than when Erik ten Hag was sacked - and the Dutchman won trophies, in fairness to him.",
      "Ashworth might have advocated an appointment considered safer, maybe even a little more boring. He would have been panned for pushing Gareth Southgate's credentials and Thomas Frank has struggled with the step up from Brentford to Tottenham. But in pointing out the pitfalls of going for Amorim, he could see what was likely to happen.",

      "Crystal Palace manager Oliver Glasner is among those being touted for a move to Manchester United following the dismissal of Ruben Amorim by Old Trafford bosses. Earlier this season, the Austrian's remarks suggested that United had made progress under the Portuguese coach's leadership, but his departure tells a different story.",
      "United had a dismal 2025, ending the season in 15th place with a mere 42 points in the Premier League and only nine victories - their worst performance in the competition's history. This season they've amassed 31 points from 20 matches and sit in sixth place.",
      "While there has been an improvement in terms of points gained, the team's performances have been lacklustre as they struggled to adapt to Amorim's 3-4-3 formation. A draw against relegation-threatened Wolves and a point at Elland Road last weekend led to a fiery post-match press conference from Amorim, where he criticised the club's management and former player Gary Neville.",
      "United issued a statement confirming Amorim's sacking, emphasising their ambition to finish the season as high up the table as possible.",
      "Glasner, who recently led the Eagles to FA Cup and Community Shield victories, is one of the names linked with the now vacant managerial role at United, and his tactical approach aligns closely with that of the now-departed Amorim.",
      "Speaking earlier this season about United's approach under the Portuguese manager, Glasner defended Amorim by highlighting the team's statistical performance.",
      "\"It's really funny talking about the 3-4-3 system, and I think United have the highest xG in the Premier League for scoring goals,\" Glasner said back in November.",
      "\"Their team has changed. Especially in attack. They needed more goals and invested £200m - buying three players up front.",
      "\"Also, now they have players who can play very intense like [Bryan] Mbeumo. For me, that's impressive to see. We compared it [their last meeting] to where they are now.",
      "\"I think their work-rate is much higher than it was last year and then they get the reward.\"",
      "Glasner could represent an immediate solution to replace Amorim, whilst his own situation at Selhurst Park remains uncertain with his contract due to run out this summer. The Austrian is yet to sign fresh terms with the Eagles and might prove to be the solution to United's difficulties.",
      "\"We're playing the same system,\" Glasner said earlier this season when explaining the benefits of lining up in a 3-4-3.",
      "\"So it looks like it's a good attacking system. Also, as we show it, you can have a good defensive structure with it.",
      "\"It's all about what you do with the system and how fluid you are in attack and how creative you are.\"",

      "After sacking Ruben Amorim, Sir Jim Ratcliffe has a big decision to make.",
      "Manchester United have shown flashes of promise this season, but a run of disappointing results - coupled with a breakdown in relations between manager and ownership - led to the axe falling on the Portuguese coach after just 14 months in charge.",
      "Attention now turns to Amorim's successor. While the Red Devils will have no shortage of candidates, one manager Ratcliffe has previously admitted admiring may prove far harder to persuade.",
      "That man is Jurgen Klopp, who famously led Liverpool to both Premier League and Champions League glory. Ratcliffe has waxed lyrical about the German in the past, suggesting that Klopp could well be a dream target of his.",
      "\"Klopp has this ability to drive his players to a frenzy,\" he said back in March 2024, shortly after taking over footballing operations at Old Trafford. \"Total commitment on the pitch. And, you know, that's one of the things a good coach can do.\"",
      "Klopp is currently Head of Global Soccer at Red Bull, having joined the company shortly after leaving Liverpool at the end of the 2023/24 season.",
      "He has previously insisted that his time at Liverpool would be his last in management. Combined with the fierce rivalry between the two clubs, a move to Old Trafford appears supremely unlikely.",
      "Instead, the Red Devils will have to turn their attention to other, more realistic targets. Crystal Palace boss Oliver Glasner is thought to be among the favourites for the role, along with former England head coach Gareth Southgate - another man long admired by Ratcliffe.",
      "Bournemouth's Andoni Iraola, Aston Villa's Unai Emery and former United defender Laurent Blanc are also being linked. For now, however, U-18s coach Darren Fletcher will take charge on an interim basis until a permanent successor is named.",
      "In a statement on Monday morning, United confirmed Amorim's departure. \"Ruben Amorim has departed his role as Head Coach of Manchester United,\" the statement read.",
      "\"Ruben was appointed in November 2024 and led the team to a UEFA Europa League Final in Bilbao in May. With Manchester United sitting sixth in the Premier League, the club's leadership has reluctantly made the decision that it is the right time to make a change.",
      "\"This will give the team the best opportunity of the highest possible Premier League finish. The club would like to thank Ruben for his contribution to the club and wishes him well for the future. Darren Fletcher will take charge of the team against Burnley on Wednesday.\"",
      "Amorim's departure comes in the wake of United's 1-1 draw with Leeds at Elland Road on Sunday. Speaking after the game, the 40-year-old hinted at tensions behind the scenes, insisting he considered himself \"manager\" of United, rather than simply \"coach\".",
      "\"It's going to be like this for 18 months or when the board decide to change,\" Amorim said. \"That was my point, I want to finish with that. I'm not going to quit. I will do my job until another guy is coming here to replace me.\"",

      "Manchester United have reportedly been informed that Gareth Southgate would require 'time' and 'patience' from the club if he were to replace Ruben Amorim. The Reds are on the hunt for their seventh permanent manager since Sir Alex Ferguson's retirement in 2013, following the dismissal of Amorim on Monday.",
      "Doubts over Amorim's future as United boss emerged after Sunday's 1-1 draw at Leeds with the Portuguese hinting at a possible departure when his contract expires in 18 months. Despite officially being appointed as head coach by Ineos in November 2024, the former Sporting man insisted on being referred to as the manager at Old Trafford.",
      "Ineos have now decided to terminate the Amorim project, sacking him after a 14-month stint at M16. The club released a statement confirming his dismissal, expressing optimism that this change will enhance their Premier League performance this season, with European football still very much within reach.",
      "As early as October last year - while Amorim was still at the helm - it was reported that former England manager Southgate was contemplating whether to vie for the managerial role at Old Trafford.",
      "However, it's been suggested that Southgate may have reservations about accepting the role and would require a four-year commitment to turn things around; a timeframe the board might not be willing to offer him or any other candidate. According to The Sun, insiders have indicated that the lifelong United supporter would need assurances that the club's hierarchy would commit to any long-term objectives.",
      "The report also suggests Southgate is worried the board may expect immediate results, whereas his approach focuses on achieving success gradually over an extended period. The 55-year-old has been unemployed since resigning as England manager after leading the Three Lions to second place at Euro 2024, where they lost 2-1 to Spain in the final.",
      "However, the ex-Crystal Palace, Aston Villa and Middlesbrough player-turned-manager has been linked with a managerial position at United since Sir Jim Ratcliffe acquired a minority stake in the club in February 2024.",
      "Southgate isn't the only manager being considered to replace Amorim. Oliver Glasner, of Palace, and Brighton's Fabian Hurzeler are rumoured favourites for the move to Old Trafford.",
      "Real Madrid legend Zinedine Zidane and Barcelona icon Xavi Hernandez have also been mentioned as potential candidates.",
      "In a statement released after Amorim's sacking on Monday, United said: \"Ruben Amorim has departed his role as head coach of Manchester United. Ruben was appointed in November 2024 and he led the team to a UEFA Europa League Final in Bilbao in May.",

      "The year ended with a whimper for Manchester United. A 1-1 draw with Wolves on Tuesday night continued a dire recent run at Old Trafford and set alarm bells ringing again about the progress of this team under Ruben Amorim.",
      "Dropping points against a side with 16 defeats and two draws from their first 18 games wasn't a good look. Amorim refused to use the absence of key players to injuries and international call-ups as an excuse, and any team United put out should be capable of beating this Wolves team.",
      "However, it is true that Amorim's resources are currently stretched. The damage done was also eased by other results. Chelsea dropped points at home to Bournemouth, just as United did in December, and then sacked head coach Enzo Maresca on New Year's Day.",
      "Elsewhere on the first day of 2026, Liverpool lumbered to a goalless draw with Leeds at Anfield. Arne Slot's side have picked up better results recently, but they still aren't playing well and are having to grind out results every week.",
      "With the top three of Arsenal, Manchester City and Aston Villa edging clear, it might be that two from three of United, Chelsea and Liverpool will qualify for the Champions League, presuming the Premier League can land that fifth spot once again for next season.",
      "There will be honourable mentions for Sunderland and Everton, who have had excellent first halves of the season, while the league is so congested that only five points separate Chelsea in fifth from Brighton in 14th. A good run of form could propel any number of clubs into the mix.",
      "For United, they would probably have taken this at the halfway stage of the campaign. They are sixth, behind Chelsea only on goal difference and three points shy of Liverpool. Qualification for the Champions League is attainable this season.",
      "The concern is that a woeful run at home might look costly come the end of the season. They have taken three points from home games against Everton, West Ham, Bournemouth and Wolves. The first of those played with 10 men for the best part of 80 minutes and the other three were - and still are - in poor form.",
      "United will have to improve to make the top five, but possibly not by much. Liverpool still look like a flawed team, and Chelsea are unpredictable. The departure of Maresca might change things, but a young and inexperienced squad will be tested in the second half of the campaign.",
      "Amorim's side haven't taken advantage of a kinder fixture list recently and now face Manchester City and Arsenal in January, but having put themselves in a position to achieve what was the primary objective this season, they should consider rolling the dice this month.",
      "Interest in Antoine Semenyo waned when it became clear he wanted to move to Manchester City, but United's willingness to do a deal suggests there is money available to improve the squad. The conditions for a January deal are that the focus remains on long-term targets and adding real quality this month can be difficult to do.",
      "Beefing up numbers to compensate for the lack of depth is also an issue that should ease as the month progresses. Kobbie Mainoo, Mason Mount and Bruno Fernandes should all be back fit soon and Noussair Mazraoui, Amad and Bryan Mbeumo will be back from the Africa Cup of Nations by January 19 at the latest.",
      "But United should be and are alert to opportunities in midfield, with question marks over the futures of several key players. There is also uncertainty as to whether Mainoo will push for a loan move if his chances of first-team football don't improve over the next couple of weeks.",
      "Joshua Zirkzee is also eyeing up a move to Roma. His departure could leave Amorim short of attacking opportunities, with Benjamin Sesko the only natural centre-forward in the squad. Finding a permanent replacement might not be easy, but adding a striker to the squad to offer support and cover for Sesko could be beneficial.",
      "These kinds of January deals might only move the needle ever so slightly; they might only be worth a point or two come the final calculations, but in what is shaping up to be a tight race for places in the top five, that might be all it takes to make them value for money.",
      "At the halfway stage, United have put themselves in the conversation. Now they need to do all they can to finish the job.",

      "Toby Collyer is set to be fit before the end of January, but the midfielder could remain at Manchester United for the rest of the season, rather than being loaned out again. The 21-year-old was officially recalled from his loan with Championship side West Brom on New Year's Day, but he has been at Carrington since the end of November after suffering a calf injury with the Baggies.",
      "Collyer struggled for game time before suffering his injury setback, starting just three Championship games and making 12 appearances in total. After sustaining his injury, he has been undergoing rehabilitation with his parent club. He could have returned to the Hawthorns when fit, but United have made the decision to recall him from a planned season-long loan due to concerns over his playing time in the Midlands, as well as his injury issue.",
      "The former Brighton youngster is expected to be fit again by the end of this month, having not featured competitively since sustaining a calf injury during West Brom’s 1-1 draw with Birmingham City in late November.",
      "Collyer will be monitored now that he is back at United and could stay at the club for the remainder of the season if Ruben Amorim decides to keep him as part of the first-team squad.",
      "The midfielder has made 13 appearances for United, 10 of which came under Amorim last season. Although United will have a light schedule in the second half of the season, there is uncertainty over the futures of Manuel Ugarte and Kobbie Mainoo in the January transfer window, with both attracting loan interest.",
      "If Collyer plays for United this month, it would prohibit another loan move, as players can only play for two clubs during a season. If he doesn't feature, then another loan switch to play first-team football remains an option.",

      "Manchester United have a proud history of integrating academy stars into their first-team early, often when rivals would have chosen to be more cautious. The Class of '92 are the poster boys for this movement and have shaped the United philosophy in the years which have followed.",
      "Even as we exit 2025 and enter 2026, United are still seen as a club who give youth a chance. We only have to look back to last January and see how Ayden Heaven chose to leave Arsenal because the opportunities were readily available in the north west, to prove this theory.",
      "However, while it may be inadvertent, Ruben Amorim seems to have forged a war with the academy players which is leading to an awkward succession line. Alejandro Garnacho was a recent academy graduate who failed to see eye-to-eye with the manager and it feels a similar situation is starting to brew with Kobbie Mainoo - albeit it is nowhere near the same level yet.",
      "But even further down the pecking order, there is some worrying signs of a disconnect between the two levels. Earlier this month, Amorim felt the need to call out Harry Amass, currently at Sheffield Wednesday, and Chido Obi for sending subtle messages to him on Instagram.",
      "\"Sometimes strong words is not bad words, sometimes difficult moments is not the bad things for the kids,\" Amorim told a largely stunned press conference. \"We don't need to be always with accolades in everything in every situation, we are not helping.",
      "\"That's why when you guys talk about a lot of players nowadays that they go against the clubs and everything happened because they feel entitlement. I think it's something in our club, and we talk about the players sometimes forget about what it means to play for Manchester United.",
      "\"We as a club sometimes forget who we are and that's that's the feeling that I have. I understand everything is the environment, is the moment of the players, the kids they feel entitled. They feel free to respond to the manager with a picture, my office is open, nobody is coming to talk to me.\"",
      "Since then, Amorim has needed to rely on the youngsters just to fill his squad. Obi made the bench alongside Shea Lacey, Tyler Fletcher, and his twin Jack, Tyler Fredricson and Bendito Mantato. Only Jack Fletcher and Mantato were brought on to face the Premier League's worst club Wolves.",
      "Fletcher and Fredricson's place as unused substitutes made sense considering they are a midfielder and defender respectively. But the decision to overlook Obi and Lacey was surprising.",
      "It left many wondering why the duo were picked on the bench if they were going to be ignored when the team needs a goal, despite being attackers. Perhaps sensing a backlash, Amorim went on the offensive post-match.",
      "\"It's completely different and you know that when there is a lot of new people in different positions and you put one young kid, he will struggle,\" the United manager said assuredly. \"It's completely different when you have a base, everything is working well and you can give minutes to a young kid.",
      "\"You look at the game and you understand clearly and you see our team and you know that you are going to struggle in certain aspects and I think that was what happened during the game.\" The way Amorim suggested things would go from bad to worse if he had thrown in more young players, should grate the academy stars' nerves.",
      "They should be feeling hard done by because, regardless of the lack of options, they were first-team players on Tuesday night and when the game needed attackers, they were overlooked. That should fuel something in them now to prove Amorim wrong.",
      "Like the United boss said in the middle of this month, this does not mean Obi and Lacey should take to Instagram to send subtle but immature messages to the manager. Instead, the objective should be to knuckle down and prove to Amorim he has misjudged their talents and they can actually be brought on to make a difference.",
      "While United have so many players out, Amorim will need to continue using academy players on his bench. Eventually, there will come a time when the Reds' boss bites the bullet and gives them a chance to impress and just like Fletcher has done, they need to take it.",

      "Manchester United have been handed a boost in their proposed chase for RB Leipzig forward Yan Diomande, with the club's chief Oliver Mintzlaff admitting that they could sell him if the price was right.",
      "Diomande has been named as a possible alternative target to Antoine Semenyo for United. The Bournemouth man looks to be heading to rivals Manchester City, despite interest from United, leaving Ruben Amorim's side looking at other potential options moving forward.",
      "While RB Leipzig will be keen to keep hold of their young talent, it's been hinted that a big offer could tempt the German club into cashing-in on his signature.",
      "In an interview with German outlet Welt, Mintzlaff said: \"We want to ensure that we don't just develop players for one year. But that we can also retain top talents for longer.",
      "\"We still see ourselves as a top club in the Bundesliga. And for young players like (Assan) Ouedraogo or Diomande, it would be good to take the next steps with us and consistently perform at a high level.",
      "\"However, it will remain the case in the future that we will occasionally have to let our players go. We still need to generate transfer fees and have players in our squad who are attractive to absolute top clubs.",
      "\"Generally speaking, you should never rule anything out in football. If there's an exorbitant offer far above market value, and we are convinced that it's a unique opportunity for a significant profit, then we have to be honest with ourselves, discuss it, and keep a cool head.\"",
      "The 19-year-old is currently on Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) duty with the Ivory Coast. So far this season, he has scored six times and provided a further three assists in 14 Bundesliga games.",
      "United are not alone in their interest with Bayern Munich and Paris Saint-Germain also claimed to be tracking his development closely.",
      "While the comments are seemingly positive news for United, it doesn't necessarily mean they will launch a move during the January window - or even next summer.",
      "It's reported that United are not certain to pursue an alternative to Semenyo in the upcoming window, but could potentially accelerate their interest if other clubs do.",
      "Instead, that might in turn be one for future windows, with eyes also on midfield targets. The position has been identified as a priority for United with names such as Nottingham Forest's Elliot Anderson, Crystal Palace's Adam Wharton and Brighton's Carlos Baleba all being linked.",

      "Rasmus Hojlund's permanent transfer from Manchester United to Napoli is all but confirmed, according to a top official at the Italian club. The striker was loaned to the Serie A giants for the season and has made an immediate impact.",
      "Napoli have the option to make the move permanent for €50m (£43.6m) at the end of the loan spell, which will become mandatory if they secure a Champions League spot this season. However, all the signs point towards Hojlund making a permanent switch regardless.",
      "Giovanni Manna, Napoli's director, has stated that both the club and Hojlund view the transfer as essentially finalised, reports the Mirror.",
      "“We did everything we could to sign him. There were more storied clubs interested, but his will was crucial, and we are proud of it,” Manna said in an interview with Italian outlet Corriere dello Sport.",
      "“We had no doubts. Rasmus is decisive in terms of numbers, but also in how he understands the coach’s input. This makes a difference.",
      "“There’s an option to buy and an obligation to buy if we qualify for the Champions League. The player considers himself a Napoli player, and the same goes for us. This is extremely important.”",
      "When quizzed about whether a permanent move for Hojlund was likely, Manna responded: “As of today, I think so.”",
      "These remarks from Manna follow reports in Italy suggesting that Napoli are already preparing the terms of Hojlund's contract as a full-time player. Reports suggest the striker will have a €85m (£74.2m) release clause included in his contract in Naples - with that clause becoming active in the summer of 2027. Hojlund has netted seven goals in 19 appearances for the Serie A outfit this campaign.",
      "“Hojlund is a player who is very young, he’s still only 22 years old, and can improve a great deal,” Napoli boss Antonio Conte said about Hojlund’s form recently.",
      "“Since he first joined us, he has already progressed to become a dominant player in that role, because he’s starting to understand the right positions to take, how to defend the ball, when to come towards it or back off.\"",
      "The Italian added: “He is really well connected with the team. In my style of football, the strikers have a very important and special role in the overall approach, and he has huge margin for further improvement.”",
      "Hojlund signed for United from Atalanta in 2023, bagging 16 goals during his first campaign at Old Trafford before adding another ten in his second season, with only four of those coming in the Premier League.",

      "Ruben Amorim went back to his favoured back three system for Manchester United's Premier League clash with Wolves to try and counter the approach from the Premier League's basement boys. Amorim finally moved to a back four against Newcastle on Boxing Day and saw his side win 1-0, with a much more fluent attacking performance in the first half. But with winless Wolves at Old Trafford, he opted for a safety-first approach and sought to match Wolves' system.",
      "United were missing eight players through injuries or international call-ups, but produced a flat performance against a team that had taken just two points from their first 18 Premier League games of the season. Joshua Zirkzee's deflected shot gave them the lead, but Ladislav Krejci equalised before half-time and the visitors came closest to winning the game.",
      "Amorim admitted his change in system was based on his evaluation of Wolves and that he moved Patrick Dorgu back to wing-back to try and take advantage of that.",
      "\"We knew that they will play with a five, use the width, today was to do that and sometimes build up with him [Dorgu] open or close with Luke doing the opposite, we try to arrange the right situations,\" said Amorim.",
      "It didn't work and although United were missing key players in Harry Maguire, Matthijs de Ligt, Noussair Mazraoui, Amad, Kobbie Mainoo, Bruno Fernandes, Mason Mount and Bryan Mbeumo, Amorim refused to use those absences as an excuse, but admitted he knew why his side had struggled.",
      "\"That is normal but we didn't use that excuse against Newcastle, we are not going to use it today,\" he said. \"But of course if you see the game I understand why we play the way we play today.",
      "\"The lack of fluidity, lack of one against one. We knew that would be a completely different game compared to Newcastle because in Newcastle we have more space to play. We didn't have to work the plays so much and today we have.\"",

      "\"We need to do what the game was asking,\" was the beginning of Manchester United head coach Ruben Amorim's staunch defence of his decision to take Joshua Zirkzee off at half time during the draw with Wolverhampton Wanderers. For a man who was once cheered off the pitch by United supporters, it is now fitting for Zirkzee that his exit on Tuesday baffled everyone.",
      "But Zirkzee was not injured and Amorim was keen to defend his decision to bring on Jack Fletcher and solidify the midfield further. \"They put a lot of men in the middle of the park and with Jack we balanced that,\" Amorim continued.",
      "\"I think we recovered the ball faster in the second half. In the first half we struggled a little bit to recover the ball so I'm just looking not for their age and experience and in this moment I just look at what I can do to win the game.\"",
      "Sadly for Amorim, his excuse for hauling Zirkzee off was flimsy at best. While the Dutchman may have been fortunate to score the opener, he was at least providing a threat for United. At that stage of the match, with United still needing a goal, taking off a forward for a midfielder was not the option. The optics were terrible and while Fletcher did well when he was introduced into the game, Benjamin Sesko, Patrick Dorgu and Matheus Cunha did not muster up nearly enough going forward to win the match for the Reds.",
      "Ultimately, substituting Zirkzee at half time is a clear sign of what the future holds for United heading into the January transfer window. Amorim seems destined to allow the Dutchman to depart next month and there seems very little the 24-year-old can do to change his mind.",
      "Since the Reds invested in the attack during the summer transfer window, Zirkzee has been on borrowed time. Rasmus Hojlund was perhaps wise to jump at the opportunity to leave for Napoli upon the arrival of Sesko.",
      "Like Hojlund, Zirkzee is not a player who Amorim sees fitting the system. The glimmer of hope for the forward's United career was him being able to gain more chances while there was absentees.",
      "What Tuesday night proved is that this route is not available to Zirkzee either. It is understood AS Roma have a keen interest in bringing Zirkzee back to Serie A and a return to Italy is the best option for him, especially if he wants to make a late bid for the Netherlands national team in a World Cup year.",
      "As for Amorim and United, the pressure is on. If Zirkzee is to leave in January, they must look to replace him with a recognised striker. The United boss has spoken at length about his desire to sign players who can benefit the club in the future, not just the present. But how many of those centre-forwards are available and fit the bill in January?",
      "All the pressure is on the powers that be at Old Trafford now because if the substitution against Wolves is a sign of Zirkzee's impending exit, they will be expected to adequately replace him. Waiting for the summer is simply not an option for the Reds when the attack is wafer thin already.",

      "Senne Lammens wore a polo shirt and a navy sweatshirt when he visited Old Trafford after signing for Manchester United. The young goalkeeper looked as though he could be joining United to work in their HR department.",
      "The same observation was made when Lammens reported for international duty with Belgium last week - the 23-year-old was dressed in a beige collared jacket, a khaki t-shirt and chinos.",
      "\"By accident, I saw an article saying he was wearing something boring when he reported for international duty and fans saying they hoped he stays like this,\" laughed Hayk Milkon, one of Lammens' former coaches.",
      "\"This 'boringness' is just the way Senne is, he's really calm and no excesses. He focuses on what he needs to focus on and is open with the people around him. He keeps his feet on the ground.\"",
      "If Lammens looks like someone who could work in an office, every workplace would love to have him in their five-a-side team. United believe they have signed a young goalkeeper with huge potential, and fans who were present at Old Trafford against Sunderland left the stadium buzzing about his debut.",
      "The quirk is that Lammens appears to be a different person when he wears his goalkeeper kit. He made a supremely confident United debut, aggressively commanded his area and kept a clean sheet.",
      "Milkon coached Lammens during their time together at Club Brugge. Milkon is now the youngest manager in the Belgian top-flight and Lammens plays for the biggest club in England.",
      "\"It was Senne with his headphones on. He would go into the gym to do his recovery or some extra top-ups. Or he would just go to relax by playing basketball - he loved to play basketball.\"",
      "Milkon coached in different roles at Club Brugge. He was the assistant of Club NXT (their reserve team), served as their interim manager, was in charge of the Under-18s and eventually became a first-team coach.",
      "His time at Club Brugge coincided with Lammens progressing from the academy to their first team, so he is uniquely positioned to provide insight into United's new goalkeeper signing.",
      "Lammens joined Club Brugge's academy when he was 12. \"He was a guy with huge potential,\" said Milkon. \"As I learned from colleagues who had worked with him when he was much younger, I heard there was a moment that clicked in his head when he became super professional.",
      "\"He was one of the guys during Covid - when the players were not able to train - who was doing a lot at home, he was really going far with this to be the best in these types of areas.",
      "\"Then he continued like this when he joined the first team to train with them. He always wanted to improve. We also had something in place to look at the parameters on which goalkeepers are judged.",
      "\"You see the potential of the goalkeeper based on what they do in games; so their positioning, their decision-making and so on, and Senne was always quite high in these areas.",
      "\"The only bad luck that he had was that the first-team goalkeeper was Simon Mignolet. He's an amazing goalkeeper, so it was difficult for Senne to stay over there in the role of No.2.",
      "\"That would have also blocked his growth, so it was good for him in the end to make the step to go to Antwerp and he did a tremendous job there. It was amazing to see how fast he adapted.\"",
      "Milkon continued: \"I think for us at Club Brugge, it was very clear to everyone that Senne was a top goalkeeper. He would have been the perfect fit for Club Brugge to be the No.1.",
      "\"That was not possible because Mignolet was there. But the parameters that we used to judge his performances indicated he was ticking so many boxes already, and he was consistently doing it.",
      "\"There weren't ups and downs with his performances. He was consistently really high and when you compare this to the top goalkeepers, you have a benchmark to say 'Ok, what potential does this guy have?'",
      "\"He had some chances with the first team at Club Brugge and made a mistake, or maybe two, but in the end it was very clear to everyone that he was a top goalkeeper.",
      "\"It was impossible to try to extend his contract because, again, you have Mignolet, and you cannot block a guy like this. You know he has to go out, he has to play, and he will improve even more.\"",
      "When asked about Lammens' strengths, he said: \"I would say that his decision-making was very good. He is very calm, he sees the solutions on the pitch, he has a quick reaction time and understands the balance between risk and reward, and which decisions are the right ones to make.",
      "\"His clean passing is great, his footwork was really good, and he's just an amazing goalkeeper with the shot-stopping. He made some incredible saves back then already. He's quite a complete goalkeeper.",
      "\"But making the right decisions at a very young age, being very mature with this, was really impressive. And the fact that he is good with both feet is another big strength.",
      "\"For me, Senne is a very calm guy and has all the qualities to be a top professional. That was my impression when I first met him when he was younger and he never changed.\"",
      "Lammens joined Royal Antwerp on a free transfer in the summer of 2023. He was handed his debut a few months later and served as an understudy that season, but earned first-choice status for 2024/2025.",
      "His performances drew attention from the Belgian media. Lammens saved four penalties across a successful first full campaign and received a call-up to Belgium's senior squad in March.",
      "Milkon said: \"I was not surprised when I saw Manchester United had come calling. And to record his first clean sheet, I was really happy for him. Senne is a potential No.1 for the Red Devils - the Belgium national team.",
      "\"He got his chance, he took it, and we're all really proud of him, but we knew it would happen. I believe he has all the capabilities to become the best in the world, so I wish him all the best. I'm sure he will have a very good career in England, and Manchester United should return to the big club they used to be.",
      "\"He will have a positive impact on that, for sure, and hopefully he will be Belgium's first-choice goalkeeper soon. I believe he has the potential, the skillset and the personality to do that.",
      "\"For me, it was just having a tiny little part in having an influence on him at Brugge, but it was the most positive memories of our relationship that we had during this spell.",
      "\"I'm very proud that he is reaching these high levels and not surprised. I believe he will be successful because he is a guy who will not change his focus or start to do something different. He is calm, that's his personality and character, and he wants to succeed. He is hungry and will keep working to be his best.",
      "\"He is so calm, and you have to be patient in football. You cannot worry too much and want things too early, but finding the balance between not being impatient and, at the same time, pushing and demanding what you deserve in a good way, means everything will sort itself out.\"",
      "United staff who have worked with Lammens at Carrington have echoed Milkon's sentiments. He has been described as \"really mature for his age\" and is said to have taken the move in his stride.",
      "Lammens is understood to have impressed coaches during training sessions and a United source said that lots of people have been speaking positively about him. He has already relocated from the luxury hotel where he was initially staying and into a house.",
      "It's no surprise that Lammens likes to play basketball at 6ft 3in, but he is a keen golfer, which is common ground with the likes of Tom Heaton, Luke Shaw, Mason Mount and Harry Maguire.",
      "Matthijs de Ligt, Amad, Maguire and Shaw jogged straight to Lammens to congratulate him after full-time against Sunderland. \"Are you Schmeichel in disguise?\" was chanted at Lammens from the Stretford End.",
      "It remains to be seen whether Lammens will start against Liverpool on Sunday, but it would be a surprise to see him on the bench after delivering a strong debut before the international break.",
      "There would be nothing boring about keeping another clean sheet - this time at Anfield.",
      "Kitbag has slashed the price of Man United kits and merch with up to 50% off select items.",

      "READ: Ruben Amorim is the worst of 19 Sir Jim Ratcliffe mistakes at Manchester United",
      "He added: ‘Wilcox had intended the meeting to be a positive look at the evolution of the team but when the system was raised – Amorim’s go-to 3-4-3 formation – the Portuguese coach “blew up”, according to sources.’",
      "Before Wallace continued: ‘The feeling at the club was that as soon as Amorim found himself under pressure he went back to his favoured system – whether it was suitable or not for the opposition. His angry reaction to Wilcox’s observations indicated to the club hierarchy that he had taken United as far as he could. ‘",

      "“It’s been more of the same. Reactive. Slow to spot trends. Making appointments without really appearing to know what they’re doing.",
      "“To suddenly be questioning internally the Amorim strategy rather than just results… They seemed to accept his formation, his adherence to a three-man central defence for most of the past 14 months.",

      "Regular readers of these hallowed pages will know that our push for Premier League managerial sackings is generally limited to five, maybe six, reasons why they should be shown the door.",
      "But This Is Manchester United Football Club We’re Talking About. So we’ve come up with 20 reasons why they have finally parted ways with Ruben Amorim…",
      "",
      "We would be completely bored of it ages ago if we didn’t actually quite look forward to witnessing the level of exasperation shown by Amorim when asked by a reporter in each and every press conference or post-defeat interview whether he might consider changing his formation.",
      "He maintained, almost entirely on the basis of success at one other football club, that it was not the system that was the problem. This is despite the clear recent evidence suggesting otherwise.",
      "Performances did slightly improve as Amorim made tweaks to cope with injuries, but Man Utd went backwards again before his demise as he reverted to his ineffective formation.",
      "The ‘it worked at Sporting’ argument very simply falls down on the basis of Manchester United not being Sporting, and we do wonder whether Amorim now regrets his early insistence that he would stick with 3-4-3 no matter what.",
      "While he understandably saw a move away from his principles as a respect-dwindling admission of defeat, surely the very real, actual defeats were far more damaging to his reputation.",
      "READ: Who will be the next Man Utd manager after Ruben Amorim sacking?",
      "",
      "We’re as culpable as anyone for lumping formation and philosophy together. They go hand in hand – we get it. But it’s also possible for a system to not be working for a team while the wider ethos is apparent. That was not the case here.",
      "Without saying ‘pressing’ or ‘transition’ because literally every f***er with a few magnets on a tactics board would pick those two facets of the game as key to their philosophy, can anyone tell us what Amorim’s core Manchester United principles were? You said ‘overloads’, didn’t you? Get out.",
      "",
      "Of the ever-present Premier League teams since Amorim’s appointment, only Spurs, West Ham United and Wolves have a lesser total…",
      "",
      "Like a p*ssed up bloke down the pub going nose to nose with you looking for any excuse for a rumble, he’s f***ing asked for it.",
      "After being talked down from a ledge after a 3-1 defeat to Brighton in January, when he told United bosses he was ‘prepared to resign’, reports continued to suggest Amorim may walk before he’s pushed, but he opted to stick around for his £12m compensation.",
      "",
      "Erik ten Hag kept his job because Manchester United won the FA Cup final. Sure, it was maybe the only time in the entirety of his second season at Old Trafford when performance and result came together, and it was absolute madness to hand him a new contract on the back of it, but it was a trophy, and one they claimed by beating very much the best team in England at the time in Manchester City.",
      "Amorim didn’t win a trophy and lost to the 17th best team in England, managed by a guy whose only three victories in his last 15 games in all competitions for Tottenham and now Nottingham Forest came in that final and the two semi-finals against Bodo/Glimt.",
      "",
      "Mainoo’s teammates were ‘perplexed’ at him being sidelined by Amorim, Gary Lineker was “really worried” about him being “dismissed” and “baffled” by him not starting, and so too was Owen Hargreaves, who quite rightly said he was United’s “best player by a country mile” having come off the bench in September’s defeat to Manchester City at the Etihad.",
      "Amorim felt he was “helping” Mainoo, but it’s hard to see how and the academy graduate must have been similarly confused as to why he’s not played in a team performing so poorly. Just how bad do they have to be for him to be given a fair chance?",
      "He was told by Amorim that it’s either him or Bruno Fernandes, but we refuse to accept that Mainoo – ill-suited or not – would fail to do a better job alongside the Manchester United captain than competition winner Manuel Ugarte, and it’s not as though Fernandes himself has been in undroppable form.",
      "Not only are United terrible, but there’s no place in the team for someone deemed by many to be the future of the club. It was not a good look.",
      "",
      "It was supposedly an obsession with Amorim’s charisma which played no small part in Ratcliffe and INEOS plumping for him as their manager, and he would probably have been out of the job earlier if it wasn’t for that charm. It makes him a very difficult man to dislike and there’s no doubting his ability to hold the room.",
      "But if anything, he’s honest to a fault, and we can’t imagine Ratcliffe and the INEOS bosses were too enamoured with him besmirching the great name of Manchester United.",
      "Heralding this as “the worst team in Manchester United history” can’t be good for the share price.",
      "",
      "“How are you supposed to adapt to a situation when you’re changing it constantly?!” a genuinely irritated Micah Richards asked on Match of the Day, accompanied by a graphic showing the scattergun changes Amorim made in an attempt to rescue a point against Brentford, which ended with Mason Mount at left wing-back in one of the more laughable examples of his 3-4-3 obstinacy.",
      "We can just about give him a pass for a bit of substitution chaos to turn a game on its head, but what we could not fathom is his insistence on changing at least one of his centre-backs in every single game.",
      "",
      "Some reports suggest sacking Amorim is going to cost the club £12m. For the 2024/25 season, the difference in prize money was around £2.7m per position, meaning any new manager would need to make a five-place improvement on whatever Amorim might achieve this season for his sacking to make fiscal sense. Yer da could do that.",
      "It really is amazing just what a tonic not being at Manchester United is. After finding the net on debut for Napoli, Hojlund now has 12 goal involvements in 21 games.",
      "He has showcased that he is a Proper Striker this season, with the Napoli loanee producing finishes that many Manchester United fans will have been expecting from him when Amorim arrived at the club. He’s got a not dissimilar profile to Viktor Gyokeres, who banged goals in for fun under Amorim in Portugal.",
      "Instead what they got was a clearly talented striker brought to Manchester United ruined by a manager who – as Benjamin Sesko is now also evidence for – doesn’t know how to get the ball to them.",
      "",
      "In Keith Andrews’ eighth game as a football manager he “out-schooled” Amorim. His tactics weren’t revolutionary – they didn’t need to be.",
      "Brentford recycled passes between their defenders while every now and again playing the ball into midfield to draw United on to them. When the United midfielders stepped out to press, Jordan Henderson or someone else played a long ball up to Igor Thiago, who then had what turned out to be the very simple task of bullying one, two or all three centre-backs to win free-kicks, create chances and score goals with the Red Devils midfield nowhere to be seen.",
      "As Alan Shearer said, Amorim made life “easy” for Andrews and every other manager he came up against as they knew exactly how United were going to play.",
      "",
      "Glasner is currently the bookies favourite to replace Amorim and would apparently take the job “in a heartbeat”. More fool him.",
      "The Austrian makes a lot of sense, not least because of the wonderful progress he’s made at Palace, first without Michael Olise and now without Eberechi Eze, but also because he’s showing that 3-4-3 can work in the Premier League and his contract expires at the end of the season.",
      "Gareth Southgate is also in the running favourite and we can see why he’s Sir Jim Ratcliffe’s pick, but as Jamie Carragher said, “the problem for Ruben Amorim is that every other Premier League manager would look at it and say, ‘I could do a better job than that.'”",
      "",
      "Haven’t heard this nonsense in a while, have we? And we wonder whether that’s because the football Amorim had United playing was so far removed from the fabled Manchester United DNA that the genetics of the football club are no longer even considered as part of the ‘what’s wrong with United’ rhetoric.",
      "Ole back at the wheel, anyone?",
      "",
      "“Something has to change and you cannot change 22 players,” Amorim said after the historic defeat to League Two Grimsby, in another hint at a possible resignation, having claimed “the players spoke really loud” through their performance.",
      "But the players might argue, as we and a raft of other publications and pundits did, that Amorim rocking from side to side on the bench as his team lost the penalty shootout was a pretty deafening declaration of a more overarching defeat.",
      "",
      "There’s always a rock under the one at the bottom. And while there’s undoubtedly some recency bias involved, with the latest defeat often declared a new nadir to sell a sack story or just because it’s fun to write and read about last week’s “worst Manchester United team in history” being somehow better than this week’s, there may also be a cumulative effect which automatically makes the most recent defeat the new nadir because of the sustained period of sh*te.",
      "Anyway, there were plenty. Grimsby, Brentford, a 2-0 home defeat to Graham Potter’s West Ham, Brentford again, Wolves on Boxing Day…",
      "",
      "Amorim was an absolute gift when it comes to presenting us with images of his and Manchester United’s slow death. Aside from smiling pictures in press conferences or while walking into the stadium before the latest crushing blow, there are three stock Amorim photos available for selection: shouty, gesticulating Amorim; crouched down, head-in-hands Amorim; looking down, deep-in-thought Amorim.",
      "We love, love, love that he was asked about that last one after the Brentford defeat, dismissing it as “nothing” and “something I’ve always done”, but we will always choose to side with the body language experts drafted in to give their hot takes.",
      "“You can see him crouched down in a fetal position, almost like what a baby does,” said the Mirror’s crack BLE. “Imagine if someone was about to get beaten up, that’s the first stance they adopt. They go on the ground and put themselves in a fetal position.”",
      "",
      "You’ve got to wonder if, while watching Rashford score a brilliant brace for Barcelona against Newcastle in the Champions League, Ratcliffe and the INEOS bosses considered the possibility that they may have backed the wrong horse.",
      "Rashford would very likely still be a Manchester United player if it was not for Amorim, and is currently performing at a higher level than any of the forwards currently in the Red Devils squad, as he did at Aston Villa last season.",
      "After all of that contrived nonsense in the media about Barcelona sending him back to Old Trafford after a couple of games, he’s now asserted himself as a starter in one of the best teams in Europe, contributing a stunning total of eleven goals and seven assists.",
      "",
      "“I think he’s still in a job, because I think the powers that be on Manchester United have made that many mistakes so far and decisions that they’ve made on and off the pitch that they almost don’t want to admit right now, that they’ve made another,” Jamie Carragher said on Monday Night Football.",
      "Sounds about right, but we put it to Ratcliffe and the Manchester United powers that be that by not admitting to the mistake of hiring Amorim, they made another in not sacking him for so long.",
      "There have been a helluva lot of mistakes though… Ruben Amorim is the worst of 19 Sir Jim Ratcliffe mistakes at Manchester United",
      "",
      "It was reported in September that Amorim was ‘losing the confidence of the dressing room’ as players ‘questioned his refusal to pivot mid-match, with his tactics struggling against the Premier League’s relentless pace’, and we’re not convinced that an Enzo Maresca and Robert Sanchez-inspired victory over Chelsea would have outweighed a Brentford defeat (and subsequent lows) in the dressing room confidence stakes since.",
      "",
      "For Amorim, Ratcliffe, the players, the fans, the cabal of Manchester United pundits, it is really just quite embarrassing just how bad at football they have been over the past 14 months. And yes, it is also quite embarrassing to spend £200m on new players for a manager only to sack him a couple of months later, but what’s the alternative? Wade through this sh*te until January or the summer and spend another wedge of cash on the next raft of ill-advised souls doomed to fail at Old Trafford?",
      "We understand that Amorim was not solely to blame – there are at least five other culprits – but there really was no one more to blame for this mess. He has been a “disaster”.",
      "Crystal Palace boss Oliver Glasner has reportedly been identified as the top target to replace Ruben Amorim at Man Utd with four names on their list.",
      "Man Utd made the decision to sack Ruben Amorim before their 1-1 draw against Leeds on Sunday afternoon, according to reports.",
      "Former Chelsea head coach Enzo Maresca could be set for an immediate return to Premier League management at Man Utd, according to reports.",
      "Chelsea parting ways with Enzo Maresca leaves Nuno Espirito Santo in a familiar position as the Sack Race favourite…",
      "Ruben Amorim managed Manchester United for 14 months and spent a ludicrous amount of money to leave them exactly where he found them.",
      "Man Utd head coach Ruben Amorim made the Red Devils “worse” during his time at Old Trafford, according to former Tottenham midfielder Jamie O’Hara."

      "After buying his stake in Manchester United almost two years ago, Sir Jim Ratcliffe admitted he and his INEOS team had “made a lot of cock-ups” in his other footballing ventures, Lausanne and Nice, presumably in a bid to convince the Red Devils fans that they had learned lessons from those mistakes that would not be repeated at Old Trafford.",
      "“Huge change” off the pitch certainly hasn’t been for the better on it. Ruben Amorim is the latest – and worst – post-Ferguson Manchester United manager to be sacked, seemingly for slightly challenging Jason Wilcox and the board rather than sustained underperformance on the training ground and pitch.",
      "In their official statement on Amorim’s departure, it was said only that ‘the club’s leadership has reluctantly made the decision that it is the right time to make a change. This will give the team the best opportunity of the highest possible Premier League finish.’",
      "There are no quotes from Ratcliffe, Wilcox or Omar Berrada. Those might come soon. But also going by their track record of only really speaking when results are on the up, perhaps not.",
      "In any event, those who made the call to appoint Amorim and have ultimately swung the axe on him ought to be held accountable for that and myriad other questionable strategic calls and ill-advised comments in interviews that are among the mistakes we’ve listed here, including some that the Ratcliffe advocates will claim weren’t his decisions, but – despite his clear ethos of passing it wherever possible – the buck stops with him.",
      "Anyway, strap yourselves in: Ratcliffe’s mistakes ranked from minor to major.",
      "",
      "It doesn’t seem all that unreasonable for a struggling organisation not to hand out £100 Christmas bonuses and instead give members of staff a £40 M&S voucher, and the employees themselves may well have been fine had it been explained to them properly and hadn’t been part of a widespread cost-cutting scheme that’s seen many of their friends and colleagues made redundant while what we assume is now half-ply loo paper is on hand the toilets.",
      "“At least the Glazers prioritised families,” said one staffer. “And anuses,” said another, probably.",
      "",
      "We suspect the Manchester United fans were delighted to hear about Ratcliffe and Ineos’ plan to conduct a ‘thorough strategic review’ of the football club when the British billionaire took charge of all football operations. After years of Glazer family negligence, on and off the pitch, it was necessary.",
      "But while we imagined people in hard hats pointing to leaks in the Old Trafford roof and football coaching svengali Jason Wilcox shaking his head on the side-lines of an Erik ten Hag training session, we didn’t foresee Big Sir Jim himself picking up dirty socks from the academy dressing room.",
      "It’s a level of scrutiny that in some ways reflects well on the fourth-richest man in Britain – he has a hands-on approach – but upon describing the cleanliness of the youth team changing rooms as a ‘disgrace’, along with many of the other facilities on his tour of the club in a leaked whole staff email, Ratcliffe immediately managed to ‘create a toxic feeling inside Carrington’.",
      "He labelled the Manchester United museum – quite possibly the pride and joy of several members of staff – a load of ‘crap’, and in a bid to end the work-from-home culture, told employees to head back to the offices, despite there not being enough desks for them all to work from. ‘If you don’t like it, please seek alternative employment,’ he told them.",
      "Your Simon Jordans claimed it was a necessary shake-up, a method of sorting the wheat from the chaff, but there’s also little doubt that some very capable employees – not necessarily all Gen Z woke snowflakes – won’t have enjoyed Ratcliffe’s authoritarian day-one approach, will have taken it as a bleak sign of what was to come and taken a job in a more forward-thinking environment.",
      "",
      "Ratcliffe’s claim that a “conversation” with the government was required after proposing that Old Trafford is redeveloped into the ‘Wembley of the North’ was galling, to put it mildly.",
      "The suggestion was that the burden of financing United’s next chapter should be shared between him, a man worth around £12bn, and the taxpayers. A brazen proposal even before you consider that Ratcliffe himself is a tax exile having officially changed his residence in 2020 from Hampshire to Monaco in a move estimated to have saved him £4bn, which is enough to build two Wembleys of wherever.",
      "",
      "We all know the guy – it’s always a guy – who suddenly appears one day, is overly friendly in a bid to gain confidences, laughing and joking one second and comically stern the next to keep everyone on their toes. Can be seen staring at walls and slowly stirring tea before snapping out of what we assume is a daydream about making a suit of human skins to ask if you’d like a cup. Yeahhh y’know, that guy.",
      "Ratcliffe’s ‘spy’ is said to be one of the Ineos chiefs taking roles and ‘assuming greater importance’ at the club, deepening what several sources described as a “growing culture of fear”, with staff members tiptoeing around this particular individual for fear of the sack, ‘being extra vigilant about what they say in his presence’.",
      "",
      "In order to give Manchester United the best chance of on-field success, no saving is off-limits in the Ratcliffe regime, as those travelling to the FA Cup final discovered.",
      "As joyous as that day became, any staff attending did so without recourse to former privileges. They each paid £20 towards travel costs that previously came as a perk of the job, while packed lunches were also seen as a luxury they could do without by the penny-pinchers at a club that saved a whopping £6,500 on the day before revealing record revenues of £660m shortly after the Wembley win.",
      "Top lad Bruno Fernandes offered to pay for the staff travel but the Ineos chiefs rejected that proposal because they thought ‘it would reflect badly on the regime’, and apparently didn’t think anyone would have an issue with ‘thousands being shelled out on chauffeured cars’ to take them to the very same event.",
      "",
      "Not nearer the top because they only ‘considered it’ but even thinking about cutting the disabled supporters’ association budget in half is deplorable.",
      "As David Ornsein said, it’s “terrible optics” for a football club that has routinely spunked tens of millions of pounds on average footballers to believe that a viable and reasonable method of cutting costs is to make the lives of their disabled supporters harder. The audacity would almost be impressive if it wasn’t so shameful.",
      "",
      "It would be unreasonable for Ratcliffe to know the name of all, or even most, Manchester United employees. There are a lot of them; far too many in his opinion. But we reckon the captain of the football club should have been in the top ten names learned by Ratcliffe before he rocked up.",
      "We would have thought Katie Zelem wearing a training kit and boots might have been a bit of a giveaway as Ratcliffe doddered towards her like a 99-year-old royal and asked: “And what do you do, little lady?” Disappointed that the competition winner hadn’t curtsied as he approached.",
      "",
      "One good decision Ratcliffe has made was to end the club’s financial commitment to Sir Alex Ferguson. Cutting the jobs of 250 Normal People while continuing to pay £2m to a manager who retired over a decade ago would have been laughable, legend or not.",
      "But the co-owner can consider himself very fortunate that Ferguson still has his ear to the Old Trafford ground having reportedly advised him against an extraordinary move that would have been a PR disaster of epic proportions and speaks to Ratcliffe’s lack of knowledge of what’s important to the football club.",
      "Anyone asked about landmark events in the history of Manchester United would talk extensively about the Busby Babes, who came through the youth ranks and were touted to dominate European football before the Munich air disaster. Their story is woven into the fabric of the football club.",
      "What you don’t want to be doing as the new figurehead of Manchester United is dishonouring those young men or anyone associated with them in any way whatsoever, which makes his supposed plan to ‘revoke the privileges given to the families of the Busby Babes at United’ a truly incredible one.",
      "‘The families of players involved in Sir Matt Busby’s legendary side are regulars in the directors’ box at Old Trafford, but the club’s part-owners had threatened to put an end to those positions’ the report claims, with Ratcliffe’s view presumably that those seats could instead be given to very rich people from faceless companies who may throw a few million his way. Find another way, you berk.",
      "",
      "We don’t think we’ve ever heard of a club increasing ticket prices during a season; as MUST said, the idea that the fans must pay their ‘fair share’ for the club’s excesses and/or mismanagement — and above all, the Glazers lack of investment over two decades — is offensive.",
      "And we would suggest that a parent wanting to take their child to a game and having to shell out £132 for the privilege almost certainly doesn’t give a sh*t about the need to improve ‘operational efficiencies’ and ‘stabilise revenues’. They want to watch good football (alright, baby steps) for less than the cost of their monthly council tax.",
      "In response to the backlash, Ratcliffe said Manchester United are “mediocre” (no arguments here) when “it’s supposed to be one of the best football club’s in the world”. And in every interview he gives he talks about this gap between what they once were and what they are, in a We’re All In This Together sort of way, as if he’s suggesting every United fan should be direct debiting part of their salary to fix problems they have nothing to do with.",
      "The money the fans have already given has been wasted for years, and you want them to pay more to watch arguably the worst collection of footballers in Premier League history? Jog on, mate. An ‘outright rebellion’ is in the post.",
      "",
      "Before Ratcliffe arrived, even under the ownership of those horrible Glazers, Manchester United is said to have felt like a family club despite its global reach. Kath Phipps had a helluva lot to do with that.",
      "She first joined the club as the switchboard operator in September 1968, and was seemingly beloved by anyone who came into contact with her, acting as a bridge that crossed multiple eras.",
      "Sir Alex Ferguson, David Beckham and Jonny Evans were among her famous, frequent visitors in her last months in care, with her friends at the club, including several who had been ousted in the cuts, running a daily rota via WhatsApp to ensure she was never alone until her passing, two days after which her next of kin got a phone call from the club.",
      "A message of condolence presumably, maybe from Ratcliffe himself, letting the bereaved individual know that everyone at the club is thinking of them. That should probably be the minimum when the longest-serving employee of the football club you own dies.",
      "But no, what they received was a call from the football club that had been Kath’s life to enquire about the status of her two season tickets. Scarcely believable evidence of the ‘heart and soul’ of the football club eroding under Ratcliffe.",
      "It being the dearly departed Kath Phipps makes it worse, of course it does, but to think that it would also happening to other Manchester United fans is also really, really horrible.",
      "And if you’re one of the many, many United fans currently shouting It’s Not Sir Jim That’s Making The Phone Calls, you’re absolutely right, but while it’s also probably not Ratcliffe forcing the poor member of staff to take on this abhorrent task, it’s he who has created an environment where money needs to be saved at all costs, including the feelings of the very recently bereaved and the once-highly respected reputation of the football club.",
      "",
      "The optics aren’t great when only a few months after staff members were all told they were crucial in helping contribute to on-field success, 250 of them were made redundant as part of Ratcliffe’s determination to slash costs by scrapping ‘non-essential’ activities.",
      "Nearly a quarter of United’s employees lost their jobs and many of them, understandably, may well have pointed out that poor first-team recruitment has wasted far more money than will have been saved by cutting the rank-and-file workforce.",
      "And those redundancies were made before the club spent £200m in the summer of 2024 on further under-performing footballers, and another £200m this summer on players we can only assume will be similarly underwhelming.",
      "Each of the 250 employees would have to be earning £55,000 per year to make getting rid of them more cost effective than paying Matthijs de Ligt his salary, and that’s without considering the centre-back’s transfer fee, which would have been enough to keep those staff members in their jobs on that wage for three years.",
      "",
      "At the end of June, four months after his purchase of 27% of Manchester United (yes, Manchester United as a whole), Ratcliffe was asked whether he had considered spinning off the women’s team, with Chelsea having recently announced that their side will become a standalone entity.",
      "“We haven’t got into that level of detail with the women’s team yet. We’ve been pretty much focused on how we resolve the first team issues.”",
      "We understand why the men’s team is the priority. It’s the cash cow and what him and his team will ultimately be judged upon. But word to the wise Jim, don’t call them ‘the first team’. The women aren’t reserves just because they’re not men.",
      "A slip of the tongue, maybe, but a telling one which when added to him moving the women out of their training facility and into portable buildings to make room for the men, hardly paints Ratcliffe as a beacon of equality.",
      "Asked in the same interview about what they are doing with the women’s team, Ratcliffe replied: “Well they’ve just won the FA Cup” as if he a) cared having not even watched the game, and b) had anything whatsoever to do with that success.",
      "And imagine if he had given the same answer about the men when – as he well knows – the 2024 FA Cup win deflected from a poor league season and much deeper problems. He did not seem to have the same grasp of the issues with the women’s team, who finished 20 points behind champions Chelsea in the WSL that season.",
      "",
      "Instead of sacking Ten Hag in the summer of 2024 (more on that to come) they got rid of his two assistant coaches, Steve McClaren and Mitchell van der Gaag, replacing them with Rene Hake and Ruud van Nistelrooy, who are arguably the two guys to have been most screwed by Ratcliffe and INEOS’ bungling.",
      "Ruben Amorim brought his own coaches because it would be mad to leave behind the people who have played a significant role in his success at Sporting, meaning Ruud moved to Leicester to destroy his reputation and Rene et al. were out on their ears after three months at Old Trafford.",
      "A lucky escape some would argue and they’ve been well-compensated, as were Sporting for United nicking their manager and coaching staff, which all-in-all left United too close to the PSR line to do anything of significant in January to help Amorim.",
      "",
      "Going for Senne Lammens over Emi Martinez or any other clear No.1 goalkeeper is weird, but it can at least be explained away with a view to not paying exorbitant wages and with an eye on the future. But there is no reasonable explanation for spending well over £200m and failing to fix the biggest problem in the team.",
      "No-one at that football club can believe that Manuel Ugarte is good enough, that Bruno Fernandes can play as one of the two in midfield or that Casemiro still has it in him. They also know, without doubt, that Amorim isn’t going to change his system. So why the p*ssing hell did they not buy Carlos Baleba or an alternative midfield machine?",
      "They are quite clearly f***ed and will continue to get f***ed without one. And we know Ratcliffe probably isn’t involved in transfer strategy, but a huge fan as he purports to be, with the chequebook in hand, should be insisting on a midfielder as the priority. Don’t have another £100m? Fine. Don’t use all of your cash on three forwards. Absolute madness.",
      "",
      "It now looks as though Ratcliffe has missed the resignation boat as Amorim has now dug his philosophical heels into the Old Trafford turf, insisting after the 3-0 defeat to Manchester City that “If they [United hierarchy] want it [the philosophy] changed, you change the man.”",
      "But he had at least one opportunity to get rid of Amorim without the need for compensation, instead opting to talk Amorim down from the ledge following the 3-1 defeat to Brighton in January when he was ‘prepared to resign’, and reports after the embarrassing defeat to Grimsby Town claimed there was once again a ‘feeling at the club that the head coach may resign unless results pick up’.",
      "It suggests little more than a nudge in that direction may have been required to bring his doomed tenure to an end.",
      "",
      "It was very, very funny, and embarrassing to the point where Ratcliffe must have considered ploughing on with a guy he clearly had no time or respect for as sporting director purely to avoid the humiliation.",
      "They spent no little time and money to haul him out of Newcastle, only to mutually consent him out the door after just five months in which the club spent £180m on players who have made next to no difference to their fortunes and hired a new manager who’s now as doomed as the one they got rid of.",
      "Amorim’s appointment was supposedly the big disagreement between Ashworth, Omar Berrada and the rest of the United brains trust, with Ashworth wanting either an English coach (Gareth Southgate specifically), Thomas Frank or for Ruud van Nistelrooy to stay in interim charge until the end of the season. He knew his stuff, eh?",
      "‘Who would you appoint if we sacked Erik ten Hag now?’ should have been the very first question in Ashworth’s interview.",
      "",
      "Handing someone who had just overseen the worst season in the club’s history a contract extension is one of the worst decisions made by anyone ever. They played well once, in the FA Cup final, having embarrassed themselves in the semi-final against Coventry, the entire Champions League campaign and the vast majority of their league fixtures. Manchester United were awful.",
      "Their excuse for not replacing Ten Hag being the lack of suitable alternatives was quickly exposed as nonsense given the manager they’ve now hired was so available in the summer that he flew to London to meet West Ham on the eve of his side’s crunch clash with Porto in their title run-in.",
      "",
      "We were told that Jason Wilcox, brought in as the new technical director, would be the man to ‘determine and drive the move to a clear “game model” – effectively a cohesive playing style and identity United intend to replicate across all age groups.’",
      "And apparently, unbelievably, after ‘providing a detailed assessment of Ten Hag’s strengths and weaknesses’ as the first duty in his new post, Wilcox reported back that not only was Ten Hag the right man for the job, he was also so good at his job that the club should continue to sign players to fit his system rather than individuals with a broader ethos in mind.",
      "Wilcox and the other directors may claim it’s a happy coincidence that the style of their former first-team coach was also the new Manchester United Way, though wouldn’t be at all surprised if the new Manchester United Way is actually more in line with Amorim’s ethos, which has required a host of his players rather than the bunch bought for Ten Hag that clearly aren’t fit for purpose as the perpetual cycle of Red Devils managers being five to six signings away from challenging for the title continues.",
      "",
      "Ashworth ‘warned’ them and they didn’t listen. He correctly foresaw that there would be ‘mass disruption’ if Amorim and his very specific ideas and playing style arrived mid-season. He must have spent the subsequent 14 months p*ssing himself as that disruption continued unabated until and beyond the Portuguese manager’s demise.",
      "Ashworth wanted to ‘minimise upheaval’ after the squad had already had to adjust to a new backroom team under Ten Hag before being told to forget all that and to get used to a system most of them had never played before, with no time for adaptation and games coming thick as well as fast.",
      "Liverpool had considered Amorim but went for Slot as the Portuguese manager’s ‘three at the back and general philosophy jarred with the squad’. United made no such consideration having cared only about Amorim’s impressive ‘aura’. Boy are they regretting that now.",
      "Ratcliffe wanted United to be ‘chest out and bold’ and was ‘desperate for charisma’. Little did he know that that’s apparently all Amorim has, and that it cannot counter well over a year of underperformance, even with hundreds of millions spent.",
      "Amorim told the club that he wanted to wait and join in the summer, but Berrada told him it was ‘now or never’. If offered the chance to choose again, both parties would definitely choose the latter.",
      "But ultimately the failure of Amorim can be tracked back to Ratcliffe and his peers in the boardroom. They rushed through appointing him in November 2024 and sacked him in January 2026, spending pretty much every intervening second trying to convince themselves publicly and privately that they had cracked it while actually writing off at least a couple of seasons and likely far more considering how so many of their decisions on the playing squad alone were inextricably tied to suiting the ideals of an obstinate head coach who is no longer there.",
      "Add it to the extensive personal list of Ratcliffe’s football ownership “cock-ups”. Someone get him a copy of Football Manager so he can get all this out of his system.",

No denying that this season does represent one in which Arteta might completely lose the plot and go entirely off the rails. Or the one where he wins the league by 10 points. Feels like we’re odds-on to get one or the other.",
      "Arsenal emerged duly unscathed, and cashed in on the shift to easier fixtures of their own alongside much tougher ones for Liverpool to take top spot and control in the Premier League.",

They would at that point find themselves slap bang in the muck of a relegation scrap; instead they have lifted themselves back into the mid-table morass where – luckily for them – absolutely nobody is any good at all and the chance of re-establishing themselves in there and even emerging out the top was very real indeed.",

      "Impossible to avoid the conclusion that Slot’s reaction to Liverpool’s mini-crisis becoming actual-crisis was poor. He went Full Klopp with his salty loser behaviour when Manchester United committed the crime of altering their tactics to give themselves the best chance of success against Liverpool, and the headloss continued after another chaotic and unstructured performance led to a 3-2 defeat at Brentford.",

      "And then there was a new nadir against PSV. That really was very, very bad. West Ham were wonderfully welcoming hosts on Sunday, but to such an inexplicable extent that it’s hard to know just how much to read into Liverpool’s 2-0 win at the London Stadium against opponents who were barely there. Predictably, they were poor in a 1-1 against proper team Sunderland and showed no backbone in the collapse at Leeds United, which was then followed by a distinctly unwelcome MO SALAH BOMBSHELL that does leave things looking distinctly like either he or the manager will have to go.",
      "A run of four consecutive wins cools the immediate temperatures, but it does all feel extremely precarious. The wins over Spurs and Wolves have lacked any real authority.",
      "",
      "Has done more than could ever have been expected given the chaos he walked into. That epic pants-pulling at Anfield and joyful spangling of Tottenham should be enough to buy any manager coming into a relegation-haunted club serious time.",

It’s hurting him and Bournemouth now but they still – for now, just about – remain outside the real relegation scrap and that’s impressive enough on the back of such a challenging summer.",
      "But could really, really do with starting another of the ‘Champions League form’ runs quite soon. A second December draw against Chelsea could be the start of something, but they urgently need a win. Arsenal as the first game of 2026 isn’t ideal; Dr Tottenham straight after it absolutely is.",

      "Nailed it in the Community Shield, but as ever for clubs on Palace’s level there’s a positive-and-negative scale to be balanced by your manager catching the eye so conspicuously. Glasner absolutely could be poached with bigger beasts surely paying attention to the work he’s done at Selhurst Park.",
      "And if that poaching comes from outside the Premier League, then it comes with the possibility of making Glasner the next Premier League managerial casualty. But still very unlikely.",
      "We’d imagine the significant lowering of the threat level for a Ruben Amorim Sack at United eased some nerves at Selhurst Park, but the significant raising of the threat level for an Arne Slot Sack at Liverpool or even Thomas Frank Sack at Spurs has them looking a bit nervous once more. For more than one reason, it’s vital Palace don’t lose Glasner to someone as ropey as Spurs. Although losing an actual Premier League match to someone as ropey as Spurs was also quite careless.",
      "",
      "The hard-nosed yet valid argument persists that Leeds could and perhaps should have taken drastic action in the summer even after their very good week. It would have made Spurs’ decision to sack Europa League-winning Ange Postecoglou look positively kind, Leeds – and Burnley for that matter – might now be better off had they thanked the managers who secured 100 Championship points and got them back into the big time and then sent them on their way.",
      "Farke had a dreadful Premier League record of only six wins and 26 points from his 49 games in charge of Norwich, a team he twice led to promotion from the Championship with 94 and 97 points.",
      "As well as fighting his own record in this competition, Farke faced the added burden of expectation levels very different to those at just about any other club that could possibly find itself promoted into the Premier League in this current era where that represents the most bittersweet of successes.",
      "Defeat at Burnley was honking, but bouncing back to win another six-pointer against West Ham eased the stress significantly before a paddling at Brighton and events elsewhere – including West Ham themselves – left Farke desperately short of immediate cover before a desperately poor show in a six-pointer at Nottingham Forest.",
      "Another painful defeat having gone in front, against Villa this time, saw Leeds drop into the bottom three ahead of a brutal run of games, but that run has gone surprisingly well. The narrow loss to Man City preceded a rare home win against Chelsea and comeback draw against Liverpool.",
      "The question now is whether Leeds and Farke have really hit on something sustainable, or this is merely delaying the inevitable. After the 4-1 win against Crystal Palace and a very decent point at Sunderland, it really does start to look like it might be the latter which has enormous repercussions for both Farke and several other names around him on this list.",
      "",
      "There have been good days and bad, and our whole pondering of Frank’s situation at Spurs has been about determining which of the two would eventually win out. The harrowing NLD-PSG-Fulham week was the first time he really did look f*cked.",
      "Spurs were timid and abysmal in the North London Derby, the second big London derby in a row which Frank had approached more in the manner of a League One manager attempting to avoid a paddling in the FA Cup third round than a legitimate rival facing a familiar foe.",
      "There was some encouragement in a 5-3 Champions League defeat at PSG, but even the very fact it’s possible to write the words ‘some encouragement in a 5-3 Champions League defeat’ is in its own way damning.",
      "But at least those two defeats came against what genuinely might be the two best teams in Europe at this time. With all due respect to Fulham and the sterling work of Marco Silva in recent years, they are not one of the two best teams in Europe at this time, and they were still much better than Spurs who torpedoed themselves inside the opening seven minutes to extend their extraordinarily – and in fairness largely pre-Frank – awful home record in the Premier League to three wins in 21 games since an increasingly odd-looking 4-1 win over Aston Villa in November last year.",
      "Frank’s response to the booing of Guglielmo Vicario after his hideous blunder was firmly in the ‘That’s true, but he shouldn’t say it’ category. And the way he went about it was all wrong.",
      "There should have been some acknowledgement that the booing of Vicario, unsavoury and unhelpful as it may have been, did not burst forth from a clear blue sky but instead a bubbling frustration from fans who pay among the highest ticket prices in the country to watch what is now among the worst and least effective football in the country.",
      "To instead label those supporters – and the boos did not come from a tiny minority inside the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium – not real Spurs fans was another gaffe that pushes the manager further towards the exit.",
      "Until that point we’d felt the obvious comparisons between Thomas Frank and Nuno Espirito Santo didn’t quite fit.",
      "But it’s certainly starting to look uncomfortably similar in familiar ways; the small-time approach to big games has not been well received and the fear grows that he just doesn’t understand what this job requires. The fact almost no manager in Premier League history has managed to understand what this job requires is cold comfort at this time.",
      "However, from there Spurs went to Newcastle and got a draw (albeit a ludicrous one) before they had a dominant 2-0 win against Frank’s old club Brentford, which everyone at Spurs sorely needed. It was easily their most convincing Premier League performance since the win at City on matchday two and a result that could have been even more compelling.",
      "They then pretty much secured a Champions League play-off round spot at the very least with a fine 3-0 win over Slavia Prague.",
      "But Spurs are Spurs, so they followed that with the worst performance yet of Frank’s reign in a truly inept and miserable 3-0 defeat at Nottingham Forest.",
      "Bringing Joao Palhinha and Ben Davies on to try and hold on to a 2-0 defeat and not even managing that feels uncomfortably like the infamous Nuno Moment against Manchester United.",
      "Have reached the kind of state where a dreadful home defeat to a very poor Liverpool is being dressed up as ‘signs of encouragement’. In reality, it might have been the worst possible result; still a defeat, yet one that risks extending the increasingly obviously doomed reign of the latest manager to be chewed up and spat out by the country’s most preposterous football club.",
      "The win at Palace was welcome if deeply unconvincing, while the sheer small-timery of a mind-meltingly dull goalless draw at Brentford really might have hurt Frank more than any of the many, many defeats.",

      "This piece on Ruben Amorim and Manchester United was published on November 25 in the aftermath of their defeat at home to ten-man Everton.",
      "It is no less relevant now he has finally gone. We were exactly a month out on the date.",
      "When David Moyes said Manchester United “must improve in a number of areas”, he listed three facets of their game. Or, well, the entire sport: “Passing, creating chances and defending.”",
      "He did not cite whipping balls into the box. Little wonder, as exactly two months later his team was breaking the record for the most crosses attempted by a team in a single Premier League game.",
      "Rene Meulensteen called the Manchester United approach “quite straightforward” and “easy to defend against”. Dan Burn had “never headed that many balls since the Conference” and was “happy for them to play like that”. Darren Bent “knew that was going to happen” and was also “happy for them to play like that,” having had as many touches in his own box as the opposition’s despite scoring a last-minute equaliser.",
      "And Moyes admitted it was “as bad as it gets”, with his P45 ultimately swung in 72 days after those 81 crosses epitomised his reign.",
      "This was worse. This was weeks of steadily building progress completely squandered, and Ruben Amorim’s most damaging proclivities coming to the fore again.",
      "It was Moyes securing his first ever Premier League win as a visiting manager at Old Trafford in 18 attempts dating back to 2002, Manchester United suffering their first ever Premier League home defeat after seeing the opposition have a player sent off, and Everton not failing to have a single shot after their goal, but instead rather sagely identifying the distinct lack of any need to try.",
      "They had Idrissa Gueye dismissed for a baffling moment of self-destruction in the 13th minute but produced a performance of determined grit and organised obduracy which had both managers praising the infighting post-match.",
      "MORE ON THE MANCHESTER UNITED MESS FROM F365\n👉 Neville slammed for ‘thinking he’s second coming of Guardiola’ with verdict of ‘ambling’ star\n👉 Amorim ‘furious’ with two stars for ‘completely disregarding instructions’ vs Everton\n👉 Ruben Amorim ‘asking for’ sack with Manchester United tactics v 10-man Everton",
      "“I quite like when my players have a fight,” said Moyes, resisting the obvious temptation to say only that the situation would be handled internally. “I don’t want them to accept someone not doing well enough.”",
      "“I hope my players, when they lose the ball, they fight each other,” Amorim added.",
      "But when the Portuguese also describes it as “my fault” that said players “didn’t understand the moments of the game during the 90 minutes,” and that he needs to better “explain to the players how to play in every situation of the game,” it is difficult to see how Casemiro scrapping with Matthijs de Ligt over a misplaced pass would help.",
      "At least Jose Mourinho controlled the “brain” if not the body of only Luke Shaw, the manager “making every decision” for a player who “cannot play with my understanding of the game”.",
      "Amorim has taken on that responsibility for an entire team which apparently cannot think for itself even when confronted by an opponent with one win in four games, reduced to ten men for 77 minutes and without a win of any kind at that stadium since December 2013, during the mess of the Moyes season when it felt like a team would record their first win at Old Trafford in decades every other week.",
      "If this group needs a coach to issue reminders about the need to raise their intensity and diversify their course of attack somewhat against a team down one player then it is yet again difficult to envisage quite how this arrangement ultimately works.",
      "Manchester United put in 38 crosses against Everton, bringing into question Amorim’s claim about having spent the international break watching what opposition managers do before coming to the conclusion that James Tarkowski and Michael Keane might struggle under an aerial assault.",
      "That is not even close to touching those absurd numbers posted against Fulham but still nine more than their previous season high across 120 minutes on that miserable evening at Grimsby, and their most in a Premier League game since October 2018.",
      "That was when Mourinho was to be sacked regardless of the result delivered against Newcastle, only for Alexis Sanchez to grant him a stay of execution with a last-minute winner in a wretched game.",
      "Mourinho was finally shown the door 73 days later, lasting about 24 hours longer than Moyes after he bore those 81 crosses.",
      "Perhaps that represents a harbinger of doom for Amorim, whose rollercoaster would finally end on February 5 going by that timeline. Manchester United’s last match before that execution date being at home to Fulham is almost too narratively satisfying.",
      "This was every bit as desperate as those displays under patently doomed managers, every inch as uninspiring a gameplan and reaction. That it was so thoroughly exposed by Moyes, long but no longer the poster boy for Manchester United’s era of sustained failure post-Ferguson, was most damning of all.",
      "The list of things Manchester United must improve remains painfully long more than a decade later; despite that slight recent upturn, the manager is still towards the top of it after all these years.",
      "Crystal Palace boss Oliver Glasner has reportedly been identified as the top target to replace Ruben Amorim at Man Utd with four names on their list.",

      "“It’s going to be like this for 18 months or when the board decided to change. That was my point. I want to finish with that. I’m not going to quit. I will do my job until other guy is coming here to replace me.",
      "“I just want to say that I’m going to be the manager of this team, not just the coach. I was really clear on that. That is going to finish in 18 months, and then everyone is going to move on. That was the deal. That is my job, not to be a coach.”",

      "Man Utd sit sixth in the Premier League despite winning just three of their last 11 matches and Jacobs has revealed the four main reasons why the Red Devils chose to sack Amorim on Monday.",
      "The former CBS Sports journalist wrote on X: ‘BREAKING: Ruben Amorim has been sacked by Manchester United after his outburst following the 1-1 draw with Leeds. Darren Fletcher to take interim charge. As revealed last night, tension over a lack of alignment in the market and a breakdown between Amorim and Jason Wilcox.’",

      "‘Manchester United back the squad to achieve their objectives this season, including getting European football. Manchester United insiders insist Amorim was aligned in adding three forwards over a midfielder last summer, especially knowing they are versatile.",
      "‘And whoever replaces Amorim will still be a head coach not a manager. No coach will ever sit above the leadership team, or be given a recruitment veto like Erik ten Hag, as Manchester United’s model is collaborative.’",
      "Before news of Amorim’s sacking, Man Utd legend Rooney reacted to his rant and insisted that the Portuguese boss shouldn’t “be speaking with that authority” when he hasn’t achieved anything at Old Trafford.",
      "When asked about Amorim’s comments, Rooney responded on his BBC Sport show: “It’s strange, interesting. I think his choice of words are decisive, confusing. I think he speaks with a confidence and an authority that he knows he’s going to be there as manager (for the next 18 months) and he’s going to remain the manager.",
      "“And that’s the only reason I can assume that he speaks with that belief because the last two games haven’t been very good. It’s quite confusing.",
      "“I don’t think he’ll have 18 more months if it carries on, I think that’s fair to say. I think you need to earn the right to be able to dictate exactly what happens at a football club, especially a football club like Manchester United.",
      "“If [Pep] Guardiola comes into United for instance, I don’t think anyone would question what players he wants to bring in, or the system.",
      "“I feel for him (Amorim) a little bit because the squad is not good enough, the players he’s got on the bench are young academy kids – it’s great to see them on the bench, but are they ready at this moment in time? It’s very difficult to put young players onto a football pitch when the team is not very good, so I feel for him a little bit.”",
      "“But he’s not Pep Guardiola or Jurgen Klopp – he hasn’t got that history or that background, so I don’t think he should be speaking with that authority in what he is and I just think the words he’s saying are very confusing to me.”",

      "Ruben Amorim is unsurprisingly the first Premier League manager – and probably manager of any kind – to be sacked for conceding a goal to Brenden Aaronson.",
      "The following is a rundown of the players who scored in a Premier League manager’s last game before losing their job. Sackings, resignations and mutual consents are all considered, provided there was one clear result which proved to be the tipping point. And it had to happen during the season, not in the summer.",
      "On the rare occasion a manager left his post after winning, we will take into account their most recent defeat; we only want results so damaging that the manager in question had to go soon after. To use Frank Lampard’s 2021 Chelsea exit as an example, his final match was an FA Cup win over Luton so the previous game, a 2-0 defeat to Leicester in which Wilfred Ndidi and James Maddison were the scorers, will be used. Same for Daniel Farke, who left Norwich after beating Brentford in November of that year, with the Raphinha and Rodrigo-inspired loss to Leeds in his penultimate match cited as key.",
      "A total of 252 different players have induced one manager exit by scoring at least once in their final game. This number includes such names as Celestine Babayaro (Kenny Dalglish, Newcastle), Jon Flanagan (Andre Villas-Boas, Spurs), Vinnie Jones (Ron Atkinson, Aston Villa), Gary O’Neil (Peter Reid, Leeds), Arturo Vidal (Roberto Di Matteo, Chelsea), and Aaronson, who helped put Ruben Amorim out of his and Manchester United’s misery.",

      "The Manchester United job is a poisoned chalice. They have tried their hand at former players, iconic managers and one of Sir Alex Ferguson’s mates since the Scot retired, with Ruben Amorim the latest to fail miserably.",
      "It has ended in tears for every single one. With that in mind, we have ranked all seven permanent managers since Fergie left Man Utd after winning the Premier League in 2013.",
      "",
      "Virtually from start to finish, Amorim‘s reign at Man Utd has been shambolic, dragging the fallen Premier League giants to an embarrassing new low last season.",
      "The 15th-place finish in 2024/25 is the main reason for Amorim landing in this position, with performances and results never worse post-Ferguson than during the Portuguese head coach’s ill-fated 14 months at Old Trafford.",
      "Co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe and Man Utd’s recruitment team also have serious questions to answer, but Amorim has not helped himself in the slightest by naively sticking with his failing system, despite it being proven in recent weeks that his squad operates better in another formation.",
      "Amorim’s refusal to change has seen him die on his sword at Man Utd, with his berating of his players and pundits doing nothing to help his situation, especially with such little evidence of progress during his tenure.",
      "He should not have lasted this long, but four reasons behind his overdue demise leave his successor with an extremely low bar to overcome.",
      "READ: Who will be the next Man Utd manager?",
      "",
      "On one hand, you can say Moyes was always destined to fail given the monumental challenge of replacing Ferguson, but he still inherited a Premier League-winning squad and turned them into a group of players incapable of challenging for Champions League qualification.",
      "The Man Utd board put a lot of faith in the appointment of Ferguson’s fellow Scot and managerial friend, handing him a whopping six-year contract having been recommended the appointment by Fergie himself. He lasted a grand total of 10 months after a silly amount of defeats and the Red Devils finished seventh in the Premier League.",
      "At least he managed to beat Wigan Athletic in the Community Shield. Every cloud.",
      "",
      "Man Utd brought in gegenpressing extraordinaire Rangnick to help steady the ship following the sacking of Ole Gunnar Solskjaer in 2021/22. His appointment was made with the view of him stepping into a role behind the scenes, where he appeared to be better suited. Ten Hag had other ideas, though, and did not give the thought of working with Rangnick the time of day when he arrived from Ajax in May 2022.",
      "Rangnick’s time at Old Trafford epitomised the colossal mess at the club. He only took the manager job to become a consultant months later, which he probably would have been excellent at, only for him to leave before getting the chance, swiftly becoming Austria manager after entering free agency.",
      "The German spoke well – almost too well at times – saying the sort of thing the Manchester United hierarchy did not want to hear. His “open-heart surgery” claim had a brutal truth to it and did not go down well.",
      "On the pitch, results did not improve following Rangnick’s arrival and United ended up finishing sixth in the league, 13 points off fourth.",
      "",
      "Ten Hag should have been sacked at the end of last season after the club’s worst finish in Premier League history. An unlikely FA Cup final win over Manchester City saved him and after speaking to a few managers, Sir Jim Ratcliffe decided to extend the Dutchman’s contract after he and his minions swallowed his mitigation around injuries.",
      "It proved to be the silly decision we all knew it was at the time. The summer transfer window was filled with promise but none of the new faces have impressed and the football did not improve. In fact, you could say it somehow got worse. That home defeat to Tottenham turned every Man Utd fan’s stomach.",
      "Ten Hag won the Carabao Cup in his first campaign, which went along nicely with a top-three finish in the league and an FA Cup final, which his side lost to Man City. His second season was a direct contrast: beating Pep Guardiola’s side at Wembley after shambling their way to eighth in the Premier League.",
      "The 2023/24 Champions League campaign was truly awful, finishing bottom of a group when it seemed harder than finishing first. Their Carabao Cup defence ended painfully when the Red Devils were hammered Newcastle United – the team they beat in the previous season’s final – at home, and results in the Premier League were mind-bogglingly inconsistent.",
      "Still, on paper, two trophies in two seasons is a fine return. On grass, it was a different story. Ten Hag’s dismissal was inevitable and a sign that Ratcliffe might not be as clued up as Man Utd fans had hoped.",
      "",
      "Van Gaal benefits from leaving Man Utd at the right time. What a character he was, though. From his rants in press conferences to throwing himself on the ground in remonstration to the fourth official after an alleged Alexis Sanchez dive, Van Gaal brought light to Our League and for that, we will forever be grateful.",
      "While the experienced Dutch manager entertained the masses with his antics, his football – which does have an element of importance – left a lot to be desired. He was very pragmatic and adopted the patient, possession-based approach that has served him well throughout his career. That is the nice way of putting it. More bluntly, it was dull as f***.",
      "Said style did bring an FA Cup to Old Trafford, the first trophy post-Fergie. And the club’s hierarchy were so thankful to Van Gaal that they decided to sack him straight after the Wembley triumph.",
      "",
      "Say what you want about the man. Take into account all of the semi-final defeats. Do whatever you want, mate. We don’t care. Man Utd played their best football post-Fergie under Solskjaer, who was sacked in November 2021 after a hammering at Watford.",
      "The club legend got the job full-time after a mightily impressive spell as caretaker boss that included an iconic Champions League comeback away to Paris Saint-Germain, to which Rio Ferdinand reacted in a completely normal manner, saying on BT Sport after the result:",
      "Man United might not thank me, but get the contract out, put it on the table, let him sign it, let him write whatever numbers he wants to put on there – given what he’s done since he’s come in – and let him sign the contract and go. Ole’s at the wheel, man – he’s doing his thing. Man United are back!",
      "In fairness, we all egged Man Utd on. He was at the wheel during his caretaker stint but Ole eventually crashed and burned.",
      "Solskjaer did bring the best out of Bruno Fernandes, giving him the freedom to express himself and the Portuguese thrived as a result. He even made Anthony Martial look like a competent footballer. The comeback wins, counter-attacking football, and incredible 20-minute spurts in games when United would kill the opposition were the highlights of a fun time with the Norwegian at the helm.",
      "",
      "The Special One got the job after Van Gaal’s sacking and has been the most successful boss since Ferguson retired in 2013. Again, his football was far from incredible to watch but it provided results and this is a results business.",
      "His first season saw Paul Pogba and Zlatan Ibrahimovic shine as the Red Devils won the Carabao Cup, the Europa League and finished sixth in the Premier League, which was insignificant as Europa glory brought the club Champions League football anyway.",
      "The following season brought two-time Champions League-winning manager Mourinho the “greatest achievement of his career”: finishing second in the Premier League, 19 points behind centurions Manchester City.",
      "As it usually does, things went sour in Mourinho’s third season in charge, losing his job in December 2018, which saw Solskjaer take charge.",

      "",
      "The gloves have been making the short trip across the River Tyne all season, as Nick Pope has shared custody largely thanks to a relatively impressive six clean sheets in 14 games.

      "As for Aston Villa’s Morgan Rogers; WhoScored rate him as the 37th best player in the Premier League this season. Why? His pass completion rate is poor, he contributes very little defensively and only one player in the whole top flight loses the ball more often from a poor touch.",

      "He said: “I just want to say that I’m going to be the manager of this team, not the just the coach, and I was really clear on that.",
      "“That is going to finish in 18 months and then everyone is going to move on. That is the deal, that is my job, not to be a coach.",
      "“If people cannot handle the Gary Nevilles and the criticisms of everything, we need to change the club.”",

      "Now, a report from journalist Graeme Bailey for our pals at TEAMtalk has shed light on Man Utd’s ‘contingency plan’, with it claimed that they have ‘two options’ to replace Amorim",
      "He explained: ‘One of those, who would likely be a short-term option, is Michael Carrick. The former Middlesbrough man has previously served in the coaching set-up and is held in huge regard by the club. We are told that the club would like him to be involved again at some point in the future.",

Because he’s not good enough. He’s not good enough to be Manchester United’s manager. He’s barely competent enough to be a Premier League manager right now.”",
      "Pressed on what might be the cause of Amorim’s gripes, Carragher suggested: “It can only be two things. It can either be about the January transfer market, that he’s not being backed. Or the people above him are questioning that he’s flip-flopping between systems.",
      "“It started to look like he was getting somewhere with a back four, he went back to a five at the back against Wolves and it was possibly the worst performance from a team we’ve seen against Wolves this season.”",
      "Former Man Utd defender Neville insists that “there’s no real need for a fire right now but there’s a fire being created” at Old Trafford.",
      "Neville continued: “Obviously, something is annoying him, he’s obviously not feeling the support. He’s obviously letting go. When you say that you came to the club as a manager, I thought he was appointed as the head coach and quite clearly appointed to coach the team.",
      "“Manager is a title that we don’t see anymore. Manager suggests that he’s saying he wants to manage more than just the training ground performance, he wants to oversee other parts of the club.",
      "“I played under a manager and they basically have a greater say in what would be other parts of the club including recruitment, academy, style of play, pre-season friendlies and other things.",
      "“I think he’s suggesting that he needs to be given the ability to manage more departments of the club.",
      "“I actually thought against Leeds, defensively United were very strong. I thought they were very solid in the game I thought they handled the atmosphere well. I thought they fully deserved the point out of the game that’s why I was surprised at the end to hear of Ruben Amorim’s comments because I thought you’ve got a point away from home.",
      "“You’ve just had a disastrous result against Wolves at home but there’s Burnley to go in three days, there’s no real need for a fire right now but there’s a fire being created.",
      "“He’s always been authentic, he’s always had integrity in his press conferences. He’s always said what he believes and he thinks and he should do, he should carry on as he was but it does look like he’s now starting to point upwards which ordinarily does bring pressure with it.”",

      "Liverpool were paid £174.9m as champions – short of Manchester City’s record £176.2m in 2022/23 – while Newcastle received just over £160m to chuck into their PSR black hole.",
      "Southampton were handed £109.2m for their efforts in finishing a distant bottom. It pays to be in the Premier League.",

All 20 clubs automatically receive around £96.9m through an equal share distributed based on both the domestic (£29.8m in 2024/25) and international (£59.2m in 2024/25) broadcast deals – those TV rights are lucrative for a reason – as well as £7.9m each from central commercial revenue streams.",

Arsenal had 29 matches and were paid £24.2m, while Manchester United (28 games for £23.4m), Aston Villa (27 games for £22.6m) and Chelsea (26 games for £21.8m) were televised frequently and rewarded handsomely.",
      "Ipswich were shown on the fewest occasions and received £8.9m in facility fees for their 10 live televised UK fixtures.",
      "This can lead to discrepancies in terms of those variable payments. Manchester United’s prize money after finishing 15th last season was £136.2m, more than the four clubs immediately above them – West Ham (£130.9m in 14th), Everton (£131.8m in 13th), Crystal Palace (£136.1m in 12th) and Fulham (£135.5m in 11th) – as Ruben Amorim’s side were picked for far more live TV games.",
      "Spurs were another massive outlier, earning more in 17th (£127.8m) than Wolves did in 16th (£123.1m) in part because they had nine more games picked for live UK broadcast.",

      "Man Utd boss Ruben Amorim has insisted that he will be a “manager, not coach” at Old Trafford as promised on his arrival at Old Trafford.",
      "The Red Devils continued their inconsistent form on Sunday with a 1-1 draw against Leeds United at Elland Road.",
      "A clinical Matheus Cunha finish got Man Utd back on level terms on 65 minutes, just three minutes after Leeds attacker Brenden Aaronson took advantage of an Ayden Heaven mistake to give the Yorkshire side the lead.",
      "The nature of division means that the Red Devils are likely to finish the day only a few points from the bottom half of the Premier League.",
      "Amid reports of tension between Amorim and director of football Jason Wilcox, the Man Utd boss gave a clear warning to the board.",
      "READ: Man Utd don’t lose at Leeds and that’s just fine for negative Ruben Amorim",
      "Speaking in his post-match press conference, Amorim said: “I came here to be the manager of Manchester United, not to be the head coach. I know my name is not Conte, Tuchel, Mourinho but I’m the manager of Manchester United.",
      "“It’s going to be like this for 18 months or until the board decide to change. I’m not going to quit. I’ll do my job until another guy is coming here to replace me.”",
      "Reacting to his side’s performance against Leeds, the Man Utd boss said: “In the Premier League, it is hard to find a game you are satisfied with a draw, that is why it is an amazing league.",
      "“Overall, if you see the game we had more control. We created more chances, we controlled well, so if you look at the game you feel the frustration that we had the chance to win. It is a tough match in tough conditions.",
      "“The game plan was to understand what we did wrong against Wolves. We improved a lot because we were in the right positions. We improved from the last game.",
      "“It’s strange because they started a little bit better in the second half. When we are in control, we need to be focused in every detail. We know against West Ham, we are in control then one disconnection, there was a goal. We need to be connected all the time.",
      "“We managed to control our emotions and to score the next goal, and we had a big chance. I think we deserved a little better, but it’s okay.”",
      "“We had our opportunities to win the game. We are losing games on the details – the Leeds goal, we are controlling the game and then one kick of the ball in transition but we managed to get back into the game. Last year it would be completely different. This year we are more in control of the games than we were last year but we are frustrated not to win.”",
      "On the Leeds goal, the Man Utd boss continued: “Ayden and Leny are really young but it is not because of that. If you play so well during 90m minutes and you have a mistake that can happen. If you look at the game we had chances to score the second one and nobody would be talking about the goal of Leeds.”",
      "On goalscorer Cunha, he said: “Not just him but Josh [Zirkzee] played well in the 20 minutes he had, Ben [Sesko] linked the play well today, Ugarte is showing that he has more to give, and I am really pleased. If these guys play well we always have the chance to win the game.”",
      "When asked about the January transfer window, he replied: “United is one of the best clubs in the world. If you are here and focusing on a different club then something is wrong with you. Just focus on the game and prepare with the players that we have. We have more too, I expect more minutes for Fernandes and Mount, so we have more players that can help us.”",
      "Crystal Palace boss Oliver Glasner has reportedly been identified as the top target to replace Ruben Amorim at Man Utd with four names on their list.",
      "Man Utd made the decision to sack Ruben Amorim before their 1-1 draw against Leeds on Sunday afternoon, according to reports.",
      "We’ve limited ourselves to just the 20 reasons for Manchester United finally deciding to sack Ruben Amorim. That’s 58 points from 47 games and 19 more…",

      "Chelsea parting ways with Enzo Maresca leaves Nuno Espirito Santo in a familiar position as the Sack Race favourite…",
      "Ruben Amorim managed Manchester United for 14 months and spent a ludicrous amount of money to leave them exactly where he found them."

      "Manchester United have only drawn 0-0 once since Ruben Amorim’s arrival. For an hour against Leeds United, it appeared they were heading for another, a result Amorim’s team selection suggested he would have accepted before kick-off.",
      "There was plenty of criticism of Amorim’s starting XI at Elland Road as he lined up with eight defensive players in his adored 3-4-2-1 formation. Patrick Dorgu, a wing-back, was part of a front three alongside Matheus Cunha and an out-of-form Benjamin Sesko, whose poor touches, finishing and hold-up play epitomised his difficult acclimatisation from the Bundesliga to the Premier League. To be fair to him, he’s not alone.",
      "Amorim knows Leeds don’t have incredible quality on the ball or the ability to freely play through teams, so selecting more defensive players makes a certain amount of sense. It does, however, make for an awfully dull game of football and points to a mentality problem: ‘don’t lose’ rather than ‘let’s win’. Against a newly promoted team, albeit one in good form, that feels wrong.",
      "That team selection did allow Manchester United greater control, with the back three rarely tested against Premier League form striker Dominic Calvert-Lewin, whose first real sniff at goal came from a free header that hit the post and had half of Elland Road convinced it was in. Leny Yoro ought to have been tighter to the England hopeful and also should have put the visitors 1-0 up with a header of his own, which would have done his confidence the world of good. He needs it.",
      "There wasn’t much to report until Brenden Aaronson’s opening goal in the 62nd minute. Amorim’s XI was a contributing factor, but so too was the kick-off time, something we completely understand given the job West Yorkshire Police would have on their hands if Leeds vs Manchester United were an 8pm fixture.",
      "It was all just a bit flat. Scheduling this fixture as early as possible is understandable, but it was also a bit boring. We are not condoning drunk and disorderly behaviour by any means, but we want these two great rivals to meet in the best atmosphere possible.",
      "MORE F365 SAYS…\n* Arsenal take ‘the next step’ as Arteta pinpoints one player’s ‘personality and presence’ in huge win\n* Nuno sack sealed but West Ham have already given 47 million reasons why he must stay for relegation\n* Thomas Frank doesn’t ‘understand’ Spurs and Brentford stalemate suggests he never will",
      "Elland Road did erupt when Aaronson slotted past Senne Lammens, but the home fans were instantly silenced when Matheus Cunha equalised.",
      "Young Ayden Heaven won’t look back fondly on the American’s goal when it’s analysed on Monday morning, especially after such a solid, composed performance up to that point. Perhaps it was that very composure and confidence that caught him out, as Aaronson bore down on the lackadaisical defender, burst through on goal and finished with his left foot.",
      "Amorim’s reaction was immediate. Joshua Zirkzee came on and provided the assist for Cunha’s finish. When United needed to attack, they scored a brilliant goal and looked good value for a winner. Why couldn’t they have just done this from the start? Everyone’s day would have been far more entertaining.",
      "Zirkzee was one of United’s better players despite only playing 31 minutes, but Cunha was also impressive and scored the decisive equaliser. He was trying to make things happen from the first minute and also struck an exquisite volley that was ruled out for offside against Sesko.",
      "Aaronson’s opener could have sparked the game into life, but Cunha’s swift equaliser burst that bubble. The second half was a better spectacle and became hectic in injury time, but we were still left wanting more from Amorim’s side. A draw ultimately felt like a fair result.",
      "Leeds are now on their best unbeaten run in the Premier League since 2001, extending it to seven games.",
      "United have still only drawn 0-0 once under Amorim, against Manchester City on April 6 at Old Trafford, and 15 of their Premier League games in 2025/26 have seen both teams score. Leeds sit fourth in that particular table. Both delivered with goals at Elland Road, but it wasn’t the game we were hoping for.",

      "The decision to sack Ruben Amorim became inevitable once the Portuguese coach made it clear this was no long-term project but the unravelling of his Manchester United reign damns the decision-makers as well as the coach, writes Adam Bate",
      "Monday 5 January 2026 11:45, UK",
      "The end of yet another error. Manchester United’s decision to sack Ruben Amorim midway through the season leaves the club in rebuild mode for a second consecutive campaign, their commitment to this latest project unceremoniously abandoned.",
      "In March, Sir Jim Ratcliffe had boldly claimed that Amorim was doing a great job. Omar Berrada, the club's chief executive, argued that come the summer the worst would be behind them. As both are belatedly learning, things can always get worse at United.",
      "August brought defeat to fourth-tier opposition for the first time in their history, Amorim unable to watch as United were dumped out of the Carabao Cup by Grimsby. Fiddling with his tactics board that night, he became the face that launched 1,000 memes.",
      "September brought defeat at Brentford, a game which ended with Amorim repeating his experiment of playing Mason Mount at left wing-back. Only October brought some relief, an unexpected win over Liverpool at Anfield and the manager of the month award.",
      "But, in November, they were beaten by Everton at Old Trafford, losing a Premier League home game against 10 men for the first time. In December, they somehow contrived to allow a Wolves team that had lost their previous 12 matches to leave with a point.",
      "It ends in January after a draw at Leeds, conceding in 15 consecutive away games for the first time in Premier League history. Not because of that result but because the relationship between Amorim and those above him had become broken beyond repair.",
      "The realisation of how much work remained was a source of tension. Amorim had been given a new £200m forward line but still wanted more there and in almost every other area of the pitch. His demands came from a weak position as faith in him faded.",
      "Berrada talked of a \"very clear identity\" but even that was being compromised by the end. Having moved on his wingers, he finally switched to a back four - inexplicably suggesting the reason he had not made the change earlier was because of the media.",
      "Even then, after limping to victory over Newcastle in that system, he reverted back and failed to beat Wolves. Gary Neville was frustrated. That Amorim name-checked him after his final game in charge suggests those frustrations were shared within the club.",
      "United's decision-makers will be criticised for this folly and rightly so. The award of a new contract to Erik ten Hag only to sack him in October of last season did not present the best conditions for Amorim to take the job - something he was acutely aware of.",
      "It always came with risk. Liverpool opted against Amorim because of the incompatibility of his formation, going with the greater continuity afforded by appointing Arne Slot and being rewarded with the Premier League title. But Amorim was on their radar.",
      "His reputation had been well earned, having had nothing but success at Portugal, building the best Sporting side for a generation, a first title in 19 years. And there were very good reasons why United were more amenable to change than Liverpool.",
      "Having finished outside the top seven under Ten Hag, there was an appetite among supporters for something more than mere evolution and Ratcliffe was happy to sell that idea. He wanted to disrupt things at Old Trafford and Amorim could be his instrument.",
      "But few could have anticipated it being quite so fraught.",
      "Amorim was afforded extraordinary levels of patience and Ten Hag's own struggles only partially explain it. The Portuguese picked up fewer points in his first six games than the Dutchman had mustered in his last six - and things actually got worse from there.",
      "Amorim averaged a point a game last season across 27 matches, putting them 16th in the table during that period - which is where they finished. Worth a reminder, perhaps, that while United were meandering when he arrived, they were only four points off third.",
      "Failing to qualify for Europe changed the financial picture, slowing the pace of change and making it more difficult for Amorim to overhaul the squad. Although, his unwillingness to trust Kobbie Mainoo had some fans questioning his plans for it anyway.",
      "There were grumbles when he refused to change shape when chasing games, making like-for-like substitutions in the devastating Europa League final defeat to Tottenham. The familiar sight of swapping centre-backs late on bewildered many at Old Trafford.",
      "And yet, United's match-going supporters are a loyal bunch and few will be celebrating his exit. They had hoped against hope that this would work after more than a decade of disappointments. They were willing to trust that all this was actually going somewhere.",
      "It is why, for all his failings, Amorim was undone by his comments as much as the results. Speaking about his relationship with the club in that press room in Leeds, he concluded: \"[It] is going to finish in 18 months and then everyone is going to move on.\"",
      "That laid bare to everyone the fact that this new path that Amorim was on was not leading to a new era, the next United dynasty. In his own words, even if the club were to let him to see out his deal, this project was already nearer to the end than the beginning.",
      "Framed in that context, it was only natural to question the point in proceeding down said path. And so, having tried the big characters, the club heroes, United's investment in this tactical bright young thing has been aborted too. The end of yet another error.",
      "Super 6 have made a millionaire already this season, but could you be the next big winner? Enter the next round for free."

      "Ruben Amorim's sacking was inevitable and predictable.",
      "There was an awful lot of optimism when he first joined - both from the Manchester United bosses and from supporters.",
      "But in truth, he never seemed comfortable in the job.",
      "The United hierarchy were desperate to give him a full season in charge before judging him - partly because of the cost of sacking him, which will now be £12m, but also because of the recurring instability that inevitably happens if you regularly change the man at the top.",
      "Since Sir Alex Ferguson left in 2013, Amorim was the 10th manager to be appointed. But results were so poor, they never afforded the club's bosses, or Amorim, the luxury of time.",
      "Despite spending over £200m on attacking talent in the summer, despite the Portuguese coach having a full pre-season to get his message across, despite many of the statistics pointing to improved performance levels from the team, despite the man himself coping well with the media scrutiny and being well-liked across the board at the club…the results were awful.",
      "Amorim is a decent, honest, hard-working guy. But he had to go.Rob Dorsett",
      "Stubbornness forms the very basis of where many fans will feel Amorim got it wrong. But could the Portuguese head coach's downfall be pinned on a specific decision? Bruno Fernandes' importance to Manchester United goes without saying.",
      "His 100 goals for the club tell a story of the level of consistency and performance he's displayed since arriving at Old Trafford nearly six years ago.",
      "Ask anyone who United's best player is and the majority will reply with Fernandes. However, in the summer, there was an opportunity to move away from him.",
      "Rightly or wrongly, representative of an era at United, Fernandes had an offer to move to Saudi Arabia, which would have seen United potentially make £100m from his departure. That money could have been reinvested to plug United's overstated midfield holes.",
      "Instead, the player became a symbol of Amorim's hard-headed approach. Amorim's insistence on deploying him as one of his two midfielders has hampered United.",
      "As captain, Fernandes is Amorim's go-to in midfield and for the former Sporting coach, he contended for the position with Kobbie Mainoo.",
      "That's a scenario that has seen the England international and a favourite among fans find minutes hard to come by, which hasn't helped Amorim's case with the Old Trafford faithful.",
      "Stubborn by nature, Amorim would tell you he'd make the same decision to keep Fernandes, knowing what would ultimately be his fate. However, it is now clear that Fernandes was the catalyst for Amorim's United demise.William Bitibiri",
      "Amorim has had an uphill task since day one - and that is down to Manchester United's dithering over Erik ten Hag.",
      "The Dutchman looked set to leave after salvaging an FA Cup win at the end of a disappointing 2023/24 season. It was a chance for him to leave on a high and for the club to move on. But instead, after sounding out various alternatives, United decided they could find no better option, so handed Ten Hag a contract extension - and a heap of money in the transfer window.",
      "He was also given a say on who to bring in. \"He did have a voice, which is why there were one or two Dutch players,\" Sir Jim Ratcliffe memorably said. Players Ten Hag had coached at former clubs were also added to the squad.",
      "In summer 2024, Man Utd signed Netherlands internationals Matthijs de Ligt and Joshua Zirkzee, along with Leny Yoro, Noussair Mazraoui - who played for Erik ten Hag at Ajax - and Manuel Ugarte.",
      "Nine games into the new 2024/25 season, the United decision-makers changed their mind again and sacked him before installing Amorim.",
      "A new manager in a new league, trying to implement a new system with players signed for a different manager… what could go wrong?",
      "It now looks like folly not to have given Amorim a full pre-season and transfer window in the summer of 2024 to shift the style of play and approach at the club. The good feeling from the FA Cup win could have provided a welcome launch pad.",
      "\"It was the wrong decision,\" Ratcliffe concluded about the whole Ten Hag mess.",
      "Prior to Amorim's appointment, there were reports he would have preferred to have waited until the end of the season before leaving Sporting for United. If he had been given a full run-in to his first campaign, the transition could have been a whole lot smoother and successful.Peter Smith",
      "Manchester United scored just 44 league goals in 2024/25 - their lowest recorded total since 1973/74, when they were relegated from the First Division - so this summer was about putting a new forward line and in came Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko.",
      "An impressive triple capture, and one that cost £207.2m. It represented a huge outlay for a club without European football, but illustrated just how keen they are to ensure the absence from Europe lasted one season and one season only.",
      "But how costly was it that the midfield was, on the face of it, not treated with the same urgency? Amorim did not sign a single midfielder during his time in charge.",
      "Fernandes is one of the first names on the team sheet, and rightly so, but the options for partners are limited.",
      "It is a similar story in goal. Andre Onana played only three of the last seven league games last year before being loaned out to Trabzonspor. Amorim initially persisted with Altay Bayindir despite the £18.2m arrival of Senne Lammens. Eyebrows were raised with the signing of Lammens, with just 54 league appearances to his name, but he has been United's No 1 since October.",
      "One problem area has been remedied, but a lack of similar work elsewhere has played its part.Dan Long",
      "Amorim, INEOS, the Manchester United squad - nobody comes out of this mess looking good. But spare a thought for 3-4-3.",
      "The mere mention of the formation is likely to induce cold sweats among United fans. The depths their side have plumbed in a bid to get to grips with the system have been so low that some pundits have insisted it can never work in the Premier League.",
      "But that isn't true. Chelsea won the Premier League in 2017 playing 3-4-3. Crystal Palace have enjoyed remarkable success under Oliver Glasner with the system. And let's not forget Amorim's exploits at Sporting using 3-4-3 earned him the Old Trafford job.",
      "The issue was not the system - it was the United squad's inability to perform within it, and Amorim's bizarre refusal to adapt that doomed his reign.",
      "As Adam Bate pointed out here, data analysis suggested 3-4-3 was a long way down the list of formations that suited the squad Amorim inherited. The system requires athletic wing-backs who can contribute in both boxes, versatile No 10s and an effective No 9.",
      "The squad that Amorim took over barely had any of those, yet he ploughed on. Mainoo up front? Fernandes as a No 6? Mason Mount at wing-back? All in service to the system.",
      "Should United's players have done a better job adapting to their head coach's demands? Certainly. Should INEOS have foreseen Amorim's incompatibility with the squad he was being handed? No doubt. And Amorim's refusal to change had long since passed the stage of being self-defeating.",
      "But the 3-4-3 formation has worked before and will work again - just don't expect to see United using it any time soon.Joe Shread",
      "Amorim now joins an ever-growing list of names who have tried - and failed - to drag Manchester United back to their former heights.",
      "David Moyes, Louis van Gaal, Jose Mourinho, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, Ralf Rangnick, Ten Hag and now Amorim.",
      "A list compiled of names with differing levels of experience and success but there is a common theme from their time at Old Trafford. It ultimately did not work.",
      "Rangnick spoke of the \"open heart surgery\" United needed during his time at the club from December 2021 to May 2022 - but what else can be done?",
      "The ownership structure has changed, new head coaches arrived with their own ideas and fresh investment was inserted across all areas of the squad over the years. But the same issues persisted.",
      "At some point, you have to question whether it is possible to replicate Sir Alex Ferguson's success in Manchester almost 13 years ago.",
      "Their former glory, although historic and woven into English football history forever, casts an immediate shadow on those who fill the hot seat and the expectations that come with it, albeit outdated, set them up for failure regardless of formation, signings and results.Patrick Rowe",

      "In this week's edition of The Debrief, Adam Bate looks at Benjamin Sesko's issues in front of goal for Manchester United. Plus: John McGinn's touches in the box for Aston Villa, Jhon Arias' reinvention at Wolves and Max Kilman losing aerial duels for West Ham",
      "Monday 5 January 2026 11:41, UK",
      "Benjamin Sesko delayed his shot in the first half and saw it blocked. He badly mistimed a header from an offside position early in the second half, then side-footed the ball the wrong side of the post from close range. It was a difficult day for the striker at Leeds.",
      "Statistically, he finished the 1-1 draw at Elland Road as the player with the game's best chances but once again failed to find the net. It is perhaps the story of his Manchester United career so far, one that has not yet ignited since his big-money move from Leipzig.",
      "Having started each of the last four games, this is his joint-longest run in the side and Sesko can expect to make it five in a row at Burnley on Wednesday evening.",
      "International commitments have robbed United of Amad Diallo and Bryan Mbeumo in this busy period, but the fixture list was inviting for Sesko. Instead, they have won only one of the last four. Had they beaten Wolves at home and won at Leeds they would now be fourth.",
      "Sesko has had 12 shots in these matches without scoring. The other four men to have had this many shots in the Premier League during this period have each scored at least twice. In terms of non-penalty expected goals, of the top dozen he is the only one not to score.",
      "All of which suggests that Sesko is getting service. There were six attempts on goal against Wolves without seriously testing the goalkeeper. He ranks in the top 12 for non-penalty expected goals per 90 minutes in the Premier League so far this season.",
      "Of the top 20, only three players have underperformed in front of goal by a wider margin than the Manchester United man. Whether that poor return from the chances that he has had is an encouraging sign or a reason for concern is a matter of perspective.",
      "These expected goals numbers are in line with his two seasons in the Bundesliga. In that sense, United are getting what they bought, it is just that those shots have not been going in as often as they did in Leipzig, where his conversion was impressive. That can change.",
      "Perhaps the worry for United is that they hoped for more not less. An investment in potential, Sesko's size and speed meant that he was seen as someone on an upward trajectory who could build on hauls of 14 and 13 in those two seasons as a Bundesliga player.",
      "Instead, as with the admittedly older Viktor Gyokeres at Arsenal, the Premier League has exposed some limitations. Sesko has time on his side and the underlying numbers too. But if this winter was an opportunity for him to step up, it has not yet been seized.",
      "John McGinn is a beloved figure at Aston Villa and at 31 there are not many tricks for him still to be taught. Unai Emery trusts his captain. But that does not mean that the Villa manager cannot demand more. Those demands won the game against Nottingham Forest.",
      "In truth, McGinn did not need to venture into the Forest box to score the points-sealing third goal, finishing from long distance when John Victor went walkabout. But he still had to make the run - just as he did for his first goal, that one coming from inside the penalty area.",
      "McGinn had five touches in the opposition box during the game. That is more than in any other Premier League appearance this season, beating his high of four registered against Brentford back in August. He had settled into a rhythm of staying a little deeper.",
      "What a response. McGinn had not scored twice in a game in the Premier League before, achieving the feat in an Aston Villa shirt for only the second time in all competitions - the other also coming against Forest back in the Championship almost seven years ago.",
      "Emery's reputation for improving players is well established and that ability to coax more from his squad has been a feature of Villa's success under him. McGinn, 311 games into his career with the club, still adding new elements to his game only underlines the point.",
      "Mateus Mane has been the star performer for Wolves of late, the catalyst for their improved performance levels as they picked up their first win of the Premier League season against West Ham. But the recall of his new midfield partner Jhon Arias has been key too.",
      "Arias was an unused substitute in the game prior to Rob Edwards' arrival but has featured in every game under him. He came in to start the draw at Manchester United and then scoring the opening goal - his first in a Wolves shirt - in the defeat of the Hammers at Molineux.",
      "His improved form has come in a new role. Having been signed as a winger, he struggled playing with his back to goal, unable to adapt to the intensity of the Premier League. But injuries and suspensions forced Edwards to look for a new solution at Old Trafford.",
      "Deployed centrally alongside Mane, with Joao Gomes providing protection behind, Arias has been able to find much more space when getting on the ball in deeper areas rather than being restricted to the flank. It has helped him to show more of what he can do.",
      "It has helped Wolves too. The Brazilian duo of Gomes and Andre have Premier League class but as a pair they are not attack-minded enough to threaten the opposition centrally. Neither has scored this season. Arias and Mane, as twin eights, both managed it in one half.",
      "Speaking to Edwards in the press conference after the game, he confessed to having had a sleepless night wondering whether to recall the available again Andre. He opted to stick with Arias and was rewarded. Now he is wondering if he has hit upon something.",
      "\"Potentially,\" acknowledged Edwards. \"I mean, his last two performances have been really good in that more of an eight role, in that deeper role. I think he covers the ground really well. And obviously, he has got a real calmness in possession with the ball.\"",
      "Few expect Arias to stay at Wolves long term and, unlike Mane, it may be that his name will remain synonymous with the club's failings this season. But this belated reinvention is a reminder of his quality. How Wolves will wish they had been able to unlock it sooner.",
      "Nuno Espirito Santo said afterwards that he could not remember a worse day on a football pitch in his long career. Maximilian Kilman might well agree. The West Ham defender endured a miserable game on his return to Molineux, booed by his own team's supporters.",
      "The catalyst was the second Wolves goal. Kilman's clearance was an ugly one, contorting his body into a strange position in failing to deal with the ball into the box. It led to West Ham conceding a penalty from which there proved to be no way back for his team.",
      "But the dissatisfaction with Kilman runs deep. A £40m signing in the summer of 2024, his seven-year contract is now seen as emblematic of West Ham's flawed recruitment strategy. Now 28 years of age, the hope was that Kilman would be a dominant figure at the back.",
      "On Saturday, he was outmuscled by Wolves striker Tolu Arokodare. Kilman lost eight aerial duels to the Nigerian, the most that he has ever lost in a Premier League game for West Ham - although his three worst displays in this regard have all come this season.",
      "At his best, Kilman can be calm and competent in possession but he has never been the most demonstrative of defenders. A popular figure in a mid-table Wolves side, the expectations were rather different when he was a bargain buy from Maidenhead United.",
      "At West Ham, he has become a lightning rod for fan frustration, unable to convince with his body language, sparking accusations of timidity. If Kilman is ever to win over those supporters, he will need to win far more of his aerial duels than he did at Molineux.",

      "They were lacking in cutting edge in the first half at Fulham on the back of the 0-0 at home to Leeds. But Slot believes the issue of chance creation is a separate one.",

      "For much of the game, Cunha had to make things happen on his own, with Benjamin Sesko struggling again. But Zirkzee's introduction gave him a better foil and he was energetic throughout, relishing the physical battle and giving his team an outlet.",
      "\"We tried to do everything to win,\" he said after the game. That was particularly true of man-of-the-match Cunha himself.Nick Wright",
      "Manchester City and Pep Guardiola took a major risk in the summer by not recruiting a specialist left-back and that gamble has not paid off.",
      "Against Chelsea, that decision was stress-tested and ultimately exposed as a huge moment swung the title picture firmly in Arsenal's favour. Malo Gusto was just too quick for a tiring Nico O'Reilly and his cross led to the equalising goal.",
      "O'Reilly has found himself learning on the job this season. A polished midfielder by trade but a left-back by necessity. City can usually protect that kind of compromise with structure and possession. This time, they could not in a decisive moment. O'Reilly got isolated, squared up and beaten by Gusto. That is not an indictment of the player, it is a reminder of how much full-back defending is an art.",
      "Guardiola has always believed that collective organisation can mask individual weaknesses. Most of the time, he is right. But the Premier League is such an unforgiving beast and opposition teams have noticed where City are vulnerable. Chelsea took full advantage.Lewis Jones",
      "You could have easily been lured into thinking this would be the perfect time to play Chelsea. No manager, form on the blink, having dropped 15 points from winning positions so far this season. But the reality at the Eithad was far from what pre-game narratives supposed.",
      "This was not a contest flush with high quality chances but Chelsea made it as difficult as they could before getting the break of luck their determined display deserved. It was a performance stand-in coach Calum McFarlane could be proud of.",
      "Had Enzo Maresca - dismissed three days prior - still been in the hotseat, no doubt he would have echoed similar sentiment post match. McFarlane admitted to being surprised by City's structure in the first half but found the answers in the second, with the introduction of Andrey Santos at half-time adding stability, and latterly Liam Delap for physicality up top. The hustle worked.",
      "Chelsea ended the game with nearly twice the xG value of their hosts and generated three big chances, limiting City to zero of their own. Pep Guardiola said afterwards that none of that surprised him as he considers Maresca to be one of the \"best build-up coaches\" in England. Perhaps that's why he's been linked with eventually succeeding Guardiola at City.",
      "Whatever the case, Chelsea's young squad showed they can be resistant in trying times, a quality that will stand them in good stead for the next chapter of this unpredictable and erratic era.Laura Hunter",
      "\"I think it was definitely possible to win this game.\" Those were Daniel Farke's words after the 1-1 draw with Manchester United. A game that before they met Man City in November, the German may not have been sure he would see.",
      "Such was the scrutiny on his future at the club. But, that second-half performance at the Etihad gave him a lifeline that he took with both hands.",
      "The point in the Roses derby sees Leeds pull eight points clear of the relegation zone thanks to a seven-game unbeaten run that has included a win over Chelsea and two draws against Liverpool.",
      "A derby is always the sort of game where anything can happen. Which set of players is more up for it can often end up being the difference. But, Leeds didn't let the passion get the better of them. It was a calculated performance with intensity and cool heads.",
      "They restricted their visitors from creating much of note from open play, and aside from the goals, the best chances fell at their feet.",
      "For a team that seemed destined for relegation two months ago to be frustrated by not beating a team challenging for the top four, even if United's form has been topsy turvy at best, shows how far Leeds have come.Callum Bishop",
      "\"It speaks about our mentality, our identity.\"",
      "Fulham's sixth point from a losing position to deservedly draw 2-2 with Liverpool is nothing remarkable compared to their Premier League colleagues, but the resilience Marco Silva talks about runs deeper.",
      "Since losing Alex Iwobi, Samuel Chukwueze and Calvin Bassey to AFCON - a trio who have racked up a higher proportion of goal contributions than any other club's African absentees - Fulham are unbeaten and have picked up eight points from four games.",
      "Not long ago, Marco Silva's side were just four points above the drop but even then he spoke of record points tallies.",
      "Now the Cottagers are six points off the top four with their international players to return but also a number of injuries - including Ryan Sessegnon and Rodrigo Muniz, who would both certainly compete to be first-choice selections.",
      "Silva's sides have always been about character but there has been spark at Fulham in recent years and though that has slightly dimmed this season there were moments against Liverpool.",
      "The one frustration for Silva and Fulham fans remains the feeling that with a little added investment, his squad could be capable of even more.",
      "Silva himself chooses to run with a small squad but when injuries strike and back-up choices are limited, it leaves them and their manager facing an uphill struggle.",
      "It's one they are managing remarkably well so far. And with Chelsea visiting Craven Cottage amid the transition of a regime change on Wednesday, Fulham will have no doubts they can take full advantage.Ron Walker",
      "Brentford have this very strange phenomenon - the more you take away from them, the stronger they get.",
      "Selling Bryan Mbeumo and Yoane Wissa for a combined £125m was meant to derail them, many thought it would limit them to relegation candidates.",
      "But not only does Thiago now have twice as many Premier League goals (14), than Mbeumo and Wissa combined, but Andrews is threatening to go one better than Thomas Frank and qualify this team for Europe.",
      "Still, Brentford are not at full strength. Dango Ouattara is away at the Africa Cup of Nations, Jordan Henderson cannot play every game and the likes of Fabio Carvalho and Antoni Milambo are out for the season - but still Andrews finds a way.",
      "Jensen was placed in an unorthodox right-wing role at Everton and it brought the best out of Mikkel Damsgaard, benched for the last four games but the second-best player on the park. Damsgaard being able to play quick passes released more space for Brentford - and Thiago benefitted.",
      "It earned Brentford just their third away win of the season - and if they manage to get an away run to partner their Gtech threat, then maybe they - not Sunderland, who they face on Wednesday - will be the surprise package of the season.",
      "And perhaps, having never been a head coach before last summer, let alone a Premier League one, Andrews could be a real contender for manager of the season.Sam Blitz",
      "\"The game meant a lot,\" said David Moyes, searching for the consistency that would allow Everton fans to dream of a European push this season. But it was one bridge too far for Everton.",
      "The Toffees currently look like a stretched team lacking in resources. Iliman Ndiaye and Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall are big misses and as for their back-ups Tyler Dibling and Dwight McNeil, their half-time withdrawals were indications they cannot be relied on just yet.",
      "Jake O'Brien summed it up at the end of the game, describing the performance as \"tired\". There were slack passes like James Tarkowski's mistake for the opener, while Igor Thiago could have had three more goals than the treble he got.",
      "Everton ultimately need bodies in the transfer market if they want to push for the top half. With mistakes all round the pitch, they need more than the returning Dewsbury-Hall, Ndiaye and Idrissa Gueye if they want to be ambitious.Sam Blitz",
      "New year, same old soundtrack at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium as the final whistle in Spurs' 1-1 draw against Sunderland was once again greeted by boos.",
      "Last year saw Spurs suffer 11 league home defeats - a club record in a calendar year - and although this was not a loss, the home fans left dissatisfied again.",
      "A bright first half had Spurs supporters smiling, with a shot-laden display that saw a surprise goal scorer in Ben Davies.",
      "His first Spurs goal in three years on his first Premier League start of the season brought about fun-filled chants, making the mood feel different at half-time in north London.",
      "But it proved a false dawn, as Sunderland came out a different side in the second half to deservedly peg Spurs back and maintain the ill-feeling in N17.",
      "Spurs boss Thomas Frank once again heard jeers at the final whistle as he continues his battle against an unhappy fanbase.",
      "And when it rains, it pours, as Mohammed Kudus suffered a first-half injury just two days after Brennan Johnson's £35m Crystal Palace exit, leaving Spurs short in attacking options.",
      "The January transfer window's significance has become even more important now for Frank if he is to come through this Spurs storm.Declan Olley",
      "Newcastle were the better side against Crystal Palace but the game could have easily gone against them.",
      "After seeing two goals ruled out for offside in the first half, nerves and tension were high amongst the crowd. Then their captain, Bruno Guimaraes, stepped up.",
      "\"Bruno is a very special player, a special person and a special character. Today he played a captain's role,\" said Howe after the game.",
      "\"That game was always going to be decided by key moments and he's come up with a big one for us, he's done it countless times.\"",
      "The midfielder didn't win the game singlehandedly for the Magpies but he inspired the victory.",
      "He has now moved level with Nick Woltemade as their joint-top goalscorer in the Premier League and is now on course to have his best season in a Newcastle shirt.",
      "A constant and reliable option for his team, whose importance stretches far wider than just game-winning goals, such as on Sunday.",
      "There are few midfielders as well-rounded as he is. One of the best in the league.Patrick Rowe",
      "Oliver Glasner seemed defeated in his post-match press conference.",
      "With a sigh in almost every breath, he admitted he had \"failed\" the team currently, as he struggles to find a solution to their set-piece woes.",
      "Palace were worthy of at least a draw in this game but walked away empty-handed after becoming undone by two set pieces from Newcastle.",
      "Glasner pointed out that this is now a common theme plaguing his side, stating that five of their last six defeats are solely down to set pieces.",
      "He's right. Fifty-two per cent of the goals they have conceded in the Premier League have been from set pieces, the highest proportion of any team in the top-flight.",
      "Their winless streak across all competitions now sits at seven games and unless they solve the growing issue in the squad, that will continue to worsen week by week as teams begin to target their clear weakness.",

      "Man Utd boss Ruben Amorim has said he is a manager and not a head coach after being questioned on his ability to manage the club; Amorim hinted at frustrations regarding the club's transfer plans prior to the 1-1 draw with Leeds United",
      "Monday 5 January 2026 07:27, UK",
      "Ruben Amorim has sensationally claimed that he joined Manchester United to be their manager, not their head coach, and suggested that he will leave the club at the end of his contract.",
      "Asked whether he still feels he has the backing of the club's board during his press conference following Sunday's 1-1 draw at Leeds, Amorim was keen to clarify his role at the club having recently hinted at friction behind the scenes over transfers and tactics.",
      "The former Sporting boss was unveiled as head coach when he was appointed at Old Trafford in November 2024 on a two-and-a-half-year contract which is due to expire in June 2027, but, in an apparent message to the hierarchy, he has said he sees himself as manager.",
      "\"I notice that you receive selective information about everything,\" he said in an explosive finish to his press conference at Elland Road.",
      "\"I came here to be the manager of Manchester United, not to be the coach of Manchester United. That is clear.",
      "\"I know that my name is not [Thomas] Tuchel, it's not [Antonio] Conte, it's not [Jose] Mourinho, but I'm the manager of Manchester United and it's going to be like this for 18 months or when the board decides to change.",
      "\"That was my point. I want to finish with that. I'm not going to quit. I will do my job until another guy is coming here to replace me.\"",
      "Asked whether he felt assurances from the club had not been fulfilled, Amorim added: \"I just want to say I'm going to be the manager of this team, not just the coach. I was really clear on that.",
      "\"That is going to finish in 18 months and then everyone is going to move on. That was the deal. That is my job, not to be a coach.",
      "\"If people cannot handle the Gary Nevilles and the criticisms of everything, we need to change the club.",
      "\"I just want to say that I came here to be the manager of Manchester United, not to be the coach.",
      "\"Every department - the scouting department, the sport director - needs to do their job. I will do mine for 18 months, and then we move on.\"",
      "Amorim's comments follow a suggestion on Christmas Eve that he has not received the backing he anticipated in the transfer market to play with his preferred tactical system.",
      "\"I have the feeling if we have to play a perfect 3-4-3, we need to spend a lot of money and we need time,\" he said. \"I'm starting to understand that is not going to happen. So, maybe I have to adapt.\"",
      "Amorim subsequently fielded a back four for the first time in Manchester United's win over Newcastle on Boxing Day, but reverted to a back three against Wolves.",
      "He then gave an uncharacteristically downbeat press conference before the Leeds game on Friday which featured more cryptic comments.",
      "\"There was a clear shift in Amorim's mood at his Friday press conference and it didn't improve this afternoon. He seemed quite similar and made it clear repeatedly that he is the Manchester United manager, and that that is what he came to do.",
      "\"He referenced Conte, Tuchel and Mourinho. That can be interpreted as him saying he doesn't have the full autonomy of big-name managers, or it can be interpreted as him saying his decisions are being questioned by those higher up at the club.",
      "\"One thing that cannot be argued, though, is that there has been a clear shift in Amorim's mood in the last week or so. We felt that on Friday at his news conference ahead of this game, and it hasn't improved whatsoever after the 1-1 draw.\"",
