      "Former Manchester United academy starlet Martin Svidersky is still yet to make his senior debut for Almeria. Ever since his move to the La Liga side, the Slovakian youngster has been confined to reserve team duties.",
      "In the summer of 2022, the then-19 year old turned down a new contract with the Red Devils and exited Old Trafford for a fresh start with the Spanish club. Despite battling through numerous injuries while in the academy, United were keen to keep him and offered him an extension.",
      "At that time, the Red Devils had just gone through a dismal season, which resulted in Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's dismissal and Ralf Rangnick taking temporary charge. Svidersky, who joined United at the tender age of 15 in 2018, could have had the chance to showcase his talents to Erik ten Hag.",
      "Instead, he opted for a switch to Spain with Almeria, but the move hasn't gone as planned for the midfielder. His failure to break into the first team is a huge fall from grace after he was tipped for big things when he arrived on the red side of Manchester.",
      "Upon signing for Almeria, he expressed his optimism to RTVS at the time, saying: \"I have spent the last days in Spain, where my steps will continue. They will follow in the first Spanish league, La Liga. I have high expectations, it will be a new experience, a new country.\"",
      "However, his journey with Almeria got off to a rocky start when he was sent off on his debut for the reserves, despite their 3-0 victory over El Palo FC. His dismissal came after he had waited four months to get onto the pitch for the B team.",
      "After an 18-month stint, he was loaned out to Real Murcia, who ultimately decided not to make the move permanent. Svidersky did see more action with Almeria's reserves last season, clocking up 24 appearances.",
      "However, he might now be regretting his choice to leave Old Trafford. In October 2022, he explained his decision to turn down United's contract offer, believing that he would grow more as a player and individual in Spain.",
      "Speaking to Flashscore, he said: \"I experienced a lot of nice moments in Manchester, but also difficult moments. They definitely strengthened me and taught me a lot. I tried to use every second.",
      "\"I think I made the most of my time. It's true that I didn't manage to fulfil the dream I came for, I was very close, but I chose a different path.",
      "\"I prioritised personal development over 'fame'. I met great people who I have stayed in touch with. Thank you also for my second parents from Manchester who have already come to visit me in Spain.\"",
      "The Slovakian's exit also meant missing out on what could have been an impressive season at United under Ten Hag, who led the team to a third-place finish and a League Cup victory.",
      "That season turned out to be Ten Hag's best with United, as they ended up eighth the next year before clinching the FA Cup. The former Ajax boss was dismissed at the end of October 2024 following a loss to West Ham United which left the team languishing in 14th place.",

      "Manchester United chief executive Omar Berrada was hailed as the man who would bring back the glory years to Old Trafford when Sir Jim Ratcliffe lured him away from Manchester City last year.",
      "But the 47-year-old has discovered that if you don’t enter the transfer market in a position of strength then football becomes a cruel business.",
      "Berrada has been working closely with director of football Jason Wilcox to recruit the kind of talent that manager Ruben Amorim is demanding after a nightmare first six months at the club ended with United finishing in their lowest league position for 50 years.",
      "Amorim will be delighted that by the time he touches down in Chicago at the start of United’s pre-season tour of the United States, he will have Bryan Mbeumo to strengthen an attack that will also include the hugely talented Matheus Cunha.",
      "But Berrada has had to sanction a £70million outlay to secure Mbeumo - the price he was quoted two months ago when United had a £55million opening bid rejected immediately by Brentford for the Cameroon star.",
      "Cunha was secured for the £62.5million buy-out clause stipulated in his contract at Wolves. And United must pay the fee in three instalments over the next two years after the Molineux club dismissed a notion that the deal could be settled over an extended five-year period.",
      "This isn’t the way that Berrada did business at the Etihad.",
      "When he worked alongside City sporting director Txiki Begiristain, the pair would often walk away from deals if the figures didn't add up. City refused to break their budget when Southampton were asking for a world-record £75million for Virgil van Dijk.",
      "While their stance backfired on that occasion, they did the same when it came to negotiations over players like Paul Pogba, Harry Maguire, Fred and Jorginho. The first three of those names ended up at Old Trafford.",
      "United's lack of joined-up thinking continued when Berrada arrived last summer. More than £200million was lavished on Levy Yoro, Manuel Ugarte, Matthijs De Ligt, Joshua Zirkzee and Noussair Mazraoui - and in November the decision was taken to sack manager Erik ten Hag.",
      "Amorim was recruited from Sporting Lisbon on Berrada's insistence - despite the Portuguese's three-at-the-back philosophy being an awkward fit for the squad he inherited.",
      "With United more than £1billion in debt and facing issues complying with Profit and Sustainability Regulations, the club are unable to spend their way out of the mess that has been created by more than a decade of gross mismanagement.",
      "When Amorim’s team lost to Spurs in the Europa League Final in May and missed out on Champions League qualification, the need to sell unwanted players to raise money became even more acute.",
      "Cashing in on Marcus Rashford, Alejandro Garnacho, Jadon Sancho, Antony and Tyrell Malacia would have potentially raised hundreds of millions of pounds in normal circumstances.",
      "But Amorim’s decision to group them in a so called bomb-squad, refusing to allow them to train with the players he wants to take into the new season and instructing them to report for fitness sessions late in the afternoon when the chosen ones have left the building at Carrington means interested clubs are playing a waiting game in the knowledge that United are being held to ransom by the policy.",
      "Berrada must find a way of breaking the deadlock - and quickly."

      "Ruben Amorim gave an unofficial debut to £62.5million signing Matheus Cunha, who was one of the only positive takeaways from the match. Otherwise it followed a familiar theme for the club, who finished a lowly 15th last season and are expected to improve in 2025/26.",
      "Hojlund managed 10 goals in 52 appearances for United last season, only four of which came in the league, and he often cut a frustrated figure up front. That continued on Saturday in the Swedish capital – and the Danish striker wasn’t shy in letting his team-mates know.",
      "Hojlund was looking for Dalot to pass the ball in behind the Leeds defence, but it came later than he wanted it, meaning he was likely offside. \"F*** sake,\" he yelled in Dalot’s direction. The Portuguese full-back wasn’t interested in hearing his moans and simply ignored him and jogged on.",
      "The lack of a link-up between the two United players was evident later in the game too. Dalot did find Hojlund with a cross, only for his header to be deflected, while the young striker was shouting at Dalot again later on after he opted to pass to Patrick Dorgu instead of him.",
      "This is a make or break pre-season for Amorim, but he clearly isn’t concerned about the atmosphere around the squad, who are missing Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho, Antony, Tyrell Malacia and Alejandro Garnacho, who have been banished.",

We have a lot to do but it was a first test against a Premier League team with two different teams, a good test.",

Amorim used the first game of pre-season to give no fewer than 24 players a run-out in the Stockholm sunshine after ordering Marcus Rashford and the rest of his misfits to stay behind at Old Trafford.",
      "There were debuts for £62.5million Matheus Cunha and £7million Diego Leon in the Strawberry Arena. Bryan Mbeumo will join the squad in the United States this week after the Reds agreed to meet Brentford’s £70million valuation of the Cameroon international almost two months after the London club made it clear their asking price was non-negotiable.",
      "Amorim will now be hoping that Sir Jim Ratcliffe will free up some cash to sign the goal-scoring striker he craves after Barcelona opened talks about taking Rashford to Spain for the season with a £50million option to buy making the deal a no-brainer for United.",
      "If they can also raise some cash by flogging Jadon Sancho, Antony, Alejandro Garnacho and Tyrell Malacia then perhaps there will be even more wriggle room for new recruits. United certainly need the rebuild to continue at pace.",
      "Amorim was only spared a relegation battle last season by the dire form of the three promoted clubs who eventually went down. There was certainly no obvious gap in quality between the two different teams he sent out in each half to face Daniel Farke’s Football League champions.",
      "A pedestrian first period ended with Casemiro’s cross flicking off Leeds skipper Ethan Ampadu and glancing the crossbar. But after the kick-off had to be delayed by 10 minutes due to crowd congestion, thrills and spills were at a premium for the 43,345 Scandinavian fans who fancied taking in one of those rivalries that make the Premier League so compelling.",
      "There were Leeds debuts for Jaka Bijol and Lukas Nmecha, with fellow new-boys Sean Longstaff, Gabriel Gudmundsson and Sebastian Bornauw following suit in the second half after starting on the bench.",
      "Leeds will strengthen further this week when German midfielder Anton Stach arrives from Hoffenheim for £17million. Farke also rang the changes after the break, with Hollywood funnyman Will Ferrell, a minority investor at Elland Road, travelling to Sweden to offer his support from the posh seats.",
      "Ferrell might have had reason to smile in the second half as Leeds carved out decent chances for Jayden Bogle and substitute Largie Ramazani. Both times, keeper Tom Heaton came to United’s rescue with saves that illustrated why he has signed a one-year contract extension at the grand old age of 39.",
      "Amorim made 11 changes at half-time and was forced into another 18 minutes from time when Harry Maguire limped off with a knock. United should have won the contest two minutes from time, but Robbie Mainoo headed against the crossbar and Ayden Heaven fired his follow-up straight at Leeds keeper Illan Meslier from point-blank range.",

      "Manchester United are close to wrapping up negotiations with Juventus over the sale of Jadon Sancho. United are desperate to sell Sancho, who has been kicked out of first-team training by Ruben Amorim, and are about to get their wish.",
      "Amorim has banned Sancho, Marcus Rashford, Alejandro Garnacho, Antony and Tyrrell Malacia from attending the training ground at the same time as the first team. They are currently forced to arrive after 5pm, when everyone else has already gone home, in order to keep fit.",
      "The ‘bomb squad’ approach has proven contentious at United – but it is about to bear fruit with Sancho, with a transfer to Juventus a matter of days away. The winger had appeared set to join Chelsea at the end of the season after spending the campaign on loan with the Blues.",
      "However, Chelsea turned down the opportunity to sign him permanently, deciding they would rather stump up a £5million fee than pay £25m for his services. Sancho then agreed personal terms with Fenerbahce over a transfer, only for that move to collapse.",
      "Thankfully for United, Juve have stepped into the breach and Italian outlet Sportmediaset report that there is now a ‘full agreement’ with Sancho over a four-year contract worth €6m (£5.2m) per year. The Italian giants are close to agreeing terms with United too.",
      "Juve initially offered £15m (€17m), but are now ready to meet United’s asking price of €25m (£21.6m) – a figure which includes easily achievable add-ons and severance pay for Sancho, who is halving his salary to move to Turin.",
      "Sancho is currently paid around £300,000 per week by United, where he is under contract until June 2026. Fenerbahce had been willing to pay him €10m (£8.5m) per year, but that move to Jose Mourinho’s side fell apart.",
      "Juve are reportedly confident they can complete the deal before Thursday after Sancho’s agent spent time in Turin this week to agree terms. The transfer will bring to an end the 25-year-old’s miserable spell at United, who paid £73m to sign him from Borussia Dortmund in 2021.",
      "The winger has just 12 goals and six assists in 83 games for United, but still has a good reputation elsewhere. He registered five goals and 10 assists in 42 appearances across all competitions for Chelsea last season, helping them win the Conference League, and was impressive at Dortmund before that.",
      "It could be a crucial week for United, who are also close to finalising a move for Rashford to Barcelona. The Catalan giants are taking Rashford on loan for the 2025/26 season and will pay his entire £325,000-a-week wages and retain an option to sign him permanently."

      "Manchester United kicked off their pre-season campaign with a 0-0 draw against Leeds in Stockholm with one eye on next week's tour of the United States.",
      "Ruben Amorim handed a debut to the club's marquee summer signing, Matheus Cunha, in a strong first half team and the Brazilian attacker was by far the brightest spark in a relatively dour opening 45 minutes, where he linked neatly with United's other new boy, Diego Leon, on the left-hand side.",
      "Neither team could find a breakthrough and both rang the changes at half-time with United fielding a completely new XI for the second period.",
      "It was Leeds who came closest to the opener after the break with Tom Heaton making two good saves to keep the Premier League new boys at bay with Amine Ramazani spurning a golden chance to score.",
      "United and Leeds traded blows in the second half but, as the game petered out, honours stayed even amid a flurry of late substitutes from both sides.",
      "Cunha is one of the club's two summer signings to date and he was by far the brightest spark in a dire first half showing from both teams.",
      "The former Wolves man was dynamic and was one of the few players threatening to make things happen in the final third. He started proceedings as the left-sided No 10 in Amorim's preferred system and immediately looks right at home.",
      "Amad was one of the few shining lights in a difficult campaign for Manchester United and he looked bright again in Stockholm.",
      "But where does he fit best in United's current shape? He started here as the right wing-back but swapped positions with Toby Collyer to take up the right-sided No 10 spot. The uber-talented star has the attributes to thrive further up the pitch but it will be intriguing to see where he plays with Bryan Mbeumo incoming.",
      "Amorim's wing-backs are as good as wingers at time given how high they are up the pitch. Amad has caught the eye in an attacking role in the past, though. Whatever the manager's decision, one thing is for sure: Amad should surely be on of the first names on Amorim's teamsheet this coming season.",
      "United's game at the Strawberry Arena gave fans an early glimpse of their new wing-back, just 18. And Leon showed why he is now set to stay and compete for a place in Amorim's team instead of Harry Amass, who is poised to head out on loan.",
      "He looked comfortable high up and pitch and crafted one chance for Chido Obi in a lacklustre first half with a neat no-look pass. Leon has obviously been signed with the future in mind, but as far as first impressions go, this was positive.",
      "Yes, this point isn't exactly hot off the press, but Manchester United really need to kick into action in the transfer market.",
      "Their first half performance was reminiscent of plenty of United's games last season bar a brief flurry of penalty box action late in the half. If Amorim is to succeed, then he needs to be backed with signings.",
      "Cunha and Leon looked bright and Mbeumo was one of the Premier League's top attackers last season. He and Cunha in particular will help United no end, but they need much more if they are to have a successful season. Yes, funds are tight so that means player sales are needed. But United need to get moving on that front if they are to give Amorim the tools he requires to rebuild this team properly. Over to you, then, Ineos.",
      "Listen, it's the first game of pre-season: and it's certainly not all doom and gloom for Manchester United.",
      "The likes of Amad, Leon, Ayden Heaven, Leny Yoro, Kobbie Mainoo and Bendito Mantito to name just a few are evidence that the future is bright for United, even if things aren't all rosy at the moment. United just need the right signings to help balance things out and push them back among the Premier League's elite."

This is the job from Deco, is clear, and I will support him.”",

      "Man United have made numerous pre-season trips to Sweden over the years, while both clubs have sizeable fan bases in Scandinavia. The club met in the region just two years ago, with Man United winning 2-0 in Oslo. Here’s the lowdown on the match, including kick-off time and how to watch…",
      "The friendly will be played at the 50,000-capacity Strawberry Arena, the country's national stadium, where the Red Devils defeated Ajax in the 2017 Europa League final. It will kick-off at the unusual time of 2pm.",
      "Alternatively, the channel can be purchased directly from the club at £7.99 per month or £29.99 per year, allowing fans to stream the game on their mobile devices. Build-up will begin an hour before kick-off.",
      "Leeds fans can watch the game via their club's streaming service, LUTV, with match passes costing £4.99.",
      "As the Red Devils continue their pursuit of Bryan Mbeumo, having made an improved £70million bid for the Brentford forward, a number of other players will make their debut against Leeds, including £62.5m signing from the Wolves, Matheus Cunha.",
      "Paraguayan youngster Diego Leon, 18, who has linked up with his new team-mates after his transfer was agreed back in January, could also be involved. Goalkeeper Andre Onana will miss the match with a hamstring issue, while Lisandro Martinez is continuing his recovery from a serious knee injury.",
      "Leeds' new signings Jaka Bijol, Gabriel Gudmundsson, Sebastiaan Bornauw and Lukas Nmecha could also be involved in the match.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more."

      "Former Manchester United boss Erik ten Hag suffered a disastrous start to life at Bayer Leverkusen - after they were humiliated by Flamengo's Under-20 team.",
      "In his first game back in management since being sacked by United last year, Ten Hag - who took over from Xabi Alonso at Leverkusen last month - saw his side humbled and embarrassed in Brazil, beaten 5-1. It was his first game in the dugout since being dismissed by United last October.",
      "He witnessed his new squad being soundly defeated by the Brazilian team. German media outlet Bild labelled the match 'a debacle'.",
      "Leverkusen may still be adjusting to life without Florian Wirtz, Jeremie Frimpong and Jonathan Tah, all of whom left the Bundesliga side at the end of the season and had been key players during their title winning triumph of 2023-24, and it was only a friendly. But my word.",
      "Leverkusen were able to field Mark Flekken, Jonas Hofmann, Victor Boniface and ex-United defender Timothy Fosu-Mensah in the starting XI for the friendly in Rio de Janeiro. However, the Bundesliga team found themselves 2-0 down within the first ten minutes of the match, before Flamengo were 4-0 up at half-time.",
      "Flekken and Boniface were substituted off with just 36 minutes on the clock, with Niklas Lomb and Alejo Sarco their replacements. A sign perhaps that, already, all is not well.",
      "Montrell Culbreath netted a consolation goal for Leverkusen in the dying minutes of their pre-season friendly.",
      "Ten Hag's next assignment with Leverkusen is a warm-up match against German outfit Bochum next Saturday.",
      "\"The result looks bad, but I don't really care about results in preseason,\" he remarked. \"We should never lose, even by a large margin, but it was important to me not to lose any players.",
      "\"It would have been better to play the game later.\"",

      "Just like last year, Manchester United's pre-season schedile began without them scoring. Unlike that unwatchable friendly against Rosenborg, they avoided defeat to Leeds United in Stockholm.",
      "Ruben Amorim fielded two different XIs in each half as the United players build up match fitness ahead of next Saturday's first tour test against West Ham United in New Jersey.",
      "Overall, 24 players were used as Tyler Fredricson and Jack Fletcher emerged for minutes in the second half. United fly to Chicago, their base while they are in the United States, on Tuesday and should have Bryan Mbeumo on board their flight.",
      "Here are five talking points from their first friendly in Sweden:",
      "Each player will be at different stages of their fitness and the rotational XI indicated that. The second XI for the second half was arguably stronger.",
      "It was still mystifying that Amorim opted for Toby Collyer as one of the two playmakers when it is the one area of the squad where United have a surfeit of options.",
      "Collyer said on tour last season he needed to improve on his ball-work. Shifting from a deep role to such an advanced position for a central midfielder by trade is unlikely to do him any favours. Collyer looked as lost as a playmaker as he did at left back against Barnsley last year.",
      "Midfield is one of United's weakest areas. The brains trust possibly believe they can cope with a quintet of Collyer, Bruno Fernandes, Manuel Ugarte, Casemiro and Kobbie Mainoo in a season devoid of European football. United cannot shift Casemiro, which is partly blocking an upgrade to that department.",
      "Fernandes has excelled from deep in the past and United are banking on him to carry the midfield. Ugarte was dropped for the Europa League final, Mainoo lost his first-team status several months ago, Casemiro could be redundant with no UEFA competition to participate in and Collyer has started three games against teams from League One, Scotland and Romania.",
      "Mainoo lined up in midfield in the second half and Amorim has to make his mind up on where he will primarily play next season.",
      "Shortly before the hour, Diogo Dalot charged into the Leeds third and played the ball into the channel for Rasmus Hojlund. Hojlund may have strayed offside and nothing came of his backheel.",
      "Before Hojlund got back to his feet, he was ready to let rip at Dalot. \"F**k's sake,\" he shouted, clearly irked that Dalot had not passed the ball sooner.",
      "It is not the first time Hojlund has vented at Dalot's end product. The most infamous flashpoint was in San Sebastian in March. Dalot was apologetic that night. On this occasion, he kept on running and blanked out the noise from Hojlund.",
      "Amad is the one winger who has survived United's cull as he has the defensive discipline to complement his attacking instincts. He has never been a problem for United, either, unlike Marcus Rashford, Alejandro Garnacho, Jadon Sancho and Antony.",
      "Amorim said he prefers to use the Ivory Coast winger closer to goal but he played Amad on the flank in Sweden. Bryan Mbeumo is waiting in the wings and time will tell if he is used on the wing.",
      "Matheus Cunha was fouled a couple of times on his first United start and one or two other challenges arguably warranted a stoppage. Cunha got plenty of attention at Wolves and markers will doubtless be tighter and nastier now he is United's No.10.",
      "Fernandes was quick to impose himself on his United debut in February 2020 and Cunha is not a shrinking violet. He was well within his rights to rebuke Chido Obi for shooting while off balance when Cunha was well poised to at least hit the target as the ball rolled towards him. Obi offered an apologetic low-five.",
      "Even from 45 minutes that may have sent plenty of viewers to sleep, there were glimpses that Cunha is United material.",
      "Sean Longstaff and Daniel James lined up together for United. Leeds United. If Ole Gunnar Solskjaer had it his way, it would have been for Manchester United six years ago.",
      "United's pursuit of Longstaff ended in 2019 when Newcastle quoted them £50million. James did join the club and he has regressed to his true level since that purple patch at the beginning of his Old Trafford career, signing for relegation fodder, suffering relegation and a couple of seasons in the Championship."

      "Amad is close friends with Garnacho, who is also expected to leave this summer, and he was asked whether it would a shame to see the winger depart, considering their relationship.",
      "\"I think this is not really my problem,\" said Amad in a thoughtful tone. \"The only thing I’m thinking right now is how we will learn together as a team and yeah, that’s the only thing I’m trying to think about right now.\"",
      "Amad has regularly shared photos with Garnacho and Kobbie Mainoo from within the dressing room at Old Trafford. The trio are understood to be particularly close.",
      "Garnacho attracted interest from Napoli and Chelsea in the January transfer window, and the outright sale of the 21-year-old would be hugely beneficial to United to comply with Profit and Sustainability Rules (PSR)."

      "His place in the XI for United's pre-season opener in the Swedish capital marked his first start of any kind since January 30.",
      "United beat FCSB 2-0 in their final Europa League league phase match that evening and Collyer had been withdrawn by the time goals from Diogo Dalot and Kobbie Mainoo steered the Reds safely through to the last-16.",
      "He was deployed alongside Bruno Fernandes in midfield in Bucharest, with Christian Eriksen and Mainoo preferred in the two No.10 positions.",
      "When the teamsheet dropped at the Strawberry Arena, it appeared as though Collyer was going to operate next to Casemiro in the centre of midfield, with Fernandes supporting new signing Matheus Cunha and Chido Obi in attack.",
      "However, it was Collyer who was deployed further forward. He occupied the right-sided No.10 spot and Fernandes joined Casemiro in the engine room.",
      "Pre-season is all about experimenting ahead of the competitive action so Ruben Amorim is entitled to test the water in matches where the outcome means very little.",
      "However, the United head coach's decision to deploy Collyer further forward was perhaps his way of trying to help Fernandes. Following the addition of Cunha, the feeling throughout the summer has been that the United captain will start the 2025/26 campaign in midfield.",
      "Fernandes regularly dropped deep in the second half of last season and was arguably more effective. He enjoyed a real purple patch in March when he was stationed as one of the two No.8s.",
      "With Bryan Mbeumo closing in on a move to Old Trafford, he is set to battle it out with Amad to land the right-sided No.10 spot. It is unlikely Amorim considers that position as Collyer's long-term habitat.",
      "Widely considered as a midfielder that tends to sit deep and try and marshal proceedings, it would be a drastic shift if he was to suddenly be transformed into a playmaker.",
      "With four more friendlies still to come, Amorim has plenty of time to experiment. However, the closer United get to the end of their pre-season schedule, the more likely it is the former Sporting Lisbon boss will field an XI that resembles something close to the one he has in mind for the season opener against Arsenal.",
      "United's starting XI in Stockholm had a rotational feel to it. An as interesting as Amorim's decision to start Collyer in such an advanced role was, it is likely he did it to try and get another look at Fernandes as a No.8.",
      "Having previously admitting he could see himself dropping deeper as his career progresses, Fernandes might be about to make a permanent position change at Old Trafford.",
      "Manchester United have launched their new away kit for the 2025/26 season, inspired by the club's early-1990s Adidas snowflake kit."

      "Hugill was also on target in United's final friendly before the tour last year against Rangers at Murrayfield. After an unfulfilling loan at League One side Wigan Athletic was cut short, he ended the season on the Carlisle bench as they were relegated to the National League. Hugill is now at League Two Barnet and his last 12 months could make for a power point presentation to keep every United youngster grounded.",
      "United, true to form, did not score against Leeds. No new striker and no goal. No surprise. That is how pre-season ended last year against Liverpool, with a 3-0 loss. A month later, Liverpool inflicted the same scoreline on United again and that one did matter.",
      "Tom Heaton, on for the second half, was United's best player, saving well from Largie Ramazani and Jayden Bogle. Even at the age of 39, Heaton is a more secure option in goal than the jittery Altay Bayindir in Andre Onana's absence.",
      "Unlike Hugill, Chido Obi missed the target when he had the temerity to shoot whilst off balance with Matheus Cunha running onto the ball. Cunha immediately rebuked Obi, who sheepishly offered a low five.",
      "Bruno Fernandes was quick to impose himself on his United debut, practically ordering players about when they had been his teammates for barely 48 hours. Cunha has a similar on-pitch personality.",
      "Last season's flashpoints against Ipswich Town and Bournemouth are evidence that Cunha is no shrinking violet. He has an edge that opponents will attempt to exploit but teammates can also expect to cop grief if they err.",
      "Cunha's exchange with Obi was not a case of bad body language. It was a senior player informing a junior player of the error of his ways. Obi can get a pass in a friendly but woe betide him if he repeats that in a meaningful match.",
      "There were a couple of fouls on Cunha, which he should take as a compliment. The odd physical duel injected a fragment of competitiveness into a mundane game.",

      "Hojlund's concern was that he may have strayed offside before he ran onto the through ball. On this evidence, the Dane's body language has not improved from last season.",
      "Dalot was apologetic when he failed to pass to Hojlund in San Sebastian in March but on this occasion ran on and blanked out the rollocking. With it so well-documented that United want a new striker, Hojlund cannot command much faith or confidence from teammates when they are warming up to service a new No.9.",
      "Twenty-two minutes later, Dalot crossed satisfactorily for Hojlund, who gave a thumbs up. His blocked header resulted in a goal kick. In added time, Hojlund was on Dalot's case again when he passed to Patrick Dorgu rather than him.",
      "There was a goalmouth scramble in the dying embers when Kobbie Mainoo hit the bar from three yards out and Ayden Heaven's prod on the follow-up was blocked. Hojliund should have been where Mainoo was, yet was the one heading the ball back across goal.",
      "Ruben Amorim operated identically to Erik ten Hag with the opening pre-season friendlies, fielding two entirely different XIs in each half. This one was reminiscent of the unwatchable post-season tour match in Kuala Lumpur that United lost. They were booed off that night, so avoided that at least.",
      "United showed more intent with their second XI in the second half. Dorgu was more attack-minded and drew a save while Mason Mount offered some incision.",

      "United and Brentford have been locked in negotiations for a deal for Mbeumo for several weeks and finally reached a breakthrough on Friday. The offer from United was the third bid presented to the Bees, which has now been accepted as Mbeumo looks set to secure a move to Old Trafford.",
      "Tottenham also expressed an interest in signing Mbeumo before United beat the North London outfit in the race for the winger's signature earlier in the summer.",
      "Frank was Mbeumo's manager during his time as Brentford boss before he took on the role as Tottenham manager in the summer, replacing Ange Postecoglou in the process.",
      "It was Frank who signed Mbeumo from Troyes back in 2019, and the Spurs boss has now given his reaction to the 25-year-old's move to United.",
      "\"Bryan [Mbeumo], of course, is a fantastic player. I have been with him for five years,\" Frank told reporters on Friday.",
      "\"I think he deserves the move, no matter where he goes. And as a player, I wish him all the best when you've been with a player for so long.\"",
      "United will be hoping to wrap up a deal for Mbeumo in the near future and make the forward their second signing of the summer transfer window. United have already completed the signing of Matheus Cunha from Wolves in a £62.5million deal, while the club also brought in Diego Leon after a deal was agreed with Cerro Porteno earlier in the year."

      "One of the best pieces of news Manchester United fans will have come across this transfer window was a Championship club rejecting a bid from a Premier League club.",
      "Brentford's offer for Omari Hutchinson was another step in the right direction for United in their negotiations for Bryan Mbeumo. Despite the wait, that deal has never appeared in jeopardy.",
      "United start their season against Arsenal in four weeks and the transfer window is open for six more weeks. The only 'deadline' was United's departure for Chicago on Tuesday.",
      "They now expect Brentford to accept their third and probably final offer of £65million rising to £70m. Brentford have held out for a higher fee for Mbeumo than the £62.5m Matheus Cunha, which is somewhat logical. Cunha got 15 Premier League goals last season and Mbeumo got 20. Mbeumo is slightly younger than Cunha and played in the Premier League for twice as long.",
      "Manchester United have launched their new away kit for the 2025/26 season, inspired by the club's early-1990s Adidas snowflake kit.",
      "The change of manager at Brentford was always bound to cause a hold-up. Brentford also needed time to line up their duck to replace Mbeumo. Hutchinson is a left-footed right winger with a release clause. Ipswich Town rejected Brentford's package as it was not an up-front payment.",
      "And so, when push comes to shove, United seem likely to get Mbeumo in time for him to be in the squad against West Ham United in New Jersey next Saturday. Mbeumo will have missed out on a full week's worth of pre-season training. Hardly an issue for a player who has spent four successive seasons in the Premier League.",
      "There has been a shift from United. A target they initially valued at £50m-odd could end up costing them £70m. Sources say Brentford refused to budge on an overall £70m fee and United eventually relented.",
      "After going the entirety of last summer without breaking the £60m barrier for any of the five signings, United are about to do so with both incomings this summer. Club figures stressed as recently as Wednesday that Mbeumo's fee had to be \"sensible\".",
      "His cost will doubtless drive the price up of that elusive new No.9, unless there is a satisfactory option with a release clause. Some form of a compromise feels inevitable there, whether it is a short-term fix or United settling with their existing options. All of the evidence suggests Rasmus Hojlund and Joshua Zirkzee are not good enough.",
      "At least Cunha and Mbeumo have been plying their trade on these shores. There is a modicum of progress in that United have settled on such fees for players with Premier League experience, rather than for a brash Brazilian in the Netherlands or a callow and underwhelming striker in Italy.",
      "It is needs must, too. United recorded a minus goal difference in 2023-24. Last season, it was ten times worse. Cunha and Mbeumo were towards the top of the Premier League goalscoring charts in 2024-25.",
      "Should they contribute 35 league goals between them for United, nobody will mention their fees. Expectations should be reined in, though. Wolves finished 14th and 16th in Cunha's two campaigns at Molineux. Mbeumo has been playing at a stadium with a capacity of 17,250. The Sir Alex Ferguson Stand alone is much bigger than that.",
      "The pair are in for a culture shock though United are confident the players have the wherewithal to cope with the great expectations and the greater scrutiny. Cunha was always destined for another big move and Mbeumo is one of the most affable and attentive characters in the league.",
      "Mbeumo had a more than respectable first season in the Premier League as Brentford finished 13th yet the winger was so self-critical he embarked on an intensive training programme that entailed posture training. Those close to him are adamant that it marked the turning point in his career.",
      "United should not overburden Mbeumo. They cannot entertain the notion of playing him up front when everyone knows they want an out-and-out striker. Cunha, Amad and Bruno Fernandes are the playmakers who can make United play. Mbeumo has to go into the starting XI on the wing.",
      "The team would be a starting striker shy of completion for the forthcoming season. Centre back is United's strongest area in their squad, Manuel Ugarte has to start repaying the club's investment and is set to have Fernandes as his partner. A more established left winger is bound to be a priority next year but Patrick Dorgu is one of United's most recent investments, albeit at a price (£25m) with little risk.",
      "A new goalkeeper could be needed this time next year, too, unless Andre Onana rediscovers the form of his Champions League semi-final and final campaigns with Ajax and Inter Milan. That would be more good news for United."

      "According to transfer expert Fabrizio Romano, Manchester United have hatched a bold plan to secure their next two signings after landing Bryan Mbeumo.",
      "So far this summer, Man Utd have made two signings as they have spent around £65m to land Matheus Cunha and Diego Leon.",
      "In recent weeks, Ruben Amorim’s side has been focused on signing Mbeumo and their prolonged negotiation with Brentford has paid off this week, with an agreement struck on a deal worth an initial £65m plus £6m in add-ons.",
      "United made Mbeumo a top target after he scored 20 Premier League goals in 2024/25, and like Cunha, he would be an upgrade on last season’s No.10 options and has reportedly had his medical on Saturday.",
      "The arrival of Mbeumo would be a significant boost, but they need to remain in the market for more additions after finishing 15th in the Premier League and failing to win a trophy in 2024/25.",
      "READ: Man Utd reach ‘verbal agreement’ for fourth signing after Mbeumo as ‘medical’ date set",
      "The two remaining priorities are to sign a striker and a goalkeeper as United require upgrades on Andre Onana and Rasmus Hojlund.",
      "Romano has confirmed this, but he has revealed that they “don’t want to spend fresh money” on a goalkeeper as they intend to “save the money for a striker”.",
      "Due to this, Romano claims Man Utd hoped to reach an agreement with Aston Villa over a “swap deal” for Emiliano Martinez.",
      "“For Emi Martinez, the idea was to discuss a swap deal with Aston Villa,” Romano said.",
      "“They don’t want to spend fresh money but instead save the money for a striker. At the moment, club-to-club talks haven’t started and Man Utd haven’t approached Villa. It’s not an easy topic.",
      "“Man Utd know that Dibu Martinez is keen on a move to them. But it depends on what they want to do and, financially, what they can do.",
      "“Outgoings are very important for Man Utd after spending money on Matheus Cunha and Mbeumo.”",
      "Man Utd have also been linked with Chelsea forward Nicolas Jackson in recent weeks as it’s been suggested that he could leave following the arrivals of Liam Delap and Joao Pedro.",
      "However, Romano has indicated that the striker is “not a player for sale”.",
      "“Man Utd have been informed about the situation of Nicolas Jackson,” Romano added.",
      "“He’s not a player for sale because Chelsea are not desperate to sell him. If they get a good proposal, he could leave.",
      "“At the moment, they’ve not started real conversation, so it’s still early stages of any discussion.",
      "“They’re aware what’s going on and are waiting on outgoings, they’re still deciding what striker they want internally and then what happens with the goalkeeper.”",
      "He continued: “We have to see what they will do with the goalkeeper: do they want a new one or a young goalkeeper for the future?",
      "“Or maybe they want to sign an experienced goalkeeper because Emi Martinez keeps hoping for a call from Man Utd. He’s open to a move there.”",
      "According to reports, Leeds United have reached an ‘agreement’ for their sixth summer signing as a deal has been struck with a Bundesliga side.",
      "Arsenal’s move for Viktor Gyokeres has reportedly hit an ‘impasse’ as three ‘issues’ are preventing a deal from being struck with Sporting Lisbon.",

      "According to reports, Manchester United could miss out on two transfer targets, while Fabrizio Romano has revealed an update on another potential signing.",

      "At the end of 2024, Rashford announced his intention to leave Man Utd after butting heads with head coach Ruben Amorim, who failed to kickstart a return to form for the forward at Old Trafford.",
      "Rashford had been heavily criticised due to his poor form and attitude over 18 months and his struggles continued under Amorim before he decided that he needed a fresh start.",
      "However, Rashford’s woes at Man Utd and his huge salary provided stumbling blocks as Barcelona and other European giants opted against a move for the England international.",
      "Aston Villa ended up taking a risk on Rashford, signing him on loan with an option to buy for around £40m after selling Jhon Duran to Al-Nassr.",

      "The report adds:",

      "‘Head coach Hansi Flick has spoken to the 27-year-old England international and approved his arrival.’",

      "This summer has confirmed the existence of the Premier League tax beyond all doubt, with one Arsenal transfer unsurprisingly taking the expensive biscuit.",
      "While no deal completed this summer can challenge the biggest overpays in Premier League history, plenty have already been made well in excess of a player’s reported market value.",
      "A few factors go into that assessment. Age, performance level and experience are inevitably taken into account but the number of interested teams, general market trends and the reputation and status of the leagues the selling and buying clubs belong to can also heavily dictate that that market value.",
      "And when it comes to those increasingly expensive intra-Premier League transfers there is basically a £10m surcharge applied before talks even commence.",
      "It is no coincidence that five of the seven biggest supposed overpays – going by the numbers crunched by the fine folk at Transfermarkt – involve a pair of Premier League clubs both trying to orchestrate PSR-friendly deals.",
      "Nor that Real Madrid account for the other two when they signed Alvaro Carreras and Franco Mastantuono.",
      "But those five Premier League overpays, made by four of the Big Six plus Newcastle, do beg the question as to who has been most royally screwed.",
      "",
      "Noni Madueke (Chelsea to Arsenal)",
      "Fee: £52m\nTransfermarkt valuation at the time: £34.7m",
      "If you listen to Arsenal supporters, which is medically inadvisable at the best of times, the Madueke signing is not only an egregious use of club funds but an act so deeply objectionable as to prompt petitions, protests and defaced murals.",
      "That the line for those deeply ‘entitled’ fans is drawn at their favourite football club making what they deem to be an underwhelming signing, rather than the shameful handling of the Thomas Partey debacle, is a cripplingly damning indictment on the modern world.",
      "But there is a sense that better value than Madueke was out there if Arsenal dared to look beyond Stamford Bridge.",
      "The case for the defence would be that a 23-year-old England international already settled in London and familiar with the Premier League, who can play in and cover more than one position in a shallow attack, is worth stretching the budget for to mitigate any concerns over a player from a different country needing time to acclimatise.",
      "Madueke offering a different skillset to break down those low blocks could also be crucial for an Arsenal side which has proven decidedly one-dimensional and unimaginative at times in their last three years of sustained Premier League title challenges.",
      "The wider outlook would likely have been completely different had Madueke arrived after the long-awaited Proper Striker was captured but as long as a deal for Viktor Gyokeres is finally pushed over the line this summer and a Chelsea cast-off does not represent Arsenal’s biggest attacking addition, those fan frustrations should soon be drowned out.",
      "",
      "Anthony Elanga (Nottingham Forest to Newcastle)",
      "Fee: £52m\nTransfermarkt valuation at the time: £36.4m",
      "Is Anthony Elanga worth £55m? Perhaps only to Newcastle but when the Magpies have understandably identified him as an ideal fit in their counter-attacking system then it hardly matters.",
      "Newcastle had bids of £35m and £50m rejected for Elanga in summer 2024. After a season in which his six goals and 11 assists were crucial in helping secure European qualification for Nottingham Forest, a slight increase for their priority target was palatable.",
      "And if Eddie Howe succeeds in protecting Alexander Isak from the clutches of Liverpool, he has a pair of international teammates who have already established a connection he can coach and nurture.",
      "It is, for the first time since Sandro Tonali two years prior, a signing which represents an immediate first-team upgrade at St James’ Park.",
      "As the most recent scorer of a Champions League knockout stage goal for Manchester United, Elanga even brings a degree of experience to a stage Newcastle are still adjusting to.",
      "",
      "Mohammed Kudus (West Ham to Spurs)",
      "Fee: £55m\nTransfermarkt valuation at the time: £39m",
      "There is always a quirk in the system and the idea Spurs overpaid for Kudus seems curious.",
      "The deal was struck for £30m less than his release clause with a bitter rival, who had three years left on the contract of arguably their most gifted player.",
      "But coming off the back of a season in which Kudus scored five goals, assisted three and suffered a stunning headloss against Spurs themselves resulting in a considerable ban, it could be argued that the Europa League winners paid a little over the odds.",
      "Thomas Frank pinpointed Kudus as his main transfer target because of the “unpredictability” the Ghanaian can provide in attack at “almost the perfect age to perform and hit the next level”.",
      "While moving a player with those characteristics across enemy lines was always going to require some intricate negotiations, Spurs pushed it through at a price both parties could sell as a win.",

      "Fee: £55m\nTransfermarkt valuation at the time: £43.3m",
      "From the competition Chelsea faced for Pedro to the remuneration Brighton were due for their work in developing a former club-record £30m signing, the Brazilian was always going to cost a pretty penny.",
      "Throw into the equation the fees Chelsea consistently pay for forwards in particular – and what is effectively the antithesis of a discount at their favourite shop as Brighton are still making them pay for the Moises Caicedo mess – and it could be suggested that the Blues paid over the odds.",
      "But rarely if ever before has a player paid back their fee so quickly and specifically as with Pedro, whose first three Chelsea goals helped win the Club World Cup and earn Enzo Maresca’s side an extra £30m or so.",
      "",

      "Fee: £62.5m\nTransfermarkt valuation at the time: £52m",
      "The spotlight which comes with a move to Manchester United cannot have surprised Cunha but being scapegoated by Newcastle for their lack of signings and blamed by Sporting for their valuation of Viktor Gyokeres seemed curious.",

      "A multi-functional 26-year-old Brazilian international forward with 42 goal contributions in 82 Premier League appearances does, after all, come with a premium.",

      "Marcus Rashford should be the most sellable member of the five-man Manchester United bomb squad. But he’s not…",
      "When they entered the summer, United were apparently hopeful of raking in around £160million for the five players everyone knows they want rid of.",
      "That, obviously, was ludicrous. The only club daft enough to pay top whack for these lads would be United themselves.",
      "So as the summer rolls on, United remain at an impasse with the transfers, unable to strengthen much further before they get rid of their drifters.",
      "How much can they hope to bank now? Is it possible they will start the season with all five still on their books? Here’s how we rank the unwanted stars based on how likely they are to earn some money for United…",
      "",
      "5) Tyrell Malacia\nPSV opted against taking up their option to sign Malacia for £9million because they’re not daft. The Netherlands defender started only three Eredivisie games after joining in January but at least he proved to any potential suitors that he’s not completely broken having spent over a year on the sidelines.",
      "Ruben Amorim didn’t aid United in their mission to sell Malacia when he revealed the 25-year-old hasn’t got it in him to play as a wing-back because he struggles to go forward. Which feels like something United ought to have spotted earlier but, as we know, they haven’t been the most observant bunch.",
      "So what now? United will apparently accept something like £3million just so Malacia doesn’t show as a loss on the books. Will anyone who can afford his £75,000-a-week salary stump up? Probably not.",
      "",
      "4) Jadon Sancho \nUnited need to hope there is some truth in reports Juventus want both Sancho and Francisco Conceicao since it seems the Old Lady has done a deal to sign the Portuguese winger from Porto.",
      "Regardless, whether it’s Juve or anyone else, United will have to accept they aren’t going to get anything like the £25million they hoped for. Frankly, they’ll be fortunate to bank anything while escorting Sancho off the premises one last time.",
      "The winger is on something ridiculous like £250,000 a week which he is due for another year. Chelsea offered him the chance to get away for less, but that wasn’t for him. Juve certainly won’t pay the same salary – reports suggest he’s being offered half. And we doubt Sancho is motivated enough to give up half of what he’s contractually owed to take up a great opportunity in Turin.",
      "And, to be fair, why should he? It makes sense for Sancho to sit tight, wait for a loan move at the end of the window, when United will have to accept paying only a portion of his salary for the reward of having him out the door. Then, in a year, after another season trousering an undeserved wedge, he gets to go as a free agent.",
      "So, if anyone is daft enough to offer actual money for Sancho, United ought to snap their hand off.",
      "",
      "3) Antony\nAside from Malacia, around whom all is deathly quiet, the least noise among the bomb squad is coming from Antony’s direction. Because it was thought Real Betis would find a way to bring back a winger who regained some credibility while on loan in Spain during the second half of last season.",
      "Can Betis afford to buy? Maybe, probably not. And they are cool with that being known. Because it will squeeze United ever more over a player who clearly has no future under Amorim.",
      "Of course, Betis would prefer Antony back on loan but United insist they won’t do that. At least not without guarantees and the Spaniards are toying with some workarounds. There are reports of interest from elsewhere but nothing firm enough for Betis to panic into making United an offer they might be satisfied to accept. Certainly not yet. And they are content in the knowledge Antony fancies being back in Andalusia.",
      "Apparently, United have already dropped the asking price from £40million to £30million, but they won’t get that either. Certainly not in the form of cold hard cash they can put towards their stalled summer recruitment.",
      "🔴⚪⚫ MORE MAN UTD FROM F365\n👉 Amorim sacked for Xavi as Postecoglou returns: Predicting nine Premier League successors\n👉 Only West Ham more miserable than Man Utd in Premier League mood rankings",
      "",
      "2) Marcus Rashford\nRashford is probably United’s most sellable asset of the five. But that also means he can afford to be pickier when choosing his next move.",
      "Ideally, he would go to Barcelona. A few weeks ago, that appeared something of a pipe dream while Nico Williams was being teased by the Catalans. But Barca’s failure to close a deal for Williams highlights the financial constraints they remain under.",
      "If they can’t buy Williams, they probably can’t buy Rashford. But they can wait until the back end of the window before offering a loan deal with options or obligations, which at least gets the forward’s salary – or most of it – off United’s books.",
      "Barca can bide their time here because they know Rashford’s desire. Without something coming from nothing, the only obvious threat we see here is Bayern Munich, given the Bavarians and Liverpool are way, way off in their valuations of Luis Diaz. And even then, Leandro Trossard could be a cheaper option.",
      "",
      "1) Alejandro Garnacho\nThe Argentina winger probably represents United’s best chance of banking some cash. But certainly not the £70million they initially hoped for. Nor £60million after their first reduction. If they get anything more than half the price they were initially quoting, that’s a result.",
      "Why should they be grateful for that? Because Garnacho would be a risk for anyone taking on the his full rights this summer.",
      "As a player, we know he is limited. He has bursts, moments. For a winger, he’s not rapid and as a right-footer on the left, he struggles to go down the outside.",
      "If that doesn’t make buyers beware, his character ought to. There were red flags around Garnacho’s attitude even before he made his first senior start and all the evidence suggests little has changed.",
      "So the smart suitors will insist on trying before they buy, but someone of the not-unreasonable belief that United is more the problem, not the player, could be tempted by Garnacho. Probably Chelsea.",
      "Marcus Rashford has reportedly sanctioned a gargantuan pay cut to facilitate his loan to Barcelona, who have a ‘verbal agreement’ with Manchester United.",

      "Chelsea are bidding to be the world’s biggest spenders in the summer window for the fourth consecutive season, and they are on course to do so…",
      "All fees and figures are taken from Transfermarkt. The 20 biggest deals of the summer are here.",
      "",
      "10) Como – £87.9m\nThe richest club in Serie A are determined to spend money to secure European football for next season. Jesus Rodriguez is the most expensive of those to arrive so far.",
      "",
      "9) Bayer Leverkusen – £88m\nArmed with money from Liverpool for Florian Wirtz and Jeremie Frimpong, new coach Erik ten Hag has been busy, with US international Malik Tillman coming in for a club-record fee.",
      "CHECK OUT: The F365 transfer rumour power ranking",
      "",
      "8) Atletico Madrid – £92.6m\nAlex Baena, Johnny Cardoso, Thiago Almada and Matteo Ruggeri have all cost a pretty penny and are aged between 22 and 24 as Diego Simeone rebuilds again.",
      "",
      "7) Sunderland – £100.43m\nFive first-team signings have come in to no little cost. And the Black Cats are not finished.",
      "",
      "6) Tottenham – £120.52m\nSpent a decent whack of money spent on Kevin Danso, Mathys Tel, Luka Vuskovic and Kota Takai before Thomas Frank even got a say. Mohammed Kudus had shot Spurs up into the top three before they were overtaken again; Morgan Gibbs-White would get them closer to Liverpool.",
      "",
      "5) Manchester City – £122.1m\nThat’s the price of a Rayan Ait-Nouri from Wolves, a Rayan Cherki from Lyon, a Tijanji Reijnders from AC Milan and a Sverre Nypan from Rosenborg, and all of them feel like bargains.",
      "",
      "4) Arsenal – £127m\nThere is agitation at Arsenal that a nine-figure spend is yet to deliver a shiny new centre-forward but if Viktor Gyokeres does eventually arrive it is likely to be a £200m summer to spark the start of Mikel Arteta’s next phase.",
      "",
      "3) Real Madrid – £144.4m\nThey had already dropped £50m on Dean Huijsen and £8.5m on a few weeks of Trent Alexander-Arnold before they agreed to sign man-child Franco Mastantuono for an awful lot of money. And then came Alvaro Carreras for another £43m.",
      "",
      "2) Liverpool – £194.5m\nFlorian Wirtz has cost an initial £100m (yes, it could rise to £116m but we’re not worried about add-ons on this particular list) and Jeremie Frimpong has cost £29.5m. We have also added the £25m on Giorgi Mamardashvili as that transfer will be counted in this summer’s accounts. And now Milos Kerkez has joined for a cool £40m.",
      "",
      "1) Chelsea – £210.6m\nThey were the top spenders in the summers of 2024, 2023 and 2022 and will be up there in 2025 thanks to pre-arranged moves for Estevao, Dario Essugo, Mamadou Sarr and Kendry Paez. Throw in the £30m signing of Liam Delap and the Blues were already making very expensive waves before they signed Joao Pedro for an initial £55m and Jamie Gittens for not much less."

      "Noni Madueke and Joao Pedro have joined the increasing legion of players swapping Premier League clubs for at least £50m, with more deals to come.",
      "This is the summer of the intra-Premier League transfer but Alexander Isak and others considering future employers closer to home have some way to go to reach this list.",
      "",
      "26) Aaron Wan-Bissaka – £45m rising to £50m (Crystal Palace to Manchester United, June 2019)\nIt is unknown exactly when Manchester United added Wan-Bissaka to an apparent 804-strong list of potential right-backs, but they cannot pretend it was any earlier than about halfway through his first full season of top-flight football.",
      "Crystal Palace cashed in on stock which would never be quite so high, raking in about £1.19m for each of his Premier League career appearances to that point. Wan-Bissaka remains the most expensive uncapped English player ever.",
      "",
      "25) Kyle Walker – £45m rising to £50m (Spurs to Manchester City, July 2017)\nOne prominent journalist called it ‘the moment we all knew the Premier League had lost its mind,’ but even with Walker’s regression as the captain who betrayed Pep Guardiola mid-season his signing was transformational for player and club.",
      "Even if it was wild to see Walker reign as the most expensive defender ever for a few months, he will leave after eight years with about twice as many trophies won.",
      "",
      "24) Amadou Onana – £50m (Everton to Aston Villa, July 2024)\nWith Douglas Luiz forced out in a PSR panic, Aston Villa prepared for their Champions League debut by scouring the Premier League for clubs in similar financial disorder, who also happened to boast one of the country’s better midfielders.",
      "",
      "23) Ben White – £50m (Brighton to Arsenal, July 2021)\nThe laborious false equivalences with Raphael Varane did not last long. Arsenal had a series of bids rejected for a defender whose entire career consisted of a single season in each of League Two, League One, the Championship and the Premier League as Brighton knew what they had and how much it was worth.",
      "",
      "22) Fernando Torres – £50m (Liverpool to Chelsea, January 2011)\nA generationally dreadful British record transfer, yet one which delivered Torres the trophies he craved when leaving Liverpool after a productive but entirely potless three and a half years.",
      "",
      "21) Richarlison – £50m rising to £60m (Everton to Spurs, July 2022)\nWith a ‘nonsense’ and ultimately phantom £85m Barcelona bid firmly in his rear-view mirror, Richarlison and Everton both felt it was time to cash in on four decent, hard-working seasons when Spurs chucked a healthy profit their way.",
      "It has been far from seamless in north London for the Brazilian, who has been hoist by the disallowed-goal-followed-by-booking-for-removing-shirt-when-celebrating petard an absurd number of times. But the bloke has won a Europa League so…",
      "",
      "20) Pedro Neto – £51.4m rising to £54m (Wolves to Chelsea, August 2024)\nArsenal, Manchester City, Newcastle and Spurs were sniffing around but Chelsea live for the hijack and swooped at the latest annual Wolves car boot sale.",
      "Was six goals and nine assists in 45 games across his debut season worth it? Doesn’t matter when you feed off transfer vibes.",
      "",
      "19) Noni Madueke – £52m (Chelsea to Arsenal, July 2025)\nA section of the most ‘entitled’ fanbase in the world ought to have been ashamed at how they rallied against Arsenal’s latest signing of a Chelsea cast-off.",
      "While neither the striker Arsenal need nor the Rodrygo-level wide forward they wanted, Madueke will provide the sort of attacking cover which was painfully lacking in their latest failed title charge.",
      "",
      "18) Anthony Elanga – £52m rising to £55m (Nottingham Forest to Newcastle, July 2025)\nA £15m signing from Manchester United became a potential £55m sale to Newcastle within two years for Nottingham Forest, who could not resist that sweet profit when Eddie Howe kept loitering around the City Ground car park waiting for Elanga.",
      "",
      "17) Matheus Nunes – £53m (Wolves to Manchester City, September 2023)\nThe repurposing of Nunes as a competent right-back should not mask how ludicrous it is that Manchester City can put more than £50m down on a player the manager later publicly decries as “not clever enough” to play in his preferred position.",
      "",
      "16) Romeo Lavia – £53m rising to £58m (Southampton to Chelsea, August 2023)\nThe numbers are a little shady but they paint a compelling picture: Lavia has missed more than three times as many Chelsea games through injury (67) as he has played for the Blues since joining (21).",
      "There is a phenomenal player within but as his own personal physio said recently, “questions gradually arise”.",
      "",
      "15) Mohammed Kudus – £55m (West Ham to Spurs, July 2025)\nThe first player to leave West Ham for Spurs since Scott Parker was identified by Thomas Frank as a priority signing – and a sale the Hammers needed to make before they could embark on their own squad renovations.",
      "West Ham selling a player to a bitter rival for £25m under their reported release clause is fairly damning of Kudus but he will console himself with Champions League football.",
      "",
      "14) Joao Pedro – £55m rising to £60m (Brighton to Chelsea, July 2025)\nNewcastle made a play but their opening bid was knocked back by Brighton and Pedro wanted Chelsea in any case, presumably to guarantee there were some familiar faces to greet him.",
      "“They had brilliant players in the past and have brilliant players now, so I am excited to join and you know when you are a Chelsea player you must think one thing – win,” he said, clearly having never heard of Dan Burn.",
      "",
      "13) Mason Mount – £55m rising to £60m (Chelsea to Manchester United, July 2023)\nYet it is a similar story for a player Lavia might have passed in the Stamford Bridge departures lounge. Mount has missed 50 games through injury since making his move to Manchester United, for whom he has played 46 times.",
      "But obviously Ruben Amorim loves the manager’s dream. “When you see that kind of guy like Mason working hard every day, eating well, having ice baths, when you have this kind of player you just want to help him,” said a head coach who needs some of that assistance to be reciprocated.",
      "",
      "12) Dominic Solanke – £55m rising to £65m (Bournemouth to Spurs, August 2024)\nLiverpool had a buy-back clause but chose not to use it, leaving Spurs with a free hit after Arsenal were ruled out on the basis they do not spend significant sums on actual forwards.",
      "They can hardly be dissatisfied with their lot from a heavily disrupted 16-goal season which culminated with Solanke scoring in three of four Europa League quarter and semi-final legs before lifting the sodding trophy in Bilbao.",
      "",
      "11) Marc Cucurella – £56m rising to £63m (Brighton to Chelsea, August 2022)\nManchester City had offers of £30m and £40m rejected before balking at demands of around £50m. Chelsea picked up the slack and it remains one of the biggest Premier League transfer overpays of all time.",
      "Cucurella has at least started to repay the faith and fee, becoming a bastion of reliability under Enzo Maresca as a European champion with Spain.",
      "",
      "10) Riyad Mahrez – £60m (Leicester to Manchester City, July 2018)\nHad things gone to plan then Mahrez would have honoured only the first season of a four-year contract he signed with newly-crowned Premier League champions Leicester. The Algerian felt he had a gentleman’s agreement that would allow him to walk proudly out of the door in summer 2017 but the Foxes were unmoved.",
      "Mahrez might not regret that delayed exit in retrospect. It allowed Pep Guardiola to crystallise his interest in a player who would win 10 further trophies at the Etihad.",
      "",
      "Cunha only finished one place lower with Wolves but that was not for his own lack of effort or ability in a season spent scoring 17 goals, assisting six and apologising countless times for intimating that he would quite like to leave at some point.",
      "",
      "8) Kai Havertz – £65m (Chelsea to Arsenal, June 2023)\nRarely has a transfer ever continued to polarise the footballing world long after it was made quite so fundamentally as Arsenal throwing their new-found title weight behind a Chelsea cast-off.",
      "When Arsenal needed a Proper Striker it was decided by Mikel Arteta that a sort of centre-forward would do, even though he was signed as Granit Xhaka’s midfield successor at the time. A total of 42 combined goals and assists in 87 games is a fine record for a player whose strengths are ignored and shortcomings highlighted like few others.",
      "",
      "7) Wesley Fofana – £70m rising to £75m (Leicester to Chelsea, August 2022)\nThe final boss of the Lavia-Mount strand of player. Fofana has missed 105 club games through injury while contracted to Chelsea, for whom he has played 34 times.",
      "The Frenchman is still 19 Blues games from surpassing the number of appearances he made for Leicester. Thomas Tuchel was in charge when they signed him!",
      "",
      "6) Virgil van Dijk – £75m (Southampton to Liverpool, January 2018)\nLiverpool received a slapped wrist for their ‘illegal approach’ of Van Dijk but the inevitable could only be delayed for so long by Southampton.",
      "More than seven years later it looks like Saints were fleeced if anything.",
      "",
      "5) Romelu Lukaku – £75m rising to £90m (Everton to Manchester United, July 2017)\nThe transfer narrative that defined summer 2017 revolved around Lukaku, Alvaro Morata, Manchester United, Chelsea and some quite uncomfortable comparative undertones.",
      "There were precisely no winners from the sorry old mess. It is a great bit that former Chelsea and Manchester United striker Lukaku’s three best goalscoring Premier League seasons were with Everton and West Brom.",
      "",
      "4) Harry Maguire – £80m (Leicester to Manchester United, August 2019)\nAnother player Manchester City flirted with before, in Guardiola’s words, it was decided the club with a basically unlimited budget “could not afford it”, Maguire was Manchester United’s answer to the conundrum Liverpool posed with Van Dijk: what if teams actually spent considerable money on a centre-half?",
      "Maguire’s greatest asset since has been mental resilience. He was stripped of a captaincy awarded to him within half a year of joining and has been ostracised by two managers before both realised their mistake and brought him back into the fold.",
      "",
      "3) Jack Grealish – £100m (Aston Villa to Manchester City, August 2021)\nA player so good Aston Villa had to sign three before he left to replace him.",
      "Grealish was the free-running show pony in a modest stable, who will soon be turned to glue or lasagna after being consumed by the great Manchester City outdoors.",
      "",
      "2) Declan Rice – £100m rising to £105m (West Ham to Arsenal, July 2023)\nArsenal played an absolute blinder in laying the groundwork before keeping the bidding at a controlled level. Manchester City made one offer and promptly withdrew from the race upon its rejection, leaving the Gunners with a clear track.",
      "Rice will probably have to at least match his West Ham trophy haul of one at Arsenal for the signing to be considered a success, but any shortcoming on that front thus far has certainly not been his.",
      "",
      "1) Moises Caicedo – £100m rising to £115m (Brighton to Chelsea, August 2023)\nChelsea, however, made an absolute mess of their record move for a midfield cheat code that summer, but Caicedo has ultimately rendered that moot by growing into his role impeccably.",
      "A new report has revealed the ‘most realistic solution’ for Manchester City and England star Jack Grealish amid interest from Premier League rivals.",
      "Jack Grealish looks destined to leave Man City this summer but a £300k-a-week wage has made it hard for clubs to take the risk.",
      "Mohammed Kudus and Morgan Gibbs-White are desperate to take a step down to complete dream Spurs moves, few players having ever done so at greater expense.",
      "Newcastle United are reportedly interested in signing two England internationals, including Manchester City winger Jack Grealish.",
      "Daniel Levy probably needs to stop offering transfer add-ons based on ‘difficult objectives’ like Spurs winning the Premier League or Champions League.",
      "Every Cruyff turn is a footprint. Some players leave lasting impressions; others barely register. Was peak Eden Hazard the very best?"

      "Romano tweeted: ‘Chelsea and Arsenal among clubs attentive to Xavi Simons situation this summer. He’s prepared to leave Leipzig as revealed since May and Premier League top clubs are informed. No bids or talks yet. Nothing concrete with Barça so far.’",
      "Spanish outlet Sport claim that Manchester United are also in the mix, joining Chelsea in holding ‘meetings with Simon’s entourage to discuss a potential move’, though the Red Devils’ long-awaited but now seemingly imminent signing of Bryan Mbeumo from Brentford likely rules them out of the race.",

      "Manchester United want a striker after agreeing to pay Brentford more than they originally asked for Bryan Mbeumo. Time for some sales, lads…",
      "With so much transfer talk doing the rounds, we’re here through the summer to sift through the bullsh*t and highlight the whispers that might have some substance.",
      "Each day we’re ranking the top 20 rumours involving Premier League clubs, the higher the link, the more likely we feel they are to become done deals.",
      "So we start with the tittle-tattle…",
      "",
      "20) 🔽 Alexander Isak – Newcastle to Liverpool\nIt seems as though Liverpool have taken Newcastle seriously when they were told that Isak isn’t for sale. And the intent the Reds are showing around Ekitike instead douses our suspicion that Dicky Hughes wasn’t done with Isak.",
      "",
      "19) 🆕 Rasmus Hojlund – Manchester United to AC Milan\nMilan are looking into the feasibility of signing Hojlund as they search for a striker. United paid Atalanta £72million two years ago and the Rossoneri would struggle to give the Red Devils half of their money back. And even if Hojlund has struggled, from a numbers perspective, United simply cannot afford to shed any strikers since Hojlund is the only senior specialist centre-forward they currently have.",
      "",
      "18) 🆕 Marcus Rashford – Manchester United to Juventus\nSky in Italy reckon Juve have ‘begun to explore the conditions’ around a deal to sign Rashford. Which is presumably when they discover they can’t afford him without one or two parties making serious concessions. Like Barcelona, the Old Lady would have to wait until United get desperate and start considering loans.",
      "",
      "17) Jadon Sancho – Manchester United to Juventus\nIt seems Juve have finally agreed a deal with Porto for Francisco Conceicao which, presumably, will supress the Old Lady’s appetite for Sancho. And with the talk of Juve interest in Rashford, what now for Sancho?",
      "",
      "16) 🆕 Nicolas Jackson – Chelsea to Aston Villa\nJackson was rumoured to be of interest to Manchester United but Unai Emery is said to be keen to be reunited with the striker with whom he worked at Villarreal. Villa’s interest in Jackson is heavily linked to…",
      "",
      "15) 🆕 Morgan Rogers – Aston Villa to Chelsea\nRogers is said to be Chelsea priority for the remainder of the window and while Villa are reluctant to sell, any big offer would have to be considered. If Rogers is to join Chelsea, likely triggering a Villa move for Jackson, it won’t be long before the end of the window.",
      "",
      "14) Benjamin Sesko – RB Leipzig to Manchester United\nSesko is back in the 20 after losing out to Gyokeres in Arsenal audition but, apparently, United are ‘serious’ about signing the Slovenian. Maybe they are, and Christ knows they need a striker, but they will have to start selling sharpish if they are to afford what Leipzig are demanding.",

      "",
      "13) Marc Guehi – Crystal Palace to Liverpool\nWith a year left on his contract and a renewal unlikely, Palace are willing to cash in on their captain – but Liverpool won’t pay the £50million or so the Eagles are demanding. Currently, we are at stalemate. Liverpool don’t seem twitchy yet, but they are keeping the lines of communication open.",
      "",
      "12) 🔼 Alejandro Garnacho – Manchester United to Chelsea\nChelsea are selling one winger for £52million and reports suggest they could sign a replacement (do they really need one?) for £40million in the shape of Garnacho. The Blues were keen in January and, unbelievably, nothing between then and now has put them off the Argentinian, perhaps due to the discount on the hefty price they were quoted at the start of the year. Garnacho’s got to go somewhere.",
      "",
      "11) Eberechi Eze – Crystal Palace to Arsenal\nEze is keen on the prospect of moving to the Emirates and some reports suggest a deal is now down to the finer details of how the fee to activate his release clause is paid. Arsenal are a little tied up this week with Madueke and Gyokeres, but once those deals are done, we can expect some progress over Eze.",
      "",
      "10) Marcus Rashford – Manchester United to Barcelona\nWith Nico Williams signing a new contract with Athletic Bilbao and Liverpool ignoring interest in Luis Diaz, Rashford is said to have found himself at the top of Barca’s wish-list and the Catalans are ready to go ‘all in’. Unfortunately for Barca – and United – ‘all’ doesn’t amount to much these days. Rashford wants the move and, most likely, United will be paying him to play as a loanee at the Nou Camp next season.",
      "",
      "9) 🆕 Yoanne Wissa – Brentford to Newcastle\nNewcastle seem to have switched their sights from Ekitike to Wissa. But there could be more bad news for the Mags. Man Utd seem to have finally got their mitts on Bryan Mbeumo, which makes it less likely the Bees will entertain interest in Wissa too.",
      "",
      "8) 🔼 Luis Diaz – Liverpool to Bayern Munich\nBayern made their move for Diaz, who wants to make a move of his own. But Liverpool wouldn’t entertain the bid of £58.6million, with the Reds insisting they want to keep the Colombian, though £87million might twist their arm. There seems to be an openness from all sides to a deal, with Diaz keen to make it happen. Bayern will return with an improved offer but the player may have to do his bit too.",
      "",
      "7) Evan Ferguson – Brighton to Roma\nAfter a loan spell at West Ham in which he did absolutely nothing, Ferguson is now close to joining Roma on loan, with some claiming the Italians will retain the option to buy. Sounds like a great opportunity for a striker once rated at £100million to kickstart his stalling career, assuming the two clubs can find an agreement over a fee should the loan become a permanent arrangement. Lord knows they’ve been discussing it for long enough.",
      "",
      "",
      "5) 🔼 Cristhian Mosquera – Valencia to Arsenal\nArsenal had one bid rejected for the 2024 Golden Boy-shortlisted defender but they remain in talks with Valencia. Which didn’t appear to be going well, but Ornstein suggests the Gunners are getting there. And Mosquera’s farewell message suggests it is heading in the right direction.",
      "",
      "4) Hugo Ekitike – Eintracht Frankfurt to Liverpool\nNewcastle saw the writing on the wall and backed away quietly, leaving Liverpool to argue the toss with Eintracht. Their first offer worth £70million was rejected and, to be fair to the Germans, the suggestion has always been that they want £85million. And since Liverpool were prepared to go way above that for Isak, Eintracht will try to squeeze Liverpool for all they are worth, even if Ekitike is keen to move to Anfield.",
      "",
      "3) 🔼 Viktor Gyokeres – Sporting to Arsenal\nSo many claims and counter claims now, we had almost given up trying to keep up. But this seems to be reaching what felt like the inevitable conclusion. Gyokeres’ representatives were apparently in London at the start of the week, and removal vans have been seen shifting furniture from his home in Portugal. If Arteta wants the striker on the plane for the pre-season tour, this needs to progress significantly in the next 24 hours.",
      "",
      "2) 🔼 Bryan Mbeumo – Brentford to Manchester United\nWe have a deal! United have spent weeks haggling, only to pay more than Brentford’s initial asking price. But a medical is set to take place over the weekend before Mbeumo flies off to the United States with his new team-mates. Now for a striker. And some sales.",
      "",
      "1) 🔼 Noni Madueke – Chelsea to Arsenal\nThe Chelsea winger will be unveiled by Arsenal any time now after a £52million move. Which will prompt some screeching U-turns among the Arsenal fan base, you would expect."

      "15-year season tickets, 40% of the capacity going to the corporates and an ‘American-style matchday experiences’ are all part of the new stadium proposals Man Utd have put to their fans.",
      "In March, the club announced plans to build a new stadium which will see the current Old Trafford knocked down. Now, with a date of 2030 set for opening, the club has asked for their fans’ verdicts on a number of measures that could come into effect when the new stadium is up and running.",
      "As revealed by Cheeses Of Nazareth, a Twitter account focused on United ticket details, the club reached out to supporters to take part in discussions about proposals for the new stadium.",
      "Although attendance was reportedly low, the club did set out a number of discussion points.",
      "First up, there was the idea of a long-term season ticket contract which involves paying a large upfront fee to secure your seat for 15 years or more. Purchasing this would also secure your seat from being reallocated should the club decide that was needed.",
      "Another proposal was that 40% of the 100,000-seater stadium would be for hospitality, including ‘premium viewing areas’ on the halfway line.",
      "Speaking of premium, that was a suggestion for a new model of season ticket which would give fans better chances of securing away tickets, access to concerts at the ground and premium stadium areas.",
      "But perhaps the suggestion that would most go against a typical English view of football is the ‘American-style Matchday Experience.’ This would see the concourse extended to include 360-degree screen bars, multiple smaller merchandise outlets instead of a single large megastore and the ability to move around the concourse with your ticket.",
      "This idea is not unique to United with clubs like Tottenham already having such a system in place.",
      "At the time of the stadium’s announcement, co-owner Jim Ratcliffe said he wanted it to be not just the “the world’s greatest football stadium” but also “the catalyst for social and economic renewal of the Old Trafford area.”",
      "“Today marks the start of an incredibly exciting journey to the delivery of what will be the world’s greatest football stadium, at the centre of a regenerated Old Trafford,” Ratcliffe said.",
      "“Our current stadium has served us brilliantly for the past 115 years, but it has fallen behind the best arenas in world sport. By building next to the existing site, we will be able to preserve the essence of Old Trafford, while creating a truly state-of-the-art stadium that transforms the fan experience, only footsteps from our historic home.",
      "“Just as important is the opportunity for a new stadium to be the catalyst for social and economic renewal of the Old Trafford area, creating jobs and investment, not just during the construction phase, but on a lasting basis when the stadium district is complete.",
      "“The Government has identified infrastructure investment as a strategic priority, particularly in the north of England, and we are proud to be supporting that mission with this project of national, as well as local, significance.”",

Contract agreed weeks ago with Mbeumo as he only wanted Man United move. After Cunha, Mbeumo next for #MUFC.’",

      "He added: ‘Bryan Mbeumo’s contract at Manchester United will be valid until June 2030 plus option until June 2031. Man United wanted the +1 option and it’s been included in the agreement.’",

      "Another report in The Athletic has claimed that Man Utd are attempting to make life ‘difficult’ for the five members of the club’s ‘bomb squad’.",

      "‘Not everybody at United agrees with the decision to limit their access to evening hours, however, given the relationships they have with people at the club. There is also the fear that ostracising them lowers their value in the transfer market, an awkward look at a time when ordinary workers are being laid off to cut costs.’",

      "Chelsea and Arsenal are responsible for five of the 20 most expensive goalkeeper signings in history, with Liverpool sitting pretty.",
      "",
      "1) Kepa Arrizabalaga – £71.6m/€80m (Athletic Bilbao to Chelsea, August 2018)\nDespite never coming close to convincing at Stamford Bridge, the world’s most expensive keeper has racked up over 100 Premier League appearances and more clean sheets than Antti Niemi, who is actually 53. His best season as a Chelsea player was on loan at Bournemouth, mind. And now Arsenal might sign him for £5m.",
      "",
      "2) Alisson – £67m/€75m (Roma to Liverpool, July 2018)\n“Chelsea were changing their manager and not playing in the Champions League. I’ve also always admired Liverpool’s history. This is a club with five European Cups in their trophy cabinet. I really wanted to be part of that history,” said Alisson of his decision to join the Reds instead of the Blues in summer 2018. Having won it all at Anfield, it’s difficult to argue he chose wrong.",
      "",
      "3) Andre Onana – £43.9m/€51m (Inter to Man Utd, July 2023)\nTwelve months after joining Inter from Ajax as a free agent, Champions League finalist Onana reunited with Erik ten Hag as part of an Old Trafford revolution which has not quite gone to plan.",
      "",
      "4) Thibaut Courtois – £35m/€38.8m (Chelsea to Real Madrid, August 2018)\nThe desire of Courtois to leave Chelsea set in motion three of the four most expensive goalkeeper transfers in history. After starring in the 2018 World Cup, the Belgian forced a move to Real Madrid through and has 12 trophies to show for the subsequent seven years.",
      "",
      "5) Ederson – £34.7m/€40m (Benfica to Manchester City, June 2017)\nClaudio Bravo gave it a go but that went so well he lost his place mid-season to Willy Caballero, so Pep Guardiola went out and placed all his eggs in the basket of an uncapped 23-year-old with 74 top-flight career appearances. As it turns out: fair call.",
      "",
      "6) Gianluigi Buffon – £32.6m/€51.9m (Parma to Juventus, July 2001)\nFor almost 16 years, Buffon reigned as the world’s most expensive goalkeeper – and it took no little inflation and conversion nonsense to dethrone him. Juventus got their money’s worth in 22 trophies, a record number of Serie A clean sheets and a historic amount of Champions League bottling.",
      "",
      "7) Jasper Cillessen – £31.4m/€35m (Barcelona to Valencia, June 2019)\nValencia finished fourth in the two seasons before spending a small fortune on a 30-year-old keeper who played five La Liga games in three years with Barcelona; Los Che came 9th, 12th and 9th again before Cillessen left.",
      "",
      "8) Jordan Pickford – £30m/€34m (Sunderland to Everton, June 2017)\nThere was mild disbelief at the time and some remain unconvinced but Everton signed Pickford upon his relegation to the Championship with Sunderland and no individual has played a bigger role in ensuring the same fate has not befallen the Toffees since.",
      "",
      "9) Aaron Ramsdale – £30m/€35.5m (Sheffield United to Arsenal, August 2021)\nSuccessive Premier League relegations with Bournemouth and Sheffield United did not deter Arsenal, who planned to bleed Ramsdale in slowly before realising he’s rather good. But not as good as…",
      "",
      "10) David Raya – £27m/€31.9m (Brentford to Arsenal, July 2024)\nAn initial loan was only ever designed to circumvent PSR issues before eventually and inevitably being made permanent by Arsenal, who navigated some incredibly tiresome discourse around their goalkeepers and have been proven entirely right in making their ruthless upgrade.",
      "",
      "11) Alex Meret – £26.25m/€35m (Udinese to Napoli, July 2018)\nA Coppa Italia winner’s medal, saving from Paulo Dybala in the final shootout, and a Scudetto after fighting back from a rotational role to become regular starter again – that’s not a bad return.",
      "",
      "12) Giorgi Mamardashvili – £25m/€30m (Valencia to Liverpool, August 2024)\nWith a keen eye on the future, Liverpool signed Mamardashvili and lent him back to Valencia for one more campaign of seasoning before heading to Anfield to presumably challenge Alisson for the gloves.",
      "",
      "13) Manuel Neuer – £24.3m/€30m (Schalke to Bayern Munich, June 2011)\nBayern Munich supporters quite hilariously protested against the signing of Neuer over some daft grudge to do with Oliver Kahn. Twelve Bundesligas and a couple of Champions Leagues might have won them over by now.",
      "",
      "14) Francesco Toldo – £23.85m/€28.4m (Fiorentina to Inter, July 2001)\nThe prospect of following Buffon was reportedly one factor behind Toldo rejecting a move to Parma during the great Italian goalkeeper merry-go-round of 2001. I Gialloblu signed Sebastien Frey from Inter instead, leading Toldo straight into the arms of I Nerazzurri for the same fee Parma had previously agreed with Fiorentina, who replaced the outgoing Italy international with Arsenal champion and Liverpool legend Alex Manninger.",
      "",
      "15) Neto – £23.3m/€26m (Valencia to Barcelona, June 2019)\nAs part of the bloated Cillessen deal, Barcelona received Neto in exchange as back-up for Marc-Andre ter Stegen.",
      "",
      "16) Bernd Leno – £22.3m/€25m (Bayer Leverkusen to Arsenal, June 2018)\nArsenal signing a German goalkeeper evoked all sorts of beautiful memories but Leno was neither mad nor Invincible. He replaced Petr Cech before himself being phased out for Ramsdale, as the circle of life between the Emirates sticks dictates.",
      "",
      "17) Djordje Petrovic – £22m/€28.8m (Chelsea to Bournemouth, July 2025)\nThe Chelsea transfer ethos in action: a player they signed for £12m on a seven-year contract and who played as many games for the Blues as Strasbourg was sold for almost twice as much within two years.",
      "",
      "18) Edouard Mendy – £22m/€24m (Rennes to Chelsea, September 2020)\nHe came, he saw, he looked genuinely brilliant at times, he won the Champions League, Super Cup, Club World Cup, Africa Cup of Nations, Best FIFA Men’s Goalkeeper award and Champions League Goalkeeper of the Season award all within a few months of each other, he had some contractual disagreements, he lost his place, he left for Saudi Arabia. What a whirlwind.",
      "",
      "19) Joan Garcia – £21.3m/€25m (Espanyol to Barcelona, June 2025)\nArsenal were known to be sniffing around but with Barcelona eager to enact a Ter Stegen succession plan, they triggered Garcia’s release clause to make their first signing direct from Espanyol in 31 years.",
      "",
      "20) Pau Lopez – £21m/€23.5m (Real Betis to Roma, July 2019)\nWith not a single competitive appearance for Spurs in an all-fated 2016/17 loan under his arm, Lopez bounced back with a season at Real Betis impressive enough to catch the eye of Roma, who he left to join Marseille for about half of Roma’s initial outlay two and a half years later.",

However, no club has yet been able to meet the player’s financial demands. If the offers he wants from Europe’s top leagues don’t come through, Rashford might consider Turkey. In that case, Fenerbahçe would take the lead in this transfer.’",

      "Manchester United have agreed a £71m fee with Brentford for Bryan Mbeumo but once Sir Jim Ratcliffe remembers he ‘won’t be held ransom’ they will need to find an alternative.",
      "After starting the bidding at £50m rising to £55m in early June and privately stressing the need to be patient, Manchester United have found an agreement with Brentford worth an initial £65m with £6m in add-ons.",
      "It is exceptional work as ever from the recruitment team, who might soon get cold feet and need to look at some alternatives.",
      "We took a look at FBRef for options across Europe’s top five leagues that have very similar characteristics to Mbeumo, which amusingly features one current Manchester United player they’re desperate to be rid of and one a club has just made a £40m profit on after signing him from United two years ago.",
      "",
      "Alex Berenguer (Athletic Club)\nProbably not the Athletic Club forward the fans would be dreaming of signing this summer, but if Barcelona and Arsenal can’t persuade Nico Williams to join them there’s not much hope for United. And they in turn are in absolutely no position to be sniffy about a 30-year-old winger who got more league goal contributions (14) last season than any of their players aside from Bruno Fernandes (18).",
      "",
      "Mattia Zaccagni (Lazio)\nThere’s interest from Nottingham Forest in the Lazio captain as they prepare for inevitable defeat to Tottenham in the not-so-secret Morgan Gibbs-White release clause saga, and without the funds to build a squad which aligns with the fanciful INEOS strategy of developing young talent with significant sell-on value, moves for relatively inexpensive but experienced footballers like Zaccagni make a lot of sense. It’s a ploy that’s worked famously for Inter Milan.",
      "",
      "Xavi Simons (RB Leipzig)\nHe’s a player we’re sure United would have been making a move for had they qualified for the Champions League – he would be ideal in the 3-4-3. As it stands, their Europa League vanquishers Tottenham are interested, as are Bayern Munich. Probably Bayern Munich then.",
      "",
      "Anthony Gordon (Newcastle)\nThe supposed similarity between Gordon and their primary target should perhaps raise United alarms as to the suitability of Mbeumo to the inverted winger role as Gordon is a proper winger’s winger – paint on the soles of his boots and all that.",
      "That said, we’re pretty sure Amorim wouldn’t turn down the opportunity to sign Gordon should he miraculously become an option.",
      "",
      "Alex Iwobi (Everton)\nHe was low-key excellent last season, with his nine Premier League goals and six assists comfortably beating his best previous return of 11 goal contributions in 2018/2019 for Arsenal. Primed for a £20m late-window bid before Fulham ask for an added £20m in United tax.",
      "",
      "Inaki Williams (Athletic Club)\nCan’t be easy living in his brother’s shadow, though we’re guessing the £220,000 Inaki gets a week to play football eases the pain somewhat. He’s not about to leave a club in the Champions League and even United won’t fork out those wages.",
      "",
      "Marcus Rashford (Manchester United)\nJust brilliant. Not just because United are doing everything in their power to get him out of the club but also because he was deemed unsuited to Amorim’s system in the short time he was playing for him.",
      "And yes, we get the argument that Amorim has shown strength of character in showing ‘bad apples’ the door no matter their talent, but there won’t be a Red Devils fan out there not wondering – even briefly – whether a softer approach may have led to Rashford thriving at his boyhood club rather than at Aston Villa in the second half of last season and wherever he finds himself next term while United pay half his wages.",
      "",
      "Anthony Elanga (Newcastle)\nWe’re 99 per cent sure United would have rivalled Newcastle for Elanga’s £55m signing this summer had it not required an embarrassing climbdown after they sold him to Nottingham Forest for £15m two years ago.",
      "A report emerged after his stunning goal against United in April that while ‘there was an appreciation at the club for his phenomenal physical talents’, the club let him go due to ‘reservations over how he would parlay those skills into breaking down stubborn defences’.",
      "United do not now hold what we would suggest would have been the very same ‘reservations’ back then over a move for Mbeumo.",
      "",
      "Justin Kluivert (Bournemouth)\nHe’s someone we could genuinely see United genuinely pivoting to if they miss out on Mbeumo. A 26-year-old who’s perfect for one of those roles behind the central striker, coming off the back of a standout season playing for a club not in European competition with no more than an outside chance of achieving that feat in the coming campaign. A prime candidate.",
      "",
      "Cody Gakpo (Liverpool)\nBayern are supposedly keen and we’re currently at a point where we wouldn’t be particularly surprised by any forward either leaving or joining Liverpool. We would be surprised if any of them joined Manchester United.",
      "Marcus Rashford has reportedly sanctioned a gargantuan pay cut to facilitate his loan to Barcelona, who have a ‘verbal agreement’ with Manchester United.",
      "According to reports, FC Barcelona are ‘advancing’ to sign Manchester United outcast Marcus Rashford, with David Ornstein revealing two key details.",
      "According to reports, Manchester United are set to make a ‘significant move’ for their next signing after Brentford forward Bryan Mbeumo.",

      "Saturday 19 July 2025 21:51, UK",
      "Manchester United began their pre-season campaign with a goalless draw against newly-promoted Leeds in Stockholm.",
      "After Ruben Amorim's side recorded their worst-scoring Premier League campaign last term with 44 goals, there were little signs of improvement in front of goal despite starting new £62.5m signing Matheus Cunha, who played the first half.",
      "In fact, Leeds arguably looked the most threatening over the course of the 90 minutes, with Daniel Farke's side having more of the ball in the first half and plenty more chances to take the lead after half-time.",
      "Teenage striker Chido Obi, who started alongside Cunha and Bruno Fernandes in Amorim's attack, had United's best first-half opportunities as he tested Karl Darlow from a tight angle.",
      "The 17-year-old then took the ball off Cunha's toes inside the area - a demonstration of the work still to be done on the training ground to get Amorim's attack on song. Casemiro's deflected cross also crashed off the Leeds crossbar in first-half stoppage time.",
      "Amorim then changed his entire starting XI at half-time but it was Leeds, who also made wholesale changes including giving a debut to Sean Longstaff, who had the better of the second period.",
      "Half-time substitute Joel Piroe set up two big chances for Jaden Bogle and two for Largie Ramazani, but the Whites could only find Tom Heaton's gloves on every occasion. Ao Tanaka also fired wide after a corner was flicked into his path at the far post.",
      "Amorim's United thought they had a penalty when Patrick Dorgu was brought down by Sam Chambers but the referee waved it on, with the wing-back then forcing Illan Meslier into a decent save.",
      "Man Utd then had the best chance of the afternoon as the clock ticked into 90 as Kobbie Mainoo hit the bar from a corner from just two yards out, with Ayden Heaven finding Meslier on the rebound from a similar distance.",
      "Their problems were summarised with their last big chance of the game as Rasmus Hojlund got in the way of Dorgu's goal-bound effort.",

      "\"We have a lack of pace. Especially in the middle of the park, you can feel it's hard to bring the ball. But we created chances. We have a lot to do, but it was a first test against a Premier League team with two different teams. A good test.",
      "\"Matheus Cunha showed what we need, a player in between the lines who is really aggressive. We watched that during last season for a different team [Wolves]. We expect the same thing.",
      "\"You can see the connection with him and Bruno Fernandes is still not there. But it will be a good connection, because you can put a player like Kobbie Mainoo or Mason Mount there. We need to increase our quality in the final third.\"",

      "\"The environment is really good. Of course sometimes we are going to struggle, but what I felt in the first moment is that if we are going to struggle, we will struggle together. That is the beginning of everything. Then we have to put the quality. This club is not just about the effort, it's about the quality. We have to win games.",

      "Yes, it's the first game of pre-season which can lead to freak results anywhere. But no goals from 19 shots, players missing from a few yards out and even team-mates getting in the way of each other. A lot of work is needed on Amorim's training ground.",
      "A lot of eyes were on Cunha's first run-out but his 45 minutes featured very few sparks. The £62.5m signing from Wolves failed to get a shot away and to touch the ball in the opposition box.",
      "Obi taking the ball off Cunha's toes and Amorim admitting his relationship with Fernandes \"is not there yet\" meant it was a slow start in his new colours.",
      "And Hojlund's display showed more frustration - falling over the ball at one stage in the box and then getting in the way of a late Dorgu strike.",
      "There were a few positives for Amorim as Leon looks a promising player at wing-back - though he was caught ball-watching at times as Leeds and Bogle rampaged down his flank.",
      "Goalkeeper Heaton was one of the few United players who came out of that game with a bit of credit, making three or four sharp saves to put his name in the hat for the United No 1 spot, with Andre Onana currently out injured. Talk about scraping the barrel though…",
      "Amad Diallo also looked sharp at wing-back - which is important in the context of Mbeumo coming into the team.",
      "But United need a lot more than the Brentford man to improve this attacking set-up. There's still a need for a new striker, plus more clarity in midfield and out wide.",
      "There's now less than a month to go until United's Premier League opener with Arsenal. An awful lot still needs to change on the pitch if Amorim's project is going to take off.",
      "Leeds manager Daniel Farke has announced that Patrick Bamford is no longer in his plans for next season.",
      "Farke said on Bamford's future: \"I had an honest communication with him.",

      "Man Utd have admired Bryan Mbeumo for some time and feel he is a good fit for Ruben Amorim's system; United submitted an improved offer worth £71m on Thursday; the forward is expected to have a medical at United in the coming days and be part of the club's preseason tour of the US",
      "By Lyall Thomas and Dharmesh Sheth",
      "Saturday 19 July 2025 18:56, UK",
      "Manchester United have reached an agreement with Brentford to sign Bryan Mbeumo in a deal worth up to £71m, with the player set to have a medical this weekend.",
      "After weeks of protracted talks and rejected bids, the clubs agreed a package on Friday that includes a guaranteed £65m payment to be made in four instalments, as well as £6m in add-ons.",
      "United hope the Cameroon international's move will be completed in time to include him on the plane to the USA on Tuesday for their pre-season tour, and as their second signing of the summer after Matheus Cunha joined from Wolves.",
      "United had been in talks with Brentford for over month for Mbeumo, making a previous offer of £55m plus £7.5m in add-ons over a fortnight ago, which was rejected.",
      "That was after Spurs had held talks with Brentford for the player, with Thomas Frank keen to bring him to North London.",
      "But Mbeumo, who had two years left on his Brentford contract, always preferred a move To Old Trafford.",
      "It is understood the add-ons for Mbeumo are very achievable - mostly based on appearances and goals in the Premier League, meaning it is likely Brentford get close to £70m for him.",
      "If United can resurrect their trophy-winning form under Ruben Amorim then it is even more likely the fee reaches the full £71m.",
      "The likely extras mean Brentford stand to make more than £60m in profit on a player they signed for just £4m from Troyes in 2019, and who went on to score 70 goals, as well as making over 50 more for team-mates.",
      "United had been encouraged and impressed by Mbeumo's desire to join them, but Brentford have made it clear they would find it difficult to sell both him and Yoane Wissa, with interest intensifying in the Congo striker in the last week.",
      "Newcastle stepped their pursuit after seeing Liverpool move ahead of them in the race for Hugo Ekitike. Nottingham Forest also had a bid rejected for Wissa, while Spurs have been considering him since January.",
      "It may be the case that this shift in dynamic around Wissa sparked United into their successful offer for Mbeumo, with a striker next on the agenda for Amorim and the recruitment hierarchy.",
      "They have explored the conditions of a deal for a number of strikers including Aston Villa's Ollie Watkins, Sporting's Viktor Gyokeres, and Chelsea's Nicolas Jackson.",
      "United have been tracking his development for a number of years, back to when he was playing for RB Salzburg, and while Arsenal held preliminary talks for Sesko, a deal never progressed and they are now close to signing Gyokeres.",
      "A heavy focus for Manchester United will also be on exits.",
      "Barcelona have reached a broad agreement to sign Marcus Rashford on loan, while Alejandro Garnacho, Antony, Jadon Sancho and Tyrell Malacia have been given extra time off to explore potential moves away.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo scored 20 goals in the Premier League last season to help Brentford secure a top-half finish - only three players scored more.",
      "He also notched seven assists but should have registered more, clocking a league-topping 9.26 expected assists during the campaign - primarily from delivering a table-topping 202 crosses.",
      "Additionally, only two players covered more distance or attempted more sprints for the season, making him one of the hardest grafters in the league. He also provides serious pace - clocking the fourth-fastest speed at 36.63 km/h.",
      "Factoring in decisive goals or assists that changed the outcomes of games, his 27 goal contributions earned Brentford 22 points - equating to 40 per cent of the Bees' season tally.",

      "Man Utd made a quick and assertive start to the summer transfer window by signing Matheus Cunha, and have been pursuing Brentford's Bryan Mbeumo, while Bruno Fernandes has turned down a move to Saudi Arabia; how could all three fit into Ruben Amorim's team next season?",
      "Saturday 19 July 2025 12:51, UK",
      "Manchester United's road back has begun.",
      "For all the disappointment of last season's 15th-place finish and no trophies to soften the blow, there have been some minor reasons to be optimistic about the current campaign.",
      "Matheus Cunha is in the building after his move from Wolves - but he may not be the only major forward coming into Old Trafford. Bryan Mbeumo's preference to join United - despite other elite clubs in the running - is a positive sign, with agreement having now been reached over a £71 million deal for the Cameroon international.",
      "On top of that, captain Bruno Fernandes has turned down the temptation of a money-fuelled Saudi Arabia move that could have given United more money to rebuild the team. The project is far from being alive again, but it's a start.",
      "\"Cunha and Mbeumo have Premier League experience, and are the right type,\" said Gary Neville. But that is not the only reason those two have been categorised as the answer to United's problems.",
      "Putting the ball in the back of the net proved to be an issue for United last season. They ranked sixth for chances created but finished second bottom for converting shots into goals, while they were also fourth bottom for shot accuracy.",
      "Overall, United failed to score in 15 Premier League matches last season - only relegated Southampton and Leicester managed more. Eleven of those matches were under Amorim.",
      "They also had the second-worst Expected Goals underperformance record in the division, with the numbers saying they should have scored at least nine more goals than their final league tally of 44.",
      "This is where Cunha and Mbeumo could help - if last season's performances are anything to go by.",
      "As United floundered in front of goal, Mbeumo was the league's best overperformer in terms of xG. Using the same process as above, the Bees forward scored seven more goals than he should have done, with Cunha ranking third in the same category.",
      "Cunha and Mbeumo could therefore bring that clinical edge that United are missing. But would they go straight into the team - and if so, where?",
      "Amorim has repeatedly said he will not deviate from his way of playing via the 3-4-2-1 formation. The plus point for Cunha is that Vitor Pereira used the same system at Wolves in the second half of last season.",
      "Cunha turned out in the 'left No 10' role in Pereira's system and while the forward's 15-goal league season saw him strike consistently across the campaign, it arguably hit top gear under Pereira.",
      "Cunha scored in Pereira's first two matches in charge from that position, while he then hit five goals across seven straight games between the start of February and April.",
      "The issue with Cunha playing that role in United colours? Bruno Fernandes. He is the most common appearance maker in that 'left 10' role since Amorim took charge.",
      "The United captain ended the season a little bit deeper, actually playing as one of the two sitting midfielders, with Mason Mount taking that 'No 10' role ahead of him. It was that same set-up when United lost the Europa League final to Spurs.",
      "But is it so simple that Fernandes will settle for the deeper role and Cunha sits in front of him? Firstly, there are doubts about the balance of United's team, but there is a heavier dilemma at play.",
      "At Sporting, that same No 10 role belonged to Pedro Goncalves, also known as Pote. He was not necessarily the star of the team but very much the attacking engine of it.",
      "While players like Viktor Gyokeres took the headlines, Pote engineered a lot of the attacking combinations - he got 30 goals and 27 assists during the final 73 league games of Amorim's Sporting era.",
      "So that pocket of attacking space often belongs to the important cog of Amorim's team. The United head coach will need to determine whether that position at Old Trafford belongs to Fernandes or Cunha.",
      "Like Cunha, Mbeumo will be looking to turn his upward trajectory into some early form at Old Trafford.",
      "Only Mohamed Salah won more points for his team from goals and assists than the Brentford forward. His goal contributions didn't just put him among the league's best in terms of numbers, but also as one of the division's best at deciding games when it matters.",
      "While Cunha is eyeing up that 'left No 10' role, Mbeumo will be targeting the spot on the right. Going back to his Sporting days, Amorim's system always had a right-footed natural winger playing in that role - with Marcus Edwards and Francisco Trincao among those options in Lisbon.",
      "At United, Mbeumo will want that position - but so will Amad Diallo. The 23-year-old has spent most of the Amorim era at United on the injury table but has briefly shown glimpses of being the shining light in this dark period for the club.",
      "His goal and assist to win the Manchester derby at rivals City came from that 'Right No 10' position, as did his start in the Europa League final defeat, where he looked like the only player capable of breaking the deadlock against the Spurs defence.",
      "So, two things could happen if Mbeumo completes his Old Trafford move. Either the load on young prodigy Amad is lessened and the two compete for the same role. Or Amad is shifted to right wing-back.",
      "In Amorim's United system, the wing-backs appear to be the most scrutinised area of the pitch, alongside the No 10s - but the pursuits of Cunha and Mbeumo are addressing the latter.",
      "United's inability to have recognised options in at wing-back was symbolised by the early acquisition of Patrick Dorgu in January, who may not be the finished article but at least brought in a profile that United lacked.",
      "In an era where transitions from one pitch to the other and open spaces in wide areas are pretty common, efficient wing-backs are vital in any system like Amorim's.",
      "That has not just been evident in Pereira's 3-4-2-1 system at Wolves, but also at Oliver Glasner's Crystal Palace side. The industrious running of Daniel Munoz and Tyrick Mitchell was a key feature in the Eagles winning the FA Cup and reaching Europe, a level that United would even take right now.",
      "Meanwhile United's wing-back options, despite having a lot of running to do, are not among the league's elite runners, with Amorim once citing a \"lack of urgency to defend or attack the box\" as a contributor to defeats.",
      "But Amad has shown he can operate in that wing-back role. Amorim's first four Premier League games at United saw the youngster start in that position - he got four assists in that run. After a period further forward, his next start at wing-back ended in a late hat-trick against Southampton.",
      "And in another throwback to Sporting, Amorim even played then-17-year-old Geovany Quenda in that right wing-back role during his final few months at Lisbon, highlighting how he can give huge running responsibility to young and attack-minded shoulders.",
      "Cunha and Mbeumo's arrivals - one finalised and the other being plotted - are the first steps in United's blueprints in the bid to bounce back. They promise not only to change those two players' lives - but the responsibilities of those around them.",
      "Part of the reasoning for United going so many games without a goal was a lack of presence in the centre forward position.",
      "Rasmus Hojlund ended the season with the fewest shots and second-fewest Expected Goals per 90 out of any recognised forward in the Premier League last season. He also had 14 starts that failed to include a shot, while Amorim feels back-up Joshua Zirkzee is better off as a No 10 option.",
      "Both Cunha and Mbeumo share the same status when it comes to being a centre forward. They can do it if needed, but it's not their strong suit.",
      "Wolves boss Pereira even confessed Cunha was not a striker last season, when he was forced to play in that role in moments when Jorgen Strand Larsen was struggling with fitness.",
      "Mbeumo - meanwhile - has played centrally before for Brentford and Thomas Frank has highlighted the Cameroon international's hold-up play as one of his strong suits.",
      "But his forward's striker outings mainly came in a 3-5-2 set-up where he would work off Ivan Toney or Yoane Wissa, rather than be a focal point himself.",
      "United's pursuit of Liam Delap - who eventually chose Chelsea - demonstrated Amorim's desire to improve the centre forward area. Viktor Gyokeres' representatives were contacted about a potential move, but he is set to join Arsenal. Nicolas Jackson, Ollie Watkins and Benjamin Sesko are the other situations United are monitoring.",
      "While United have got off to a good start in the window, there is still work to do.",

      "Barcelona make Marcus Rashford their top left-wing target, according to Sky in Germany;  Barca are \"prepared to go all-in\" for the Manchester United forward; interest comes after Liverpool rejected Barca's advances for Luis Diaz, and Nico Williams' new deal at Athletic Club",

      "Friday 11 July 2025 19:41, UK",
      "Manchester United forward Marcus Rashford is now Barcelona's clear left-wing target, according to Sky in Germany.",
      "Barca are expected to try and agree a deal and are \"prepared to go all-in\".",
      "This is because Liverpool have rejected their advances for Luis Diaz, and Nico Williams has signed a new deal at Athletic Club.",
      "The forward has returned to Carrington despite being offered extra time off and is training away from the first team, using the medical and rehab facilities.",
      "The 27-year-old is among five Man Utd players who can explore a potential move away after expressing a desire to leave.",
      "Matheus Cunha has taken the No 10 shirt from Rashford, who said he wanted a \"new challenge\" before joining Aston Villa for the second half of last season.",
      "There have been no official offers for Rashford after he returned from his loan at Villa.",
      "Barcelona remains Rashford's preferred destination should he leave United this summer.",
      "And, intriguingly, the door could be opening on a move to Catalonia.",
      "That's because in the past week, Barcelona have seen their hopes of landing either Liverpool's Diaz or Athletic Club's Nico Williams more or less extinguished.",
      "Financial issues remain a concern at Barcelona. They have tight financial parameters set by LaLiga and a recent history of failing to register players due to problems around funding those deals.",
      "Rashford's prospects of a switch to Barcelona look more likely now than they did two weeks ago - but how a deal will be structured will take some work given Barcelona's financial issues, Rashford's wages at Manchester United, and the Old Trafford club's preference to sell rather than sanction another loan.",
      "Read here for a 360 look at Rashford's future.",
