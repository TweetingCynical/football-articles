      "Manchester United have been told why Bruno Fernandes being in their squad next season is unlikely if they pursue a deal for Cole Palmer. United have been linked with the signing for the Chelsea talent in recent weeks, whilst Fernandes' prospects at Old Trafford have also been mentioned on the rumour mill.",
      "Palmer left Manchester City in 2023 to join Chelsea, but was a United supporter in his youth, which has sparked rumours that a switch to the Red Devils might materialise this summer.",
      "Fernandes was strongly linked with a transfer to the Saudi Pro League last summer, but chose to stay at United for another campaign, and the rumours of a possible exit in future persist.",
      "The Portugal international has a deal at United running until summer 2027, with the Red Devils holding the option to extend the contract by an additional 12 months.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UTD FB PAGE! Latest United news and more on our dedicated Facebook page",
      "“I think it all depends on what happens with Bruno Fernandes,” Pennant stated, speaking on behalf of BetSelect.co.uk.",
      "“He's obviously not getting any younger. If the Saudi clubs come back in for a whopping £100 million plus, I think they may potentially think, 'Okay, thank you and bring in Cole [Palmer]'.",
      "“But I don't see why they'd bring in Cole and then have Bruno as well, both kind of the same position. Unless they're looking to drop Bruno a bit deeper.",
      "Cole Palmer was linked with a move to Manchester United(Image: Photo by Giuseppe Maffia/NurPhoto via Getty Images)",
      "“But if you've got a player of that calibre saying, ‘I'm unhappy and I want to come to your club or come back home’, the alarm bells are going to start ringing and maybe having questions about it because he's a fantastic player.",
      "“I would be surprised [if Palmer left] because I think Chelsea have kind of built a project, a lot of young players, for the past two seasons, been evolved around Cole Palmer.",
      "“You would say that, obviously not in the league position at the minute, but maybe they're in a better place at present. So yeah, it would be a shock to see him leave to go to Man United.”",

      "Cristiano Ronaldo 'liked' Jose Mourinho's comments about him and Lionel Messi(Image: Yasser Bakhsh/Getty Images)",
      "Cristiano Ronaldo has liked an Instagram post of Jose Mourinho arguing in favour of the Manchester United legend over Lionel Messi. Since breaking through as two of the world’s most exhilarating talents in the mid-noughties, the football world has been divided into those who prefer Messi and those who believe Ronaldo to be better.",
      "Their rivalry was at its peak after Ronaldo left United for Real Madrid in 2009 and Messi still played for Barcelona. The pair were the standout stars of their respective clubs and regularly competed against each other for La Liga titles, golden boot awards and Ballon d’Or prizes, with the Portuguese claiming five while his Argentine rival Messi clinched a record eight.",
      "Today, they are considered well past their primes but Ronaldo, aged 40, is on his way to 1,000 career goals at Al-Nassr in Saudi Arabia, though he is currently on strike. Meanwhile, Messi, 38, won the MLS Cup last year with Inter Miami.",
      "Even so, their respective fan bases still continue the eternal debate over which is actually football’s ‘greatest player of all time’. While Messi usually steers clear of such comparisons, Ronaldo appears more determined to cement his own legacy with his comments in interviews.",
      "The Portuguese forward has seemingly now sought to do so once more by liking an old video on social media of his compatriot Mourinho championing him at the expense of the Barcelona legend, while he still managed Ronaldo at Real Madrid. In the clip from 2012, Mourinho explains why it is more difficult to be Ronaldo.",
      "He says: \"I still say that it is more difficult to be Cristiano than Messi. Messi grew up in the team he plays for, with the team-mates he plays with. Cristiano arrived in England at a giant team in crisis, which was only losing. He had to grow over the last two years with this team under construction.",
      "\"Messi plays as a number 9 in about 50 square meters, closer to the goal and with less defensive work. Cristiano, on the other hand, is a winger. How can a winger score the same number of goals as a centre forward?",
      "Mourinho coached and defended Ronaldo at Real Madrid(Image: AFP via Getty Images)",
      "\"A winger who defends, who ends a game in the 94th minute running after Pedro in a goal-scoring situation. A winger who, in set pieces, reaches his own area 20 times because he is very important to the defence. A player who is not protected by anything or anyone... It is much, much harder to be Cristiano, let's stop joking.\"",
      "Despite his obvious stance at the time, which may have stemmed from a certain amount of bias given his club and international affiliations, Mourinho has more recently refused to compare the two global superstars.",
      "In fact, in a move that would likely frustrate the ultra-competitive Ronaldo, he claimed in 2025 that neither player at their peak matched the skill and pure ability of the Brazilian Ronaldo, who played for both Barcelona and Madrid beforehand.",
      "Lionel Messi has more Ballon d'Or wins to his name(Image: Getty Images)",
      "Mourinho said: \"Ronaldo, El Fenomeno. Cristiano Ronaldo and Leo Messi have had longer careers, they have remained at the top every day for 15 years.",
      "\"However, if we are talking strictly about talent and skill, nobody surpasses Ronaldo. Injuries killed a career that could have been even more incredible, but the talent that that 19-year-old boy had was something incredible.\"",
      "Meanwhile, the Al-Nassr captain doubled down last year in his interview with Piers Morgan that he is a better footballer than Messi. He said: \"Is Messi better than me? I disagree. I don't want to be humble.\"",

      "Football matches are being won in deserved but dramatic fashion. Supporters are off their seats, including those sat in the posh ones in the directors box.",
      "Fergie himself couldn't keep the smile off his face, when he watched United produce a win over Fulham that was from his very own vintage. Conceding an equaliser in stoppage time. Only to charge down the opposite end and snatch a winner.",
      "For Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and Ruud Van Nistelrooy, read Benjamin Sesko. For the second time in a week, United won a game instead of settling for a point.",
      "Carrick has shown in his substitutions he is proactive instead of reactive. He sent on Sesko with his side 2-0 up. It's the sort of attitude Fergie himself used to have.",
      "It sums up the parody of a place United has become, that an afternoon which started with a huge protest against the club's owners, ended in thrilling jubilation.",

But three straight victories since taking charge have left him in serious danger of getting the job permanently in the summer. And anyone who can get Sesko scoring world class winning goals, has to be some sort of managerial genius.",

      "Tyrell Malacia is thought to be fuming with Manchester United after Jason Wilcox blocked a deadline day move away from Old Trafford. The 26-year-old has been overlooked with the Red Devils this season, with just one Premier League appearance to his name for 2025/26.",
      "As a result, speculation has been rife this month that the left-back could be on the move in the winter transfer window. While it is thought that Malacia was set to make his way to Turkey on Monday for a medical, insiders claim that he received a call from Wilcox just before boarding his flight to tell him that he would remain with his current club.",
      "The Dutch defender could also find himself a part of Michael Carrick's plans for the rest of the season, given United's stance on deploying him may have changed as a result of Patrick Dorgu's recent injury. Dorgu picked up an issue during United's 3-2 win over Arsenal last month, with reports suggesting he could be out of action for up to 10 weeks.",
      "While Carrick was recently unable to put a timeline on Dorgu's recovery, the interim head coach has conceded that he faces a spell away from playing. He said in a press conference: \"Pat, unfortunately, is going to be out for a period of time. We are still working through how long that is going to be.\"",
      "Retaining Malacia could be a move which proves problematic in a matter of months, given his current deal with the club expires this summer. As a result, he will be able to leave on a free should relationships fail to be mended.",
      "It comes as Malacia was included in a five-man 'bomb-squad' under Ruben Amorim prior to his sacking in January, alongside Alejandro Garnacho, Marcus Rashford, Antony and Jadon Sancho. He was also the only player who failed to secure a move away from the club last summer.",
      "Jason Wilcox is reported to have blocked a deal for Tyrell Malacia(Image: Getty Images)",
      "Rashford is currently thriving on a season-long loan spell with Barcelona, while Sancho is enjoying a similar scenario with Aston Villa. Garnacho, meanwhile, secured a permanent transfer to Chelsea to the tune of £40million, while Antony joined Real Betis for up to £21.65m.",
      "It seems as though Carrick is happy to put his faith in his current crop of players for the second-half of 2025/26, with very little in terms of activity in the current transfer window - which slams shut at 7pm. The 44-year-old has been a breath of fresh air in his first three games at the helm of the Red Devils - overseeing a 2-0 win over Manchester City, a 3-2 win over Arsenal, and a 3-2 win over Fulham.",
      "However, speculation regarding his future at Old Trafford beyond 2025/26 remains. Given he is only on an interim deal until the summer, United have no obligation to keep him on, regardless of his performances this term.",

      "Instead, they could opt to put their faith in a more seasoned head coach when they reassess their options in a matter of months, with Oliver Glasner, Roberto De Zerbi and Thomas Tuchel seeing their names brought up in conversation as of late.",

      "Manchester United's improvement under Michael Carrick has meant a quiet January transfer window(Image: Neal Simpson/Sportsphoto/Allstar via Getty Images)",
      "Manchester United are sending James Scanlon on loan to Swindon Town for the remainder of the season. United have already secured multiple exits for youngsters in an otherwise quiet January transfer window and Scanlon is set to be the next player to leave.",
      "The 19-year-old winger has got the green light to join Swindon’s push for promotion from League Two under manager Ian Holloway. Town sit sixth in the table, three points off the automatic promotion positions, and are keen to add attacking threat.",
      "Scanlon already has 20 caps and two goals for Gibraltar to his name and is ready for senior football, having been a regular for United’s academy sides. The winger has eight goals and five assists in 47 games for the under-21s, having been prolific for the under-18s after joining from Derby County in 2021.",
      "United’s connection to the academy has been strengthened in the past month following the departure of Ruben Amorim. Michael Carrick has been appointed as interim boss until the end of the campaign, with under-21s boss Travis Binnion among his coaching staff.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UTD FB PAGE! Latest United news and more on our dedicated Facebook page",
      "Scanlon is yet to make an appearance for the United first team and is behind the likes of Shea Lacey in the pecking order. The winger’s brother, Luca Scanlon, is a midfielder and was also previously in the United academy before leaving for Burnley last year.",
      "United have had a quiet January transfer window, having splashed over £200million to sign Bryan Mbeumo, Matheus Cunha and Benjamin Sesko in the summer. The departure of Amorim – and the immediate improvement under Carrick – has prompted the hierarchy to hold fire on deals until the summer, when a long-term managerial appointment will be made.",
      "Instead, the club has prioritised exits of young players. Toby Collyer has been sent on loan to Hull City and Harry Amass to Norwich following previous loans at West Brom and Sheffield Wednesday respectively.",
      "James Scanlon is leaving Manchester United on loan(Image: Manchester United via Getty Images)",
      "Meanwhile, Rhys Bennett was sold to Fleetwood Town, Joe Hugill departed permanently for Kilmarnock and Sam Mather terminated his contract in order to join Turkish side Kayserispor on a free transfer.",
      "Carrick had left the door open for further deals when asked ahead of the 3-2 win over Fulham on Sunday. “Never say never. A lot can happen and situations can be thrown up,” he said. “Sometimes it is in our control, sometimes not. I am pretty calm. We have shown what we are capable of as a team.”",
      "He was also asked about the future of captain Bruno Fernandes. “We all want to win things. We all want to get better. We want to improve as a team,” Carrick added. “We want to be successful and that's something we've got to work towards together, but Bruno's been fantastic since I've been here. He was fantastic when I was here before, so I've got nothing but good things to say about him.",
      "“That's not to get too far ahead, you know. That's [his future] on the agenda a little bit, but my main agenda is getting through the game on Sunday with Fulham. Bruno's fully committed. There's absolutely no issues at all with that. Things further down the line [will be] addressed towards the end of the season or whatever. But now everything's positive at the moment.”",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Liverpool transfer target Jeremy Jacquet has demonstrated the mentality that Anfield chiefs will be acquiring should they seal a deadline-day swoop for the defender. The Rennes star is edging closer to a late switch to Merseyside, with the Reds aiming to finalise a deal before the 7pm cut-off point before sending him back to the French top-flight outfit on loan for the rest of the campaign.",
      "The club have fended off interest from rivals including Chelsea and Manchester United and struck an initial £55million agreement with Rennes plus £5million in performance-related bonuses. Jacquet is understood to have been won over by the vision presented by Liverpool, with reports suggesting that he believes he will secure more opportunities at Anfield.",
      "If accurate, this wouldn't be the first occasion in his fledgling career that Jacquet has made playing time his priority. The youngster stepped down a division to join Ligue 2 outfit Clemert on loan in January 2024.",
      "Speaking to L'Equipe, via Ligue 1 last year, Jacquet discussed that choice. \"It was either stay at Rennes with little playing time or go and discover something new,\" he said.",
      "\"I chose minutes on the pitch - and it paid off.\"",
      "He was brought back in February last year, having racked up 24 appearances for the club. The 20-year-old has subsequently cemented himself as a first-team regular at Rennes, ahead of his anticipated deadline day transfer to Liverpool.",
      "\"When you're young, the most important thing is to play,\" he added regarding his loan decision. \"That came from me and my family. I didn't hesitate.",
      "\"It shows I'm confident in myself and ready to make sacrifices to reach my goals.\"",

      "He attributes his success so far to the values instilled in him by his family. \"I inherited respect and humility from them,\" he said.",
      "\"With that, it's impossible for me to act like someone who doesn't want to work.\"",
      "Jacquet has also given Liverpool fans a taste of what they can expect from him on the pitch. \"I'm calm on the ball, maybe I can look a bit nonchalant - but I'm focused,\" he explained.",
      "\"What defines me is playing out well, breaking lines with the right pass.\"",
      "He further added: \"The coach asks me to communicate more, to lead, to add a bit more aggression. I'm working on finding the right balance.\"",
      "If the transfer goes through, it will bolster Arne Slot's defensive choices for the latter half of the season. Currently, Ibrahima Konate and Virgil van Dijk are the only fit first team centre-backs available.",

      "Liverpool broke a transfer record in the January window for a former Manchester United target(Image: Liverpool FC, Liverpool FC via Getty Images)",
      "For Liverpool supporters, there are few sweeter moments than getting the better of Manchester United. Throughout the last decade, the pendulum in English football's fiercest rivalry has swung decisively in Liverpool's favour, with Virgil van Dijk's towering influence playing a major role.",
      "The Dutch centre-back joined from Southampton in January 2018 for a club-record £75million - then a world-record sum for a defender - and proceeded to revolutionise the team's defence. Yet astonishingly, he had come close to moving to Old Trafford just months before.",
      "His former Southampton colleague Charlie Austin revealed that Van Dijk was in serious discussions with United during the summer of 2017. However, the Red Devils opted for Victor Lindelof instead, a choice that allowed Liverpool to swoop in.",
      "FOLLOW OUR LIVERPOOL FB PAGE! Latest Reds news and more on our dedicated Facebook page",
      "Recalling a conversation with Van Dijk during his days at Southampton, Austin told talkSPORT in 2022: \"I remember at the back end of his Southampton career, we were sitting on the bench together at Chelsea away. I said to him, 'Come on Virgil, what's going on, surely Manchester United must have been in for you? They're a massive club in England.'",
      "\"He said, 'Do you know what Chaz, in the summer it was between me and Lindelof - and they went for Lindelof.' Nobody knows that. He told me on the bench and I couldn't believe it. I was gobsmacked.\"",
      "It is a decision that has tormented United in ways the club could barely have envisioned. Not only has Van Dijk flourished spectacularly on Merseyside but he is considered one of the greatest defenders of his era.",
      "Lindelof, in contrast, never quite fulfilled his potential during his eight-year stint at Old Trafford. The Sweden international was consistent but didn't deliver the same commanding presence and defensive solidity as Van Dijk has for Liverpool.",
      "Manchester United opted to sign Victor Lindelof in 2017(Image: Ash Donelon, Manchester United via Getty Images)",
      "Following their regret of not splashing out on Van Dijk, United proceeded to smash the transfer record for a defender by signing Harry Maguire from Leicester City in 2019. Yet Maguire also failed to match the Liverpool skipper for consistency.",
      "His performances swung dramatically, oscillating from reliable to catastrophic and being branded an expensive transfer mistake. Still at the club, the England international has since rediscovered his footing and partly restored a previously damaged reputation, though he is not held in the same esteem as his Liverpool counterpart.",
      "Van Dijk captained Liverpool to the Premier League title last season(Image: PAUL ELLIS, AFP via Getty Images)",
      "Van Dijk, meanwhile, has solidly cemented himself as one of Liverpool's finest ever players. He was instrumental in the club's 2018/19 Champions League and 2019/20 Premier League victories and became just the third defender in history to be crowned PFA Player of the Year in 2019.",
      "He also came second in the Ballon d'Or in 2019 and has clocked up well over 300 appearances for the club. He was named club captain in 2023 after Jordan Henderson's departure, guiding the club to a second Premier League title last term.",

The forward also featured for just ten minutes in United's victory over Arsenal after coming on for the injured Patrick Dorgu.",

      "Manchester United made a last-ditch attempt to hijack Jeremy Jacquet's transfer to Liverpool. News emerged late on Sunday night that the Reds had agreed a deal with Rennes to sign the centre-back this summer.",
      "The reigning Premier League champions have negotiated a pre-agreement worth an initial £55million plus £5m in add-ons for the 20-year-old, having held talks with the French side over the weekend. But according to journalist Florian Plettenberg, United tried to hijack the transfer on Sunday evening but were unsuccessful, as the defender already had an agreement in place with Liverpool.",
      "Chelsea had approached Stade Rennais earlier in January about a deal for Jacquet, but the French club were reluctant to sanction a departure midway through the campaign. That meant that Jacquet had a choice between Chelsea and Liverpool for whom he wanted to join in the summer, and he opted for the latter because he believes there is a better chance of regular first-team football at Anfield.",
      "Jacquet's move to Liverpool comes amid uncertainty around the future of Ibrahima Konate. The Frenchman is out of contract in the summer and is being linked with a move to Real Madrid.",
      "United, meanwhile, are set for a quiet end to the January transfer window, with their deadline day activity set to focus on securing exits for some of their academy graduates. Providing an update on Friday, Michael Carrick said: \"To be honest, I think we're just working through it. Never say never, of course, because a lot can happen and situations can be thrown up.",

      "But just moments later, United were celebrating again as substitute Sesko rifled the ball beyond Bernd Leno. Speaking after the game, Carrick said: \"There's a lot that went on today in the game. I was well aware of what a good team Fulham are going into the game.",

      "Michael Carrick is braced for a climactic January transfer deadline day at Manchester United(Image: Ash Donelon, Manchester United via Getty Images)",
      "The January transfer window draws to a close on Monday evening and Manchester United continue to be associated with several 11th-hour deals. Interim manager Michael Carrick isn't anticipated to be particularly active during the final stages of the winter market, though there are a handful of rumoured moves with possibilities.",
      "All of this month's activity at Old Trafford thus far has involved departures. Nevertheless, with the side beginning to flourish under Carrick's stewardship, this could be the moment to strengthen the squad in a bid to capitalise on that positive momentum.",
      "One significant development that occurred earlier this month was the announcement that Casemiro will depart the club when this season concludes. While that separation won't happen until the summer, it might be sensible to begin preparations now.",
      "As previously mentioned, this month has predominantly focused on exits from a United standpoint. Five in total, with a collection of emerging talents departing, either permanently or via loan arrangements.",
      "Most recently, defender Rhys Bennett has been sold to Fleetwood Town, whilst striker Joe Hugill has also departed permanently after signing for Kilmarnock. Earlier in January, Sam Mather concluded his lengthy spell with the club and was permitted to terminate his contract in order to join Turkish outfit Kayserispor on a free transfer.",
      "Regarding temporary departures, Toby Collyer has been sent out on loan again and joined Hull City after his brief stint at West Brom was cut short. This follows left-back Harry Amass's earlier departure this month to Norwich City on loan, with a few more similar deals potentially in the pipeline today.",
      "Given the advanced stage of the January window, most prospective deals will carry an element of improbability. Nevertheless, United remain among that select group of clubs that cannot be discounted from pulling off something remarkable before the deadline.",
      "A pursuit of Barcelona midfielder Marc Casado would represent precisely that. The 22-year-old defensive midfielder has been linked with a switch to Old Trafford this month and is allegedly also on the radar of Spanish rivals Atletico Madrid.",
      "Marc Casado has been repeatedly linked with a move to Manchester this month(Image: Quality Sport Images, Getty Images)",
      "Casado has previously been praised as one of the more outstanding prospects to emerge from La Masia in recent seasons. But while he's been a regular feature in Hansi Flick's midfield setup this campaign, he potentially lacks the guaranteed starting role he desires at the Camp Nou.",
      "With Casemiro poised to leave, it won't be long before United lose the most dependable figure they have at the heart of midfield. Casado would represent the opposite end of the scale given he's still in the formative phase of his career, though acquiring him would enable United to allocate a significant portion of salary funds to other areas of the squad.",
      "Casado remains under contract in Catalonia until summer 2028 and it's been suggested his agreement contains a buyout clause valued at approximately £87million. A deadline day transfer would remain expensive considering Barca won't be enthusiastic about offloading anyone without the opportunity to secure a replacement, though Marcus Rashford could provide assistance if that's a transaction Barca would wish to finalise.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "Another prospective target to address that void in midfield is ex-Wolves playmaker Ruben Neves. The Portuguese star has been linked with a Premier League comeback this month following several seasons in Saudi Arabia, and United require someone fitting his specification.",
      "Newcastle have been cited as the alternative destination for the midfielder after suggestions Neves appeared poised to depart Al-Hilal. Yet it has subsequently transpired he now seems destined to pen a fresh contract in Riyadh.",
      "United target Ruben Neves looks set to sign a new deal at Al-Hilal(Image: Getty Images)",
      "According to reports, Neves is in the final phases of agreeing a handsome, new three-year deal with the defending Saudi Pro League champions. This would extinguish any hope United might have harboured in their pursuit of the midfielder.",
      "In numerous respects, Neves could have represented Carrick's perfect midfield reinforcement, whether this month or during the summer. He remains within the appropriate age bracket as he approaches his 29th birthday, possesses considerable expertise in English football and corresponds closely with what United seek in a deep-lying midfielder.",
      "The opportunity isn't completely closed just yet, and United might still be capable of proposing terms that would entice both him and Al-Hilal towards an agreement. Presently, however, it appears one of the club's finest chances in the January window has largely evaporated.",

      "Michael Carrick and his wife Lisa have been subject to comments from Roy Keane(Image: Photo by Anthony Devlin/Getty Images)",
      "Roy Keane has never shied away from voicing his opinions on Michael Carrick - or his wife for that matter. The 44-year-old was named Manchester United interim head coach earlier this month after Ruben Amorim's dismissal.",
      "It's been a remarkable beginning for the former England midfielder, who secured impressive wins against Manchester City and Arsenal in his opening two matches at the helm. Whilst some have suggested that Carrick's swift and positive influence on the team could put him in contention for the permanent role should the strong results persist, Keane hasn't joined that particular camp.",
      "The former United skipper controversially declared following the 3-2 triumph over Arsenal that he wouldn't hand Carrick the permanent position even if he won the remaining 15 fixtures of the campaign.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UTD FB PAGE! Latest United news and more on our dedicated Facebook page",
      "\"Even if they do get into fourth, I still wouldn't be convinced he's the man for the job. Absolutely not. They need a bigger and better manager. But he has got the opportunity and what a chance for him, and you know what, he's taking it.\"",
      "Despite his earlier comments casting doubt on Carrick's credentials for the permanent role, he appears to have backtracked on those previous statements and now insists he wants him to land the position.",
      "Speaking on The Overlap's Stick to Football podcast earlier this week, Keane admitted: \"I hope they give it [the permanent job] to him. I hope they give it to him in the summer.\"",
      "However, he clarified that whilst he hopes Carrick gets the promotion, he believes it would be the wrong call from the United hierarchy. Speaking to Gary Neville, Keane added: \"I don't think it's the right decision, good luck with it.",
      "\"Yeah, but, I'm sticking to my guns. I've said my piece, I think that he's got the job, and if he gets it in the summer then you go 'listen, good luck to him', but as a caretaker manager, it's a different animal to being manager of United trying to win league titles over the next two, three, four, five years, whatever it might be.",
      "\"I think you can get a better manager than Carrick, absolutely. But I think he's doing a good job, perfect timing for him, and even if he doesn't get the United job, these results a bit like Ruud [Van Nistelrooy], he can get another job, probably another Premiership manager.\"",
      "Michael Carrick has enjoyed a superb start to life at Old Trafford(Image: Getty)",
      "It wasn't only Carrick who came under fire from Keane's remarks, but his wife Lisa as well, who became the target of a barb from the Republic of Ireland legend. The 54-year-old accused Lisa of having a \"big mouth\", saying: \"His wife can always come in [if Carrick doesn't do well], cause she's got a bit of a big mouth sometimes. She's probably doing the team talk.\"",
      "The remarks reignited a long-standing row between the two dating back to 2014, when Keane had directed his criticism towards Carrick. Following United's 2-0 loss to Olympiacos, Carrick gave an interview which Keane subsequently tore apart on television.",
      "The pundit said: \"That interview was just like the performance, flat. He should say a bit more, have a bit more urgency, even in the interview.\" Lisa didn't respond well to Keane's comments, taking to Twitter, now X, to write: \"Roy Keane what a ****, says anything to provoke a reaction.\"",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "She subsequently expressed remorse for her message by removing it and added: \"Deleted my tweet... Emotions got the better of me.\" Carrick himself has also been vocal about Keane's judgements, maintaining that he 'isn't bothered' by what Keane and other ex-United players turned pundits have to say.",
      "\"They're not putting more pressure on me,\" Carrick said ahead of the Manchester derby. \"I don't feel that. There are plenty of opinions around, some positive, some not too much. It's totally irrelevant in terms of what I focus on.",
      "\"There's a lot that can be said, it's the way of the world. I'm not going to pay too much attention to that. For me, the players and staff, we focus on how we're going to succeed.\" When questioned directly about Keane, Carrick added: \"It didn't bother me.\"",

      "Carlos Baleba has previously revealed his stance on a potential switch to Manchester United. The Brighton midfielder has been on the club's radar since last summer.",
      "In a bid to back Ruben Amorim, United splashed out more than £200million during the previous transfer window, bringing in three high-profile signings: Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko. Senne Lammens also joined as the new number one goalkeeper.",
      "Despite these reinforcements, Amorim couldn't hold onto his position and was dismissed after approximately 14 months at the helm, with Michael Carrick taking over. On the topic of exits, it has been confirmed that Casemiro will leave the club when this season concludes.",
      "The Brazilian's departure will leave a significant void in the centre of the park, making a replacement an obvious priority. United were strongly linked with Brighton's Baleba during the summer and whether through a surprise late deadline day swoop or a summer acquisition, the 22-year-old has already made his feelings about joining United abundantly clear.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UTD FB PAGE! Latest United news and more on our dedicated Facebook page",
      "During last summer's window, United reportedly initiated preliminary discussions with Brighton regarding Baleba, but the Seagulls were said to have demanded a staggering £115million fee. This put United off making a serious move for Baleba, though numerous reports indicate he remains firmly on their list of targets.",
      "Some sources even suggest that this month, the club explored the possibility of a January switch, although any deal is more likely to materialise in the summer.",
      "The 22-year-old has been on United's radar since the summer(Image: Getty)",
      "\"I don't really think like that: playing for two or three years and then leaving. Me? I just work. In my head it's all about working and helping my club,\" Baleba explained.",
      "\"If I can help a team-mate, I will. If they can help me, I'll accept that help to push forward and develop. So, I just work to help my team and myself progress in the future.",
      "\"In return, everyone who helps me wants me to go to the highest level. And if there are big clubs who want me, it's not something that worries me or gets me excited.",

      "\"Everyone talking about you, singing your name? That just doesn't do it for me. It's not something that gets me running. I just prefer getting my head down and working on the pitch.\"",
      "Whilst this mindset doesn't necessarily aid United's pursuit of the determined Baleba, such characteristics are commendable and would only intensify their ambition to secure the Cameroonian's signature either now or in the coming months.",

      "“But I don't see why they'd bring in Cole and then have Bruno as well, both kind of the same position. Unless they're looking to drop Bruno a bit deeper.",
      "“But if you've got a player of that calibre saying, ‘I'm unhappy and I want to come to your club or come back home’, the alarm bells are going to start ringing and maybe having questions about it because he's a fantastic player.",
      "Still no confirmation for Jacob Devaney's move to St Mirren. Clubs in Scotland do have until 11pm, however, so it could be a while yet.",

      "You can't accuse Manchester United of not being true to their word. For a couple of weeks, we've been told not to expect anything major to happen at Old Trafford, and that proved to be an accurate summary of events.",
      "The most exciting thing to happen in this window came in December, with the attempt to sign Antoine Semenyo in December. United stuck that £65million back in the safe when he opted for Manchester City and it hasn't been seen since. Semenyo fit United's January plan of only moving for a player who was a long-term target.",
      "Some might see the failure to secure a higher-quality backup for Casemiro as a risk, but the schedule isn't that demanding, and hopefully, the 33-year-old can continue to roll back the years. He will take some replacing in the summer.",
      "All eyes now turn to that window. Casemiro is going, Tyrell Malacia is going, Harry Maguire could go, Manuel Ugarte and Joshua Zirkzee are likely to go. It will be a busy summer at Old Trafford, but it was certainly a quiet January.",
      "10 exits for United this month and you can see them all here.",

      "United have been keen to keep hold of Zirkzee and Carrick insisted he was happy to have him in the squad again following an injury. TalkSPORT understands the Dutchman is also keen to stay at Old Trafford now having been enthused by the turnaround under the interim head coach. He is believed to be keen to fight for his place in the squad.",
      "League One Rotherham have agreed a loan deal for United youngster Gabriele Biancheri, according to journalist Pete O'Rourke. The 19-year-old joined from Cardiff City in 2023. Biancheri has scored eight goals in 21 appearances for United's academy so far this season.",
      "According to Sky Sport Italia, Palace striker Jean-Philippe Mateta has failed his medical with AC Milan in Paris this afternoon. As such, the move to the San Siro is off. United have been linked with the Frenchman previously but it was not expected they would move for him in the January transfer window.",
      "With United welcoming back plenty of defenders recently, it was expected Tyler Fredricson would be sent out on loan to gain more exposure to senior football. However, an injury has scuppered all hopes of that. BBC Sport understands Celtic, Aberdeen and Huddersfield Town were all linked with signing the centre-back. The 20-year-old has made four senior appearances for the Reds and has not yet had a loan spell away from the club.",
      "According to reports, including from BBC Sport, former United midfielder Angel Gomes is expected to return to the Premier League on deadline day. Struggling Wolves are believed to be closing in on a loan deal for the United academy graduate. Gomes has scored four goals in 20 appearances for Marseille this season but has only played eight minutes for the French club since December.",
      "Since Michael Carrick’s return to Manchester United, Old Trafford has resembled the fortress of yesteryear. But it is not just the Theatre of Dreams enjoying an Indian Summer. Before the victory over Arsenal, Casemiro announced he would not be signing a contract extension and would be leaving United at the end of the season. And so began a long goodbye for the Brazilian.",
      "He impressed at the Emirates but against Fulham on Sunday afternoon, he proved how difficult he will be to replace. For a defensive midfielder, Casemiro is not expected to be an elite header of the ball but bar Harry Maguire, he was the only man on the pitch you wanted to be on the end of a Bruno Fernandes free kick.",
      "Read more here>>>",
      "We were not expecting Malacia to leave on deadline day but him staying in Manchester will be a blow. The defender has not had many opportunities to impress since Erik ten Hag departed, with injuries and managerial decisions stuttering his progress. Missing out on a January exit means Malacia is more than likely to be without first-team football for another six months or so which is gut-wrenching for him.",
      "Malacia will leave Manchester United on a free transfer this summer after his hopes of sealing a deadline day move to Turkey were blocked by club chiefs. Malacia was ready to fly to Istanbul on Monday morning to seal a switch away from Old Trafford, having made his desire to leave the club five months before his contract expires clear. The 26-year-old was hoping a deal could be agreed between a club showing interest from Turkey's Super Lig and United, with a loan move or a permanent switch believed to be on the table.

As for Sekou Kone, there is no rush to agree a deal with Lausanne-Sport today as the Swiss window shuts in a fortnight.",
      "Middlesbrough star Hayden Hackney, who has been linked with United in recent weeks, has confirmed he does not want to leave his club on deadline day.",
      "No [I don't want to leave]. I’m really happy. The manager [Kim Hellberg] has got me playing the way I enjoy playing, getting the best out of me. So yeah, I’m really enjoying it. This is what I’ve wanted to do ever since I was a kid, play for Middlesbrough. And where we are in the league at the minute, as long as we just keep going, we feel confident.

      "A little under 20 minutes later, the roar that greeted the final whistle was one of ecstasy mixed with relief. United did their best to throw away a routine win, but having rescued themselves with Benjamin Sesko's 94th-minute winner, it arguably made for a more enjoyable afternoon.",
      "Certainly, the United fans leaving the ground will remember the day more than they would have done had the contest finished 2-0, or even 2-1, after Raul Jimenez scored an 85th-minute penalty that set the mayhem in motion.",

      "\"It's the best feeling, I have to say. Some of the best moments here that I've been lucky enough to be a part of are when you get a moment of elation and excitement like that,\" he said of Sesko's dramatic winner, which came after Fulham had equalised in the first minute of injury time.",
      "\"There's no better place, in front of the Stretford End, and it ends up meaning a bit more. I think people leave here with more than just, you know, United win today, and it kind of puts layers on top of that and the connection and the feeling, the emotion, it’s why we all love it so much and especially the supporters, so it goes a long way.",
      "\"The excitement that's part of this club, it's not always the easiest way, but certainly when they come along, it's pretty special.\"",
      "Carrick was part of plenty of wins that fit this narrative during his 464 games for the club, but it's very different doing it as a player than as a manager.",
      "When Sesko's goal hit the back of the net, the substitutes tore down the touchline to join in with the celebrations, while Senne Lammens raced from his goal into the Fulham half before retreating.",
      "But Carrick remained calm and after a brief chat with assistant Steve Holland, he tried to call back Leny Yoro from the celebrations to come on. He explained the differences between doing it as a player and a manager afterwards, revealing he always felt his team would get a chance to win the game.",
      "\"Yeah, slightly different,\" he said. \"I think when you're in the thick of it as a player, you're right in the moment and you obviously don't always see the bigger picture. You're a little bit different in terms of the attachment to the game. I was pretty calm all the way through.",
      "\"We were disappointed obviously with the second goal, but I was aware there was still eight minutes to go at that point when they scored. If anything, I was thinking there's a long time to go and we still had the players on the pitch at that point that could really make the difference for us. I was still really positive that I thought we'd find a moment.",
      "\"Listen, it's hard to hold your emotions together when the goal goes in like that, so I think we all celebrated when that went in. But, yeah, I did feel we'd have a moment. We tend to, in them type of games, you always have a moment, it's just whether you can take it, and Ben certainly did that from Bruno's great work down the right.\"",
      "It has been noticeable in Carrick's three-game reign so far that he is determined to project calm to his players. He rarely shows emotion on the sidelines, but admits it is about getting the balance right of when to let some emotion out.",
      "\"Certainly, that composure and that calmness for the players to be able to think clearly,\" said Carrick. \"It's getting the balance, and I think we've got the balance pretty well over the last three games of playing with that bit of fire and a bit of hunger, but making good decisions as well.",
      "\"I'm not sure we all made good decisions when that goal went in in terms of how we celebrated, but that's what you strive for, that's why we all love the game for moments like that, so when they do come, you're going to make the most of them.\"",

      "Manchester United celebrate as they beat Fulham 3-2 at Old Trafford(Image: James Gill - Danehouse/Getty Images)",
      "Manchester United picked up one of their trademark 'Fergie Time' three points on Sunday thanks to a dramatic late strike from Benjamin Sesko in front of the Stretford End. It is arguably the best way to win a game but, in truth, it should never have come to that vs Fulham.",
      "Casemiro's header and Matheus Cunha's strike either side of half time had put United in a strong position going into the final stages of the game. But as the game entered the final 10 minutes, the Old Trafford faithful went on a rollercoaster of emotions.",
      "With this in mind, MEN Sport has rewatched that crazy final 20 minutes back and taken a look at seven things which happened that turned United's players from heroes to zeroes and back again.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FACEBOOK PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "The warning signs of what was to come were there as we entered the final 10 minutes of normal time. United were dropping deeper looking to defend the lead they had managed to build in the previous 79 minutes by playing on the front foot. This change in style meant a new role for Bryan Mbeumo who dropped into the defensive line as Fulham looked to break United down.",
      "When United did finally get the ball back, they were lacking a focal point at the top end of the pitch. In a bid to search for the ball, Sesko was dropping deeper for the Reds. This prevented Michael Carrick's side having an outlet and allowed Fulham to restart their attacks from the back. It was relentless and was only going to end one way.",
      "Harry Maguire's challenge on Raul Jimenez was desperate as he launched himself in front of the ball to try and block the Mexican international from shooting. However, the Reds were caught out too easily moments before.",
      "Manuel Ugarte stepped out to try and win possession but did not do nearly enough and from there United were on the back foot. As the pass came through to Jimenez, Maguire could do little but chuck his body on the line to try and block the shot.",
      "Harry Maguire concedes a penalty during Manchester United's victory over Fulham",
      "With Fulham grabbing a goal back, there was plenty of tension inside Old Trafford and United did little to ease the fans' concerns. Bruno Fernandes was attempting to lead a more positive, out-of-possession tactic by pressing Fulham's defence in their own half.",
      "However, his pleas to his teammates to step up fell on deaf ears with United dropping deeper in on themselves to try and hold on. This also meant a return to a familiar formation...",
      "In United's attempt to hold onto the three points, Carrick's side moved to a back three. There were differences to the system which was ultimately Ruben Amorim's downfall though. Noussair Mazraoui replaced Diogo Dalot to play right wing-back, Maguire moved to right centre-back instead of playing down the middle and Mbeumo settled into the left wing-back role.",
      "Nine minutes were added on at the end of the second half thanks to a lengthy VAR check but Fulham needed just one of those to level things up. Unfortunately for the Reds, there were a trio of errors which led to Kevin's wonder goal.",
      "Amad and Mazraoui did not cover themselves in glory as Kevin easily jinked past the former before playing a one-two with Ryan Sessegnon which should have been cut out by the Moroccan. Then, Ugarte did not sense the danger and was too slow to close down Sessegnon as he laid it off for the winger to curl home.",
      "Kevin strikes for Fulham as they equalise vs Manchester United",
      "There was nothing Senne Lammens could do to stop the shot but plenty the three players in front of him could have.",
      "With parity restored, a switch flipped in the United side and suddenly the hosts played with the intensity which gave them the two-goal lead in the first place. It was noticeable how much further forward Kobbie Mainoo and Ugarte were as United searched for a quick response.",
      "That being said, it was still a moment of magic from Fernandes who produced a brilliant dummy to deceive Calvin Bassey and lay the ball across for Sesko to fire home the winner.",
      "The overwhelming feeling was relief but the performance in the last 20 minutes will be a warning for Carrick. The Reds cannot afford to rest on their laurels, sit in and hope to see out the game. Next time, United may not be so lucky.",

      "Ethan Wheatley is 'buzzing' to get started with Bradford after completing a loan until the end of the season. The young forward had long been expected to join the Bantams but saw the move stretch out until transfer deadline day.",
      "The England youth international made 22 appearances for the Cobblers and scored three goals and provided three assists. Wheatley has also made four appearances for United in his career and spent time on loan at Walsall last term.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FB PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "Before completing his move to Bradford, there was a moment of controversy last week when Doncaster manager Grant McCann said the club had signed Wheatley. McCann was seen as announcing another side's transfer in his press conference.",
      "But now the deal is done, Wheatley can't wait to get started. The switch sees the youngster move from a loan with a relegation candidate to a promotion hopeful",
      "Wheatley believes he developed at Northampton and wants to put what he learned into practice with the Bantams.",
      "He said, “I am buzzing. We have been in discussions for quite a while, and I am excited to get the deal done and hopefully help the lads for the rest of the season.",
      "\"I hope I can add to the side after the strong start they have made and score goals. The last couple of months at Northampton, I grew as a player, and I want to continue doing that here.\"",
      "Bradford boss Graham Alexander is equally happy and was impressed with his new signing's enthusiasm.",
      "\"We are delighted to bring Ethan in to bolster our attacking options,\" Alexander said.",
      "\"He has fantastic attributes for a forward player, with plenty of League One games under his belt this season already.",

      "The transfer window is at its end, following a quiet deadline day of transfers for Manchester City and Manchester United. Premier League clubs will have to wait until the summer to splash the cash once again to improve their squads.",
      "Pep Guardiola added two new stars to his collection in Marc Guehi and Antoine Semenyo in a bid to reinvigorate City's title push with an £84million spend. The likes of Oscar Bobb and Stefan Ortega went through the exit door to recoup some funds, while Jaden Heskey, Claudio Echeverri and Stephen Mfuni, among others, went on loan.",
      "There was an emphasis on exits at Old Trafford too. With just one competition to compete in, Michael Carrick has seen no new signings to boost his options until the end of the season.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FB PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "Sam Mather, Joe Hugill and Rhys Bennett have all made permanent exits, while figures including Harry Amass, Toby Collyer and Ethan Wheatley have gone on loan in the Football League.",
      "Both clubs might have their doors closed, but if an emergency strikes, they could dip into the market again. Only for available free agents who could help their cause, however.",
      "We take a look at some options that Manchester's sides could consider.",
      "Raheem Sterling is perhaps the most prominent name available for free after he parted ways with Chelsea earlier this month. The winger is reported to be open to a move outside of London, having previously seen that as a limitation after returning home when he departed Manchester City in 2022.",
      "It's difficult to see a move being forthcoming unless City want him to take a role tutoring their young players, given what he achieved at the Etihad under Guardiola.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN CITY FB PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester City Facebook page",
      "Kurt Zouma is also available, but it would maybe take some desperation and for City's defensive injury crisis to spiral out of control to see any movement. Former Barcelona and Borussia Dortmund sharpshooter Paco Alcacer is a free agent too if United want some experience to tutor the likes of Benjamin Sesko.",
      "Jesse Lingard is perhaps a more plausible move to join Carrick's side. United have shown a tendency to utilise experienced heads in Tom Huddlestone and Jonny Evans in their youth set-up, and perhaps Lingard could take on that role if he made a return.",
      "Few names will bring as much significance as James Rodriguez, who last played for Leon. A return to the Premier League seems unlikely but he is currently training alone with a World Cup to prepare for.",
      "It may be the moment to see how much Guardiola truly rated Nathan Redmond in his time at Southampton. Again, the winger would be more suited to a mentorship role, but if he's interested in coaching, perhaps an opportunity is there.",
      "Craig Dawson is another figure who would seem well-suited to helping youth players at either club given his vast Premier League experience.",
      "But perhaps Sergio Ramos could offer more experience than anyone else if he could overcome his former rivalry with Guardiola. The central defender, 39, last played for Monterrey and has even been linked with a move to AC Milan.",
      "Aaron Ramsey is also without a club after leaving Mexican side Pumas. The Welshman will likely want to challenge for a spot at the World Cup, but having managed Cardiff on an interim basis less than 12 months ago could perhaps be coaxed into a player-coach role.",

      "The window closes at 7pm today but after three successive wins under Michael Carrick there is a relaxed mood around Old Trafford, especially with the squad in a stronger position than it was at the start of the month.",
      "Joshua Zirkzee returned to the subs bench for the 3-2 win against Fulham on Sunday and he is set to stay at the club despite being linked with a loan move to Roma earlier in January. Manuel Ugarte will also remain at United after loan interest from Europe earlier in the window, but both players could be heading for the exit door in the summer.",
      "Try MEN Premium NOW for just £1",
      "Carrick is only without Matthijs de Ligt, Mason Mount and Patrick Dorgu at the moment, but De Ligt and Mount are both set to return in the short-term. Dorgu will be sidelined for more than two months with a hamstring injury.",
      "On Friday, Carrick hinted at the possibility of late business being done but that is now unlikely, with United closing the gap to Aston Villa and Manchester City after the weekend's results.",
      "\"To be honest, I think we're just working through it,\" Carrick said on Friday. \"Never say never of course, because a lot can happen and situations can be thrown up. Sometimes it's in our control, sometimes it's maybe something that's out of our control that we've got to deal with.",
      "\"I'm pretty calm. I think we've shown what we're capable of doing as a team and we'll just have to have to see what the next few days bring, but I'm definitely calm about it.\"",
      "A failed bid to sign Antoine Semenyo from Bournemouth before the window opened has been the highlight of the window and the £65million that could have gone on that transfer has been saved for the summer instead.",
      "United insist they would only move in January if a long-term target became available and after Semenyo opted to join Manchester City, that was never likely to happen.",
      "There could still be some activity at United today. Striker Ethan Wheatley is set to have a loan move to League One promotion hopefuls Bradford City confirmed.",
      "Centre-back Tyler Fredricson, 20, is set to stay at Old Trafford after picking up a calf injury that will rule him out for a month. He has made four appearances for United, including in the Carabao Cup defeat to Grimsby Town and the Boxing Day win against Newcastle this season. But the switch to a back four and Harry Maguire's return from injury has dropped Fredricson down the pecking order. There was interest from the Championship and Belgium's top flight in Fredricson but injury means he will now be staying at the club.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FACEBOOK PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "United are hoping to find loan moves for other players who have returned from loans this month. Habeeb Ogunneye, 20, has trained with the senior squad since returning from League Two Newport County, but could go out again.",
      "Goalkeeper Elyh Harrison is back from a stint at Shrewsbury Town and defenders Louis Jackson and Sonny Aljofree have returned from Notts County and Solihull Moors. Striker Joe Hugill was recalled from a loan spell with Barnet but has since joined Scottish Premiership outfit Kilmarnock on a permanent deal, while Rhys Bennett has signed for Fleetwood.",
      "Highly-rated midfielder Sekou Kone, 19, has spent the month training with Swiss side Lausanne-Sport and played in a friendly victory against Neuchâtel Xamax. Lausanne are owned by Ineos so have close links with United, but with the transfer window in Switzerland open until February 16, there is no rush to make a decision, although he is expected to join on loan.",
      "Left-back Tyrell Malacia has pushed to leave in this window, five months before his contract expires, but he is expected to stay and leave on a free transfer this summer.",

      "The result lifted United back into the top four with goals in either half from Casemiro and Matheus Cunha putting the Reds two up before Fulham hauled themselves level late on only for Benjamin Sesko to hit a last-gasp winner.",
      "The game was not without its controversy as United's first came from a free kick awarded by VAR after an initial on-field decision was to give United a penalty for a foul on Cunha.",
      "That decision angred Fulham boss Marco Silva, who was booked, and the Cottagers chief's mood will not have brightened when Jorge Cuenca's goal with 20 minutes remaining was chalked off for offside after another long VAR delay.",
      "Fulham did get a goal back when Raul Jimenez scored from the spot with six minutes to play and the visitors looked to have salvaged a point when Kevin curled home a superb stoppage time equaliser. But there was still time for Benjamin Sesko to win it in the dying moments.",

      "For the second week in a row, Carrick's United reacted to a late equaliser by going up the other end and scoring an even later winner. When Kevin hit a stunning leveller for Fulham in the 91st minute at Old Trafford, United hearts sank.",
      "They had thrown away a commanding position in the final five minutes, and players slumped to the turf. But an afternoon to forget for VAR had led to nine added minutes, and for United at their best, that is always more than enough time. To rehash a phrash we've heard a lot of recently, this is in their DNA. We weren't even halfway through that time when Benjamin Sesko controlled Bruno Fernandes' cross and arrowed a shot into the roof of the Stretford End net.",

      "Brooks pointed to the spot in the 16th minute after he felt Jorge Cuenca fouled Matheus Cunha inside the area. Replays, however, showed that Cuenca got the ball before making contact with the United forward.",
      "Then, following a VAR check, Brooks informed supporters inside the stadium that a free-kick, positioned just outside the right side of the area, was going to be awarded instead of a penalty. This came after it was viewed that Cuenca had a hold of Cunha's shirt and fouled him before the two players made their way into the box.",
      "United ended up scoring from the resulting free-kick as Bruno Fernandes crossed in a ball for Casemiro to meet and head beyond Bernd Leno, who stood little chance.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FB PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "Speaking post-match, Silva fumed that Brooks gave a spot-kick in the first place for Cuenca's challenge on Cunha. \"Top performance from ourselves,\" the Fulham boss started.",
      "\"Second half, our team was better. The way we played and controlled the ball, they wanted to press us high but we never let them. They scored when we switched off but we kept going and scored a goal that was disallowed. It is what it is. Difficult but we have to accept it.",
      "\"The story of the game started with a horrendous terrible decision from John Brooks with the penalty he gave. Horrendous decision from that moment, big, big mistake. It was the first time we saw all the Premier League fans and us coaches and players. We have to take all this frustration to win the next one.\"",
      "Manchester United were initially given a penalty for a foul on Matheus Cunha(Image: Getty Images)",
      "When pressed on VAR's decision to overrule Brooks, Silva added: \"The penalty was given by the tackle. After, because the decision was so bad, they found a different foul.\"",
      "Silva was then asked if decisions went against Fulham, after his side were then denied a goal in the 65th minute for an offside in the build-up to a close-range finish from Jorge Cuenca.",
      "\"I feel my players, I feel our fans but we have to respect and the people in charge,\" Silva said. \"I know why the penalty was given. VAR went in a completely different direction to find something to find a free-kick that was not the reason why the penalty was given.\"",
      "Silva's rant on Brooks and the officiating ended when he was quizzed on whether he had spoken to Brooks. \"I don't want get more cards because I want to be on the touchline,\" he finished. \"I don't want to speak more.\"",
      "Benjamin Sesko ended up proving to be the match-winner for United after Fulham had come from 2-0 down to pull it back to 2-2 in stoppage-time. But United snatched it in the 94th minute with Sesko firing home from inside the box after Bruno Fernandes had pulled the ball into his path.",

      "Benjamin Sesko and Joshua Zirkzee celebrate after Manchester United's win against Fulham(Image: Getty Images)",
      "Joshua Zirkzee showed his true colours as he was the first Manchester United player to run over to Benjamin Sesko after his winning goal against Fulham.",
      "Sesko, 22, has endured a difficult start to life at Old Trafford since his £74million move from RB Leipzig last summer, but he stepped up to the plate with a match-winning moment, scoring in the 94th minute to secure United a dramatic 3-2 victory on Sunday afternoon.",
      "The Slovenia international, who had found the net just five times in 20 matches going into the visit of Fulham, was introduced as a 74th minute substitute for Matheus Cunha and he had to wait until stoppage-time for his time to shine. Indeed, just moments after Fulham had made it 2-2 through Kevin, Bruno Fernandes set up Sesko to hammer the ball into the top corner and snatch all three points.",
      "And as Sesko wheeled away to celebrate in the South-West corner, Zirkzee, who had been warming up, was the first United player to run across to the forward to celebrate with him, grabbing him and showing how delighted he was. That came as a surprise to some United fans as Sesko and Zirkzee have been battling for first-team minutes throughout most of the season.",
      "But in that moment, Zirkzee displayed his class and character by congratulating Sesko and grabbing his shoulder before the rest of his United teammates made their way to him. Even after the full-time whistle was blown, Sesko and Zirkzee had another moment together and were both locked side-by-side.",

      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FB PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "Sesko and Zirkzee were both named on the bench to face Fulham as interim head coach Michael Carrick opted to pick Bryan Mbeumo as the central striker with Matheus Cunha and Amad Diallo either side.",
      "With Carrick making a change up front, Cunha was brought off and Sesko was chosen as the man to come on instead of Zirkzee, who remained as an unused substitute.",
      "Zirkzee has been linked with a move away from United this month and he has failed to play a single minute since Carrick became the club's new manager last month.",
      "He wasn't included in the matchday squad to face Manchester City and Arsenal, and only got the call up to the bench for Fulham due to Patrick Dorgu's injury setback.",
      "The Netherlands international's last appearance for the Reds came in the FA Cup defeat to Brighton in Darren Fletcher's final game in caretaker charge.",
      "As for Sesko, he now has six goals for United and Carrick was full of praise for him post-match. \"A huge moment,\" Carrick said. \"I'm so, so pleased. Everyone in the changing room, players, staff, delighted for him, absolutely delighted for him. And the reception he got when he came back in the changing room, told us everything. He’s even confident, to be honest.",
      "\"We've worked with him a lot in different ways over the last couple of weeks. He's bright in training. He's looked dangerous, he's done extra.",
      "\"The coaches have done a lot of bits on the side and Travis [Binnion], particularly, he's done a lot of work one on one with him.\"",

      "The Premier League have explained why VAR made the decision to rule a Fulham goal out against Manchester United on Sunday. Marco Silva's side thought they had pulled one back in the 65th minute when Jorge Cuenca tapped home from close range after Samuel Chukwueze's shot was blocked.",
      "The ball had fallen to Chukwueze inside the box after Raul Jimenez's free-kick hit the wall, and the former's snapshot was blocked by Lisandro Martinez before Cuenca was there to prod into the back of the net. However, following a long check, VAR decided to rule out the goal as it was viewed that Chukwueze was offside in the build-up.",
      "Replays showed that Chukwueze's shoulder strayed beyond the last man - Amad Diallo - and therefore VAR stepped in and ruled the goal out, despite a delay of around four minutes.",
      "Shortly after referee John Brooks informed the Old Trafford crowd that the goal wasn't going to stand, the Premier League released a statement to explain the decision.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FB PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "Alongside a video showing Chukwueze's shoulder in an offside position, the Premier League's Match Centre account said on X: \"#MUNFUL – 65’ VAR OVERTURN VAR checked the referee’s call of goal – and established that Chukwueze was in an offside position and recommended that the goal was disallowed.\"",
      "With United leading 2-0 thanks to goals either side of half-time from Casemiro and Matheus Cunha, Fulham did eventually pull one back in the 85th minute and it came from the penalty spot. After Harry Maguire fouled Jimenez inside the area, the Mexican pulled himself back up to score from 12 yards.",
      "Fulham then had the momentum and the Whites thought they had nicked an unlikely point in stoppage-time as Kevin made it 2-2 with a terrific strike from the edge of the box.",
      "But United fought back and won it in the 94th minute as Bruno Fernandes' cross found Benjamin Sesko, who took a touch before swivelling and hitting a precise shot into the top corner.",
      "It sparked wild scenes inside Old Trafford as Michael Carrick's side ended up holding out for a 3-2 win and a third success in a row after beating Manchester City and Arsenal last month.",

      "Lammens made an impressive debut against Sunderland.(Image: Getty Images)",
      "Senne Lammens wore a polo shirt and a navy sweatshirt when he visited Old Trafford after signing for Manchester United. The young goalkeeper looked as though he could be joining United to work in their HR department.",
      "The same observation was made when Lammens reported for international duty with Belgium last week - the 23-year-old was dressed in a beige collared jacket, a khaki t-shirt and chinos.",
      "\"By accident, I saw an article saying he was wearing something boring when he reported for international duty and fans saying they hoped he stays like this,\" laughed Hayk Milkon, one of Lammens' former coaches.",
      "\"This 'boringness' is just the way Senne is, he's really calm and no excesses. He focuses on what he needs to focus on and is open with the people around him. He keeps his feet on the ground.\"",
      "If Lammens looks like someone who could work in an office, every workplace would love to have him in their five-a-side team. United believe they have signed a young goalkeeper with huge potential, and fans who were present at Old Trafford against Sunderland left the stadium buzzing about his debut.",
      "The quirk is that Lammens appears to be a different person when he wears his goalkeeper kit. He made a supremely confident United debut, aggressively commanded his area and kept a clean sheet.",
      "Milkon coached Lammens during their time together at Club Brugge. Milkon is now the youngest manager in the Belgian top-flight and Lammens plays for the biggest club in England.",
      "\"It was Senne with his headphones on. He would go into the gym to do his recovery or some extra top-ups. Or he would just go to relax by playing basketball - he loved to play basketball.\"",
      "Lammens celebrates against Sunderland. (Image: 2025 Ben Roberts - Danehouse)",
      "Milkon coached in different roles at Club Brugge. He was the assistant of Club NXT (their reserve team), served as their interim manager, was in charge of the Under-18s and eventually became a first-team coach.",
      "His time at Club Brugge coincided with Lammens progressing from the academy to their first team, so he is uniquely positioned to provide insight into United's new goalkeeper signing.",
      "Lammens joined Club Brugge's academy when he was 12. \"He was a guy with huge potential,\" said Milkon. \"As I learned from colleagues who had worked with him when he was much younger, I heard there was a moment that clicked in his head when he became super professional.",
      "\"He was one of the guys during Covid - when the players were not able to train - who was doing a lot at home, he was really going far with this to be the best in these types of areas.",
      "\"Then he continued like this when he joined the first team to train with them. He always wanted to improve. We also had something in place to look at the parameters on which goalkeepers are judged.",
      "\"You see the potential of the goalkeeper based on what they do in games; so their positioning, their decision-making and so on, and Senne was always quite high in these areas.",
      "\"The only bad luck that he had was that the first-team goalkeeper was Simon Mignolet. He's an amazing goalkeeper, so it was difficult for Senne to stay over there in the role of No.2.",
      "\"That would have also blocked his growth, so it was good for him in the end to make the step to go to Antwerp and he did a tremendous job there. It was amazing to see how fast he adapted.\"",
      "Milkon pictured during his stint with Club Brugge (he now manages F.C.V. Dender).",
      "Milkon continued: \"I think for us at Club Brugge, it was very clear to everyone that Senne was a top goalkeeper. He would have been the perfect fit for Club Brugge to be the No.1.",
      "\"That was not possible because Mignolet was there. But the parameters that we used to judge his performances indicated he was ticking so many boxes already, and he was consistently doing it.",
      "\"There weren't ups and downs with his performances. He was consistently really high and when you compare this to the top goalkeepers, you have a benchmark to say 'Ok, what potential does this guy have?'",
      "\"He had some chances with the first team at Club Brugge and made a mistake, or maybe two, but in the end it was very clear to everyone that he was a top goalkeeper.",
      "\"It was impossible to try to extend his contract because, again, you have Mignolet, and you cannot block a guy like this. You know he has to go out, he has to play, and he will improve even more.\"",
      "When asked about Lammens' strengths, he said: \"I would say that his decision-making was very good. He is very calm, he sees the solutions on the pitch, he has a quick reaction time and understands the balance between risk and reward, and which decisions are the right ones to make.",
      "\"His clean passing is great, his footwork was really good, and he's just an amazing goalkeeper with the shot-stopping. He made some incredible saves back then already. He's quite a complete goalkeeper.",
      "\"But making the right decisions at a very young age, being very mature with this, was really impressive. And the fact that he is good with both feet is another big strength.",
      "\"For me, Senne is a very calm guy and has all the qualities to be a top professional. That was my impression when I first met him when he was younger and he never changed.\"",
      "A baby-faced Lammens playing for Club Brugge in 2021. (Image: 2021 BSR Agency)",
      "Lammens joined Royal Antwerp on a free transfer in the summer of 2023. He was handed his debut a few months later and served as an understudy that season, but earned first-choice status for 2024/2025.",
      "His performances drew attention from the Belgian media. Lammens saved four penalties across a successful first full campaign and received a call-up to Belgium's senior squad in March.",
      "Milkon said: \"I was not surprised when I saw Manchester United had come calling. And to record his first clean sheet, I was really happy for him. Senne is a potential No.1 for the Red Devils - the Belgium national team.",
      "\"He got his chance, he took it, and we're all really proud of him, but we knew it would happen. I believe he has all the capabilities to become the best in the world, so I wish him all the best. I'm sure he will have a very good career in England, and Manchester United should return to the big club they used to be.",
      "\"He will have a positive impact on that, for sure, and hopefully he will be Belgium's first-choice goalkeeper soon. I believe he has the potential, the skillset and the personality to do that.",
      "\"For me, it was just having a tiny little part in having an influence on him at Brugge, but it was the most positive memories of our relationship that we had during this spell.",
      "\"I'm very proud that he is reaching these high levels and not surprised. I believe he will be successful because he is a guy who will not change his focus or start to do something different. He is calm, that's his personality and character, and he wants to succeed. He is hungry and will keep working to be his best.",
      "\"He is so calm, and you have to be patient in football. You cannot worry too much and want things too early, but finding the balance between not being impatient and, at the same time, pushing and demanding what you deserve in a good way, means everything will sort itself out.\"",
      "Lammens in action for Royal Antwerp in 2024. (Image: Photonews 2024)",
      "United staff who have worked with Lammens at Carrington have echoed Milkon's sentiments. He has been described as \"really mature for his age\" and is said to have taken the move in his stride.",
      "Lammens is understood to have impressed coaches during training sessions and a United source said that lots of people have been speaking positively about him. He has already relocated from the luxury hotel where he was initially staying and into a house.",
      "It's no surprise that Lammens likes to play basketball at 6ft 3in, but he is a keen golfer, which is common ground with the likes of Tom Heaton, Luke Shaw, Mason Mount and Harry Maguire.",
      "Matthijs de Ligt, Amad, Maguire and Shaw jogged straight to Lammens to congratulate him after full-time against Sunderland. \"Are you Schmeichel in disguise?\" was chanted at Lammens from the Stretford End.",
      "It remains to be seen whether Lammens will start against Liverpool on Sunday, but it would be a surprise to see him on the bench after delivering a strong debut before the international break.",
      "There would be nothing boring about keeping another clean sheet - this time at Anfield.",
      "Kitbag has slashed the price of Man United kits and merch with up to 50% off select items.",

      "The Premier League has gone a little bit sack crazy. Managergeddon is upon us and we are entirely here for the drama.",
      "Five clubs have changed manager since September. One has already done so twice, and another may yet follow that path. If/when that happens Nuno Espirito Santo will have lost not one but two Premier League jobs within mere months of getting Nottingham Actual Forest into Europe.",
      "But a couple of wins have eased the pressure on Nuno – a couple of wins really is all it takes to transform this market currently – and  even a grim point at Burnley is enough to save Thomas Frank, among whose latest crimes is wandering around Bournemouth with a little Arsenal coffee cup in his hands and also losing to the aforementioned Nuno in El Sackico. And – this bit feels important – serving up some of the least watchable football on Premier League record. It is surely ‘when’ not ‘if’ territory there, despite an absurd and very Spurs draw against Man City.",
      "And it now looks like Arne Slot rather than Frank or Nuno will be the latest ‘winner’ here as Liverpool’s fraudulent unbeaten run finally came to an end at Bournemouth, who like West Ham, have been rejuvenated by Frank and Dr Tottenham.",
      "Frank, of course, only moved to Spurs in the summer to replace Ange Postecoglou who has already been hired and sacked by Nottingham Forest since then, while the true lay of the land at big clubs is laid bare by the fact two of the Big Six have binned off managers not for unacceptable results on the pitch but for unacceptable failure to acknowledge infallible wisdom and brilliance of their boardroom superiors. It is immensely modern football and there is almost zero chance we’ve seen the last of the managergeddon for the season. Not by a long chalk.",
      "Meanwhile, here are possible replacement managers currently between jobs, any one of whom really could, if they’re not careful, accidentally end up manager of Tottenham before the season is out.",
      "Rankings based on the latest best prices available at Oddschecker.com…",
      "",
      "An earlier version of this oft-updated piece speculated on what might happen to Mikel Arteta should Arsenal suffer from their Nightmare Start. What if they lost a few early games? What then? We concluded this:",
      "It’s far likelier that Arsenal emerge blinking into the autumn sunshine broadly unscathed from their nightmare horrors. No denying that this season does represent one in which Arteta might completely lose the plot and go entirely off the rails. Or the one where he wins the league by 10 points. Feels like we’re odds-on to get one or the other.",
      "Arsenal emerged duly unscathed, and cashed in on the shift to easier fixtures of their own alongside much tougher ones for Liverpool to take top spot and control in the Premier League.",
      "Only question that remains, therefore, is what Arsenal do from here. We are still absolutely certain that it either involves p*ssing the league by 10 points or a complete and total meltdown. Nothing in between is acceptable or even conceivable, and even now with 15 games to go both options appear tantalisingly plausible.",
      "READ: Who will be the next manager of Arsenal if Mikel Arteta is sacked?",
      "",
      "Doing so well that even suffering the ultimate embarrassment of defeat at Old Trafford hasn’t dampened spirits for the most impressive promoted club in quite some time.",
      "Eight wins in the bag already and more points than any of the promoted-relegated teams managed in the entirety of 24/25. Widespread expectation that tougher games would bring Sunderland back down with a bump have thus far proved wide of the mark; there won’t be many teams unhappy at taking four points from two games against Chelsea and Arsenal this season. The comeback victory over Bournemouth was evidence, if indeed it was still required, that Sunderland are proper, as was beating beleaguered Palace at home.",
      "Success against Newcastle on derby day has us firmly into ‘manager of the year’ territory for one of the big pre-season Sack Race favourites.",
      "",
      "Extraordinary season for Emery already. Began the campaign right at the outside of this market with your Artetas and – unlikely as it now sounds – Slots. Then jumped right up to third favourite when Villa’s rankling disappointment at how last season ended leaked into a six-match winless start to this campaign.",
      "But then along came four Premier League wins in a row to thoroughly lift the mood at a club where a few short weeks earlier it really did feel like they’d come to the end of something special without ever getting the definitive moment of success it deserved.",
      "That run reached 12 wins in 13 Premier League games to lift Villa right through the mid-table slop, then into the top four, and then genuine title contention. And for the first 45 minutes at the Emirates it really did look like they might stick around for much longer.",
      "A sticky run has brought that talk to an end. There’s obviously no shame in not managing to stick around as unlikely title challengers for longer, but some frustration at the manner in which their charge has been halted. Home defeats to Everton and Brentford, given the fortress Villa Park had become, is a bit of a limp end to a game old fight.",
      "But they’re still very much on course for another crack at the Champions League and they’ve also qualified unfussily for the last 16 of a very winnable Europa League. An astonishing shift from what felt like an inexorable downward spiral not that long ago.",
      "We could all learn something from that, but we won’t.",
      "",
      "The continuity candidate in the summer, and looked to have received the ultimate hospital pass. How much continuity could there be at Brentford given they’d sold Bryan Mbeumo, Yoane Wissa and Christian Norgaard, while Thomas Frank took most of the remaining coaching staff with him to Tottenham? It was a very Brentford move to promote from within and we’ll hold our hands up and admit we thought it would go far, far worse than it has.",
      "With Newcastle and Sunderland added to Liverpool and Manchester United on the list of Gtech victims this season and Villa now sorted out home, away and in the Carabao, it’s an undeniably impressive effort in trying circumstances.",
      "That Brentford now sit cosily in Europe-adjacent upper mid-table, seven points clear of their former manager and his supposedly greener pastures, is quite something.",
      "",
      "Backed in to a hot favourite as the whispers began before the last international break. But just when we thought it might be time to accept something is fundamentally broken here as a relegation fight bubbled up, an impressive win over Sunderland and a restorative visit to Tottenham have sorted things out.",
      "Seven wins and two draws in 13 Premier League games since the November international break have lifted Fulham well away from the relegation battle and into the mid-table strivers, significantly lessening the real risk that either Silva or Fulham might do something they live to regret.",
      "",
      "Sounds preposterous, but there really is a non-zero chance Moyes gets punished for easing Everton’s immediate relegation fears and they seek some more enterprising football from a squad that is, in fairness, capable of that as climbing into the top six demonstrates. Does feel like a very familiar Everton story, though, and one that ends with them 16th, chastened, and bringing in another firefighter.",
      "",
      "Instantly unseated Eddie Howe and Thomas Frank at the top of the list of Premier League managers to sound most like a High Performance Podcast guest with that absurd cack about ageing men.",
      "This is Chelsea, so he absolutely could be gone before the end of the season. But this is managergeddon, and there’s almost no chance at least one other poor sod doesn’t go first. Which is for the best. We’d hate to think of Rosenior being forced out of Chelsea before he’s had any real chance to age any men at all.",
      "",
      "Fine end to 24/25 put a different complexion on Brighton’s season than at one time appeared likely. Ending up a clear best of the rest outside the quickly established top seven represented at least a passing grade and they’d have had to make a truly awful start to the season to get in any kind of managerial-change bother.",
      "The win over Newcastle to go with victory at Chelsea to go with a win over City reaffirmed Brighton’s big-boy-bothering calibre, but does also make some of their other results – draws with Fulham and Spurs (from 2-0 up) and Wolves and West Ham (twice), for instance – a bit annoying.",
      "We still subscribe to the view that every team between about seventh and 14th is equally good/bad and that no major judgement for good or bad should be based on whichever arbitrary position has been handed to them this week.",
      "",
      "Remained powerfully unsackable even in the depths of one of those long forlorn runs of relegation form that Bournemouth have oft indulged in under Iraola. And now they’re back doing the other thing they do after dramatic 3-2 wins over Spurs and Liverpool and victory at Wolves.",
      "A streaky manager of a streaky team, then, but with relegation a distant memory after the prognostications of doom when he had to sell pretty much his entire defence in the summer he remains firmly in credit and back in contention for all the many ridiculous Big Six jobs that are or will be available during the summer.",
      "",
      "The hard-nosed yet valid argument persists that Leeds could and perhaps should have taken drastic action in the summer even after their very good week. It would have made Spurs’ decision to sack Europa League-winning Ange Postecoglou look positively kind, Leeds – and Burnley for that matter – might now be better off had they thanked the managers who secured 100 Championship points and got them back into the big time and then sent them on their way.",
      "Farke had a dreadful Premier League record of only six wins and 26 points from his 49 games in charge of Norwich, a team he twice led to promotion from the Championship with 94 and 97 points.",
      "As well as fighting his own record in this competition, Farke faced the added burden of expectation levels very different to those at just about any other club that could possibly find itself promoted into the Premier League in this current era where that represents the most bittersweet of successes.",
      "Defeat at Burnley was honking, but bouncing back to win another six-pointer against West Ham eased the stress significantly before a paddling at Brighton and events elsewhere – including West Ham themselves – left Farke desperately short of immediate cover before a desperately poor show in a six-pointer at Nottingham Forest.",
      "Another painful defeat having gone in front, against Villa this time, saw Leeds drop into the bottom three ahead of a brutal run of games, but that run has gone surprisingly well. The narrow loss to Man City preceded a rare home win against Chelsea and comeback draw against Liverpool.",
      "The question now is whether Leeds and Farke have really hit on something sustainable, or this is merely delaying the inevitable. After the 4-1 win against Crystal Palace and a very decent point at Sunderland, it really does start to look like it might be the latter which has enormous repercussions for both Farke and several other names around him on this list.",
      "Enormously impressive even in heartbreaking defeat at Newcastle in a wild 4-3 that earned instant classic status. Key now is to ensure that it doesn’t throw them off course, because once the initial pain subsides there is no reason why it should. Victory over Fulham suggests they’ve taken it on the chin; getting slapped silly a second time by Arsenal suggests maybe not.",
      "February is a huge month for Leeds and Farke in the league; a proper blood-and-thunder six-pointer against Nottingham Forest and then three of the current top five.",
      "",
      "Might actually have made Wolves… quite good? Certainly a lot less bad, anyway. It is still almost certainly too little, too late, but that’s also not really Rob Edwards’ fault either.",
      "The first win of the season was a cathartic dismantling of a doom-laden West Ham, and it didn’t come out of a clear blue sky either. There had been signs of life even in defeat at Arsenal and Liverpool, before running away giggling from Old Trafford with a point.",
      "After a draw at Everton and another at home to Newcastle, that run became six points from four games. That’s a pretty big deal when you only managed two from the previous 18 games.",
      "Stranger things have happened, but admittedly not many. And most of them in the actual Stranger Things. On balance, Wolves would also probably rather believe in a wild conspiracy theory that suggests this current season has actually been entirely fake and that the real ending is yet to be revealed.",
      "",
      "A 4-1 thumping of Everton followed a simply huge and wildly unexpected win over Manchester City. Had Newcastle lost that, as all pre-interlull indications suggested they would, then the spotlight would have been harsh indeed on Howe and his team. They would at that point find themselves slap bang in the muck of a relegation scrap; instead they have lifted themselves back into the mid-table morass and – with absolutely nobody in there being actually any good at all – have now managed to get themselves right to the very top of it, firmly back into the Champions League equation, via nothing more complicated than three straight wins.",
      "The 4-3 victory over Leeds was admittedly quite complicated, but also just tremendously exciting. Pure Newcastle heritage. The drab 0-0 at Wolves, not so much, while a limp home defeat to Aston Villa had Howe once again under fire before a tame surrender at Liverpool.",
      "",
      "Decision time for Burnley. There are two options available, and they prompt inevitable questions.",
      "Option one: Burnley decide to really try and beat relegation, and must decide whether they think Parker is the best man for that job.",
      "Option two: Burnley accept their overwhelmingly likely fate, and must decide whether Parker the best man to get them back up again.",
      "Parker’s job prospects likely rest on the decision. Because if it is indeed option two, he has a compelling case. Option one? He’s f*cked.",
      "But the longer he remains in place, the greater the chance that option two is the one. And right now he’s doing just enough to keep the wolves (literal and figurative) from the door.",
      "",
      "Has done more than could ever have been expected given the chaos he walked into. That epic pants-pulling at Anfield and joyful spangling of Tottenham should be enough to buy any manager coming into a relegation-haunted club serious time.",
      "But Mr Marinakis’ lair is never a safe place for any manager to lurk, and there have been a pair of honking defeats against Everton and a weirdly rubbish performance against Brighton as well that will have had one of 2025’s key supervillains twitching over his big red sack button once more.",
      "Looked in very serious trouble when trailing at half-time against West Ham; Forest’s first win in a Premier League game they’d been losing at half-time since 1997 was enormously well timed. Going out of the FA Cup at Wrexham not so much.",
      "Victory at Brentford has given Forest and Dyche a bit of breathing space despite West Ham’s recent improvements, but it does look like we’ve got a multi-team battle to avoid one relegation spot and that is going to make everyone twitchy.",
      "",
      "It was quite a 2025 for Nuno. He ended 2024 as our manager of the year; he ended 2025 looking in imminent danger of his second sacking of the season.",
      "Seven points from three games against Newcastle, Burnley and Bournemouth left things looking far comfier than might have been expected for a manager who, when the Magpies took an early lead at the London Stadium, looked to be heading for a second sack of the season long before the Christmas decorations went up.",
      "But quite why Nuno had to be so very Nuno in the way he, on the back of 3-1 and 3-2 wins and a 2-2 draw, decided to approach a home game against a Liverpool team that had just suffered three consecutive three-goal defeats, is puzzling, irritating and, above all, a reminder that he is here as a firefighter and that the marriage to a fanbase with limited patience for drab and functional let’s-not-get-relegated football is merely one of convenience.",
      "However, for neither the first nor last time, Tottenham have come to the rescue. The momentum from a job-saving win at Spurs was parlayed into an even more impressive win over Sunderland and, despite the horrific late gut-punch, there was enough about the defeat at Chelsea to suggest the Hammers can at least drag some of the other stupid teams into the equation.",
      "",
      "A sacking remains out of the question despite continued (relative) struggles. There hasn’t been a Premier League manager since Fergie in his pomp with more credit in the bank than Pep.",
      "But is there still a distinct chance Guardiola decides he’s had enough and simply walks away? We reckon there is as they eye ‘two’ alternatives, and it’s always worth remembering that we’re talking Next Premier League Manager To Leave here, and that the traditional ‘Sack Race’ shorthand is a bit misleading.",
      "Somehow, despite themselves, City have managed to just about remain in the title race. But they are so unconvincing in how they’re going about it. If/when Arsenal do manage to make their superiority properly count in the league table, will Pep decide to sod it all for a game of soldiers? Possibly yes, but almost no chance that happens before at least one other Big Six team pulls the trigger.",
      "",
      "Definitely leaving at the end of the season, and very probably before that given the extent to which this relationship now appears to be breaking down. Palace are currently matching Spurs stride for pitiful stride in freefalling towards the trapdoor.",
      "He’s currently among the names being considered by Manchester United for the permanent manager’s job that is set to be available this summer. And that’s before we mention Liverpool and Spurs. He really does deserve a crack at a big job; it’s just a shame really that they are all, in their way, so very silly.",
      "But so too are Palace. They are without a win in 11 games – a run that even includes airily dismissing the help of Dr Tottenham – and have achieved an FA Cup first as a top-flight side in managing to be eliminated by a sixth-tier one. This is all either very bad or very clever timing, depending on how you view the desirability of those various Big Six options.",
      "The prospect of Glasner walking long before his contract expires sounds very real.",
      "",
      "",
      "",
      "Impossible to avoid the conclusion that Slot’s reaction to Liverpool’s mini-crisis becoming actual-crisis was poor. He went Full Klopp with his salty loser behaviour when Manchester United committed the crime of altering their tactics to give themselves the best chance of success against Liverpool, and the headloss continued after another chaotic and unstructured performance led to a 3-2 defeat at Brentford.",
      "Having ticked ‘opposition doing tactics wrong’ off his rattled manager bingo card, he can now add ‘losing his mind over entirely uncontroversial refereeing decisions’ with his response to both the Cody Gakpo non-penalty and Virgil van Dijk penalty at the Gtech.",
      "It has to be a worry for Liverpool that Slot has for the first time in his Anfield career found himself under any kind of pressure after a chastening run of defeats, and suffered severe and instant headloss as a result.",
      "Funny to think of a manager who’s beaten Real Madrid in the Champions League being under threat, but defeat at the Etihad was miserable before Nottingham Forest came along and achieved the amusing feat of being the first team to shut Liverpool out in the Premier League at Anfield since Nottingham Forest.",
      "And then there was a new nadir against PSV. That really was very, very bad. West Ham were wonderfully welcoming hosts on Sunday, but to such an inexplicable extent that it’s hard to know just how much to read into Liverpool’s 2-0 win at the London Stadium against opponents who were barely there. Predictably, they were poor in a 1-1 against proper team Sunderland and showed no backbone in the collapse at Leeds United, which was then followed by a distinctly unwelcome MO SALAH BOMBSHELL that does leave things looking distinctly like either he or the manager will have to go.",
      "A run of four consecutive wins cooled the immediate temperatures, but it all felt extremely precarious. The wins over Spurs and Wolves lacked any real authority. And then there were careless draws against Leeds and Fulham.",
      "There was another draw at Arsenal, though this was comfortably the most promising of their most recent stalemates. Still, this has not stopped Liverpool from coming up with a ‘contingency plan’, which might be enacted after drawing at home to Burnley and losing at Bournemouth, although an impressive win over Newcastle has been enough to knock Slot off top spot.",
      "",
      "There have been good days and bad – losing at home to West Ham felt like the latter – and our whole pondering of Frank’s situation at Spurs has been about determining which of the two would eventually win out. The harrowing NLD-PSG-Fulham week was the first time he really did look f*cked.",
      "Spurs were timid and abysmal in the North London Derby, the second big London derby in a row which Frank had approached more in the manner of a League One manager attempting to avoid a paddling in the FA Cup third round than a legitimate rival facing a familiar foe.",
      "There was some encouragement in a 5-3 Champions League defeat at PSG, but even the very fact it’s possible to write the words ‘some encouragement in a 5-3 Champions League defeat’ is in its own way damning.",
      "But at least those two defeats came against what genuinely might be the two best teams in Europe at this time. With all due respect to Fulham and the sterling work of Marco Silva in recent years, they are not one of the two best teams in Europe at this time, and they were still much better than Spurs who torpedoed themselves inside the opening seven minutes to extend their extraordinarily – and in fairness largely pre-Frank – awful home record in the Premier League to three wins in 21 games since an increasingly odd-looking 4-1 win over Aston Villa in November last year.",
      "Frank’s response to the booing of Guglielmo Vicario after his hideous blunder was firmly in the ‘That’s true, but he shouldn’t say it’ category. And the way he went about it was all wrong.",
      "There should have been some acknowledgement that the booing of Vicario, unsavoury and unhelpful as it may have been, did not burst forth from a clear blue sky but instead a bubbling frustration from fans who pay among the highest ticket prices in the country to watch what is now among the worst and least effective football in the country.",
      "To instead label those supporters – and the boos did not come from a tiny minority inside the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium – not real Spurs fans was another gaffe that pushes the manager further towards the exit.",
      "Until that point we’d felt the obvious comparisons between Thomas Frank and Nuno Espirito Santo didn’t quite fit.",
      "But it’s certainly starting to look uncomfortably similar in familiar ways; the small-time approach to big games has not been well received and the fear grows that he just doesn’t understand what this job requires. The fact almost no manager in Premier League history has managed to understand what this job requires is cold comfort at this time.",
      "However, from there Spurs went to Newcastle and got a draw (albeit a ludicrous one) before they had a dominant 2-0 win against Frank’s old club Brentford, which everyone at Spurs sorely needed. It was easily their most convincing Premier League performance since the win at City on matchday two and a result that could have been even more compelling.",
      "They then pretty much secured a Champions League play-off round spot at the very least with a fine 3-0 win over Slavia Prague.",
      "But Spurs are Spurs, so they followed that with the worst performance yet of Frank’s reign in a truly inept and miserable 3-0 defeat at Nottingham Forest.",
      "Bringing Joao Palhinha and Ben Davies on to try and hold on to a 2-0 defeat and not even managing that feels uncomfortably like the infamous Nuno Moment against Manchester United.",
      "Have reached the kind of state where a dreadful home defeat to a very poor Liverpool is being dressed up as ‘signs of encouragement’. In reality, it might have been the worst possible result; still a defeat, yet one that risks extending the increasingly obviously doomed reign of the latest manager to be chewed up and spat out by the country’s most preposterous football club.",
      "The win at Palace was welcome if deeply unconvincing, while the sheer small-timery of a mind-meltingly dull goalless draw at Brentford really might have hurt Frank more than any of the many, many defeats. Or at least we thought that before they somehow contrived to Dr Tottenham their way to a 3-2 defeat at a Bournemouth side on a horrific streak while Frank was holding an Arsenal-branded cup.",
      "That and the fact the winning goal was scored by Antoine Semenyo with his last kick for Bournemouth before toddling off to pass the next two years on Man City’s bench were just the latest reminders that Spurs are a club where ridiculous things happen routinely, and that Frank simply isn’t and never will be capable of dealing with that.",
      "And in a strange way, that’s to his credit. It does look like Spurs are determined to try and muddle through the season with the obviously doomed Frank at the wheel, and in an odd way his immediate future might have more to do with West Ham than Spurs. It is West Ham’s (admittedly Spurs-assisted) resurgence and with it the very real danger of relegation that might finally get the Spurs board to see what has been alarmingly obvious to the fans for many weeks now.",

      "Liverpool were paid £174.9m as champions – short of Manchester City’s record £176.2m in 2022/23 – while Newcastle received just over £160m to chuck into their PSR black hole.",
      "Southampton were handed £109.2m for their efforts in finishing a distant bottom. It pays to be in the Premier League.",
      "Some of those payments are fixed. All 20 clubs automatically receive around £96.9m through an equal share distributed based on both the domestic (£29.8m in 2024/25) and international (£59.2m in 2024/25) broadcast deals – those TV rights are lucrative for a reason – as well as £7.9m each from central commercial revenue streams.",

      "For the 2024/25 season, the difference in prize money was around £2.7m per position. Southampton were given as much for finishing bottom, all the way up to champions Liverpool receiving £53.1m. It basically helped pay for 97.4% of Giorgi Mamardashvili and Jeremie Frimpong.",
      "That can be expected to fluctuate with inflation and other factors – it was around £2.8m per position in 2023/24 – but it offers a rough guide as to what clubs should expect to earn this season.",

Arsenal had 29 matches and were paid £24.2m, while Manchester United (28 games for £23.4m), Aston Villa (27 games for £22.6m) and Chelsea (26 games for £21.8m) were televised frequently and rewarded handsomely.",

Manchester United’s prize money after finishing 15th last season was £136.2m, more than the four clubs immediately above them – West Ham (£130.9m in 14th), Everton (£131.8m in 13th), Crystal Palace (£136.1m in 12th) and Fulham (£135.5m in 11th) – as Ruben Amorim’s side were picked for far more live TV games.",

His belief is that Crystal Palace “are starting again from two years ago, having to teach them how we want to play and how we want to attack”.",
      "The Nottingham Forest draw was a difficult lesson in that regard: 45 chastening minutes being out-played by the side in 17th with 10 men cannot be entirely blamed on having to wait one entire day of January before spending £35m on Brennan Johnson.",
      "It just isn’t going to work. The resentment he still carries against a hierarchy identifying potential signings to both appease a coach who is leaving in a matter of months and to suit his successor is clear, and having an obvious impact on the pitch.",
      "Glasner feels they are “taking a step backwards” by recruiting players in mid-season and having to indoctrinate them in his ways while in the weeds of a 12-game winless run.",
      "But his rudimentary inability to coach against low blocks feels like a bigger problem: since the start of last season, Palace have had more than 50 per cent possession in 14 Premier League games, and won only three of them (with 55 per cent v Ipswich, with 53 per cent v Spurs and with 52 per cent v Wolves).",
      "With 67 per cent on the ball against Nottingham Forest, their issues – albeit without progressive ball players the calibre of Adam Wharton and Daichi Kamada – were laid painfully bare.",
      "",
      "Eddie Howe can pretend all he likes that “PSR is controlling what we’re able to do, and you’ll understand that gives us limited room to manoeuvre – to try to bring a player in who is good enough to elevate the group and to have a long-term future at the football club, with the finances we have available, is very difficult”.",
      "But it rings hollow when your bench at Anfield is occupied by two centre-forwards signed in the summer for a combined £120m, watching three wide forwards buzz around in an eternal 4-3-3.",
      "Howe has to find another way of coping, especially against this calibre of opposition. Newcastle have won a single game out of eight against the current top six; the only clubs with fewer points from matches against Arsenal, Manchester City, Aston Villa, Manchester United, Chelsea and Liverpool this season than the Magpies (five) are the bottom three.",
      "This was meant to be the season Newcastle properly challenged the foundations of the elite, armed with a trophy, Champions League qualification and a record level of investment. Between last summer and this season, the sheer depths of that gap have only been emphasised.",
      "",
      "It feels like this is precisely what Unai Emery meant when he told everyone to shut up about the title and said Aston Villa “are still not being contenders” for the top five as “there are other teams with more potential than us”.",
      "One home defeat to 10-man Brentford with Tammy Abraham leading the line and two substitutions being made while chasing the game later, and Jamie Redknapp need no longer performatively pretend not to understand the point.",
      "If they’re not already ignoring the temptation to look up at Arsenal and instead stare down at a resurgent Manchester United, Chelsea and Liverpool, now is probably the time.",
      "",
      "No defender has been dribbled past more often per 90 minutes in the Premier League this season. Knee surgery, missing pre-season and facing Amad will do that to you.",
      "",
      "Is James Milner really worth sacrificing your job for?",

      "It was an important test for Carrick but also an important lesson. Chelsea and Liam Rosenior learned that resting your best players is dangerous, and Carrick learned that taking them off, even at 2-0, is also pretty dangerous.",
      "Casemiro, Ruben Amorim’s biggest success story, continues to impress and staked a claim for the club to extend his contract beyond this summer with a goal and an assist. However, the control United had was lost when he came off. The Brazilian has come a long way from that night at Selhurst Park, becoming an indispensable player who apparently can’t miss any minutes whatsoever.",
      "His goal was an outstanding back-post header from a Bruno Fernandes free-kick following a Jorge Cuenca shirt-pull on Matheus Cunha, which United initially thought was going to be a penalty after Cuenca’s sliding tackle on Cunha. The replays suggested a goal kick was more likely, and we’re sure Marco Silva will have something very interesting to say.",
      "Goal contributions aside, it was a commanding midfield performance from Casemiro. He and Mainoo provide a lovely balance in the middle of the park, and with Bruno Fernandes in front of them? Chef’s kiss.",
      "For Carrick, it has genuinely been a case of playing your best players in their best positions and standing in the technical area with your hands behind your back as a well-functioning XI do their thing. And from now on, he will play his best players for even longer. Amazingly, that is a better idea than bringing on Manuel Ugarte.",
      "While it was a scare for United and could have prompted a very different reaction from us, Carrick’s perfect start continued. It was comfortable for the most part against weaker opposition in good form, which tells us more about Carrick and United’s credentials than wins against the Premier League’s top two, especially when these were the fixtures the previous manager struggled with most.",
      "It’s two wins from two at Old Trafford and an away win against the league leaders, who hadn’t lost at home all season before United’s brilliant 3-2 victory. That also happened to be the first time Arsenal and their rock-solid defence have conceded three goals in a match since December 2023.",
      "Two whole calendar years without conceding three goals in a game is quite something. For all the talk of Arsenal capitulating, Carrick deserves huge credit for that victory, not just the brilliant start he has made.",
      "Aston Villa might want to look over their shoulder as Carrick’s United soar. The players look confident and settled. Everyone is contributing. The partnerships are working well all over the pitch. For once, it actually looks like a football team enjoying themselves and a group of players who genuinely like each other.",

It was criminal that Slot dropped him as soon as Isak was fit; that decision also coincided with our horrendous down turn in form but I suspect that correlation rather than causation. If he were to do so again then I think fans would riot. Hugo has earned that spot right now and it should be his to keep; everyone else in this team needs to find a place around him in my opinion.",
      "The Mo drop off is so sad to watch and so hard to understand. He was through and clear on goal and forgot to curve his run to bring him closer to goal. In the end Trippier just took it off him. Is he fully devoid of confidence or just downing tools until Slot is gone? His lack of output combined with Gakpo is probably why we have struggled so much this season. Today Gakpo had these flashes driving into space but then had zero output or clue of what to do every time. He seems so out of sync with the team; once he raced into the box and then to the byline and crossed it at chest level for a defender to clear when he could’ve rolled it on the floor two touches earlier into feet for a finish.",

      "“There is truth to Cole Palmer being unsettled in his position at Chelsea,” Castles explained on The Transfers Podcast.",
      "“I talked to a couple of sports directors. One in particular, I asked him, ‘Have you been offered Cole Palmer?’ His answer was, ‘Everyone has been offered Cole Palmer!’",
      "“His understanding of the situation was that Palmer is not happy that he is no longer necessarily the central creative force in the Chelsea squad because of Estevao’s arrival from Brazil, because of Estevao’s initial impact at Chelsea.",
      "“He wants to be reassured that he is the most important creative force there.",
      "“And that has resulted, it seems, in his representatives going around the elite clubs of Europe and indicating to them that Palmer could be interested in a move and asking whether they would be interested in taking him.",
      "“Now, that doesn’t mean that Palmer will leave Chelsea in the summer window, certainly not in the January window.",
      "“But it does mean that we can expect some movement there, and it does mean that he is certainly trying to create some leverage in his discussions with Chelsea, in his apparent desire to be reinstated as that key figure he was at Chelsea before Estevao arrived.”",

      "Here, thanks to football analysis experts Gradient Sports, we present the best shotstoppers in the Premier League.",
      "Across a vast range of metrics, Gradient grades every player out of 100, measuring execution and outcome to offer the most insightful and accurate view of individual performance.",
      "This is especially useful when it comes to judging keepers, rather than assessing them on clean sheets or simple shots-saved percentage.",
      "So, according to the grades, here are the Premier League stoppers (who have started a minimum of five matches) ranked for their shot-stopping prowess…",
      "The Argentina keeper has had a somewhat erratic season so far but Martinez has still saved 75% of the shots on target he has faced – better than any other Premier League regular.",
      "Dubravka was an inspired summer signing and without him, Burnley would be further adrift. The 37-year-old has been the busiest keeper, facing 32 shots on target more than anyone else.",
      "Much to the disgust of James Trafford, Pep Guardiola changed tack completely and brought in a big guy to guard his goal. Donnarumma has the lowest saveable goals conceded with 15.8%.",
      "The giant Georgian just scrapes in having played five games when Alisson was injured and Liverpool were caving in after a flying start. Apparently, half of the 10 goals Mamardashvili conceded were saveable, but he performed above expectation on a third of the shots he saved.",
      "Areola has come under criticism having initially been dropped to the bench at the start of the season but there are signs he is starting to recover some reliability during the Hammers’ recent upturn in form. Which won’t be a coincidence.",
      "Dispatched back to the bench recently, which seems harsh, according to the numbers. Maybe Spurs’ bench is comfier.",
      "Raya has faced 52 shots on target, at least a dozen fewer than any other regular No.1, considerably fewer than any other keeper, but the fact the Spaniard is fifth for shots saved above expectation indicates he has been a reliable presence when called upon.",
      "A very mixed season for Sels after sharing the Golden Glove last term. Sean Dyche toyed with replacing the Belgian but Big John blew it.",
      "You can’t blame Vicario for looking unsettled behind that Spurs side but he has been caught up in the chaos too often, even if the stats suggest he remains one the Premier League’s better shotstoppers.",
      "The numbers suggest Pickford has been something of a contradiction. He has made the third-highest number of big saves and is fifth for shots on target saved, but he has conceded the second-highest number of saveable goals (14). Still England’s No.1.",
      "The Netherlands No.1 continues to catch eyes, with Bayern Munich and Tottenham both credited with an interest in the Seagulls stopper. Scrapes into the Premier League power rankings top 30.",
      "A very middle-of-the-road season so far from Henderson, who needed his best yet if he hoped to dislodge Pickford in the England goal in time for the World Cup. May get plenty of opportunities to impress before then since Palace have sold their captain and best defender.",
      "MORE PREM RANKINGS: Best passers under pressure | Most tackle-proof players",
      "May have felt aggrieved to give up the gloves when Lucas Perri returned but Darlow is rightfully back in the Leeds goal. Not because he’s demonstrably better, rather he’s certainly no worse.",
      "There have been occasions this season when Leno was less than his usual reliable self, evidenced by the fact that no keeper has conceded more saveable goals (16).",
      "Anything less chaotic than Andre Onana was always going to make a huge difference to United and Lammens has been a calming, reliable presence. A top-class keeper? We’ll see…",
      "The Brentford stopper was conceding too many goals that perhaps he shouldn’t at the start of the season while settling into his first job as a No.1, but Kelleher looks more at ease in the role now.",
      "Petrovic, like Bournemouth collectively, began the season well but had a major wobble at the back end of the 2025.",
      "Performed slightly better than Pope but not enough to make Eddie Howe consider a permanent change.",
      "Hasn’t been consistent enough to silence the doubters, and the fact Liam Rosenior admits he is asking Sanchez to do things that may be unfamiliar with suggests Chelsea will be looking for a new keeper in the summer. There’s a good one going free in Italy.",
      "Below Ramsdale for shotstopping here, but many Newcastle fans were happy to see Pope return upon return from injury.",
      "Don’t shoot the messenger, Sunderland fans. We agree, Roefs has been superb.",
      "Alisson is usually a rock-solid presence for Liverpool but the Brazilian, not long ago viewed by many as the world’s best, has struggled to stop the Reds’ rot. Is it time to give Mamardashvili a longer run?",
      "Initially taken out of the firing line because of injury, then dropped after a series of soft goals culminating in the latest-ever Premier League winner.",
      "Dropped, then restored to the Wolves XI, though these numbers would query Rob Edwards’ logic."

      "Man Utd won't U-turn on the decision to allow Casemiro to leave when his contract expires in June despite improved Premier League form under Michael Carrick; the club are forward planning and expected to chase a number of midfield targets in the summer, with Elliot Anderson top of list",
      "Monday 2 February 2026 15:50, UK",
      "Manchester United midfielder Casemiro is in his richest vein of form since arriving at Old Trafford in a deal worth £70m in 2022. So why would the club let him go now?",
      "The veteran Brazil international, who turns 34 later this month, rolled back the years as Man Utd picked up another dramatic win over Fulham on Sunday, heading in the opener before setting up Matheus Cunha's goal with a sublime no-look pass.",
      "Casemiro has started all three games under Carrick, but made his impending departure official last month while Ruben Amorim was still in charge. United did hold the option to trigger a 12-month extension, but with a midfield overhaul planned for the summer it was decided that Casemiro would be allowed to leave.",
      "\"Manchester United are determined not to have a short-term approach to signings and managers. That's what has got them into trouble in the past. It's left a lot of big-name players on big wages who are not part of the plans.",
      "\"Casemiro is flying right now. Player of the match against Fulham. I can understand why a lot of fans are saying: 'we're trying to find a midfielder but willing to let Casemiro go?'",
      "\"He turns 34 later this month, he's one of the biggest earners at the club, £325k a week, and Man Utd know that can't go on forever. He's playing out of his skin right now but they have to have a longer-term plan.",
      "\"Casemiro will leave in the summer, they have done the big goodbye video and there is no going back on that.\"",
      "\"I think it is. He has done brilliantly well, playing with Kobbie Mainoo and Bruno Fernandes in there makes a difference.",
      "\"He's got to move on. He's 34 and before you know it, he's 35. He's been a top player; he's had a lot of unworthy stick because he hasn't got the legs to play on his own in midfield if Fernandes pushes forward.",
      "\"Mainoo has helped that a lot - common sense by Michael Carrick. But we're talking about the future of Man Utd and they are right to be doing what they're doing and letting him go.\"",
      "\"Midfield is where Man Utd feel they will focus the bulk of their spend in the summer.",
      "\"Carlos Baleba at Brighton is on their list, Elliot Anderson at Nottingham Forest, they like Adam Wharton, and Joao Gomes at Wolves so there's a number of options. They may even do two.",
      "\"Window by window, they are prioritising areas of the team. It's a very data-led approach. Last summer the priority was to score more goals so that's why they pumped £280m into three forward players.",
      "\"Now they are wanting to solve the next imbalance and are going to address midfield. I get the impression Anderson is top of the list but we're talking over £100m.\"",
      "The logic here is obvious. Casemiro is an aging midfielder, whose stamina has been questioned repeatedly over the past 18 months. Perhaps some of the blame lies at the door of previous manager Ruben Amorim, as it was clear to most that Casemiro no longer had the legs to be the heart of the engine room. The rebalance with Kobbie Mainoo has proved invaluable.",
      "Clearly, he's still got plenty to offer Man Utd between now and the end of the season, though. Maybe beyond. But time is against him and a recalibration of the wage bill is necessary if the club want to chase top targets in the summer.",
      "Nevertheless, Casemiro's worth can still be underlined by his numbers. He's scored as many goals as Fernandes (five) in the Premier League this season - also equal to Benjamin Sesko. His aerial ability makes him a huge threat from set-pieces, with four of those goals headers.",
      "Defensively he's made the most tackles (52) of any Man Utd player and recovered the second-most possessions in midfield (51), behind Fernandes. His duels won (107) can only be bettered by Patrick Dorgu. And his quality on the ball is undeniable.",
      "This latest upturn will ensure he gets a big send-off in May. But before then, he's proving a highly resourceful and reliable asset for Carrick to call upon.",

      "Going into the window, the feeling was Arsenal were going to be quiet. And so it proved.",
      "They did their business in the summer - and were only likely to dip into the market if a long-term target or unique market opportunity presented itself.",
      "Manager Mikel Arteta maintained they would be alive and alert.",
      "However, he also called for the numbers in a matchday squad to be increased in line with Europe. He is begging for 23 in total - and 20 outfield players. The reason? He is having to disappoint two or three players every game.",
      "With that in mind, the chance of a new signing was always going to be slim.",

      "Thoughts will no doubt switch to the summer when Arsenal are expected to be busy again.",
      "With the challenges presented by complying with the Premier League and UEFA's financial rules still very pertinent for Aston Villa they perhaps did as much as they could this January to remain competitive on three fronts in the coming months.",
      "Douglas Luiz has a lot of work to do to cover for the absence of injured trio John McGinn, Boubacar Kamara and Youri Tielemans for the foreseeable future, but at least he knows Unai Emery's system.",
      "Tammy Abraham knows the club and is a more natural central striker than Donyel Malen, who left to join Roma. Returning from Rome is Leon Bailey who feels a better option than Evan Guessand, who underwhelmed after his summer arrival.",
      "Emery's brilliance probably holds the key to Villa holding off the challenge from behind in the league and ending a 30-year wait for silverware.",
      "This was always going to be a tough transfer window for Bournemouth to navigate with the anticipated departure of Antoine Semenyo due to his release clause. However, with the arrival of four new faces for Andoni Iraola, this window will be seen as a success.",
      "The injury to Justin Kluivert around the same time as Semenyo left for Man City only added to the sense that this would be a pivotal period for the Cherries. Results were mixed and the club were flirting with slipping into the relegation battle. It all felt a bit worrying.",
      "How different the picture looks now though. Unbeaten in five games and 13 points clear of the bottom three, Bournemouth can comfortably look up the table rather than over their shoulder and the early signs are that their latest recruits could be hits.",
      "Brazilian teenager Rayan, the potential Semenyo replacement, set up Bournemouth's second goal in Saturday's 2-0 win at Wolves in his debut following £30.3m move from Vasco da Gama. Bournemouth will be glad he has a release clause of £86.3m in his contract.",
      "The signing of midfielder Alex Toth from Ferencvaros was another coup. Lazio, Benfica and Galatasary were all chasing the 20-year-old, who was developed at the Hungarian club by head coach Robbie Keane, and he comes with experience of pressure environments.",
      "Bournemouth have also brought in goalkeeper Christos Mandas from Lazio to provide competition for Djordje Petrovic in a move that could become permanent in the summer. Left back Ade Solanke, 18, is seen as one for the future after signing from Lorient.",
      "There was hope at one point of adding a fifth signing. Inter's Luis Henrique was one of those that Bournemouth looked at but because of the club being in such a comfortable position there was no desire to force a move at an inflated price late in the window.",
      "Brentford's impressive form this season meant they could stay measured in this window. Their league position is a reflection of the great work they have done in previous windows.",
      "They had wanted to add a young centre-forward prospect for some time and Kaye Furo becomes that player, now learning under former Club Brugge team-mate Igor Thiago.",
      "They also kept hold of some key players in Kristoffer Ajer and Vitaly Janelt. Both have signed new deals after uncertainty around their futures and interest from other clubs.",
      "There may have been some further changes in defence but nothing really materalised for Ethan Pinnock in the end, meaning no replacement was needed.",
      "It started with a bang but arguably ended with a bit of a whimper.",
      "Brighton's window started in spectacular fashion with the return of club legend Pascal Gross early on. The re-signing of the Germany international for a fee of £1.2m from Borussia Dortmund is already starting to pay dividends. His experience will be key and is sure to rub off on the many young players in the squad.",
      "Matt O'Riley is another player to return to the club albeit in different circumstances. The midfielder's loan from Marseille was ended early and becomes another option for head coach Fabian Hurzeler. With appearances in the Champions League for the French club this season, the former Celtic man comes back a better player.",
      "The 25-year-old's return to Brighton was confirmed on the final day of the window. Perhaps there was a hope amongst some of the support in certain quarters that there would be more arrivals.",
      "Should a striker have come in to ease the pressure on 35-year-old Danny Welbeck and 18-year-old Charalampos Kostoulas up front? Evan Ferguson's possible return from a loan spell at Roma was often a topic of discussion but he is staying in Italy.",
      "Has Tommy Watson's loan move to Millwall for the rest of the season left Brighton light in terms of back-up wingers? Brajan Gruda has moved to Leipzig on loan too.",
      "Brighton tend not to do too much business in January - they are calm, not reactive and spend much of it looking at forward planning. Much work would have been done behind the scenes for the summer window. Expect a fair bit of movement in and out then.",
      "Worth a reminder that one of their best signings this window might not be a player but one behind the scenes. Mike Anthony, who was high performance chief at the All Blacks, came in to take a newly created role as the club's head of player development and high performance in what they feel is an innovative move focused on culture and mentality.",
      "Signing James Ward-Prowse, a player with a proven track record in the Premier League, from a relegation rival no less, will certainly be seen as a smart signing by Scott Parker.",
      "Whether that will be enough to surmount the overwhelming challenge Burnley face in terms of keeping themselves in the Premier League remains to be seen.",
      "At one stage, it looked as if Ward-Prowse's move from West Ham would not happen. At least they managed to get this one over the line.",
      "Whatever Burnley did in this window, they were always facing an unenviable task to stay in the Premier League.",
      "Chelsea are usually big spenders in transfer windows but this turned out to be a quiet month by Stamford Bridge standards.",
      "They missed out on their No. 1 target Jeremy Jacquet. Liverpool got him at the last minute after Chelsea were confident that he would choose them ahead of other interested clubs.",
      "It's debatable whether Chelsea needed another centre back, especially with Levi Colwill due back from injury before the end of the season and promising young defenders out on loan.",
      "One of them - Mamadou Sarr - is coming back from sister club Strasbourg and he is expected to challenge for a first-team place straightaway.",
      "This window officially marked the end of Chelsea's so-called Bomb Squad. Raheem Sterling's contract was terminated and Axel Disasi joined West Ham on loan.",
      "It's been some start to the year for Crystal Palace.",
      "They smashed their transfer record to sign Brennan Johnson from Spurs. Their FA Cup defence collapsed at the first attempt against non-League Macclesfield Town. Days later, their manager Oliver Glasner confirmed he'd be heading off in the summer just moments after revealing that club captain Marc Guehi was set to be sold.",
      "On the pitch, the winless run continued as a season filled with promise began to unravel. Reinforcements were forthcoming as the future of their top scorer Jean-Philippe Mateta became more and more uncertain. Long-term target Evann Guessand was signed in a try-before-you-buy loan deal from Aston Villa as Palace threatened to commit more than £100m in incomings in the winter window.",
      "As ever, all roads pointed towards a busy Deadline Day. Jorgen Strand Larsen was lined up as a replacement for Mateta. But the wantaway Frenchmen didn't get the Italian Job done.",
      "It seemed implausible that Palace would end the season with two frontline strikers but they deserve credit for ploughing ahead with the deal for Strand Larsen despite the late collapse of Mateta's move to Milan.",
      "It's a calculated gamble from Steve Parish. They have added firepower up front. They have failed to replace their captain but left no stone unturned in their attempt to sign a central defender for a fair market price.",
      "It's now imperative Palace immediately quell any doubts surrounding their Premier League status and then press forward in achieving a successful finish. A rollercoaster season could still culminate in European glory.",
      "David Moyes had been pretty clear in his expectations that this window and Deadline Day was not going to be spectacular.",
      "Only a few weeks ago he said to me how welcome an approach it is given the spending of the past which caused Everton so much harm in the long run.",
      "So, a quiet window ended with what should be seen as sensible business.",
      "In Tyrique George they are getting the chance to have a look at a 19 year old who joins on loan until the end of the season, before deciding whether or not to take up their option to buy.",
      "There was interest in George from another premier league club and one in Europe, who was close to a £22m move to Fulham in the summer. And he arrives at Everton having scored three goals in 11 Chelsea appearances this season, including in the Champions League at home to Ajax.",
      "In total he's made 37 appearances for Chelsea including one Premier league start. While his only Premier League goal came last season as he kick started the comeback win at Fulham.",
      "Given the injury to Jack Grealish, George will be hopeful David Moyes can offer him greater playing time.",
      "The Everton boss will have also Dwight McNeil to call on for the remainder of the season out wide after his move to Crystal Palace collpased after the deadline had passed. A deal sheet was submitted but the relevant paperwork was not done in time.",
      "At the obligation price of £20m it was a difficult offer for Everton to say no to. But having another more experienced wide player to support youngsters George and Tyler Dibling could prove valuable for Moyes.",
      "Deadline Day at Fulham started with a great deal of promise but ultimately failed to deliver. The club were hopeful they could get a deal done for Riccardo Pepi, the PSV Eindhoven striker.",
      "The club had reached an agreement on a £32m package, but that was on the proviso that PSV could find a replacement. They were unable to do so and therefore the deal fell through.",
      "Fulham do however still hope to pick it back up in the summer. The 21-year-old Pepi is a long-term target and a long-term successor to Raul Jimenez.",
      "Harry Wilson was also in the headlines early on Deadline Day. It emerged Everton had made an approach for him last week - unsurprisingly it was rejected by Fulham. Marco Silva has repeatedly said Wilson is going nowhere in this window.",
      "So, Fulham's January business saw a 30-year-old winger, Adame Traore, leave the club and a 22-year-old winger, Oscar Bobb, arrive.",
      "Slim business, yes - but if Bobb can stay fit and fulfill his potential you have to say potentially very good business too.",
      "Leeds United reach the end of another transfer window with an overwhelming sense of what could have been after missing out on Jorgen Strand Larsen to Crystal Palace.",
      "This was never supposed to be a big window for Daniel Farke's side and loan signings were always thought to be more likely than permanent deals. That is how things panned out in the end with Facundo Buonanotte, a loan from Brighton, the only incoming for Leeds.",
      "The Argentina international playmaker adds a creative profile to the squad that was lacking, but it remains to be seen if he can cut it at Premier League level after struggling to consistently keep his place in the team at Brighton and Leicester.",
      "Expectations were low coming into the window, but the pursuit of Strand Larsen raised hopes. Leeds were unwilling to go above £40m - Wolves' initial valuation for the striker - and Palace ended up committing to £8m more than that.",
      "For a club that said they were maxing out PSR after the summer, there was no further that Leeds could stretch to make this deal happen. So why did some of those funds not go towards improving other areas of the squad?",
      "Leeds were planning to structure most of the deal to come out of next year's budget to stay within Premier League rules. Strand Larsen was also viewed as a unique opportunity and players like that do not often become available in mid-season windows.",
      "At a time when there is uncertainty in the goalkeeping department and injuries at full-back, it has been received by some fans as a gamble not to invest more in the squad to give Leeds the best chance of Premier League survival.",
      "We have been here before, though, with Leeds. In the summer, deals for the likes of Igor Paixao failed to materialise, and there were concerns that this squad did not have what it takes to cope with the Premier League. So far, they have defied those expectations.",
      "The true test will be in May. If Leeds stay up, none of this matters, but if they go down then perhaps the club will look back on this window as a missed opportunity to strengthen. Only time will tell.",
      "After a record breaking spend in the summer, this was a window in which Liverpool were never going to go wild. At the same time, having missed out on Marc Guehi on the final day of the summer window when Crystal Palace pulled the plug, to then lose him to Manchester City was a major blow.",
      "Ultimately the whole package didn't make financial sense, which was disappointing given how open to the move Guehi had been in the summer and the fact that Liverpool's interest had never waned, particularly as they saw him as someone who is not only one of the Premier League's centre backs but can also cover at right back.",
      "Liverpool's need for defensive reinforcements was emphasised by injuries to Joe Gomez, Jeremie Frimpong and Conor Bradley all adding to the long term absence of Geovanni Leoni.",
      "Ultimately, a deal for Lutsharel Geertruida proved impossible as Sunderland were not in a position to sanction the move despite the player himself wanting to make the switch.",
      "It all meant that discussions with Spurs over a £5m move for Andy Robertson were short-lived as it would have made little sense for Liverpool to weaken their defensive options further. Similarly, Inter Milan's interest in Curtis Jones was swiftly rebuffed.",
      "Liverpool, though, have started the reshaping of their backline. Jeremy Jacquet completed a medical before finalising a deal that could see Liverpool pay Rennes up to £60m for the 20-year-old centre half. However, he will only become a Liverpool player in the summer, and will play out the rest of the season with Rennes hoping to deliver European football.",
      "Unlike the Guehi situation, Liverpool have headed off interest from other clubs, most notably Chelsea, with Jacquet believing he'll get more game time at Anfield. For the rest of this season though, it's a case of as you were when it comes to the makeup of this current Liverpool squad.",
      "Manchester City arguably stole the show this window by swooping in ahead of Liverpool and other top clubs for Antione Semenyo and Marc Guehi.",
      "They have made two important additions ahead of the summer in key positions and signed Premier League ready players who have already hit the ground running.",
      "A solution has also been found, finally, for Kalvin Phillips who joins Sheffield United on loan until the summer.",
      "Sverre Nypan returns from a loan at Middlesbrough to integrate into the first-team, while a number of other youngsters head out on loan for more game time.",
      "As expected, it was overall a quiet window in the January transfer window for Manchester United.",
      "Entering the window, there was uncertainty amongst a few players such as the likes of Kobbie Mainoo, Manuel Ugarte and Joshua Zirkzee.",
      "But none of those situations for different reasons ended up in departures - and perhaps the reason why is because the biggest outgoing of the window for the club was United's former head coach Ruben Amorim and the most impactful incoming was his replacement Michael Carrick after leading them to three huge wins in the last three weeks.",
      "The change has seen United start Kobbie Mainoo start and star three league games in a row which has put questions around his future on hold for now.",
      "However with no reinforcements, all attention for United will be on the summer window as they look to reshape their midfield, especially with Casemiro leaving the club at the end of his contract this summer as well.",
      "They resisted the temptation to reinforce this window and refused to compromise on their long-term targets but all eyes will be on United's hierarchy this summer - especially when it is still uncertain who will be the head coach going into next season.",
      "Newcastle failed to make a January signing, much to the frustration of their fanbase.",
      "With a relentless fixture schedule that sees them currently play a game every three days, a fresh face would have given everyone a lift. Eddie Howe has previously gone on record to say he'd like to sign at least one new player every window.",
      "In truth though, Newcastle are still counting the cost of a summer splurge that saw them spend £250m. The jury is still out on a few of those new faces as Eddie Howe attempts to knit a new team together without the player they were all there to serve - Alexander Isak. It all feels very much a work in progress.",
      "The biggest move of Deadline Day was club captain Jamaal Lascelles moving to Leicester City after 12 long years with the club.",
      "The team as a whole are doing okay despite the distractions and residual damage of last summer, and are still in four competitions.",
      "But when it comes to new faces they'll keep their powder dry until the summer as they look to strengthen significantly then.",
      "It won't all go their way, as it again looks as though they'll have to brace themselves for further attempts from competitors to sign their best players. Sandro Tonali and Tino Livramento are two that continually get linked with moves away.",
      "But for now, it's batten down the hatches and get through until the end of the season.",
      "Nottingham Forest had a frustrating end to the window but covered most positions they wanted filling.",
      "There will be lots of focus on their failed bids for Arne Engels and Jean-Phillippe Mateta but both would have been bonus signings.",
      "Luca Netz was brought in for a pittance by Premier League standards to offer competition at left-back, Lorenzo Lucca offers another striking threat with Chris Wood out and Stefan Ortega's arrival was timely after an injury to 'keeper Matz Sels.",
      "Long-term targets will be chased in the summer but Elliot Anderson's future will be the main story at the City Ground at the end of the season.",
      "It was a significantly quieter transfer window for Sunderland than what we saw in the summer when 14 new arrivals cost around £150m.",
      "That was a necessity back then, but the need for mass change has been reduced due to Sunderland's impressive start to the season that sees them unbeaten at home and lying mid-table.",
      "The one big signing arrived on Deadline Day - Nilson Angulo from Anderlecht. The winger has signed for £15m, with a potential £2.5m in addition in add-ons.",
      "It was left very late, and reliant on outcast Adil Aouchiche freeing up a loan spot by cutting his deal at Aberdeen short and moving to Schalke. That loan spot was the taken by Simon Adingra who joined Monaco on loan, and allowed Sunderland to sign Angulo permanently.",
      "Confused? It's never dull on Deadline Day. Sporting director Florent Ghisolfi can be very creative.",
      "Liverpool tried to make it more confusing by attempting to sign Lutsharel Geertruida over the weekend. But due to the complexity of the deal (The Dutchman is on a season-long loan from RB Leipzig) Sunderland refused to sanction it.",
      "There were a number of January departures from The Stadium of Light. The most notable one being former captain Dan Neil, who led the club promotion to the Premier League. He was never given a chance by Regis Le Bris in the top flight, but now has the chance for back-to-back promotions with Ipswich",
      "Tottenham end the window with Thomas Frank's squad looking short amid an injury crisis despite the arrivals of midfielder Conor Gallagher and left-back Souza. Failure to bring in a forward after injuries to Richarlison and Mohammed Kudus is the big shortcoming for Spurs.",
      "The club did not want to be reactive to their situation and panic buy. January is a notoriously hard window to do business in and top players rarely become available. Every effort was put into trying to sign Antoine Semenyo, but he chose to join Manchester City.",
      "Spurs also tried to sign Andy Robertson to inject some much-needed experience into the side and provide cover for the injured Ben Davies. However, it proved too difficult for Liverpool to recall Kostas Tsimikas from his loan at Roma and the deal could not be done.",
      "Randal Kolo Muani, Mathys Tel, Radu Dragusin and Antonin Kinsky all attracted interest in this window but Spurs could not sanction their exits with all their injury issues. They have all struggled for game time this season but there is an opportunity now to prove themselves.",
      "Spurs have big plans to strengthen in the summer transfer window. Frank will hope he gets the time to reap the benefits of that. The spirited fight-back in the draw against Man City suggests he has the backing of the players, but a lot is being asked of this depleted group.",
      "Frank and his employers must hope that they have enough to rise to the occasion and restore some consistency for Spurs. Otherwise, the increasingly frustrated fanbase may run out of patience with the lack of support they have been given.",
      "West Ham made a fast start to the transfer window and a slow-ish end.",
      "Taty Castellanos and Pablo coming in within five days of January strengthened the attack. Adama Traore coming in towards the end adds pace and unpredictability into the squad.",
      "Nuno Espírito Santo constantly talked about rebalancing the squad during the winter window. I can't quite work out if he has so I'll be interested to get his answer when I speak to him on Thursday. Apart from Lucas Paqueta, no key players have left. And the Lucas Paqueta we've seen this season can't be described as key.",
      "Players who weren't playing minutes are gone. Igor Julio, James Ward-Prowse, Guido Rodriguez and Andy Irving are out. Axel Disasi signing on the final day offers needed cover.",
      "Are West Ham stronger now than compared to the start of the window? I would say just. Pablo and Castellanos as a pair seems to be working up front but if that starts to slow down, the window starts to look very different.",
      "Wolves' window has been more about outgoings than incomings, as the club looks increasingly likely to be relegated at the end of the season.",
      "They have sold arguably their best forward in Jorgen Strand Larsen to Crystal Palace for £48m, which has to be seen as trying to extract maximum value for a player out of form.",
      "In turn the club have been looking to get ready for a medium term that may involve a season at least in the Championship, and the additions of Adam Armstrong and Angel Gomes add know-how and quality.",
      "It is a shame they did not also add Che Adams - a long-term target - to their thanks despite trying with Torino right until the final day.",
      "Tough times ahead for Wolves indeed but the money from Strand Larsen gives them more to spend in the summer and with time to plan for the market.",

      "After impressively beating Arsenal and Manchester City, Carrick's United passed another test that had its fair share of refereeing controversy.",
      "The first incident came in the build-up to Man Utd's opener as they were initially awarded a penalty after Matheus Cunha was judged to have been brought down by Jorge Cuenca. However, after a VAR check, the decision was overturned, with Cuenca clearly winning the ball, although the hosts were given a free-kick for a shirt pull instead - much to Marco Silva's fury.",
      "Manchester United were awarded a penalty for a trip by Jorge Cuenca on Matheus Cunha. However, a VAR review showed Cuenca won the ball - but a free-kick was given for the defender pulling Cunha's shirt outside the box.",
      "In that case, the VAR could intervene by declaring the decision a factual error and award a free-kick instead.",
      "From the resulting free-kick, Casemiro headed home a Bruno Fernandes delivery for his fifth of the campaign. After announcing his departure at the end of the season, the midfielder is enjoying a farewell tour.",
      "Cunha, who made a return to the starting line-up in the only change to the side in place of the injured Patrick Dorgu, thundered in to double Man Utd's advantage in the second half.",
      "Fulham thought they had pulled one back when Cuenca tapped in a deflected Samuel Chukwueze shot that fell kindly into his path. However, after a VAR check that lasted around four minutes, the goal was ruled out for a marginal offside.",
      "But after being brought down by Harry Maguire in the area, Jimenez scored from the spot, before Kevin's stunning equaliser looked like it had rescued a point for Marco Silva's side.",
      "But Sesko, set up by Fernandes, had different ideas, thumping in his fifth goal of the season. A resurgent Man Utd are now five points off third place in the Premier League. Fulham drop to eighth.",

      "It was easy street for Man City in the first half. They didn't need to get out of first gear at Spurs. The problem was they stayed there for the rest of the game.",
      "There's been a common theme regarding Pep Guardiola's teams and that is slow second halves after being 2-0 up.",
      "Against Wolves, Joao Gomes and Jorgen Strand Larsen should have pulled a goal back for the league's bottom side but missed chances. Victor Osimhen should have scored once or twice for Galatasaray in midweek. This dip at Spurs was one too many - and it felt similar to the two second-half goals conceded in the Manchester derby",
      "Guardiola said his City team suffered emotionally after the injustice of Dominic Solanke's first goal standing due to the Marc Guehi collision. Duels were missed, particularly out wide with the full-backs, he said - and it was seen in the equaliser as Nico O'Reilly and Nico Gonzalez got mixed up.",
      "And then the excuses from Guardiola start to come. Blaming the Guehi-Solanke incident follows similar complaints about not getting a penalty against Wolves and Diogo Dalot staying on the pitch in the Manchester derby. The reality is City have been struggling in the most important parts of matches.",
      "Is it a physical issue, with injuries catching up on them? Is it too many new players over the last 12 months? It all acts as a reminder that this is not a Manchester City of years gone by. How many times in the past would a Guardiola team kill a game off early and sit on a lead, maybe push for more?",
      "They need a fix to this second-half issue quickly, as it's Liverpool up next in the Premier League. The gap to Arsenal cannot afford to get bigger.Sam Blitz",
      "Casemiro is just one goal from matching his return from his best goalscoring season in a league campaign.",
      "He's very much on his farewell tour, after announcing he will depart at the end of the season and he's rolled back the years under Michael Carrick.",
      "His opening goal set the tone and his no-look assist to set up Matheus Cunha was reflective of the confidence he's playing with. Carrick noted the \"presence\" he has been since he took over as interim coach and how his experience has been significant.",
      "A five-time Champions League winner, his reputation has taken a hit since arriving on these shores; however, the Brazil international has maintained the favour of his coaches.",
      "As he approaches his 34th birthday, any suggestion that he should have been a part of Man Utd's plans beyond this season are misguided. But on the flip side, alongside Kobbie Mainoo, he remains an important cog in Carrick's machine.",
      "Casemiro is often profiled as the anchor in midfield and that owes to his time at Real Madrid, where he was the proverbial water carrier for Toni Kroos and Luka Modric.",
      "However, for Manchester United, he's proving to be much more of a complete package, showing a willingness to break lines with forward passes, hence his seven into the final third against Fulham.",
      "Beyond the goal contributions, suddenly, Casemiro appears to be a player United can once again rely on. It's a call back to the player signed from Real in a deal worth £70m in 2022.",
      "There's been a lot of talk about United's reported midfield overhaul this summer but the hole Casemiro is going to leave and the boots that will need to be filled grow every passing day.William Bitibiri",
      "In his pre-match press conference ahead of the game against Manchester City, Thomas Frank said Xavi Simons needed to translate his Champions League performances domestically. He certainly did that.",
      "The Dutchman was the biggest beneficiary of the 3-4-3 system that was forced to turn to due to the injuries that have plagued the squad. With the wide wing-backs pushing up, it gave Simons ample space inside to operate in areas he is dangerous in.",
      "More often than not, he was the go-to for Spurs as they transitioned from defence into attack. His neat footwork was at times a joy and his weight of pass was more often than not, exemplary.",
      "Having said that, the most impressive thing was his tenacity. He never gave up a fight for possession. He showed the grit needed in tough and physical Premier League games, and lived to tell the tale.",
      "This was somewhat of a coming our performance for Simons, whose quality was never questioned, but was a case of if it was suited to English football.",
      "In perhaps one of the most difficult games Spurs will have this season with regards to the pressure they are under and the opposition they found themselves against, an unsung hero stepped up and epitomised what Spurs' comeback was all about.Callum Bishop",
      "Morgan Gibbs-White was named man of the match as 10-man Nottingham Forest held Crystal Palace to a draw but Elliot Anderson was an equally deserving candidate.",
      "The 23-year-old showed all sides of his game in a complete performance which underlined, again, his status as one of the Premier League's top central midfielders.",
      "His best work came in possession in the first half as he demonstrated his technical ability and passing range, sending Forest forward on the attack repeatedly.",
      "He continued to show his on-ball value even after Neco Williams' sending-off. No Forest player had more touches or made more passes over the course of the 90 minutes. Anderson even completed all five of his attempted dribbles.",
      "But he was just as influential defensively after the break. Anderson snapped into challenges and played a crucial role in frustrating Palace, working tirelessly, cajoling and instructing team-mates.",
      "In total, he won possession 10 times, the highest total by any player on either side. He was also successful in 12 of his 14 duels. An outstanding all-round performance from a player getting better all the time.Nick Wright",
      "The draw against Nottingham Forest extended Crystal Palace's winless run to nine in the Premier League and 12 in all competitions. Shelbourne were the last team they beat, all the way back on December 11.",
      "But while that is miserable, arguably more concerning is their struggles in front of goal.",
      "Across those last 12, they have scored nine, with three scored from the penalty spot. That equates to a goal from open play every other game.",
      "Even with the absence of Jean-Philippe Mateta - who was left out of the squad owing to the speculation around his future - Palace should probably have put more than an Ismaila Sarr penalty past Matz Sels - and half-time replacement Angus Gunn. Their hosts were reduced to 10 after a mindless handball from Neco Williams.",
      "But despite having 74 per cent of the possession after the break, they just couldn't. In fact, in the second half, they recorded only 0.22 xG and did not even muster a single shot on target.",
      "Right now, Mateta's future remains up in the air ahead of Deadline Day, but Palace have had a bid for Jorgen Strand Larsen totalling £48m accepted by Wolves. Providing that deal goes through without a hitch, they will need him to be firing from the off.Dan Long",
      "Aston Villa welcomed Douglas Luiz and Tammy Abraham back to the club this week and the duo went straight into the starting line-up against Brentford.",
      "This wasn't a nod to their talents, although both looked bright in flashes. It was evidence of the strain Unai Emery's squad is currently under.",
      "Captain John McGinn and top goalscorer Ollie Watkins both watched on from the stands due to injury, with Boubacar Kamara and Youri Tielemans joining them on the sidelines.",
      "Club-record singing Amadou Onana also wasn't fit enough to feature, despite being named on the bench.",
      "The injury crisis continues to sweep the club and faltering against the 10 men of Brentford highlighted that lack of depth.",
      "Arsenal know more than anyone how injuries can impact a team pushing at the top of the table.",
      "A seven-point gap to Liverpool in sixth remains after this defeat but moving forward, Villa might need to pay closer attention to those behind them rather than Arsenal at the top.Patrick Rowe",

      "Our football betting expert Jones Knows provides his insight across the Premier League weekend.",
      "This is one of those prices that makes you stop, wash your face with cold water and check you're reading it correctly.",
      "Aston Villa to win at 21/20 with Sky Bet feels very generous considering what this team have been telling us for months.",
      "Since going winless in their opening five Premier League games, Villa have been nothing short of elite. They've taken 43 points from 18 matches, title-challenger output no doubt and no side in the division have collected more points over that period. That's not a short hot streak either. It's a sample of results to respect. It's sustained excellence.",
      "Brentford, meanwhile, remain a side you want to oppose on their travels. Only bottom club Wolves have suffered more away defeats in the Premier League this season (8). Home win.",
      "There is no better attacker of a set-piece in world football than Harry Maguire. And in a Premier League season where dead-ball situations are being mined relentlessly for goals, Maguire is going to get his feed soon enough.",
      "Back in the Manchester United starting XI, Maguire is playing with an authority that has shone brightly in the last two performances. That confidence can translate to when he ventures forward. Maguire's old-school dominance remains a potent betting weapon and the 7/1 with Sky Bet for him to score is worth jumping on.",
      "There's a strong whiff of needle about this one. There's lingering animosity in the air after the summer legal battles which ended in Forest replacing Palace in the Europa League and when you layer in the relegation context, emotions are likely to be running hot. That's usually when the card markets come alive.",
      "One match-up in particular looks primed to deliver.",
      "Neco Williams is expected to lock horns with Ismaila Sarr, and that's a tough afternoon for any full-back. Sarr is relentless in one-vs-one situations, drives straight at defenders and forces decisions at pace. The data is damning from a defensive perspective as Sarr has drawn 21 cards from opponents since the start of last season, with only Bruno Guimaraes responsible for more in the Premier League.",
      "Williams looks a bet material at 100/30 with Sky Bet to be carded in an edgy game.",
      "There's no escaping the strange relationship between these two. Spurs have won seven of the last 12 meetings and Pep Guardiola has lost more Premier League games against Tottenham (8) than any other opponent. On paper, that history screams Tottenham.",
      "And when you see Spurs at 100/30 with Sky Bet, the temptation is obvious. But Spurs at home remain impossible to trust.",
      "Instead of fighting the uncertainty, the smarter route is to isolate a player who can still profit from Spurs doing some things right and that's where Dominic Solanke to score at 11/4 with Sky Bet comes to the party.",
      "He's become something of a forgotten man, but Solanke is built to score in the Premier League. Goals in back-to-back games is a reminder of his talents.",
      "There's also a bigger-picture motivation edge at play. With England's forward depth in focus, Solanke knows he's fighting to be a potential Harry Kane understudy this summer for England at the World Cup.",
      "Sunderland remain the only Premier League team unbeaten at home this season. That is wild.",
      "But trends do snap and, in betting, timing when to step in to profit from such a run ending is a key weapon to use when trying to profit in this game. It's 19/5 with Sky Bet to end here - a price on a Burnley win that is too big to pass up.",
      "The absence of Granit Xhaka is pivotal. We saw exactly how fragile Sunderland can be without their midfield reference point in their worst performance of the season away at West Ham. Without Xhaka's control, leadership and ability to dictate tempo, Sunderland lost structure, lost composure and were far too easy to play through.",
      "Burnley need wins now. So their approach will be positive and the market is dangling a very juicy carrot towards us regarding their win prospects."

      "Michael Carrick will go for a third consecutive win as Man Utd head coach against Fulham on Super Sunday and goalkeeper Senne Lammens has a big role to play; The Radar column also reveals the passing stats that set Aston Villa's Ezri Konsa apart",
      "Sunday 1 February 2026 07:04, UK",
      "",
      "🔴 Lammens brings calm to Man Utd💪 Konsa's passing under pressure🔍 A player to watch this weekend",
      "Manchester United beat Arsenal last Sunday with the help of two moments of brilliance from Matheus Cunha and Patrick Dorgu. But their goalkeeper played his part too, albeit in typically understated style. Senne Lammens continues to impress.",
      "The 23-year-old, an £18m signing from Royal Antwerp, has looked good value ever since his debut in October, when he kept a clean sheet in a 2-0 win over Sunderland at Old Trafford, instantly bringing a level of calm Altay Bayindir and Andre Onana lacked.",
      "Certainly, it is what Manchester United needed, and Lammens has brought plenty more besides. The various ways in which he has improved the side were neatly outlined at the Emirates Stadium as he helped Michael Carrick make it two wins from two.",
      "Firstly, there were examples of his shot-stopping ability, most notably in the first half, when he produced an outstanding reflex save to push Martin Zubimendi's close-range header over the bar. He later got down smartly to deny Bukayo Saka at his near post.",
      "The underlying data shows that, excluding own goals, Lammens has conceded 21 goals from chances worth an expected total of 23.74 since his arrival in the Premier League, giving him a chunky positive differential of nearly three goals prevented across 15 games.",
      "It is a considerable improvement on Bayindir, whose shot-stopping is deemed to be one of his stronger attributes but who had a negative differential for goals prevented across his six starts in the early weeks of the season, according to the same data.",
      "Lammens has proved useful with his feet as well as his hands, particularly over long distances.",
      "He sent 33 of his 36 passes long against Arsenal, having sent 11 out of 13 long in the 2-0 win over Manchester City. Overall this season, Lammens has sent the fourth-highest percentage of passes long among Premier League goalkeepers at 66.15 per cent.",
      "The increased emphasis on directness is a welcome change given the issues United previously encountered when trying to play out from the back under Carrick's predecessor Ruben Amorim.",
      "Lammens' passes, which are usually struck with precision and travel with flat trajectories, serve several functions, allowing Manchester United to bypass their opponents' press and secure territory higher up the pitch by winning headers or second balls.",
      "At the Emirates Stadium, Lammens was able to drop his passes over the top of Arsenal's defensive line repeatedly, meaning Gabriel and William Saliba had to contend with aerial duels and off-the-ball runs in behind simultaneously, often while back-peddling.",
      "Despite his relative inexperience, Lammens has handled the step up to a role once described by Neville as the most difficult in football impressively. He has gone from facing Beerschot and Westerlo to Manchester City and Arsenal in the space of a year.",
      "He had, of course, demonstrated considerable potential in Belgium. But if there was one area of uncertainty coming to the Premier League, it was how he might handle the aerial side of things.",
      "\"The most important and most difficult thing, especially as a goalkeeper, is the set-pieces,\" he added to Neville in December. \"That's unique to England, the physicality. They try to block you, they make it as difficult as they can for you.\"",
      "Lammens was beaten from one such set-piece against Arsenal, unable to claim Saka's corner before it was prodded over the line by Mikel Merino. But he otherwise stood up to the challenge well, confidently commanding his box in difficult circumstances.",
      "In fact, he finished the game having made more catches and punches than any other goalkeeper against Arsenal all season. His combined total of six was the fourth-highest by a goalkeeper in any Premier League fixture so far this term.",
      "It all adds up to a level of security in goal that Manchester United have not had since the departure of David De Gea. Onana made three errors leading directly to goals last season in the Premier League, according to Opta. Lammens, by contrast, is yet to even make one leading to a shot.",
      "Quiet reliability does not generate many headlines. Lammens is a calm character off the pitch as well as on it. \"I understand I might come across as boring,\" he said in an interview in Belgium in October, \"but that's the goalkeeper I want to be.\"",
      "And it is exactly the goalkeeper Manchester United needed.",
      "Ezri Konsa's second-half introduction from the bench helped Aston Villa come from behind to beat Red Bull Salzburg in the Europa League on Thursday. The centre-back brought his usual composure on the ball, completing all but one of his 20 passes.",
      "His reliability in possession is one of many strengths and it applies even in challenging circumstances. In the Premier League this season, Konsa has completed 448 out of 492 passes when under high-intensity pressure, giving him a higher accuracy rate than any other player in the division at 91 per cent.",
      "The 28-year-old is having an outstanding season, pushing his claim to an England starting spot alongside Marc Guehi at this summer's World Cup, helped by a level of technical ability and press-resistance to match his quality defensively.",
      "The last column examined the striker situation at Arsenal as Gabriel Jesus, Viktor Gyokeres and the returning Kai Havertz vie for the No 9 shirt, and explained why the latter is still top dog.",
