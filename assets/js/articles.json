      "Jeremy Jacquet is closing in on a transfer to Liverpool(Image: Jean Catuffe, Getty Images)",
      "Liverpool transfer target Jeremy Jacquet has demonstrated the mentality that Anfield chiefs will be acquiring should they seal a deadline-day swoop for the defender. The Rennes star is edging closer to a late switch to Merseyside, with the Reds aiming to finalise a deal before the 7pm cut-off point before sending him back to the French top-flight outfit on loan for the rest of the campaign.",
      "The club have fended off interest from rivals including Chelsea and Manchester United and struck an initial £55million agreement with Rennes plus £5million in performance-related bonuses. Jacquet is understood to have been won over by the vision presented by Liverpool, with reports suggesting that he believes he will secure more opportunities at Anfield.",
      "If accurate, this wouldn't be the first occasion in his fledgling career that Jacquet has made playing time his priority. The youngster stepped down a division to join Ligue 2 outfit Clemert on loan in January 2024.",
      "Speaking to L'Equipe, via Ligue 1 last year, Jacquet discussed that choice. \"It was either stay at Rennes with little playing time or go and discover something new,\" he said.",
      "\"I chose minutes on the pitch - and it paid off.\"",
      "He was brought back in February last year, having racked up 24 appearances for the club. The 20-year-old has subsequently cemented himself as a first-team regular at Rennes, ahead of his anticipated deadline day transfer to Liverpool.",
      "\"When you're young, the most important thing is to play,\" he added regarding his loan decision. \"That came from me and my family. I didn't hesitate.",
      "\"It shows I'm confident in myself and ready to make sacrifices to reach my goals.\"",

      "FOLLOW OUR LIVERPOOL FB PAGE! Latest Reds news and more on our dedicated Facebook page",
      "He attributes his success so far to the values instilled in him by his family. \"I inherited respect and humility from them,\" he said.",
      "\"With that, it's impossible for me to act like someone who doesn't want to work.\"",
      "Jacquet has also given Liverpool fans a taste of what they can expect from him on the pitch. \"I'm calm on the ball, maybe I can look a bit nonchalant - but I'm focused,\" he explained.",
      "\"What defines me is playing out well, breaking lines with the right pass.\"",
      "He further added: \"The coach asks me to communicate more, to lead, to add a bit more aggression. I'm working on finding the right balance.\"",
      "If the transfer goes through, it will bolster Arne Slot's defensive choices for the latter half of the season. Currently, Ibrahima Konate and Virgil van Dijk are the only fit first team centre-backs available.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Liverpool broke a transfer record in the January window for a former Manchester United target(Image: Liverpool FC, Liverpool FC via Getty Images)",
      "For Liverpool supporters, there are few sweeter moments than getting the better of Manchester United. Throughout the last decade, the pendulum in English football's fiercest rivalry has swung decisively in Liverpool's favour, with Virgil van Dijk's towering influence playing a major role.",
      "The Dutch centre-back joined from Southampton in January 2018 for a club-record £75million - then a world-record sum for a defender - and proceeded to revolutionise the team's defence. Yet astonishingly, he had come close to moving to Old Trafford just months before.",
      "His former Southampton colleague Charlie Austin revealed that Van Dijk was in serious discussions with United during the summer of 2017. However, the Red Devils opted for Victor Lindelof instead, a choice that allowed Liverpool to swoop in.",
      "FOLLOW OUR LIVERPOOL FB PAGE! Latest Reds news and more on our dedicated Facebook page",
      "Recalling a conversation with Van Dijk during his days at Southampton, Austin told talkSPORT in 2022: \"I remember at the back end of his Southampton career, we were sitting on the bench together at Chelsea away. I said to him, 'Come on Virgil, what's going on, surely Manchester United must have been in for you? They're a massive club in England.'",
      "\"He said, 'Do you know what Chaz, in the summer it was between me and Lindelof - and they went for Lindelof.' Nobody knows that. He told me on the bench and I couldn't believe it. I was gobsmacked.\"",
      "It is a decision that has tormented United in ways the club could barely have envisioned. Not only has Van Dijk flourished spectacularly on Merseyside but he is considered one of the greatest defenders of his era.",
      "Lindelof, in contrast, never quite fulfilled his potential during his eight-year stint at Old Trafford. The Sweden international was consistent but didn't deliver the same commanding presence and defensive solidity as Van Dijk has for Liverpool.",
      "Manchester United opted to sign Victor Lindelof in 2017(Image: Ash Donelon, Manchester United via Getty Images)",
      "Following their regret of not splashing out on Van Dijk, United proceeded to smash the transfer record for a defender by signing Harry Maguire from Leicester City in 2019. Yet Maguire also failed to match the Liverpool skipper for consistency.",
      "His performances swung dramatically, oscillating from reliable to catastrophic and being branded an expensive transfer mistake. Still at the club, the England international has since rediscovered his footing and partly restored a previously damaged reputation, though he is not held in the same esteem as his Liverpool counterpart.",
      "Van Dijk captained Liverpool to the Premier League title last season(Image: PAUL ELLIS, AFP via Getty Images)",
      "Van Dijk, meanwhile, has solidly cemented himself as one of Liverpool's finest ever players. He was instrumental in the club's 2018/19 Champions League and 2019/20 Premier League victories and became just the third defender in history to be crowned PFA Player of the Year in 2019.",
      "He also came second in the Ballon d'Or in 2019 and has clocked up well over 300 appearances for the club. He was named club captain in 2023 after Jordan Henderson's departure, guiding the club to a second Premier League title last term.",

      "Sesko had started six consecutive fixtures and netted three goals in his two appearances for Darren Fletcher before being an unused substitute throughout the win against Manchester City. The forward also featured for just ten minutes in United's victory over Arsenal after coming on for the injured Patrick Dorgu.",

      "Jeremy Jacquet is closing in on a move to Liverpool(Image: (Ramsey Cardy - Sportsfile/UEFA via Getty Images))",
      "Manchester United made a last-ditch attempt to hijack Jeremy Jacquet's transfer to Liverpool. News emerged late on Sunday night that the Reds had agreed a deal with Rennes to sign the centre-back this summer.",
      "The reigning Premier League champions have negotiated a pre-agreement worth an initial £55million plus £5m in add-ons for the 20-year-old, having held talks with the French side over the weekend. But according to journalist Florian Plettenberg, United tried to hijack the transfer on Sunday evening but were unsuccessful, as the defender already had an agreement in place with Liverpool.",
      "Chelsea had approached Stade Rennais earlier in January about a deal for Jacquet, but the French club were reluctant to sanction a departure midway through the campaign. That meant that Jacquet had a choice between Chelsea and Liverpool for whom he wanted to join in the summer, and he opted for the latter because he believes there is a better chance of regular first-team football at Anfield.",
      "Jacquet's move to Liverpool comes amid uncertainty around the future of Ibrahima Konate. The Frenchman is out of contract in the summer and is being linked with a move to Real Madrid.",
      "United, meanwhile, are set for a quiet end to the January transfer window, with their deadline day activity set to focus on securing exits for some of their academy graduates. Providing an update on Friday, Michael Carrick said: \"To be honest, I think we're just working through it. Never say never, of course, because a lot can happen and situations can be thrown up.",
      "“Sometimes it's in our control, sometimes it's maybe something that's out of our control that we've got to deal with. I'm pretty calm. I think we've shown what we're capable of doing as a team and we'll just have to see what the next few days bring, but I'm definitely calm about it.\"",
      "On the pitch, Benjamin Sesko’s stoppage-time winner saw United’s revival under Carrick continue in dramatic fashion as they moved back into the Premier League’s top four with a 3-2 win over Fulham on Sunday. Goals from Casemiro and Matheus Cunha had put United 2-0 up before Raul Jimenez and Kevin restored parity.",
      "But just moments later, United were celebrating again as substitute Sesko rifled the ball beyond Bernd Leno. Speaking after the game, Carrick said: \"There's a lot that went on today in the game. I was well aware of what a good team Fulham are going into the game.",
      "\"I was getting questions thrown at me about teams sitting back here, but I knew it was never going to be like that today.",

      "\"For Ben [Sesko] to come on and have a moment like that is huge. It was nice for him to get his moment in front of the Stretford End. There's not a better place to score a winner like that.",

      "Michael Carrick is braced for a climactic January transfer deadline day at Manchester United(Image: Ash Donelon, Manchester United via Getty Images)",
      "The January transfer window draws to a close on Monday evening and Manchester United continue to be associated with several 11th-hour deals. Interim manager Michael Carrick isn't anticipated to be particularly active during the final stages of the winter market, though there are a handful of rumoured moves with possibilities.",
      "All of this month's activity at Old Trafford thus far has involved departures. Nevertheless, with the side beginning to flourish under Carrick's stewardship, this could be the moment to strengthen the squad in a bid to capitalise on that positive momentum.",
      "One significant development that occurred earlier this month was the announcement that Casemiro will depart the club when this season concludes. While that separation won't happen until the summer, it might be sensible to begin preparations now.",
      "As previously mentioned, this month has predominantly focused on exits from a United standpoint. Five in total, with a collection of emerging talents departing, either permanently or via loan arrangements.",
      "Most recently, defender Rhys Bennett has been sold to Fleetwood Town, whilst striker Joe Hugill has also departed permanently after signing for Kilmarnock. Earlier in January, Sam Mather concluded his lengthy spell with the club and was permitted to terminate his contract in order to join Turkish outfit Kayserispor on a free transfer.",
      "Regarding temporary departures, Toby Collyer has been sent out on loan again and joined Hull City after his brief stint at West Brom was cut short. This follows left-back Harry Amass's earlier departure this month to Norwich City on loan, with a few more similar deals potentially in the pipeline today.",
      "Given the advanced stage of the January window, most prospective deals will carry an element of improbability. Nevertheless, United remain among that select group of clubs that cannot be discounted from pulling off something remarkable before the deadline.",
      "A pursuit of Barcelona midfielder Marc Casado would represent precisely that. The 22-year-old defensive midfielder has been linked with a switch to Old Trafford this month and is allegedly also on the radar of Spanish rivals Atletico Madrid.",
      "Marc Casado has been repeatedly linked with a move to Manchester this month(Image: Quality Sport Images, Getty Images)",
      "Casado has previously been praised as one of the more outstanding prospects to emerge from La Masia in recent seasons. But while he's been a regular feature in Hansi Flick's midfield setup this campaign, he potentially lacks the guaranteed starting role he desires at the Camp Nou.",
      "With Casemiro poised to leave, it won't be long before United lose the most dependable figure they have at the heart of midfield. Casado would represent the opposite end of the scale given he's still in the formative phase of his career, though acquiring him would enable United to allocate a significant portion of salary funds to other areas of the squad.",
      "Casado remains under contract in Catalonia until summer 2028 and it's been suggested his agreement contains a buyout clause valued at approximately £87million. A deadline day transfer would remain expensive considering Barca won't be enthusiastic about offloading anyone without the opportunity to secure a replacement, though Marcus Rashford could provide assistance if that's a transaction Barca would wish to finalise.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "Another prospective target to address that void in midfield is ex-Wolves playmaker Ruben Neves. The Portuguese star has been linked with a Premier League comeback this month following several seasons in Saudi Arabia, and United require someone fitting his specification.",
      "Newcastle have been cited as the alternative destination for the midfielder after suggestions Neves appeared poised to depart Al-Hilal. Yet it has subsequently transpired he now seems destined to pen a fresh contract in Riyadh.",
      "United target Ruben Neves looks set to sign a new deal at Al-Hilal(Image: Getty Images)",
      "According to reports, Neves is in the final phases of agreeing a handsome, new three-year deal with the defending Saudi Pro League champions. This would extinguish any hope United might have harboured in their pursuit of the midfielder.",
      "In numerous respects, Neves could have represented Carrick's perfect midfield reinforcement, whether this month or during the summer. He remains within the appropriate age bracket as he approaches his 29th birthday, possesses considerable expertise in English football and corresponds closely with what United seek in a deep-lying midfielder.",
      "The opportunity isn't completely closed just yet, and United might still be capable of proposing terms that would entice both him and Al-Hilal towards an agreement. Presently, however, it appears one of the club's finest chances in the January window has largely evaporated.",

      "Roy Keane has never shied away from voicing his opinions on Michael Carrick - or his wife for that matter. The 44-year-old was named Manchester United interim head coach earlier this month after Ruben Amorim's dismissal.",
      "It's been a remarkable beginning for the former England midfielder, who secured impressive wins against Manchester City and Arsenal in his opening two matches at the helm. Whilst some have suggested that Carrick's swift and positive influence on the team could put him in contention for the permanent role should the strong results persist, Keane hasn't joined that particular camp.",
      "The former United skipper controversially declared following the 3-2 triumph over Arsenal that he wouldn't hand Carrick the permanent position even if he won the remaining 15 fixtures of the campaign.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UTD FB PAGE! Latest United news and more on our dedicated Facebook page",
      "\"Even if they do get into fourth, I still wouldn't be convinced he's the man for the job. Absolutely not. They need a bigger and better manager. But he has got the opportunity and what a chance for him, and you know what, he's taking it.\"",
      "Despite his earlier comments casting doubt on Carrick's credentials for the permanent role, he appears to have backtracked on those previous statements and now insists he wants him to land the position.",
      "Speaking on The Overlap's Stick to Football podcast earlier this week, Keane admitted: \"I hope they give it [the permanent job] to him. I hope they give it to him in the summer.\"",
      "However, he clarified that whilst he hopes Carrick gets the promotion, he believes it would be the wrong call from the United hierarchy. Speaking to Gary Neville, Keane added: \"I don't think it's the right decision, good luck with it.",
      "\"Yeah, but, I'm sticking to my guns. I've said my piece, I think that he's got the job, and if he gets it in the summer then you go 'listen, good luck to him', but as a caretaker manager, it's a different animal to being manager of United trying to win league titles over the next two, three, four, five years, whatever it might be.",
      "\"I think you can get a better manager than Carrick, absolutely. But I think he's doing a good job, perfect timing for him, and even if he doesn't get the United job, these results a bit like Ruud [Van Nistelrooy], he can get another job, probably another Premiership manager.\"",
      "Michael Carrick has enjoyed a superb start to life at Old Trafford(Image: Getty)",
      "It wasn't only Carrick who came under fire from Keane's remarks, but his wife Lisa as well, who became the target of a barb from the Republic of Ireland legend. The 54-year-old accused Lisa of having a \"big mouth\", saying: \"His wife can always come in [if Carrick doesn't do well], cause she's got a bit of a big mouth sometimes. She's probably doing the team talk.\"",
      "The remarks reignited a long-standing row between the two dating back to 2014, when Keane had directed his criticism towards Carrick. Following United's 2-0 loss to Olympiacos, Carrick gave an interview which Keane subsequently tore apart on television.",
      "The pundit said: \"That interview was just like the performance, flat. He should say a bit more, have a bit more urgency, even in the interview.\" Lisa didn't respond well to Keane's comments, taking to Twitter, now X, to write: \"Roy Keane what a ****, says anything to provoke a reaction.\"",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "She subsequently expressed remorse for her message by removing it and added: \"Deleted my tweet... Emotions got the better of me.\" Carrick himself has also been vocal about Keane's judgements, maintaining that he 'isn't bothered' by what Keane and other ex-United players turned pundits have to say.",
      "\"They're not putting more pressure on me,\" Carrick said ahead of the Manchester derby. \"I don't feel that. There are plenty of opinions around, some positive, some not too much. It's totally irrelevant in terms of what I focus on.",
      "\"There's a lot that can be said, it's the way of the world. I'm not going to pay too much attention to that. For me, the players and staff, we focus on how we're going to succeed.\" When questioned directly about Keane, Carrick added: \"It didn't bother me.\"",

      "Carlos Baleba has long been linked with a transfer to Manchester United(Image: Getty)",
      "Carlos Baleba has previously revealed his stance on a potential switch to Manchester United. The Brighton midfielder has been on the club's radar since last summer.",
      "In a bid to back Ruben Amorim, United splashed out more than £200million during the previous transfer window, bringing in three high-profile signings: Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko. Senne Lammens also joined as the new number one goalkeeper.",
      "Despite these reinforcements, Amorim couldn't hold onto his position and was dismissed after approximately 14 months at the helm, with Michael Carrick taking over. On the topic of exits, it has been confirmed that Casemiro will leave the club when this season concludes.",
      "The Brazilian's departure will leave a significant void in the centre of the park, making a replacement an obvious priority. United were strongly linked with Brighton's Baleba during the summer and whether through a surprise late deadline day swoop or a summer acquisition, the 22-year-old has already made his feelings about joining United abundantly clear.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UTD FB PAGE! Latest United news and more on our dedicated Facebook page",
      "During last summer's window, United reportedly initiated preliminary discussions with Brighton regarding Baleba, but the Seagulls were said to have demanded a staggering £115million fee. This put United off making a serious move for Baleba, though numerous reports indicate he remains firmly on their list of targets.",
      "Some sources even suggest that this month, the club explored the possibility of a January switch, although any deal is more likely to materialise in the summer.",
      "The 22-year-old has been on United's radar since the summer(Image: Getty)",
      "\"I don't really think like that: playing for two or three years and then leaving. Me? I just work. In my head it's all about working and helping my club,\" Baleba explained.",
      "\"If I can help a team-mate, I will. If they can help me, I'll accept that help to push forward and develop. So, I just work to help my team and myself progress in the future.",
      "\"In return, everyone who helps me wants me to go to the highest level. And if there are big clubs who want me, it's not something that worries me or gets me excited.",
      "\"I just need to work hard and keep a cool head. I don't know if I'm going to be the star or the next big thing. For me, being the star is quite a lot.",
      "Baleba is international team-mates with Mbeumo(Image: Getty)",
      "\"Everyone talking about you, singing your name? That just doesn't do it for me. It's not something that gets me running. I just prefer getting my head down and working on the pitch.\"",
      "Whilst this mindset doesn't necessarily aid United's pursuit of the determined Baleba, such characteristics are commendable and would only intensify their ambition to secure the Cameroonian's signature either now or in the coming months.",

      "Sesko, 22, has struggled during his challenging introduction to life at Old Trafford since his £74million transfer from RB Leipzig last summer, but he rose to the occasion with a match-deciding moment, netting in the 94th minute to seal United a thrilling 3-2 triumph on Sunday afternoon.",
      "The Slovenia international, who had managed just five goals in 20 appearances prior to Fulham's visit, came on as a 74th minute replacement for Matheus Cunha and had to bide his time until injury-time for his moment of glory. Indeed, mere moments after Fulham had equalised at 2-2 through Kevin, Bruno Fernandes teed up Sesko to blast the ball into the top corner and claim all three points.",

      "\"Huge moment. I'm so, so pleased,\" Carrick said post-match. \"I think everyone in the changing room, players, staff, absolutely delighted for him and the reception he got when he came back in the changing room, kind of told us everything.",
      "\"He's been confident, to be honest. I think he's been fantastic. We've worked with him a lot in different ways over the last couple of weeks. He's been bright in training, he's looked dangerous, he's done extra. The coaches have done a lot of bits on the side, and Trav particularly has done a lot of work one-on-one with him.",
      "Travis Binnion earned praise from Michael Carrick after the win over Fulham(Image: Ash Donelon/Manchester United via Getty Images)",
      "\"Ben's a big talent and he's got so many positive things and today's a huge goal because that feeling as a striker you have to score a winner in front of the Stretford End like that, it's kind of what you dream of really and after missing a chance, which is what it is for strikers to miss chances to go again, and put that away, absolutely so, so pleased from him. He really deserves it.\"",
      "Binnion made the step up from the under-21s to the first team when Darren Fletcher was made caretaker when Amorim was sacked in early January. He has retained the promotion in Carrick's staff and has clearly been working with Sesko in recent weeks.",
      "He first joined United in 2019 from Sheffield United's academy to take charge of the under-16s, before eventually taking charge of the under-18s and then the under-21s in the summer of 2023.",

      "Marco Silva was furious with the officials after defeat at Old Trafford(Image: AFP/Getty Images)",
      "Fulham manager Marco Silva was furious with the officials after his side slipped to a dramatic late defeat against Manchester United. Benjamin Sesko scored an injury-time winner for United after Fulham had fought back from 2-0 down in a gripping finale at Old Trafford.",
      "Goals from Casemiro and Matheus Cunha had United 2-0 up and cruising on Sunday afternoon before Silva's side roared back. Raul Jimenez netted from the penalty spot after Harry Maguire's foul before Kevin curled a stunning finish into the top corner to equalise in the 91st minute.",
      "However, United went straight up the other end, with Bruno Fernandes picking out Sesko to score on the swivel in the box. His goal ensured United continued their 100 per cent record under Michael Carrick's management, but left Silva raging.",
      "United's opening goal came from a free-kick that was awarded following consultation from VAR. Initially referee John Brooks had awarded United a penalty for Jorge Cuenca's challenge on Cunha in the box.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UTD FB PAGE! Latest United news and more on our dedicated Facebook page",
      "But VAR replays showed Cuenca had got the ball. Yet rather than overturn the penalty, Brooks changed his call to a free-kick outside the box because Cuenca had pulled Cunha's shirt. Fernandes curled a cross in and Casemiro planted a powerful header past Bernd Leno to open the scoring, with Silva subsequently receiving a yellow card for his protestations.",
      "He added: \"The penalty was given by the tackle. After, because the decision was so bad, they found a different foul.",
      "John Brooks changed his decision from a penalty to a free-kick after a VAR review - much to Marco Silva's annoyance(Image: Matt McNulty/Getty Images)",
      "\"I feel my players, I feel our fans but we have to respect and the people in charge. I know why the penalty was given. VAR went in a completely different direction to find something to find a free-kick that was not the reason why the penalty was given.\"",
      "Asked if he had spoken to Brooks, Silva replied: \"I don't want get more cards because I want to be on the touchline. I don't want to speak more.\"",
      "There was further involvement from VAR in the game, with the officials at Stockley Park intervening to rule out Cuenca's goal in the second half which would have made it 2-1. The Fulham defender scored after two deflected shots, only for Samuel Chukwueze to have been found to be marginally offside.",
      "One decision did go in Fulham's favour, however, with Jimenez awarded a penalty after Maguire took him out while trying to block his shot. His cool effort from the spot got the away side back into the match, but ultimately counted for little.",

      "Amad Diallo and Joachim Andersen had efforts saved at either end before United took the lead through Casemiro's powerful header from Bruno Fernandes' free-kick after VAR overturned a penalty decision.",
      "It was 2-0 when Casemiro produced a cheeky no-look pass to find Matheus Cunha and the Brazilian smashed a powerful finish into the roof of the net from an acute angle. Jorge Cuenca saw a goal ruled out by VAR for a narrow offside before Sesko sent a header onto the post with his first touch after coming on as a substitute.",
      "Jimenez brought Fulham back into the game from the penalty spot after being wiped out by Harry Maguire and Kevin came off the bench to curl in a stunning equaliser. But Sesko latched onto Fernandes' cross to make it 3-2 in the 94th minute.",
      "Here are the talking points from a cracker at Old Trafford.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UTD FB PAGE! Latest United news and more on our dedicated Facebook page",
      "United had two shouts for a penalty in the early stages of the match and both times Cuenca had actually got a toe on the ball. The Fulham defender slid in to challenge Bryan Mbeumo first, with the United forward's appeal turned down by referee John Brooks.",
      "But minutes later Brooks pointed to the spot when Cuenca challenged Matheus Cunha next to the byline. Replays showed that the Spaniard had clearly touched the ball, so Brooks was forced to change his decision. Interestingly, VAR changed the penalty decision to a free-kick outside the box, due to the fact Cuenca had pulled Cunha's shirt, much to the annoyance of Marco Silva, who was booked in the aftermath.",
      "It proved a crucial decision as Fernandes delivered the ball into the box and Casemiro climbed high above Cuenca to plant a powerful header past Bernd Leno to make it 1-0.",
      "John Brooks changed his decision from a penalty to a free-kick after a VAR review(Image: Matt McNulty/Getty Images)",
      "Michael Carrick had the luxury of naming the same starting XI in his first two matches in charge against Manchester City and Arsenal, but he had to make a first change to face Fulham, with Patrick Dorgu out with a hamstring injury.",
      "Dorgu had been a revelation on the left wing against City and Arsenal and there wasn't a like-for-like replacement available. His answer was to bring Cunha into the line-up and ask for his forward line to rotate, with no-one naturally inclined to play on that flank.",
      "The result was that United caused overloads in the middle of the pitch, leaving Fulham right-back Timothy Castagne often with no one to mark. Cunha's goal was a good example, the Brazilian finding space in the right channel - on the opposite side to where he was stationed - before smashing into the top corner.",
      "Matheus Cunha scored after being brought into the starting XI (Image: Carl Recine/Getty Images)",
      "We were assured that semi-automated offside decisions would speed up the game and mean fewer lengthy delays. That hasn't felt like the case and there was once again an arduous wait at Old Trafford in the second half as Fulham waited nervously to see whether they had a route back into the match.",
      "It came in scrappy fashion with the Fulham defender putting the ball in the net after Raul Jimenez's free-kick and Samuel Chukwueze's effort had both been blocked. After over four minutes, the VAR decided that Chukwueze had been fractionally offside when Jimenez's free-kick was struck.",
      "Jorge Cuenca saw a goal ruled out by VAR(Image: AFP/Getty Images)",
      "Fulham were let into the game by Maguire's sliding challenge as he desperately tried to block Jimenez's shot on goal. In the event, the Fulham striker had already hit it straight at Senne Lammens and he was undoubtedly then fouled by the centre-back.",
      "Jimenez kept his cool, producing a stuttering run-up and a precise finish into the top corner to make it 2-1 in the 85th minute. His effort was admired by Lammens, who shared a word with the Mexican.",
      "Kevin then picked out the top corner to make it 2-2, but United didn't let their heads drop and Sesko kept his cool to win it.",
      "Raul Jimenez kept his composure from the penalty spot(Image:  Carl Recine/Getty Images)",
      "Carrick was brought in as an interim boss until the end of the season. United's hierarchy have been at pains to make it clear that they will be going for a big name manager in the summer. But the more games that Carrick wins, the more the positivity grows, the more they will be under pressure to seriously consider their ex-midfielder.",
      "Because these performances are night and day compared to the final stages of Ruben Amorim's reign. Gone is the dreaded 3-4-2-1 formation. All the players are in their best positions. They look fluid in attack and much more solid in defence - despite the late wobble here. And they just keep on winning.",

      "The 25-year-old made an impressive start to this season but has featured for merely eight minutes of Ligue 1 action throughout December and January. Predictably, transfer speculation around Gomes emerged with a late winter window move now on the way.",
      "According to reports, Wolves have now reached an agreement in principle for the midfielder on loan until the season's end. He has reported that a €1million (£866,000) fee will be paid for the remaining months with a purchase option worth approximately €7m (£6m).",
      "Whether that clause gets triggered may hinge on various factors including Wolves' anticipated relegation. Molineux staging Championship football next term appears likely as they sit 17 points from safety.",
      "Joao Gomes' future is also probably influencing this transaction with the Brazilian midfielder tipped to depart in the summer. He allegedly surfaced as a target for United with connections to Atletico Madrid and Napoli also materialising.",
      "The academy graduate Gomes was heavily tipped to make a remarkable return during summer 2024, with the player himself having previously discussed such a possibility.",
      "Speaking to L'Equipe back in November 2022, he acknowledged: \"Do I imagine myself coming back one day? Obviously, it's home.",
      "\"I would love to come back. But you never know in football. I just have to keep my feet on the ground, and keep playing, making the most of it. I can't predict what will happen in the future.\"",

      "Angel Gomes has hinted at a possible return to Manchester United(Image: Dave Winter/Shutterstock)",
      "Casemiro's departure has been confirmed at the conclusion of his contract, which would create a vacancy in the club's strongest starting XI. Manuel Ugarte represents another alternative but has struggled to secure regular football during his spell at the club.",
      "Elliot Anderson, Adam Wharton and Carlos Baleba have all been touted for substantial transfers to United in recent months.",
      "An approach to Brighton was lodged for the latter during the closing stages of the summer window, though the Seagulls' nine-figure valuation prompted United to withdraw. Speculation emerged about a fresh bid whilst Baleba was competing at AFCON, but Brighton chief executive Paul Barber swiftly refuted that.",
      "\"No call from Old Trafford,\" he told talkSPORT in early January. \"No call from anyone connected to Manchester United. We have no plans or desire to sell Carlos in this window, or in any future window, but we know he's a talented player and he's got a lot of options ahead of him in the future\".",

      "Carrick has taken charge of his former side for a second time following Ruben Amorim's sacking and has already secured wins against Manchester City and Arsenal. His previous role saw him spend nearly three years as Middlesbrough manager.",
      "Throughout that period, the 44-year-old worked closely with Hackney. The midfielder has attracted top-flight interest for a while now, and Carrick's arrival has only intensified speculation connecting him with United.",

      "\"It's not easy when you're a younger player, but he's certainly done that. There is a level of talent out there in and around football and sometimes it might not be that different player to player, but levels can be jumped, or not, if your head is not in the right place and you don't go about your business in the right way and treat your profession with respect.",
      "\"Hayden certainly does that. He's been exemplary really since I've been here and I really enjoy working with him. He's desperate for more, desperate to learn, and he's a real credit to his family, to himself and to the club.\"",

      "There are reports that United attempted to hijack Liverpool's move for Rennes centre-back Jeremy Jacquet on Sunday. According to French media, United wanted to beat their rivals to the summer signing of the 20-year-old.",
      "But Liverpool have negotiated a pre-agreement worth an initial £55million plus £5m in add-ons for the 20-year-old having held talks with the French side over the weekend.",
      "Meanwhile, Cole Palmer continues to be linked with an unlikely move to Old Trafford with the Chelsea forward reportedly homesick.",
      "On the outgoing front, United have allowed two players to leave the club on loan. Toby Collyer, who spent the first half of the season at West Brom, has joined Hull City, while Harry Amass has made the move to Norwich City after enjoying a fruitful loan spell at Sheffield Wednesday.",

      "Middlesbrough star Hayden Hackney, who has been linked with United in recent weeks, has confirmed he does not want to leave his club on deadline day.",
      "No [I don't want to leave]. I’m really happy. The manager [Kim Hellberg] has got me playing the way I enjoy playing, getting the best out of me. So yeah, I’m really enjoying it. This is what I’ve wanted to do ever since I was a kid, play for Middlesbrough. And where we are in the league at the minute, as long as we just keep going, we feel confident. Winning promotion with Middlesbrough would mean everything to me. I don’t know how I’d be, but I know I’d be over the moon. That is the dream.",
      "MEN Sport understands youngster James Scanlon is set to join League Two's Swindon Town as they push for promotion to League One. United gave the green light this morning. Swindon's playing philisophy and chance to be part of a League Two promotion push considered a good fit.",
      "It's so difficult to get out of the Championship. [Boro] have an unbelievable chance and he's a huge part of that. He's a special player - he's got the X-factor. If he wants to go at the end of the season, then maybe. But they cannot, cannot sell him, at any price, before the end of the season.",
      "BBC Sport's Simon Stone understands United's U21 captain and midfielder Jacob Devaney could be heading to St Mirren on loan this deadline day. The Scottish club sit tenth in the Premiership, they are 13 points off sixth place Falkirk. The top six in the Premiership qualify for the Championship round at the end of the season.",
      "Last year, former United academy coach Colin Little told the Talk of the Devils podcast, the Reds were close to signing Palmer when he was a teenager:",
      "I know Cole Palmer's family quite well, I know his dad and his uncle. We (Man United) were close to getting Cole Palmer when he was about 16, believe it or not. He was umming and ahhing, and I knew he was a big United fan. He was at that age where you're allowed to leave, 16 is it? They were umming and ahhing, Man City, about it. I think City, in the end, made him a good enough offer, but really he was always a United fan, and it was close, I remember speaking. I think City needed to show him a bit more love and that kind of stuff. We never quite got it over the line, but it would've been nice if we did, wouldn't it?",
      "I think it all depends on what happens with Bruno Fernandes, he's obviously not getting any younger, if the Saudis come back in for a whopping £100 million plus, I think they may potentially think, 'okay, thank you and bring in Cole [Palmer]'. But I don't see why they'd bring in Cole and then have Bruno as well, both kind of the same position. Unless they're looking to drop Bruno a bit further deeper. But yeah, if you've got a player of that calibre saying, I'm unhappy and I want to come to your club or come back home, I think anyone is going to be, you know, the alarm bells are going to start ringing and maybe having questions about it because he's a fantastic player. Yeah, I would be surprised [if Palmer left] because I think Chelsea have kind of built a project, a lot of young players, for the past two seasons, been evolved around Cole Palmer. You would say that, obviously not in the league position at the minute, but maybe they're in a better place at present. So yeah, it would be a shock to see him leave to Man United.",
      "If United were to make a move for Palmer, it is highly unlikely he would join today.",

      "Earlier this month, an update claimed that the Catalan club is unwilling to pay the amount previously agreed for a permanent transfer and had offered two suggestions to United. One was signing Rashford for a lower fee, and the other was to re-sign him on loan for another season, with an obligation to buy in 2027.",

      "Chelsea signed Palmer for around £40million from Manchester City and would need an outrageous fee to part ways with the forward.",
      "Manchester United have been linked with a move for the 23-year-old, but it is being claimed they would take an astronomical transfer fee for Chelsea to even consider letting him leave.",
      "The same report from Football Insider is claiming that Palmer currently has no plans to leave Chelsea and is said to be happy to sign a new contract at Stamford Bridge.",
      "Rotherham are reportedly planning to make a loan offer for Manchester United forward Gabriele Biancheri. That's according to Football League World, who are reporting that the Millers want a versatile forward and believe Biancheri fits the bill, having notched five goals and three assists in 10 Premier League 2 games this season.",
      "Biancheri, who is eligible to represent Wales, Italy and Canada, signed for the Reds in 2023 from Cardiff and scored 12 goals in the under-18s Premier League in 2023/24 before scoring 22 times across under-18s and under-21s competitions last term.",

      "Manchester United are claimed to have been long-term admirers of Jacquet, while the defender was also heavily linked with a move to Chelsea last month.",

      "Michael Carrick celebrates Manchester United's dramatic late win against Fulham",
      "With seven minutes to go at Old Trafford, it looked like being a walk in the park for Manchester United. They hadn't had it all their own way against an impressive Fulham side, but they had defended well, attacked with some verve and looked set for a run-of-the-mill 2-0 win.",
      "A little under 20 minutes later, the roar that greeted the final whistle was one of ecstasy mixed with relief. United did their best to throw away a routine win, but having rescued themselves with Benjamin Sesko's 94th-minute winner, it arguably made for a more enjoyable afternoon.",
      "Certainly, the United fans leaving the ground will remember the day more than they would have done had the contest finished 2-0, or even 2-1, after Raul Jimenez scored an 85th-minute penalty that set the mayhem in motion.",

      "That was a point made by Michael Carrick after the match, when his smile lit up his post-match press conference. The 44-year-old has been calm and unflustered in his media dealings, as he has been on the sidelines so far, but for the first time there was a sense of emotion on show.",
      "\"It's the best feeling, I have to say. Some of the best moments here that I've been lucky enough to be a part of are when you get a moment of elation and excitement like that,\" he said of Sesko's dramatic winner, which came after Fulham had equalised in the first minute of injury time.",
      "\"There's no better place, in front of the Stretford End, and it ends up meaning a bit more. I think people leave here with more than just, you know, United win today, and it kind of puts layers on top of that and the connection and the feeling, the emotion, it’s why we all love it so much and especially the supporters, so it goes a long way.",
      "\"The excitement that's part of this club, it's not always the easiest way, but certainly when they come along, it's pretty special.\"",
      "Carrick was part of plenty of wins that fit this narrative during his 464 games for the club, but it's very different doing it as a player than as a manager.",
      "When Sesko's goal hit the back of the net, the substitutes tore down the touchline to join in with the celebrations, while Senne Lammens raced from his goal into the Fulham half before retreating.",
      "But Carrick remained calm and after a brief chat with assistant Steve Holland, he tried to call back Leny Yoro from the celebrations to come on. He explained the differences between doing it as a player and a manager afterwards, revealing he always felt his team would get a chance to win the game.",
      "\"Yeah, slightly different,\" he said. \"I think when you're in the thick of it as a player, you're right in the moment and you obviously don't always see the bigger picture. You're a little bit different in terms of the attachment to the game. I was pretty calm all the way through.",
      "\"We were disappointed obviously with the second goal, but I was aware there was still eight minutes to go at that point when they scored. If anything, I was thinking there's a long time to go and we still had the players on the pitch at that point that could really make the difference for us. I was still really positive that I thought we'd find a moment.",
      "\"Listen, it's hard to hold your emotions together when the goal goes in like that, so I think we all celebrated when that went in. But, yeah, I did feel we'd have a moment. We tend to, in them type of games, you always have a moment, it's just whether you can take it, and Ben certainly did that from Bruno's great work down the right.\"",
      "It has been noticeable in Carrick's three-game reign so far that he is determined to project calm to his players. He rarely shows emotion on the sidelines, but admits it is about getting the balance right of when to let some emotion out.",
      "\"Certainly, that composure and that calmness for the players to be able to think clearly,\" said Carrick. \"It's getting the balance, and I think we've got the balance pretty well over the last three games of playing with that bit of fire and a bit of hunger, but making good decisions as well.",
      "\"I'm not sure we all made good decisions when that goal went in in terms of how we celebrated, but that's what you strive for, that's why we all love the game for moments like that, so when they do come, you're going to make the most of them.\"",

      "Fulham scored twice in quick succession to level the game in the 91st minute, but there was another twist when Bruno Fernandes found Sesko in the box with seconds to play. Sesko, who had been introduced from the bench, found the top right corner to secure a victory.

      "Before the victory over Arsenal, Casemiro announced he would not be signing a contract extension and would be leaving United at the end of the season. And so began a long goodbye for the Brazilian.",
      "He impressed at the Emirates but against Fulham on Sunday afternoon, he proved how difficult he will be to replace. For a defensive midfielder, Casemiro is not expected to be an elite header of the ball but bar Harry Maguire, he was the only man on the pitch you wanted to be on the end of a Bruno Fernandes free kick.",

      "After the break, some frustration could be heard in the crowd as United failed to break down the Cottagers. But there was Casemiro again, threading an impressive pass for Matheus Cunha to fire home.",
      "When he was eventually replaced by Manuel Ugarte, it was then that United were reminded of the transfer priority they need to resolve. The Reds lost control of the midfield without Casemiro and went from the comfort of a 2-0 lead to needing a moment of spectacular drama to win the game 3-2.",
      "The worry for United is that defensive midfielder's either cost the world or are not at the level required. Erik ten Hag allowed £42m to be spent on Ugarte in 2024 but he does not look to be capable of replacing Casemiro long-term.",
      "With United unable to rely on the Uruguayan, Ineos will need to be prepared to spend big. Monday marks January transfer deadline day and unless there is a remarkable change of heart, it should be a quiet one at Carrington.",
      "But on the eve of the big day, United were reminded of a huge deal they will need to make in the summer.",

The 21-year-old made the switch to Stamford Bridge this summer in a £40million transfer - which includes a 10 per cent sell-on clause.",

      "But the Argentina international struggled badly against the Hammers, having been partly blamed for his team going 2-0 down at half-time. And ex-Reds captain-turned-pundit Neville has explained on the Gary Neville podcast why Garnacho's performance was crucial to his team facing a shock home loss to their relegation-threatened opponents before they came back to win 3-2.",
      "He said: \"In the first half, I have to say that West Ham were absolutely fantastic. They dominated the game, even though they didn’t dominate possession; they dominated the game.",

      "Carrick has confirmed that Patrick Dorgu is set for a spell of recovery after pulling up during United's win over Arsenal. However, the interim head coach was unable to give an exact timeline on when he should return to action.",
      "Speaking during his press conference on Wednesday, the 44-year-old said: \"Pat unfortunately is going to be out for a period of time. Still working through how long that is going to be.",
      "\"Disappointing because he has had such a big couple of weeks, we weren't sure if it was a little bit of cramp or if it was something more serious, at the moment it is looking a little bit more of a serious note. A few weeks out, how many weeks?",
      "Patrick Dorgu sustained an injury against Arsenal(Image: Getty Images)",
      "\"We will have to wait and see. It is disappointing for all of us and Pat, he is in such a good place but unfortunately it is part of football and something you have got to work through and get him back as soon as we can.\"",
      "On missing Dorgu, he added: \"It is not ideal, of course it is not, we don't want to lose good players from the group. That is part of having a squad and assembling a squad to be able to cover certain things.",
      "\"We have got players who can do that. It is the nature of the beast, unfortunately.\"",
      "Potential return date: Late February",
      "Joshua Zirkzee has returned to training ahead of Sunday's game against Fulham, having missed both of Carrick's matches in charge of the first-team. Speaking about Dorgu's recovery, Carrick explained: \"Josh is back training this week, which is good news.",
      "\"He has been out for a short amount of time, first training with us since we have been here so that is great to have Josh back.\"",
      "While it is unknown as to whether he will be available to return to action straight away, or whether Carrick may take a more integrated approach remains to be seen.",
      "Potential return date: Sunday, February 1 vs Fulham (H)",
      "Matthijs De Ligt has been out of action with a back injury since November, and is yet to return to training as a result. The defender suffered a \"setback\" in his recovery ahead of the weekend's match with Arsenal, and his interim head coach provided another update on Wednesday.",
      "Carrick said of the Dutchman: \"De Ligt is not training with us yet. Just working through the process of getting him back as soon as we can.\"",
      "Potential return date: February",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Bruno Fernandes has just brought up six years at Manchester United",
      "When Manchester United were weighing up a move for Bruno Fernandes in 2019, they asked a former player for a reference. Cristiano Ronaldo was an international teammate of Fernandes at the time, and he vouched for the kind of player and character that United would be getting.",
      "The transfer that would see Fernandes follow the same path from Sporting to Manchester as Ronaldo would take another few months to come to fruition, United eventually making their move to sign him in January 2020. But boy, did it prove to be money well spent.",
      "The fee for Fernandes could reach £67million if all add-ons are met. In reality, he has been a £100million footballer for Manchester United since the moment he walked into the building six years ago yesterday. The club had done their due diligence on Fernandes and knew what they were getting. Not just an elite-level player, but somebody who was desperate to win and wouldn't think twice of calling out any slip in standards.",
      "Try MEN Premium NOW for just £1",
      "It probably summed up his character that Fernandes played 90 minutes two days after signing for the club. That game against Wolves was six years ago tomorrow and a goalless draw was an inauspicious start. It didn't take long for his demonstrative side to appear. Now it is referees who tend to cop for it, but back then it was often his teammates, many of who just weren't on the same wavelength.",
      "The first time I remember being struck by Fernandes's force of personality was in his third appearance for the club. He started on the bench in a Europa League last-16 first-leg tie at Club Brugge, but was already showing that he was a leader. When he came on in the final nine minutes, United improved immediately, and on a couple of occasions, he scolded teammates for not getting the ball to him quickly enough.",
      "It was the kind of reaction that could cause concern in some dressing rooms, but speaking to Ole Gunnar Solskjaer afterwards, it was clear the United manager wanted more of it, rather than less.",
      "\"He’s another conductor and leader and winner,\" said Solskjaer. \"He wants to win, He doesn’t take 99 per cent as good enough and he’s impressed me. That’s something you see when you watch him but you don’t really know about until you have him in your group. He’s been absolutely top class.\"",
      "That is a description every United manager since would agree with. No matter how bad things got, there was always Fernandes to fall back on. He has rarely let his standards drop.",
      "His elevation to the captaincy in the summer of 2023 felt a long time coming. He had been the heartbeat of the team for a while and was already regularly wearing the armband, but now became the on-pitch leader. His ascension hasn't been without its faults and there has been discussion about his suitability for the role, never more so than after a stroppy second-half when losing 7-0 to Liverpool at Anfield in March 2023.",
      "The fact that came before he was confirmed as club captain showed that those inside Old Trafford never lost faith in Fernandes. That on-pitch demeanour might occasionally rile critics, but it comes from a position of being desperate to win. That hasn't happened often enough for Fernandes and United.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FACEBOOK PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "Speak to anyone who works regularly at Carrington and Old Trafford, and they will highlight the human side of Fernandes' leadership. Forget what happens on the pitch; he is a unifying force off it. Humble enough to treat every member of staff the same way and make sure that they are all happy.",
      "He wasn't alone in being stung by the redundancies implemented since Sir Jim Ratcliffe's arrival in February 2024, and he has always tried to help where he can. When staff perks were slashed ahead of the FA Cup final that May, he offered to pay for them out of his own pocket, a gesture that was rejected.",
      "That he has won just two trophies in his time at Old Trafford is a disappointing return. If anyone in the last six years deserves more, it is Fernandes. He is the only player in this period who would even be in a conversation about whether he would get in to the best and most successful United sides of the past.",
      "The Carabao Cup and FA Cup are a meagre return, and that won't change this season. Even if United get back into the Champions League, there will be no silverware at the end of this campaign. At that point, Fernandes will have a decision to make.",
      "He came close to leaving for Saudi Arabia in the summer and reopened old wounds recently by giving an interview in Portugal in which he said United wanted him to go but lacked the \"courage\" to tell him. He will again make a decision on his future this summer, probably after the World Cup, and an exit can't be ruled out.",
      "He has at least looked happier since Michael Carrick returned. Simplicity has been the hallmark of Carrick's first couple of weeks in charge and he has restored the Premier League's best No. 10 to a role playing as a No. 10. It has got the best out of Fernandes once more.",
      "He has been engaged by Carrick's decision to make training sessions shorter but more intense. He has a strong relationship with the 44-year-old, who was on Solskjaer's staff when he arrived at the club. Carrick believes Fernandes is in a good place at the moment.",
      "If United can secure a return to the Champions League, then perhaps Fernandes feels it is worth staying on. His time in Manchester deserves a fitting coda for what he has delivered. If he does wish to leave, it can't be held against him. Few players have given more for less in red in recent years.",
      "If he does stay, he will surpass Ronaldo as United's most-used player from Portugal. That is a record that would mean a lot for somebody whose affiliation with the club began when he used to watch Ronaldo playing here. His career in Manchester hasn't hit the heights of the five-time Ballon d'Or winner, but there is little doubt that, in a difficult period, he has been just as important to Manchester United as his countryman.",

      "We have answered your burning Manchester United questions this week",
      "The good times keep on rolling for Manchester United under Michael Carrick. The head coach followed a win against Manchester City in his first game in charge with a stunning success against Arsenal at the Emirates last weekend.",
      "While it's been a quiet month in the transfer market, that hasn't stopped the good vibes from flowing, given the uplift in performances seen under Carrick. United now sit fourth and firmly in the race for Champions League football next season.",
      "This weekend they face Fulham at Old Trafford in what will be a very different tactical test for United under Carrick. For the first time they will dominate possession and have to break down a low block. There are also a few days remaining in the transfer window and your questions on United are covered below.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FACEBOOK PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "We run weekly question and answer sessions, so click here to submit your questions, and we'll answer them next week. Here are the answers to some of this week's questions:",
      "We need wingers",
      "More of a statement than a question but one that is difficult to disagree with. I don't think right-wingers are needed. Amad, Bryan Mbeumo and Patrick Dorgu can all play on the right and I think all of them would prefer to play on the right.",
      "The problem is on the left. Dorgu has done well in that role in the last couple of weeks and you would expect Matheus Cunha to come in now. Mason Mount could also play there, but I don't think any of them convince.",
      "Cunha is better centrally, for me, and while Dorgu is an excellent squad player, I think you want another left-wing option, and probably a right-footed one. It's something United will look at this summer when the transfer window opens, although midfielders are the priority.",
      "Wingers weren't needed under Ruben Amorim and United are about to lose a couple of left-wingers this summer as well. Speaking of which...",
      "Will Rashford come back?",
      "I can't see it, too much water has gone under the bridge for this to happen, although it is probably true that if he was here now under Carrick, he would be playing regularly on the left wing.",
      "Rashford is loving it at Barcelona and he is having a good season at the Nou Camp, with nine goals and 12 assists in 31 appearances in all competitions. He wants to stay at Barcelona and Barcelona want to keep him, so I think a return to United is unlikely. For starters, it would annoy the player, and he would immediately return as the club's highest-paid player now that Casemiro is leaving.",
      "The issue will be financial. There is an option to make the deal permanent for €35million, but that feels unlikely to happen given Barcelona's ongoing woes. Especially when Rashford is on the kind of Premier League wage that the Catalan club is unlikely to be able to afford.",
      "Compromise will be needed on all sides but that feels more likely to happen than Rashford returning to United in a first-team role.",
      "Will Man United re-sign Greenwood?",
      "I can't see this ever happening, to be honest. Greenwood has had another productive season at Marseille but the optics of bringing him back are not good, especially when United have already tried to reintegrate him once.",
      "The attempt to bring him back into the fold in the summer of 2023 was poorly handled and ended disastrously. The club underestimated the backlash from supporters and in the end the right decision was made.",
      "United could still profit from Greenwood, with a sizeable sell-on in the deal with Marseille. He is playing well enough to get a move but the biggest transfer fee would come from the Premier League and I can't see any English club being willing to fight the PR battle to sign him.",
      "Kindly transfer updates",
      "You've asked very nicely, but I'm afraid there is little to offer. United have been adamant all month they won't sign anyone unless a long-term target becomes available. That was always unlikely to happen and with just a couple of days until the window closes, we can now consider it almost certain that no arrivals will be incoming.",
      "United will instead keep their powder dry until the summer, and if they return to the Champions League as well, that will be a major boost to their spending power. With a bigger transfer kitty, I would expect a couple of midfielders, a left-winger, a defender and maybe a new back-up goalkeeper.",
      "In terms of the final days of this window, there will be a few loan moves for academy players. The only first-team player in with a chance of leaving is Tyrell Malacia, who wants to move five months before his contract expires. He is desperate to go and play first-team football.",

      "Manchester United could finally sign Leon Goretzka this summer – as the midfielder is due to leave Bayern Munich when his contract expires at the end of this season.",
      "United first showed interest in 2017, but the Germany international left Schalke for Bayern Munich rather than moving to the Premier League. Links to Goretzka have regularly reemerged during his time in Bavaria.",
      "Seven-and-a-half years later, this eighth season will be his last playing for Bayern. The club announced four days before the transfer deadline that Goretzka will leave at the end of this season rather than during this winter window.",
      "The player acknowledges clubs have been keen in January. However, Goretzka says: \"As much as I am honoured by the interest from international top clubs, I have made a clear decision for myself to remain at FC Bayern until the end of the season.",
      "\"At the same time, the club and I have decided in good and constructive talks that our successful time together will come to an end in the summer. As I have said before, this is also the right moment for me to open a new chapter once again, both as a footballer and as a person.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FB PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "Bayern's sporting director Christoph Freund also confirmed Goretzka's impending exit. He said: \"In the last few weeks, we have intensified the talks and spoken openly about what his further path will be in the summer — in the summer, his time at FC Bayern will come to an end.",
      "\"By then, he will have spent eight years here, extremely successful, extremely strong in the way he has conducted himself as a person and as a player. But before that, he will fight with us so that we still have some good weeks ahead.\"",
      "United could now be one of several clubs interested in Goretzka this summer. Arsenal and Tottenham Hotspur are the two other Premier League clubs credited with an interest in the 30-year-old this winter.",
      "However, there are also links to a whole host of clubs across Europe. Atletico Madrid and Barcelona are said to be keen in Spain, with the latter's head coach, Hansi Flick, previously working with the player at Bayern and with the Germany national team.",

      "Chido Obi retains huge potential.(Image: 2026 Manchester United FC)",
      "Chido Obi took selfies with young Manchester United fans at Old Trafford last week. The striker scored the decisive goal in a 2-1 victory after dropping down to play in the FA Youth Cup against Derby.",
      "The teenager made his first Under-18 appearance in an on-record fixture for 11 months. United fastracked Obi after his arrival from Arsenal, and he made seven first-team appearances in the second half of last season, so it was interesting to see him be handed a start in a competition for U18s.",
      "On the surface, it may seem like Obi has regressed, given he dropped down to play U18 football again, but his inclusion in the team to face Derby was a signal of intent from Darren Fletcher.",
      "The Youth Cup is for players who are under 18 on August 31 of the current campaign. Obi celebrated his 18th birthday in November, making him eligible for the competition for a successive season.",
      "Ultimately, there are two factors at play when United decide which academy fixtures a young player should feature in. The first, and most important, is whether it's best for the player to partake in that game. Will they learn from the experience? Will it aid their development? Those conversations take place among coaches.",
      "The second consideration is the wider context. Will the team have a better chance of winning with said player? How will the team members complement each other? Is the team strong enough to compete?",
      "United academy sources have maintained the development of individuals is more important than results, but football is about winning at the end of the day. And United want their young players to win.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FB PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "Obi pictured after playing in the Youth Cup last week.(Image: 2026 James Gill - Danehouse)",
      "It's a balancing act for staff to decide which academy players should feature in specific competitions across the age groups, and it was decided that Obi should start against Derby. How much he learned from the experience is debatable, but he scored the decisive goal, which vindicated the decision.",
      "The prestige of the Youth Cup was a factor in the decision to start Obi. United have won the competition more than any other club, and it's the pinnacle of academy football, which everyone wants to win.",
      "Obi fired the U18s to the final four of the Youth Cup last season, scoring seven goals in just four matches, but he was marked out of the semi-finals by eventual winners Aston Villa.",
      "Fletcher hopes his side can reach the final - and win it. The prospect of Obi and JJ Gabriel playing together in the competition is exciting, but there was a moment against Derby when they got in each other's way.",
      "It will be interesting if Obi is involved with the U18s when they play Oxford in the next round of the Youth Cup. On paper, Gabriel alone could provide United with enough quality to progress to the quarter-finals.",
      "It certainly won't do Obi any harm to help the U18s lift the Youth Cup this season, but his involvement does spark discussion about his development and what to expect in the next few years.",
      "Obi played 52 minutes for the first-team against Fulham in the proper FA Cup in March last year. That was his first taste of playing in front of a full capacity at Old Trafford, but there were just over 2,000 fans within the ground to watch the youngsters take on Derby in the Youth Cup.",
      "Obi and Gabriel are a force to be reckoned with in the Youth Cup.(Image: Manchester United)",
      "The truth is that Obi still needs time to develop. He was overexposed to senior football last term due to injuries, and staff agreed he needed to learn away from the spotlight in this campaign.",
      "That might have been a hard pill to swallow for Obi, considering he became the youngest player to start a Premier League game for United against Brentford before excelling during the post-season tour.",
      "Obi scored twice against Hong Kong, looking better than Rasmus Hojlund. The same comment had been made when Obi replaced Hojlund in the FA Cup defeat to Fulham a few months before that trip.",
      "The youngster started against Leeds in Stockholm - Hojlund was named on the bench - in the opening pre-season friendly of the summer, but only started one game during the United States tour.",
      "Since then, Obi has exclusively played in academy fixtures, and his only senior squad appearance came against Wolves, when the Premier League's worst side visited Old Trafford at the end of last month.",
      "United fans were desperate to see more of Obi in the first-team after some encouraging, albeit green, performances, however, he has predominantly played for the U21s this term.",
      "Obi has been challenged by senior opposition for the U21s, playing in the National League Cup and EFL Trophy, two competitions which pit academy players against senior teams. United academy coaches love those competitions because there is no place to hide against senior players.",
      "Obi pictured during the USA tour last summer.",
      "The 18-year-old has continued to score, netting seven in 19 games, but his output has slightly dipped after a freakish first campaign at the club, and there is still more to work on.",
      "Obi's decision-making and last ball in the final third need improvement, as does his work rate out of possession. United have felt academy fixtures are the best place for him to develop those aspects of his game.",
      "\"Because he's had exposure with the first-team, I think people expect performance levels that are really consistent and really high. You've got first-team players across the country who don't do that.",
      "\"The expectation on him is high, but he has to deliver the basics, and what he did from minute 30 to 80 when he came off is he pressed, he ran and he occupied two centre halves to give other players space on the pitch to exploit, which is why we dominated the ball.",
      "Chido Obi of Manchester United (Image: 2025 Robbie Jay Barratt - AMA)",
      "\"I'm really pleased with him and we haven't even scraped the top of the iceberg with him. He's got loads to come. That will come from how he sees the game, keeps working hard and recognises he has stuff to develop because that's always a challenge when you have that first-team exposure and then you go away and have to start working on things.\"",
      "Binnion continued: \"When you score as many goals as he has throughout his relatively short life, you can define yourself by goals. And we all know there's probably only two or three strikers in the world who get two goals in every three games.",
      "\"If you're used to scoring two goals in every game, then recognising what the role is, how you have to go around it takes a little bit of time. He is dying to be a footballer.",
      "\"He is hungry. And he's still learning the game, learning how to project himself and learning how to play within a team, the club's shape and system, so there's still lots for him to do. The key is he wants to play, he wants to do well and wants to train. He could train every day if he could.\"",
      "Obi hopes to return to the first-team by the end of the season. He's in safe hands to achieve that aim.",

      "Senne Lammens has doubtless never experienced anything quite like what he did at the Emirates on Sunday. The viral picture that did the rounds earlier this week, showing him surrounded by players from both sides, does a good job of explaining the test for goalkeepers against Arsenal.",
      "It was clear the Gunners fancied their chances of getting at an inexperienced goalkeeper at this level. Time and again, they crowded him out, blocked his path to the ball and looked to stick deliveries right into his six-yard box. It was a tactic that had worked against the last two Manchester United goalkeepers they have faced.",
      "Andre Onana was unconvincing in a Premier League defeat at the Emirates last season, and Altay Bayindir was found flapping at Old Trafford on the opening day of this season.",
      "Try MEN Premium NOW for just £1",
      "In contrast, Lammens looked unflappable. The trust his defenders have quickly developed in him was made clear by Harry Maguire's Instagram post on Monday. The image showed Lammens surrounded by at least 13 players and included the captain 'Come on Senne Lammens punch another one clear for us\".",
      "It was a calm and composed performance from a young goalkeeper developing a reputation for just those traits. Lammens is just 23, which is no age for a first-choice goalkeeper, and is also relatively inexperienced. He made just 68 appearances in Belgium's top division before signing for United for £18.2million this summer.",
      "That was a battle won by the club and the scouting department, particularly goalkeeping talent spotter Tony Coton, who liked the look of Lammens. It was a gamble to sign a goalkeeper from Belgium and throw him straight in at Old Trafford, but he has had a good season and has the longevity that Emiliano Martinez doesn't. The Argentine was the man that Ruben Amorim wanted in goal.",
      "Lammens was so composed on debut that he was serenaded with chants of 'Are you Schemichel in disguise?'. His work with the ball at his feet has been risk-free and he is commanding in his box. There have been none of the jitters that accompanied the sight of Bayindir competing for a high ball.",
      "Senne Lammens has impressed since joining(Image: 2026 Manchester United FC)",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FACEBOOK PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "He also exudes calm to those in front of him, unlike Onana. Lammens is an organised goalkeeper capable of making good decisions. With Onana, you were never quite sure what was going to happen next, and that kind of uncertainty can spread to a defence.",
      "As you would expect from any young goalkeeper, Lammens hasn't been faultless, but his errors haven't been as glaring as those committed by Onana and Bayindir. He didn't have a great game in the 4-4 draw with Bournemouth and could have done better with Everton's goal in their win at Old Trafford. Compared to what came before, these are minor quibbles.",
      "In fact, the best thing you can say about Lammens is that nobody is really talking about him, and for a goalkeeper, that is a good position to be in. If your goalkeeper is attracting a lot of attention, it is rarely good news.",
      "Lammens' name was prominent again on Thursday morning, but for his goalscoring rather than his goalkeeping. Anatoliy Trubin's dramatic header for Benfica against Real Madrid in the Champions League on Wednesday was a stunning moment, and Lammens knows how it feels to score against the Spanish giants, albeit at a slightly different level.",
      "He did just that for Club Brugge against Real Madrid's youngsters in the UEFA Youth League back in 2019. His header secured a point in a 2-2 draw. He has already been up for a corner for United this season, adding to the chaos at Tottenham when Matthijs de Ligt got an injury-time equaliser.",
      "Maybe one day Lammens can follow in the footsteps of Peter Schmeichel by scoring for United. For now, just trying to get close to the standards he set in goal for the club is enough.",

      "Fernandes is viewed as undroppable.(Image: Manchester United via Getty Images)",
      "Kobbie Mainoo covered more ground than any other Manchester United player in the club's last two games. The midfielder left nothing out there, putting himself about like a player with a point to prove.",
      "Mainoo's stock took a hit during Ruben Amorim's tenure, but strong performances against Manchester City and Arsenal were reminders of the wonderfully talented player United have on their hands.",
      "\"I think part of a career is a few ups and downs and sometimes it goes in different trajectories, but I think we've seen last week what Kobbie can bring. It was great,\" said Carrick before Arsenal.",
      "Mainoo is posting United-related photos on his social media again. There had been a nine-month Instagram hiatus, but he's been brought back into the fold by Carrick, who has known him since he was a boy.",
      "The 20-year-old was disenchanted with life under Amorim, and he was set to push to leave on loan in the January window until the Portuguese was axed amid rising tensions with the board.",
      "It was criminal that Amorim could not find a way to fit Mainoo into his system. Amorim overlooked Mainoo in his first game against Ipswich, which set the tone. He experimented with Mainoo as a No.10 and up front. There were jokes within the squad about him playing as a striker.",
      "Amorim eventually settled on his role, deciding he would compete with Bruno Fernandes for a starting spot in midfield. \"He is fighting for the position now with Bruno. I changed two midfielders. I like Mason Mount there because we want to score a goal,\" said Amorim in August.",
      "\"And then when I changed it, I felt that the team needed to return to one holding midfielder. So he just needs to fight for the position with Bruno in training. Like it should be at Manchester United.\"",
      "Mainoo was fighting a losing battle from that moment onwards, but he remained committed to winning his place back, doing extra work during the international breaks and changing his chef at home.",
      "Mainoo took another step forward against Arsenal.(Image: 2026 Manchester United FC)",
      "Mainoo's frustration began to show by the end of Amorim's tenure, though. He liked a few ill-timed posts on social media about Amorim, and his half-brother paraded a 'Free Kobbie Mainoo' t-shirt at Old Trafford. United insisted that Mainoo knew nothing about the stunt from his sibling.",
      "The frustration was understandable, given he'd gone from starting at Euro 2024 to not getting a sniff of a league start, but Mainoo had little chance when his manager pitted him against Fernandes.",
      "Fernandes has been an ever-present in the starting team since his arrival from Sporting Lisbon. He'd only ever missed two United games due to injury until his recent hamstring issue.",
      "Amorim essentially said Mainoo would never start in the Premier League when he confirmed he was competing with Fernandes. The United captain is undroppable and kept Mainoo out of the team.",
      "Mainoo was the biggest winner from Amorim's sacking, but his departure was bound to be a negative for some others, like Mason Mount, whose relationship with Amorim was strong.",
      "Mount benefited from Amorim's formation, and United were a better team when he was in the starting line-up in the first half of the campaign. Mount delivered consistently strong performances, scoring important goals against Sunderland and Crystal Palace to finally have momentum behind him.",
      "\"He can defend, he can attack. It's the quality that when he touches the ball, it's really good. So it's not a surprise for me, but of course, we need to take care of him,\" said Amorim last month.",
      "Writing on social media when Amorim's sacking was announced, Mount said: \"Thank you, gaffer. All the best to you and your staff for the future.\" Unsurprisingly, there was no farewell message from Mainoo.",
      "Mount and Fernandes embrace at Selhurst Park.(Image: 2025 Manchester United FC)",
      "Carrick has switched to 4-2-3-1 and Mainoo has slotted perfectly back into a three-man midfield, but the tactical switch now means Mount is competing with Fernandes to start as the central attacking midfielder.",
      "Mount was introduced in injury time in the Manchester derby and was an unused substitute against Arsenal. It's too early to say he won't be used as much by Carrick, but he only needs to look at Mainoo's situation from earlier in the season to know what happens when Fernandes is the competition to start.",
      "The silver lining for Mount is that he was in a similar position in the summer when Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo were signed, setting them up as the first-choice players in Amorim's No.10 roles.",
      "Speaking in pre-season, Mount reflected: \"Any opportunity you get, you've got to try and take it. And, yeah, I mean, I'll always back myself. I know what I can do. But we're a team and we're all working together in that.",
      "\"Obviously, with the new signings coming in, they (Cunha and Mbeumo) are going to elevate us to another level, and we all need to be at that level to really perform.\"",
      "Mount backed himself and successfully found a way to force himself into the side. That may be more difficult to do against Fernandes, but he's already shown the required talent and mentality to do so. It will also help that Mount could feature on the flanks in the 4-2-3-1. It would be stupid to write him off.",

      "Lammens made an impressive debut against Sunderland.(Image: Getty Images)",
      "Senne Lammens wore a polo shirt and a navy sweatshirt when he visited Old Trafford after signing for Manchester United. The young goalkeeper looked as though he could be joining United to work in their HR department.",
      "The same observation was made when Lammens reported for international duty with Belgium last week - the 23-year-old was dressed in a beige collared jacket, a khaki t-shirt and chinos.",
      "\"By accident, I saw an article saying he was wearing something boring when he reported for international duty and fans saying they hoped he stays like this,\" laughed Hayk Milkon, one of Lammens' former coaches.",
      "\"This 'boringness' is just the way Senne is, he's really calm and no excesses. He focuses on what he needs to focus on and is open with the people around him. He keeps his feet on the ground.\"",
      "If Lammens looks like someone who could work in an office, every workplace would love to have him in their five-a-side team. United believe they have signed a young goalkeeper with huge potential, and fans who were present at Old Trafford against Sunderland left the stadium buzzing about his debut.",
      "The quirk is that Lammens appears to be a different person when he wears his goalkeeper kit. He made a supremely confident United debut, aggressively commanded his area and kept a clean sheet.",
      "Milkon coached Lammens during their time together at Club Brugge. Milkon is now the youngest manager in the Belgian top-flight and Lammens plays for the biggest club in England.",
      "\"It was Senne with his headphones on. He would go into the gym to do his recovery or some extra top-ups. Or he would just go to relax by playing basketball - he loved to play basketball.\"",
      "Lammens celebrates against Sunderland. (Image: 2025 Ben Roberts - Danehouse)",
      "Milkon coached in different roles at Club Brugge. He was the assistant of Club NXT (their reserve team), served as their interim manager, was in charge of the Under-18s and eventually became a first-team coach.",
      "His time at Club Brugge coincided with Lammens progressing from the academy to their first team, so he is uniquely positioned to provide insight into United's new goalkeeper signing.",
      "Lammens joined Club Brugge's academy when he was 12. \"He was a guy with huge potential,\" said Milkon. \"As I learned from colleagues who had worked with him when he was much younger, I heard there was a moment that clicked in his head when he became super professional.",
      "\"He was one of the guys during Covid - when the players were not able to train - who was doing a lot at home, he was really going far with this to be the best in these types of areas.",
      "\"Then he continued like this when he joined the first team to train with them. He always wanted to improve. We also had something in place to look at the parameters on which goalkeepers are judged.",
      "\"You see the potential of the goalkeeper based on what they do in games; so their positioning, their decision-making and so on, and Senne was always quite high in these areas.",
      "\"The only bad luck that he had was that the first-team goalkeeper was Simon Mignolet. He's an amazing goalkeeper, so it was difficult for Senne to stay over there in the role of No.2.",
      "\"That would have also blocked his growth, so it was good for him in the end to make the step to go to Antwerp and he did a tremendous job there. It was amazing to see how fast he adapted.\"",
      "Milkon pictured during his stint with Club Brugge (he now manages F.C.V. Dender).",
      "Milkon continued: \"I think for us at Club Brugge, it was very clear to everyone that Senne was a top goalkeeper. He would have been the perfect fit for Club Brugge to be the No.1.",
      "\"That was not possible because Mignolet was there. But the parameters that we used to judge his performances indicated he was ticking so many boxes already, and he was consistently doing it.",
      "\"There weren't ups and downs with his performances. He was consistently really high and when you compare this to the top goalkeepers, you have a benchmark to say 'Ok, what potential does this guy have?'",
      "\"He had some chances with the first team at Club Brugge and made a mistake, or maybe two, but in the end it was very clear to everyone that he was a top goalkeeper.",
      "\"It was impossible to try to extend his contract because, again, you have Mignolet, and you cannot block a guy like this. You know he has to go out, he has to play, and he will improve even more.\"",
      "When asked about Lammens' strengths, he said: \"I would say that his decision-making was very good. He is very calm, he sees the solutions on the pitch, he has a quick reaction time and understands the balance between risk and reward, and which decisions are the right ones to make.",
      "\"His clean passing is great, his footwork was really good, and he's just an amazing goalkeeper with the shot-stopping. He made some incredible saves back then already. He's quite a complete goalkeeper.",
      "\"But making the right decisions at a very young age, being very mature with this, was really impressive. And the fact that he is good with both feet is another big strength.",
      "\"For me, Senne is a very calm guy and has all the qualities to be a top professional. That was my impression when I first met him when he was younger and he never changed.\"",
      "A baby-faced Lammens playing for Club Brugge in 2021. (Image: 2021 BSR Agency)",
      "Lammens joined Royal Antwerp on a free transfer in the summer of 2023. He was handed his debut a few months later and served as an understudy that season, but earned first-choice status for 2024/2025.",
      "His performances drew attention from the Belgian media. Lammens saved four penalties across a successful first full campaign and received a call-up to Belgium's senior squad in March.",
      "Milkon said: \"I was not surprised when I saw Manchester United had come calling. And to record his first clean sheet, I was really happy for him. Senne is a potential No.1 for the Red Devils - the Belgium national team.",
      "\"He got his chance, he took it, and we're all really proud of him, but we knew it would happen. I believe he has all the capabilities to become the best in the world, so I wish him all the best. I'm sure he will have a very good career in England, and Manchester United should return to the big club they used to be.",
      "\"He will have a positive impact on that, for sure, and hopefully he will be Belgium's first-choice goalkeeper soon. I believe he has the potential, the skillset and the personality to do that.",
      "\"For me, it was just having a tiny little part in having an influence on him at Brugge, but it was the most positive memories of our relationship that we had during this spell.",
      "\"I'm very proud that he is reaching these high levels and not surprised. I believe he will be successful because he is a guy who will not change his focus or start to do something different. He is calm, that's his personality and character, and he wants to succeed. He is hungry and will keep working to be his best.",
      "\"He is so calm, and you have to be patient in football. You cannot worry too much and want things too early, but finding the balance between not being impatient and, at the same time, pushing and demanding what you deserve in a good way, means everything will sort itself out.\"",
      "Lammens in action for Royal Antwerp in 2024. (Image: Photonews 2024)",
      "United staff who have worked with Lammens at Carrington have echoed Milkon's sentiments. He has been described as \"really mature for his age\" and is said to have taken the move in his stride.",
      "Lammens is understood to have impressed coaches during training sessions and a United source said that lots of people have been speaking positively about him. He has already relocated from the luxury hotel where he was initially staying and into a house.",
      "It's no surprise that Lammens likes to play basketball at 6ft 3in, but he is a keen golfer, which is common ground with the likes of Tom Heaton, Luke Shaw, Mason Mount and Harry Maguire.",
      "Matthijs de Ligt, Amad, Maguire and Shaw jogged straight to Lammens to congratulate him after full-time against Sunderland. \"Are you Schmeichel in disguise?\" was chanted at Lammens from the Stretford End.",
      "It remains to be seen whether Lammens will start against Liverpool on Sunday, but it would be a surprise to see him on the bench after delivering a strong debut before the international break.",
      "There would be nothing boring about keeping another clean sheet - this time at Anfield.",
      "Kitbag has slashed the price of Man United kits and merch with up to 50% off select items.",

      "Beating Manchester City and Arsenal is fun. Very fun, in fact. It is a true statement and emphasises tactical nous against the best managers. But it’s your Fulhams, your Crystal Palaces, your Evertons that Michael Carrick has to beat.",
      "Ruben Amorim’s record against the ‘Big Six’ clubs wasn’t horrible. He won at the Etihad. He won at Anfield. He won at the Emirates (albeit after penalties). He beat Newcastle and Chelsea at Old Trafford this season. And in last season’s Europa League semi-finals, he smashed Athletic Bilbao 7-1 on aggregate.",
      "But his final game in charge was a score draw at Leeds United after losing at home to 10-man Everton, failing to beat Wolves, potentially the worst side in Premier League history, at home, and also drawing at home to an awful West Ham side. There seemed to be a new nadir every month.",
      "What Carrick has done effectively in his opening two weeks is the cliched Back To Basics thing. People often say managers must Go Back To Basics without actually knowing what that entails. Rondos and starting Kobbie Mainoo, apparently.",
      "Arsenal were punished by an effective counter-attacking team capable of taking their chances, big and small, a week after a convincing win over Manchester City.",
      "READ: 16 Conclusions from Arsenal 2-3 Man United: DNA, bottle, retro kits, Carrick, Arteta, Mbeumo and more",
      "On Sunday, Fulham faced Michael Carrick’s Manchester United as underdogs. It was the first time in three games the Red Devils were expected to win under Carrick’s watch, and they dealt with the pressure to pass a very important test by the skin of their teeth.",
      "United were absolutely not perfect, as the 3-2 scoreline suggests. They still gave up plenty of chances and conceded three times, one of which was ruled out by the narrowest of offsides.",
      "Carrick’s United are direct, even with Bryan Mbeumo up front by himself. They feed off second balls and counter effectively. Sometimes they defend well too. Other times, the club’s modern-day DNA comes through.",
      "Raul Jimenez’s late penalty set up a nervous ending and United did sh*t the bed as Kevin’s beauty levelled the scoring. But it was that good old United DNA that saved them as substitute Benjamin Sesko popped up with a fantastic 94th-minute winner.",
      "It was an important test for Carrick but also an important lesson. Chelsea and Liam Rosenior learned that resting your best players is dangerous, and Carrick learned that taking them off, even at 2-0, is also pretty dangerous.",
      "Casemiro, Ruben Amorim’s biggest success story, continues to impress and staked a claim for the club to extend his contract beyond this summer with a goal and an assist. However, the control United had was lost when he came off. The Brazilian has come a long way from that night at Selhurst Park, becoming an indispensable player who apparently can’t miss any minutes whatsoever.",
      "His goal was an outstanding back-post header from a Bruno Fernandes free-kick following a Jorge Cuenca shirt-pull on Matheus Cunha, which United initially thought was going to be a penalty after Cuenca’s sliding tackle on Cunha. The replays suggested a goal kick was more likely, and we’re sure Marco Silva will have something very interesting to say.",
      "Goal contributions aside, it was a commanding midfield performance from Casemiro. He and Mainoo provide a lovely balance in the middle of the park, and with Bruno Fernandes in front of them? Chef’s kiss.",
      "For Carrick, it has genuinely been a case of playing your best players in their best positions and standing in the technical area with your hands behind your back as a well-functioning XI do their thing. And from now on, he will play his best players for even longer. Amazingly, that is a better idea than bringing on Manuel Ugarte.",
      "While it was a scare for United and could have prompted a very different reaction from us, Carrick’s perfect start continued. It was comfortable for the most part against weaker opposition in good form, which tells us more about Carrick and United’s credentials than wins against the Premier League’s top two, especially when these were the fixtures the previous manager struggled with most.",
      "It’s two wins from two at Old Trafford and an away win against the league leaders, who hadn’t lost at home all season before United’s brilliant 3-2 victory. That also happened to be the first time Arsenal and their rock-solid defence have conceded three goals in a match since December 2023.",
      "Two whole calendar years without conceding three goals in a game is quite something. For all the talk of Arsenal capitulating, Carrick deserves huge credit for that victory, not just the brilliant start he has made.",
      "Aston Villa might want to look over their shoulder as Carrick’s United soar. The players look confident and settled. Everyone is contributing. The partnerships are working well all over the pitch. For once, it actually looks like a football team enjoying themselves and a group of players who genuinely like each other.",
      "They are simply functioning after looking completely and utterly lost a month ago. Carrickball is cooking. That’s what the cool kids say, right?",

It was criminal that Slot dropped him as soon as Isak was fit; that decision also coincided with our horrendous down turn in form but I suspect that correlation rather than causation. If he were to do so again then I think fans would riot. Hugo has earned that spot right now and it should be his to keep; everyone else in this team needs to find a place around him in my opinion.",
      "The Mo drop off is so sad to watch and so hard to understand. He was through and clear on goal and forgot to curve his run to bring him closer to goal. In the end Trippier just took it off him. Is he fully devoid of confidence or just downing tools until Slot is gone? His lack of output combined with Gakpo is probably why we have struggled so much this season. Today Gakpo had these flashes driving into space but then had zero output or clue of what to do every time. He seems so out of sync with the team; once he raced into the box and then to the byline and crossed it at chest level for a defender to clear when he could’ve rolled it on the floor two touches earlier into feet for a finish.",

      "Dubravka was an inspired summer signing and without him, Burnley would be further adrift. The 37-year-old has been the busiest keeper, facing 32 shots on target more than anyone else.",

      "The giant Georgian just scrapes in having played five games when Alisson was injured and Liverpool were caving in after a flying start. Apparently, half of the 10 goals Mamardashvili conceded were saveable, but he performed above expectation on a third of the shots he saved.",

      "Raya has faced 52 shots on target, at least a dozen fewer than any other regular No.1, considerably fewer than any other keeper, but the fact the Spaniard is fifth for shots saved above expectation indicates he has been a reliable presence when called upon.",
      "A very mixed season for Sels after sharing the Golden Glove last term. Sean Dyche toyed with replacing the Belgian but Big John blew it.",
      "You can’t blame Vicario for looking unsettled behind that Spurs side but he has been caught up in the chaos too often, even if the stats suggest he remains one the Premier League’s better shotstoppers.",
      "The numbers suggest Pickford has been something of a contradiction. He has made the third-highest number of big saves and is fifth for shots on target saved, but he has conceded the second-highest number of saveable goals (14). Still England’s No.1.",
      "The Netherlands No.1 continues to catch eyes, with Bayern Munich and Tottenham both credited with an interest in the Seagulls stopper. Scrapes into the Premier League power rankings top 30.",
      "A very middle-of-the-road season so far from Henderson, who needed his best yet if he hoped to dislodge Pickford in the England goal in time for the World Cup. May get plenty of opportunities to impress before then since Palace have sold their captain and best defender.",
      "MORE PREM RANKINGS: Best passers under pressure | Most tackle-proof players",
      "May have felt aggrieved to give up the gloves when Lucas Perri returned but Darlow is rightfully back in the Leeds goal. Not because he’s demonstrably better, rather he’s certainly no worse.",
      "There have been occasions this season when Leno was less than his usual reliable self, evidenced by the fact that no keeper has conceded more saveable goals (16).",
      "Anything less chaotic than Andre Onana was always going to make a huge difference to United and Lammens has been a calming, reliable presence. A top-class keeper? We’ll see…",
      "The Brentford stopper was conceding too many goals that perhaps he shouldn’t at the start of the season while settling into his first job as a No.1, but Kelleher looks more at ease in the role now.",
      "Petrovic, like Bournemouth collectively, began the season well but had a major wobble at the back end of the 2025.",
      "Performed slightly better than Pope but not enough to make Eddie Howe consider a permanent change.",
      "Hasn’t been consistent enough to silence the doubters, and the fact Liam Rosenior admits he is asking Sanchez to do things that may be unfamiliar with suggests Chelsea will be looking for a new keeper in the summer. There’s a good one going free in Italy.",
      "Below Ramsdale for shotstopping here, but many Newcastle fans were happy to see Pope return upon return from injury.",
      "Don’t shoot the messenger, Sunderland fans. We agree, Roefs has been superb.",
      "Alisson is usually a rock-solid presence for Liverpool but the Brazilian, not long ago viewed by many as the world’s best, has struggled to stop the Reds’ rot. Is it time to give Mamardashvili a longer run?",
      "Initially taken out of the firing line because of injury, then dropped after a series of soft goals culminating in the latest-ever Premier League winner.",

      "According to reports, Manchester United captain Bruno Fernandes has made a new ‘transfer decision’ amid interest from European and Saudi Pro League sides.",
      "Fernandes has consistently been Man Utd’s best performer in recent years as he is arguably their sole world-class player.",
      "United‘s captain has carried the broken club on his back during their recent dark times, but it has been widely reported that he could be on borrowed time at Old Trafford.",
      "Last summer, it was reported that Man Utd were looking to cash in on Fernandes to fund their rebuild, so a move to Saudi Pro League side Al-Hilal looked likely.",
      "Fernandes eventually decided to remain at Man Utd, but he hinted in a recent interview that he is not completely happy with the board’s treatment of him.",
      "This has fuelled fresh speculation regarding a possible exit from Man Utd, with Saudi Pro League teams and Bayern Munich mooted as potential destinations for the midfielder, who has sparkled in Michael Carrick’s first two games as interim boss.",
      "READ: Ballard, Stach to Man Utd: Ten Premier League newbies poised for pillaging",
      "However, a new report from Football Insider journalist Pete O’Rourke claims Fernandes’ latest ‘transfer decision’ is that he has ‘no plans to move to the Saudi Pro League at this stage of his career as he aims to continue playing at the highest level possible’.",
      "“I think he can definitely stay beyond this summer. He’s under contract until 2027, and there’s an option in that deal, as well, to extend it,” O’Rourke told Football Insider.",
      "“If he was to become available, there’s no doubt that there would be clubs interested in him.",
      "“We know that obviously there has been interest from the Saudi Pro League before, but I’m not sure that Fernandes is ready to move there at this stage of his career. He still wants to play at the highest level.“",
      "Man Utd legend Teddy Sheringham has admitted that he has concerns about Fernandes, even though it would be a “huge loss” if he moved elsewhere in the summer.",
      "“In terms of Bruno [Fernandes] you’re looking at two different things,” Sheringham told Bet MGM.",
      "“You’re looking at him as captain material and whether he’s an identity which is what the club stands for. I don’t think he’s that because he doesn’t lead by example in his manner on the pitch.",
      "“We’ve seen him throw his arms up in the air and all that which I don’t think is a good look and not something a captain should be doing.",
      "“Don’t get me wrong, the way he’s performed on the pitch over the last couple of years, he’s definitely a type of leader but I’m not sure he’s a captain.",
      "“There’s been a lot of speculation about his future. First of all, you don’t want to lose your top players and without a doubt, Bruno has been one of Manchester United’s top performers over the last two-and-a-half years in a team full of players who have been underperforming.",
      "“I don’t listen too much to speculation but, of course, he’d be a huge loss if he did move on at the end of the season.”",
      "According to reports, Real Madrid ‘want’ Manchester United captain Bruno Fernandes and it’s claimed that he could replace Jude Bellingham.",
      "If you stop Bruno Fernandes, you go a long way towards stopping Man Utd. But the stats prove how hard it is to subdue the Red Devils captain…",
      "Man Utd would need an “astronomical offer” to convince Chelsea to sell Cole Palmer with transfer rumblings “getting louder”, according to reports.",
      "New information has emerged on Bruno Fernandes’ future at Manchester United, including a no-brainer decision and a ‘significant’ demand for a new contract.",
      "Arsenal’s 1-0 win over Man Utd in August gave a false perception of where each club was headed, so I have revisited ten of our conclusions from that game…",
      "According to reports, Manchester United captain Bruno Fernandes could join Saudi Pro League side Al-Hilal in the coming months via a ‘historic offer’."

      "That makes Sterling a free-agent but sees him lose his status as one of the Premier League’s highest-paid players.",
      "It also leaves Chelsea without an entry in the top 10, which is dominated by Manchester City and Liverpool.",
      "This ranking is based on base salary only – no bonuses included – with most figures sourced from Capology.",
      "",
      "10) Kai Havertz (Arsenal) – £280,000 a week\nArsenal had to give Havertz a little bump up when they signed him from Chelsea, where he was already on a quarter of a million per week. That sweetener adds up to £1.5million a year.",
      "",
      "9) Alexander Isak (Liverpool) – £280,000 a week\nIsak is being paid £14.56m a year, an increase of 133 per cent on the £120,000-a-week salary he was trousering at Newcastle. Which is not unreasonable since his agent can point to Isak’s status as British football’s most-expensive player. Which he will have to justify when he’s back from injury.",
      "",
      "8) Omar Marmoush (Manchester City) – £295,000 a week\nThe first of four Manchester City entries in the top 10 and perhaps one of the more surprising names on the list. His agent played a blinder when he moved to City because the striker was only on just north of £33,000 a week at Eintracht Frankfurt.",
      "",
      "7) Jack Grealish (Manchester City/Everton) – £300,000 a week\nIt is no surprise to see Grealish on such an extraordinary salary since it was negotiated when he became English football’s first £100million purchase, before Pep Guardiola had sussed that he didn’t fancy the star after all. Grealish joined Everton on loan, with the Toffees liable for £225,000 a week, making him their highest-paid player by a margin of £100,000 a week, while City top up the rest. So it’s especially sickening for the Merseysiders that he may miss the rest of the season.",
      "",
      "6) Bruno Fernandes (Manchester United) – £300,000 a week\nUnited probably wept weekly when similar amounts left their coffers to be deposited into Jadon Sancho and Marcus Rashford’s accounts but Fernandes is more than worth it to the Red Devils. Without him, things would have been even bleaker.",
      "5) Bernardo Silva (Manchester City) – £300,000 a week\nSilva is in the final season of his £15.6million-a-year salary at City. The Portugal star reportedly doubled his money when he signed a new contract in 2023.",
      "",
      "4) Virgil van Dijk (Liverpool) – £350,000 a week\nVan Dijk is on almost double the salary he signed for when joining Liverpool in 2018. Few would argue the captain hasn’t been worth his money up to this season, but it is now a matter for debate.",
      "",
      "3) Casemiro (Manchester United) – £350,000 a week\nUnited almost doubled Casemiro’s Real Madrid wage and, at first, he looked good value for money. Then…he did not. The Brazilian is earning his coin again but only until the summer when there will be no renewal.",
      "",
      "2) Mo Salah (Liverpool) – £400,000 a week\nLiverpool fans were relieved earlier this year to see Salah end a season-long saga by putting pen to paper for two more years. A £2.6million-a-year pay rise was viewed as more than worth it to keep the Egyptian around – and to spare the cost of replacing him – but half a season later, we’re considerably less sure.",
      "",
      "1) Erling Haaland (Manchester City) – £525,000 a week\nWe’re told that there were months of negotiations before Haaland signed his deal for 10 (TEN) seasons which makes us wonder: where the hell was his agents’ starting point?! It is obviously a very cushy deal for Haaland, but also a massive ‘f*** you’ from City to, well, everyone.",

      "Liverpool fans are united in thinking it’s time for Mo Salah to leave, while we have cautiously optimistic Man Utd fans and more.",
      "Mohamed Salah’s move from Liverpool to Saudi Arabia could be in jeopardy as the Pro League have changed their transfer policy, according to reports.",
      "Salah’s future at Liverpool looks set to be determined by whether Slot continues beyond this season amid talk of an Alonso ‘done deal’.",
      "Xabi Alonso has revealed three demands if Liverpool want him to become their new boss with claims it’s ‘practically a done deal’, according to reports.",

There are few more reliable fixtures for some kind of nonsense or other, and Spurs – the 14th best team in England but the fourth best in all of Europe – are currently in the mood for delivering piping hot nonsense at frankly dangerous levels.",
      "Liverpool, too, would quite like to add some of their continental brio to their domestic offerings, while DNA-powered Man United reviver Michael Carrick must now prove he can do it in the non-blockbuster Sunday 2pm slot.",
      "",
      "You know what’s going to happen, don’t you? We know it, you know it, Pep Guardiola knows it. Thomas Frank probably doesn’t know it, but he doesn’t know much of anything these days.",
      "But yes, obviously, Spurs are obviously going to win this game. Rarely if ever has the fundamental paradox of Tottenham-City games applied more than it does here, to wit: the less likely a Tottenham win logically appears to be, the more likely it is to happen.",
      "And right now a Tottenham win in any game – obviously this only applies to any game of proper football in a difficult competition, not tish and fipsy like the Champions League – is a highly illogical outcome.",
      "Spurs have just come through the gentlest imaginable run of fixtures, a January of almost cartoonish ease with which to get themselves back into contention for the European spots, and somehow come out the other side of it in the heat of a proper relegation battle having won not a single one of their last five Premier League games. They’ve lost back-to-back against two teams whose winless Premier League runs extended to double figures before their appointment with the good doctor, and coming minutes away from making that three on the bounce at Burnley.",
      "Meanwhile they’ve been casually winning games in Europe like it’s nothing. In the last three months, Spurs have now won twice as many Champions League games (4) as they have Premier League ones (2).",
      "A team that now, as an apparent point of principle, insists upon conceding at least two stupid and easily preventable goals in every single Premier League match they play has kept more clean sheets in the Champions League than anyone else.",
      "This is Spurs heritage. This is what they do. Spursy has never been purely about the spectacular ability for the disastrous and humiliating; it has always required the ability to occasionally and often entirely inexplicably hit absurd heights to make the pratfalls so much bigger and funnier.",
      "And for many years now, Man City have been a key punching bag along the way in the set-up for whatever nonsense Spurs are building up to. While for the last couple of seasons Spurs have perfected this wonderful new bit of being a clinical force in Europe but worse than ever before domestically, they’ve quite rightly never abandoned the ever-bankable ‘improbable victory over Pep Guardiola’s Man City’ bit.",
      "They’ve won their last two trips to the Etihad 4-0 and 2-0, and also knocked City out of the Carabao last season.",
      "This latest instalment is unfortunately at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, where Burnley and Brentford remain the only Premier League teams this season to leave empty-handed, but does come with added banter potential from not just Spurs’ own stupid form but the fact last weekend’s results have got City right back on Arsenal’s coat-tails in the title race.",
      "It’s still a bit early in the season for it to become a true repeat of the great 23/24 final-week showpiece, especially with Spurs so uncomfortably close to the bottom three. But it is nevertheless a game that has either a win-win or lose-lose element to it for Spurs, depending on your outlook.",
      "And it gives us the latest chance to wheel out one of our very favourite stats. Since Wolves returned to the top flight in 2018/19, Spurs have taken 18 points from their 15 Premier League games against them. Over that exact time period, Spurs have 23 points from 15 Premier League games against Man City.",
      "Now we know Wolves were quite good for some of that time, but for a lot of that time City were the most relentless collector of Premier League points Our League has ever known. Yet Spurs hold a 7-6 winning record against them over a time period that includes only the very last not-very-good-actually bits of the Pochettino era and all the awful crud that’s followed. And we’ve not even mentioned the infamous Champions League quarter-final.",
      "We have no idea why it keeps happening as often as it does, but we can only assume it will keep happening for as long as Spurs remain so resolutely, utterly and determinedly Spurs.",
      "",
      "Spurs aren’t the only team using the Champions League to mask their domestic failings, with Liverpool managing to even finish above the all-conquering European night Lilywhites after thrashing Qarabag to finish third in the standings and achieve some level of cathartic release after the loss of the most misleading unbeaten run on record with that late defeat at Bournemouth.",

It’s a rather neat marker of Villa’s rise that Abraham’s season at Villa Park in 2018/19 involved scoring 25 goals to get them out of the Championship, and he will have rather different targets for the remainder of this campaign.",
      "Watkins’ injury makes Abraham potentially an even more important signing even more quickly for a team whose sheer lack of alternatives goes some way to explaining why Watkins was being used in such a low-wattage game in the first place.",

      "In his pre-match press conference ahead of the game against Manchester City, Thomas Frank said Xavi Simons needed to translate his Champions League performances domestically. He certainly did that.",
      "The Dutchman was the biggest beneficiary of the 3-4-3 system that was forced to turn to due to the injuries that have plagued the squad. With the wide wing-backs pushing up, it gave Simons ample space inside to operate in areas he is dangerous in.",
      "More often than not, he was the go-to for Spurs as they transitioned from defence into attack. His neat footwork was at times a joy and his weight of pass was more often than not, exemplary.",
      "Having said that, the most impressive thing was his tenacity. He never gave up a fight for possession. He showed the grit needed in tough and physical Premier League games, and lived to tell the tale.",
      "This was somewhat of a coming our performance for Simons, whose quality was never questioned, but was a case of if it was suited to English football.",
      "In perhaps one of the most difficult games Spurs will have this season with regards to the pressure they are under and the opposition they found themselves against, an unsung hero stepped up and epitomised what Spurs' comeback was all about.Callum Bishop",
      "Morgan Gibbs-White was named man of the match as 10-man Nottingham Forest held Crystal Palace to a draw but Elliot Anderson was an equally deserving candidate.",
      "The 23-year-old showed all sides of his game in a complete performance which underlined, again, his status as one of the Premier League's top central midfielders.",
      "His best work came in possession in the first half as he demonstrated his technical ability and passing range, sending Forest forward on the attack repeatedly.",
      "He continued to show his on-ball value even after Neco Williams' sending-off. No Forest player had more touches or made more passes over the course of the 90 minutes. Anderson even completed all five of his attempted dribbles.",
      "But he was just as influential defensively after the break. Anderson snapped into challenges and played a crucial role in frustrating Palace, working tirelessly, cajoling and instructing team-mates.",
      "In total, he won possession 10 times, the highest total by any player on either side. He was also successful in 12 of his 14 duels. An outstanding all-round performance from a player getting better all the time.Nick Wright",
      "The draw against Nottingham Forest extended Crystal Palace's winless run to nine in the Premier League and 12 in all competitions. Shelbourne were the last team they beat, all the way back on December 11.",
      "But while that is miserable, arguably more concerning is their struggles in front of goal.",
      "Across those last 12, they have scored nine, with three scored from the penalty spot. That equates to a goal from open play every other game.",
      "Even with the absence of Jean-Philippe Mateta - who was left out of the squad owing to the speculation around his future - Palace should probably have put more than an Ismaila Sarr penalty past Matz Sels - and half-time replacement Angus Gunn. Their hosts were reduced to 10 after a mindless handball from Neco Williams.",
      "But despite having 74 per cent of the possession after the break, they just couldn't. In fact, in the second half, they recorded only 0.22 xG and did not even muster a single shot on target.",
      "Right now, Mateta's future remains up in the air ahead of Deadline Day, but Palace have had a bid for Jorgen Strand Larsen totalling £48m accepted by Wolves. Providing that deal goes through without a hitch, they will need him to be firing from the off.Dan Long",
      "Aston Villa welcomed Douglas Luiz and Tammy Abraham back to the club this week and the duo went straight into the starting line-up against Brentford.",
      "This wasn't a nod to their talents, although both looked bright in flashes. It was evidence of the strain Unai Emery's squad is currently under.",
      "Captain John McGinn and top goalscorer Ollie Watkins both watched on from the stands due to injury, with Boubacar Kamara and Youri Tielemans joining them on the sidelines.",
      "Club-record singing Amadou Onana also wasn't fit enough to feature, despite being named on the bench.",
      "The injury crisis continues to sweep the club and faltering against the 10 men of Brentford highlighted that lack of depth.",
      "Arsenal know more than anyone how injuries can impact a team pushing at the top of the table.",
      "A seven-point gap to Liverpool in sixth remains after this defeat but moving forward, Villa might need to pay closer attention to those behind them rather than Arsenal at the top.Patrick Rowe",

      "Our football betting expert Jones Knows provides his insight across the Premier League weekend.",
      "This is one of those prices that makes you stop, wash your face with cold water and check you're reading it correctly.",
      "Aston Villa to win at 21/20 with Sky Bet feels very generous considering what this team have been telling us for months.",
      "Since going winless in their opening five Premier League games, Villa have been nothing short of elite. They've taken 43 points from 18 matches, title-challenger output no doubt and no side in the division have collected more points over that period. That's not a short hot streak either. It's a sample of results to respect. It's sustained excellence.",
      "Brentford, meanwhile, remain a side you want to oppose on their travels. Only bottom club Wolves have suffered more away defeats in the Premier League this season (8). Home win.",
      "There is no better attacker of a set-piece in world football than Harry Maguire. And in a Premier League season where dead-ball situations are being mined relentlessly for goals, Maguire is going to get his feed soon enough.",
      "Back in the Manchester United starting XI, Maguire is playing with an authority that has shone brightly in the last two performances. That confidence can translate to when he ventures forward. Maguire's old-school dominance remains a potent betting weapon and the 7/1 with Sky Bet for him to score is worth jumping on.",
      "There's a strong whiff of needle about this one. There's lingering animosity in the air after the summer legal battles which ended in Forest replacing Palace in the Europa League and when you layer in the relegation context, emotions are likely to be running hot. That's usually when the card markets come alive.",
      "One match-up in particular looks primed to deliver.",
      "Neco Williams is expected to lock horns with Ismaila Sarr, and that's a tough afternoon for any full-back. Sarr is relentless in one-vs-one situations, drives straight at defenders and forces decisions at pace. The data is damning from a defensive perspective as Sarr has drawn 21 cards from opponents since the start of last season, with only Bruno Guimaraes responsible for more in the Premier League.",
      "Williams looks a bet material at 100/30 with Sky Bet to be carded in an edgy game.",
      "There's no escaping the strange relationship between these two. Spurs have won seven of the last 12 meetings and Pep Guardiola has lost more Premier League games against Tottenham (8) than any other opponent. On paper, that history screams Tottenham.",
      "And when you see Spurs at 100/30 with Sky Bet, the temptation is obvious. But Spurs at home remain impossible to trust.",
      "Instead of fighting the uncertainty, the smarter route is to isolate a player who can still profit from Spurs doing some things right and that's where Dominic Solanke to score at 11/4 with Sky Bet comes to the party.",
      "He's become something of a forgotten man, but Solanke is built to score in the Premier League. Goals in back-to-back games is a reminder of his talents.",
      "There's also a bigger-picture motivation edge at play. With England's forward depth in focus, Solanke knows he's fighting to be a potential Harry Kane understudy this summer for England at the World Cup.",
      "Sunderland remain the only Premier League team unbeaten at home this season. That is wild.",
      "But trends do snap and, in betting, timing when to step in to profit from such a run ending is a key weapon to use when trying to profit in this game. It's 19/5 with Sky Bet to end here - a price on a Burnley win that is too big to pass up.",
      "The absence of Granit Xhaka is pivotal. We saw exactly how fragile Sunderland can be without their midfield reference point in their worst performance of the season away at West Ham. Without Xhaka's control, leadership and ability to dictate tempo, Sunderland lost structure, lost composure and were far too easy to play through.",
      "Burnley need wins now. So their approach will be positive and the market is dangling a very juicy carrot towards us regarding their win prospects."

      "Michael Carrick will go for a third consecutive win as Man Utd head coach against Fulham on Super Sunday and goalkeeper Senne Lammens has a big role to play; The Radar column also reveals the passing stats that set Aston Villa's Ezri Konsa apart",
      "Sunday 1 February 2026 07:04, UK",
      "",
      "🔴 Lammens brings calm to Man Utd💪 Konsa's passing under pressure🔍 A player to watch this weekend",
      "Manchester United beat Arsenal last Sunday with the help of two moments of brilliance from Matheus Cunha and Patrick Dorgu. But their goalkeeper played his part too, albeit in typically understated style. Senne Lammens continues to impress.",
      "The 23-year-old, an £18m signing from Royal Antwerp, has looked good value ever since his debut in October, when he kept a clean sheet in a 2-0 win over Sunderland at Old Trafford, instantly bringing a level of calm Altay Bayindir and Andre Onana lacked.",
      "Certainly, it is what Manchester United needed, and Lammens has brought plenty more besides. The various ways in which he has improved the side were neatly outlined at the Emirates Stadium as he helped Michael Carrick make it two wins from two.",
      "Firstly, there were examples of his shot-stopping ability, most notably in the first half, when he produced an outstanding reflex save to push Martin Zubimendi's close-range header over the bar. He later got down smartly to deny Bukayo Saka at his near post.",
      "The underlying data shows that, excluding own goals, Lammens has conceded 21 goals from chances worth an expected total of 23.74 since his arrival in the Premier League, giving him a chunky positive differential of nearly three goals prevented across 15 games.",
      "It is a considerable improvement on Bayindir, whose shot-stopping is deemed to be one of his stronger attributes but who had a negative differential for goals prevented across his six starts in the early weeks of the season, according to the same data.",
      "Lammens has proved useful with his feet as well as his hands, particularly over long distances.",
      "He sent 33 of his 36 passes long against Arsenal, having sent 11 out of 13 long in the 2-0 win over Manchester City. Overall this season, Lammens has sent the fourth-highest percentage of passes long among Premier League goalkeepers at 66.15 per cent.",
      "The increased emphasis on directness is a welcome change given the issues United previously encountered when trying to play out from the back under Carrick's predecessor Ruben Amorim.",
      "Lammens' passes, which are usually struck with precision and travel with flat trajectories, serve several functions, allowing Manchester United to bypass their opponents' press and secure territory higher up the pitch by winning headers or second balls.",
      "At the Emirates Stadium, Lammens was able to drop his passes over the top of Arsenal's defensive line repeatedly, meaning Gabriel and William Saliba had to contend with aerial duels and off-the-ball runs in behind simultaneously, often while back-peddling.",
      "Despite his relative inexperience, Lammens has handled the step up to a role once described by Neville as the most difficult in football impressively. He has gone from facing Beerschot and Westerlo to Manchester City and Arsenal in the space of a year.",
      "He had, of course, demonstrated considerable potential in Belgium. But if there was one area of uncertainty coming to the Premier League, it was how he might handle the aerial side of things.",
      "\"The most important and most difficult thing, especially as a goalkeeper, is the set-pieces,\" he added to Neville in December. \"That's unique to England, the physicality. They try to block you, they make it as difficult as they can for you.\"",
      "Lammens was beaten from one such set-piece against Arsenal, unable to claim Saka's corner before it was prodded over the line by Mikel Merino. But he otherwise stood up to the challenge well, confidently commanding his box in difficult circumstances.",
      "In fact, he finished the game having made more catches and punches than any other goalkeeper against Arsenal all season. His combined total of six was the fourth-highest by a goalkeeper in any Premier League fixture so far this term.",
      "It all adds up to a level of security in goal that Manchester United have not had since the departure of David De Gea. Onana made three errors leading directly to goals last season in the Premier League, according to Opta. Lammens, by contrast, is yet to even make one leading to a shot.",
      "Quiet reliability does not generate many headlines. Lammens is a calm character off the pitch as well as on it. \"I understand I might come across as boring,\" he said in an interview in Belgium in October, \"but that's the goalkeeper I want to be.\"",
      "And it is exactly the goalkeeper Manchester United needed.",
      "Ezri Konsa's second-half introduction from the bench helped Aston Villa come from behind to beat Red Bull Salzburg in the Europa League on Thursday. The centre-back brought his usual composure on the ball, completing all but one of his 20 passes.",
      "His reliability in possession is one of many strengths and it applies even in challenging circumstances. In the Premier League this season, Konsa has completed 448 out of 492 passes when under high-intensity pressure, giving him a higher accuracy rate than any other player in the division at 91 per cent.",
      "The 28-year-old is having an outstanding season, pushing his claim to an England starting spot alongside Marc Guehi at this summer's World Cup, helped by a level of technical ability and press-resistance to match his quality defensively.",
      "The last column examined the striker situation at Arsenal as Gabriel Jesus, Viktor Gyokeres and the returning Kai Havertz vie for the No 9 shirt, and explained why the latter is still top dog.",

      "Arne Slot has talked about Liverpool's issues against low blocks and they are not the only Premier League side struggling to break down deep-lying opponents; Between the Lines digs into the data to reveal the teams with the best and worst numbers",
      "By Nick Wright, Adam Smith and David Fraser",
      "Friday 30 January 2026 10:27, UK",
      "Low blocks are a hot topic in the Premier League.",
      "The term refers to a defending team sitting deep in a compact shape to protect their goal and restrict space in central areas, making it difficult for their opponent to create chances.",
      "Which teams come up against low blocks most frequently? And which teams are most and least effective when it comes to playing against them? Between the Lines digs into the numbers.",
      "Arne Slot was told to stop talking about low blocks by Steven Gerrard after Liverpool's Champions League win over Marseille.",
      "The data supports Slot's comments on low blocks.",
      "This season, Liverpool have a higher percentage of build-up phases of play against compact defences than any team in the Premier League, at 26 per cent.",
      "Arsenal are second, at 24 per cent, with Nottingham Forest and Newcastle third and fourth, on 23 and 22 per cent respectively.",
      "At the other end of the scale, Leeds have the lowest percentage of build-up phases against low blocks this season, at 14 per cent, just below Crystal Palace and Burnley at 15 per cent.",
      "Slot has bemoaned facing more low blocks than last season this term as Liverpool's opponents set up to frustrate them.",
      "Again, the data backs him up.",
      "Only Everton have experienced a bigger increase to the percentage of build-up phases against deep opposition this season.",
      "While Liverpool and Everton are facing low blocks more frequently, Manchester City are facing them less frequently.",
      "In fact, Pep Guardiola's side have the biggest negative differential among ever-present Premier League clubs this term, their percentage dropping from the highest in the Premier League last season at 27 per cent, to 21 per cent this term, putting them fifth.",
      "The dip reflects changes to the way they are attacking, as well as how teams are defending against them, with Guardiola having put more emphasis on directness this season.",
      "Aston Villa rank as by far the most effective team against low blocks.",
      "Helped by a succession of strikes from outside the box this season, Unai Emery's side have racked up 19 goals from phases of play against deep defences since the start of last term.",
      "It is three more than any other side has managed in the same timeframe, with Manchester City next on 16. Newcastle have also enjoyed some success, scoring 15 goals against low blocks.",
      "Excluding relegated and promoted sides, Brentford have scored the fewest goals against low blocks, with three.",
      "Aston Villa and Brentford also come out top and bottom respectively when factoring the number of times Premier League teams have come up against opponents in a low block.",
      "For context, Aston Villa's 19 goals since the start of last season have come from 1,717 build-up phases against compact defences, giving them an average considerably higher than any other Premier League side at 1.11 goals per 100 phases.",
      "Manchester City's 16 goals, meanwhile, have come from a far higher number of build-up phases against low blocks, at 2,676, giving them a much lower average of 0.60 per 100 phases.",
      "While Newcastle and Manchester United rank closest to Newcastle for goals per 100 build-up phases against deep defences, Liverpool and Arsenal sit closer to Brentford.",
      "Arsenal's issues become even clearer when looking at shot numbers.",
      "While Liverpool do at least get a decent amount of shots off against low blocks, their average of 9.9 per 100 phases of play putting them fourth among ever-present Premier League sides in the last two seasons, Mikel Arteta's side average the second-fewest, at just 7.8 shots per 100 phases of play.",
      "The data also suggests Chelsea struggle against low blocks, averaging only fractionally more shots than Arsenal at 8.1.",
      "Arsenal's lack of threat against low blocks was most recently apparent during Sunday's 3-2 loss to Manchester United at the Emirates Stadium, when the Gunners struggled to open up their opponent's defensive structure in open play.",
      "In contrast to Arsenal, Manchester United have averaged considerably more shots against low blocks than any other Premier League side since the start of last season, at 12.9 per 100 phases of play, showing they fare better at breaking them down.",
      "Why are so many Premier League strikers struggling this season? Last week's edition looked at the declining number of goals being scored by forwards and the reasons behind the trend.",
