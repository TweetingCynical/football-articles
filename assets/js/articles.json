      "Ruben Amorim has come through the international break, but now faces a crucial series of matches in his Manchester United career. The Portuguese boss has been under pressure this term as the club attempt to bounce back from last season's 15th-place finish.",
      "A win over Sunderland last time out provided the Red Devils coach with some breathing space, and United now sit 10th in the Premier League after recording three wins from their opening seven matches. It remains a far cry from the Red Devils' ambitions of the past that centred around challenging at the very top.",
      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe has preached patience over Amorim's future despite an uncertain start. The United co-owner believes success can be earned through a long-term plan and pointed towards a rival's progress in recent years.",
      "Ratcliffe said: \"Yes. That is where I would be. Three years. Because football is not overnight. It's three years. You also look at [Mikel] Arteta at Arsenal. He had a miserable time over the first couple of years.",
      "\"We have to be patient. We have a long-term plan. It isn't a light switch. You can't run a club like Manchester United on knee-jerk reactions to some journalist who goes off on one every week.\"",
      "That vote of confidence could yet mean little if United's upcoming games follow the same pattern as last year. Amorim will prepare his team to face Liverpool, Brighton, Nottingham Forest and Tottenham, a set of games he gained just a single point from.",
      "Liverpool lie in wait first at Anfield. United earned a draw in the fixture last season and even took the lead through Lisandro Martinez before Amad earned a point against their rivals.",
      "That was one of the better displays of the entire Amorim era and hinted at the long-term success the Portuguese boss could achieve.",
      "The results were less convincing against the other sides, though. A 3-1 defeat to the Seagulls in January sparked Amorim's assertion that \"We are the worst team maybe in the history of Manchester United\".",
      "Away matches against Forest and Spurs saw a pair of 1-0 defeats, with ex-United ace Anthony Elanga rubbing salt in the wounds when he scored at the City Ground. Tottenham, meanwhile, defeated United four times last season, including in the Europa League final.",
      "Improving upon those four results will hand the team a big boost before the next international break. And with defensive injury issues for a Liverpool side coming off the back of three defeats, there could be few better opportunities to cause an upset.",
      "A repeat of just one point from four games would see Amorim on 11 points from 11 matches. They had 15 points from their opening 11 outings when the former Sporting CP coach arrived at the club in November 2024.",
      "His predecessor Erik ten Hag was sacked after nine matches, having picked up 11 of those 15 points in their opening nine matches.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Manchester United remain hopeful of securing a deal to purchase land surrounding Old Trafford for their new stadium project.",
      "Back in March, United revealed ambitious proposals for a cutting-edge 100,000-capacity stadium, with co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe suggesting the scheme could be finished by 2030.",
      "The rail yard surrounding Old Trafford belongs to Freightliner and the site will be key to the plans for a new 100,000-capacity stadium. Andy Burnham, Greater Manchester's Mayor, had previously indicated that compulsory purchase powers might be employed to obtain the area if negotiations reach an impasse.",
      "During the summer, reports suggested Freightliner had valued the site at £350million, though Burnham dismissed that sum, stating: \"I think everyone should file that one away.\"",
      "United and Freightliner have continued talks and are progressing towards reaching an agreement, based on the most recent fans' forum minutes published on Wednesday.",
      "A United spokesperson commented: \"While Manchester United owns a significant portion of land around Old Trafford, it is not all in a single, continuous block.",
      "\"To accommodate the scale of the proposed new stadium – including a canopy – and to avoid disruption to the existing stadium during construction, we are working to secure additional land.",
      "\"We've been engaged in constructive discussions with neighbouring landholders and are optimistic about reaching mutually agreeable terms in the coming months.\"",
      "A United spokesperson said: \"Early design work has been intentionally paused until we have greater clarity on land assembly and fan requirements. As with other aspects of the project, we encourage fans to treat speculative media reports with caution.",
      "\"We remain excited by the vision set out by Foster + Partners for a new stadium at the heart of a wider regeneration of the Old Trafford area.",
      "\"We always said this was a conceptual design, with more detailed architectural work to follow. While we remain keen to advance as quickly as possible, the timetable is subject to progress on land assembly and financing, which depends on key stakeholders working together.\"",
      "The club has admitted that they can't deliver their ambitious vision for Old Trafford alone, and have been working closely with national and local government, as well as Trafford Council.",
      "It's also understood that the club and city region are aligned in their goal to bring significant fixtures from the FIFA Women's World Cup in 2035 to the stadium, including the final, as much of the regeneration of the area will have been completed by then.",

      "Matheus Cunha is content to feature in any role Manchester United boss Ruben Amorim assigns him to. The Portuguese manager has come under fire for refusing to budge from his tactical approach during a disappointing spell of results.",
      "Ever since Amorim arrived in Manchester, he has made it abundantly clear that his wing-backed 3-4-3 system is set in stone and won't be changing. Throughout a dreadful previous season and a troubling beginning to this campaign, with three losses from seven matches, he has encountered relentless pressure to alter his team's setup.",
      "Squad members have allegedly started questioning the formation, with much of the criticism focusing on how skipper Bruno Fernandes is deployed in an unsuitable deeper midfield role. Despite this, Amorim maintains that not even the Pope could convince him to switch tactics.",
      "Whilst it has been suggested that many of United's players are unimpressed by this stance, Cunha, who arrived from Wolves this summer in a £62.5million deal, has no concerns about his positioning and rejects the idea that his boss should modify his approach.",
      "\"I think that because I play for Manchester United and people follow me more on the pitch, they understand better how I play,\" Cunha told Globo.",
      "\"I think it's part of having that weight, which is a privilege. It's a weight that came after the Tokyo Olympics [for Brazil in 2021]. And if it means having that weight and becoming a champion, I think it's worth putting up with a little bit of confusion about where [I] play.",
      "\"I came to the national team with this stereotype of a number 9 shirt. I play my entire base as a midfielder, and when I became a professional, I encountered this world of 4-3-3. It seems like you have to adapt: either play centre-forward, winger, or 'eight'.",
      "\"They eliminated the midfielder position, and you have to adapt. But I see it positively, as it has given me experience, many more positions, and even more so in short-term tournaments with the national team. Having a versatile player is a huge help for any coach.",
      "\"What I was searching for as a person more than anything else, I'm slowly finding. You constantly want to improve; that's innate in human nature, but I can't help but stop and enjoy this moment.",
      "\"Feeling privileged to wear the jersey of one of the greatest clubs in the world... it's a spectacular personal moment. I have an incredible family, another little girl now, everyone is doing well and healthy. I'm enjoying all of this in a positive way.\"",
      "Amorim himself tackled the criticism last month with passion as his side wallowed in the Premier League's lower reaches. He told reporters: \"No, no, no. No one. Not even the Pope [could get me to change formation].",
      "\"This is my job. This is my responsibility. This is my life. There will be an evolution, but we need to make all the good steps. If I'm a player and I have a coach that, with a lot of pressure, it doesn't matter if he's all around the world, is saying: 'You need to change the system.' And I'm going to change. In this moment, they will look at me in a different way.\"",

      "Ex-Manchester United star Paul Parker is convinced that Ruben Amorim has a \"personal\" issue with Kobbie Mainoo, who continues to be used as a squad player and is yet to play a full Premier League match this season.",
      "Mainoo came through the ranks at Old Trafford and was handed his debut by Erik ten Hag. He immediately shone and by the end of his debut season scored a goal in the FA Cup final as United shocked Manchester City at Wembley.",
      "He went on to play for England as they made the final of Euro 2024, but since Ten Hag was replaced by Amorim his stock has fallen and his minutes have decreased. Mainoo failed to even get off the bench in the first two games and has since had to make do with substitute cameos.",
      "Amorim has taken to starting Casemiro, whose future at the club has previously been questioned, ahead of him despite the Brazilian being into his 30s. Bruno Fernandes is also being played in a deeper role, which doesn't suit his qualities, ahead of Mainoo.",
      "Parker maintains the matter must be personal as he told MyBettingSites: \"We also have to ask why Mainoo hasn’t been used in that midfield. Somewhere along the line because I’ve been looking at it, it has to be personal. It has to be personal and the truth has to be told somewhere. He doesn’t like him or he doesn’t like him as a player. It doesn’t make any sense at all.”",
      "Despite Mainoo's meteoric rise at Manchester there has been talk of him being moved on, in part motivated by the PSR benefits of selling an academy player. He would still command a hefty fee but United have a famed history of backing their young talent and Parker has warned against selling him, especially given what he produced early on.",
      "He said: “It would cause big problems if they allow Mainoo to go because he’s a local boy. But it’s not just about that, it’s about what he’s achieved in a short space of time and he hasn’t been given the time and the respect.”",
      "Amorim has been questioned on his use of Mainoo but has been open about the improvement he wants to see in his game. \"I believe a lot in Kobbie but some of you think that Kobbie Mainoo is already done. I think he can do so much better. He can improve in a lot,\" he said.",
      "Mainoo is also competing with the likes of Manuel Ugarte, who is another player struggling for minutes under Amorim. It was also well documented that those on the red side of Manchester wanted to sign a No 6 to go into the middle of the park, leading to their interest in Carlos Baleba.",
      "United's style under Amorim, which he's refused to veer from, requires legs in midfield and that has been cited as an issue with the current starting line-up in the early weeks of the season.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

Slot will be crossing his fingers that most of his team return from international duty unscathed.",

      "\"I will be surprised if he [Alisson] will be there for the first game after the international break. From there on things can go a bit faster or a bit slower. It's difficult to say the amount of days and weeks. For the upcoming games he will not be apart of us or the Brazil team.\"",

      "\"He's not in a good place, of course,\" Slot admitted. \"He tore his ACL which means that he will be out for around a year. Being so young, coming to a new country, playing so well in your first game, it's very hard to take the positives. You always try to look at the positive side and that is that he is still so young.",

      "For the moment, he remains open to any opportunity available to him and believes he could add something valuable to a club willing to take a chance. Jones refuses to have tunnel vision over his next steps.",
      "\"I don’t think there’s a right or wrong way,\" Jones told BetMGM, via Mail Online. \"People say to me go and take an Under 18s, some say go and be an assistant somewhere.",
      "\"Do I think I’m ready to become a manager? No. I’m not naive and daft enough to think I’m just going to walk into a job. It doesn’t work like that. I have to earn the right with steps and progression.",

If you don’t get results, I don’t care what length of contract you’re on – 10 years, two years, five years – there will be questions and you will be looked at.",
      "\"Sunderland (a 2-0 win before the international break) was probably the most complete performance I’ve seen from United this season in every department. But then you play Liverpool, your fierce rivals (on Sunday). If you don’t win there, you’ve got Brighton coming up and that’s not an easy game the way they’re playing at the minute.",
      "\"If you get a draw against Liverpool and then go and beat Brighton at home, you’ve gathered a bit of momentum and can they really kick on and use it as a catalyst to do something? How many times have we said that over the last six years? Would I like to see Amorim succeed, do really well in the back end of this season and maybe win a trophy? Of course.

      "Liverpool boss Arne Slot could be facing a defensive crisis ahead of Sunday's big clash with Manchester United - with two key players potentially missing from his back five. The Reds will be without their star goalkeeper Alisson Becker for the Anfield showdown after he picked up a hamstring injury in the 1-0 Champions League defeat at Galatasaray.",
      "Adding to Slot's woes is the uncertainty surrounding Ibrahima Konate, who suffered a thigh injury in the 2-1 Premier League loss at Chelsea before the international break. Despite joining the France squad, the defender played no part in their first match and returned to Merseyside early.",
      "With Giovanni Leoni already sidelined long term, this leaves Liverpool potentially down to just two fit senior centre-backs for the showdown against United - captain Virgil van Dijk and Joe Gomez.",
      "However, it's not all doom and gloom for Slot, as his midfield options are looking healthier, reports the Liverpool Echo.",
      "Ryan Gravenberch, who was substituted at half-time in the Netherlands' 4-0 victory over Finland, is expected to be fit for the weekend. His withdrawal was understood to be precautionary measure.",
      "Gravenberch's fellow midfielders Alexis Mac Allister and Dominik Szoboszlai also enjoyed successful international breaks. Mac Allister bagged a brace in Argentina's 6-0 thrashing of Puerto Rico, while Szoboszlai scored a last-minute equaliser for Hungary against Portugal.",
      "Mac Allister, who had a stellar season last year, helping the Reds clinch the Premier League title, admitted that his recent performance for Argentina was a much-needed confidence boost. He said: \"Scoring goals helps; it gives you confidence.",
      "\"Especially at a time when, personally, the season hasn't started in the best way. This helps to continue building confidence.\"",
      "In Slot's debut campaign as manager, Mac Allister, Szoboszlai and Gravenberch were his preferred midfield trio, and they were named in his starting line-up for the gut-wrenching defeat to Chelsea.",
      "However, with £116m summer recruit Florian Wirtz showing promise off the bench at Stamford Bridge, following his own challenging start to the season, Slot has some serious thinking to do ahead of their match against Man United.",
      "Former Liverpool midfielder Danny Murphy, however, believes Mac Allister should be the one to step aside.",
      "\"I would say at the moment, I would go with Szobozslai and Gravenberch in the middle,\" suggested Murphy, who netted 44 goals and provided 41 assists in249 appearances over seven seasons at Anfield.",
      "\"Two super athletic players who can cover lots of ground. And I'd put Wirtz ahead of them.",
      "\"Szobozslai can go towards the right and help the full-back defend when Mohamed Salah stays high because obviously he's been given the license to not defend. That was pretty evident in the Chelsea game although I do feel he could have defended a bit more. I think the athleticism of those two is what Liverpool needs\".",
      "\"It's not that I'm not a fan of Mac Allister, I think he's a wonderful player. Curtis Jones is terrific as well. But Mac Allister missing pre-season has affected him. He's taking his time.",
      "\"You can see physically he's not at the same level as he was last season and it's inevitable when you've missed pre-season. It's really tough to get that back.",

      "Wirtz has yet to score or create a goal since signing for Liverpool from Bayer Leverkusen for what, at that point, had the potential to be a British transfer record.",
      "That has led to much debate over the Germany international's performances.",
      "But Murphy, a key member of the Gerard Houllier's treble-winning team in 2001, believes the scrutiny has gone over the top.",
      "\"When I was a midfielder, I used to look at whether I was making chances for others,\" said the ex-England international the Wettbasis.com. \"If you're doing that, you can't control who converts them.",
      "\"The narrative has gone against Wirtz because the numbers which we're obsessed with in this day and age aren't helping him. I don't see a long term issue with it.",
      "\"There is a small adaptation when you play a more creative player as a 10 rather than an athletic one like Szoboszlai. The biggest problem is when you don't have the ball because Szoboszlai is pretty exceptional and unique with his ability to close down and get around the pitch. There's not many like him.",
      "\"Long term we'll benefit from having a more creative force in that role, especially when you're playing low blocks and need moments of magic against them. That's something I think will improve.",
      "\"I've been disappointed with the negativity around Wirtz. I mean when you come for that much money, I get it, but we're seven games in. He's 22 years old, coming to one of the biggest clubs in the world with huge expectations. More expectations on him than probably any of the others.",
      "\"I'm not concerned. I'm a big fan of his and he just needs a big moment. If he has the Szoboszlai moment (against Arsenal), this goes away.",
      "\"I think the Liverpool supporters as a group, will get behind him and support him and we'll see the best of him.\"",

      "Matheus Cunha has made clear that he was very happy at Wolverhampton Wanderers before signing for Manchester United during the summer transfer window. Ruben Amorim's side triggered the player's £62.5million release clause to agree a deal in early June.",
      "The Brazilian starred for Wolves last season, scoring 17 goals across all competitions and assisting another six. However, he has yet to recapture that form in front of goal at Old Trafford, registering zero goal contributions so far since the move.",
      "Cunha did, though, assist Vinicius Junior for the fifth in Brazil's 5-0 friendly win over South Korea during this international break. While away with his national team, the forward has given an interview to Globo Esporte.",
      "Asked whether this summer's move makes fans see the player differently, Cunha said: \"Without a doubt. It makes it easier for them to follow the games, too, right? (laughs) United's games are shown more on Brazilian television.",
      "\"I left the country very young, and being able to watch them more often during the week definitely connects me with them (the fans). United is a club with many Brazilian fans.\"",
      "Cunha showed his true colours to Wolves fans, though, by insisting he did not push for a move away, despite leaving months on from signing a new contract.",
      "He continued: \"I was very happy at Wolves. The moment I arrived there, right after not having made it to the World Cup, the club was what I needed to remind me how great I had become within my possibilities, how caring the club was towards me.",
      "\"Helping in the best way possible was very important; they also helped me, and I was able to reciprocate. Among records and goals, what made me most proud was reciprocating the affection.\"",
      "Speaking about his current situation, Cunha said: \"Being here now in the national team, at United, is, without a doubt, a different level, a different moment as a player\"",
      "\"I try as much as possible to adapt, to learn... It's only been two months, but it feels like I've been here for a long time because of the club's current situation, because I have to get results as quickly as possible, because I'm a signing... All of this helps a lot to find the adaptation faster and feel as good as possible in the national team.\"",

      "Premier League giants Manchester United are anticipated to oppose a new financial 'anchoring' rule, which is due for a vote among the Red Devils and rival top-flight clubs next month. It comes as the Premier League attempts to revamp its existing financial regulations.",
      "Profitability and Sustainability Rules (PSRs), which are currently in effect, allow clubs to record a loss of £105million over a three-year rolling period - with deductions made for expenses such as the women's team and infrastructure. There has, though, been a lot of question marks on the 'fairness' of those rules.",
      "Over the last three seasons, three clubs have been charged with PSR breaches. Everton (twice) and Nottingham Forest were both handed point deductions by the Premier League.",
      "Leicester City were also charged, but were found not guilty - owing to a jurisdictional technicality following their relegation to the Championship in 2023. The Foxes now face another charge, though, following an amendment of the rules - and the wait to see if they are found in breach and hit with a potential punishment goes on.",
      "A key aspect of the proposed new rules is anchoring, which would restrict clubs to five times the amount earned by the league's bottom club from both prize money and broadcast revenue. According to The Times, initial plans were considered in March, when clubs first cast their votes on the matter. It's reported that 16 clubs supported the idea.",
      "However, United, neighbours Manchester City and Aston Villa voted against the proposal while Chelsea in turn abstained. Critics argue that the system would, effectively, act as a salary cap and could negatively impact clubs' ability to remain competitive in Europe - which in turn could potentially harm the Premier League's reputation as one of the world's strongest domestic competitions.",
      "It's expected that there will be another vote on the anchoring rule next month at the forthcoming Premier League shareholders' meeting. The vote will be divided into three sections - squad ratio rules, set to be fixed at 85 per cent, anchoring, and sustainability rules associated with the new independent regulator.",
      "As part of the proposal, the Premier League have also included potential penalties for non-compliance. One such penalty is a minimum six-point deduction plus an additional point for every £6.5m over the limit.",
      "United co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe has already expressed his views on proposed changes.",
      "\"The last thing you want is for the top clubs in the Premier League not to be able to compete with Real Madrid, Barcelona, Bayern Munich, PSG - that's absurd,\" he stated. \"And if it does, it then ceases to be the finest league in the world.\"",

      "Skipper Bruno Fernandes finds himself at the centre of speculation as Manchester United return to action following the international break. That's due to the midfielder's latest display for Portugal, leading to concern in some circles that the 31-year-old is not himself at the moment.",
      "Fernandes has long been United's biggest source of inspiration in key moments, even with the doldrums witnessed under Ruben Amorim. Speaking of Amorim, it appears the manager's insistence on staying true to his system is causing friction in the United dressing room.",
      "As if United didn't have enough problems on their plate right now, there are concerns regarding the current condition of captain Fernandes. At least that's according to reports in the Portuguese media, some of which weren't content with the player during his last international outing.",
      "Cristiano Ronaldo scored twice to put Portugal on the brink of automatic qualification for the 2026 World Cup. That was until Liverpool's Dominik Szoboszlai turned in an injury-time equaliser to at least delay Portugal's procession by a month or so.",
      "But while Ronaldo raked in the plaudits for his brace, questions were raised over Fernandes' seemingly flat-footed display. Renascenca said both he and Manchester City’s Bernardo Silva exhibited signs of \"physical fatigue\" compared to their usual selves.",
      "A Bola clearly wasn't overly impressed with the playmaker, either, as it awarded Fernandes just a six out of 10 rating for his performance. That unsurprisingly ranked among the lower end of Portuguese players on the night.",
      "\"He hit the post once in the second half, but that was perhaps the only time he managed to find space in the central corridor,\" read the assessment. \"For this reason, he often appeared close to the line, especially on the left, but without gaining any influence.\"",
      "If there is any evidence Fernandes is already feeling tired this season, United will hope it's eliminated ahead of Sunday's trip to Anfield. And if the skipper is feeling out of sorts, Amorim's side could be in for a long afternoon against a Liverpool team hoping to end a run of three straight defeats.",
      "A sense of disbelief continues to preside over Old Trafford amid an alleged lack of faith in Amorim's structure. The Daily Mail reported last month that there are players at United still struggling to buy into the manager's 3-4-3 approach, which was introduced after he replaced Erik ten Hag in November 2024.",
      "However, while others in the squad may feel some discontent towards this commander-in-chief for being so stuck in his ways, Matheus Cunha sees it as a challenge. And the £65million summer recruit believes his versatility will be a boon under Amorim.",
      "One can see why given Cunha's best positions as a frontman, supporting striker or de factor No. 10 are all catered for in Amorim's system. And the Brazilian disagreed with those in opposition by suggesting it's up to United's players to adapt to the blueprint, not the other way around.",
      "\"I think that because I play for Manchester [United] and people follow me more on the pitch, they understand better how I play,\" he told Globo during the international break. \"I think it's part of having that weight, which is a privilege.",
      "\"It's a weight that came after the Tokyo Olympics [for Brazil in 2021]. And if it means having that weight and becoming a champion, I think it's worth putting up with a little bit of confusion about where [I] play.",
      "\"I came to the national team with this stereotype of a number 9 shirt. I play my entire base as a midfielder, and when I became a professional, I encountered this world of 4-3-3. It seems like you have to adapt: either play centre-forward, winger, or 'eight'.",
      "\"They eliminated the midfielder position, and you have to adapt. But I see it positively, as it has given me experience, many more positions, and even more so in short-term tournaments with the national team. Having a versatile player is a huge help for any coach.\"",

      "A deal for England Under-21 star Liam Delap to join Manchester United was all but done before a last-minute change of heart, it has been claimed. Delap instead joined Chelsea, with the opportunity to play Champions League football said to be a factor.",
      "United were 90 minutes away from securing Champions League football themselves, only to lose the Europa League final against Tottenham in Bilbao. They have still been able to lure top attacking talent to Old Trafford, but Delap appears to be the first star they missed out on as a result of that European failure.",
      "According to The Mail, United's deal for Delap was '90 percent done'. A £30million release clause came into play when his previous club Ipswich Town got relegated, and Ruben Amorim's side were in the box seat before Chelsea swooped in.",
      "The same outlet reports that Matheus Cunha - another player with a release clause - was United's top target. They got that deal wrapped up early, also adding Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko to their ranks, though a relatively cut-price Delap deal could have had a knock-on effect on the club's wider transfer business.",
      "Delap didn't take long to get off the mark for Chelsea, netting in a Club World Cup group stage victory over Esperance. His Premier League progress has been derailed by injury, though, and he hasn't played since limping off against Fulham in August.",
      "United's new starting striker Sesko has been eased in, despite a relative lack of other options. His first three league outings all came from the bench, and it wasn't until appearance number six that the Slovenia star scored his first goal for his new employers.",
      "Sesko followed his close-range effort at Brentford with a second United goal in the win against Sunderland before the international break. That victory lifted Amorim's team back up into the top half, but pressure remains ahead of Sunday's trip to Liverpool.",
      "\"Of course, he was anxious for his first goal,\" Amorim said of Sesko before the Sunderland game. \"The thing I like most in Ben is, even when things are hard for him with the ball, he is working hard in every minute of the game. That is the most important thing in the moment.\"",
      "While United's match away to Liverpool will provide a big test, Chelsea have what looks on paper like a more inviting game when they return from the international break. Enzo Maresca's team are off to the City Ground to face Nottingham Forest, who sit a point outside the relegation places and haven't won since the opening weekend of the season.",
      "The game is set to come too soon for Delap to feature, though. The striker remains out of action with the hamstring injury he sustained against Fulham, and isn't expected back until November or perhaps December.",

The Red Devils are looking to build a brand-new £2billion stadium capable of holding around 100,000 people, where their current, leaky home is.",
      "United co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe first laid out these ambitions by describing the club's vision as the 'Wembley of the North'. A 100,000-seater stadium would see United own the biggest stadium in the country, with current leader Wembley Stadium holding 90,000 spectators.",
      "However, their ambitions have recently been complicated by an ongoing issue with a vital part of land close to the Stretford End. United do not own this specific space, which belongs to Freightliner.",
      "Reports from the Daily Mail claim that the 13-time Premier League winners have offered £50m to purchase the land. Unfortunately for the Reds, it's also said Freightliner are looking for £400m.",
      "United believe the government could intervene to set a fair price by making a compulsory purchase order. But this may not be necessary, as the same report states that United officials have engaged in \"constructive\" talks with Freightliner and are confident a deal is only a matter of months away.",
      "If United can purchase the land, they can move forward in their ambitions for the new Old Trafford. In March, futuristic designs of a bigger Old Trafford created by Lord Norman Foster, featuring an enormous canopy, were presented.",
      "Previous reports understand the stadium costs are in the ballpark of around £2bn. The land owned by Freightliner is believed to be part of the new stadium footprint, which is made up of 17,000 homes.",
      "It already has the support of the mayor of Manchester, Andy Burnham, who suggested he may sign off on compulsory purchase orders. In August, after telling BBC Radio Manchester an order could be signed \"if needed,\" he said: \"The Greater Manchester Combined Authority has approved the establishment of a mayoral development corporation (MDC) to oversee a masterplan of the area to facilitate some of the land assembly.",

      "Reports from the Athletic have also stated United were contemplating the introduction of 'Personal Seat Licences' which could result in fans having to pay up to £4,000 for the right to buy a season ticket at the new venue. This scheme, which is widespread at US sporting events, is also believed to be optional and would mainly concern seats in the premium areas of the stadium.",

      "Last summer, United were heavily linked with Brighton's Baleba, but a deal didn't happen after the lion's share of their budget was splashed on bolstering the attack. Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko were all added to the squad.",
      "Brighton chairman Tony Bloom has since confirmed United's interest in Baleba. However, talks with the Premier League side never advanced beyond initial contact last summer, as the Seagulls were believed to be holding out for a hefty £115million fee – a figure they compared to Chelsea's deal for Moises Caicedo – if they were to let their star man go at that stage.",
      "Despite that steep price tag, rumours continue to swirl linking Baleba with a move to Old Trafford in both the January and next summer's transfer windows, However, United have also been keeping tabs on other midfield talents, including Palace man Wharton.",
      "Reports now suggest that the England international has leapfrogged Baleba in United's transfer pecking order. According to the i paper, Amorim is a big fan of Wharton, particularly due to knack for kick-starting attacks with forward passes.",
      "Baleba's inconsistent start to the season with Brighton has also reportedly raised eyebrows at Old Trafford. While Brighton are expected to demand a hefty sum of over £100million, for Baleba, it's believed that Wharton could be secured for a lesser amount, although the exact figure Palace would demand remains uncertain.",

      "Crystal Palace may have a fight on their hands if they want to keep hold of midfielder Adam Wharton in 2026. And Manchester United icon Wes Brown has backed his old club to move for the Eagles talisman ahead of Carlos Baleba.",
      "The Red Devils were linked with Brighton's box-to-box star in the summer but pulled out after learning he would cost in excess of £100million. Some fans may want to see Ruben Amorim's side go back in for the Cameroon international next year, but treble-winner Brown believes Wharton is the better signing.",
      "The 21-year-old has taken the Premier League by storm since moving to Selhurst Park from Blackburn in February 2024. When asked whom he'd like to see United sign out of Wharton or Baleba in 2026, there was no doubt who was the superior candidate.",
      "\"I’d have to go for Adam Wharton. I love him, and I think it’s always good if you can add an English player to the squad,\" he told 10Bet Casino. \"He’s strong, he’s talented, he’s technically good, and he knows his job on the pitch. He knows the Premier League and I’d have no problem if United bring him in.",
      "\"I think he could maybe be the right replacement for Casemiro. He’s not going to be there for years to come, and it might be time for that position to be freshened up. The midfield is all about combinations and partnerships, so if Wharton comes in he’d have to be able to link up with the players we’ve already got.",
      "\"We saw for England when it was Scholes, Lampard and Gerrard, you can’t just shove your best players into a team and hope it works. It’s not as simple as that. You need a manager to make sure the combinations are right, and for Wharton, I think he would be the right man for that position in midfield.\"",
      "It's possible two slots are set to open up in United's midfield next year as Casemiro's contract runs down to its expiry date. Kobbie Mainoo is also being slated for a departure after struggling to work his way into the Amorim's plans.",
      "Wharton's stock has gone nowhere but up since he moved to south London last year. Not only has the player earned his way into Thomas Tuchel's England reckoning, but he also played a huge role in getting Palace to Europe and securing the club's first major title following last year's FA Cup triumph.",
      "Not only that, but it appears he would be significantly cheaper than Baleba if the £60m figure attached to his name proves accurate.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Emmanuel Petit has launched a scathing attack on Manchester United boss Ruben Amorim, accusing him of \"talking absolute nonsense\". The ex-Arsenal and Chelsea star claimed Amorim has been making 'excuses' with his United side coming in for intense criticism this season.",
      "Amorim had previously claimed that his players were being influenced by high-profile pundits' criticism of his system ahead of their match against Sunderland. His side's victory over the newly promoted side has quietened the noise around his future and United's struggles, but that hasn't stopped the Portuguese boss from absorbing criticism for the way he's handled the situation.",
      "After Gary Neville dismissed Amorim's remark, Petit then delivered his own damning verdict and slammed the former Sporting CP boss.",
      "Speaking to Boylesports, he said: \"That's the first time I've heard a manager use that as an excuse for the failure of his players. Don't be ridiculous. Ruben Amorim is talking absolute nonsense. Your players know what you're saying is absolute nonsense, too.\"",
      "He added: \"How can you say that when you manage for Manchester United? If you are not able to deal with critics when you manage or play for big clubs and are receiving so much money, then change clubs. Don't work with top clubs.",
      "\"I read that and thought, 'Did he seriously say that?' I've been a player for top clubs with huge expectations. When I was on the pitch, I never tried to find excuses",
      "\"You just take your own responsibility, be a man. I know I've been very upset with critics, some of what they said was unfair most of the time, but you have to deal with it.",
      "\"The beauty of football is that you have your own destiny in your hands, which means you can be on the floor after one game and then be the hero of the next. You can change that situation. You have the power to change it, so just do it.",
      "\"Stop focusing on what people are saying in videos from players on social media. Every single player and the manager, all together, should try to change the situation, the environment.",
      "\"There are so many people at Manchester United who are missing the character and personality to change it. Honestly, guys, if you can't do that, just be honest with yourself in the mirror. Say, 'I'm not able to do that because I'm scared.' This is it. So be honest and change.\"",
      "Amorim had faced mounting pressure before United secured a vital 2-0 win over Sunderland ahead of the two-week international break. Mason Mount and Benjamin Sesko were on target for the Red Devils as they climbed to tenth in the Premier League standings and eased the heat on Amorim.",
      "Following the match, Amorim appeared thrilled and commended his squad for battling through to victory despite \"not playing well during all the game\".",
      "He said: \"Yeah, and a clean sheet is really important. We didn't play well during all the game, but we had our moments. But if you look at the performance, it was a team.",
      "\"Focus, defending well, trying to kill the game in the second half. So, I'm pleased with that, and now it's [time] to move forward to the next one.\" United are straight back into the thick of it and face an out-of-form Liverpool side at Anfield on Sunday in their first game back from the international break.",

      "Dion Dublin has warned Liverpool that his Manchester United are \"due\" a big win that can change their season before the two rivals clash at Anfield on Sunday.",
      "“Liverpool watch out - it is going to be a close one,” said the BBC analyst. But the ex-England striker is still backing Arnie Slot’s side to defend their Premier League title in a tight race this season.",
      "Liverpool host the Northwest derby after a run of three consecutive defeats before the international break. And despite co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe’s public backing for Ruben Amorim, Manchester United remain in 10th place without an away win this season as the Portuguese coach approaches his first anniversary in the job next month.",
      "But since the 7-0 Anfield humiliation under Erik ten Hag in March 2023, the Old Trafford club have drawn their last two away games at Liverpool.",
      "And former Manchester United forward Dublin said: “This is one of one of two or three games in the season which just level out. We know that Liverpool have been better than Manchester United for many, many years. But this is a rivalry, it is tribalism - it could go either way. As an ex-Man United player, I want them to win the game.",
      "“They are due to have a very potent, winning game. Liverpool watch out - it is going to be a close one. Liverpool have lost their last three games - this is where they can be at their most dangerous because they may not be in their stride but they have got so many amazing, world-class players. If they turn it on, nobody can live with them. I am hoping they don’t turn it on. But if they do, it is going to be some game.”",
      "Manchester United finished 15th last season and have already suffered a humiliating defeat to Grimsby in the Carabao Cup in this campaign.",
      "“Man United have to be in the top four - that is it,” added Dublin. “And that is a low estimate for Manchester United football club. They should be winning the Premier League, they should be getting into the Champions League every single year. Where they are right now, European football would be a good season.",
      "“If Man United win on Sunday, they will be in a better place mentally. I think there will be more harmony in the dressing room. Beating Liverpool for Man United has got to be the stepping stone where they need to go: ‘We have beaten one of the best teams in the world, never mind the Premier League. This is when we have to start turning it on’.”",
      "The title race is open with Liverpool, who started their Premier League defence with five consecutive wins, getting overtaken at the top by Arsenal before the break. The top two were the biggest spenders over the summer but Dublin does not see a two-horse race.",
      "“It is a tough one to call,” added the Homes Under The Hammer presenter. “Hard to look past Liverpool, Arsenal have been outstanding yet again. Are they going to get over the line this time after going so close? Man City are now going to be a little bit angry because they have been out of the picture. They want to get silverware. Chelsea as well. So many sides. I think if Liverpool start to get in their stride, they could be hard to catch.”",

      "Manchester United legend Paul Scholes has questioned Manchester United's summer transfer tactics. The former midfielder is unconvinced by the club's approach to signing Benjamin Sesko, while allowing Rasmus Hojlund to leave.",
      "Scholes reckons United have made a mistake by thrusting Sesko into the same position Hojlund found himself in when he arrived at Old Trafford, where he was expected to lead from the front as United's main striker. The Denmark forward signed for the Red Devils for £72million but struggled to establish himself as a reliable goalscorer before making the move to Napoli.",
      "Hojlund bagged 26 goals in 95 appearances for United but only 14 in the Premier League. That saw club chiefs move to replenish the forward line by signing Sesko, Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha for £200m. But Scholes believes United are repeating a mistake of the past, with 50-year-old claiming they have put the 22-year-old Sesko under the exact same pressure as Hojlund.",
      "\"You look at Rasmus Hojlund, 22-year-old kid, came when he was 20 years of age,' Scholes said on The Good, The Bad and The Football podcast. \"One centre-forward for Manchester United and everything was on him, the pressure was on him and he couldn't handle it. He should be coming in and out of the team. There should be three or four centre-forwards there.",
      "\"This summer, what do they do? They let him go and they buy another one, very similar, exactly the same! 22 years of age.",
      "\"He's started ok, he looks like he's getting better. But where's the common sense in that?\"",
      "Sesko has two goals in his last two Premier League matches but Hojlund has found things easier away from Old Trafford. With competition from Lorenzo Lucca, the striker has been on fire for Napoli and scored four goals in six matches.",
      "Scholes highlighted the difference at United now, compared to the past when Ole Gunnar Solksjaer arrived. The Norwegian finished as the top goalscorer amid competition from Eric Cantona and Andy Cole, while Teddy Sheringham arrived at the end of the season.",
      "\"It's like Ole coming over to us when he was 22 and we had no other centre-forward and he was the one playing every week,\" Scholes said. \"You'd kill him!\"",
      "Nicky Butt agreed with his team-mate. \"That's us as well, when we played,\" he said. \"They all talk about our group coming through. But we didn't play every game, we weren't in every week with all the pressure on our shoulders.",
      "\"You look to your left and you'd have Roy Keane, you look to your right and you'd have Bryan Robson or Brian McClair.",
      "\"You're surrounded by unbelievable players and you think, it's easy for me because I can play 6 out of 10 today and we're still going to win because we've got all these players around us. They don't have that now. I do feel sorry for the players.\"",

      "However, the rail yard surrounding Old Trafford is owned by Freightliner. The land is crucial to plans for a 100,000-seater stadium and Andy Burnham, the Mayor of Greater Manchester, previously suggested compulsory purchase powers could be used to acquire the space if a deal could not be agreed.",
      "In the summer, reports claimed Freightliner valued the land at £350million, although Burnham played down that figure, saying: “I think everyone should file that one away.\"",
      "United and Freightliner have continued discussions and are making progress to reach an agreement, according to the latest fans' forum minutes, which were published on Wednesday.",

      "\"We’ve been engaged in constructive discussions with neighbouring landholders and are optimistic about reaching mutually agreeable terms in the coming months.\"",

      "The 2-2 with Liverpool last season came a few weeks after United beat Manchester City at the Etihad while United also knocked Arsenal out of the FA Cup at the Emirates last winter.",
      "Those displays against the teams that took the top three places in the Premier League belied United's ultimate 15th place finishing position as the Reds endured their worst domestic campaign since they were relegated in 1974. That was Fernandes' main gripe, the absence of consistency that saw United take one step forward and two steps back.",
      "\"I’m pretty upset,\" lambasted Fernandes moments after the full time whistle at Liverpool in January. \"Because, if we can show this today against Liverpool at Anfield, who are first in the league and who have been probably the outstanding team in the league this season, why can't we do this every week?\"",
      "Nine months on the same concerns remain. Amorim's men have won three and lost three of their opening seven league games and been dumped out of the Carabao Cup by League Two side Grimsby Town.",
      "There were positives in defeat to Arsenal on the opening day and wins over Chelsea and Sunderland hinted at the potential in this United side. But demoralising defeats to Brentford and Manchester City undermine any signs of progress.",

      "Manchester United's pursuit of Brighton and Hove Albion's Carlos Baleba is far from done, despite how much the Reds would need to pay to sign the Cameroon international.",
      "Baleba emerged as a late transfer target for United in the summer transfer window after they concluded the deal to bring Benjamin Sesko to Old Trafford. MEN Sport reported at the time that the Reds were willing to wait until next summer to move for the 21-year-old.",
      "\"I don’t think Baleba was a saga,\" Bloom has told The Argus this week. \"There was interest from Manchester United, and we said that he wasn't available this summer and they went away.",
      "\"So we've had many bigger sagas in the past. But Carlos Baleba, his improvement has been immense. Massively important player to this football club, and just delighted that he's with us for this season.\"",
      "Bloom's comments suggest that United will need to come back in the summer if they wish to sign Baleba. That will not be considered a bad thing for the Reds considering their reluctance to splash such huge amounts of money in January.",
      "It also seems, reading between the lines, that Brighton are bracing themselves to potentially lose Baleba next summer. Whether that is to United or someone else, remains to be seen.",
      "It does not seem to be a deal breaker for Baleba if United are without Champions League football next season. Remember, we understand that the midfielder was open to joining in August when he knew he would not be playing with Europe's elite.",
      "However, the riches that come with playing in the Champions League would certainly help fund a move for Baleba and strengthen other positions. Otherwise, United may have to turn towards selling stars to fund their business.",
      "To sign Baleba without the Champions League riches, United would probably be looking at two players in particular who could be sold. First is Bruno Fernandes who has been wanted by Saudi Pro League clubs for some time.",
      "He could bring in a profit should the Middle East teams return to the table with offers around £100m. Fernandes has been adamant regarding his desire to stay at United for as long as the club want him but time is running out for the Reds to cash in for such big money on their captain, so their hand could be forced.",
      "The other option would be to sell Kobbie Mainoo. As a product of the United academy, Mainoo represents 'pure profit' for the Reds which makes him a tempting player to sell.",
      "Ruben Amorim's decision to overlook Mainoo regularly could force the decision to sell him and the midfielder could be open to that, considering how well others have done since.",
      "MEN Sport reported this week that United would be open to extending Casemiro's stay at the club, but only if he was to agree to a lower wage. Were he to do that, the Reds may choose to hold fire on an approach for Baleba.",
      "If the Cameroonian has his heart set on United, the club may choose to wait and see if they can get him cheaper in 2027 when only a year is remaining on his deal. It is a risky strategy but it may only be used if Amorim feels that money would be better being spent elsewhere or on different targets - like Adam Wharton, for instance.",

      "In an international break where talk of a takeover resurfaced and speculation over the manager's future rumbled on, Manchester United and Ruben Amorim will be grateful to get back on the pitch this weekend.",
      "The Reds visit defending champions Liverpool on Sunday aiming to maintain the momentum provided by the victory over Sunderland last time out.",
      "A victory at Anfield would be something of a statement performance and restore hopes that United could close the gap to the top four in their bid to bring Champions League football back to Old Trafford.",
      "Amorim's men are devoid of European football all together this term having lost the Europa League final to Tottenham in May.,",
      "But amid transfer talk linking the Reds with the likes of Adam Wharton and Carlos Balbea, and rumours around a potential Saudi Arabia takeover, dining at Europe's top table has argubaly never been more important.",
      "United need Champions League football to improve and succeed on and off the pitch. The absence sets clubs like United back around £85million as a starting position given the income guaranteed from matchday, broadcasting and prize money revenues. The figure would be swelled further by progress into the knockout rounds.",
      "In the absence of European nights, United look set to play to travel abroad mid-season for a friendly fixture having visited Asia immediately after the 2024-25 campaign to play two friendlies. Those fixtures earned the Reds around £8million, while a summer tour to America will have swelled coffers further.",
      "And while it is not certain whether United want to play a Saudi Pro-League club or a similarly placed European giant, such as AC Milan, head coach Ruben Amorim said last week: \"We have to do it.",
      "\"We knew that when we missed Europe, we had to compensate [for] a lot of things, including our fans and the budget. So we are putting [it] all together to do that.\"",
      "In a competitive global environment United have to try and maximise revenue. Historical success means they have a huge fanbase across the world but recent on-pitch struggles mean plenty of other clubs are making significant progress in reaching a global audience.",
      "United are enduring a season without European football, another dagger to their financial heart, with the absence of Champions League football conservatively put at £85million while the Reds did not even have the fallback of playing in the Europa League.",
      "A second successive campaign with no continental football would be a catastrophic blow to United's ambitions on and off the itch. It would hinder attempts to bring in elite players to help reshape Amorim's squad, while it would once again leave the Reds counting the cost financially.",
      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe has already introduced swathes of cost-cutting measures, many controversial, since he took on partial ownership and if United cannot find a way into the Premier League's top four there will be once again be questions asked by Ratcliffe.",
      "He gave Amorim a public vote of confidence last week but a second successive campaign outside of Europe's elite, and outside of the revenue streams the competition brings, will not sit well in the United boardroom.",
      "The Reds have work to do on the pitch to ensure they can compete with the leading lights of the Premier League. This weekend's clash with Liverpool at Anfield is an acid test. Arne Slot's side are defending champions and twice broke the British transfer record in the summer as they added leading talent to their squad from a position of strength.",
      "Both sides are locked on 20 English top-flight titles, United haven't won one for more than a decade and won't win it this season.",

      "Hello and welcome to live coverage of all the latest Manchester United news on Thursday, October 15.",
      "The Reds' season is currently on hold due to the second international break of the season, and talk has quietened around Ruben Amorim's suitability for the top job at Old Trafford for now after a 2-0 defeat of Sunderland last time out.",
      "Amorim's future may well have been knocked down the news agenda, but United were plunged into further uncertainty last week when the mega-rich Saudi Arabian government official Turki Al-Sheikh made huge claims about a takeover of the club on social media.",
      "That sparked speculation online about what this could mean for the Reds' immediate future, with further claims that the supposed investors were based in the United Arab Emirates and had approached United legends about backing their bid.",
      "We will have all the latest on that, top transfer headlines and injury news as the Reds' return to action with a clash against Liverpool this weekend edges closer...",
      "According to TEAMtalk, United want to sign Harry Kane. The report claims that the Reds view the Bayern Munich striker as a key player for their rebuild, but any chance of securing his signature coyld hinge on their results in the Premier League.",
      "It's said that Tottenham Hotspur are willing to pay the release clause in Kane's contract, which is thought to be worth about £52m, and pay the wages required to bring him back to north London.",
      "TEAMtalk reckon that the England captain is keen on a return to the English top-flight, with Alan Shearer's goal tally in his sights.",
      "In an interview with the Metro, Danny Simpson urged United to sign Ivan Toney in the January transfer window. The former Leicester CIty defender said: \"He’s obviously got the temperament and he knows the league.",
      "\"I actually think as well, because he’s been out in Saudi Arabia, he would actually now come back to maybe play a different role where you are a rotation option. You’re going to get a lot of games, but you might start, you might come off the bench.",
      "\"So I think that’s something, if I were him, you can’t turn that down. Coming to the club like Man United and playing a different kind of role, because you’ve been in Saudi Arabia – that might give him a chance to get with England in the summer, because we’re still short of various strikers...\"",
      "Speaking to BetMGM, as quoted by the Daily Mail, Phil Jones addressed the question marks over Ruben Amorim's future. The former United defender said: \"Do I want to see any manager or coach losing their job?",
      "\"No, especially with the route I want go down now. You need time to get your squad together. I like the fact Sir Jim Ratcliffe has come out and backed him, as you would expect. But it’s a results business.",
      "\"If you don’t get results, I don’t care what length of contract you’re on – 10 years, two years, five years – there will be questions and you will be looked at.\"",
      "Jones added: \"Sunderland (a 2-0 win before the international break) was probably the most complete performance I’ve seen from United this season in every department.",
      "\"But then you play Liverpool, your fierce rivals (on Sunday). If you don’t win there, you’ve got Brighton coming up and that’s not an easy game the way they’re playing at the minute...\"",
      "Peter Schmeichel still can't wrap his head around why United sold Scott McTominay to Napoli last year. Speaking on the Sacked in the Morning podcast, the former Reds goalkeeper said: \"This is a Scottish podcast, the best example is Scott McTominay.",
      "\"He is so much Manchester United. A manager comes in, he knows he’s got anything. United are probably two years and a bit to prove himself.",
      "\"And then you look at him, he’s not that kind of player who’s going to score or create that goal. They don’t trust him to be the one they’re building the team around.",
      "\"They want the good, neat players, and he’s just been the victim of that time and time again. I just don’t get what he’s doing at Napoli. They are Manchester United players.",
      "\"You will get no one with more enthusiasm for Manchester United than Rasmus Hojlund. He was writing about being a Manchester United player when he was 10 years old.\"",
      "According to journalist Graeme Bailey, United are considering a move for James Garner at the end of the season. The Everton midfielder, who swapped Old Trafford for Goodison Park in the summer of 2022, has caught the eye in the early stages of the season.",
      "Garner has recently entered the final year of his contract at the Hill Dickinson Stadium, making him available on a free transfer un the summer. The 24-year-old has been undroppable for David Moyes, starting in each of Everton's nine games across all competitions this term.",
      "Speaking to Globo during the international break, Matheus Cunha lifted the lid on his difficult start to the season. The United forward, who signed from Wolves in the summer, said: \"I think that because I play for Manchester [United] and people follow me more on the pitch, they understand better how I play.",
      "\"I think it's part of having that weight, which is a privilege. It's a weight that came after the Tokyo Olympics [for Brazil in 2021]. And if it means having that weight and becoming a champion, I think it's worth putting up with a little bit of confusion about where [I] play.",
      "\"I came to the national team with this stereotype of a number 9 shirt. I play my entire base as a midfielder, and when I became a professional, I encountered this world of 4-3-3. It seems like you have to adapt: either play centre-forward, winger, or 'eight'.",
      "\"They eliminated the midfielder position, and you have to adapt. But I see it positively, as it has given me experience, many more positions, and even more so in short-term tournaments with the national team. Having a versatile player is a huge help for any coach.\"",
      "In the aftermath of United's pulsating draw with Liverpool in January, Bruno Fernandes wasn't afraid to air out his frustrations. Speaking to reporters, the Reds skipper said: \"I’m pretty upset.",
      "\"Because, if we can show this today against Liverpool at Anfield, who are first in the league and who have been probably the outstanding team in the league this season, why can't we do this every week?\"",
      "Nine months on the same concerns remain. Ruben Amorim's side have only won three of their opening seven league games, and they were dumped out of the Carabao Cup by Grimsby Town.",
      "On Sunday afternoon, the Reds will lock horns with Liverpool at Anfield. The reigning Premier League champions may fancy their chances, but United have shown signs of promise recently...",
      "Crystal Palace are reportedly keeping tabs on the future of Borussia Dortmund midfielder Jobe Bellingham. The younger brother of Real Madrid and England international Jude joined the Bundesliga heavyweights from Sunderland this summer for around £31m.",
      "Unfortunately for the 20-year-old he is yet to register a goal contribution or complete a full 90 minutes of football for the club. German outlet Bild recently claimed Ruben Amorim's side are monitoring his situation.",
      "But they are not the only ones as Crystal Palace are interested in his services, according to GiveMeSport. Dortmund manager Niko Kovac is far from giving up on him, recently highlighting the England U21 international as a player with a \"huge upside.\"",
      "Dion Dublin believes Manchester United may just beat Liverpool at Anfield this weekend. He insisted the Red Devils are due a major victory which can push Ruben Amorim's campaign forward, despite the recent 2-1 home victory over Chelsea.",
      "\"We know that Liverpool have been better than Manchester United for many, many years. But this is a rivalry, it is tribalism - it could go either way.",
      "\"As an ex-Man United player, I want them to win the game. They are due to have a very potent, winning game. Liverpool watch out - it is going to be a close one.",
      "\"Liverpool have lost their last three games - this is where they can be at their most dangerous because they may not be in their stride but they have got so many amazing, world-class players. If they turn it on, nobody can live with them. I am hoping they don't turn it on. But if they do, it is going to be some game.\"",
      "Ex-Manchester United defender Wes Brown believes the return of Lisandro Martinez will be like a new signing to Ruben Amorim. The left-footed, central-defender has been out injured since February after suffering an ACL in the loss to Crystal Palace.",
      "The Argentine was recently training on the grass, with other reports suggesting he could soon be training with the first team very soon. While it will be a long time until he is starting for United again, Brown believes Martinez's return cannot come soon enough.",
      "He told the Metro: \"Luke Shaw has done well on the left of the three, but even with that, I think a club always needs competition for places. When Lisandro Martinez is fit, he’s a rock for the team.",
      "\"He was excellent for a couple of seasons, but he hasn’t played a lot of games recently. He’d need to learn to play alongside Yoro and De Ligt, but if he comes back soon, it’ll be like a brilliant new signing for the manager.",
      "\"Amorim likes to have a left-footer on the left of that back three, and he’s ideal for it. He’s still got a big future at the club, and when he gets back into the side I hope he slots in seamlessly. It’ll be a huge boost for the club and the manager.\"",
      "Dion Dublin believes Ruben Amorim has to guide Manchester United into the top four at the absolute minimum. With three wins, one draw and three defeats, United are currently residing in 10th, below newly promoted Sunderland.",
      "Despite spending more than £200million in the summer, the results have not been coming for Amorim. Looking at the season so far, Dublin warned him anything less than finishing in the top four is unacceptable.",
      "\"They should be winning the Premier League, they should be getting into the Champions League every single year. Where they are right now, European football would be a good season.",
      "\"If Man United win on Sunday, they will be in a better place mentally. I think there will be more harmony in the dressing room.",
      "\"Beating Liverpool for Man United has got to be the stepping stone where they need to go, 'We have beaten one of the best teams in the world, never mind the Premier League. This is when we have to start turning it on.'\"",
      "Tomorrow evening, Manchester United's women's team will take on Atletico Madrid in the Red Devils' second UEFA Women’s Champions League fixture. The Red Devils overcame Valeranga 1-0 in their opening fixture with Maya Le Tissier converting a penalty.",
      "Here's how you can watch Marc Skinner's side in action against the Spaniards, who recently lost 6-0 to defending champions Barcelona.",
      "Those who wish to tune in can do so with a subscription for Disney+. MUTV, the United App and the club's official YouTube channel will be hosting a watch along of the match.",
      "Despite the struggles of Manchester United, young defender Leny Yoro has been included in the list of players for the European Golden Boy award. The young Frenchman has been a bright light in an otherwise dark 14 months for the Red Devils.",
      "He has become one of the first names on the team sheet for Ruben Amorim. Below are the other candidates on the list.",
      "Leny Yoro is among the final players for the Golden Boy award pic.twitter.com/2xc3GkjnWe",
      "Former Manchester United defender Paul Parker has claimed that it would cause \"big problems\" if the Reds allow Kobbie Mainoo to leave, amid his lack of regular game time at Old Trafford.",
      "Parker told mybettingsites.co.uk: \"It would cause big problems if they allow Mainoo to go because he's a local boy. But it's not just about that, it's about what he's achieved in a short space of time and he hasn't been given the time and the respect.",
      "\"You've got to understand, when you're younger, losing form can happen quite quickly but it's about getting it back. When you make mistakes, you nurture, you don't stamp down on things, you demand but you demand in a different way. He hasn't been given what a good manager like Sir Alex Ferguson would do with a young player.",
      "\"Maybe they should've let him go out on loan and play. Go overseas and experience that little bit to come back again and start again. Especially in this current scenario where you're not going to use him, let him go and do that.\"",
      "Jaap Stam is adamant that Harry Maguire deserves a new Manchester United contract.",
      "Ex-United defender Stam told Sky Bet: \"Harry Maguire deserves a new contract. I have a lot of respect for him. He went through a difficult period when managers tried to move him on, but he stayed, fought for his place, and became important again.",
      "\"He’s been professional and resilient, but the only question for the club is whether to invest long-term in him at his age or start building for the future with younger players. In terms of attitude and contribution though, he’s earned a new contract.",
      "\"He has a lot of competition in the national team. To go to the World Cup, he needs to play regularly. If he’s not starting every week at United, he might look elsewhere - but moving doesn’t guarantee playing time either. It depends on the club and the situation he goes into.",
      "\"Sometimes it’s better to fight for your place where you are.\"",
      "Manchester United are exploring a shock move to re-sign James Garner from Everton, according to United in Focus. The 24-year-old left the Reds to sign for Everton in a deal worth £9million in 2022.",
      "Garner has gone on to make more than 75 Premier League appearances and become an integral member of David Moyes' side at the Hill Dickinson Stadium.",
      "Former Manchester United defender Wes Brown has backed Kobbie Mainoo to return to his best and believes that he needs to get out there and play regular football again.",
      "Brown told Freebets.com: \"Listen, Kobbie’s a young, very talented lad. Everyone knows that. He’ll be desperate to play, especially after the impact he made last season, but there’s clearly something going on behind the scenes.",
      "\"Maybe the manager wants different things from him, maybe he’s working on parts of his game. Whatever it is, I just hope there’s good communication between them.",
      "\"At his age, he needs football — it’s as simple as that. He’s not going to develop sitting on the bench. Every fan wants to see him play. When you’ve got that kind of ability, you should be on the pitch.\"",
      "Despite signing Benjamin Sesko during the summer transfer window, Manchester United are reported to be keen on landing another striker and are targeting Mateo Retegui, according to Fichajes.",
      "It's claimed that the Reds are prepared to spend up to £52million on the Italy international, who signed for Saudi Pro League side Al Qadsiah from Atalanta in the summer.",
      "During his time at Atalanta, the 26-year-old scored 28 goals and provided nine assists in 49 appearances. He was the top scorer in Serie A during the 2024/25 campaign and won the Capocannoniere.",
      "Former Arsenal and Chelsea midfielder Emmanuel Petit has hit out at Ruben Amorim after the Manchester United head coach claimed that pundits are influencing his players.",
      "Speaking before his side's game against Sunderland, Amorim said he feels his players are susceptible to reading and hearing a lot of the criticism about his system through high-profile pundits.",
      "After Gary Neville rubbished Amorim's remark, Petit has now weighed in with his verdict and said that the Portuguese is \"talking absolute nonsense\" in a brutal assessment.",
      "Speaking to Boyle Sports, Petit said: \"That's the first time I've heard a manager use that as an excuse for the failure of his players. Don't be ridiculous. Ruben Amorim is talking absolute nonsense. Your players know what you're saying is absolute nonsense too.",
      "\"How can you say that when you manage for Manchester United? If you are not able to deal with critics when you manage or play for big clubs and are receiving so much money, then change clubs. Don't work with top clubs.",
      "\"I read that and thought, ‘Did he seriously say that?’ I've been a player for top clubs with huge expectations. When I was on the pitch, I never tried to find excuses.",
      "\"You just take your own responsibility, be a man. I know I've been very upset with critics, some of what they said was unfair most of the time, but you have to deal with it.\"",
      "Fabrizio Romano has reported that Crystal Palace have no plans to negotiate a fee for Adam Wharton ahead of the January transfer window. Speaking on his YouTube channel, the journalist said: \"They want Adam Wharton to stay at the club and to be a really important part of the story.",
      "\"Then 2026 summer transfer window, maybe after the World Cup, we will see if Wharton will be there or not. He has chances. Palace will assess the situation with the player, also based on proposals.\"",
      "Romano added: \"We have many links with Man United. I can confirm that Man United appreciate the player guys, but it's not only Man United. Trust me, it's several clubs appreciating this boy.",
      "\"He's really appreciated. He's considered one of the best talents in his position in England. And so, for sure, there is interest, Man United, and not only, but at the moment, nothing has been decided in terms of bid, numbers.",
      "\"If you see, 30, 40, 50 millions, nothing at this stage. Palace are very focused on this season with the player and the player is very focused on this season with Palace.\"",
      "According to the Daily Mail, Liam Delap almost joined United in the summer transfer window. The report claims that the striker's move to Old Trafford was 90 per cent done before the Chelsea swooped in and secured his signature.",
      "Delap enjoyed a great start to life with the Blues, winning the Club World Cup, before suffering a hamstring injury. After missing out of the Englishman, United forked out £74m to sign Benjamin Sesko from RB Leipzig.",
      "According to United in Focus, United are keeping tabs on Neiser Villarreal. The report claims the 20-year-old striker, who is set to join Cruzeiro on a free transfer in January, has also attracted interest from Anfield.",
      "It's said that United have had scouts at the Under-20 World Cup this autumn, and Villarreal has caught the eye. The Reds will reportedly continue to monitor his developement when he debuts in Brazil next year.",
      "According to Defensa Central, Kobbie Mainoo would be open to joining Real Madrid on loan for the remainder of the season. The 20-year-old midfielder currently faces an uncertain future, having fallen down the pecking order at United.",
      "The report claims that Mainoo remains focused on becoming a key player for Ruben Amorim, but, if he can't get regular game time, he'll look for a 'way out'. Real madrid are reportedly in the market for a new midfielder, and they 'could consider his possible arrival'.",
      "Ben Foster has explained why Ruben Amorim must bring Adam Wharton to Old Trafford. Speaking on his Fozcast podcast, the former United goalkeeper said: \"I think there's always a lot said about Adam Wharton.",
      "\"I always read a lot of stuff saying, 'God, he's so overrated.' I think you need to watch him for the eye test. First and foremost, go to a game and watch him and see what he's capable of.",
      "\"See how he moves around the pitch, how he operates and it's a thing of beauty. It's effortless. He glides around them, but he's got legs as well. That's the bit there that Man United are interested in.",
      "\"They've got nobody in there at the minute who's got those legs, that can get about, has that vision of passing and that calmness and control when he's got the ball.\"",
      "According to German outlet Bild, United are monitoring Jobe Bellingham's situation at Borussia Dortmund. The 20-year-old midfielder left Sunderland to join the German outfit in the summer for £27m, plus £4.2m in add-ons.",
      "The report claims that Crystal Palace are also keen on the Bellingham. The England Under-21 international has struggled to force himself into Niko Kovač’s side, having made just two starts in the Bundesliga so far this season.",
      "This weekend, the Reds will lock horns with Liverpool at Anfield. While the reigning Premier League may fancy their chances, United have recently shown signs of promise...",
      "That's it for today, folks!",
      "Thank you for tuning in with us. We'll be back bright and early tomorrow.",
      "Catch you then!",
      "Casemiro could stay at Manchester United beyond this season - but only if he takes a significant pay cut.",
      "The Brazil international and five-time Champions League winner with Real Madrid is among United's highest earners with a salary of around £300,000-a-week.",
      "The midfielder is out of contract at the end of this season, although United have an option to extend his deal by an additional 12 months.",
      "But United would look to negotiate any extension for the 33-year-old on reduced terms. Casemiro has re-established himself as an automatic pick at United under Ruben Amorim and is set to start Sunday's visit to arch rivals Liverpool when the Premier League returns following the international break.",
      "Read more here.",
      "Keane has spoken about Marcus Rashford before England's match with Latvia this evening. The forward is currently on loan at Barcelona from Man United.",
      "When asked on ITV Sport if the environment at United was not helping Rashford, Keane said: \"Well, it doesn't help, but if you look back at Marcus' time at United towards the end, there were obviously issues going on. He had one or two issues off the field.",
      "\"I think he was late for one or two meetings on a night out in Belfast or whatever, so he was part of the problem with the environment, particularly as one of the most experienced players at United. He should have been setting the standards and showing new people at the club what it's like to be a Man United player, but I think that's been well documented.",
      "\"What we have to look at with Marcus is he's got this sort of chance now with England, and he deserves it. No doubt about his talent. He's obviously fantastic. His stats obviously need to improve if he wants to go to that next level, like Thomas Tuchel just said there, in terms of goals and assists, but he has the talent.",
      "\"But the other bit that I think would have frustrated fans, not just maybe England more United, was his body language or not running back or not pressing properly. They're the stuff he has to tidy up, and if he does that, then there's no reason why he can't still become a world-class player.\""

      "Bruno Fernandes has carried Manchester United on his back for quite some time. Longer than he will care to remember.",
      "It's almost a full year since Ruben Amorim pitched up at Old Trafford to replace Erik ten Hag. And since his compatriot's arrival, no one has made more appearances than the United captain. Equally, no one has done more to lift the club during what has been its most dismal 12 months in the Premier League era.",
      "On Sunday, United head to Anfield with Fernandes facing accusations of \"physical fatigue\" after Portugal's failure to beat Hungary on Tuesday night. The Portuguese press were unimpressed with Fernandes - who was booked, to pick up a suspension and was hauled off before Hungary's late equaliser.",
      "Ironically, that late equaliser came from someone he'll face on Sunday: Dominik Szoboszlai.",
      "The two could be in direct combat. Then again, they might not. Both see their respective managers move them around the pitch. But while Szoboszlai looks comfortable with whatever the responsibilities are that Arne Slot asks of him - whether as a No.8 a No.10 or even at right-back - comfortable with his role is something Fernandes just currently isn't.",
      "In Amorim's 3-4-3 formation, Fernandes has been found badly wanting when asked to play in a deeper midfield position. You don't have to be a genius to realise that it doesn't play to his strengths. If the world can see that, then why can't Amorim too?",
      "When United are up against a supposedly weaker side and dominating - which doesn't happen that often, let's be honest, then Fernandes wouldn't be exposed. But it doesn't help them to remain secure.",
      "At Anfield this weekend - where Fernandes played as part of the front three in last season's 2-2 draw - he may well starts as part of the midfield two. To do so would be akin to sending a lamb to the slaughter.",
      "United are heading to Merseyside wanting three points and to build momentum coming out of the international break. They may well take one. Whatever it is, neither will happen if Fernandes is on top of his defence and not trying to make the difference in attack.",
      "He should be leading the attack at Anfield, with Bryan Mbeumo and fit-again Mason Mount, playing to his strengths.",
      "If they don't they'll suffer the consequences.",
      "Amorim is still shoe-horning Fernandes into his system'. It needs to stop, or a thumping at Anfield is a possibility.",

      "The youngster has one goal and one assist in five games at Premier League 2 level for United having impressed coming through the age-group sides.",
      "His form at Under-18 level prompted interest from Canada in the forward and Jesse Marsch called the teenager into a senior training camp during the summer in a bid to convince him to join the co-World Cup hosts.",
      "Marsch is a big fan of the United prospect, telling reporters in Canada in May: \"He's a dynamic player. He's very good around the goal. You can see he's an intelligent player.",
      "\"He's a version of Jonathan David. He's not exactly the same player but he's a striker that can play up on the backline and is also good at coming underneath and connecting plays and being part of the build-up phase.",
      "\"I've had good conversations with Gabe and his family. He has several options to think about in what country he wants to represent.",
      "\"I think it's really important that the family feels the connection to Canada.\"",
      "Biancheri subsequently made his debut for Wales Under-21s in September and has this week scored his first goal for his country in a fine 2-0 win over Austria.",
      "He opened his account in the 25th minute of his first start when he capitalised on a loose back pass from David Heindl to sit the goalkeeper down before rolling the ball into an empty net. Chris Popov snatched a second for the Welsh in the 90th minute.",
      "Biancheri's performance caught the eye in Austria and led to some speculating he could earn a call into Craig Bellamy's senior squad for the November internationals.",
      "Canada will likely still harbour ambitions of the youngster declaring for them while Biancheri is also eligible to represent Italy.",

      "\"At the end the decision will be his. He knows where we are and where he is. He's not ready for first-team football with us at this moment.",

      "Former Manchester United defender Phil Jones is embarking on a journey towards management.",
      "The 33-year-old, who hung up his boots last year, has set his sights on securing a top position in the future but acknowledges he must still prove himself worthy.",
      "Jones is presently pursuing his UEFA Pro Licence and has been involved with United's academy players at Carrington during recent campaigns as he transitions from an injury-riddled playing career.",
      "The former Blackburn talent recognises there's considerable groundwork ahead before landing his inaugural managerial role.",
      "\"I don't think there's a right or wrong way,\" Jones told BetMGM. \"People say to me go and take an Under 18s, some say go and be an assistant somewhere.",
      "\"Do I think I'm ready to become a manager? No. I'm not naive and daft enough to think I'm just going to walk into a job. It doesn't work like that. I have to earn the right with steps and progression.",
      "\"But do I think I could add value into a team now? Yeah. I played under a lot of good managers and with good players, I've taken a lot of things from various parts of the game on and off the pitch. That's the goal. That's where I want to be. Let's see.\"",
      "Jones has been content to develop his skills within United's youth system and didn't wish to rush into securing a senior position elsewhere before he felt prepared. And he reckons he has gained from that approach.",
      "\"I didn't want to just come out of the game and say, 'I'll take that manager's job',\" he said. \"I wanted to go about it the right way. Just because I played at United for 13 years, you can't expect to get the biggest jobs.",
      "\"I was on the grass with the kids coaching, and you come away from a session thinking, 'How can I adapt, how can I change it, how can I make it better?'",
      "\"You start thinking about the game more. I don't just watch a game of football now, you're engrossed in patterns of play and systems and how they set up tactically in and out of possession.\"",
      "Looking back on his former club's management situation, Jones is encouraged by Sir Jim Ratcliffe's support of Ruben Amorim. Nevertheless, the coach reckons it will mean nothing if the Portuguese manager fails to deliver results.",
      "Jones reckons Sunday's clash with Liverpool could prove pivotal in determining the direction of United's campaign. The former Old Trafford favourite would be delighted to see Amorim claim silverware.",
      "\"Do I want to see any manager or coach losing their job? No, especially with the route I want go down now,\" he said. \"You need time to get your squad together. I like the fact Sir Jim Ratcliffe has come out and backed him, as you would expect. But it's a results business. If you don't get results, I don't care what length of contract you're on – 10 years, two years, five years – there will be questions and you will be looked at.",
      "\"Sunderland (a 2-0 win before the international break) was probably the most complete performance I've seen from United this season in every department. But then you play Liverpool, your fierce rivals (on Sunday). If you don't win there, you've got Brighton coming up and that's not an easy game the way they're playing at the minute.",
      "\"If you get a draw against Liverpool and then go and beat Brighton at home, you've gathered a bit of momentum and can they really kick on and use it as a catalyst to do something? How many times have we said that over the last six years? Would I like to see Amorim succeed, do really well in the back end of this season and maybe win a trophy? Of course. I'd love nothing more.\"",

      "\"Everyone did their roles and responsibilities and it was a good performance. I think in the second half it got a bit cagey and there were times where we had to defend. We had to put the body on the line.\"",
      "Some fans have joked Mount is the teacher's pet at Manchester United, but he wasn't picked to start in a must-win game against Sunderland because he gets along with Amorim.",
      "Mount started because of the quality, pressing and energy he brings to the team, and he admitted during his post-match chat that he considers himself the \"catalyst\" for the press.",
      "The 26-year-old vindicated his selection just eight minutes into the game when he finished brilliantly at the Stretford End and he might have done enough to retain his starting role against Liverpool.",
      "Mount started against Sunderland at the expense of Matheus Cunha, who might have to settle for a role off the bench again at Anfield when United make the trip to Merseyside on Sunday.",
      "Cunha hasn't put a foot wrong since joining from Wolves in the summer. The Brazilian is yet to score or assist, but his all-round performances have been strong down the left flank.",
      "He was unfortunate not to get off the mark against Fulham at Craven Cottage (Cunha hit the post and was also denied at point-blank range) and it feels like only a matter of time before he breaks his duck.",
      "However, it feels like Amorim will start Mount on the left side in the No.10 role against Liverpool because his work ethic will be hugely beneficial against the Premier League champions in their own backyard.",
      "Cunha has improved that aspect of his game - Wolves' coaches challenged him to improve when not in possession - but he isn't known for working tirelessly backwards and forwards.",
      "That's not to say Cunha doesn't work hard. He has demonstrated his willingness to work his socks off since signing for United, but Mount may be seen as the better option for Anfield.",
      "United is such a big club that rotating a player for tactical reasons can feel like a story - especially if that player is a relatively new signing and was signed for a multi-million-pound fee.",
      "The truth is Manchester City and Liverpool have dominated the Premier League due to their strength in depth. They regularly rotate players and there is no hysterical reaction when a player is benched.",
      "It won't be a big deal if Cunha is named on the bench again this weekend, it would merely be a selection decision made by Amorim to give United the best chance of leaving Anfield with a positive result.",
      "Liverpool are likely to dominate the ball on Sunday afternoon. United will have to work meticulously out of possession, press efficiently and players will have to win their individual battles.",
      "United last won at Anfield in 2016 when Louis van Gaal was in charge and the bookmakers have made Liverpool heavy favourites to win the fixture, but the contest should be closer than the odds suggest.",

      "Manchester United were on the brink of signing England Under-21s star Liam Delap before a last-minute change of heart saw him join Chelsea instead, it has been claimed. It's been suggested that the prospect of playing Champions League football was a key factor in his decision to join the Blues after suffering relegation with former club Ipswich.",
      "United were tantalisingly close to securing their own Champions League spot, only to lose out in the Europa League final against Tottenham in Bilbao. Despite this setback, they've managed to attract top attacking talent to Old Trafford, but Delap may well be the first big name they've missed out on due to their European disappointment.",
      "The Mail reports that United's deal for Delap was '90% done'. A £30million release clause was triggered when Ipswich were relegated, and Ruben Amorim's side looked set to sign him until Chelsea stepped in.",
      "The same source also claims that Matheus Cunha - another player with a release clause which removed the need for haggling over price - was United's primary target. They secured that deal early on, also bringing Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko into the fold, although missing out on Delap could have had wider implications for the club's transfer strategy.",
      "Delap wasted no time in making his mark at Chelsea, scoring in a Club World Cup group stage win over Esperance. However, an injury has since hampered his Premier League progress, and he hasn't featured since suffering a hamstring injury against Fulham in August.",
      "United's new frontman Sesko has been gradually introduced, despite a shortage of alternative choices. It took until the Slovenian's sixth outing for him to find the net in the Premier League, though three of those appearances came from the bench.",
      "Sesko built upon his close-range strike at Brentford with a second United goal in the triumph over Sunderland in the final match before he and a number of United colleagues went away on international duty. That success propelled Amorim's squad back into the upper half of the table, though the heat remains on before Sunday's journey to Liverpool.",
      "\"Of course, he was anxious for his first goal,\" Amorim said of Sesko between the Brentford and Sunderland clashes. \"The thing I like most in Ben is, even when things are hard for him with the ball, he is working hard in every minute of the game. That is the most important thing in the moment.\"",
      "While United's fixture away to Liverpool will present a significant examination, Chelsea appear to have what seems on paper a more welcoming encounter when they return from the international pause. Enzo Maresca's side are heading to the City Ground to meet Nottingham Forest, who remain a point adrift of the drop zone and haven't secured victory since the campaign's opening weekend.",
      "The match is anticipated to arrive too early for Delap to, however. The forward could return in November following his injury setback, but there's still a chance Chelsea don't risk him until the following month.",

      "Sport Central Audience Writer",
      "Peter Schmeichel has claimed that Manchester United made the wrong decision by signing Benjamin Sesko from RB Leipzig and, in turn, offloading Rasmus Hojlund to Napoli during the summer transfer window.",
      "Sesko, 23, made the £66.26million plus £7.36m in add-ons switch to Old Trafford in August. After a difficult start to life at United, the Slovenia international has found the net in each of his last two appearances.",
      "Meanwhile, Hojlund, 22, joined Napoli on a season-long loan deal back in September. Antonio Conte's side have an obligation to buy the forward should they qualify for the Champions League. Since his move to Naples, Hojlund has scored four times in his first six games, forming a dangerous partnership with Kevin De Bruyne in the process.",
      "Allowing Hojlund to leave and bringing in Sesko, though, is a decision that doesn't make sense to Schmeichel, who has criticised United for making such a move and hit out at the club's creative players for Hojlund's woes.",
      "\"The signing of Benjamin Sesko was a little bit weird to me because we have had Rasmus Hojlund, who has been starved of service for two years,\" Schmeichel told BBC podcast Sacked in the Morning.",
      "\"You only have to see what he's doing at Napoli with Kevin De Bruyne and Scott McTominay to play with - he's scoring goals. I've consistently said this for two-and-a-half years - Rasmus Hojlund will be a 25-goal-a-year striker for Manchester United, but he needs service.",
      "Schmeichel added that there were more pressing concerns at United that needed to be addressed first, such as sorting out their goalkeeper position and defensive midfield area.",
      "\"We let him [Hojlund] go on the stats that he scored very little goals last season and bring Sesko in at the time we bring in Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbuemo, who would give Hojlund first-class service. You have spend £70m-plus on Sesko, when we don't have the No.6 we should have, and there's the goalkeeping position as well.",
      "\"This season alone we've conceded nine goals from goalkeeping errors,\" he added. \"When I played, when Edwin van der Sar played, when David de Gea played, the brief was win 10 points a season, you don't give points away.",
      "\"Why did we bring someone in that we didn't need? Because the head of recruitment comes from RB Leipzig [also Sesko's former club] and he's got to make a mark.\"",
      "For me, Schmeichel is bang on in the fact that United had more pressing issues to sort out first and should have signed a new goalkeeper and a central defensive midfielder before addressing the striker position.",
      "It's clear that United had to fix the goalkeeper department and sign a new elite No.1 with Andre Onana struggling and Altay Bayindir failing to impress. Although the Reds managed to bring in Senne Lammens late in the transfer window, it would have been preferred if a more experienced campaigner was signed earlier in the summer months.",
      "The same applies for a new midfielder, though United didn't even manage to bring a new one in and have opted to stick with Casemiro, Bruno Fernandes, Manuel Ugarte and Kobbie Mainoo as their four options in that position. That is something that could prove to be a major mistake for United, who lack real strength and steel there.",
      "While I agree with Schmeichel in that sense, I do think that he is wrong in the opinion that United should have kept Hojlund and not signed Sesko.",
      "At one point last season, Hojlund went through a 21-game goal drought which lasted more than 22 hours. However you dress that up, it's nowhere near good enough for someone that is playing for United.",
      "Across his United career, Hojlund scored just 26 times in 95 appearances. His Premier League return was particularly poor, hitting 14 goals in 62 outings - averaging almost one every five matches.",
      "Schmeichel has put the blame on United's creative players for Hojlund's shortcomings in a Reds shirt, but I think the finger should be pointed at both parties, including the forward who, at times, looked lost.",
      "There is no surprise that Amorim decided to pick Joshua Zirkzee ahead of Hojlund, before the former Bologna man suffered a season-ending hamstring injury. Zirkzee seemed to suit Amorim's system much better.",
      "Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo may have helped Hojlund to score more, but neither have the creative ability of De Bruyne, who has been able to conjure up several high quality chances for the Dane at Napoli.",
      "Sometimes you need the striker to create opportunities for himself and that is what Sesko has the potential to do and more so, at least, than Hojlund who it felt like needed top class service instead.",
      "I have no doubt that Hojlund is going to score a hatful of goals for Napoli in Serie A, but sometimes the fit isn't right for the player and that is what I think it was for him at United. Therefore, the right decision was made for him to be offloaded out loan and the Reds brought in another centre forward in the shape of Sesko.",

      "JJ Gabriel enjoys video games and comes out of his shell once he gets to know someone.",
      "In many ways he is a normal 14-year-old, but his extraordinary talent is revealed when he steps onto a football pitch. There is certainly nothing normal about what Gabriel can do with a ball at his feet.",
      "That is quite the prediction considering the graduates who have come before Gabriel, who already has more than 200,000 followers on Instagram and a sponsorship deal with Nike.",
      "Academy coaches who have worked with Gabriel have marvelled at the youngster's skillset and have struggled to find weaknesses, despite playing him years above his age group.",
      "Gabriel idolises Neymar and some of his goals are reminiscent of the Brazilian at the peak of his powers. Last weekend in an Under-18 game, Gabriel glided into the penalty area, deceived a Manchester City defender with a shimmy and found the corner. The clip has amassed thousands of views on social media.",
      "Word of Gabriel's talent has already swept around the world. Europe's top clubs have closely followed his development, and the teenager was close to leaving United in the summer.",
      "Talks were advanced with a European giant and an eleventh-hour meeting was held at Carrington in an attempt to keep Gabriel. It's understood Jason Wilcox (director of football) and Omar Berrada (CEO) were present, which shows the high regard in which Gabriel is held.",
      "United reiterated that Gabriel could become the face of the club and it was eventually agreed the teenage sensation would remain in Manchester - the player's final decision was decisive.",
      "There are windows for rivals to poach academy players at 14 and 16. Gabriel has committed his future at United for another two years at least, but interest from Europe's biggest sides will only intensify as he gets older, especially as he holds a European passport through his parents.",
      "United know they have a special talent on their hands and recently introduced Gabriel to Ruben Amorim. During their exchange, Amorim spent time discussing his philosophy and stressed the importance of working hard, even recalling an anecdote about Cristiano Ronaldo as an example.",
      "Amorim played alongside Ronaldo for Portugal's national team. The United boss recounted stories about Ronaldo's work ethic - he was the first to report for training and the last to leave.",
      "Gabriel does not lack a work ethic. He is already living like a dedicated professional athlete with his diet and recovery sessions, and wakes up at 6am most days to make his dream a reality.",
      "In the summer, he trained at a Nike camp in Marbella with Newcastle midfielder Sandro Tonali and former Liverpool striker Danny Ings. When Marcus Rashford joined Aston Villa on loan in January, Gabriel thanked him for taking penalties with him at Carrington before he left.",
      "He also received a \"get well soon\" video from Andre Onana when he was recovering from his shoulder injury last year. Experienced players are shocked when they learn his age.",
      "Gabriel has been offered a box at the new Old Trafford, which is planned to be completed by 2030, and was invited to watch the Premier League opener against Arsenal in the directors' box.",
      "It speaks volumes that brands are already desperate to work with Gabriel, who was subject to interest from Adidas before Nike beat off competition from the German company.",
      "Adidas were in pole position to sign Gabriel before a late effort from Nike to better their offer - how many 14-year-olds could spark a bidding war between sportswear's commercial giants?",
      "United want to temper expectations to help Gabriel focus on football. Former academy director Nick Cox was asked a question about Gabriel during an interview earlier this year and politely steered the conversation in another direction. Those questions will become common for his successor.",
      "Those who know Gabriel are not concerned about keeping him grounded. He has strong family support and a circle of friends, and those closest to him don't let him get ahead of himself. He is just JJ to them.",
      "Gabriel possesses the right mentality to enjoy a successful career. It takes him just minutes to forget about the football after leaving the pitch following an academy game at Carrington.",
      "That is a trait that many top professionals share - the ability to separate what happens on the pitch from their home lives - but Gabriel loves playing football and entertaining with the ball.",
      "Darren Fletcher was appointed as U18 manager in the summer, and a source praised Fletcher's handling of Gabriel this season because he wants him on the ball as much as possible.",
      "Gabriel has been played down the middle and from the left this term, although it doesn't matter which position he plays because the end result is the same: he tears through the opposition and scores.",
      "MUTV subscriptions might begin to sell like hot cakes, just so fans can watch Gabriel play.",
      "The teenager's ball control is exceptional, and his finishing power is remarkable for a player of his age. Gabriel has seven goals in six Under-18 appearances and scored for the Under-17s on Wednesday.",
      "He was even given the nickname 'Kid Messi' after clips of him training and completing skills went viral on social media when he was younger, and Lionel Messi would probably approve of his footwork.",
      "Fans have already started to speculate when Gabriel could make his senior debut, and it already feels likely that he will become United's youngest-ever Premier League player.",
      "Angel Gomes (16 years, 263 days), Shola Shoretire (17 years, 19 days) and Chido Obi (17 years, 79 days) are the youngest to make a debut for United in the Premier League.",
      "Gabriel has the potential to break that record, and he could even topple the Premier League record of Ethan Nwaneri (15 years, 181 days). Max Dowman (15 years, 235 days) is the second youngest.",
      "Mikel Arteta has shown faith in Nwaneri and Dowman at Arsenal, while talented Liverpool youngster Rio Ngumoha recently scored on his senior debut aged 16 years and 361 days.",
      "Dowman and Ngumoha have blown away spectators this season, offering an exciting glimpse into the future of English football, but many believe Gabriel could be the pick of the bunch.",
      "There is a reason why Wilcox and Berrada were involved in the meeting to keep Gabriel in the summer, and why the youngster has been offered a box at the new Old Trafford.",
      "He is a generational prospect - and the best is yet to come from the supremely talented teenager.",

      "First-half goals from Mason Mount and Benjamin Sesko were enough to earn United three points that move them up six places to eighth in the Premier League going into the international break.",
      "Here is how United's players rated this afternoon:",
      "Senne Lammens",
      "An assured United debut from the deadline day signing. Confident coming for the ball and made a fine save from Granit Xhaka and one near the end. Will be hard to dislodge him. 8",
      "Leny Yoro",
      "Disciplined in his defending and deserving of his recall to the starting line-up after being benched for the previous two games . Brings better balance to United's back three. 7",
      "Matthijs de Ligt",
      "Alert to danger throughout and never caught out of position defending his goal. Played a key role in United's second goal, challenging for the flick-on that ultimately led to it. 7",
      "Luke Shaw",
      "Kept his place on the left side of United's back three, but moved inside to a more central position at times after the break, giving United greater control on the ball. 7",
      "Amad",
      "A constant threat down the right side. Tormented Sunderland's defence and unlucky not to score in the first-half when he cut inside and saw a goal-bound effort saved. 7",
      "Casemiro",
      "Back in the starting line-up following his one-match ban, he was disciplined in midfield, although he picked up an obligatory booking late on for a poor challenge. 7",
      "Bruno Fernandes",
      "Another ebullient performance from the United skipper, who was seemingly everywhere, covering so much ground. Had an exquisite chip tipped onto the bar by Robin Roefs. 7",
      "Diogo Dalot",
      "Kept his place following the Brentford debacle and it was from his long throw-in that Sesko was able to plunder United's second goal. Impressive energy levels. 7",
      "Bryan Mbeumo",
      "Provided the assist for Mount's opener and never gave the Sunderland defence any peace with his runs in behind and ability to pick up dangerous positions. 7",
      "Benjamin Sesko",
      "Scored for the second game running with a classic poacher's goal from close-range in the first-half. United exploited his aerial threat throughout to win second balls. 7",
      "Mason Mount",
      "Restored to the starting line-up and justified his selection by setting United on their way to victory with a superbly-taken goal. Standing ovation when taken off. 8",

      "PGMO chief Howard Webb has reportedly admitted to Manchester United that Brentford defender Nathan Collins should have been sent off in their defeat on September 27.",
      "With United trailing 2-1 after an Igor Thiago brace which was pegged back by Benjamin Sesko, the Reds won a penalty after Collins tugged back Bryan Mbeumo inside the penalty area. The spot kick was rightly awarded but the punishment for Collins by referee Craig Pawson was merely a booking.",
      "Had Collins made a genuine attempt to play the ball, a booking would have sufficed in this scenario thanks to the recently introduced 'double jeopardy' rule. However, it seemed clear at the time that Collins did not make a genuine attempt and he was the last man, thus preventing Mbeumo having a goalscoring opportunity.",
      "The decision not to send off Collins would feel even more bitter when Bruno Fernandes missed his penalty and Mathias Jensen scored late to win the game 3-1. According to the Daily Mail, United chiefs Omar Berrada and Jason Wilcox sought clarification on the decision with Webb who admitted the mistake.",
      "It is claimed that United did not want to make a 'public fuss' about the situation and appreciated Webb's rational explanation for why the mistake was made. Of course, had Collins been sent off the context of the game could have been a lot different with United having roughly 20 minutes against ten men to seek an equaliser.",
      "What's more, the defeat caused significant pressure to mount on Ruben Amorim which may not have been the case had the match finished differently. MEN Sport understands that United are not currently considering sacking their Portuguese head coach.",
      "Despite reports stating that Gareth Southgate is among the names that Ineos are considering replacing Amorim with, there are believed to have been no contacts made with other managers regarding the currently filled position at Old Trafford. Fortunately for United, they put the defeat to Brentford behind them on Saturday with a 2-0 victory over Sunderland.",

      "Goalkeeper Senne Lammens began his Manchester United career with a win and a clean sheet, and the Belgian international received plenty of credit from his home country's media. Lammens joined United from Royal Antwerp on transfer deadline day but has needed to wait patiently for his debut while Ruben Amorim continued to keep faith with Altay Bayindir.",
      "The new keeper's opportunity arrived at last on Saturday, with Amorim handing him a start against Sunderland. All went according to plan for the 23-year-old, with goals from Mason Mount and Benjamin Sesko ensuring United got three points and eased the pressure on their head coach.",
      "United's win was a timely one for Amorim, with some suggestions his job could be at risk if his team lost. After the victory, he spoke highly of Lammens while also praising the team as a whole.",
      "\"We didn’t play well all the game, but we had our moments and we defended well,\" Amorim said. \"I think Senne did a great job and gave us confidence. It was a good day, not a perfect day, but to win like this with a clean sheet is important for our team.",
      "\"We need to understand that we need everyone to be ready to play. It's a long season, we have a lot of problems, anything can happen. The important thing is that the teammates helped Lammens a lot to have a very good performance.\"",
      "While Lammens will surely face trickier tests than Sunderland this season, perhaps starting with his next game, he still earned plaudits from the Belgian press.",
      "\"Against Sunderland, the scenario was perfect for Lammens,\" Sporza's verdict began. \"He was barely challenged in the first half and took no risks in possession. It was striking how he constantly connected with his backline and made adjustments.",
      "\"Sober, precise, and controlling. Old Trafford appreciated this and gave Lammens plenty of opportunities at times.\"",
      "The same publication pointed to his sharp save from a long-range Granit Xhaka effort, as well as the let-off he received when Bertrand Traore was booked for diving after it looked for a moment as though Lammens had conceded a penalty.",
      "\"If Ruben Amorim still had any doubts about who would be the first choice goalkeeper, Lammens has more than left his mark today,\" Sporza added.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "Elsewhere in Belgium, HLN highlighted Amorim's praise for Lammens while pointing out the goalkeeper watched much of the first half 'from a distance'. They wrote: \"Just over a month after his arrival and after three matches on the bench, Lammens finally made his debut for Manchester United.",
      "\"The goalkeeper thus became the seventh Belgian to feature for the Red Devils. Marouane Fellaini, Romelu Lukaku, Adnan Januzaj, Ritchie De Laet, Marnick Vermijl, and Largie Ramazani preceded him.",
      "\"Lammens had to prove himself once in the first half. The former Antwerp goalkeeper made a good save on a powerful shot from Xhaka. His play on the ball at his feet and on high balls was also flawless. From a distance, our compatriot saw Manchester United dominate.\"",
      "The report added that his next assignment could be considerably trickier. \"All in all, Lammens can look back with satisfaction on his debut in the Manchester United shirt,\" it read. \"His first clean sheet is a fact. This debut will leave him wanting more. His next assignment? The top-flight match at Anfield against Liverpool on Sunday, October 19th. Lammens will likely be tested more then.\"",
      "Nieuwsblad's Brian Dewulf referenced United fans' response to the impressive debut. \"Just before half-time, Senne Lammens finally got the chance to show his true colours,\" he wrote. \"Granit Xhaka had the first attempt for Sunderland, but Lammens saw the long-range shot come from far out and made a good save. There was applause in Old Trafford.",
      "\"The Belgian goalkeeper remained virtually unemployed in the second half, though it was a bit of a shock after an hour of play. Bruno Fernandes gave his keeper the runaround with a long ball, causing the pair to collide. Sunderland winger Traoré lurked and nearly capitalised, but also went down in the action.",
      "\"Ultimately, Man United were given the foul, allowing Lammens and his teammates to breathe a sigh of relief. He was applauded again in the final seconds for his second save of the evening, but Lammens was never given another opportunity.",
      "\"It was certainly a successful debut for the Belgian goalkeeper. Manchester United secured only their third Premier League victory, and the young Belgian also secured their first clean sheet of the season for the Mancunians.",
      "\"Has the train departed? During the match, the home fans were already singing loudly for the goalkeeper: \"Are you Schmeichel in disguise?\" fans wondered aloud if Lammens wasn't just the former Danish legend of Man U.\"",

Van Nistelrooy started Casemiro in all four of his matches as caretaker manager. Casemiro lingered as Van Nistelrooy spoke, as attached to him as a comfort blanket.",
      "At that time, Casemiro had not started for United in 39 days. He did not get a kick between December 30, the night of the Newcastle United debacle, and January 30. He emerged on 70 minutes in Bucharest with United 2-0 up. The transfer window was still open but the chances of United shifting Casemiro were, like the Trinity test igniting the atmosphere, near zero.",
      "People at United's Carrington training complex noticed Casemiro's personality never wavered during a trying first half of the season. They have always found him to be a warm presence.",
      "His transformation at United in the past two months has been as unexpected as their 3-0 triumph in Bilbao. This is the midfielder who was dropped for last year's FA Cup final and replaced by Toby Collyer with United 2-0 down to Liverpool at half-time eight months ago. Casemiro’s declaration that he was keen to see out his contract in March was framed as more bad news for the club.",
      "Casemiro used his head before Athletic lost theirs in San Mames. Returning to Spain emboldens Casemiro. In San Sebastián and Bilbao, he has reminded Spanish audiences he can still cut it nearly three years on from leaving their shores. United supporters serenaded Casemiro on Thursday night.",
      "The draw with Real Sociedad in mid-March has marked a late turning point in Casemiro's third season in Manchester. With Manuel Ugarte out injured, Ruben Amorim had little choice but to turn to the older defensive midfielder.",
      "Casemiro has since been a fixture in the United starting XI, his importance highlighted by the early withdrawal at Bournemouth last week to preserve him for Bilbao. Ugarte admitted this week he is copying him.",
      "Within a matter of months, Casemiro has gone from unsellable to undroppable. If or when United reach the Europa League final, Casemiro is a shoo-in in midfield. The 3-4-2-1 system Amorim swears by has closed the yawning gaps that developed between the defence and midfield under Ten Hag and Casemiro has the safety net of a third centre back.",
      "United have adjusted Casemiro’s running and pressing triggers. “I think he has improved a lot also,” Amorim opined. “You can see not the way he plays but the way he runs. You can see it, we have the data to show him where he worked really hard.",
      "“He is a very good example. Even Toby sometimes was playing in front of him and [that] it is hard to take for Casemiro. So it is a lesson for all the players in Manchester United.",
      "“No matter what is the past or the last month, everything can change in one moment. Then we understood that he cannot jump all the time pressing high. We need to let him understand and sometimes it is better to put three defenders and let him be the fourth defender and put the wing-backs pressing high. These are all things we are understanding and trying to cope with all the criticisms of the team. But the credit is for Casemiro.”",
      "Amorim has been impressed by how hard Casemiro has worked to meet his demands to regain his place in the team. He noticed that he never complained during those winter weeks warming the bench.",
      "Selflessness is a natural trait of Casemiro's. It was also his undoing this time last year. With United depleted at centre half, he dropped back and was humiliated in the 4-0 drubbing by Crystal Palace.",
      "With Kobbie Mainoo and Christian Eriksen a flimsy shield and Jonny Evans his creaking partner, Casemiro abandoned his position to engage Michael Olise, overcommitted, lost his balance and Olise scored. Six days later, he trundled out of the United third and played Arsenal winger Gabriel Martinelli onside to square for Leandro Trossard’s tap-in. Sofyan Amrabat was ushered back in from the cold and played his way into the FA Cup final XI.",
      "Jamie Carragher urged Casemiro to “leave the football before the football leaves you”. Casemiro had been pencilled in to flank Amorim for pre-match press duties against Athletic and he would be a worthy choice at Carrington next week. He is a positive story again and one of the squad’s figureheads. United view Casemiro as a quiet leader, mind.",
      "The 33-year-old shared Raphael Varane’s view that a “disconnect” had developed between the players and Ten Hag. It is not a coincidence that Casemiro scored two goals in the first game after Ten Hag was finally sacked. He was committed enough to claim the last goal of the Ten Hag era at West Ham.",
      "When Casemiro discussed the possibility of joining United, he wanted to know three things: where he would live, where he would train and where the stadium was. During FaceTime conversations, he requested to see the club’s gymnasium at Carrington.",
      "United sources have been struck by how leaner Casemiro is this season. People in Madrid said Casemiro used to be in the club's Valdebebas gym at 8am and he often has gym sessions before and after training at Carrington.",
      "Casemiro has struck up a close rapport with some of the masseurs and his English is now a very good level of conversational. He understood our questions in the mixed zone two years ago, when his handshake grip was as tight as a vice. Casemiro's wife, Anna, and children Sara and Caio, are happy in Manchester amid the prospect of a fourth year in England's north west.",
      "Staff at Carrington regard Casemiro as one of the most respectful players they have encountered and that he is strident in protecting the club's image. Sir Jim Ratcliffe dubbed Casemiro as \"overpaid\" and \"not good enough\" in March. Three days later, Casemiro trumped his first-leg performance against Sociedad in the 4-1 win at Old Trafford.",
      "His steep decline over 18 months - dropped for Amrabat, substituted for Collyer, omitted from the Brazil squad - makes Casemiro’s revival so singular. If United win the Europa League it would be churlish to argue someone who has won three trophies in three seasons has been an unsuccessful signing.",
      "Casemiro drove United to a successful 2022-23 season. Without him, they would not have qualified for the Champions League. Ten Hag dubbed him the “cement between the stones”, essentially the glue in the team. Casemiro was central to the Latino rebranding of the United defence that kept the most clean sheets in the Premier League.",
      "Casemiro has returned to that level of influence he wielded in his first season. In Europe, at least. The concern if United do not triumph in Bilbao again this month is Casemiro could be redundant in a campaign devoid of Champions League midweeks. His recent domestic form has been inoffensive but not stellar and United need a young and dynamic new central midfielder in the summer.",
      "The senior figures made the difference in Bilbao, though. Casemiro and Bruno Fernandes, two 30-something Portuguese speakers, are naturally close.",
      "“We've got a lot of senior players who need to step up in their moments,” Harry Maguire explained. “I think Case was brilliant tonight. Bruno as well. So we have senior players who need to handle these moments really well.”",
      "Van Nistelrooy, a champion of Casemiro’s, merits credit for that.",

      "Manchester United legend Gary Pallister has given his backing to under fire manager Ruben Amorim but admitted that “it’s not working” and change may have to come if they lose to Liverpool this weekend.",
      "Almost a year on from his arrival at Old Trafford, the future of Amorim at United looks increasingly uncertain with a 15th-place finish last season followed by an unremarkable start to the new campaign.",
      "Minority owner Jim Ratcliffe has given his backing to the Portuguese coach but his tactical inflexibility has become increasingly frustrating for the home crowd.",
      "While plenty of former United players have had their say as to who should succeed Amorim, one still backing him is Pallister who suggested the 40-year-old still deserved time.",
      "“I don’t think it’s over,” Pallister exclusively told F365. “He’s under immense pressure.",
      "“But we can’t just carry on sacking managers, we need some kind of stability there. But ultimately, he knows if results keep going the way they have been, then the pressure is going to mount. That’s just the nature of football. You can’t hide away from that, and I’m sure he’s aware of that. I think he said it himself.”",

      "Pallister did though address Amorim’s reluctance to deviate from his preferred 3-4-3 formation, saying that while it is good to have a system, a manager needs to be able to change it during a game.",
      "“He’s not for changing with his system, which is what everybody seems to be talking about,” four-time Premier League winner Pallister said. “I would like to see him being a little bit more adaptable because if it doesn’t work like that, change it within the game.",
      "“That, I believe, is what’s not working. Maybe change it, otherwise you’re just making the same mistakes time and time again.",
      "“And we talk about managers not having a plan B – at the moment, that doesn’t look like a plan B. We’re sticking to it, and that’s all fair and well starting with that but if it’s not working, why can’t you change it within the game?”",
      "Next for Amorim is a trip to Anfield, a stadium United have not won at in over a decade, and Pallister conceded if United are “humiliated”, the pressure will build on Amorim’s job.",
      "“Massive game coming up against Liverpool on Sunday,” he said. “The victories so far have been against 10-man Chelsea and Burnley and Sunderland, who came up from the Championship last year, and both at home.",
      "“So you’re looking at that and saying ‘okay, this is another big test’ and this is a massive test. If we go there and get humiliated then the pressure is going to build. So, fingers crossed.”",

      "As the Premier League clubs prepare to vote on a new ‘salary cap’ rule known as ‘anchoring’ we’ve crunched some already-crunched numbers to work out exactly why Chelsea and the Manchester clubs are in a state of panic.",
      "Under the proposed system, clubs would be limited to spending no more than five times the broadcast and prize revenue earned by the team finishing last in the Premier League on their ‘football squad costs’, which include wages, amortisation (transfer fees spread over duration of contract) and agents’ fees.",
      "Based on the 2024/2025 prize money table, that would mean a spending limit of £546m for Premier League clubs.",
      "Anchoring would work on top of the squad-cost ratio rules (SCR), which could replace the existing profit and sustainability rules which permit losses of £105m over three years. SCR limits spending to 85% of revenue.",
      "To be approved, the proposal would require support from at least 14 of the 20 clubs, and unsurprisingly, Manchester United chief Sir Jim Ratcliffe is dead set against the idea.",
      "“[Anchoring] would inhibit the top clubs in the Premier League,” Ratcliffe said. “And the last thing you want is for the top clubs in the Premier League not to be able to compete with Real Madrid, Barcelona, Bayern Munich, PSG – that’s absurd. And if it does, it then ceases to be the finest league in the world.”",
      "Is that “the last thing you want”? Answers on a postcard. It’s undoubtedly the last thing United want, along with Manchester City and Chelsea, who would now be in breach if the rules were in place this season.",
      "Well, we don’t quite know. The wages and amortisation figures we’ve used from the brilliant Swiss Ramble are from the 2023/2024 season, along with the agent and intermediary payments from 2024/2025, but it gives us a decent idea, so we’ve ranked Premier League teams (excluding the relegated/promoted trios) from lowest season expenditure to highest.",
      "The proposal is for a second breach to be dealt with by a six-point deduction, with an additional point for every £6.5m spent over the £546m mark, so we’ve also worked out just how many points the three offenders would have been docked.",

      "Peter Schmeichel has hit out at Manchester United over five mistakes in the transfer market, including one summer signing brought in purely because one “powerful” Red Devils chief just had to “make a mark” at the club.",
      "Ruben Amorim remains under significant pressure at United – he’s second in the sack race – having picked up just 37 points in his 34 Premier League games in charge and faces the daunting task of Liverpool at Anfield as they return to action after the international break on Sunday.",
      "And Schmeichel is baffled by his former club’s moves in the transfer market; in particular their £66m signing of Benjamin Sesko from RB Leipzig to replace Rasmus Hojlund, who moved to Napoli.",
      "While Sesko has two goals in eight appearances for United this term, Hojlund has hit the ground running in Naples, scoring four in six, having been given the service that Schmeichel believes he would have received at Old Trafford had he remained at the club.",
      "“At United you’ve got a head coach [Ruben Amorim], then you had a director of football [Dan Ashworth], a technical director or whatever Jason Wilcox’s title is, and you’ve got a head of recruitment [Christopher Vivell], who is very powerful,” he told BBC podcast Sacked in the Morning.",
      "“You’ve got a lot of people deciding on who is coming in.",
      "“For instance, the signing of Benjamin Sesko was a little bit weird to me because we have Rasmus Hojlund, who has been starved of service for two years.",
      "“You only have to see what he’s doing at Napoli with Kevin de Bruyne and Scott McTominay to play with – he’s scoring goals.",
      "“I’ve consistently said this for two and a half years – Rasmus Hojlund will be a 25-goals-a-year striker for Manchester United, but he needs service.",
      "“We let him go on the stats that he scored very little goals last season and bring Sesko in at the time we bring in Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbuemo, who would give Hojlund first-class service.”",
      "On top of signing Sesko and getting rid of Hojlund, Schmiechel is also struggling to understand United’s failure to sign a new No.6 and not bringing in an experienced goalkeeper, claiming Vivell has a “different agenda” to Amorim.",
      "He added: “You spend £70m-plus on Sesko, when we don’t have the number six we should have, and there’s the goalkeeping position as well.",
      "“This season alone we’ve conceded nine goals from goalkeeping errors. When I played, when Edwin van der Sar played, when David de Gea played, the brief was win 10 points a season, you don’t give points away.",
      "“Why did we bring someone in that we didn’t need? Because the head of recruitment comes from Leipzig [also Sesko’s former club] and he’s got to make a mark.",
      "“When I played, the manager [Sir Alex Ferguson] was in charge. He said ‘him in and him out’. Now it’s different people with different agendas that decide. How can you create a stable environment to have a football team that can go out and win every game?”",

      "Finally, Schmeichel claimed United made a big mistake in selling Scott McTominay, who drove Napoli to the Scudetto last season despite being “so Manchester United”.",
      "“What’s he doing at Napoli?” said Schmeichel. “He is so Manchester United.",
      "“The problem was his versatility, because you have players who can only play in one position. Managers didn’t trust him to build the team around. They want the neat players. He was the victim of that time and again.",
      "“Phil Neville was a little bit the same. He never really got a starting XI spot, but he played an awful lot of games because he could play different roles.",
      "“I don’t get why those two are at Napoli. You will get no-one with more enthusiasm for Manchester United than Rasmus Hojlund. He was writing about playing for the club when he was 10 years old. He’s a massive fan.",
      "“And the fans love him because he was working so hard for the team and he never complained.”",
      "According to reports, one Manchester United transfer is very likely to be completed, while INEOS are ‘in agreement’ over another deal.",

Another five ‘wildcard’ picks – chosen by the Tuttosport editorial staff – have been included to complete the 25-player shortlist.",
      "Ten of the nominees hail from the Premier League and Chelsea have the joint-most players in contention, along with Real Madrid and PSG.",

      "There were rumours ahead of their match against Sunderland that a bad result could see Man Utd look into replacements for Ruben Amorim over the international break.",
      "Amorim seems one poor result away from extra pressure at the moment, due to their inconsistent form, and the Man Utd head coach faces Liverpool at Anfield in his side’s first match back after the international break.",
      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe wants to judge Amorim after three years at Old Trafford but the Portuguese’s record of 37 points from 34 Premier League matches is surely setting alarm bells ringing in the boardroom.",
      "But they could support Amorim in January as Man Utd are still struggling to score goals with just nine in their first seven Premier League matches of the season.",

      "And now Spanish publication Fichajes insists that Man Utd have ‘identified a more than interesting target in the Middle East’ to give Benjamin Sesko some competition.",
      "Man Utd are ‘keeping a close eye on’ Retegui, who moved from Atalanta to Saudi Pro League side Al-Qadsiah last summer, and they have added him to ‘their list of candidates to strengthen their forward line’.",
      "The Spanish outlet adds: ‘Reports estimate that United could pay between 50 and 60 million euros (£44m and £52m) for his signing, a figure that pales in comparison to what Al Qadsiah paid, but which could convince if they negotiate well.",
      "‘The English club sees Retegui as an interesting player to complement or compete with its current attacking options. His recent performances support this.’",
      "Retegui has scored three goals in four Saudi Pro League appearances, while he has contributed four goals and four assists in Italy’s last four World Cup qualifiers.",

      "Another classic international break is in the books, and who could forget the thrills and spills of England’s rollercoaster ride to an easy 3-0 win over Wales and an easy 5-0 win over Latvia?",
      "Truly, the history books will have to be rewritten. Everything else is a footnote. England are going to the World Cup. We thought they might.",
      "We all know there’s a conspicuous elephant in the England selection room right now and we’re sure you’re eager to see just how far Jude Bellingham has fallen here. Some of you may even have skipped ahead. Naughty, but we’ll forgive you.",
      "Personally we’re more interested in just how far Djed Spence has climbed, but we fully appreciate that might just be us.",
      "As ever, the number-one and most important rule to keep in mind with the Ladder is this: this is not our top 50, but our best guess at what we think Thomas Tuchel’s top 50 is. And, just to set ourselves thoroughly up for November’s disastrous fall, we do think we’re starting to get a handle on how he’s approaching the job now. And who that is good/bad news for.",
      "Last month’s England Ladder is here for your perusal, with the brackets below indicating each player’s ranking within it.",
      "",
      "And just like we always do and just like we knew we would again, after bumping Kane down a spot just to feel alive we pop him straight back to the top. Has perhaps never been under less threat for his starting spot in this team, and does seem like a fever dream now to consider he was struggling so much during the Euros last summer that actual cheers greeted him being replaced by Ollie Watkins.",
      "The lack of competition for his place might be of more concern if he wasn’t just so unbelievably brilliant. We will still fight anyone who says he’s playing better than ever; he’s just doing all the same incredible things he did for years and years and years except instead of doing them for a silly team in a truly elite league he’s doing them for a truly elite team in a silly league.",
      "But the key thing here is the incredibleness and brilliance. Even those of us who believe his real goal tally to be zero must accept that Kane is now quite likely to reach 100 goals for a country where for over a century the 50-goal mark appeared to represent an unbreakable ceiling.",
      "Ronaldo-like longevity cannot be ruled out for a player who looks after himself impeccably, making it highly conceivable that when his England career does finally end he will have twice as many goals as any other England player in history.",
      "And people will still argue he isn’t an all-time great. Maybe he just needs a haircut.",
      "",
      "Just a brilliant player whose role and its importance grows with every game for both club and country. A perfect example of how stepping up in class as he did when leaving West Ham for Arsenal can help mould an excellent player into a truly world-class one.",
      "Very little more you could want from a midfielder than what Rice now delivers on a regular basis, and his set-piece prowess in particular absolutely screams tight-tournament-game difference-maker.",
      "As we say in every Ladder these days, the numbers next to his and Harry Kane’s names are largely meaningless because both are absolute nailed-on certainties.",
      "",
      "Has played every competitive game since Thomas Tuchel took over and has conceded not one goal. Quality of opposition a factor, for sure, but it’s still a remarkable degree of faultlessness for a player who absolutely loves playing for England and has become exceptionally good at it.",
      "",
      "Brilliant against Wales, quieter against Latvia, still we’re pretty certain when push comes to tournament shove a definite starter on the right in a full-strength England team, no matter how persuasive and admirable and extremely-useful-to-have-around-just-in-case the charms of Noni Madueke may be.",
      "As it is for England, so it is for Arsenal. It’s a very good situation for both, and there’s no real need to complicate it beyond that, we don’t think.",
      "",
      "Lovely to have him back in an England shirt for the first time in a year, and it just looked and felt right to have him there. There really is a lovely experienced and reassuringly reliable spine to that England team with Stones back in position ahead of Pickford and behind Rice and Kane.",
      "",
      "Continues to look utterly suited to and entirely unflustered by international football, and that partnership with Rice already looks like one that manages the neat yet deceptively difficult trick for a midfield duo of highlighting and accentuating each man’s strengths rather than each man’s flaws.",
      "It’s a trick that has quite famously proved beyond some of England’s very best central midfielders ever.",
      "One of the biggest and most significant problems to which Tuchel had to find a swift answer on this short sprint to attempted World Cup glory was ‘Who partners Declan Rice in midfield?’",
      "It is no longer a big or significant problem.",
      "",
      "His absence against Latvia was reportedly nothing more than ‘managing minutes’ so for now we’re still assuming he’s ahead of Ezri Konsa in the centre-back pecking order but there’s no real doubt now that both are in the top three of said centre-back pecking order.",
      "We very much enjoyed his ‘centre-back playmaker’ role against Wales. You just don’t see that often.",
      "",
      "Injured Reece James is injured. So, so utterly frustrating, but it does at least appear on this occasion that his latest absence from England duty was precautionary rather than strictly necessary and represented just some sensible club-country joint dialogue and decision-making towards a mutually beneficial final outcome.",
      "We’re very sure that a fully fit James is Tuchel’s first-choice right-back, given their history and James’ quality, but above all that because of the fact that in his absence during this break Tuchel didn’t actually even take the chance to look at a different right-back.",
      "Centre-back Ezri Konsa did the job for most of the Wales game, with left-back Djed Spence finishing that job and then staying there for the Latvia game.",
      "A left-back doing a passable fill-in job at right-back was at least a fun little Tuchel reversal of one of Gareth Southgate’s favourite tropes.",
      "",
      "We find ourselves in agreement with Tuchel but not, perhaps, with a majority of England fans that Gordon is the first-choice starter on the left-wing now.",
      "As with Morgan Rogers, the evidence Tuchel is showing us tells us that’s how he sees it, Gordon having started each of the last three games.",
      "We didn’t really understand much of the criticism of Gordon’s performance against Wales. The frustration that the end product wasn’t quite there is fine, but it seemed to be overplayed in regard to what was there, which was further evidence of how Gordon’s direct running on the left offers a counterpoint and contrast to England’s more methodical and patient approach elsewhere, giving them the ability to alter the pace and direction of their attacks in a pleasingly defence-disorienting manner.",
      "He also struck up an instant rapport with Djed Spence that possibly answers another of England’s thornier pre-World Cup posers.",
      "But even if the criticisms after Wales were valid, the Latvia performance silenced them. Created a big early chance for Harry Kane – and if you create a big chance for Harry Kane at this moment in time and don’t end up with an assist to show for it you can count yourself particularly unfortunate – before grabbing his chance to score a brilliant counter-attack goal the one moment Latvia’s back nine were briefly otherwise engaged on a rare and foolhardy attack .",
      "Your mileage may vary, but for us for now – and, far more importantly, for Tuchel – he’s won the battle with Marcus Rashford.",
      "",
      "A better showing against Latvia really would have been even more persuasive but when you combine the fact Rogers has started four of England’s last five qualifiers, including each of the last three in the No. 10 position, with everything Tuchel has side about backing and continuing to select the men in possession who are doing the business for him it becomes impossible to conclude anything other than that at this moment of time Rogers is England’s first choice in that position.",
      "And, as ever, while we may call it ‘our’ F365 England Ladder it is always nothing more nor less than our best guess at figuring out the current England manager’s Ladder.",
      "Sweep away all the narrative and the discourse and the noise, and when viewed like that it’s pretty clear how the land currently lies.",
      "",
      "Resurrected his Tottenham career in spectacular style last season, culminating in Europa League glory and a long-awaited chance for another trophy-and-cigars photo op, and now spending this season making a momentous climb in the England standings.",
      "In the summer, we had him down at 47 among the ‘might be in with a shot if injuries strike, we suppose’ afterthought slots, far too close to Phil Neville for comfort. By last month he’d jumped into a tentative ‘could make the final squad, actually’ position. And now we think he’s Tuchel’s first-choice left-back. Fight us.",
      "He’s the best pure defender England have available among their vast array of full-back options, probably on either flank, and our argument would be this: if you’re starting him, as Tuchel did in both games here, in friendlies and straightforward easily-won qualifiers, then you are surely definitely going to start him in your actual tournament games where defending might actually matter.",
      "Despite starting his career the other way round, Spence is now definitely a left-back who can do a job at right-back, and for England that really is probably the more useful way round to be. Is clearly working on becoming a more effective contributor to the attacking side of the game, and, while Wales were startlingly and surprisingly flimsy opposition at Wembley, there were plenty of encouraging signs in the way he and Gordon linked up on the left flank that night.",
      "He just looks the right fit at the right time, and a potentially huge beneficiary of Tuchel walking the walk with his ‘backing the players who deliver for me’ approach to selection.",
      "READ: Roy Keane guilty of lazy stereotypes with Djed Spence ‘defensive side’ worries",
      "",
      "The elephant in the room and the press have basically already told us this is going to be the only talking point for the now-moribund November international break. With England qualifying in record time and flawless fashion (six games, six wins, no goals conceded remember) something has to be bad and terrible and that something is going to be the Bellingham Situation. It already is the Bellingham Situation, but next month’s Bellingham Week will plumb fresh depths.",
      "And there’s no way out of it for any of us now. It’s going to be all the media want to talk about, which they will combine with sad shaking of their heads as if they are not responsible for any of it. And this happens especially if Tuchel picks him in November, but especially if he doesn’t.",
      "Which brings us to the big question for our purposes. Will Tuchel in fact pick him? It does seem to have been almost entirely overlooked and/or forgotten that this is a player who’s played about 120 minutes of football this season and for whom a fortnight spent building up fitness and sharpness really might prove just more useful in the long term than playing in two really very low-key and low-pressure internationals for England.",
      "But we must also consider that Tuchel is not keeping secrets or playing games. He’s very, very clear: he will back the players who deliver for him, and across the last two Bellingham-less international breaks, England’s non-Bellinghams have delivered for him. Tuchel even suggested Bukayo Saka only got back in this time because Noni Madueke, in Tuchel’s eyes the man in possession, was injured.",
      "This one really does feel like it’s more about Bellingham now than Tuchel. The England manager has no vendetta against Bellingham and nothing he’s said suggests he has any problem at all with picking him again in the future. But Tuchel is evidently now very comfortable with not picking Bellingham, and England’s results mean only Bellingham can change that. He has to a) play and b) play well for Real Madrid.",
      "If he does that, we’re pretty sure Tuchel will pick him. But it still feels pretty wild to be having any of this kind of uncertainty about a player who has for several Ladders in a row now formed part of the straightforward default top five. A group including Kane, Rice, Saka and Pickford, where, sure, there might be some internal shuffling of the order amongst them but you were still always dealing with the core five inked-in certain starters. At the very, very least, Bellingham is no longer part of that little group.",
      "",
      "An international break that did absolutely no harm to Konsa’s rock-solid squad-member status. Did a perfectly passable job as right-back in the first game before slotting seamlessly into his more customary centre-back role for the second.",
      "Neither game was among the more arduous of Konsa’s career, but there was one excellent tracking run and last-gasp chance-snuffing tackle for the highlight reel in Riga.",
      "He’s still one player where we will deviate slightly from the general rule that Tuchel’s most recent starters are his starters, because there are explanations as to why Konsa started both games.",
      "We don’t think he starts when everyone is available, given the explanations at hand for why Konsa started these games – and did so in different positions.",
      "What he definitely hasn’t done is fall many rungs from his previous ‘just outside the starting XI’ position.",
      "",
      "Seems very unlikely Henderson could play his way into a first-choice starting role in England’s dynamic new midfield, but also feels even less likely he could now play his way out of his current squad role as canny senior pro and standards-setter.",
      "Again, we don’t need to overcomplicate this one. Tuchel has picked him in his squad at every opportunity, but started him in a game only once, with five further caps coming as a relatively late substitute.",
      "You don’t necessarily have to agree with it or like it, but you can’t argue with the role clarity on display here.",
      "",
      "A very lively cameo from the bench in Riga adds another layer of intrigue to the No. 10 battle, while Eze also obviously offers another tantalising option in the wide areas.",
      "Has made four appearances for England during this qualifying campaign, with three of those as substitute for the last 30-odd minutes.",
      "We’ve said it before and we’ll say it again: we’re still getting to know Tuchel and his ways and, while we do think we’re getting the hang of him now, when he shows us how he sees a player with this level of clarity we will cheerfully go along with it.",
      "Eze is a valued and valuable member of the squad, a dynamic game-changing option from the bench, but not yet a regular starter. All of that is absolutely fine.",
      "",
      "Got himself a goal in a decent enough performance against Wales, and we have absolutely no problem at all with Watkins filling that all-important Harry Kane’s Back-up role that exists in any England squad.",
      "What we do have a problem with is the fact Watkins now appears to be pretty much as unchallenged for that particular role as Kane is for his.",
      "",
      "Deeply unfortunate injury timing given how well he was playing for both club and country, but when he returns we fully expect him to be a thoroughly capable and entirely trusted Saka back-up for both club and country.",
      "",
      "Came on for Gordon in both games this month. A slight curiosity of that is that this therefore represents a break where his place within the squad has become more assured even as he has slipped slightly further away from a starting berth.",
      "Does just feel like Tuchel prefers what Gordon offers on that left-hand side, but Rashford has done himself no harm with his form for Barcelona or work during this camp, and offers a nice level of international and big-tournament know-how in a squad that is still a bit of a mix of a handful of extremely experienced veterans and a whole bunch of excellent but quite inexperienced players, yet not all that many in the 40-80 cap sweet spot.",
      "",
      "Current reports suggest an eight-week lay-off for Livramento after that nasty looking injury against Arsenal. Could have been better, could also have been much worse. But it does mean that he’s also set to miss the November international break and hand Djed Spence further opportunity to bed himself in as England’s first-choice left-back, a position that had looked there for Livramento’s taking.",
      "",
      "Assorted injury hassles have restricted him to barely an hour of football for England during Thomas Tuchel’s reign to date, meaning he is one player it is still desperately hard to place. Is he a Gordon, or is he a Foden? We just don’t yet quite know exactly how Tuchel sees him.",
      "This is where we were with just about every player a few windows ago; it’s a relief at least that Palmer is now something of an outlier in that regard.",
      "",
      "Still the only other goalkeeper Tuchel has used besides Pickford during his eight games in charge, sitting on the bench in the No. 13 shirt for each of the other seven.",
      "Ergo: he’s the second-choice keeper until we see some kind of evidence that he isn’t.",
      "",
      "An obviously excellent footballer but perhaps the least starry of England’s many, many attacking options across both flanks.",
      "Yet we must again defer to the evidence Tuchel is presenting us. Bowen has been involved in all but one of the international breaks for which Tuchel has been in charge, and has made an appearance in five of the six games for which he’s been in the squad.",
      "And if you’re a fringe player who was going to miss out on one international break so far under Tuchel, you would definitely want it to be that grisly one in the summer where England scraped a wholly unconvincing 1-0 qualifying win over Andorra before losing a friendly to Senegal.",
      "Shrewd work from Bowen; the only other Tuchel game in which he’s played no part at all was the other game against Andorra, in which England were scruffy 2-0 winners.",
      "Causation and correlation be damned; the facts are that Bowen has played some part in Tuchel’s five most convincing matches as manager of England, and no part in the three least convincing. If nothing else, it’s a handy knack.",
      "",
      "A key rule of Thomas Tuchel England squads does appear to be that once you’re in them, it is up to someone else to force you out. And after seven years in the international wilderness, Loftus-Cheek is now very much in Tuchel’s England squads.",
      "",
      "In the squad again, and came off the bench against Latvia to perform a role that mainly amounted to being a very, very large target for England’s flurry of free-kicks and corners in the closing minutes of a long-settled contest.",
      "What it does do is tell us that he’s still one of Tuchel’s four centre-back picks at this stage, albeit clearly the least secure with Stones, Guehi and Konsa all looking like World Cup certainties.",
      "",
      "Look, third-choice keeper is rarely a position to worry yourself about unduly. If you reach a point in a tournament where you’re using your third-choice keeper, you’re probably already mired in deep and inescapable sh*t anyway.",
      "And the fact Trafford has sat on the bench as third-choice keeper for every single one of Tuchel’s games to date remains the most compelling data point available to us.",
      "But there’s an obvious cloud on the horizon here with Trafford having lost the No. 1 spot at Man City to Gianluigi Donnarumma.",
      "Pretty hard to argue at this time that if England did find themselves having to actually use a third-choice keeper that you’d be more reassured to see Trafford out there than, say, Nick Pope.",
      "",
      "If you’re a promising young midfielder and Pep Guardiola says he wants to turn you into a full-back, let him. Earned his first senior call-up this month after Reece James’ withdrawal, and while he didn’t get his chance in the end against either Wales or Latvia nor did any other right-back.",
      "Which means under the rules of Tuchelism, O’Reilly is in until he isn’t. Because there has to be another full-back in there; you cannot possibly pick Reece James as your only specialist right-back and then rely on Spence or a shuffled-along centre-back as your only cover.",
      "Whether that ends up being O’Reilly or someone less rogue, time will tell. But again. Tuchel’s rules, not ours. Nothing we can do about that, apart from the times when we decide we’re simply going to break them.",
      "",
      "Did get some minutes against Wales, but did little with them really. He’s a damn fine player and one of our favourites, but very clearly now sits behind Morgan Rogers and probably Eberechi Eze and, when it comes down to it, almost certainly also Jude Bellingham among England’s really very good No. 10 options. And we’ve not even mentioned Cole Palmer or Phil Foden, until just now, when we did mention them.",
      "With Anderson’s emergence reducing the likelihood of any Bellingham return being alongside rather than in front of Rice in England’s midfield, it does all rather leave Gibbs-White looking like your classic ‘one of six players cut from the provisional squad’ next summer. The James Ward-Prowse role, if you will.",
      "",
      "You felt for him during the Latvia game. Just isn’t playing enough football for Arsenal, and short of a Riccardo Calafiori injury we’re really not sure that’s going to change. It was entirely understandable that he looked so far off it when handed a chance to impress in Riga, but the problem for Lewis-Skelly is that there isn’t really a huge amount he can do about it apart from just knuckle down and hope.",
      "Currently hard to shift the notion that with all things being equal and if nothing materially changes between now and next summer he will find himself behind both Djed Spence and a fit-again Tino Livramento in the pecking order.",
      "And third-choice left-back isn’t usually a great position to be in when tournament squads are being finalised and whittled down.",
      "",
      "Might be a slight case of heart ruling head here because we really do love Wharton and feel like England might have missed a trick with him. Elliot Anderson appears to have locked down a starting spot alongside Rice and that’s all good. We have no issue there; Anderson is a fine player and definitely seems to be one of those who just looks right at home in the international game.",
      "But it would be a massive shame if Tuchel can’t find at least a squad role for someone of Wharton’s supreme talent and ability to offer a fresh approach from an unusual angle. He’s your classic ‘footballer in an era of athletes’ kind of player, one who just sees the game slightly differently, capable of spotting and most importantly delivering the kind of passes others simply cannot.",
      "The concerns around his ability to cover the requisite ground for Tuchelball are valid if dreary, but we do love the idea of Wharton as a bench option for times when a particularly stubborn low block requires unlocking.",
      "And luckily we can bump him up the list slightly here without breaking any of our own rules, because Tuchel himself admitted Wharton was unlucky to be overlooked this time around given his Crystal Palace form.",
      "‘He deserves to be with us,’ Tuchel said after naming his latest squad. Yes, Thomas. Yes he does. If only there were someone who could make that happen.",
      "",
      "Has spent pretty much his entire England career being just about the hardest player to place in the Ladder and the one most likely to make us look very clever and then very stupid on a month-by-month rota basis.",
      "We still don’t have much idea what to do with him and precious little Tuchel-era data to go by. The positive spin on it might be that while Reece James does appear to be Tuchel’s first choice the manager didn’t take the chance to look at any other actual right-backs during James’ absence this month, which would indicate a door that remains there to be opened.",
      "Does, though, still feel like the question at the moment with TAA and the World Cup is not so much ‘Is he in the squad?’ but ‘How far away from the squad is he?’",
      "",
      "Could a great big grown-up year like 2026 really feature a good old-fashioned, full-throated Jack Grealish Clamour? It absolutely f*cking could, you know. We are so back.",
      "",
      "Remember when Tuchel started him over Trent Alexander-Arnold at right-back that time? That was a good bit. And people say Germans have no sense of humour.",
      "",
      "The only way is down until something changes. And that change is going to have to be increasingly drastic while looking increasingly unlikely. Foden is currently destined for an absolute puzzle of an England career.",
      "",
      "Has impressed for Bayer Leverkusen after a summer move Liverpool might live to regret to a fairly hefty degree, and was on the bench for the Wales game before being forced out of the squad to face Latvia by injury. Stones, Guehi and Konsa appear absolute certainties for the final squad, but there does look like being at least one centre-back spot – currently held by Dan Burn – for which competition at least still exists.",
      "",
      "Playing Premier League and Champions League football – and playing them very well indeed apart from that costly 30-second wobble against Arsenal – while England’s third-choice goalkeeper rides the bench at Man City. Has to give him some chance, doesn’t it? And at the very least positions him as a non-panic-inducing option should some misfortune or other befall any of the three keepers currently ahead of him.",
      "",
      "That Senegal game really did hurt a lot of chances for a lot of players.",
      "",

      "READ: World Cup turncoats include £50m Manchester United signing and iconic winner’s son",
      "The report adds: ‘Sources have told The i Paper that Wharton’s effortless ascendancy, along with the fact Baleba seems to struggle with the attention, having not completed a single full 90 minutes for Brighton this term, has caused several senior United figures to rethink their shortlist.’",
      "Transfer insider Graeme Bailey reckons Man Utd could sign a midfielder in January but a loan signing could be more realistic before a big signing in the summer.",
      "Bailey told United In Focus: “It could be the case that we see a midfield signing in January, maybe even a loan before we see a more permanent fixture in the summer.”",
      "On Baleba and Wharton, Bailey added: “And United are fully aware of the prices we are talking about, they know Baleba, Wharton and the like are not £50million or £60million players, they realise they are twice that. Ineos are backing United and know the sort of finances need to compete at the top.”",
      "Brighton chairman Tony Bloom insisted that Man Utd’s pursuit of Baleba was not a saga as the Red Devils very quickly “went away” after learning the midfielder wasn’t available for sale.",
      "Bloom said: “I don’t think Baleba was a saga.There was interest from Manchester United, and we said that he wasn’t available this summer and they went away.",

      "Man Utd boss Ruben Amorim “would be vulnerable” if a UAE-based consortium push through a takeover of the club, according to a journalist.",
      "There was speculation ahead of the match that a heavy defeat could see Amorim facing the sack with the Portuguese head coach gaining just 37 points from 34 Premier League matches since replacing Erik ten Hag last November.",
      "Man Utd co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe came out last week and claimed he wants Amorim to remain in the position for three years to give him the best chance of making his mark.",
      "That is unlikely to happen if Amorim doesn’t improve and Daily Mail journalist Chris Wheeler reckons he’s even more likely to be out of work if a rumoured takeover by UAE-based consortium goes through.",
      "Wheeler said in a Q&A in the Daily Mail: “Ask any manager and they will tell you that new owners and good job prospects rarely go hand in hand. Erik ten Hag was on thin ice the moment Ratcliffe assumed the day-to-day running of the club, and eventually fell through it despite a late reprieve after winning the 2024 FA Cup final.",
      "READ: World Cup turncoats include £50m Manchester United signing and iconic winner’s son",
      "“So Amorim would be vulnerable even if he was on a par with United’s expectations after bringing him in from Sporting Lisbon a year ago and spending heavily on new players to fit his system. A ‘haul’ of just 37 points from his first 34 Premier League games – not to mention no European football and a Carabao Cup exit to League Two Grimsby Town – is well below par.",
      "“Ratcliffe and the hierarchy he has put in place at Old Trafford have invested heavily in Amorim, so it would be embarrassing in the extreme to pull the plug now. A new owner is unlikely to have any such reservations.”",
      "Man Utd spent over £200m on new signings over the summer transfer window with the Red Devils concentrating on improving their frontline.",
      "Many fans and former players reckon it was a mistake to not sign a midfielder but Wheeler insists Man Utd “won’t be short of a few quid” over the next couple of transfer windows as long as they comply with PSR.",
      "Wheeler added: “The latest financials released last month underlined the scale of United’s challenge: the club posted a record £666.5m revenue over the last year, but still made an overall loss of £33m – down 70.8 per cent on the previous year.",
      "“United do have money available, but they have to operate carefully within the Premier League’s Profit and Sustainability rules. Ratcliffe has made investment in the first team his priority, which is why United spent another £236m on new signings this summer – roughly in keeping with previous years.",
      "“A central midfielder was the glaring omission among the five players brought in, which raised questions over the wisdom of signing two No 10s in Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha.",
      "“Whether United need two central midfielders depends largely on the futures of Bruno Fernandes and Kobbie Mainoo, with Casemiro coming to the end of his contract and doubts over Manuel Ugarte’s performances. They will also look to strengthen elsewhere in the team.",
      "“United’s revenue streams will remain strong despite the absence of European football, and the losses are coming down. As long as they stay within PSR, United won’t be short of a few quid in the summer – or even in January – if needed.”",

      "After realising many supporters thought he was talking about himself or another Saudi Arabian party taking over Man Utd, Alalshikh clarified his initial post.",
      "He added the day after: ‘My yesterday’s post about Manchester United’s potential sale meant one thing: the club is in an advanced negotiation phase with a new investor.",
      "‘Just to clarify, I am not the investor, nor are they from my nation. I’m posting this as a fan who wishes the deal to happen, though it might not necessarily happen.’",
      "READ: World Cup turncoats include £50m Manchester United signing and iconic winner’s son",
      "It later emerged on Monday that a UAE-based consortium, who are ‘very serious’ about buying the club, held a meeting in London earlier this week with Man Utd officials.",
      "Former CBS Sports journalist Jacobs insists that the deal could be “advanced” but only “in terms of internally putting itself together”.",
      "Jacobs said on talkSPORT: “It’s not Saudi. I’m getting denials from sources that it’s Qatar and that Sheikh Jassim may return. But there is a group specifically from the UAE that are interested and are exploring whether or not they can put together a consortium and have actually approached some ex-Manchester United players not to invest, but to be ambassadors.",
      "“That’s where we’re at the moment. This group may be advanced in terms of internally putting itself together, but they haven’t placed a bid, nor have they even alerted the Glazers yet. We’ll have to wait and see how it develops.”",
      "The Athletic‘s Laurie Whitwell has a theory that the Glazers are trying to get some interest going in Man Utd before they attempt to sell in 2027.",
      "Speaking on the Talk of the Devils podcast, Whitwell said: “Some people will now say that it’s in the Glazers’ interest before February to get a new deal in place with somebody else because that creates competitive tension and they get a higher price for their shares.",
      "“But also after that point, why would anybody want to buy the club now, because there is this automatic minimum there, so why wouldn’t they just wait until February 2027?",
      "“So maybe all this kind of chatter, is it because the Glazers want to – I don’t know, I’m theorizing here – but there’s a world where they could want to get some interest around it to get something going before that deadline.",
      "“After that, they might not be able to get the same kind of price. It’s a fascinating dynamic.”",
      "Journalist Andy Mitten also had his say on the takeover rumours, he said: “I don’t have any evidence of the investment. And I’m a little bit sceptical because I’ve seen people before say stuff that doesn’t end up being true, and then they get caught out and say, ‘Whoa, I was only sort of saying what I’ve heard.’ And they realise that there’s a level of scrutiny to this, that they’ve got to back up what they’ve said.”",
      "Host of the podcast, Ian Irving, added: “You think he (Turki Alsheikh) would be aware of that, though, considering his position and considering his social media following. He knows what impact that tweet is going to make.”",
      "Mitten replied: “I would have thought Rio Ferdinand would have been aware when he said Manchester United are going to be taken over by Qatar, which was completely baseless. Sometimes people make mistakes.”",
      "Before he continued: “From Manchester United’s perspective, they’ve got absolutely no idea of this, but the Glazers are hardly going to be ringing around journalists to say what it is.”",
      "Some Man Utd legends have been ‘approached’ by a UAE-based consortium looking to buy the club from the Glazers, according to reports.",
      "Man Utd officials are holding a ‘meeting’ today with a UAE-based consortium who are ‘very serious’ about buying the club, according to reports.",
      "It could be in the Glazer family’s interest to sell Man Utd ‘before February 2027’ amid takeover rumours, according to reports."

      "Last month Paul Scholes made headlines by calling Rashford a “disgrace” for the way he conducted himself in his final months at the club before an Aston Villa loan last January.",
      "And although Keane did not go as far as Scholes as he spoke about Rashford on ITV during their coverage of England’s World Cup qualifier with Latvia, he has said that Rashford cannot be exonerated for his part in making United a poor environment for players.",
      "You would have to say that Keane probably has a point – Rashford had very clearly checked out of Manchester United long before he actually left, though he might argue that the chicken came before the egg.",
      "Keane said: “Towards the end of his time at United, there was obviously issues. He was part of the problem with the environment, especially one of the most experienced players at United.",
      "“He should have been setting the standards and showing new people at he club what it’s like to be a United player. But that’s been well documented.",

      "“If you’re part of the environment and you’re causing problems at the club by being late and not being a top pro then you’re part of the problem, you’re not helping the environment.",
      "“He’s got to mature a little bit. He’s 27 so there’s plenty of time for him and I don’t begrudge him another chance.”",
      "Keane is at least mature enough to wish Rashford well, in contrast to Scholes, who pointedly said he struggled to feel happy for the former United trainee in his new life in Spain.",

After two months, Cunha admitted he felt like he had been at United for a lot longer because “of the club’s current situation”. He spoke of the pressure he felt to start getting results as quickly as possible because he is “a big signing”. At one point he even referred to himself in the third person.",
      "Cunha’s interview revealed that the catastrophic aura surrounding the club from fans and pundits is seeping through to the players. If Fergie’s United used to give players an air of invincibility, Amorim – and those who came before him – seem to instill a sense of crisis.",
      "With one billion fans across the world, the biggest challenge for any player moving to United is the weight of expectation and the pressure that comes with that. Usually a manager’s job would be to protect players but when he himself is facing daily questions about his tenure, it is understandable that the players get caught in the crossfire.",

      "That environment is hardly conducive to success and there is a growing list of players who leave and begin playing like they aren’t carrying an Indiana Jones-style boulder on their back. Scott McTominay has become a deity in Naples. Antony looked a lot more like an £86million footballer at Betis than he did at United. Marcus Rashford seems to have remembered that football can be quite fun and not a massive burden now that he is in Barcelona. Even Rasmus Hojlund looks like a striker.",
      "Joining United has become one of the smarter career moves if only for the immediate boost you get on exit and it is easy to see a scenario where Cunha becomes another example,",
      "The Brazilian is undoubtedly talented and undeniably kept Wolves in the Premier League last season, but he has been signed to a system where he has no obvious place.",
      "At Wolves, the team was built around him, allowing him to line up on the team sheet as a centre-forward but not really play like one. In Amorim’s 3-4-2-1, there is no obvious space to do that.",
      "The Portuguese boss is not the first manager to fall in love with Mason Mount, which means his starting spot is pretty much locked down. Benjamin Sesko has scored twice since he started leading the line and Bryan Mbeumo is more suited to a wide-right role than Cunha.",
      "Cunha may well be a £62.5million signing that has no obvious place in the team. The player himself commented on this, bringing up his youth spell as a midfielder before 4-3-3 took over the game and he suddenly had to become a number nine.",
      "“I came to the national team with this stereotype of a number 9 shirt,” Cunha said.",
      "“I played my entire base as a midfielder, and when I became a professional, I encountered the world of 4-3-3. You have to adapt: either play centre-forward, winger, or ‘eight’.",
      "“They eliminated the midfielder position, and you have to adapt.",
      "“But I see it positively, as it has given me experience, many more positions, and even more so in short-term tournaments with the national team.",
      "“Having a versatile player is a huge help for any coach.”",
      "While it’s true that versatility is a positive trait, it can also make it hard to nail down a position. Amorim began the season with Cunha as the centre forward but pulled him deeper after the signing of Sesko, and there is every chance that for United’s next game away at Liverpool, Cunha is again on the bench as he was for the win over Sunderland.",
      "Cunha started up front for Brazil in the first game of this international break and although he did not score, he did provide an assist. After his time with Brazil is over, he heads back to the doom and gloom of United and if it feels like a long time after two months, just imagine how long it will feel come the end of a most likely underwhelming season.",

      "Borson added: “It just seems to me that it would be quite odd timing, and given how thorough the process was before that didn’t flush out this kind of proposal, why now when things are worse would somebody be prepared to pay more?",
      "“It’s a harder deal to do now than it was two years ago, so why would that make sense now? The economic picture is not as good. They’ve got the stadium situation. You’ve got Jim Ratcliffe in the way.",

      "There’s countless good videos and articles on this (Athletic, Coaches Voice etc) but with an oversimplification, any formation that emphasises 3 at the back and two wingbacks is really a better out-of-possession than in-possession style team. If you want your team to be a smart counter-puncher prioritising quick turnovers and attacks, then it can be good, if you tailor your squad to that specific tactic. Oliver Glasner’s Crystal Palace are the best current incarnation of this.",
      "What this formation doesn’t give you however is an abundance of on-ball creation/high possession – in effect you sacrifice some midfield creativity to get that extra CB in, and in many cases, you now rely on your WBs to either provide the crucial width, or sometimes be the ones popping up in the half spaces in front of the boxes. Now they could be quite creative in their own right (Frimpong at Bayer) but they’re still not true attacking players, so when facing a set defence, they’re unlikely to offer the attacking threat of a dedicated winger/forward – they need to be in a mismatch situation.",
      "There are two notable exceptions – Conte’s Chelsea and Alonso’s Bayer – but both of those were a) one off seasons exploiting unique situations and b) successfully countered by the following season/underwent serious regression.",
      "Assuming you want United to dominate in a similar vein to the most successful teams of the last 30 years in the PL, you want to be consistently controlling possession, having the best attacking talent getting space in dangerous areas and generating high value chances whilst limiting them at the back. Even with the slight shift towards increased verticality in the PL this season, the better teams are clearly still prioritising controlling the midfield with men and quality.",
      "Now, clearly if you have flexibility within your formation (ultimately what made Alonso’s Bayer work was the sheer unpredictability of where any given player would be with their great passing interchanges) that can overcome some of these problems, but what makes Amorim such a poor coach (at this point) is both his formational AND tactical rigidity – he doesn’t just play the same structure, but within that structure plays the same way, making him exceptionally predictable.",
      "There are other elements (smaller pool of specialists that excel at these formations means less talent at a higher price point available to purchase) which IMO prevent 3-4-3 from establishing itself fully, but yeah in essence, more good attacking players having the ball often, and in better areas really should be United’s modus operandi, and 3-4-3 ain’t that.\nTom (also, Ian, that Liverpool team were… not that good) Leyton",

But football games around the world, at both national and club level, is a violent affair.",

      "Danny Murphy has used Arne Slot’s situation at Liverpool to explain why Sir Jim Ratcliffe’s recent comments about Man Utd boss Ruben Amorim were “ill advised”.",
      "The Red Devils had an awful 2024/25 campaign with Amorim failing to qualify for Europe in his first season at the club after Man Utd finished 15th in the Premier League.",
      "And it’s been similar so far this term with the Red Devils show lots of inconsistent form after winning three, losing three and drawing one of their seven Premier League matches, while they were knocked out of the League Cup by League Two Grimsby Town.",
      "Amorim has picked up just 37 points from 34 Premier League matches since taking over from Erik ten Hag towards the beginning of last season.",

      "READ: Man United, Liverpool and Arsenal stars in danger of missing out on expanded 48-team World Cup",
      "After that match, an interview was released in which Ratcliffe suggested that Amorim could be afforded three years to get it right at Man Utd.",
      "The Red Devils’ first game back after the international break is against defending champions Liverpool, who have lost their last three matches in all competitions, and former Reds midfielder Murphy insists Ratcliffe’s comments about Amorim’s future were “ill advised”.",
      "Murphy told BetWright: “I think Sir Jim Ratcliffe got cornered a bit and wasn’t especially well prepared for the interview where he talked about giving Ruben Amorim three years to turn things around at Manchester United. I don’t think he should have said that and it’s inevitably going to come back to bite him.",
      "“If United lose their next three or four games, the pressure from the fans will get too much and the board will have no choice but to sack Amorim.",
      "“Ratcliffe would have been better off saying that the board are backing the manager and that they’re being patient, whilst recognising that it isn’t going to be the easiest of tasks – but it would at least show that they are right behind him.",
      "“The reality is you can’t make any guarantees in football. You could argue that with Liverpool winning the league in Arne Slot’s first season at the club – you can’t make a guarantee that he will be there in three years and they’re flying.",
      "“In my opinion, it was ill advised of Ratcliffe to not have an answer prepared for each of those questions and it will probably come back to bite him in six months’ time.”",

      "Liverpool legend Nicol reckons Mainoo has “been found out” under Amorim and the Man Utd midfielder needs to improve his defensive game.",
      "Nicol told ESPN: “In my opinion, Mainoo is great with the ball at his feet but when the opposition has the ball, he doesn’t do enough.",
      "“In fact, he doesn’t do anything. He doesn’t stop people getting at Man Utd back four. And the fact that that is one of the biggest problems United have and this guy still can’t figure it out.",
      "“I think basically he’s been found out because at the end of the day, when you play for the top clubs and you want to be challenging, your players have to contribute on both sides of the ball.",
      "“And if there is one thing Mainoo doesn’t do, it’s contribute defensively.",
      "“The fact that Casemiro is starting over him consistently tells you that there is a problem and the kid is not as good as we thought he was when he first burst onto the scene.”",
      "When asked if Amorim could help Mainoo improve those aspects of his game, Nicol added: “It’s interesting you say work with him, because it looks like the work rate on that side isn’t there.",
      "“Any coach who has a player who he thinks isn’t giving their all, when it comes to having to play one guy or another, that guy is getting shoved away.",
      "“If you’re the coach at United and you’re watching Mainoo time after time letting people run off them and looking as though you are not that bothered about it, you’re going to the bottom of the pile.”",

      "“I believe a lot in Kobbie but some of you think that Kobbie Mainoo is already done. I think he can do so much better. He can improve in a lot.",
      "“And sometimes I think for some guys it’s [the level he’s playing at now] enough. For him, it’s not enough. Maybe it’s not fair but I think I’m helping Kobbie Mainoo and that’s it.",
      "“He will have opportunities like the other guys. If I feel during the week that he’s the best player to play, he’s going to play and I proved that already to every player here.",
      "“I believe a lot in him. I have the same thing [opinion] that you have and that is a top, top player, but he can be so much better, so I’m focused on that.”",

      "Nothing like an October international break in which England don’t even play a competitive game until the very last moment to leave you pondering choices. Your own, mainly, but also those of football clubs.",
      "Relentlessly silly, frequently stupid football clubs. The regrets. The f*ck-ups. Call them what you will, but here’s just 10 things Premier League clubs might now wish worked out differently.",
      "Some are entirely self-inflicted f*cktastrophes, some are unfortunate circumstance, and the rest some combination of the two.",
      "And then there’s Nottingham Forest, who are currently just some kind of insane f*ck-around-and-f*nd-out machine to the extent we’re not even sure regret has taken hold yet.",
      "",
      "There really is no other word for it. It’s the only word that adequately explains and conveys Nottingham Forest’s behaviour since about halfway through last season. This is a club that got dangerously high on the smell of their own farts and may now pay a ludicrously heavy price.",
      "They were very, very good at what they did last season under Nuno Espirito Santo. There was perhaps no other team in the league with a more clear-headed gameplan, delivered to consistent effect by a squad of players perfectly suited to the task.",
      "Even then, there were occasional glimpses. Occasional momentary lapses where Forest tried to be something different – something more? Something better? – than what had worked so well for them.",
      "There was one particular game against Newcastle, in which Forest had played their usual counter-attacking game to fine effect to lead 1-0 at half-time. Yet in the second they tried to play front-foot football that was not and is not their way and were picked off with ease by a grateful Newcastle, who ran out comfy 3-1 winners.",
      "That one match is now starting to look like a microcosm of these two seasons. The success in the first half has led them to a state of not-yet-earned giddiness and, yes, hubris.",
      "There is an arrogance for any club outside the cosseted elite to assume that their hard-won Premier League status is now entirely secure. The casual manner in which Forest allowed the Nuno situation to develop into an irreparable rift was extremely careless and far more risky than anyone from excitable owner down appeared to accept or even realise.",
      "And quite simply no Premier League team that is even dimly aware of the fact that relegation remains a theoretical possible fate would then bring Ange Postecoglou along into a season that has already begun, less still into a squad so unsuited to his wildly different methods.",
      "And no Premier League team thinking about anything but relegation is even looking at the Dyche button a few weeks later. That sound you can hear is a penny dropping far too late.",
      "A chaotic and potentially ruinous six-week misadventure that may now end with Forest right back with the sort of manager they had before, just a less good one. All while ensuring there is now absolutely no chance of Postecoglou’s undeniably entertaining nonsense ever featuring in Our League again. Cheers, lads.",
      "",
      "We’re not saying it was a bad idea to sign Alexander Isak or that he is anything other than a brilliant player. Even if someone mischievously puts that in the headline, which they might, the pricks.",
      "We’re just saying that signing Alexander Isak might not have been Liverpool’s best use of valuable time and resources as the final hours of the transfer window drained away.",
      "It is still very funny that by the time Liverpool actually got round to completing that Isak move they had already long before that signed Newcastle’s preferred replacement in Hugo Ekitike. But as more time passes, the more it looks like that joke is on Liverpool every bit as much as it was on Newcastle.",
      "Isak was the ultimate luxury signing. Not a player Liverpool needed, but one they could have. But by the time he came through the door Liverpool had already signed Ekitike and Florian Wirtz.",
      "Sure, Liverpool’s attack is stronger with Isak than without and it’s a long season with deep squads needed and all the rest.",
      "But by the time Liverpool were toing and froing to get that deal done it was far, far more necessary to perform some more prosaic but necessary remedial work in the defence.",
      "Sure, the extent of Ibrahima Konate’s struggles might have been hard to predict, but relying entirely on him and Virgil van Dijk – who is older than new Luton manager Jack Wilshere – was always a risk that didn’t need taking.",
      "Marc Guehi was right there. He was up for it, and so too were Palace until Liverpool turned such a fundamental transfer – Guehi wasn’t even a back-up, he’d have been straight in for Konate – into so much of an afterthought that Palace had no time left to get their own Guehi-less squad straight and thus pulled the plug.",
      "It is, obviously, not a straightforward either/or situation. Clubs can and obviously do work on multiple deals at once. But it’s hard to shake the notion that completing the more ostentatious and headline-grabbing deal left Liverpool with their eyes off the less exciting but more necessary prize. It’s a rare mis-step, but a potentially costly one.",

      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe continues to paint himself into a distinctly difficult corner over his at-all-costs backing of Ruben Amorim. Maybe he’s right. Maybe it will eventually all come good. But that looks a massive odds-against gamble right now.",
      "Ratcliffe has doubled-down harder than ever with his ‘three years’ daftness, a quote that has a small chance of becoming his ‘I always win something in my second season’ and a very, very high chance of either becoming yet another point of United ridicule or further hindrance to taking a necessary step.",
      "Almost impossible now to believe that anything more than the stubborn refusal of Ratcliffe and INEOS to accept the embarrassing fact of their own error is keeping Amorim in the job, and that really is just a double victory for silliness.",
      "Just own it. Face up to it. It’s not like Forest appointing Postecoglou, is it? It’s not like sacking Erik Ten Hag and appointing Amorim was an obvious mistake literally the world could see from a mile away. Really, the only quibble people could reasonably have with appointing Amorim when United appointed one of the most impressive young coaches in Europe was why had they dallied in the summer rather than make the change then?",
      "Nobody seriously imagined the Amorim Era would be this bad. Lots of people, and we’ll put ourselves in this camp, thought it might be really quite good.",
      "But it isn’t. It’s really sh*t. And the damage in sticking with Amorim is already being done. United have already lost Marcus Rashford for what will ultimately prove to be a pittance, so in thrall are they to Amorim and not wanting to be embarrassed. They might well lose Kobbie Mainoo next.",
      "And nothing in his record at the club suggests he’s worth it. And the comparisons with Mikel Arteta’s early years at Arsenal just don’t hold water. Arteta came under serious pressure and rightly so; he could very easily have been sacked. But he never had Arsenal in anything like the dire straits that have become the new normal at too-big-to-succeed Man United.",
      "",
      "Nottingham Forest’s loss may now prove West Ham’s gain, and at the very least you’d expect Nuno Espirito Santo to get the Hammers playing halfway competent and broadly effective football that keeps them away from relegation unpleasantness.",
      "But they had that. With David Moyes. And they didn’t want that anymore, because they wanted to aim higher and dream bigger. Which is absolutely fine. For what it’s worth, we once again thought similarly. It probably was time for Moyes to move on and West Ham to see what they might be able to do with a more progressive front-foot manager.",
      "But then they appointed Julen Lopetegui, who is the Spanish David Moyes.",
      "When that didn’t work they finally took a more West Ham approach and went for Graham Potter. And then gave him absolutely nothing of what he needed in the summer.",
      "Throughout the struggles in the final weeks and months of last season, it was clear that Potter could not be fairly judged until he’d had a pre-season to get his ideas across, and ideally a few players to help make that transition.",
      "Potter himself is far from blameless. He may well not have succeeded even if given the conditions to do so. But now we’ll never know, because West Ham didn’t just fail to do what was needed during the summer; for large parts of it they didn’t even particularly seem to be trying.",
      "",
      "It may only be slightly exaggerating things to say that Leeds’ entire season on their return to the Premier League may come to be defined by the period between Daniel Farke responding to a creditable 0-0 draw against Newcastle on August 30 by asking for two new attacking players, and the window closing with Leeds bringing in no new attacking players.",
      "The frustration is two-fold. First, because Farke’s request was not unreasonable. This was not a moon-on-a-stick request. He was asking for Harry Wilson and Manor Solomon, not Lamine Yamal and Vini Jr.",
      "Two, Farke’s Leeds had already by then shown proof of concept. They had shown against both Everton and Newcastle that they were capable enough defensively of mounting a serious bid for survival, but were hampered by attacking inadequacies that had seen them manage just one goal in three games – and that a penalty.",
      "While there have been more goals since the closing of the window, with six in their most four Premier League games, three of those came at Wolves. And right now we’re inclined to consider those as roughly as irrelevant to any assessment of Leeds’ long-term survival prospects as conceding five goals at Arsenal.",
      "Leeds definitely still have a decent shot at staying up in a league that offers more opportunity to do so for a competent promoted team than at any other time in the last few years. But it really wouldn’t have taken a lot of activity in those last few days to make that decent shot a truly compelling one.",
      "",
      "We’ve already stretched the concept of ‘this season’ right back to include the entirety of the transfer window that precedes it, and that feels like it’s absolutely fair enough. The transfer window is surely part of the season that follows it far more than it is part of the season that preceded it.",
      "It is upon that following season that its influence is felt. But can we really claim things that happened in May during last season as being this season’s regrets and/or f*ck-ups.",
      "When it comes to Wolves, we’re saying yes. Yes we can. Our reasons are these.",
      "First of all, May is very much a month when cricket is played and is therefore summer. That’s just basic. Second, that very deliberate phrase we used just now about the transfer window: it is upon that following season that its influence is felt.",
      "And that’s exactly how we feel about the last four matches of Wolves’ 24/25 season. They meant absolutely nothing to 2024/25, Wolves having already secured survival with something to spare by winning six games in a row through March and April.",
      "But their influence on 25/26 already feels far more significant. Because this is very familiar Wolves territory: a bad end to one season bleeding into a bad start to the next.",
      "That winning run – albeit against three terrible relegated sides and the other three most ridiculous and feeble Premier League teams at that time in West Ham, Spurs and Man United – offered Wolves the chance to avoid that familiar end-of-season sinking feeling.",
      "They weren’t easy games in that final four, but we’re not asking for them to make that winning run 10 games or anything. Lose to Man City by all means if you really must, but even just a home win against either Brighton or Brentford would have taken Wolves into summer with some wind in their sails.",
      "It might not have been enough. The loss of key players would still have been keenly felt, but the bleak nature of their start, one that leaves them now as the only Premier League team still without a win having declined a Dr Tottenham prescription at the last moment, would have felt far less inevitably self-fulfilling.",
      "",
      "Breaking our own rules a bit here by treating Chelsea as a club where regrets and f*ck-ups are measured in the same way by the same metrics as football clubs, rather than what Chelsea now are.",
      "When correctly treated as a football player trading company, selling Noni Madueke made a fair chunk of sense. He was far from indispensable and even Arsenal’s fans didn’t particularly want him at the time.",
      "But Chelsea have often looked a weary side since their Club World Cup win and, with several attacking players currently underperforming and relying more and more on the increased goal contributions of Moises Caicedo, it might have been nice to keep Madueke around the place.",
      "And that’s before even considering the whole ‘strengthening a direct rival’ angle, one that allowed Arsenal to achieve what was previously thought impossible: suffer a minor Bukayo Saka injury setback without doom-laden proclamations about the sky falling in from long-suffering fans of the only club to ever suffer injuries.",
      "",
      "Not going badly for Spurs at all, really, all things considered, and this one is definitely far more in the ‘slightly irritating’ category than a lot of others on the list.",
      "They did some tidy transfer work in the end this summer, albeit with a couple of cartoonish bits of Spursy slapstick along the way, and so far the idea of replacing Ange Postecoglou’s ludicrous football with Thomas Frank’s not ludicrous football is proving an effective if not always necessarily exhilarating decision.",
      "Where Tottenham might have slightly missed the boat is behind the scenes. In hindsight, we perhaps should have seen Daniel Levy’s departure coming. There was a clear sense this summer of a man attempting to cement his legacy, most notably when even agreeing to sit down for a chat with dangerous far-left Commie firebrand Gary Neville.",
      "But he didn’t actually leave until after the transfer window. And the Lewis Family’s new-found interest in the day-to-day running of Spurs and injection of £100m of fresh capital has also come now specifically at a time when it cannot actually be used to better the on-field situation.",
      "And this is suddenly a season ripe with opportunities for Spurs. Arsenal look too good but are still Arsenal; Chelsea, Liverpool and Man City all look more vulnerable to some extent or other than had been expected, Manchester United are still in full clown-car more, Nottingham Forest have collapsed in on themselves, while neither Aston Villa nor Newcastle appear in quite as good a position to challenge as in the recent past.",
      "The margins between success (i.e. getting back in the Champions League) and failure (not doing that) are likely to be very tight again this season. A chairman who hadn’t actively antagonised every other club in the division and an extra £100m to throw around really might have meant more in August than it does in October. Or even January when it may be too late and, of course, Value Is Hard To Come By.",

      "It feels like Villa spent the entire summer in something of a funk on the back of missing out on Champions League football in the manner that they did and the knock-on effect that had on what they could do and who they could bring in during the summer.",
      "The good news is that there really is a very good chance that, like with Spurs last season, it all ends up working out for the best and they get back in the Champions League anyway with a lovely shiny European trophy ending an uncomfortably long drought.",
      "But right now, despite a four-game winning run that has lifted the gloom and funk to a decent extent, it does look rather more likely that something is ending rather than beginning at Villa, that they will now slink back having so nearly but not quite muscled their way right in to England and thus Europe’s top table.",
      "",
      "Not entirely or even mainly their fault, but Newcastle’s summer was an awkward, distracting and distracted one. In a league where standing still is rarely good enough, theirs was a summer spent inevitably and uncomfortably trying to avoid tumbling backwards.",
      "The uncertainty – or perhaps the long, painfully drawn-out certainty – around Alexander Isak’s departure didn’t help make it any easier for Newcastle to identify and secure a replacement, with those potentially coming in understandably keen to know exactly where they might stand before committing to the club.",
      "They do seem to have just about got there in the end with Nick Woltemade, even if it they had to pay a hefty premium to avoid the catastrophe of bringing in no replacement striker whatsoever. The big German absolutely screams cult hero, but it’s an awful lot to ask for him to come anywhere close to replacing what Isak gave them, and Newcastle weren’t able to even attempt the always entertaining if not perhaps reliably successful ‘Sell Elvis and buy The Beatles’ approach.",

Or is there a mystery third option involving a sort of consortium which ‘can generate billions for the club’ and idolise Ousmane Dembele?",
      "It feels like a good time for a little Q&A session to try and shed some light on precisely what is going on.",
      "Certainly not ostensibly. Ratcliffe’s INEOS only completed the purchase of a 27.7% stake in the club in February 2024 for £1.25billion, increasing that stake to 28.9% in December 2024 when the last payment of a further £238m financial injection to boost the club’s infrastructure was made.",
      "That grants INEOS Limited – owned by Ratcliffe, Andy Currie and Manchester United board director John Reece – 28.9% of outstanding shares and voting rights, plus control over footballing operations, which has been exercised flagrantly and is unlikely to be relinquished soon or easily.",
      "Ratcliffe recently pledged to honour the entirety of Ruben Amorim’s three-year contract; those were not the words, nor have these been the actions, of a man who wishes to sell.",
      "Members of the Glazer family still control 48.9% of total outstanding shares altogether, with 67.9% of voting rights split between the six American siblings.",
      "The Glazers and INEOS are, as the club’s official website puts it, the only ‘two entities [who] hold greater than 10% of the voting rights in Manchester United plc’.",
      "While the changes to that ownership structure have not delivered the success INEOS will have craved or the Glazers perhaps expected, it is vanishingly unlikely either party will want to release their shares and offers are hardly being encouraged either way.",
      "It boils down to a couple of quotes chucked into the void of an international break.",
      "Turki Al-Sheikh, the chairman of the General Entertainment Authority, a government department charged with developing the entertainment sector in Saudi Arabia, sparked the furore by posting on X:",
      "‘The best news I heard today is that Manchester United is now in an advanced stage of completing a deal to sell to a new investor. I hope he’s better than the previous owners.’",
      "He later clarified that he was ‘not the investor, nor are they from my nation’, and the reported deal ‘might not necessarily happen’ anyway.",
      "Then a few days later a familiar name cropped up again in the news cycle: Thomas Zilliacus was back to take any seat at the top table he could find.",
      "Having spent an uncomfortable amount of 2023 arguing with a fellow Manchester United bidder who Ratcliffe later suggested “nobody’s ever seen” and might not actually even “exist”, Zilliacus capitalised on the unexpected commotion to bring his ideas into the equation again.",
      "The Finnish former Nokia head and XXI Century Capital founder teased “joining forces with the right parties with the sole aim of bringing Manchester United back to where it should be as the number one club in the world”.",
      "He felt “the opportunity is still there” to invest, aimed another fan-friendly dig at the Glazers for “not doing what should be done”, said he would “have nothing against working with people like Jim Ratcliffe or any investor, whoever that may be”.",
      "Zilliacus also confessed his love for players like Ballon d’Or winner Ousmane Dembele while saying he would “never have brought a player like Neymar to Manchester United” in a definite blast at Ed Woodward.",
      "It was then claimed on Monday that a ‘United Arab Emirates-based consortium’ was ‘meeting Manchester United officials in London’.",
      "Manchester United have thus far dismissed the rumours privately to sources when asked; it does seem to be that there actually is a lot of smoke without fire here.",
      "It is impossible to know their intentions but there has been no indication that the Glazers are willing to sell any more of their shares.",
      "There is, however, some interesting fine print contained within the INEOS purchase of a minority stake which remains relevant.",
      "As part of that deal was a ‘drag-along rights’ clause which was scheduled to become active 18 months after the initial investment, lasting until February 2027. The mechanism came into effect in August.",
      "In short, it makes the full sale of a company theoretically easier by preventing a minority shareholder from blocking any deal those who hold the majority want to go through. In this case it means that if the Glazers found someone willing to buy 100% of the shares in Manchester United, Ratcliffe would be forced to sell his stake in the deal.",
      "If that deal is made before February 2027, the share price must be above the $33 Ratcliffe paid. After that, it can be lower.",
      "INEOS also had first refusal on any shares the Glazers wanted to sell, although that expired without needing to be activated in August.",
      "There is a belief within the club that the Glazers are more than happy with the ownership situation, providing as it does a useful lightning rod for criticism in INEOS and Ratcliffe while allowing them to maintain overarching control of an incredibly lucrative investment.",
      "There is one bidder conspicuous by his absence in the current speculation: Sheikh Jassim Bin Hamad Al Thani.",
      "His takeover bid failed in 2023 when he attempted to buy 100% of shares in Manchester United for £4.79bn but repeatedly failed to provide proof of funds.",
      "Chris Wheeler of the Daily Mail has suggested that while Jassim ‘has kept an eye on developments and is aware of the clause, there is ‘zero interest’ in acting upon it’.",
      "A few reasons are cited: Qatar’s desire to focus on other projects such as securing the 2036 Olympics; the success PSG have had making buying another club ‘less attractive because someone else has already been there and done it in Europe’; and the media doubt his interest drew – Jassim was said to have sent ‘legal letters’ to Manchester United and Ratcliffe at the time.",
      "The belief is that Jassim has ‘moved on’ but the Middle East would not be short of prospective buyers if given enough encouragement.",
      "If Manchester United were sold now at the $33-per-share minimum that Ratcliffe is legally entitled to, that would give the club a current valuation of £4.3bn – making them the most expensive football club ever sold.",
      "Finance expert Kieran Maguire believes it would cost even more, telling SPORTbible recently: “Manchester United are a premium brand, a complete buyout would be at least £5bn but then a significant spend would be required on and off the pitch.",
      "“Current stock market value is about £3bn which is 15 per cent lower than at the end of June, despite all the rumours circulating [around] the club, which suggests the market is sceptical about whether a full blown bid is likely.”",
      "If this absolute mess is worth at least £5bn, you can certainly see why there is more of a greater appetite to sort the myriad issues rather than sell up.",
      "Harry Kane, Kylian Mbappe and Erling Haaland are currently locked in an absurd goalscoring race, but how have they all simultaneously reached their peak?",
      "The FFP verdict is imminent and if Man City are relegated their players need to be reassigned. You’re welcome, Sheikh Mansour.",
      "Are Harry Kane and Bukayo Saka not ‘special’ enough to get the credit they deserve? And is Roy Keane right about Djed Spence?",
      "Jude Bellingham is an obvious point of interest in the latest England Ladder, but Thomas Tuchel’s willingness to walk the walk provides useful clarity elsewhere.",
      "With one sentence, Roy Keane proved that he is basing his opinion on Djed Spence on something other than actually watching him play.",
      "It is literally impossible for the England ‘focus’ to be on anything other than the fan ‘backlash’ at Thomas Tuchel even after qualifying for the World Cup."

      "Thursday 16 October 2025 08:03, UK",
      "Our football betting expert and top tipster Jones Knows provides his insight across the Premier League and sees value in backing Man Utd at Liverpool.",
      "Ange Postecoglou's arrival at Nottingham Forest came with big promises of high tempo, pressing and attacking football but so far what we've seen is a defence creaking under the pressure of playing Postecoglou's style. Forest are leaking goals at a rate of 2.1 per 90 minutes since the Aussie took charge.",
      "So my eyes are drawn to the anytime goalscorer market for Chelsea. Enter Alejandro Garnacho at 9/4 with Sky Bet.",
      "Chelsea under Enzo Maresca are looking to use wide players more than Garnacho was utilised at Manchester United - here, he can stretch defences and find more one-vs-one opportunities. Garnacho has already shown glimpses in his early appearances that he could be the next player to flourish away from the Old Trafford spotlight.",
      "Given the defensive issues at Forest and Garnacho's knack for getting in the right place at the right time, he looks great value to score with Sky Bet in a game that should sail past the over 2.5 goals line.",
      "Being ahead of a curve is the name of the game when trying to consistently beat the market. And betting against Brighton before it becomes trendy to do so is very much a tactic on my radar.",
      "Yes, they are still getting results. But scratch beneath the surface with both the eye test and the underlying metrics and this is a team that isn't functioning anywhere near the levels the market seems to think they are. Brighton's defensive numbers are the biggest worry. They've conceded an average of 1.5 expected goals per game over the last 14 Premier League matches - that's the worst per-90 figure of any ever-present team during that period.",
      "Their pressing structure, once so cohesive and suffocating, is now easier to play through - and their high-risk, high-reward build-up play is not seeing the returns it once did. They have kept just one clean sheet in their last 19 Premier League games, too.",
      "The fact we can get a team as reliable and dangerous as Newcastle at 10/11 on the draw no bet makes this best-bet-of-the-weekend material.",
      "Every so often in the Premier League, a fixture becomes more than just three points. There's six points on offer here.",
      "Both clubs know a win shifts momentum, belief and in many cases season trajectories. And these 'six-pointers' very often produce open, high-intensity, attacking football - something which isn't portrayed by the market.",
      "The last 33 'six pointers' in the Premier League - a subjective definition of the fixture - has seen an average of 2.8 goals scored. When assessing the odds, the 6/5 being dangled by Sky Bet on over 2.5 goals being scored is hard to resist.",
      "Both sides have quietly made a habit of turning this fixture into a cure for insomnia. The last nine meetings between the two have all landed for under 2.5 goals backers with just a measly total of 10 goals scored in those nine meetings.",
      "And Palace are fast becoming a friend of the under-goals backer with Oliver Glasner building such a watertight defensive unit. Across their last 17 games in all competitions the average match goals sits at just 1.85 per 90.",
      "The market hasn't quite caught up with just how consistently dull this fixture has been. Under 2.5 goals should be shorter than it is at 10/11 with Sky Bet and represents the best angle into what looks set to be a tight, cagey contest.",
      "Jake O'Brien vs Jeremy Doku is shaping up to be a mismatch and one punters should be looking to profit from.",
      "If O'Brien emerges from this duel with clean shorts, his shoes on the right feet and a clean sheet, I'll tip my betting cap to him. But I'd rather side with reality and back him to get carded at 7/2 with Sky Bet, a price that screams value.",
      "Doku isn't just a livewire, he's a walking yellow card generator. The Belgian winger has been fouled 2.43 times per 90 in the Premier League this season and he is the reason why opposition right-backs and right centre-backs have picked up a card in six of City's seven games he's featured in.",
      "The numbers and the eye test both agree: Wolves are far better than their results suggest.",
      "There's a case to be made that Vitor Pereria's team have far more in the tank than the league table currently shows.",
      "Wolves have taken just two points from seven games but the expected points, based on their underlying metrics provided by Opta, show they should have seven points in the bag.",
      "That type of gulf usually evens itself out across a season and it is something to profit from.",
      "The chances are being created in attack and restricted to a good level in defence, so it's just the finishing touch of the Wolves strikers and very efficient finishing of opposition strikers that has been costing them in what is a fine-margin sport. When a little bit of regression to the mean kicks in, results will follow.",
      "Starting here, where they are 21/10 with Sky Bet for the away win.",
      "Arsenal have only conceded three goals in 10 games in all competitions - they are shipping the fewest goals per game of any team in Europe's major leagues. We shouldn't be surprised though as Mikel Arteta has been overseeing what has been one of the best defensive teams we've ever seen in the Premier League for three seasons now.",
      "That's why backing them to win matches along with the under 3.5 goals angle thrown into the mix at a juicier price is the smart way to boost Arsenal's outright win price here from 1/2 to 6/5 with Sky Bet.",
      "They dominate territory, limit chaos and once they get their noses in front, they manage games like a team with title-winning maturity. Across their last 18 wins in all competitions, 16 have landed for punters who have added the under 3.5 goal line into the equation. It should land again.",
      "The international break can be a problem for some managers - not Unai Emery.",
      "Aston Villa are unbeaten in the last 10 Premier League games after an international break, winning eight. Whatever Emery does in this fiddly time for managers is working wonders.",
      "Meanwhile, Spurs' encouraging start to life under Thomas Frank has been somewhat undermined by a pair of disappointing results in their last two Premier League home games after being battered by Bournemouth and only drawing with Wolves courtesy of a last-minute equaliser. It means Spurs have won just three of their 17 Premier League home games since November last year.",
      "Villa are an obvious play on the draw no bet at 11/8 with Sky Bet.",
      "The markets haven't quite woken up to just how sharp Amad Diallo has looked recently, nor how well he's linking up with Bryan Mbeumo, who's become his perfect foil in United's new-look attack.",
      "There's a real chemistry brewing here.",
      "Amad and Mbeumo might not have been the attacking duo many expected to define this United side, but their movement and understanding has been electric and could just be the catalyst for Ruben Amorim.",
      "At 9/2 to score with Sky Bet, the value's there on Amad.",
      "And against a Liverpool side that's been anything but watertight down their left flank, this looks the perfect storm for the United hotshot to make a big statement.",
      "Liverpool will, as always, dominate territory and possession but that only increases the space Amad can exploit on the counter. Pair that with his on-field connection with Mbeumo and United have the tools to create more problems for Liverpool, who do look short at 4/7 with Sky Bet for maximum points.",
      "West Ham are in 'season-defining' territory already.",
      "The Hammers are winless in eight home Premier League games, a run that played a huge part in Graham Potter losing his job. It's their longest winless run since moving to the London Stadium and, in its current miserable guise, the place feels a world away from Upton Park.",
      "When you're knee-deep in a relegation scrap, you don't need talk of 'underlying numbers' - you need street-fighting survival football. Nuno Espirito Santo brings exactly that.",
      "Call it what you want - reactive, pragmatic and at times boring - but it's effective when backs are against the wall. West Ham need points and Nuno will bag them plenty based on his body of work. The home win looks the call here at 29/20 with Sky Bet.",

      "Cristiano Ronaldo is on track to reach an unprecedented scoring milestone but when he could hit his 1,000th goal? Between the Lines returns for a bonus edition to break down the numbers.",
      "Ronaldo set yet another scoring record when he became the outright top scorer in World Cup qualifying history with his double in Portugal's 2-2 draw against Hungary on Tuesday night.",
      "The goals put him on 41 from 51 World Cup qualifying games, moving him clear of the previous record-holder, former Guatemala striker Carlos Ruiz on 39, with Lionel Messi third in the list on 36.",
      "Ronaldo has now scored a record 143 goals in 225 games for his country in addition to 805 in 1,068 games at club level, putting him on a staggering combined total of 948 career goals.",
      "Ronaldo turned 40 in February but he continues to rack up impressive numbers at club level as well as internationally, albeit against weaker opposition in Saudi Arabia, where he has scored 104 goals in 117 appearances across four seasons with Al-Nassr.",
      "With 32 goals already for club and country in 2025, he is maintaining a remarkably consistent level of productivity in front of goal. Ronaldo has averaged more than 50 goals per calendar year since 2010.",
      "His highest scoring year came in 2013, when he smashed 69 goals and won the Ballon d'Or. Amazingly, his total has only dipped below 39 goals once in a calendar year in the last decade and a half.",
      "It seems there's a lot more to come from him too.",
      "With Portugal set to qualify for next summer's World Cup, and with two years to go on his Al-Nassr contract, Ronaldo is projected to become the first player in recorded history to reach the 1,000-goal mark in October 2026 based on his current scoring rate.",
      "Ronaldo's opening goal against Hungary was his 181st with his weaker left foot. His second was his 608th with his right.",
      "His double demonstrated his all-round threat attacking threat and Ronaldo is of course similarly dangerous aerially, with 157 of his goals, roughly 17 per cent, having come with his head.",
      "His goals have been split relatively evenly between home and away and neutral venues. His tally includes 178 penalties but he has also scored 135 times from outside the box, including 64 direct free-kicks.",
      "By competition, the biggest share of his goals has come in LaLiga, where he scored 311 times across nine seasons with Real Madrid.",
      "He remains the top scorer in Champions League history with 140 goals and also found the net 103 times across two spells in the Premier League with Manchester United.",
      "His favourite opponents, in terms of which sides he has scored the most goals against, are all based in Spain, with Sevilla, in particular, grateful to have seen the back of him.",

      "Wednesday 15 October 2025 12:56, UK",
      "Which top performers are flying under the radar in the Premier League so far this season? We pick an Unsung Heroes XI...",
      "Henderson has been an integral part of Crystal Palace's recent club-record unbeaten run. The 28-year-old shot stopper started 18 of Palace's 19 unbeaten games between April and October and this season has kept six clean sheets in 11 appearances - no other Premier League goalkeeper has kept more clean sheets in all competitions this season.",
      "Henderson also boasts the best figures so far in the Premier League this season for xG prevented - he has conceded five Premier League goals this season despite being expected to have conceded almost eight goals.",
      "Signed permanently from Fiorentina this summer for £14m, Kayode has been one of Brentford's best attacking outlets this season. The 21-year-old Italian has started all of the Bees' seven Premier League games - either at right-back or right wing-back - and currently tops the charts for most successful dribbles of all Premier League defenders this season.",
      "He also ranks third of all defenders in the top flight this season for most passes played into the box (38) and fifth for most sprints (131).",
      "Senesi has been one of Bournemouth's key performers this season. He has been part of a well-marshalled defence which has helped steer his side to a club-record start to the season, with the Cherries winning 14 points from their opening seven Premier League games. The 28-year-old Argentine has started all of these games.",
      "His tenacity this season brings up a statistic that no other player in the division has made more clearances and interceptions combined than Senesi.",
      "Tarkowski has been very much Mr Reliable at the back in recent seasons for Everton. The 32-year-old has been ever-present for the Toffees in the Premier League this term and has helped them up into eighth position in the table - this time last season they were lying 16th.",
      "Tarkowski's strength is winning the ball for his team - of all Premier League defenders this season, only Patrick Dorgu has won more duels than the Englishman and only Virgil van Dijk has won more aerial duels.",
      "Mitchell has been another one of Palace's reliable constants in recent seasons with the 26-year-old having started 66 of Palace's last 67 Premier League games. It could be argued that he has been unlucky not to have added to his two England caps - the last of which came in 2022 - especially when you see that no player has won more tackles than him in the Premier League this season.",
      "He has also been productive offensively, whipping in seven successful open play crosses, the only defender with more this season is Wolves' Hugo Bueno.",
      "It seems the £29m paid by Everton for Dewsbury-Hall could be a shrewd piece of business. The 27-year-old started Everton's opening six Premier League games this season which was his best run of top-flight starts for two-and-a-half years. He started only two Premier League games for Chelsea in all of last season.",
      "When comparing his time so far at Everton to his previous four Premier League seasons for Leicester and Chelsea, we can see his passing accuracy has improved and he is creating more chances. His four chances created in the 2-0 win vs Brighton in August was the most he had made in a Premier League match since a game for Leicester in February 2023.",
      "Stach arrived from Hoffenheim for £17.4m this summer and the 26-year-old German hasn't looked back since. The 6ft 4in midfielder has started all seven of Leeds' Premier League games so far and has already recorded a goal and an assist - both coming in the 3-1 win at Wolves last month.",
      "His all-action game is backed up by the fact that only Elliot Anderson has covered more ground in the Premier League than Stach this season and only Bruno Fernandes and Jack Grealish have created more chances than the German.",
      "Ndiaye has been another one of Everton's bright sparks this season, the 25-year-old is the club's top scorer this season with three Premier League goals and, going further back, has nine goals in his last 18 league starts since January.",
      "The Senegalese attacker boasts a 50 per cent shot conversion rate this season, scoring from half of his six shots taken. No Everton player has shown more desire to win the ball back or to take a player on as the stats suggest.",
      "Minteh has arguably been Brighton's best player this season, the 21-year-old Gambian - signed from Newcastle for £30m in the summer of 2024 - has been an ever-present in the league and has recorded either a goal or an assist in three of Brighton's last four Premier League games.",
      "He currently ranks in the top two of all Premier League players this season for sprints (only Adrien Truffert more), touches in the opposition box (currently top with Jack Grealish) and successful take-ons (only Mohammed Kudus more).",
      "Anthony has made a blistering start to the season, having been involved in five of Burnley's seven Premier League goals scored so far. With four goals and an assist, only Erling Haaland and Antoine Semenyo have scored more goals this term. He has, in fact, scored four goals in his last six Premier League appearances, having scored just three in his previous 34.",
      "The 25-year-old - signed for just £8m from Bournemouth this summer - has outperformed his xG by +1.8 this season which is the fourth best record in the Premier League. Another standout stat is that the only Englishman to have scored more league goals than Anthony in Europe's major Leagues this season is Harry Kane.",
      "Brentford's No 9 has made an impressive start to the season having scored five goals in his eight appearances, including four Premier League goals - his first in the competition. Last season his campaign was disrupted with two knee injuries which is why the 24-year-old Brazilian made only one Premier League start for the Bees last term.",
      "Two of his four Premier League goals came inside the first 20 minutes in the 3-1 win vs Man Utd in late September - only Bryan Mbeumo and Ivan Toney have scored more goals across Brentford's first six games of a Premier League season.",

      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe mentioned Arsenal's faith in Mikel Arteta when saying he would like to give Ruben Amorim three years at Man Utd, but how does his record in his first 50 games in charge compare? Have your say in our poll",
      "Thursday 9 October 2025 13:10, UK",
      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe has cited Mikel Arteta's \"miserable\" start as Arsenal boss as a reason to have patience with Manchester United's under-fire head coach Ruben Amorim. But how do their first 50 games in charge really compare?",
      "\"Ruben needs to demonstrate he is a great coach over three years,\" the Manchester United minority owner told The Business podcast. \"Football is not overnight. It's three years. You also look at Arteta. He had a miserable time over the first couple of years.\"",
      "Arteta has gone on to justify the club's faith by turning Arsenal into consistent Premier League title challengers. But does Amorim have Manchester United on the same path to long-term success? And what do their records after 50 games in charge tell us?",
      "While Arsenal were a long way below their current level in Arteta's first 50 games between December 2019 and April 2021, their record was much better than that of Amorim's Manchester United.",
      "Arteta won 27 of his first 50 games compared to Amorim's 19, giving him a win rate of 54 per cent to Amorim's 38 per cent. Arteta lost 13 games to Amorim's 19, drawing 12 to Amorim's 10.",
      "The goals scored columns are nearly identical, with Arsenal scoring 79 times to Manchester United's 78 under Amorim. But there is a big difference in goals conceded, with Amorim's side having let in nearly 60 per cent more than Arsenal, on 76.",
      "Arsenal kept 18 clean sheets in Arteta's first 50 games, hinting at his capacity to make the side more difficult to beat. Manchester United, by contrast, have only managed eight shut-outs under Amorim. They have conceded three or more goals on nine occasions, something that only happened three times in Arteta's first 50 games at Arsenal.",
      "Arteta inherited a team sitting 10th in the Premier League when he took the Arsenal job in December 2019. Manchester United were lower, in 14th, when Amorim took over at Manchester United.",
      "Arteta oversaw slight improvement relative to his starting position, although Arsenal's eighth-placed finish at the end of his first campaign, which included the interruption of the Covid pandemic, was the club's lowest since coming 10th in 1992/93.",
      "Manchester United finished even lower than the position in which Amorim found them at the end of his first season, coming 15th in a record-low for the club, with a points total of 42 to Arsenal's 56 in Arsenal's first season under Arteta.",
      "Both managers reached cup finals at the end of their first seasons. But while Arteta guided Arsenal to FA Cup success, beating Chelsea in the final having overcome Manchester City in the last four, Amorim suffered Europa League disappointment against Spurs.",
      "Arteta was unable to improve on Arsenal's eighth-placed finish in his first full season in charge, with Arsenal ending up in the same spot in the table. They were ninth at the time of his 50th game, a 3-0 loss to Liverpool at the Emirates Stadium in April 2021, only a place higher than Manchester United's position at Amorim's half-century.",
      "Arteta showed pragmatism in winning the FA Cup, moving away from his favoured 4-2-3-1, which has subsequently evolved into a 4-3-3, and instead using a back three, a change he said was intended to make the most of the players at his disposal at that time.",
      "Amorim has taken a more rigid approach, sticking to his favoured 3-4-2-1, despite external pressure to adapt his system. While Arteta showed variation in his starting formations in his first 50 games, Amorim has used a back three consistently, the only variation from 3-4-2-1 being 3-4-3, which he has used five times.",
      "Bukayo Saka is the only player from Arteta's first Arsenal line-up still at the club this season. The England international was used as a left-back in their 1-1 draw with Bournemouth on Boxing Day in 2019.",
      "There has been turnover at Manchester United under Amorim too, albeit in a shorter time frame, with five players who started the 1-1 draw with Ipswich in his first game in November of last year having gone, either on loan or permanently, in Andre Onana, Jonny Evans, Christian Eriksen, Alejandro Garnacho and Marcus Rashford.",
      "The pace of change was relatively slow initially for Arteta at Arsenal, although he was able to include Gabriel Magalhaes, Martin Odegaard and Thomas Partey in his team for the defeat to Liverpool at the Emirates Stadium in his 50th game.",
      "Amorim enjoyed a win to mark his half-century as Manchester United beat Sunderland 2-0 last weekend with a starting line-up which included three new signings.",
      "Arsenal's transfer spending has ramped up in recent years, culminating in this summer's record £257m spend. But the club's outlay was more modest over the course of Arteta's first 50 games.",
      "Arteta mostly had to rely on loan signings and free transfers, with spending totalling only £81.5m across two transfer windows. Partey and Gabriel were the only players signed for significant fees.",
      "Manchester United have brought in fewer players under Amorim but spent considerably more in transfer fees, with Benjamin Sesko, Bryan Mbeumo, Matheus Cunha, Senne Lemmens, Diego Leon and Ayden Heaven arriving for a combined £232.4m, dwarfing Arsenal's figure in Arteta's first two transfer windows.",
      "As for sales, Arsenal only received a fee for one player during Arteta's first 50 games, with Emiliano Martinez sold to Aston Villa for £17m.",
      "Manchester United have been more successful on that front, recouping £61.7m from the sales of Garnacho and Antony.",
      "Have your say on which manager has done a better job in his first 50 games in charge in the poll below.",
      "Let us know whether you think Amorim will come good long-term.",

      "Thursday 9 October 2025 07:24, UK",
      "Manchester United minority owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe has said he wants to give under-pressure head coach Ruben Amorim three years in the job to prove himself.",
      "Amorim is approaching the first anniversary of his appointment at Old Trafford, but his position has been under constant scrutiny since he took over on November 1 last year.",
      "He has failed to record back-to-back Premier League wins during that time, coming 15th last season - their worst top-flight finish since 1974 - and things have not improved much since the summer as United were knocked out of the Carabao Cup by League Two Grimsby in August.",
      "That has led to suggestions Amorim's job is under threat, but Ratcliffe said the 40-year-old is a \"good guy\" and has time to turn things around.",
      "\"Ruben needs to demonstrate he is a great coach over three years,\" he told The Business podcast, produced by The Times and The Sunday Times.",
      "Asked if Amorim is going to get three years, Ratcliffe replied: \"Yes. That is where I would be. Three years. Because football is not overnight.",
      "\"It's three years. You also look at [Mikel] Arteta at Arsenal. He had a miserable time over the first couple of years.",
      "\"We have to be patient. We have a long-term plan. It isn't a light switch.",
      "\"You can't run a club like Manchester United on knee-jerk reactions to some journalist who goes off on one every week.\"",
      "Ratcliffe has owned just under 30 per cent of United through his chemicals company INEOS since February 2024, taking over control of football operations at the club.",
      "That still left the Glazer family, who have been the subject of numerous fan protests over their handling of the club since taking over in 2005, in overall charge.",
      "Asked what would happen if the Glazers told him to sack Amorim, Ratcliffe said: \"It's not going to happen.\"",
      "The INEOS boss added the Glazers were happy for him to take charge, adding: \"That probably sums it up. We're local and they're the other side of the pond.",
      "\"That's a long way away to try and manage a football club as big and complex as Manchester United. We're here with feet on the ground.",
      "\"They [the Glazers] get a bad rap... but they are really nice people and they are really passionate about the club.\"",
      "Ratcliffe has come in for criticism of his own after controversial cuts designed to drive down costs saw around 450 jobs axed and the removal of perks like subsidised staff lunches.",
      "\"The costs were just too high. There are some fantastic people at Manchester United, but there was also a level of mediocrity and it had become bloated,\" he said.",
      "\"I got a lot of flak for the free lunches, but no one's ever given me a free lunch.",
      "\"The biggest correlation, like it or not, between results and any external factor - is profitability. The more cash you have got, the better squad you can build.",
      "\"So a lot of what we have done in the first year is spend an awful lot of time putting the club on a sustainable, healthy footing.",
      "\"We're not seeing all the benefits of the restructuring that we've done in this set of (financial) results (United last month reported record revenues of £666.5million for last season but a loss of £33million for the financial year) and we were not in the Champions League.",
      "\"Those numbers will get better. Manchester United will become the most profitable football club in the world, in my view, and from that will stem, I hope, a long-term, sustainable, high-level of football.\"",
      "Ratcliffe says he wants to give his first managerial appointment at Old Trafford three years to prove himself as a \"great coach\" and that patience extends to the players.",
      "United's director of football Jason Wilcox has canvassed the opinion of some of the United players - as he would in normal conversations around the training ground - and the consensus is that the squad are happy with Amorim.",

      "\"What happens if they lose all those games? There will be another international break. Everybody will be talking about Ruben Amorim's future again.",
      "\"This is a very significant intervention by Jim Ratcliffe to come out and back Ruben Amorim. I personally think the backing is not 100 per cent. If you actually look at the quotes, he's not coming out and saying come what may, Ruben Amorim is not leaving. He will be the head coach for the next three years.",
      "\"He's just saying 'Ruben needs to demonstrate he's a great coach over three years'. 'We have to be patient'. 'We have a long-term plan'. 'It isn't a light switch'.",
