      "Sandro Tonali could leave Newcastle in the summer(Image: UEFA via Getty Images)",
      "Sandro Tonali is weighing up a departure from Newcastle United this summer in pursuit of Champions League football next season. The midfielder has been associated with Manchester United in recent days as the club plans to strengthen its midfield.",
      "United are believed to be making a fresh central midfielder a priority for the 2026/27 campaign after choosing not to invest during the previous two windows. Elliot Anderson, Carlos Baleba and Adam Wharton have all been mentioned, though Tonali represents the most recent name under consideration.",
      "The Telegraph has reported that the 25-year-old is anticipated to feature prominently in a transfer saga during the summer. United are already confirmed to lose one midfielder when Casemiro departs and are projected to spend substantially on his successor.",
      "Newcastle secured Tonali for £55million in 2023 and with the likes of Enzo Fernandez, Moises Caicedo and Declan Rice commanding fees exceeding £100m, the Magpies are well positioned to demand a premium price. On deadline day, certain reports indicated that the Italian midfielder had been proposed to Arsenal.",
      "The Gunners opted against pursuing a deal, though that has raised questions about his future on Tyneside. According to Tonali's representative, Giuseppe Riso, his departure from Eddie Howe's squad remains possible at the season's conclusion.",
      "\"Newcastle are having a hard time of letting go of Sandro, and he wants to lead the club to the Champions League,\" he told Sky Italy. \"We'll evaluate and decide what to do in the summer. These transfer discussions will take place later. We'll see how the season ends and then we'll decide what to do. There's no preference at the moment.",
      "Sandro Tonali is on Manchester United's transfer radar(Image: Newcastle United via Getty Image)",
      "\"It's still early. What we're saying today won't apply tomorrow. Newcastle couldn't let him go now, and there's no point in moving, especially since Sandro is very attached to the club.\"",
      "United's prospects of tempting Tonali to Old Trafford will be substantially boosted if Newcastle fails to salvage their campaign. Howe's side are presently 12th in the Premier League standings following erratic form, meaning their strongest hope of returning to the competition may depend on them winning the tournament this season.",
      "\"I don't think so, but lots of things happen without my knowledge,\" Howe responded when questioned if the rumours surrounding Tonali's future would disturb the midfielder. \"As far as I'm aware, we've got player who is an outstanding footballer, an outstanding person.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UTD FB PAGE! Latest United news and more on our dedicated Facebook page",
      "\"He's very happy here, he's got a great relationship with me, his teammates, and seems really happy within himself. That would surprise me [if Tonali became unsettled], but our best players will always attract glances from other clubs - that's just the reality of football.",
      "\"We want to keep our group together, we want to be progressive and Sandro plays a part in that. All encompassed, I don't see an issue but I don't control everything. There was certainly no intention from our side to lose Sandro at all. He's such an integral player to what we're doing. He's very happy here.",
      "\"He is absolutely fine. I had discussions with him yesterday [Monday] and he is absolutely focused on playing for us.\"",

      "Gary Neville has been speaking about what's next for Manchester United(Image: The Gary Neville podcast on YouTube)",
      "Gary Neville has claimed that Manchester United have already started the search for their next head coach, indicating the Old Trafford hierarchy have not been swayed by Michael Carrick's fine start to life in the role.",
      "Carrick, 44, has made a seismic impact since stepping in to replace the sacked Ruben Amorim last month, with Saturday's 2-0 win over Tottenham making it four wins from four for the former Middlesbrough manager. That run of results, the first time United have won four games on the spin since Erik ten Hag's reign, have fuelled calls for Carrick to be considered for the United job long-term.",
      "Speaking on the eve of Saturday's game, Carrick himself insisted there could be no 'knee-jerk' decisions over the role.",
      "And Neville, speaking on The Gary Neville Podcast, has revealed that the process to appoint a new man is already underway: \"I made my position clear a few weeks ago and what I'm not going to do is repeat it every week, but what I did, I actually spoke to the club, because ultimately the club get asked all the time from journalists and broadcasters, what's the position of the club.",
      "\"It's a very difficult situation, you've got a massive movement now with what's happened towards giving Carrick the job, saying that really he should be considered. That's only going to build the more that he wins and the more that he gets closer to Champions League football.",
      "\"I asked the club what is the official position of the football club in terms of what you're saying publicly to everybody else. I have to say I thought their answer was pretty good. They said they've actually begun the process now, starting to look for another manager, which I thought right.",
      "\"That's good to hear because you need to plan for everything. They've started the process of speaking to and looking at other managers, building all the sorts of data and analysing who should be the next manager of the football club. But what they've said is they're not going to be bounced into - irrespective of wins or draws or losses on the pitch in this next couple of months - making an appointment. They're going to wait until towards the end of the season.\"",
      "Carrick has made a perfect start in the Manchester United job but may not get the gig full-time(Image: Marc Atkins/Getty Images)",
      "Carrick spent two-and-a-half years in the Championship with Middlesbrough before he was sacked by the club last summer. Prior to his stint in the second-tier, he was part of Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's coaching staff at Old Trafford and also had a brief interim stint in the job after the Norwegian was sacked back in 2021.",
      "Neville, though, went on to question whether or not his former team-mate would actually put himself forward for the role full-time given where the club currently are.",
      "He continued: \"If Michael then at that point makes himself available for the job, and I did actually say a couple of weeks ago, I wondered whether Michael actually would say no. He is that type of guy Michael, he's someone who would always work in the best interest of the football club. He may do that, or he might say no, I feel comfortable enough and I've built such a good relationship with the players, his coaching staff to put his name in the hat.",
      "\"At that point Michael Carrick, like in any other recruitment role in the country for any other business, would go into what would be a process versus the likes of Thomas Tuchel and all the others that are going to become available in the summer. I think that's fair.\"",

      "United's 2-0 win over Tottenham on Saturday made it four in succession since Carrick was made interim manager last month. Mainoo has played 90 minutes in all four of Carrick's games in charge, helping them beat Manchester City, Arsenal, Fulham and Spurs to solidify fourth place in the Premier League.",
      "When Amorim was still around, the 20-year-old United academy graduate had been agitating for a transfer in January window, with Napoli keen on signing him. But the Portuguese manager's sacking on January 5 changed everything for him, with two assists and some telling contributions coming over the last month.",
      "Former Arsenal and England striker Wright has always been a fan of Mainoo and believes that, while his recent form is a boost to Carrick's reputation, it should also damage Amorim's. \"Everybody was confused with what was happening under Ruben Amorim,\" Wright said on the Premier League World Show after the win over Spurs.",

And the set-piece special gave Bryan Mbeumo his third goal in four games under Carrick. He is certainly enjoying life under the man who is, for now, only a short-term manager.",
      "Carrick has now celebrated four victories, his side scoring ten goals in the process. In their previous four Premier League games, Manchester United had won only one, scoring five goals in the process.",
      "It certainly looks like a quite spectacular resurgence but Mbeumo believes it is not as dramatic as most people like to make out. Mbeumo clearly believes they were making some sort of progress under Ruben Amorim.",
      "He explains: “I just feel we built on what we were doing from the start because I don't think it was that bad as a lot of people felt. We just work together, make the effort together, with a big mentality, and we're never beaten. Even if someone gets past, we come back to support and just try to give it our all.”",
      "Mbeumo now has ten goals in all competitions since his £71million move from Brentford in the summer and his latest effort came from a short-corner routine that was, in part, the training-ground work of Jonny Evans. Carrick praised Evans for his work but Mbeumo admitted things did not quite go to plan when they first tried it out.",
      "Mbeumo said: “It was Jonny Evans who was coming to me and the guys and we just tried to hit it. We did it once but it didn't work out. But this one was the most important.”",
      "Mbeumo struck soon after Spurs skipper Cristian Romero had been sent off and his goal sparked another carnival-style occasion at Old Trafford that ended with Bruno Fernandes sealing victory. The feelgood factor is definitely back.",
      "Michael Carrick has won all four of his games in this stint as Manchester United manager(Image: Marc Atkins/Getty Images)",
      "The Cameroon striker smiled: “The fans are a massive community and we feel that when we get onto the pitch. We want to make them happy, so we just try to use their energy that they give us and try to give our best.”",
      "Mbeumo is clearly determined not to get carried away with United’s fine run of form. And the same goes for his manager.",
      "Apart from the odd moment or two, Carrick cuts a calm and composed figure in the technical area, despite the excitement of four victories on the spin. He is certainly no Pep Guardiola in his level of animation.",
      "Carrick explained: “I think it's just managing the moment. I'm not particularly thinking I need to look a certain way. I’m not into that. It's not a performance for me.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo's opener against Spurs came from a slick short-corner routine(Image: Marc Atkins, Getty Images)",
      "“I think it helps make clear decisions. It’s trying to understand how the game's going on. There's certainly an emotional side, you know.",
      "“I’ve made myself look a little bit silly with some of the celebrations from certain goals that we've had, but that's part of football, and you've got to enjoy the moments at certain times. But there's definitely another bit of trying to be calm and thoughtful and calculate it at the right time as well.”",
      "His calm and thoughtful approach is certainly paying dividends and that is the way in which he is determined to carry on, saying: “We're not getting carried away. I'm certainly not thinking everything's great. We've cracked it, you know? There's a lot of work to do, so I'm fully aware of that.”",

      "Kobbie Mainoo has played every minute of Michael Carrick's four games as Manchester United manager(Image: Getty Images)",
      "As well-executed as it was, the short-corner routine that gave Manchester United the lead really should not be working against professional defences. It looked clever because it produced a goal, of course. It was fairly basic stuff, though, that was successful mainly because Spurs players somehow failed to see it coming or react.",
      "But those Spurs players were not the first - and won’t be the last - to be fooled by the excellence of Kobbie Mainoo. Somehow, they did not notice Mainoo nipping away from the front post to receive the kick before reversing a pass to Bryan Mbeumo that the United forward scuffed past Guglielmo Vicario.",
      "And that is Mainoo. So much of what he does well goes unnoticed. There is nothing flashy. He is undemonstrative.",
      "There is no finger-pointing, no arm-waving. He is no shrinking violet but he tends not to get involved in many spats.",
      "Among those who did not notice Mainoo’s strengths was Ruben Amorim. Either it was one of those inexplicable blind spots that a manager can have or Amorim saw something that he didn’t quite like.",
      "Because Mainoo would give midfield balance to any elite team. Reinstated to the team, Mainoo has been quietly efficient in Michael Carrick’s perfect four-game run.",
      "And what Carrick sees is the perfect combination of a 20-year-old still on a learning curve yet one already with invaluable experiences in his locker. Don’t forget, Mainoo started a European Championship final. He scored a goal in an FA Cup final.",
      "“There’s definitely more to come from him but he also has so much experience under his belt,” says Carrick. “He has experience of big occasions, big games, of pressurised situations. He's having a really big impact on games and we'll keep working with him and helping him, try and keep improving him as well as we go along.”",

      "Michael Carrick has made the perfect start as Manchester United manager(Image: Marc Atkins/Getty Images)",
      "While the likes of Bruno Fernandes has been outstanding in United’s resurgence, the midfield combination of Mainoo and Casemiro has been at the heart of the revival. The pair have been outstanding.",
      "“That is going to help him develop,” Carrick explains. “Playing next to Case, learning from him, learning things he’s probably not even realising he is picking up. I think that is just part of his journey to learn and develop.",
      "“He's at the stage he's at in his career when he's just starting out, essentially. But he’s come in, he's played four games, and he's found his rhythm.”",
      "And in only four games - the latest win courtesy of the Mbeumo goal and a late Fernandes effort, both after Cristian Romero’s first-half, game-changing red card - Carrick has already made a compelling case to be given the long-term manager’s job. Quite simply, he has transformed the mood at the club.",

And it's difficult to comment in terms of what's changed. I'm pleased with the buy-in, with the connection. Everyone's invested in it. I think that goes a long way.",
      "“The game can flow in different ways and you can look very different, good or bad, but I think being in a really good emotional place helps you.”",

      "Napoli found themselves trailing after an early penalty but McTominay played a key role in levelling the score, with his shot rebounding for United loanee Rasmus Hojlund to tap home. The Scotland international then stole the show, scoring a spectacular long-range effort just two minutes later.",
      "However, the 29-year-old was withdrawn at half-time due to an injury, much to the dismay of manager Antonio Conte. Genoa equalised before the hour mark, capitalising on a defensive mistake, and Napoli's grip on the game seemed to be slipping when Juan Jesus was shown a red card with just 15 minutes left on the clock.",
      "In McTominay's absence, it was Hojlund who emerged as the hero, securing three points for his side with a last-minute penalty that slipped under the goalkeeper. After the match, Napoli's boss Conte gave an update on McTominay's injury.",
      "\"Scott has been dealing with this problem since the beginning of the year,\" he said. \"It's an inflammation of the tendons in the area between the gluteus maximus and the hamstrings. This discomfort forces him to play at a reduced pace.",
      "\"He would have continued, but at the end of the first half I preferred to avoid any stupid risks. We're talking about a key player for us, I need him to be 100%. We hope to get him back as soon as possible.\"",
      "Despite featuring for just 45 minutes, McTominay's impact proved crucial to a result that left Napoli six points adrift of Serie A leaders Inter Milan. Here's how the Italian press assessed the former United man's display.",
      "Praised for his involvement in Napoli's opening goal by \"Prince Rasmus\", McTominay received plaudits for \"a magnificent moral brace\". Il Napolista awarded the midfielder an eight out of 10.",
      "Antonio Conte addressed McTominay's injury(Image: Isabella BONOTTO / AFP via Getty Images)",
      "His willingness to play through injury drew comparisons to Braveheart. Wishing McTominay a swift return to fitness, the summary of his performance ended with the line: \"God save Scott McTominay.\"",
      "The Italian publication handed McTominay an eight for his efforts while playing through discomfort. Corriere dello Sport summed up the midfielder's character: \"When the going gets tough, he's always the toughest.\"",
      "His strike was described as \"beautiful\" and his overall performance was \"exceptional\". The way he continued to \"shoot, run and fight like hell\" saw him labelled the \"Rocky of football\".",
      "McTominay and Rasmus Hojlund were vital to Napoli's win over Genoa(Image: Isabella BONOTTO / AFP via Getty Images)",

      "Instead of highlighting his long-distance attempt, it was his contribution to Hojlund's equaliser that was noted as \"a precise right-footed shot\". He received a seven in the outlet's player ratings.",

      "With Rafinha sidelined through injury, Rashford was given his first league start since January 3 and grasped the opportunity with both hands. Robert Lewandowski broke the deadlock in the 29th minute after a Rashford shot was blocked.",
      "Lamine Yamal, finding the net for a fifth consecutive match, added a second just past the hour mark before fellow youngster Marc Bernal sealed the win with his maiden senior goal seven minutes from the final whistle.",
      "However, it was Rashford that garnered most of the plaudits from the media and supporters, who gave the on-loan Manchester United attacker a standing ovation when he was withdrawn midway through the second period.",
      "Mundo Deportivo described Rashford's display as \"hyperactive\" and commended him for energising Barca after a lethargic opening. They wrote: \"By far, one of Barca's most purposeful players in a first half that was collectively very flat.",
      "\"Taking Flick's challenge to heart, he assumed attacking responsibility when the game looked its worst, producing the most dangerous shots, the second leading to the 1-0 goal, and sending a beautiful free kick straight off the crossbar. Substituted to well-deserved applause.\"",
      "El Desmarque, referencing the side's sluggish opening, lauded both Rashford and Yamal for rousing Barca \"from their siesta\". AS also commended Rashford, while noting he enjoyed greater freedom compared to Yamal, who was \"constantly facing a three-on-one on the right flank\". They additionally observed that \"Rashford's form has improved throughout the season\".",
      "Rashford took his chance with both hands(Image: Josep LAGO/AFP via Getty Images)",
      "The Barca Universal website awarded Rashford an impressive 8.5/10 rating, stating: \"Rashford was perhaps Barcelona's most potent threat in the first half as he did not hesitate to cut in and shoot, creating a ruckus in the Mallorca area and bombarding Roman's goal with powerful strikes.",
      "\"He also did well providing a wide threat, although his crosses were well defended for the greater part. In fact, the opening goal stemmed from his shot on goal which fell kindly for Lewandowski.\"",
      "Rashford impressed both fans and media with his performance(Image: Pablo Rodriguez/Quality Sport Images/Getty Images)",
      "Football Espana weren't quite as generous with their marks, handing him a 7/10 while still delivering glowing praise: \"Barcelona's best attacker, and he can count himself unlucky that he did not find the back of the net with one of his ferocious strikes.\"",
      "Meanwhile, Barca Blaugranes suggested the Catalan giants stirred into life \"thanks in large part to Marcus Rashford, who was the brightest and most active of the Blaugrana attackers\".",

      "Bruno Fernandes has contributed a staggering sum in tax over the past year amid uncertainty over his Manchester United future. The club skipper, who pockets around £300,000 weekly, ranks among Britain's highest taxpayers.",
      "In the last 12 months alone, he's handed over approximately £9million to the Treasury, according to the recently published Sunday Times Tax List. His substantial earnings reflect his status as arguably United's most dependable performer throughout a turbulent period for the club, which has seen a succession of managers come and go.",
      "Reports suggest Fernandes has become weary of the constant turmoil, with fellow Portuguese Ruben Amorim becoming the latest manager to be axed. The midfielder has previously considered a switch to the Saudi Pro League, but rejected a move to the Gulf state last summer.",
      "Fresh offers are almost certain to arrive this summer, though supporters will be hoping the resurgence under Michael Carrick can persuade the 31-year-old to remain at Old Trafford. His contract runs until summer 2027, with a 12-month extension option. Yet the financial attractions of relocating to Saudi Arabia are clear.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UTD FB PAGE! Latest United news and more on our dedicated Facebook page",
      "Beyond the enormous wages on offer, footballers pay no tax on their income in the kingdom. This contrasts sharply with the 45 per cent levy on earnings above £125,000 in Britain.",
      "While he perhaps couldn't dream of matching Cristiano Ronaldo's eye-watering £3.74m weekly earnings, a pay packet hovering around the £1m mark wouldn't be unrealistic. Take Karim Benzema and Riyad Mahrez, for example, who both pocket more than £800,000 a week.",
      "Fernandes isn't even the biggest tax contributor at United. That is Casemiro, a player who's certain to depart the club come summer.",
      "Fernandes is likely to be in demand again this summer(Image: CameraSport via Getty Images)",
      "The Brazilian midfielder commands a staggering £375,000 per week according to the Sunday Times list, which means he's forked out nearly £11m in tax over the past year.",
      "That places him as the third-highest taxpayer in British football, trailing only Manchester City's Erling Haaland (£17m) and Liverpool's Mohamed Salah (£14.5m).",
      "Casemiro is getting ready to leave English football after contributing a huge amount to the public purse(Image: John Walton/PA Wire)",

      "Fernandes matches City's Bernardo Silva on £9m. Topping the overall tax list was bookmaker Betfred, which handed over £400m to the Treasury. Music stars Harry Styles and Ed Sheeran, along with boxer Anthony Joshua, also feature in the top 100.",

Throughout his debut campaign at Stamford Bridge, Palmer found the net 27 times across all competitions, secured numerous individual accolades, and cemented his place in the England squad.",

      "Bryan Mbeumo took advantage, rolling home United's opener a few minutes before half time. It wasn't until the final 10 minutes that the points were made safe thanks to a Bruno Fernandes effort but Carrick won't be complaining too much.",

      "Before the turn of the year, Kobbie Mainoo could barely get a look in at Manchester United. Ruben Amorim preferred to use Bruno Fernandes in a deeper role alongside Casemiro, meaning the England international had to make do with occasional cameos from the bench.",
      "Things have changed under Michael Carrick, though, with Fernandes pushed forward and Mainoo brought into the starting XI in a 4-2-3-1 set-up. He has barely missed a minute under the interim boss, starting four games out of four and playing another 90 minutes against Spurs before making way for Tyler Fletcher in second-half stoppage time.",

The former centre-back was brought in to work with caretaker Darren Fletcher after Ruben Amorim was sacked and has remained in place since Michael Carrick's appointment.",
      "\"It's not an issue with Jonny Evans, it's an issue with the club and the decision-making, who they're bringing in,\" Keane said, pointing to the Northern Irishman's lack of experience in the coaching environment. However, Carrick singled out Evans for the part he played in United's opener on Saturday to leave the one-time skipper with egg on his face.",

      "The England international bagged all of Chelsea's goals in the 3-1 triumph at Molineux. His opening two strikes came from the penalty spot, as the Blues maintained their impressive run under Liam Rosenior.",
      "After converting his first spot-kick, Palmer opted against his trademark 'cold' celebration and instead sprinted towards the travelling supporters with his hands covering his ears, before blowing a kiss to the travelling Chelsea faithful.",
      "The gesture follows claims that he was experiencing homesickness and was prepared to return to Manchester with boyhood outfit Manchester United. However, Palmer now seems to have dispelled those rumours.",
      "Speaking to BBC Match of the Day following the victory, he explained: \"Everyone loves to chat rubbish, don't they? I don't pay too much attention to it.",
      "\"You see things. But I feel like I've come from a strong place anyway so I don't pay attention to it.\"",
      "The midfielder also heaped praise on new boss Rosenior. \"Life under Liam is amazing, he gives us all confidence,\" he said.",
      "\"Lets us be ourselves, play free. I'm sure when I'm back proper fit you'll see the best of me. Him and all the staff give us all confidence on the training pitch, with his strategies, the way we play... I really like it.\"",
      "Palmer's campaign has been plagued by fitness issues, with him sidelined for 21 matches across all competitions this term. He has, though, appeared in the previous four fixtures in all competitions, getting the nod in the last two Premier League outings.",
      "He offered a revealing acknowledgement regarding his condition. \"I don't think [I'm 100% fit] just yet,\" he said.",
      "\"Obviously people don't know what goes on behind the scenes but being injured the whole season is not ideal and when I'm not able to perform as I want to because I've been injured, and still dealing with the injury, but hopefully I can get over the injury soon by managing it. I know what level I can provide when I feel 100% fit.",
      "Cole Palmer scored a first-half hat-trick for Chelsea against Wolves (Image: Ben Roberts Photo, Getty Images)",
      "\"Not being 100% fit isn't ideal, I still feel like I can help the team but when I'm back to full fitness I feel like I can go to another level.\"",
      "In conversation with Chelsea's official site, Palmer continued: \"I've never been injured before in my career. This is something new to me, and I'm still finding out how to deal with it.",
      "\"It has been frustrating, I don't feel like I've played a game this season fully fit. I've been going into games thinking, 'Can I do certain things? Can I not?' Overthinking it.",
      "\"The staff have been really good. I've been working closely with the physios on a day-to-day basis. They have all helped, and I'll get through it.",
      "\"I'm not here to make excuses, and ''ll get over the injuries. I know what I can do when I'm fit, and hopefully I can get back to that soon. For now, I just manage it and get there.\"",

      "Kobbie Mainoo has played 90 minutes in each of the last four games(Image: Getty Images)",
      "Michael Carrick believes there is ‘more to come’ from Kobbie Mainoo as his Manchester United renaissance rolls on. The midfielder looked set to have little future at Old Trafford under former boss Ruben Amorim having fallen out of contention under the Portuguese coach.",
      "He was even linked with a move away from the club, Italian side Napoli among those interested in him. But Mainoo is now firmly back in the fold at United, having played 90 minutes in each of the last four games.",
      "And it appears Carrick is a big fan, tipping Mainoo for a bright future. Speaking after Saturday’s 2-0 win vs Spurs, he said: “There’s definitely more to come from him, that’s just the age he’s at, the stage he’s at in his career you’d like to think, he’s just starting out really essentially. He has got so much experience under his belt in big games and pressured situations, which is going to help him develop learning the game.",
      "“Playing next to Case [Casmiro] and learning off him, things that he’s probably not even realising he’s picking things up just by being next to him, as well as the other players around him, I think that’s just part of his journey to learn and develop.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UTD FB PAGE! Latest United news and more on our dedicated Facebook page",
      "“I’m really conscious that he’s come in, he’s played the four games and he’s found his rhythm. Young players, they have times when they’re up and then they might have a little dip. That’s not all of a sudden he’s good or he’s a poor player, Kobbie is what he is.",
      "“Managing that’s really important, especially for younger players and understanding that. He’s doing fantastic at the moment, he’s having a really big impact on games, and we’ll keep working with him and helping him, trying to keep improving him as well as we go.",
      "Asked how Mainoo has overcome a challenging season to re-establish himself as a key player at United, Carrick replied: “There’s no doubt of Kobbie’s ability and what he can bring, he’s still so young and let’s be careful of not putting so much right on his shoulders and expecting so much of him. He’s still learning the game.",
      "Mainoo is now firmly back in contention at Manchester United(Image: Getty Images)",
      "“Because he’s had the big high and then obviously didn’t play for a bit, it’s easy to think he’s a lot older and more experienced probably than he is. But credit to him, he’s come right in and find his rhythm with football, which is not easy after a period of time out and he’s found that physically and mentally.",
      "“We know he can handle the ball and hopefully over time, I’m sure he’ll keep improving. We’ve got to be patient and not expect too much from him all the time.”",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Sancho, 25, finally chalked up his first Premier League goal contribution at the weekend as he teed-up Morgan Rogers for Villa’s opener against Bournemouth. While Emery has claimed that he is improving, the Spaniard has said that he wants to see even more from the United forward.",
      "He said: \"Hopefully he is getting better and he can help us in this process like he is, getting better. I expect more from him, and because I am positive, hopefully he will give us it.\"",
      "Sancho has spent the past few seasons away from Old Trafford, with the winger having taken in three separate loan spells. He was with former club Borussia Dortmund during the second-half of the 2023/24 season.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UTD FB PAGE! Latest United news and more on our dedicated Facebook page",
      "Sancho was then sent to Chelsea last term, with the Blues having agreed to a £25m obligation to buy, albeit the Blues paid £5m to back out of that agreement. Sancho's current United deal expires this summer and is yet to put pen to paper on a new deal with the Red Devils.",
      "Elsewhere, Sancho is not the only one of his Villa stars that Emery has sent a message to. Brazilian midfielder Douglas Luiz re-joined the side on loan from Juventus in January despite reported interest from Chelsea.",

      "It is set to be the year of the midfield at Manchester United. If 2025 was all about revamping the attack, the focus this summer is going to fall on the centre of the pitch. United will target two new midfielders this summer, with one tasked with replacing Casemiro, who will leave at the end of the season when his contract expires.",
      "Manuel Ugarte is also likely to move on and there is every chance the midfield options available to whoever the head coach is at the start of the 2026/27 season will look a lot different to now.",
      "But six weeks ago, there was a fear that the entire midfield might need to be rebuilt. Bruno Fernandes had thrust his own future back into the news and Kobbie Mainoo's chances of playing under Ruben Amorim looked as distant as ever.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FACEBOOK PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "Fernandes now looks happy and settled again and Champions League football would surely convince the club captain to stay on, while no player has had a bigger transformation under Michael Carrick than Mainoo.",
      "Try MEN Premium NOW for just £1",
      "The academy graduate is not only back in the team, but looking like the player who enjoyed a spectacular breakthrough in the second half of the 2023/24 season. For all the talk of United signing a £100million midfielder this summer, Mainoo's recent form is a reminder they might already have one on their hands. He was the best player on the pitch in Saturday's win against Tottenham.",
      "“There's definitely more to come from him, and that's just the age he's at, the stage he's at in his career. He’s just starting out, essentially,\" Carrick said after watching Mainoo run the show.",
      "“He’s got so much experience under his belt of big occasions, big games, and pressurised situations. That's going to help him develop and playing next to Case, and learning off him, things that he's probably not even realising he's picking up, just playing next to him as well as the other players around him.",
      "“I think that's just part of his journey to learn and develop. As I said, I'm really conscious that he's come in, he's played the four games, and he's found his rhythm. Young players will have times when they're up, and then they might have a little dip, that's not all of a sudden, he's good, or he's a poor player. Kobbie is what he is.",
      "“Managing that's really important, especially for younger players, and understanding that. So he's done fantastic at the moment. He's having a really big impact on games and we'll keep working with him and helping him, try and keep improving him as well as we go.”",
      "The irony of that is that Mainoo is actually one of the lowest-paid players in the squad, as he is still on the contract he signed as a 17-year-old in February 2023. His return to the starting XI has again triggered bonuses, but that still leaves him short of many of his teammates.",
      "Now that he is back in the fold, there is a desire to fix that. United never had any intention of letting their prized academy graduate leave and now they will show him how much he is valued by opening talks over a new deal, with the hope they can be concluded by the end of the season.",
      "That would be a significant boost ahead of the summer. On this form, Mainoo is one of the first names on the teamsheet, and with Fernandes as the starting No.10, there is only one spot left to fill in the strongest team. It is easy to imagine someone like Elliot Anderson coming in and finishing off that midfield trio.",
      "Whatever business United end up doing this summer, securing a new contract for Mainoo might be the best of it. He is the poster boy for the academy in recent years, as well as a brilliant footballer when shown the faith that Carrick has given him in recent weeks.",
      "He is also only 20 and there is clearly more to come, as Carrick explained on Saturday. This is a player who started the European Championship final at 18, and he should be part of United's midfield for years to come. Giving him a contract that reflects that status is now crucial.",
      "Mainoo has just over a year left on his existing deal, with the option of another 12 months, but United know he needs a new contract. If that is signed and sealed before the summer, then it will be one significant piece of business completed before the window opens.",

      "\"That's going to help him develop, learn the game and playing next to Case, and learning off him, things that he's probably not even realising he's picking up,\" Carrick said. \"Just playing next to him as well as the other players around him - I think that's just part of his journey to learn and develop.\"",
      "It is easy to forget that Mainoo is still one of the youngest players in the squad. He has enjoyed more exposure with United and England than most players could even dream of, but he is still in the development stage of his career. That is why United need to be very careful in the next summer transfer window as they look to overhaul their midfield.",
      "Casemiro will be departing the club at the end of his contract. While that is the right decision for all involved, it does mean United are losing someone who Carrick believes is mentoring Mainoo without the youngster even knowing it. The direct replacement for Casemiro will be a much younger player with a high ceiling.",
      "Brighton's Carlos Baleba has been on the United radar since last summer and remains on it despite a difficult campaign to date. Crystal Palace's Adam Wharton and Nottingham Forest's Elliot Anderson are also highly rated by those at Old Trafford. But those players do not boast a wealth of experience playing at the highest level, and Mainoo needs a mentor to help him reach his full potential.",
      "If United do sign one of Baleba, Wharton or Anderson to strengthen their midfield, they also need to add a more experienced head who they and Mainoo can learn from.",
      "The risk with allowing Casemiro to leave was the fact there are few midfielders with his experience - not only in the Premier League but in European football. It still remains the right call to allow the Brazilian to depart but Carrick has reminded United just how important it is to not completely sacrifice experience as they rebuild their midfield this summer.",

      "Shaw heaped praise on Carrick.(Image: 2026 Manchester United FC)",
      "Luke Shaw believes Michael Carrick's understanding of Manchester United has been crucial to improving results. United claimed their fourth successive Premier League win against Tottenham last weekend.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo and Bruno Fernandes got on the scoresheet. Spurs made a promising start to the match, but Cristian Romero's sending off in the 29th minute saw the game swing in United's favour.",
      "United are in fourth position in the Premier League, five points clear of Liverpool in sixth. Carrick has made a huge impact since his appointment as interim head coach last month, winning all of his games so far, and Shaw provided insight into the changes he's made when he spoke after beating Tottenham.",

      "Speaking to talkSPORT, Shaw said: \"He's made lots of difference. But for me, the biggest one is he knows the club, and he knows exactly what's needed to win football matches, to make everyone happy and to enjoy what we're doing.",
      "\"He's, of course, won a lot when he was here as a player. So he understands the club, and I think that's the biggest thing for me. He knows how to get the best out of the players, and he's really doing that.",
      "\"Of course, winning football matches is always going to make everyone feel better, and the confidence is at a real high. We can't take our foot off the pedal. We just have to keep going and keep pushing each other.\"",
      "When asked whether it was Carrick's understanding of how United should play that had made the difference, Shaw responded: \"No, everything, it's everything. Of course, the culture is extremely important, and day in, day out, how we are as a team, how the mentality is, how the focus is.",
      "\"How we push each other day in, day out, that's one thing Carrick has brought it, and I think everyone's just really enjoying themselves at the moment. You see how important not just the starting XI are, it's the ones that are coming off the bench as well, making an impact.",
      "\"Even when we score in the celebrations, it's not just the players on the pitch. It's the ones on the bench that are running around and celebrating, too. And I think that shows a real togetherness.",
      "\"And I think when we're together like that, it's a real strong bond, and we go out on the pitch and we all fight for each other and everyone's really together, and of course it always helps.\"",
      "Shaw added that the team's attention will quickly turn to facing West Ham in London on Tuesday night. The Irons have struggled this season, but they have won three of their last four league matches. West Ham are three points adrift of safety.",

We did it once, it didn't work out, but this one was the most important.\"",

      "Hello and welcome to our live Manchester United transfer blog on Monday, February 9 2026.",
      "Reports on Sunday linked Newcastle United midfielder Sandro Tonali with a move to Old Trafford. The Italian is reportedly growing unsettled at St. James' Park and was the subject of a late enquiry by Arsenal in the winter.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FB PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "On the pitch, United took another step towards a top-four finish with a 2-0 win over Tottenham Hotspur. Goals from Bryan Mbeumo and Bruno Fernandes made it four wins in four for Michael Carrick.",
      "Focus now turns to Tuesday night's trip to West Ham United, who have picked up form themselves.",
      "We'll bring you all of the latest news in live updates below...",
      "Ian Wright has suggested that Kobbie Mainoo's revival under Michael Carrick at Manchester United should be a source of embarrassment for Ruben Amorim. Mainoo, who was largely overlooked during Amorim's tenure, has become a pivotal figure in United's recent upturn in form under interim head coach Carrick.",
      "United's 2-0 victory over Tottenham Hotspur on Saturday marked their fourth consecutive win since Carrick took over last month. Mainoo has played the full 90 minutes in almost all of Carrick's matches at the helm, helping them defeat Manchester City, Arsenal, Fulham and Spurs to secure fourth place in the Premier League.",
      "The 20-year-old United academy graduate had been considering a move in the January transfer window during Amorim's reign, with Napoli showing interest. However, Amorim's dismissal on January 5 changed everything for him, with two assists and several key contributions coming in the past month.",
      "Read more here",
      "Manchester United have joined Aston Villa, Newcastle United and Tottenham as the clubs 'most interested' in Juventus defender Pierre Kalulu.",
      "According to Italian journalist Mirko Di Natale, the clubs want to bring him to the Premier League in the summer. Kalulu is in line to feature for France at the World Cup.",
      "Aston Villa manager Unai Emery has admitted he \"expects more\" from Jadon Sancho. The Manchester United winger moved to the Midlands club on a season-long loan during the summer.",
      "However, he has made a sluggish start to his Villa career. Sancho has found the net just once, with that goal arriving in a Europa League win against Turkish outfit Fenerbahce last month.",
      "The 25-year-old finally registered his first Premier League goal contribution at the weekend when he set up Morgan Rogers for Villa's opening goal against Bournemouth. Whilst Emery has acknowledged that he is progressing, the Spanish boss has stated that he wants to see further improvement from the United attacker.",
      "Read more here",
      "Kai Rooney continued his impressive form this season by scoring four of Manchester United's six goals in the Under‑16s' 6-4 win over Norwich City in the Premier League Cup semi‑final.",
      "The 16-year-old, who made his debut at Old Trafford last month, put in another outstanding display as the young Reds booked a place in the final.",
      "Taking to Instagram afterwards, the son of United legend Wayne, posed with the match ball and held up four fingers to show how many goals he scored. He then re‑shared a post by Rising Ballers, whose caption suggested it wouldn't be long before fans see him playing for the first team.",
      "The post read: \"Kai Rooney is different… Scored 4 goals today for United in the PL Cup semi‑final against Norwich… Been on fire recently… It won't be long until you see him in and around the first team… Goalscoring DNA runs in the family.\"",
      "Man United are one of the players interested in signing Brentford defender Michael Kayode, according to reports.",
      "TEAMtalk have claimed that Newcastle and Manchester City are all showing interest. The 21-year-old has impressed at Brentford, but he will cost 'in excess of £50m', but there's no pressure to sell him.",
      "Joshua Zirkzee has been told why leaving Manchester United may be the best move for his career.",
      "Zirkzee’s future has been the subject of intense speculation since the start of the season, but the striker has remained at Old Trafford despite two transfer windows passing by.",
      "United signed Zirkzee from Bologna in the summer of 2024 and was one of the final signings of Erik ten Hag’s tenure at Old Trafford.",
      "Read more here",
      "Michael Carrick may just be four matches into an interim head coaching stint with Manchester United, but he has already shown up the failures that Erik ten Hag and Ruben Amorim managed in their disastrous time in charge during the 2024/25 season.",
      "There was a wealth of scepticism in the air when the 44-year-old arrived at Old Trafford last month. United fans were well within their right, of course, given that he was only sacked by Middlesbrough in the summer for guiding the club to a lacklustre 10th place finish in the Championship standings in 2024/25.",
      "Meanwhile, Carrick's caretaker role with the club following the departure of Ole Gunnar Solskjaer in November 2021 lasted less than a month before he was replaced by Ralf Rangnick.",
      "During his initial stint at the helm, Carrick achieved two wins and a draw from a total of three matches before he announced his shock decision to depart after a win against Arsenal and be replaced by the German - with Ten Hag taking up tenure at the end of 2021/22. What ensued next was two years of rot and questionable choices with an FA Cup trophy lift thrown in before the Dutchman was ultimately given the boot in October 2024, with Amorim left to pick up the pieces.",
      "Read more here",
      "Chelsea star Cole Palmer has played down speculation linking him with a move away from Stamford Bridge.",
      "Palmer scored a hat-trick in the 3-1 win over Wolves at the weekend and seemed to send a message about his future. Speaking to BBC Match of the Day following the victory, he said: \"Everyone loves to chat rubbish, don't they?",
      "\"I don't pay too much attention to it,\" Palmer said, when asked about his celebration. \"You see things. But I feel like I've come from a strong place anyway so I don't pay attention to it.\"",
      "Man United face an unexpected transfer battle to keep Lisandro Martinez, according to CaughtOffside.",
      "The report states that Barcelona are one of the clubs keeping an eye on his situation. Martinez's contract expires at the end of next season and it's said that he would be open to a move to Spain.",
      "Alongside Sandro Tonali, Man United are reportedly keen on Newcastle's Anthony Gordon.",
      "Ben Jacobs has claimed that United view the forward as an option to bolster their attack. He told The United Stand: \"Manchester United really like Anthony Gordon as well as a potential option, especially knowing that the player actually relishes the chances to have more game time through the centre as a number nine as well. And Arsenal have been there in the past.",
      "“Gordon nearly went to Liverpool, but in the end, Newcastle were able to sell Elliot Anderson and Yankuba Minteh.”",
      "Manchester United have interest in Newcastle United midfielder Sandro Tonali ahead of the summer, according to The Telegraph.",
      "The 25-year-old is wanted by Juventus, with Arenal and Manchester City both said to be monitoring his situation. Tonali joins Elliot Anderson and Adam Wharton as United's midfield targets.",
      "Good morning Man United fans.",
      "It's been a busy weekend and a good one for United. It's matchday -1 with a trip to West Ham United tomorrow. So stay tuned, grab a coffee and we'll bring you the reaction from the Spurs win, the latest transfer news and build-up to the trip to London.",
      "According to TEAMTalk, Leon Goretzka's camp has contacted Manchester United with the Bayern Munich midfielder set to become a free agent when his contract expires in the summer.",
      "However, United are not the only club Goretzka's agent has contacted, with Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester City, Tottenham and Newcastle United the others they have reached out.",
      "Manchester United have joined the race to sign Brentford full-back Michael Kayode, according to reports.",
      "TEAMtalk report that Newcastle and Manchester City are also showing an interest.",
      "The 21-year-old has caught the eye with his performances for the Bees this season. Brentford are said to value the player at 'in excess of £50m', but are under no pressure to sell him in the summer.",
      "Manchester United youngster Tyler Fletcher has revealed the message that Michael Carrick told him in the second before he made his senior debut.",
      "The 18-year-old came on in the closing stages of Saturday's 2-0 win over Tottenham.",
      "\"He just said enjoy it,\" Fletcher told MUTV. \"Make the most of the moment. Go and get on the ball and do what you do, try to get as many touches as I can when I was on there, so I was trying to get little bounce passes, little short ones, just to get a few touches. That is what he said.",
      "\"That’s the best moment of my career so far. I don’t think anything can top it. It’s a special moment for my family. I think my mum is here, my brother is here. My dad has got a game so he couldn’t make it.",
      "\"It’s an unbelievable moment.\"",

      "Lamine Yamal then doubled his side’s lead just after the hour before fellow teenager Marc Bernal completed the scoring when he scored his first senior goal seven minutes from time.",
      "However, just before the half-time interval, Rashford handed his side a scare when he went down holding his knee.",
      "A number of Barca players, along with head coach Hansi Flick, all looked visibly concerned as the England international received medical treatment.",
      "Rashford, though, managed to play on before he was replaced by Ferran Torres after 67 minutes.",
      "\"What he needs, and it probably wouldn't help him, is probably to win five or six on the trot and then lose three or four on the trot, and then how do you respond?",
      "\"The only way you're ever going to know is when you lose three or four games and the scrutiny comes on you, you're at the biggest club in the world, or one of them, how are you going to cope?",
      "\"We've seen this for Solskjaer, then you see pictures of him at Watford away that day when they got destroyed and he just looked lost.",
      "\"He probably needs to lose four on the trot and then come back and win five on the trot and everyone will go 'that's a good manager, he's turned it around, the pressure was on', that's the only way we're ever going to know.\"",

      "Sandro Tonali is considering leaving Newcastle United this summer to play Champions League football next season. The midfielder has been linked with Manchester United in recent days as the club plans to bolster its midfield.",
      "United are understood to be prioritising a new central midfielder for the 2026/27 season after opting not to invest in the previous two windows. Elliot Anderson, Carlos Baleba and Adam Wharton have all been linked, but Tonali is the latest name on their radar.",
      "The Telegraph has reported that the 25-year-old is expected to be at the heart of a transfer saga in the summer. United are already confirmed to lose one midfielder when Casemiro departs and are expected to spend big on his replacement.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FB PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "Newcastle paid £55million for Tonali in 2023 and with the likes of Enzo Fernandez, Moises Caicedo and Declan Rice moving more than £100m, the Magpies are in a comfortable place to negotiate a hard price.",
      "On deadline day, some reports suggested that the Italian midfielder had been offered to Arsenal. The Gunners decided not to make a move, but that has cast doubt on his future on Tyneside.",
      "Sandro Tonali is reportedly on Man United's transfer radar(Image: Newcastle United via Getty Image)",
      "According to Tonali's agent, Giuseppe Riso, his exit out of Eddie Howe's squad is a possibility at the end of the season. \"Newcastle are having a hard time of letting go of Sandro, and he wants to lead the club to the Champions League,\" he told Sky Italy.",
      "\"We'll evaluate and decide what to do in the summer. These transfer discussions will take place later. We'll see how the season ends and then we'll decide what to do. There's no preference at the moment.",
      "\"It's still early. What we're saying today won't apply tomorrow. Newcastle couldn't let him go now, and there's no point in moving, especially since Sandro is very attached to the club.\"",
      "\"I don't think so, but lots of things happen without my knowledge,\" Howe said when asked if the speculation around Tonali's future would unsettle the midfielder. \"As far as I'm aware, we've got player who is an outstanding footballer, an outstanding person.",
      "\"He's very happy here, he's got a great relationship with me, his teammates, and seems really happy within himself. That would surprise me [if Tonali became unsettled], but our best players will always attract glances from other clubs - that's just the reality of football.",
      "\"We want to keep our group together, we want to be progressive and Sandro plays a part in that. All encompassed, I don't see an issue but I don't control everything. There was certainly no intention from our side to lose Sandro at all. He's such an integral player to what we're doing. He's very happy here.",

      "Anyone who has kept a close eye on Carrick during matches will have noticed his calm demeanour. He rarely shows emotion and stays remarkably composed, but there is a release when United score.",
      "Carrick passionately fist-pumped when Mbeumo fired United into the lead at the end of the first half, and he turned around on the touchline to look at his family celebrating in the directors' box.",
      "The 44-year-old has season tickets at Old Trafford with his family, meaning he attended a few games before his appointment, but his wife and children now have a better view in the directors' box.",
      "Carrick's son Jacey was spotted in the away end at Arsenal last month. Carrick has spoken about how much United means to him. He was raised in Newcastle and spent time in London with West Ham and Tottenham, but he has spent his most cherished years in Manchester.",
      "There may be more special years to come at Old Trafford for Carrick. It's still too early to say whether he should be given the job on a permanent basis, but he couldn't have made a better start.",
      "Casemiro enjoyed the goal",
      "Casemiro was so chuffed with Fernandes' late goal to wrap up the victory that he attempted to persuade Senne Lammens to celebrate with the team in the corner by the Stretford End.",
      "Casemiro shared a warm embrace with Lisandro Martinez before waving his hands to gesture to Lammens to join in with his teammates. The goalkeeper briefly thought about it, jogging to the halfway line, but decided to resist the temptation.",
      "Lammens is sensible and level-headed. He knew the job wasn't done yet and didn't want to get ahead of himself by joining in with the celebrations. Andre Onana, his predecessor, did not have that perspective.",
      "The unsung analyst",
      "United are the strongest team from set-pieces this season, having recorded the highest number of goals scored per 100 set-plays. Arsenal have earned a reputation as being prolific from set-pieces, but United have a better record from fewer of them, and they scored from a beautiful routine against Spurs.",
      "Fernandes played the corner short to Mainoo, who found Mbeumo in the box. There was still plenty for the Cameroon international to do - and his finish into the bottom right corner was sublime.",
      "Carlos Fernandes looked after set-pieces when Ruben Amorim was in charge. Fernandes came onto the touchline every time United won a set-piece, but Carrick's backroom staff remained seated.",
      "It's understood set-pieces are a collective responsibility among the current coaching staff, however, perhaps Kaita Hasgawa deserves another mention for doing important work behind the scenes.",
      "Amorim namedropped Hasgawa as someone who deserved praise for improving set-pieces and helping to tactically prepare for the opponent. Hasegawa's position has not been described as senior, but he was recruited from Everton after seven years in Merseyside, and is thought to play an important role.",
      "Hasgawa sat with the analyst team beside the press box against Tottenham. The analysts would have taken great satisfaction from another set-piece goal, especially after a corner routine that was so well-worked.",
      "Stretford End jeers",
      "The Romero red card changed the complexion of the game. The contest had flowed well and Tottenham looked dangerous, but Romero could have no complaints when Michael Oliver showed him a straight red.",
      "The challenge on Casemiro was reckless and the Brazilian looked in a world of pain when he slumped to the turf. Thomas Frank tried to reason with the fourth official, but had no serious case to overturn it.",
      "The Stretford End chanted Casemiro's name while he received treatment, but their attention turned to Romero as he returned to the dressing room. \"Cheerio, cheerio, cheerio,\" fans taunted as Romero walked off.",
      "Romero slammed Tottenham's board for their lack of investment when the January transfer window closed, but the Spurs captain only had himself to blame for his side's defeat.",
      "The classy Munich tributes",
      "It was the 68th anniversary of the Munich Air Disaster on Friday. United held a memorial service at Old Trafford, and there were further tributes from fans in the Stretford End before the Totttenham game.",
      "United fans unfurled a \"Busby Babes\" banner in the upper tier of the stand, which was followed by a \"we'll never die\" banner being unfurled in the lower tier. Carrick laid a wreath on the pitch alongside Frank.",
      "The players wore black armbands, and Fernandes wore a special captain's armband to pay tribute to the tragedy. Most wouldn't have seen the Munich clock attached to Fernandes' arm. \"Stand up for the Busby Babes,\" was aired in the first half, and thousands of supporters rose to their feet.",
      "United show their class with their tributes each year to the Munich Air Disaster. Fernandes attended the memorial service on the day before the game, and the armband he wore was a nice touch.",

      "Michael Carrick and Steve Holland have struck up a good dynamic at Manchester United",
      "Michael Carrick said he \"feels at home\" back at Manchester United and is loving life as the club's latest head coach, but is refusing to get carried away over the possibility of staying on beyond the end of the season. Carrick signed a contract until the end of this campaign when replacing Ruben Amorim, but he has won his first three games in charge, including wins against Manchester City and Arsenal, to move United back into the top four.",
      "The 44-year-old will be looking to make it four wins in a row against former club Tottenham today and after seven months out of the game after leaving Middlesbrough, he looks relaxed back in the spotlight at Old Trafford. But he insists that run of victories hasn't changed his or the club's plans, with United determined to conduct a thorough search for a new head and Carrick happy for that process to continue.",
      "\"I'm fully aware of the role I'm doing here and the responsibility I've got,\" he said. \"We want to be successful. I want the club to be successful beyond the end of the season: if that's me, if that's somebody else. At this stage, I can't control that, and we'll see what happens.",
      "Try MEN Premium NOW for just £1",
      "\"The results over a short period of time don't change that. If they have changed that, there is something wrong.\"",
      "Carrick has refused to push his own credentials in public since he stepped into the role in January, but he did admit ahead of the Old Trafford fixture with Tottenham that he was enjoying the experience.",
      "\"I'm loving what I'm doing. I'm here, I feel at home here, but I fully understand the situation, so I'm not getting too carried away,\" he said.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FACEBOOK PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "Carrick's start to life back at the club is all the more impressive given he had to build a coaching staff in a matter of days, with Amorim's backroom team all departing with him.",
      "He turned to former Chelsea No.2 and England assistant Steve Holland and brought Jonathan Woodgate with him after working together at Middlesbrough. Jonny Evans was recruited by United before Carrick was appointed and Travis Binnion stepped up from his role in the academy.",
      "The dynamic has worked so far, with 55-year-old Holland earning plenty of praise from the players. He has had a long and distinguished coaching career and is a United fan, having grown up in Stockport.",
      "He was recommended by Carrick's brother Graeme, who worked with Holland while he was at the Football Association, and the decision now looks an inspired one.",
      "\"I think when talks were progressing and it looked like I might be coming in here, I was spending some time thinking about what the staff might look like,\" said Carrick.",
      "\"Having conversations with my brother actually, of what it might look like. And we ended up mentioning Steve. He knew him from the FA and I have come across Steve a number of times, fully aware of his experience and his quality as a coach as well as a person. It ticked a lot of boxes, and it kind of just went from there.",
      "\"I spoke to Steve and we clicked straight away. He's had vast experiences in different scenarios. Being at Chelsea for so long, being successful winning trophies, knowing what it takes, different style, different managers, different types of players.",
      "\"He's had a real good knowledge and backstory to pick at. We speak a lot about different things, all of us, all the staff.\"",
      "Holland spent eight years at Chelsea and worked under Andre Villas-Boas, Roberto Di Matteo, Rafa Benitez, Jose Mourinho, Guus Hiddink and Antonio Conte, earning a wealth of experience at a club that regularly changed managers.",
      "Carrick also worked under Mourinho when he moved into coaching at United, with the Portuguese gifting the retiring midfielder an old whistle and a packet of headache tablets when he hung up his boots at the end of the 2018 season.",
      "\"Jose I learned a lot from in the five months when I was coaching,\" said Carrick. \"When you see how he works, how he thinks and how he sees players and things end up coming off that he predicted at certain times. So he had a real good eye for that.",
      "\"There's certainly that connection [with me and Steve]. I wouldn't say it's totally me and Steve with Jose, but it's definitely common kind of factors that help us work together, for sure.\"",

      "Try MEN Premium NOW for just £1",
      "Is Sandro Tonali a real option for the summer?",
      "I've not heard anything to suggest he is yet, but then the situation around Tonali developed quickly on deadline day. His agent threw the cat amongst the pigeons, suggesting there is some long-standing interest from Arsenal.",
      "United want a couple of midfielders, but if they go for one of Elliot Anderson, Adam Wharton or Carlos Baleba, I think they will look abroad for a second. Signing players from Premier League rivals is an expensive business and given the interest in Anderson, that could be a very big deal to do.",
      "Will more youngsters like Shea Lacey be given a chance?",
      "It's hard to see that happening at the moment. Lacey is the one knocking hardest, but the first-team squad is in good shape again in terms of fitness, and there aren't enough games to go around to give those players a chance, never mind a youngster.",
      "Lacey might get games on the bench still, but Amad, Bryan Mbeumo, Matheus Cunha and Benjamin Sesko are already four players for three spots.",
      "The other youngster to maybe keep an eye on is Jack Moorhouse. He returned from a loan spell at Leyton Orient on deadline day and has trained with the first team this week. If there is an injury in midfield, he might get a chance.",
      "Why didn't we sign a midfielder this summer?",
      "Because no long-term target became available. United were adamant they wouldn't make any short-term moves and they stuck to their word.",
      "It might be a risk not to sign a midfielder, but there are only 14 games left and any deal would have been to add back-up. I'm not sure it was really needed.",
      "There are some long breaks coming up between fixtures and Carrick has his work cut out to keep everyone happy as it is. If Casemiro or Mainoo get injured, then maybe it will look like a mistake, but for now, I don't think it was really necessary.",
      "Will Carrick get the job full-time if he gets us into the top four comfortably?",
      "You would have to think there is a chance. United insist the process is going to be thorough and Carrick is keeping his feet on the ground, but a top-four finish makes a strong argument for him.",
      "It's not impossible that United even reel in Aston Villa for third. If Carrick continues to impress, then he will probably give himself an excellent chance of a Premier League job next season, whatever his Old Trafford bosses decide.",
      "The question then might be whether they are prepared to let him go and shine elsewhere. There is a lot more football to be played this season, but Carrick's start has put him firmly in the frame.",
      "Is there a young midfielder who could replace Casemiro?",
      "I don't think there is, to be honest. There are some good youngsters coming through, but nobody in midfield that you would say is on Kobbie Mainoo's level and ready to make an impact.",
      "Moorhouse might get a chance and Jack Fletcher has already, but I'd be surprised if either was in the first-team squad next season. Sekou Kone is someone whom United have high hopes for, but the 20-year-old needs to do plenty of developing in Lausanne in the second half of the season.",
      "What are the chances that if we continue like this we can take the title?",
      "Who says people are getting carried away? In truth, I'd say the chances are non-existent. The gap is 12 points and even if United win their remaining 14 Premier League games, Arsenal would need to lose four. They have had a wobble recently, but that just isn't going to happen.",
      "A more realistic target would be to try and catch Villa. That gap is now five points and Unai Emery's side still have to come to Old Trafford, while Thursday night football is also still on the agenda for them in the Europa League.",
      "Villa are statistical outliers this season when it comes to their data and you can see their results starting to match up with their performance levels at some point.",

      "The same observation was made when Lammens reported for international duty with Belgium last week - the 23-year-old was dressed in a beige collared jacket, a khaki t-shirt and chinos.",
      "\"By accident, I saw an article saying he was wearing something boring when he reported for international duty and fans saying they hoped he stays like this,\" laughed Hayk Milkon, one of Lammens' former coaches.",
      "\"This 'boringness' is just the way Senne is, he's really calm and no excesses. He focuses on what he needs to focus on and is open with the people around him. He keeps his feet on the ground.\"",
      "If Lammens looks like someone who could work in an office, every workplace would love to have him in their five-a-side team. United believe they have signed a young goalkeeper with huge potential, and fans who were present at Old Trafford against Sunderland left the stadium buzzing about his debut.",
      "The quirk is that Lammens appears to be a different person when he wears his goalkeeper kit. He made a supremely confident United debut, aggressively commanded his area and kept a clean sheet.",

      "Milkon coached in different roles at Club Brugge. He was the assistant of Club NXT (their reserve team), served as their interim manager, was in charge of the Under-18s and eventually became a first-team coach.",
      "His time at Club Brugge coincided with Lammens progressing from the academy to their first team, so he is uniquely positioned to provide insight into United's new goalkeeper signing.",
      "Lammens joined Club Brugge's academy when he was 12. \"He was a guy with huge potential,\" said Milkon. \"As I learned from colleagues who had worked with him when he was much younger, I heard there was a moment that clicked in his head when he became super professional.",
      "\"He was one of the guys during Covid - when the players were not able to train - who was doing a lot at home, he was really going far with this to be the best in these types of areas.",
      "\"Then he continued like this when he joined the first team to train with them. He always wanted to improve. We also had something in place to look at the parameters on which goalkeepers are judged.",
      "\"You see the potential of the goalkeeper based on what they do in games; so their positioning, their decision-making and so on, and Senne was always quite high in these areas.",
      "\"The only bad luck that he had was that the first-team goalkeeper was Simon Mignolet. He's an amazing goalkeeper, so it was difficult for Senne to stay over there in the role of No.2.",
      "\"That would have also blocked his growth, so it was good for him in the end to make the step to go to Antwerp and he did a tremendous job there. It was amazing to see how fast he adapted.\"",
      "Milkon pictured during his stint with Club Brugge (he now manages F.C.V. Dender).",

      "\"That was not possible because Mignolet was there. But the parameters that we used to judge his performances indicated he was ticking so many boxes already, and he was consistently doing it.",
      "\"There weren't ups and downs with his performances. He was consistently really high and when you compare this to the top goalkeepers, you have a benchmark to say 'Ok, what potential does this guy have?'",
      "\"He had some chances with the first team at Club Brugge and made a mistake, or maybe two, but in the end it was very clear to everyone that he was a top goalkeeper.",
      "\"It was impossible to try to extend his contract because, again, you have Mignolet, and you cannot block a guy like this. You know he has to go out, he has to play, and he will improve even more.\"",
      "When asked about Lammens' strengths, he said: \"I would say that his decision-making was very good. He is very calm, he sees the solutions on the pitch, he has a quick reaction time and understands the balance between risk and reward, and which decisions are the right ones to make.",
      "\"His clean passing is great, his footwork was really good, and he's just an amazing goalkeeper with the shot-stopping. He made some incredible saves back then already. He's quite a complete goalkeeper.",
      "\"But making the right decisions at a very young age, being very mature with this, was really impressive. And the fact that he is good with both feet is another big strength.",
      "\"For me, Senne is a very calm guy and has all the qualities to be a top professional. That was my impression when I first met him when he was younger and he never changed.\"",
      "A baby-faced Lammens playing for Club Brugge in 2021. (Image: 2021 BSR Agency)",
      "Lammens joined Royal Antwerp on a free transfer in the summer of 2023. He was handed his debut a few months later and served as an understudy that season, but earned first-choice status for 2024/2025.",
      "His performances drew attention from the Belgian media. Lammens saved four penalties across a successful first full campaign and received a call-up to Belgium's senior squad in March.",
      "Milkon said: \"I was not surprised when I saw Manchester United had come calling. And to record his first clean sheet, I was really happy for him. Senne is a potential No.1 for the Red Devils - the Belgium national team.",
      "\"He got his chance, he took it, and we're all really proud of him, but we knew it would happen. I believe he has all the capabilities to become the best in the world, so I wish him all the best. I'm sure he will have a very good career in England, and Manchester United should return to the big club they used to be.",
      "\"He will have a positive impact on that, for sure, and hopefully he will be Belgium's first-choice goalkeeper soon. I believe he has the potential, the skillset and the personality to do that.",
      "\"For me, it was just having a tiny little part in having an influence on him at Brugge, but it was the most positive memories of our relationship that we had during this spell.",
      "\"I'm very proud that he is reaching these high levels and not surprised. I believe he will be successful because he is a guy who will not change his focus or start to do something different. He is calm, that's his personality and character, and he wants to succeed. He is hungry and will keep working to be his best.",
      "\"He is so calm, and you have to be patient in football. You cannot worry too much and want things too early, but finding the balance between not being impatient and, at the same time, pushing and demanding what you deserve in a good way, means everything will sort itself out.\"",
      "Lammens in action for Royal Antwerp in 2024. (Image: Photonews 2024)",
      "United staff who have worked with Lammens at Carrington have echoed Milkon's sentiments. He has been described as \"really mature for his age\" and is said to have taken the move in his stride.",
      "Lammens is understood to have impressed coaches during training sessions and a United source said that lots of people have been speaking positively about him. He has already relocated from the luxury hotel where he was initially staying and into a house.",
      "It's no surprise that Lammens likes to play basketball at 6ft 3in, but he is a keen golfer, which is common ground with the likes of Tom Heaton, Luke Shaw, Mason Mount and Harry Maguire.",
      "Matthijs de Ligt, Amad, Maguire and Shaw jogged straight to Lammens to congratulate him after full-time against Sunderland. \"Are you Schmeichel in disguise?\" was chanted at Lammens from the Stretford End.",
      "It remains to be seen whether Lammens will start against Liverpool on Sunday, but it would be a surprise to see him on the bench after delivering a strong debut before the international break.",
      "There would be nothing boring about keeping another clean sheet - this time at Anfield.",

      "An earlier version of this oft-updated piece speculated on what might happen to Mikel Arteta should Arsenal suffer from their Nightmare Start. What if they lost a few early games? What then? We concluded this:",
      "It’s far likelier that Arsenal emerge blinking into the autumn sunshine broadly unscathed from their nightmare horrors. No denying that this season does represent one in which Arteta might completely lose the plot and go entirely off the rails. Or the one where he wins the league by 10 points. Feels like we’re odds-on to get one or the other.",
      "Arsenal emerged duly unscathed, and cashed in on the shift to easier fixtures of their own alongside much tougher ones for Liverpool to take top spot and control in the Premier League.",
      "Only question that remains, therefore, is what Arsenal do from here. We are still absolutely certain that it either involves p*ssing the league by 10 points or a complete and total meltdown. Nothing in between is acceptable or even conceivable, and even now with 13 games to go both options appear tantalisingly plausible.",

      "Doing so well that even suffering the ultimate embarrassment of defeat at Old Trafford didn’t dampen spirits for the most impressive promoted club in quite some time.",
      "Nine wins in the bag already and more points than any of the promoted-relegated teams managed in the entirety of 2024/25. Widespread expectation that tougher games would bring Sunderland back down with a bump have thus far proved wide of the mark; there won’t be many teams unhappy at taking four points from three games against Chelsea and Arsenal this season. The comeback victory over Bournemouth was evidence, if indeed it was still required, that Sunderland are proper, as was beating beleaguered Palace at home.",
      "Success against Newcastle on derby day has us firmly into ‘manager of the year’ territory for one of the big pre-season Sack Race favourites.",

      "Extraordinary season for Emery already. Began the campaign right at the outside of this market with your Artetas and – unlikely as it now sounds – Slots. Then jumped right up to third favourite when Villa’s rankling disappointment at how last season ended leaked into a six-match winless start to this campaign.",
      "But then along came four Premier League wins in a row to thoroughly lift the mood at a club where a few short weeks earlier it really did feel like they’d come to the end of something special without ever getting the definitive moment of success it deserved.",
      "That run reached 12 wins in 13 Premier League games to lift Villa right through the mid-table slop, then into the top four, and then genuine title contention. And for the first 45 minutes at the Emirates it really did look like they might stick around for much longer.",
      "A sticky run has brought that talk to an end. There’s obviously no shame in not managing to stick around as unlikely title challengers for longer, but some frustration at the manner in which their charge has been halted. Home defeats to Everton and Brentford, given the fortress Villa Park had become, is a bit of a limp end to a game old fight.",
      "But they’re still very much on course for another crack at the Champions League with an eight-point lead over an unconvincing Liverpool in sixth, and they’ve also qualified unfussily for the last 16 of a very winnable Europa League. It’s all still an astonishing shift from what felt like an inexorable downward spiral not that long ago.",

      "The continuity candidate in the summer, and looked to have received the ultimate hospital pass. How much continuity could there be at Brentford given they’d sold Bryan Mbeumo, Yoane Wissa and Christian Norgaard, while Thomas Frank took most of the remaining coaching staff with him to Tottenham? It was a very Brentford move to promote from within and we’ll hold our hands up and admit we thought it would go far, far worse than it has.",
      "With Newcastle and Sunderland added to Liverpool and Manchester United on the list of Gtech victims this season and Villa now sorted out home, away and in the Carabao, it’s an undeniably impressive effort in trying circumstances.",
      "Completing the double over a Newcastle side that also chucked them all the money for Wissa is magnificent. That Brentford now sit cosily in Europe-adjacent upper mid-table, 10 points clear of their former manager and his supposedly greener pastures, even more so.",

      "Backed in to a hot favourite as the whispers began before the last international break. But just when we thought it might be time to accept something is fundamentally broken here as a relegation fight bubbled up, an impressive win over Sunderland and a restorative visit to Tottenham have sorted things out.",
      "Seven wins and two draws in 14 Premier League games since the November international break have lifted Fulham well away from the relegation battle and into the mid-table strivers, significantly lessening the real risk that either Silva or Fulham might do something they live to regret.",

      "Sounds preposterous, but there really is a non-zero chance Moyes gets punished for easing Everton’s immediate relegation fears and they seek some more enterprising football from a squad that is, in fairness, capable of that as climbing into the top six demonstrates. Does feel like a very familiar Everton story, though, and one that ends with them 16th, chastened, and bringing in another firefighter.",

      "Instantly unseated Eddie Howe and Thomas Frank at the top of the list of Premier League managers to sound most like a High Performance Podcast guest with that absurd cack about ageing men.",
      "This is Chelsea, so he absolutely could be gone before the end of the season. But this is managergeddon, and there’s almost no chance at least one other poor sod doesn’t go first. Which is for the best. We’d hate to think of Rosenior being forced out of Chelsea before he’s had any real chance to age any men at all.",
      "",
      "Remained powerfully unsackable even in the depths of one of those long forlorn runs of relegation form that Bournemouth have oft indulged in under Iraola. And now they’re back doing the other thing they do after dramatic 3-2 wins over Spurs and Liverpool and victory at Wolves.",
      "A streaky manager of a streaky team, then, but with relegation a distant memory after the prognostications of doom when he had to sell pretty much his entire defence in the summer he remains firmly in credit and back in contention for all the many ridiculous Big Six jobs that are or will be available during the summer.",
      "",
      "The hard-nosed yet valid argument persists that Leeds could and perhaps should have taken drastic action in the summer even after their very good week. It would have made Spurs’ decision to sack Europa League-winning Ange Postecoglou look positively kind, Leeds – and Burnley for that matter – might now be better off had they thanked the managers who secured 100 Championship points and got them back into the big time and then sent them on their way.",
      "Farke had a dreadful Premier League record of only six wins and 26 points from his 49 games in charge of Norwich, a team he twice led to promotion from the Championship with 94 and 97 points.",
      "As well as fighting his own record in this competition, Farke faced the added burden of expectation levels very different to those at just about any other club that could possibly find itself promoted into the Premier League in this current era where that represents the most bittersweet of successes.",
      "Defeat at Burnley was honking, but bouncing back to win another six-pointer against West Ham eased the stress significantly before a paddling at Brighton and events elsewhere – including West Ham themselves – left Farke desperately short of immediate cover before a desperately poor show in a six-pointer at Nottingham Forest.",
      "Another painful defeat having gone in front, against Villa this time, saw Leeds drop into the bottom three ahead of a brutal run of games, but that run has gone surprisingly well. The narrow loss to Man City preceded a rare home win against Chelsea and comeback draw against Liverpool.",
      "The question now is whether Leeds and Farke have really hit on something sustainable, or this is merely delaying the inevitable. After the 4-1 win against Crystal Palace and a very decent point at Sunderland, it really does start to look like it might be the latter which has enormous repercussions for both Farke and several other names around him on this list.",
      "Enormously impressive even in heartbreaking defeat at Newcastle in a wild 4-3 that earned instant classic status. Key now is to ensure that it doesn’t throw them off course, because once the initial pain subsides there is no reason why it should. Victory over Fulham suggests they’ve taken it on the chin; getting slapped silly a second time by Arsenal suggests maybe not.",
      "February is a huge month for Leeds and Farke in the league. Smashing Nottingham Forest in a proper blood-and-thunder six-pointer was huge and they are clearly more upwardly mobile right now than other teams around them in the table.",
      "Almost certainly not going down, and that is almost certainly enough for Farke.",
      "",
      "Might actually have made Wolves… okay? Certainly a lot less bad, anyway. It is still almost certainly too little, too late, but that’s also not really Rob Edwards’ fault either.",
      "The first win of the season was a cathartic dismantling of a doom-laden West Ham, and it didn’t come out of a clear blue sky either. There had been signs of life even in defeat at Arsenal and Liverpool, before running away giggling from Old Trafford with a point.",
      "After a draw at Everton and another at home to Newcastle, that run became six points from four games. That’s a pretty big deal when you only managed two from the previous 18 games.",
      "Have lost all their games since then, though. But they should still beat Derby’s infamous 11-point record – they have eight points with a guarantee of at least three more to come because they still have a game against Spurs in their locker – and after that Edwards’ primary role has always been about what happens next season rather than this.",
      "",
      "It was quite a 2025 for Nuno. He ended 2024 as our manager of the year; he ended 2025 looking in imminent danger of his second sacking of the season.",
      "Seven points from three games against Newcastle, Burnley and Bournemouth left things looking far comfier than might have been expected for a manager who, when the Magpies took an early lead at the London Stadium, looked to be heading for a second sack of the season long before the Christmas decorations went up.",
      "But quite why Nuno had to be so very Nuno in the way he, on the back of 3-1 and 3-2 wins and a 2-2 draw, decided to approach a home game against a Liverpool team that had just suffered three consecutive three-goal defeats, is puzzling, irritating and, above all, a reminder that he is here as a firefighter and that the marriage to a fanbase with limited patience for drab and functional let’s-not-get-relegated football is merely one of convenience.",
      "However, 2026 has seen another huge swing in Nuno’s fortunes. For neither the first nor last time, Tottenham came to the rescue. The momentum from a job-saving win at Spurs was parlayed into an even more impressive win over Sunderland and, despite the horrific late gut-punch, there was enough about the defeat at Chelsea to suggest the Hammers can at least drag some of the other stupid teams into the equation.",
      "Nuno and West Ham essentially relegated Burnley with a win at Turf Moor and suddenly, it’s not all so negative at the London Stadium where the delicious prospect grows of not only securing survival for themselves but relegating Tottenham in the process.",
      "",
      "A sacking remains out of the question despite continued (relative) struggles. There hasn’t been a Premier League manager since Fergie in his pomp with more credit in the bank than Pep.",
      "But is there still a distinct chance Guardiola decides he’s had enough and simply walks away? We reckon there is as they eye ‘two’ alternatives, and it’s always worth remembering that we’re talking Next Premier League Manager To Leave here, and that the traditional ‘Sack Race’ shorthand is a bit misleading.",
      "Somehow, despite themselves, City have managed to just about remain in the title race. But they are so unconvincing in how they’re going about it. If/when Arsenal do manage to make their superiority properly count in the league table, will Pep decide to sod it all for a game of soldiers? Possibly yes, but almost no chance that happens before at least one other team pulls the trigger.",
      "",
      "",
      "Definitely leaving at the end of the season, and very probably before that given the extent to which this relationship now appears to be breaking down. Palace are currently matching Spurs stride for pitiful stride in freefalling towards the trapdoor.",
      "He’s currently among the names being considered by Manchester United for the permanent manager’s job that is set to be available this summer. And that’s before we mention Liverpool and Spurs. He really does deserve a crack at a big job; it’s just a shame really that they are all, in their way, so very silly.",
      "But so too are Palace. They are without a win in 12 games – a run that even includes airily dismissing the help of Dr Tottenham – and have achieved an FA Cup first as a top-flight side in managing to be eliminated by a sixth-tier one. This is all either very bad or very clever timing, depending on how you view the desirability of those various Big Six options.",
      "The prospect of Glasner walking long before his contract expires sounds very real.",
      "",
      "A 4-1 thumping of Everton followed a simply huge and wildly unexpected win over Manchester City. Had Newcastle lost that, as all pre-interlull indications suggested they would, then the spotlight would have been harsh indeed on Howe and his team. They would at that point find themselves slap bang in the muck of a relegation scrap; instead they have lifted themselves back into the mid-table morass and – with absolutely nobody in there being actually any good at all – have now managed to get themselves right to the very top of it, firmly back into the Champions League equation, via nothing more complicated than three straight wins.",
      "The 4-3 victory over Leeds was admittedly quite complicated, but also just tremendously exciting. Pure Newcastle heritage. The drab 0-0 at Wolves, not so much, while a limp home defeat to Aston Villa had Howe once again under fire before a tame surrender at Liverpool. The home defeat to Brentford confirms Newcastle’s slump back into mid-table and has Howe under some notable pressure ahead of what looks like a timely appointment with Dr Tottenham in a fascinating clash between Spurs’ abysmal home form and Newcastle’s abysmal away form.",
      "",
      "Impossible to avoid the conclusion that Slot’s reaction to Liverpool’s mini-crisis becoming actual-crisis was poor. He went Full Klopp with his salty loser behaviour when Manchester United committed the crime of altering their tactics to give themselves the best chance of success against Liverpool, and the headloss continued after another chaotic and unstructured performance led to a 3-2 defeat at Brentford.",
      "Having ticked ‘opposition doing tactics wrong’ off his rattled manager bingo card, he can now add ‘losing his mind over entirely uncontroversial refereeing decisions’ with his response to both the Cody Gakpo non-penalty and Virgil van Dijk penalty at the Gtech.",
      "It has to be a worry for Liverpool that Slot has for the first time in his Anfield career found himself under any kind of pressure after a chastening run of defeats, and suffered severe and instant headloss as a result.",
      "Funny to think of a manager who’s beaten Real Madrid in the Champions League being under threat, but defeat at the Etihad was miserable before Nottingham Forest came along and achieved the amusing feat of being the first team to shut Liverpool out in the Premier League at Anfield since Nottingham Forest.",
      "And then there was a new nadir against PSV. That really was very, very bad. West Ham were wonderfully welcoming hosts on Sunday, but to such an inexplicable extent that it’s hard to know just how much to read into Liverpool’s 2-0 win at the London Stadium against opponents who were barely there. Predictably, they were poor in a 1-1 against proper team Sunderland and showed no backbone in the collapse at Leeds United, which was then followed by a distinctly unwelcome MO SALAH BOMBSHELL that does leave things looking distinctly like either he or the manager will have to go.",
      "A run of four consecutive wins cooled the immediate temperatures, but it all felt extremely precarious. The wins over Spurs and Wolves lacked any real authority. And then there were careless draws against Leeds and Fulham.",
      "There was another draw at Arsenal, though this was comfortably the most promising of their most recent stalemates. Still, this has not stopped Liverpool from coming up with a ‘contingency plan’, which might be enacted after drawing at home to Burnley and losing at Bournemouth.",
      "An impressive win over Newcastle eased the pressure, but that ludicrous conclusion to the Man City game puts Slot firmly back in the spotlight.",
      "",
      "Has done more than could ever have been expected given the chaos he walked into. That epic pants-pulling at Anfield and joyful spangling of Tottenham should be enough to buy any manager coming into a relegation-haunted club serious time.",
      "But Mr Marinakis’ lair is never a safe place for any manager to lurk, and there have been a pair of honking defeats against Everton and a weirdly rubbish performance against Brighton as well that will have had one of 2025’s key supervillains twitching over his big red sack button once more.",
      "Looked in very serious trouble when trailing at half-time against West Ham; Forest’s first win in a Premier League game they’d been losing at half-time since 1997 was enormously well timed. Going out of the FA Cup at Wrexham not so much.",
      "Victory at Brentford gave Forest and Dyche a bit of breathing space despite West Ham’s recent improvements, but it does look like we’ve got a multi-team battle to avoid one relegation spot and that is going to make everyone twitchy. Losing at Leeds a day before West Ham beat Burnley is not the best weekend.",
      "",
      "A big storyline this season has been teams carelessly succumbing to The Drift and slipping out the back of the big mid-table gang and into real trouble.",
      "Bournemouth have done it but turned it round. Tottenham have done it and are still in deep sh*t. Palace have done it and only begun the turnaround against newly-succumbing Brighton who are suddenly on a 12-game Premier League run where their only win was against Burnley at home.",
      "Their next four league games are against high-flying Villa, high-flying Brentford, a six-pointer against Forest, and table-toppers Arsenal. Hmm.",
      "",
      "Decision time for Burnley. There are two options available, and they prompt inevitable questions.",
      "Option one: Burnley decide to really try and beat relegation, and must decide whether they think Parker is the best man for that job.",
      "Option two: Burnley accept their overwhelmingly likely fate, and must decide whether Parker the best man to get them back up again.",
      "Parker’s job prospects likely rest on the decision. Because if it is indeed option two, he has a compelling case. Option one? He’s f*cked.",
      "But the longer he remains in place, the greater the chance that option two is the one. And right now he’s doing just enough to keep the wolves (literal and figurative) from the door.",
      "",
      "It would be a kindness now for all concerned to end this misery. The astonishing thing is not that Frank is favourite, but that he is still odds-against and that, in all likelihood, someone else will actually go before a man who is currently leading Spurs to relegation.",
      "There was some promise in the early weeks of his reign, but it has been obvious for months and months now that the Dane is out of his depth in every way for this job.",
      "He’s small-timing it on the field and in his press conferences. He’s mildly diverting in those pressers, but it doesn’t seem enough for the near-unanimous cover being provided for him by the media, who are making the exact excuses for Frank, whose PPG has now dropped below that of Jacques Santini and Jaunde Ramos, that they mocked Ange Postecoglou for attempting.",
      "It was all the way back in November during the harrowing NLD-PSG-Fulham week that Frank first really did look f*cked and it’s only been the occasional Champions League night since then when things have appeared unf*cked.",
      "Spurs were timid and abysmal in the North London Derby, the second big London derby in a row which Frank had approached more in the manner of a League One manager attempting to avoid a paddling in the FA Cup third round than a legitimate rival facing a familiar foe.",
      "There was some encouragement in a 5-3 Champions League defeat at PSG, but even the very fact it’s possible to write the words ‘some encouragement in a 5-3 Champions League defeat’ is in its own way damning.",
      "But at least those two defeats came against what genuinely might be the two best teams in Europe at that time. With all due respect to Fulham and the sterling work of Marco Silva in recent years, they are not one of the two best teams in Europe, and they were still much better than Spurs who torpedoed themselves inside the opening seven minutes to extend their extraordinarily – and in fairness largely pre-Frank – awful home record in the Premier League to three wins in 21 games since an increasingly odd-looking 4-1 win over Aston Villa in November last year.",
      "Frank’s response to the booing of Guglielmo Vicario after his hideous blunder was firmly in the ‘That’s true, but he shouldn’t say it’ category. And the way he went about it was all wrong.",
      "There should have been some acknowledgement that the booing of Vicario, unsavoury and unhelpful as it may have been, did not burst forth from a clear blue sky but instead a bubbling frustration from fans who pay among the highest ticket prices in the country to watch what is now among the worst and least effective football in the country.",
      "To instead label those supporters – and the boos did not come from a tiny minority inside the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium – not real Spurs fans was another gaffe that pushes the manager further towards the exit.",
      "Until that point we’d felt the obvious comparisons between Thomas Frank and Nuno Espirito Santo didn’t quite fit.",
      "But it’s very familiar now; the small-time approach to big games has not been well received and the fear grows that he just doesn’t understand what this job requires. The fact almost no manager in Premier League history has managed to understand what this job requires is cold comfort at this time.",
      "However, from there Spurs went to Newcastle and got a draw (albeit a ludicrous one) before they had a dominant 2-0 win against Frank’s old club Brentford, which everyone at Spurs sorely needed. It was easily their most convincing Premier League performance since the win at City on matchday two and a result that could have been even more compelling.",
      "They then pretty much secured a Champions League play-off round spot at the very least with a fine 3-0 win over Slavia Prague.",
      "But Spurs are Spurs, so they followed that with the worst performance yet of Frank’s reign in a truly inept and miserable 3-0 defeat at Nottingham Forest.",
      "Bringing Joao Palhinha and Ben Davies on to try and hold on to a 2-0 defeat and not even managing that feels uncomfortably like the infamous Nuno Moment against Manchester United.",
      "Have reached the kind of state where a dreadful home defeat to a very poor Liverpool is being dressed up as ‘signs of encouragement’. In reality, it might have been the worst possible result; still a defeat, yet one that extended the increasingly obviously doomed reign of the latest manager to be chewed up and spat out by the country’s most preposterous football club.",
      "The win at Palace was welcome if deeply unconvincing, while the sheer small-timery of a mind-meltingly dull goalless draw at Brentford really might have hurt Frank more than any of the many, many defeats. Or at least we thought that before they somehow contrived to Dr Tottenham their way to a 3-2 defeat at a Bournemouth side on a horrific streak while Frank was holding an Arsenal-branded cup.",
      "That and the fact the winning goal was scored by Antoine Semenyo with his last kick for Bournemouth before toddling off to pass the next two years on Man City’s bench were just the latest reminders that Spurs are a club where ridiculous things happen routinely, and that Frank simply isn’t and never will be capable of dealing with that.",
      "And in a strange way, that’s to his credit. It does look like Spurs are determined to try and muddle through the season with the obviously doomed Frank at the wheel, and in an odd way his immediate future might have more to do with West Ham than Spurs. It is West Ham’s (admittedly Spurs-assisted) resurgence and with it the very real danger of relegation that might finally get the Spurs board to see what has been alarmingly obvious to the fans for many weeks now.",
      "And yet… no. There is still no serious talk of Frank being sacked despite two wins in 16 Premier League games and the increasing if still inexplicably ignored reality of a relegation scrap for which they appear ill-equipped.",
      "The fact a draw at Burnley was good enough is damning. That got him another week, so it seems only fair that another draw against Man City gets him the rest of the season. Losing against an in-form Manchester United is also probably fine because Cristian Romero.",

      "Manchester United legend Gary Neville has revealed INEOS’ “official position” on whether to appoint interim boss Michael Carrick on a permanent basis.",
      "Carrick has been appointed on a deal until the end of this season after replacing former boss Ruben Amorim and has had a dream start.",
      "Under Carrick, Man Utd have won their last four Premier League games against Manchester City, Arsenal, Fulham and Tottenham Hotspur to boost their hopes of Champions League qualification.",
      "It was initially felt that Carrick would only be in charge until the summer, at which point the Red Devils would look to appoint an elite boss to oversee a long-term project.",
      "However, Carrick is doing his chances of earning the manager’s job permanently no harm at all and there is a growing clamour for him to be appointed.",
      "After Man Utd’s deserved 2-0 win against 10-man Spurs, Neville has revealed INEOS’ “official position” on making Carrick their next permanent manager.",
      "“I made my position clear a few weeks ago and what I’m not going to do is repeat it every week, but what I did, I actually spoke to the club, because ultimately the club get asked all the time from journalists and broadcasters, what’s the position of the club,” Neville said on The Gary Neville Podcast.",
      "READ: 16 Conclusions from Manchester United 2-0 Spurs: Frank sack, Romero sale, Carrick appointed",
      "“It’s a very difficult situation, you’ve got a massive movement now with what’s happened towards giving Carrick the job, saying that really he should be considered. That’s only going to build the more that he wins and the more that he gets closer to Champions League football.",
      "“I asked the club what is the official position of the football club in terms of what you’re saying publicly to everybody else. I have to say I thought their answer was pretty good. They said they’ve actually begun the process now, starting to look for another manager, which I thought right.",
      "“That’s good to hear because you need to plan for everything. They’ve started the process of speaking to and looking at other managers, building all the sorts of data and analysing who should be the next manager of the football club.",
      "“But what they’ve said is they’re not going to be bounced into – irrespective of wins or draws or losses on the pitch in this next couple of months – making an appointment. They’re going to wait until towards the end of the season.”",
      "Neville has also revealed what he thinks will happen if Carrick decides to make himself available to INEOS beyond this season.",
      "“If Michael then at that point makes himself available for the job, and I did actually say a couple of weeks ago, I wondered whether Michael actually would say no. He is that type of guy Michael, he’s someone who would always work in the best interest of the football club,” Neville added.",
      "“He may do that, or he might say no, I feel comfortable enough and I’ve built such a good relationship with the players, his coaching staff to put his name in the hat.",
      "“At that point Michael Carrick, like in any other recruitment role in the country for any other business, would go into what would be a process versus the likes of Thomas Tuchel and all the others that are going to become available in the summer. I think that’s fair.”",

      "Three teams have been picked for more Premier League TV games than Arsenal, Liverpool and Chelsea this season. Manchester United, obviously, but also…",
      "Premier League clubs received a total of £2.83billion last season, which was comprised of six payments through the division’s ‘central revenue system’, something the Premier League says ‘ensures the most equitable distribution of funds of any major European league’.",
      "Liverpool were paid £174.9m as champions – short of Manchester City’s record £176.2m in 2022/23 – while Newcastle received just over £160m to chuck into their PSR black hole.",
      "Southampton were handed £109.2m for their efforts in finishing a distant bottom. It pays to be in the Premier League.",
      "Some of those payments are fixed. All 20 clubs automatically receive around £96.9m through an equal share distributed based on both the domestic (£29.8m in 2024/25) and international (£59.2m in 2024/25) broadcast deals – those TV rights are lucrative for a reason – as well as £7.9m each from central commercial revenue streams.",
      "The rest is variable, based on where clubs finish and how often their games are selected for broadcast.",
      "",
      "The Premier League merit payments are distributed on a sliding scale from 1st to 20th, made up of combined earnings from domestic and international broadcast deals.",
      "For the 2024/25 season, the difference in prize money was around £2.7m per position. Southampton were given as much for finishing bottom, all the way up to champions Liverpool receiving £53.1m. It basically helped pay for 97.4% of Giorgi Mamardashvili and Jeremie Frimpong.",
      "That can be expected to fluctuate with inflation and other factors – it was around £2.8m per position in 2023/24 – but it offers a rough guide as to what clubs should expect to earn this season.",
      "",
      "1st (Arsenal) – £53.1m",

      "3rd (Aston Villa) – £47.7m",
      "4th (Manchester United) – £45m",

      "",
      "The only other part of the prize money which is not fixed and shared equally are the facility fees, which are based on how many times each club has been selected for television.",
      "In 2024/25, Liverpool had 30 games televised in the UK, for which they received £24.9m in facility fees. Arsenal had 29 matches and were paid £24.2m, while Manchester United (28 games for £23.4m), Aston Villa (27 games for £22.6m) and Chelsea (26 games for £21.8m) were televised frequently and rewarded handsomely.",
      "Ipswich were shown on the fewest occasions and received £8.9m in facility fees for their 10 live televised UK fixtures.",
      "This can lead to discrepancies in terms of those variable payments. Manchester United’s prize money after finishing 15th last season was £136.2m, more than the four clubs immediately above them – West Ham (£130.9m in 14th), Everton (£131.8m in 13th), Crystal Palace (£136.1m in 12th) and Fulham (£135.5m in 11th) – as Ruben Amorim’s side were picked for far more live TV games.",
      "Spurs were another massive outlier, earning more in 17th (£127.8m) than Wolves did in 16th (£123.1m) in part because they had nine more games picked for live UK broadcast.",

      "One big change in Premier League prize money going forward is that the 2025/26 season represents the start of a new four-year TV deal cycle.",
      "A new record £6.7bn domestic rights deal will see the number of live games rocket up to 267 of a possible 380, with every Premier League game outside the protected Saturday 3pm kick-offs to be broadcast live.",
      "Their packages include all Saturday 5.30pm, Sunday 2pm and Sunday 4.30pm kick-offs, plus Monday and Friday evening games and three midweek rounds.",
      "Overseas TV rights are worth more than £2bn per year to the Premier League with new deals signed with broadcasters in Japan and Mexico to go alongside lucrative packages in America, Scandinavia, Thailand, China, India and elsewhere.",
      "But the facility fee payments are tied to how many times a team is picked for broadcast by Sky and TNT, with both broadcasters having made their picks up to before Boxing Day. One game generally translates to roughly £0.83m but does fluctuate.",
      "Brentford, Chelsea, Everton, Liverpool, Newcastle and Spurs were the biggest winners from the latest round of picks up to March 22 with three more games each.",
      "Aston Villa, Burnley, Crystal Palace and Fulham were only selected once more – on the March midweek when every team will be televised.",
      "1st) Manchester United (26 games televised live in the UK) – worth around £21.8m in 2024/25",
      "=2nd) Newcastle and Spurs (25 games) – worth around £20.9m",

      "According to a report from Calciomercato, AC Milan are preparing to reshape their squad at the end of the season, and Pulisic is among the players whose future is now under discussion as part of that process.",
      "The winger has re-established himself since leaving England and remains a regular for Milan, but reports from Italy suggest the club would consider a sale in the region of €55m if the right offer arrives.",
      "That valuation has not gone unnoticed among Premier League clubs, where Pulisic’s situation is being tracked as clubs weigh up attacking options ahead of the next window.",
      "Pulisic has scored 10 goals this season and featured prominently in Milan’s Champions League campaign, with his form in Serie A restoring his standing after a mixed spell earlier in his career.",
      "His potential availability is less a reflection of output and more tied to Milan’s wider planning. Milan are understood to be open to moving on valuable assets if it allows them to refresh the squad and rebalance their structure.",
      "Interest is building from England, with Arsenal, Tottenham, and Manchester United all monitoring the situation as Milan weigh their options.",
      "Arsenal would need to decide whether he fits as a rotation option or a genuine challenger in wide areas.",
      "Tottenham are evidently the shortest on quality in attacking areas, while Man United’s interest may be complicated by recent recruitment in attacking roles.",
      "United spent big on Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo last summer, with a view to raising the level of the starting XI. Any new arrival this coming summer would face stiff competition.",
      "On the other hand, a recent shift to a 4-2-3-1 under Michael Carrick could facilitate Pulisic playing on the right of an attacking three featuring Cunha and Mbeumo.",
      "Arsenal look well subscribed in wide areas, with Eberechi Eze, Gabriel Martinelli, Leandro Trossard, and Noni Madueke all capable of featuring on the wings.",
      "Their North London neighbours, Tottenham, however, look light. Destiny Udogie and Archie Gray operated as wing-backs in a 2-0 defeat to Man Utd at the weekend.",

      "Italian media have found a new folk hero in Scott McTominay, with the former Manchester United midfielder earning a level of reverence rarely afforded to imports in Serie A.",
      "The reaction followed Napoli’s chaotic 3-2 win over Genoa, a game that once again placed McTominay at the centre of everything, even though his involvement lasted just 45 minutes.",
      "McTominay scored a superb long-range goal, helped spark Napoli’s equaliser and then spent the second half watching from the sidelines after being withdrawn with an injury that has troubled him for weeks.",
      "Despite his goal contributions, McTominay’s influence is largely measured in character, resilience and presence.",
      "His continued influence has reportedly earned him sit-down talks with Napoli to discuss extending his contract to 2030, though he was recently linked with a return to Old Trafford.",
      "McTominay joined Man Utd’s academy at the age of five, rose through the ranks and spent seven years in the first-team squad, often filling gaps rather than being built around.",
      "Across 178 Premier League appearances for United, he scored 19 league goals and was regularly used in multiple roles, including spells further forward when the squad lacked options.",
      "The shift has been stark since his £25.7m move to Napoli in August 2024. Under Antonio Conte, McTominay has become a core figure, contributing goals, physical authority and leadership.",
      "But he’s also being managed carefully by the former Chelsea and Tottenham boss.",
      "McTominay’s weekend goal against Genoa proved decisive, yet Conte opted to remove him at half-time.",
      "Il Napolista praised McTominay’s contribution to Napoli’s opener and described his performance as “a magnificent moral brace”, before signing off its assessment with the line: “God save Scott McTominay.”",
      "Corriere dello Sport struck a similar tone, awarding him an eight out of ten and summing up his appeal simply: “When the going gets tough, he’s always the toughest.”",
      "His goal was labelled “beautiful”, while his display was described as “exceptional”, adding that he continued to “shoot, run and fight like hell”, earning him the tag “the Rocky of football”.",
      "After the game, Conte explained the decision in full. “Scott has been dealing with this problem since the beginning of the year,” he said.",
      "“It’s an inflammation of the tendons in the area between the gluteus maximus and the hamstrings. This discomfort forces him to play at a reduced pace.",
      "“He would have continued, but at the end of the first half I preferred to avoid any stupid risks. We’re talking about a key player for us, I need him to be 100%. We hope to get him back as soon as possible.”",
      "Since arriving in Naples, he has delivered 18 Serie A goals across two seasons, helped Napoli lift the Supercoppa Italiana in December and established himself as one of Conte’s most trusted players.",

      "Owen Hargreaves might be getting ahead of himself a touch as the former Manchester United midfielder claims the Red Devils have their own Mohamed Salah and a new George Best to dovetail with their “ridiculous” teammate.",

      "The latest victory came over Tottenham as goals from Bryan Mbeumo and Bruno Fernandes ensured the 2-0 win after Spurs captain Cristian Romero gave them a huge helping hand after being sent off for a studs-up challenge on Casemiro.",
      "Fernandes’ late goal took the United captain to 200 goal contributions in just 314 Premier League appearances, which makes him the second-fastest player to reach the milestone after Wayne Rooney.",
      "And Hargreaves hailed the skipper for what he insists are “Playstation numbers”.",
      "“He plays with risk but it’s risk that the team benefits from.",
      "“Kobbie [Mainoo] in behind was fantastic again and Casemiro… those three were probably the three best players in the game, in my opinion.",
      "“We said beforehand, under Ruben Amorim, that midfield was a weakness but that midfield three is really good.",

      "“I’ve never watched Kobbie play and he’s not played like that. I’ve never seen him have a bad game.",
      "“I can’t believe how talented the kid is. This club is all about producing academy players and he is a fantastic one.",
      "“When you think about the days of George Best coming through playing with flair and with risk, Kobbie is that type of player.",
      "“He takes the ball at any point and you can pass it to him anywhere on the pitch and he looks like he’s playing the park with his mates.",
      "“It’s a credit to him. He is so comfortable on the ball and he is so humble. He’s going to be a really special player.”",
      "Mbeumo scored his third goal in four appearances under Carrick, picking out the corner after a clever corner routine involving Fernandes and Mainoo to make it ten goals in 21 appearances for the season.",
      "He operated almost exclusively on the right flank under Amorim but has started down the middle under Carrick at the expense of Benjamin Sesko, and Hargreaves believes he has similar qualities to Liverpool hero Mo Salah.",
      "“He’s 26, he can deliver, he’s just got it,” Hargreaves added.",
      "“He is a great finisher, I said this a little earlier in the season but he reminds me of Mo Salah. He is a good finisher when he is in those areas, he doesn’t get too up and doesn’t get too down which I think is a brilliant attribute.”",
      "Arsenal legend David Seaman was “shocked” by Mikel Arteta’s decision to bring off Martin Odegaard in the Gunners’ 3-2 loss to Manchester United on Sunday.",

      "“No, I wouldn’t give it to him right now. I know Michael, played with him for many years, grew up at West Ham with him, was one of his good mates within the United team, but I can sit here comfortably and say I don’t think he should be given the job right now.",
      "“Let him go through to the end of the season, get to the end of the season then take stock and make a decision.",

      "Manchester United continue to find beauty in simplicity under Michael Carrick, but Thomas Frank and Cristian Romero surely cannot carry on at Spurs.",
      "The Spurs hoodoo is over and Manchester United have a firm grip on Champions League qualification.",
      "But what of Frank and Romero’s futures in north London? It’s not looking great.",
      "",
      "1) Prepare yourselves for three days of the most wild and tiresome haircut discourse involving Manchester United since Garth Crooks conquered his Paul Pogba obsession.",
      "",
      "2) That is testament to the impact of Michael Carrick, whose simplification of a seemingly maddening equation continues to impress.",
      "There are no square pegs in round holes, no-one crowbarred in with the system given precedence to the players. They have a sturdy defence, a reliable midfield and a productive attack, all being asked to do relatively straightforward things in front of a competent keeper.",
      "They have had the composite parts to do this all season, but a coach who specifically chose not to. And that will never not be funny.",
      "Yet even then, Darren Fletcher struggled to make sense of it in his winless pair of games, so Carrick deserves the utmost credit. Unfortunately, so do the bumbling suits who appointed him.",
      "",
      "3) It is the first time since February 2024 that Manchester United have won four consecutive Premier League games. The scorers in a run which saw Wolves, West Ham, Aston Villa and Luton all vanquished were Marcus Rashford, Rasmus Hojlund, Scott McTominay, Alejandro Garnacho and Kobbie Mainoo.",
      "More of them play for Napoli two years later than for Manchester United.",
      "If Ruben Amorim had seen out January then Barcelona and Chelsea would have possessed more of those players than the Red Devils too.",
      "But the Portuguese had to be sacked as much to release Mainoo from his baffling prison as to rescue the club’s performances, results and dignity.",
      "Mainoo was brilliant again, creating more chances than any player bar the absurd Bruno Fernandes, having more touches than any player aside from the Butt and Scholes-silencing Lisandro Martinez, and just generally patrolling midfield with a quiet authority.",
      "It is difficult not to watch him excel in a midfield two without wondering what the f*** the previous manager was thinking.",
      "",
      "4) It is even tougher to watch Cristian Romero without wondering what the f*** he is thinking – even when his latest case of avoidable and self-destructive head loss is so predictable.",
      "",
      "5) But it is very Spurs for their captain to rant on social media about their ‘unbelievable but true and disgraceful’ lack of available players, before proceeding to get sent off not even half an hour into their next fixture when the game was in the balance and the visitors had acquitted themselves well at Old Trafford.",
      "He might struggle blaming the Lewis family for his upcoming four-match suspension, including a potentially ruinous north London derby.",
      "Romero has long since been a liability and as justifiable as he and many others may feel his pop at the board was for the lack of January reinforcements to a threadbare squad, his words are frequently undermined by his actions.",
      "And they make him far from irreplaceable. Spurs are not blessed with many particularly saleable assets, or at least players who can command a worthwhile enough fee to cash in on without the entire team falling in on itself.",
      "Romero’s cons far outweigh his positives at this point; there are cheaper players out there whose ceilings might be lower, but at least their floors aren’t made of infuriating lava.",
      "Spurs need reliability at this stage and their captain guarantees the opposite.",
      "",
      "6) Thomas Frank was never likely to enter his post-match media duties holding aloft a bloody captain’s band on the disembodied arm of Romero. But of course he basically absolved the Argentinean of blame and insisted there were “no regrets” about making giving someone so consistently reckless and daft a leadership role.",
      "“He’s apologised to his team-mates in the changing room. I think he’s one of the most important players,” Frank said, adding that “Cuti clearly tried to go for the ball. Unfortunately, the way the rules is, it’s then a red”.",
      "That argument might wash in ordinary circumstances, but not when discussing someone who has been sent off more times than any other Premier League player in all competitions since making his debut.",
      "It had far less to do with “the way the rules is”, and far more to do with a player who routinely breaks them and faces barely any consequence for doing so.",
      "Again, Frank’s hands are tied slightly in terms of how he handles it publicly, but it is tough to envisage him coming down much harder on Romero behind the scenes. The controversy earlier in the week was “dealt with internally” and this felt like a child testing the boundaries of a weak parent even further to see what they can get away with.",
      "",
      "7) And this press conference exchange after the defeat is exceptional.",
      "Journalist: “It’s Romero’s fourth suspension of the season, you’ll lose him for four games and he’s close to a fifth suspension for yellow cards, how do you take out the recklessness while keeping the aggression?”",
      "Frank: “I think if you look at how many red cards he has had, it’s not like he had that many throughout his career. You know, you play with passion and you play with aggression. And there’s a fine line when you do that.”",
      "Journalist: “He’s got the most red cards of all Premier League players since he arrived at the club.”",
      "Frank: “At the club? Yeah, but not in the Premier League.”",
      "Journalist: “Of all Premier League players, I think.”",
      "Frank: “Of Premier League players? OK, I didn’t know that.”",
      "He does himself precisely no favours.",
      "",
      "8) It changed the game. The shot count was seven to five in favour of the hosts by that point, with possession roughly equal and no clear better team emerging.",
      "Spurs did not have another effort on goal until Xavi Simons whistled one just wide in the 57th minute – from a poor Luke Shaw pass with no team-mate within 20 yards of the Dutchman – and were a goal down soon after.",
      "Yet only a clever set-piece routine broke down that Spurs low block before they felt compelled to open up and try to nick one on the counter in the final ten minutes.",
      "Bruno Fernandes’ short corner found an intelligent Mainoo run parallel to the front post, with his pass around the shoulder seeking out Bryan Mbeumo on the edge of the area. The placed finish perfectly matched the two balls which preceded it.",
      "It wasn’t Arsenal scoring from a header so there need be no crisis declared about the state of the sport. But it was wonderful, and further proof that the most effective way of breaching a defence lies in those moves which can be devised and perfected to mimic actual in-game situations most accurately on the training ground, and are almost certain to happen a handful of times across any match.",
      "It is a damning indictment on any team which chooses not to try and maximise them.",
      "",
      "9) There is some sympathy for Frank, who was let down so thoroughly by his captain after half an hour, then made a triple substitution to bring on two forwards and a Yves Bissouma for the final ten minutes, before conceding a second almost instantly.",
      "Mathys Tel even ranked joint-second for dribbles behind Simons, while conjuring up only Spurs’ second shot with ten men in the fifth minute of stoppage time.",
      "They had a man advantage for an hour and were playing at home to relegation fodder but Manchester United seeing that result out so smoothly felt deeply unsettling. It is only 75 days since they lost in similar conditions.",
      "",
      "10) Frank might even try and spin some vindication from this, considering known transfer target and former Brentford favourite Mbeumo has scored against Spurs home and away while thriving on a bigger stage.",
      "Antoine Semenyo is another who got away – having never felt particularly close. They are flourishing but have also been given the platform and framework in which to do so; Spurs have neither that attacking structure nor individual quality currently.",
      "",
      "11) The game state was obviously skewed but this was Carrick’s first win as a Premier League manager with more than 50 per cent possession. He has overseen two bouts of late drama against Arsenal and Fulham, a deserved rope-a-dope victory over Manchester City and now a consummately professional dispatching of Spurs.",
      "Long may it continue, if only to force Gary Neville and Roy Keane down from such stupidly definitive stances.",
      "",
      "12) Souza seemed bright on his Premier League debut, despite the slightly sub-optimal circumstances. He will have to be, considering Destiny Udogie succumbed to injury and joined Djed Spence on the sidelines to further deplete Spurs’ stock of left-backs.",
      "He should do well in the Championship anyway.",
      "",
      "13) Frank has not reached for the ‘Spurs finished 17th last season’ button for some time, perhaps realising the futility when he has them in 14th and can hardly recycle domestic failure into European glory the same way Ange Postecoglou did.",
      "But this is a relegation battle. Spurs are level on points with Crystal Palace and Leeds, three clear of Nottingham Forest and only six above West Ham. They cannot win at home, have not won in the league this year, and neither their manager nor the players seem to possess the mentality or skillset necessary for what lies ahead.",
      "Even in keeping Brentford up – a remarkable achievement, to be sure – Frank never really had them in a position of genuine danger. The Bees never ended a single Premier League matchday in a position lower than 16th under him; Spurs are spiralling that far down and very possibly further.",
      "",
      "14) Fernandes is an interesting case study to consider when it comes to Romero.",
      "There have been at least a couple of calls for the Portuguese to be stripped of the Manchester United captaincy over the years. His petulance can be enraging and his demeanour exasperating.",
      "Fernandes became a burden last season with three red cards, including in a defeat to Spurs.",
      "Yet he has been phenomenal for months and, really, with a handful of exceptions, years. He will still self-sabotage at times – although that tendency has certainly been less prevalent of late – but what he brings to the team far outstrips what he is capable of taking away.",
      "His finish to make it 2-0 and end the game as a contest was glorious improvisation from a player at his peak. Fernandes has six goals and 13 assists this season, and tore Spurs to shreds with eight shots and six key passes here – the most by a player in a single Premier League game since October 2024.",
      "",
      "15) As far as rallying cries go, “We can’t run away from [the fact] we haven’t won enough in the Premier League. But there is no other alternative than keep going, which we will do, of course,” is a generational effort from Frank.",
      "They host Newcastle on Tuesday, a team almost as awful away as Spurs are at home in a true meeting of resistible force and moveable object.",
      "Then after that it’s Arsenal, and the prospect of the Gunners celebrating another victory en route to the Premier League title with a 90-minute chant of “Arsenal boys, we’re on a bender, Thomas Frank is a silver member”.",
      "Sacking him before then won’t stop that, but it might be the kindest thing to do.",
      "",
      "16) Manchester United have lost one of their last 13 Premier League games and are three points off title challengers Aston Villa. What an absurd season they have had.",
      "Leeds Under The Lights might be the greatest team in Premier League history – Daniel Farke is contemplating petitioning for a rule change.",
      "‘How bizarre fixture quirk could see Arsenal and Man City face each other FIVE TIMES in one month’ as Gary Neville exposes a conspiracy.",
      "Brighton have spent too much money under Fabian Hurzeler for the captain to give history lessons and the chief executive to lament ‘growing fan impatience’.",
      "Thomas Frank has clung on to his Spurs job through several awful defeats, so we’re shocked he’s favourite after West Ham relegated Scott Parker’s Burnley.",
      "Manchester United legend Wayne Rooney thinks Tottenham Hotspur are “definitely” in a “relegation battle”, while he has offered his thoughts on Thomas Frank.",
      "Bukayo Saka somehow remains in the Premier League XI of the season so far, which doesn’t say a lot for the opposition."

      "Manchester United vs Tottenham Hotspur is a ‘clash between the two stupidest big Premier League clubs over the last couple of years’, and it is always ‘almost guaranteed to be absurd’.",
      "This makes this fixture incredibly difficult to forecast, but our Dave Tickner calling a red card for Cristian Romero was his safest of his ten pre-match predictions.",
      "Following his full-blooded challenge on Tottenham’s board due to their lack of January transfer business, Romero was equally as committed with his needless follow-through on Casemiro to be sent off inside half an hour against Man Utd.",
      "It was as utterly idiotic as expected from a player who cannot be trusted to lead this broken Spurs ship without having a brainless act of his own to sink them further.",
      "Before Romero’s latest calamitous moment, Spurs were actually a match for Man Utd as the two sides exchanged good chances, but the hosts took control thereafter.",
      "There was more evidence of United’s defensive shakiness displayed against Fulham here, but everyone associated with the Red Devils will happily accept having that weakness because their fabled DNA has finally come to the fore again.",
      "READ: Is Man Utd ‘no d**kheads’ policy finally reaping rewards?",
      "In his brief time in charge, interim manager Michael Carrick has been faultless as Man Utd deservedly won four straight Premier League games (supporter Frank Ilett is so close to having that haircut) against Manchester City, Arsenal, Fulham and now Spurs via performances that have been a throwback to the United of old.",
      "But Carrick has been dealt a very good hand by INEOS, which is mainly because former boss Ruben Amorim took them so far away from their deep-rooted principles that only a few simple decisions were needed to spark an immediate upturn.",
      "This has mainly been the long-awaited recall of Kobbie Mainoo, who has remarkably taken no time to return to his masterful best despite his long exile, the switch to a four-man defence and a notable increase in United’s intensity both in and out of possession.",
      "Man Utd are obviously lacking in certain positions that will be addressed in the summer, but there was always the feeling that this group of players is capable of much more than was shown under Amorim, and recent showings have underlined that view.",
      "This was certainly not the best of United’s recent performances, but they were still far too much for Spurs in their current sorry form under Thomas Frank and could have won by a significant scoreline had they not played with their food.",
      "United took the lead only nine minutes after Romero’s dismissal, with summer signing Bryan Mbeumo scoring his ninth Premier League goal of the season via one of those straight off the training ground corners that are always very satisfying when they come off.",
      "One of the many negative hallmarks of Amorim’s reign was Man Utd’s wastefulness as they often missed big chances to improve their Champions League hopes, and they ran the risk of falling into this trap against Spurs as the scoreline remained 1-0 heading into the closing stages.",
      "But it also felt inevitable that Spurs would have been picked off at some stage and United’s second goal came almost instantly after Frank made an attacking triple change for the final ten minutes.",
      "Just as Mainoo has been a revelation alongside revitalised Casemiro in centre-midfield, the same can be said for Fernandes, who has unsurprisingly been far more influential since returning to his favoured advanced role under Carrick.",
      "He has often been the provider in recent matches, but he converted a chance for United’s second against Spurs as he deftly converted a brilliant cross from Diogo Dalot. It is now even clearer than it was before that the Red Devils cannot sacrifice their captain in a summer rebuild; he’s simply too influential to be let go.",
      "Fernandes and Mainoo may well end up contributing to Carrick landing the Man Utd job permanently in the summer, with the win against Spurs adding to the feeling that INEOS will be put in an impossible and familiar position regarding their next permanent manager appointment.",

      "Michael Carrick has overseen victories in his first four games as Man Utd boss, rejuvenating the club after Ruben Amorim's exit; Ole Gunnar Solskjaer also made a winning start in 2018, with similarities between their approach to restore confidence and United's traditional style of play",
      "Monday 9 February 2026 10:11, UK",
      "It's four from four for Michael Carrick, Man Utd are rejuvenated and the similarities with Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's instant impact in 2018 are striking.",
      "Carrick first had a taste of managing United as a caretaker following Solskjaer's exit in 2021 and any scepticism about his long-term suitability for the role is wedded to how it unravelled for the former super sub who couldn't sustain his stunning start.",
      "But Old Trafford is buzzing again and there's no doubt Carrick has recaptured that flow, feeling and freedom United enjoyed at the beginning of Solskjaer's tenure in 2018/19, when the Norwegian took the wheel.",
      "Goals are flying in, an unshackled No 10 is pulling the strings, and refound confidence is coursing through the team with a sense the traditional style of play at Man Utd has been reclaimed.",
      "Carrick's United have scored 10 in his four games in charge, having managed just one per game in Amorim's final four. That's shy of Solskjaer's total at the start of his interim spell but the calibre of opponent has been trickier and they could easily have had more, against City in particular.",
      "\"After the negative performances under Jose Mourinho, Solskjaer seemed to give his players a freedom to express themselves\" we wrote on these pages in 2018, when United thumped Cardiff 5-1 in Solskjaer's first game.",
      "The same sentiment applies to Carrick's United - a gameplan simplified yet, as he said himself, a team \"playing with purpose\".",
      "And the creator in chief? Back in 2018 it was Paul Pogba in the No 10. So often the scapegoat during the Mourinho era, who made headlines with a famously frosty training ground greeting with his manager, under Solskjaer Pogba was renewed.",
      "His four goal involvements in Solskjaer's first two games was as many as he'd managed in Mourinho's final 12 matches. His four goals across Solskjaer's games two and three were as many as he'd scored in Mourinho's final 20.",
      "Bruno Fernandes' output has been impressive throughout the season, especially given United's struggles under Amorim. But he too is now playing with added verve, restored to a No 10 role from a deeper position thanks to Carrick's tactical shake-up.",
      "It's four assists and a goal from four games under Carrick for Fernandes. \"Carrick came in with the right ideas, giving the players the responsibility and freedom on the pitch,\" was the United captain's assessment after adding the second to seal the win against Spurs on Saturday.",
      "That goal was from a fantastic Diogo Dalot cross but against City and at Arsenal United have also been excellent on the break. It has been high-energy, intense and end-to-end. A throwback, an echo of the glory days under Sir Alex Ferguson - who managed and inspired both Solskjaer and Carrick.",
      "\"We've been conditioned to believe you cannot play like Manchester United play,\" Neville said after that derby triumph. \"That's what I've been told for the last three, four, five years, 'move on, you can't play that way anymore'.",
      "\"You've just watched 90 minutes of exactly what I think this club plays like when it's actually at its very best.\"",
      "In another nod to the grand traditions of the club, Solskjaer became the first United manager since Sir Matt Busby to win his first four in charge. Now in his permanent role, Carrick has repeated the streak.",
      "But what comes next?",
      "Solskjaer went on to win his first six Premier League games on the spin and with West Ham and Everton next, Carrick could emulate that. Matching Solskjaer's return of 14 wins from his first 19 really would be some going.",
      "But infamously, after signing his contract for the permanent post, Solskjaer oversaw just two wins out of the remaining 10 games that season.",
      "Roy Keane's recent comment that Carrick shouldn't be appointed even if he wins every game until the end of this campaign sparked debate but is a reflection of the scars from Solskjaer's appointment and how he proved not to be the answer in the long run.",
      "\"They need a bigger and better manager,\" said Keane after the victory at Arsenal. \"The size of the club and the challenges they face over the next few years, you want a manager who you feel can get them winning league titles.\"",
      "Solskjaer did go on to achieve two high league finishes and lost a Europa League final on penalties but couldn't attain the titles ultimately expected from the hierarchy after heavy transfer market investment in the squad.",
      "Carrick has made a similar start to Solskjaer but is a club which has experienced multiple false dawns since Sir Alex Ferguson's retirement now seeing the foundations created for substantial long-term success?",
      "The arguments about whether Carrick can take the team to the next level will run through the final months of the season to the end of his current deal in the summer, when United will be weighing up their alternatives. But no doubt, Carrick has hit the ground running and raised expectations again at Old Trafford.",

      "Kobbie Mainoo's impressive return to the Manchester United team shows what Ruben Amorim was missing. Also in The Debrief: More Bruno Fernandes numbers, Bernardo Silva's influential display, Enzo Fernandez's 'new' position and Angel Gomes' debut",
      "Monday 9 February 2026 11:45, UK",
      "The questions about Kobbie Mainoo had become a running joke of press conferences under Ruben Amorim. It was clear that the former Manchester United boss was less than convinced that the young midfielder was worth all the fuss. But Amorim was wrong.",
      "Having not been trusted with a single Premier League start prior to Michael Carrick's arrival, Mainoo has been picked four times out of four under him and United have won the lot. Beat West Ham on Tuesday and a certain supporter can finally have his hair cut.",
      "The partnership with Casemiro, one that Amorim sensed was not feasible, has been impressive in of itself let alone the fact that the formation change has freed up Bruno Fernandes to flourish in his favoured position. Mainoo has slotted in there seamlessly.",
      "The youngster deserves credit for getting up to speed so quickly given that he had been so starved of minutes. The balance he brings the team is one thing, the boost it brings for fans to see an academy graduate is another. But fundamentally he is just a fine footballer.",
      "Against Tottenham, Mainoo completed 33 passes in the final third of the pitch, 12 more than he ever had in a Premier League game before. That was also the most by anyone on the pitch and the most by any player in the competition over the course of the weekend.",
      "Casemiro was not far behind, the pair described as \"a big part of controlling the team\" by Carrick. It helped that Spurs were down to 10 but when Carrick talked recently of liking \"the way Kobbie takes the ball\" and calling him \"a joy to watch\" it is easy to see why.",
      "\"Credit to him, he has come right in and found his rhythm, which is not easy after a period of time out. We know he can handle the ball and hopefully over time, I am sure he will keep improving. We have got to be patient and not expect too much from him all the time.\"",
      "Mainoo, still only 20 years old, was in danger of becoming a talent lost to United had the previous regime been allowed to continue much longer. Instead, Carrick has helped him to remind people of his quality. Perhaps he could have been useful to Amorim, after all.",
      "Regular readers of this column will know there is a risk of it becoming devoted to the boy Fernandes. But such are his statistical accomplishments, it is difficult to ignore the Portuguese playmaker. He was at it again in Manchester United's win over Tottenham.",
      "Fernandes scored United's second goal and had six shots from outside the box but his creative contribution stood out once more. Fernandes should have had another assist with his final kick of the game when the unmarked Benjamin Sesko misdirected his header.",
      "That was the sixth chance created by the United captain, the most of any player over the Premier League weekend. It is the third time this season that Fernandes has created six chances in a game. Rayan Cherki is the only other man to have done that even twice.",
      "Two of the three matches in which Fernandes has created that many chances have come under Carrick and that should be no surprise. He has been restored to his best position, playing in the fun part of the football pitch, making things happen for his team.",
      "In truth, even under Ruben Amorim, he was putting up spectacular numbers. He has created 74 chances this season when nobody else in the Premier League has brought up their half century yet. It is 200 United goal involvements in all competition for him now.",
      "Fernandes remains a polarising figure, routinely given the treatment by opposition supporters. Even some United fans speculate that he might be part of the problem rather than the solution given that his time at the club has coincided with their struggles.",
      "That talk should stop. Fernandes has been a victim of United's malaise. While their 16th-place finish last season was a little artificial given their resources, if he propels them into the Champions League, he has a persuasive case to be named as the player of the year.",
      "Pep Guardiola is rarely shy to laud his players but the smile beams a little wider where Bernardo Silva is concerned, the player whom he has picked more times than any other outfield player during his managerial career. He delivered again for him at Anfield.",
      "While Erling Haaland scored the winning goal in Manchester City's come-from-behind victory over Liverpool, Guardiola had been unimpressed with the big striker's efforts for much of the second half, gesticulating at him and wanting much better body language.",
      "\"I know it's an incredibly difficult task [for Haaland and Omar Marmoush against Ibrahima] Konate and [Virgil] van Dijk, to win those balls, but in the second half [they did] not even try,\" claimed Guardiola. \"That ball goes quick, it comes back quicker.\"",
      "It was Bernardo who drove City on to victory, not just with his equalising goal but his whole demeanour. While others were wilting, shoulders hunched and belief sapped, he sensed the moment. He was the inspiration to his teammates - and his own coach.",
      "\"Guided by our incredible player, one of the best players I ever trained, our captain Bernardo, we followed him. I follow him too. Because when a player always puts the team in front of himself and does things through example, everybody follows him.\"",
      "Bernardo completed more passes in the final third than anyone else on the pitch but, now playing in a deeper role, he has shown that the location of his work is less significant than his presence. Guardiola still wants his man out there setting standards.",
      "The City boss said recently that he would love Bernardo to stay and that whatever happens this season his legacy at the club is secure. But don't rule out more glory just yet. \"We will fight to the end,\" said Bernardo himself afterwards. He always does.",
      "With eight goals in 24 Premier League games this season, Enzo Fernandez is only one behind Joao Pedro as Chelsea's top scorer in the competition. But the Argentina international was moved to the left to accommodate Cole Palmer in the win at Wolves.",
      "At least that is what the team graphics showed. Liam Rosenior rejected that argument when discussing Fernandez's positioning in the press conference following the 3-1 victory in which Palmer scored a first-half hat trick. \"It's amazing,\" said Rosenior.",
      "\"Enzo is playing in exactly the same position he has been playing in probably 80 to 90 per cent of the season, which is in the left pocket. That is where he plays. Actually, he has got more freedom because we're interchanging a little bit more from our structure.\"",
      "\"Without the ball, he is on the left. That is probably why it looks different today because of the way Wolves play. He has not changed his position, to be honest. It looks that way, but his position in possession is the same.\" The touch map illustrates this point.",
      "It was Marc Cucurella who provided the assist for Chelsea's excellent third goal - a move that started with goalkeeper Robert Sanchez - and it was the left-back who offered width on that flank. No Chelsea player had more touches in the opposition box than Cucurella.",
      "Fernandez was free to roam into more central zones, having three shots of his own, including an ambitious rabona attempt that would have been the goal of the Premier League weekend. He had more final third entries than any other player on the pitch.",
      "With Pedro Neto staying wide on the right, Fernandez was often alongside Palmer, the pair operating in the pockets. While his duties shifted a little out of possession, on the ball it seems this might be the way for Rosenior to get his best players in the best areas.",
      "Angel Gomes' loan move to Wolves was a surprising one. The midfielder made four appearances for England as recently as 2024 and has an intriguing profile. Leaving Marseille for a team doomed to relegation from the Premier League raised eyebrows.",
      "But this is an opportunity to show what he can do in English football, a first Premier League start at the age of 25 after five substitute appearances for Manchester United in the competition as a teenager. It was a promising debut even in defeat against Chelsea.",
      "The quality of his work in possession was certainly an upgrade on those around him at Molineux. He was the only Wolves starter to win possession more times than he lost it. His passing accuracy was 94.3 per cent, while no other Wolves starter hit 90 per cent.",
      "But what was particularly impressive about the playmaker was that these numbers did not stem from him playing safe, he was progressive in his use of the ball too. Asking Rob Edwards about that in the press conference, he identified it as Gomes' key strength.",
      "\"That was the reason for him coming in. I think he can link, obviously, as a six and give us something in the build-up but once he gets turned and is facing up as well, hopefully then he has got more of a killer pass, maybe something that we have not quite had.",
      "\"You saw a little bit of that today, didn't you. He has got that nice sort of spinning one, where he is seeing those runs. He has got those forward passes in the locker and hopefully we will see a lot more of it now, the fitter and the more integrated he gets.\"",
      "Gomes went off with cramp late on, an indication that the physical challenge of the Premier League will be tough after four-and-a-half seasons in France. But his touch gave him time on the ball against tough opposition. Wolves will not be staying up. He just might.",

      "Gary Neville on Man Utd potentially appointing Michael Carrick: \"What United have said is they're not going to be bounced into, irrespective of wins or draws or losses on the pitch in this next couple of months, making an appointment. They're going to wait until the end of the season\"",
      "Sunday 8 February 2026 21:25, UK",
      "Gary Neville says Manchester United will not be \"bounced\" into making a decision to give Michael Carrick the manager's job after a run of great results.",
      "Carrick masterminded a fourth-straight United victory as his side secured a 2-0 Premier League triumph over 10-man Tottenham on Saturday.",
      "The win moved United to within three points of third-placed Aston Villa in the race for Champions League qualification.",
      "It also took Carrick's overall record as boss at Old Trafford to six wins in seven matches, including a three-game spell in 2021, but as the clamour builds in favour of giving him the job beyond the end of the season, Neville warned United will not be rushed into a decision.",
      "He told The Gary Neville Podcast: \"I made my position clear a few weeks ago and what I'm not going to do is repeat it every week, but what I did, I actually spoke to the club, because ultimately the club get asked all the time from journalists and broadcasters, what's the position of the club.",
      "\"It's a very difficult situation, you've got a massive movement now with what's happened towards giving Carrick the job, saying that really he should be considered.That's only going to build the more that he wins and the more that he gets closer to Champions League football.",
      "\"I asked the club what is the official position of the football club in terms of what you're saying publicly to everybody else. I have to say I thought their answer was pretty good. They said they've actually begun the process now, starting to look for another manager, which I thought right.",
      "\"That's good to hear because you need to plan for everything. They've started the process of speaking to and looking at other managers, building all the sorts of data and analysing who should be the next manager of the football club. But what they've said is they're not going to be bounced into - irrespective of wins or draws or losses on the pitch in this next couple of months - making an appointment. They're going to wait until towards the end of the season.",
      "\"If Michael then at that point makes himself available for the job, and I did actually say a couple of weeks ago, I wondered whether Michael actually would say no. He is that type of guy Michael, he's someone who would always work in the best interest of the football club. He may do that, or he might say no, I feel comfortable enough and I've built such a good relationship with the players, his coaching staff to put his name in the hat.",
      "\"At that point Michael Carrick, like in any other recruitment role in the country for any other business, would go into what would be a process versus the likes of Thomas Tuchel and all the others that are going to become available in the summer. I think that's fair.\"",
      "The arrival of Carrick has certainly lifted the mood at Old Trafford after United were winless in four and with only one victory in seven matches in all competitions before their former midfielder was hired following Ruben Amorim's exit at the start of January.",
      "And Neville was full of praise for the job his former team-mate has done in turning around Man Utd's fortunes, saying the position they are in now was unthinkable a few weeks ago.",
      "\"I can't believe where Manchester United are,\" Neville said.",
      "\"I watched them six out of those seven games before Ruben Amorim was sacked, and after that against Burnley when Darren Fletcher took over, it was terrible. It was really was shocking, and what Michael Carrick has done, he's rebuilt trust instantly and faith. The players, straightaway, are listening. They're trusting in what the message is and it's a complete about turn.",
      "\"He's done more than that, though, the results are excellent, the performances are fantastic and I like what I see. He's rebuilt faith in the system of play in the 4-4-1-1, and the way in which United should always play.",
      "\"Everything at the moment for United is looking really, really good.",
      "\"They do look like they really have got an incredible chance [of qualifying for the Champions League], because of the fact they haven't got the confusion, and the chaotic fixture list that some of the others have.",
      "\"You would think that they've got a massive chance now, with the way in which Carrick has set about the job of getting into the Champions League. It was unthinkable only four or five weeks ago, unthinkable.",
      "\"If they win another four or five games then they're almost emphatically in the Champions League, and that would be incredible.",
      "\"It'd be a great position to be in by the way [for appointing a new manager], if you think about where probably Jim Ratcliffe, Omar Berrada, Jason Wilcox thought they were going to be maybe a few weeks ago.\"",

      "Man Utd have won four Premier League games on the bounce for the first time since 2024; Michael Carrick has overseen wins against Tottenham, Fulham, Arsenal and Manchester City; he believes the team are now playing with \"expression and excitement\"",
      "Sunday 8 February 2026 07:02, UK",
      "It's four Premier League wins in a row for Manchester United under Michael Carrick and a season that was unraveling just weeks ago now looks full of potential and promise.",
      "A 2-0 victory over Tottenham at Old Trafford extended Carrick's 100 per cent start as head coach and will further strengthen his case to be given the job on a long-term basis. At the very least, his impressive impact surely puts him in the conversation.",
      "Saturday's win also marks the first time in two years that United have won four Premier League games on the spin, with hopes of a top-four finish and a return to the lucrative Champions League now looking more realistic than not.",
      "Carrick was particularly pleased with the purpose of his side, encouraging \"expression and excitement\", as Bryan Mbeumo and Bruno Fernandes scored the goals that extended their unbeaten streak to eight games overall - their longest run since 2022.",
      "\"The first goal is normally vital, to get ahead, but I think it's just encouraging the expression, the attacking play,\" Carrick said.",
      "\"Not so much enjoyment where you can do what you want and it's a playground, kind of flicks and tricks, but more playing with a purpose and confidence.",
      "\"The connection with everyone has been as good as anything. The feeling, the emotion and connection with players, staff and fans - it feels good. We've had to win games in different ways. It gives me a lot of satisfaction to see the stadium this way, to look forward to the excitement.",
      "\"I'm pleased with the buy-in. We're in a good emotional place and that helps you. The four games we've had look different, we've not cracked it. I'm aware of that.",
      "\"We're just moving on to the next one and not settling for what we've got. Not taking things for granted is something we speak about a lot and the boys have been really good for that so far.\"",
      "Carrick has transformed United's fortunes since he was parachuted in to replace Ruben Amorim last month. As well as beating Spurs and Fulham, he has also masterminded wins over the division's top two sides Arsenal and Manchester City.",
      "Captain Fernandes believes Carrick has added 'something special.' He said: \"Carrick came in with the right ideas, giving the players the responsibility and freedom on the pitch.",
      "\"It's very good. I was sure he would be a great manager and he is showing it. We hope we can help him even more.",
      "\"Everyone understands the pressure of playing for this club, everyone knows the expectations around it. He knows what it means for this club to win. It adds something special to the team.\"",
      "Fernandes himself has been at the heart of United's revival. Asked if the midfielder is among the most in-form players in the Premier League currently, Carrick added: \"Listen, it'd take a long time to sum it up [his contribution here].",
      "\"I think he's offered the club so much in the time he's been here, since he walked in the door. He played different roles today for us and ended up on the left. The second goal was from the left as we changed things around a little bit.",
      "\"He's a team player, he gives so much to the group. He's got big moments in him but we know the quality he has. He cares a lot for this football club and the team and that is clear to see.\"",
      "There was plenty of hyperbolic conversation in the press room at Old Trafford on Saturday. The question most were asking: 'Are Manchester United back?'",
      "Not to rain on the parade, but it's perhaps a little too early to declare United as fully reformed. They do, however, look imposing in Carrick's mould, fluid in attack and organised defensively.",
      "He was true to form post-match, calm and controlled in his exchanges with reporters, emphasising that nothing has been achieved yet. Tangibly it hasn't. But for these long-suffering United fans, the gift of four on the bounce will feel like a lottery win. These are heady times given what came before.",
      "Carrick's United have already eclipsed last season's points total with over a third of the season remaining. It's impossible to overstate the underperformance in the 18 months preceding his appointment, but equally important to highlight the impact since. What I like most is the coordination in each attacking phase; so well balanced.",
      "Carrick is also showing impressive maturity and composure in-game. His decision-making is drawing praise. This looks to be the start of something with huge promise - and maybe even longevity.",

And the decision to leave Kobbie Mainoo out in the cold for so long by the previous regime is looking sillier by the week. Combined, the team have scored 10 goals in four under Carrick, and conceded just four. The improvement across the board is as obvious on the eye as it is measured by results.",

      "Cristian Romero as captain is a problem for Thomas Frank, despite him not wanting to admit it. Continually, Romero has proved himself to be unreliable and reckless. And now he's surely also beginning to lose some of the respect of his team-mates, sent off for the second time this season at the cost of a four-game suspension. He's the first player to be sent off twice in the Premier League this season.",
      "Some might argue he should not have even started the game at Old Trafford given his midweek rant about the Tottenham squad's \"disgraceful depth\", but Frank backed him. He badly let his manager down. Now he's lost the moral high ground too.",
      "There is something awfully ironic about a player so troubled by Tottenham's lack of options that he took to social media to spell out his gripe publicly, who himself is now unavailable to feature for his team until mid-March. Romero has one red card for every 25 games he has played for the club. Those in glass houses should not throw stones - the defender would be wise to remember that.Laura Hunter",
      "Gabriel Jesus' return from injury has meant one key thing from the perspective of Viktor Gyokeres. He is no longer guaranteed to lead the line for Arsenal.",
      "Given it has been a tough season for the Swede, it may have been easy for him to go into his shell even more. He has been used to averaging a goal a game or better in the last couple of seasons. With 11 goals in 31 appearances for the Gunners, he is well off those levels.",
      "But a noticeable improvement is apparent. The 27-year-old has eight goal involvements in his last eight games. In 2026, he has more goals than any other Premier League player across all competitions.",
      "Yes, some might point to the opposition in some of these. Kairat Almaty should've been brushed aside. Leeds and Sunderland are not easy games, but still ones you'd expect Arsenal to win. But amongst that are also goals and assists against Chelsea and Inter Milan too.",
      "Notably, the goal against Inter was similar to his second against the Black Cats. Gyokeres was able to bear down on goal with the opposition pressing. The finishes were different, but the nature was the same. And he was fresher having come off the bench.",
      "Perhaps that's the key for unlocking the best from Gyokeres towards the back end of the season. With Jesus and Havertz back as options, does Arteta look at Gyokeres as more of an impact player on the bench.",
      "That role would appear to suit his strengths some more. Very rarely do Arsenal play in a way that allows Gyokeres the chance to run in behind and get a march on defenders, since they are usually holding possession in areas high up the pitch.",
      "But, in tight games like against Inter or Sunderland, their resolute defensive structure means they can soak up pressure and then hit teams on the break. With Gyokeres fresh and up top in those moments, there's no player in that Gunners squad they'd rather have leading the charge.",
      "The strength in depth Arteta has at his disposal is going to be crucial from now until the end of the season. Nine goals from the bench is the highest of any Premier League club and proves just how much quality he has. But just as important as that. is how he utilises it.",
      "Would Gyokeres have been dreaming of coming to the Emirates to be a player to come off the bench? Of course not. However, that may be where he is most effective from now up until the season's end.Callum Bishop",
      "Defying expected goals has been a common theme for Aston Villa this season but it looks like their luck is beginning to run out.",
      "Morgan Rogers' well-taken goal was against the run of play and the promise they showed in the early stages of this game quickly faded.",
      "A tally of just 0.44 xG highlights the lack of cutting edge, intent and quality in the final third which plagued this performance.",
      "If it wasn't for Emiliano Martinez and the seven saves he made, Villa would have walked away empty-handed.",
      "A nine-point gap to Arsenal at the top of the table has quickly opened and dreams of competing for the title have shifted to fears over the likes of Chelsea and Manchester United closing in behind them.",
      "They still hold an eight-point gap on Liverpool in sixth but if they continue to play like this, that will reduce and their hopes of securing Champions League football will follow suit.",
      "In both the defeat to Brentford and the draw to Bournemouth, Villa have been dull and uninspiring. Injuries have plagued the squad, but there is no time for excuses; Villa need to find their spark again.Patrick Rowe",
      "One goal, one assist - Rayan's already lighting up the Premier League after just two appearances.",
      "The 19-year-old Brazilian is seen as Antoine Semenyo's long-term replacement after signing for Bournemouth in a £30.3m deal from Vasco da Gama during the January transfer window.",
      "The winger came on to provide an assist in the 2-0 victory at Wolves last weekend and was then handed his first start against Aston Villa, hitting the crossbar with a header in the first half before netting the equaliser in the second.",
      "Rayan's size instantly makes him stand out. He is not as lightweight as his compatriot Estevao at Chelsea and is more of a direct runner like Semenyo. That's how he scored what should be the first of many for Bournemouth, driving past Lucas Digne into the area before finishing.",
      "He will have little issue in adapting to the physicality of the Premier League, winning eight of his 13 duels against Villa and under Andoni Iraola, he can be moulded into the club's next hot property.David Richardson",
      "West Ham love a talisman. A maverick-type individual who doesn't necessarily bend or sway in the same direction of the team but will always deliver.",

      "Crysencio Summerville could be another talisman on a long line of individual stars at West Ham as he continues drive West Ham's survival bid.",
      "His fifth straight goal in as many matches at Burnley was a crucial one. For many obvious reasons, as it set the tone for the Hammers' eventual victory.",
      "However, on a personal note, it marks the \"coming of a Hammer\" for Summerville, who hadn't scored all season before his current run.",
      "While his talent has never been questioned since making the move from Leeds in 2024, his consistency due to injury has hindered his overall impact.",

      "In a season marred by injury and frustration, doubts about Cole Palmer were just starting to creep into mainstream football conversation.",
      "Before Saturday's win at Wolves, Palmer had just four goals this season, with only two Premier League goals from open play since January 2025, and looked a player bereft of confidence in a disappointing substitute appearance against Arsenal in the Carabao Cup in midweek.",
      "How about a hat-trick to silence the doubters?",
      "With this triple, Palmer became the first player in Premier League history to score three hat-tricks in the first half of a match, while his four hat-tricks overall are the most of any Chelsea player in Premier League history.",
      "But it was the manner of his three goals which will mean so much to the Chelsea star. He took his two penalties with his quintessential coolness - and smashing in his hat-trick goal from open play three minutes after his second displayed the confident Palmer Chelsea fans had grown so used to seeing in the last two seasons.",
      "\"In terms of Cole, we know what a world-class player he is,\" said new Chelsea boss Liam Rosenior, who lauded his hat-trick hero throughout his post-match press conference.",
      "\"He's played a lot of football for the last year, not much rest, but when he's at his best, he's unstoppable.\"",
      "With eight wins in their last 10 games, Chelsea are a team on the up - and a fully-fit, confident Palmer will only increase opponents' fears of an already formidable side.Noah Langford",
      "Rob Edwards had seen his side go a whole month without scoring a Premier League goal so perhaps the Wolves boss could be forgiven going with such an attacking line-up for the visit of Chelsea. It was a 4-2-3-1 with Angel Gomes as a deep-lying playmaker.",
      "\"We wanted to be really positive, we wanted to be brave, press higher, and then we wanted to try and have more of an attacking threat on the pitch. Removing a defender and putting a more attacking player on it, simply speaking that was the thinking.\"",
      "He abandoned the plan when 3-0 down inside the first half. The penalties conceded by Matt Doherty and Yerson Mosquera were labelled \"ludicrous mistakes\" by Edwards. His side threatened to capitulate in the minutes that followed before going to a back five.",
      "The issues were as much mental as tactical but it was a chastening reminder for Edwards of the fragility - just one of the reasons why Wolves are rooted to the bottom of the table. Dealing with these battle scars is just part of the challenge he faces now.Adam Bate",
      "The boos that rang around St James' Park were angry and pointed. Newcastle fans expect better than this.",
      "Eddie Howe was keen to accept that - but also provide mitigating circumstances. Five injured players are out in Joelinton, Fabian Schar, Tino Livarmento, Lewis Miley and Anthony Gordon. There is also a hectic fixture list which is not holding up, while simple mistakes are being punished.",
      "The excuses have been there all season for Newcastle. A lack of attacking fluency could go date back to Alexander Isak's transfer saga - that set the club back in their pre-season preparations. Newcastle now don't know who their No 9 is out of Nick Woltemade and Yoane Wissa, perhaps Isak's transfer drama is finally catching up with them.",
      "But there are also circumstances that Howe can control. Newcastle have conceded 15 goals in their last five games - even though defence is an area the club actually strengthened in last summer.",
      "Everything that made Howe's Newcastle hard to beat is drifting away. And that tough fixture list, it's hotting up. Up next are four testing away games in Spurs, Aston Villa, Qarabag and Man City. If Howe can't find a solution to this slump, this could get ugly.Sam Blitz",
      "Everton manager David Moyes was not sure whether to talk up his side's European prospects or play them down after their late come-from-behind win at Fulham, and instead ended up doing both!",
      "\"Hugely important [win] and I think it probably keeps us away from the big R word at the bottom of the league, that's for sure,\" he initially said after the game without a hint of sarcasm, before revealing his true feelings.",
      "\"I don't want to come in here and say we're trying to avoid relegation. I don't want to do that because Everton have had too much bad news and bad publicity, so I'd rather come in here and say we're having a go at Europe.",
      "\"You might laugh at me in a few weeks' time and say, 'How stupid was I', but I'd rather be positive.\"",
      "However, with the Toffees now in a tightly congested pack hot on the tails of sixth-placed Liverpool, Moyes and his players really can dare to dream of a first European appearance for nine seasons and why not, given their impressive form since the Scot returned to manage the club last January.",
      "In fact, Everton rank sixth for points won in that time, so do not be shocked if that is where they finish come May.Richard Morgan",
      "Elland Road. Under the lights. It's a formidable challenge for any Premier League side and the home advantage Leeds garner in these matches was plain to see on a wet, windy and wildly successful night for Daniel Farke's side. They've won all five of their evening kick-offs here this season now.",
      "The playing surface wasn't ideal for either side - Farke suggested it was more suitable for sheep than footballers - but Leeds' high-intensity play, fuelled by the energy of their supporters, left Forest stuck in the mud.",
      "Across the pitch, Leeds players were excellent, from Karl Darlow's saves and James Justin's chance creation to Iliev Gruev's box-to-box excellence and the goal-scoring of Jayden Bogle, Noah Okafor and Dominic Calvert-Lewin.",
      "Their nine-point advantage on the drop zone was trimmed to six by Saturday's win for West Ham but that made this impressive thumping of Forest all the more important. A tricky run of fixtures is coming up but with points on the board and taking the confidence from this display, Farke's side should be optimistic of winning this Premier League survival battle.Peter Smith",

      "Match report as Michael Carrick extended his perfect record as Manchester United boss with his fourth win since taking over from Ruben Amorim; United scored once in each half after Cristian Romero was sent off for a dangerous tackle on Casemiro; Carrick's side stay fourth; Spurs are 14th",
      "Saturday 7 February 2026 19:44, UK",
      "Michael Carrick made it four wins from four as Manchester United landed a confident 2-0 victory over toothless Tottenham, with the visitors' misery compounded by Cristian Romero's second sending off of the season.",
      "The Spurs captain had been defended by Thomas Frank in the week after an outburst on social media criticised the club's \"disgraceful\" lack of depth - Frank labelled the comments \"passionate\" and opted to field him as part of a revamped back four anyway, only for him to see red for a rash challenge on Casemiro in the 29th minute.",
      "Romero has now been sent off six times across all competitions since his Spurs debut in August 2021 - more than any other player in the competition in that period and faces a four-game suspension as a consequence.",
      "The home side's opener arrived nine minutes later via a well-worked set-piece. Bruno Fernandes and Kobbie Mainoo were both involved, allowing Bryan Mbeumo to tuck home his eighth goal of a fruitful campaign. United's coordination in attack was impressive despite the scarcity of more goals, needing a flurry of late chances to finally yield a game-sealing second thanks to Fernandes in the 81st minute.",
      "The same cannot be said of Spurs. Under Frank, Tottenham are winless when trailing at the break and so it proved again, with Romero's dismissal raising more questions over the management of a squad decimated by injuries, but surely better than the 14th place they find themselves in. Even with a full complement of players in the first half they looked blunt.",
      "Carrick's audition for the permanent role at Old Trafford continues to go from strength to strength, cementing their position inside the top four, while Frank's credit is surely waning. Spurs have slumped to their 10th defeat and are only nine points above the Premier League drop zone.",
      "Man Utd: Lammens (7), Dalot (7), Maguire (7), Martinez (7), Shaw (6), Casemiro (7), Mainoo (6), Amad (5), Fernandes (7), Cunha (6), Mbeumo (7).\n\n\nSubs: Sesko (6), Mazraoui (n/a), Ugarte (n/a), Zirkzee (n/a), Fletcher (n/a).\n\n\nTottenham: Vicario (5), Udogie (6), Van de Ven (5), Romero (1), Gray (5), Sarr (6), Palhinha (5), Gallagher (6), Simons (6), Solanke (6), Odobert (4).\n\n\nSubs: Dragusin (6), Souza (5), Kolo Muani (n/a), Bissouma (n/a), Tel (n/a).\n\n\nPlayer of the Match: Bruno Fernandes",
      "\"It's incredible. We have had moments where we were not great but the crowd was still like this. The energy is different because we win, everything looks brighter.\"",
      "On Carrick's impact: \"Carrick came in with the right ideas, giving the players the responsibility and freedom on the pitch.",
      "\"It's very good. I was sure he would be a great manager and he is showing it. We hope we can help him even more.",
      "\"Everyone understands the pressure of playing for this club, everyone knows the expectations around it. He knows what it means for this club to win. It adds something special to the team.\"",
      "Tottenham boss Thomas Frank:",
      "\"We started well, good away performance. Very even. Happy with that. The red card changed the momentum. Proud of the players for the 60 minutes, how they showed resilience and stayed in the game, kept fighting. We still created moments.",
      "\"It's very tough to go out and not get enough results, we haven't won enough. There is still a lot to hang a hat on. But form has to back that up, and we have to keep doing the right things. There is no other alternative than to keep going, which we will do.",
      "\"In the very tough times it's head down, stand up, work hard. There is no other way.\"",
      "On Romero's red: \"The red card is a red card. I've watched it back five times. Cuti tried to go for the ball. You play with passion and aggression and there's a fine line.\"",
      "Asked if he regrets making him captain: \"No. He's apologised to his team-mates in the changing room. He's one of our most important players. He doesn't have any intention to get a red card.",
      "\"He's apologised to the team and that's enough for me right now, there's nothing more to do.\"",
      "Man Utd boss Michael Carrick:",
      "\"I'm encouraging confidence, not flicks and tricks, but playing with purpose.",
      "\"The connection with everyone has been as good as anything. The feeling, the emotion and connection with players, staff and fans - it feels good. We've had to win games in different ways. It gives me a lot of satisfaction to see the stadium this way, to look forward to the excitement.",
      "\"I'm pleased with the buy-in. We're in a good emotional place and that helps you. The four games we've had look different, we've not cracked it. I'm aware of that.\"",

      "Saturday 7 February 2026 17:51, UK",
      "Michael Carrick says Manchester United cannot make a \"knee-jerk\" decision about their long-term future on the back of him winning his first three matches as head coach.",
      "The Red Devils turned to their former midfielder, captain and coach on a deal until the end of the campaign after Ruben Amorim's patchy 14-month reign came to an acrimonious end in early January.",
      "Carrick has rejuvenated United since taking over as head coach three weeks ago, with wins against Manchester City, Arsenal and Fulham propelling the side up to fourth in the Premier League.",
      "Next up is an Old Trafford clash with his former club Tottenham on Saturday. The 44-year-old says he would not get carried away if they won again - and nor does he believe the club would.",
      "\"Nothing's changed, no, to be honest,\" said Carrick - nominated for January's Premier League Manager of the Month award.",
      "\"It's not going to change what I do, or how I feel about it. I think I'm fully aware of the role I'm doing here and the responsibility I've got.",
      "\"We want to be successful. I want the club to be successful beyond the end of the season. If that's me, if that's somebody else at this stage, I can't control that and we'll see what happens.",
      "\"But it's certainly about trying to improve the team and keep making Manchester United stronger and improving all the time. But nothing's changed. The results over a short period of time don't change that.",
      "\"If they have changed that, there's something wrong. It can't be so knee-jerk either way, whether it's really good or whether there are a few issues we need to solve. It's steady progress, really.",
      "\"You know that football can twist and turn just as quick, so we have got to keep it a bit level, really, and keep focusing on what we need to do.\"",
      "Carrick was chosen to take charge for the remainder of the season after United also spoke to former boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer.",
      "The Red Devils decided to bring in a coach with an understanding of the club to smooth the transition into a short-term role, allowing director of football Jason Wilcox time to undergo a thorough recruitment process.",

      "\"I feel at home here but I fully understand the situation, so I'm not getting too carried away.\"",
      "Carrick's only focus right now is United's upcoming matches, with Saturday's match against Tottenham followed by facing another of his former clubs on Tuesday - West Ham, away.",
      "\"What he needs - and it probably wouldn't help him - is to win five or six on the trot, then lose three or four on the trot, and then how do you respond?",
      "\"People will say he should never be Man Utd coach. But when you lose those three or four games and the scrutiny comes on you at the biggest club in the world, how are you going to cope?",
      "\"We saw it with Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, he came in, was at the wheel - but then you see pictures of him at Watford away when they got destroyed and he looked lost.",
      "\"Carrick probably needs to lose three or four on the trot, then win five on the trot and everybody will go: that's a good manager. He's turned it around when the pressure was on. That's the only way you're ever going to know how good he is.\"",
