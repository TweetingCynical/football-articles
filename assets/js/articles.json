      "Manchester United have spent big so far this summer as they look to bounce back from last season's disappointing campaign, which saw the Red Devils finish 15th in the Premier League and fail to qualify for the Champions League after losing the Europa League final.",
      "United have spent more than £200million to bring in Benjamin Sesko, Bryan Mbeumo, Matheus Cunha and Diego Leon, while Marcus Rashford has joined Barcelona on loan with an option to buy and Christian Eriksen and Victor Lindelof have been released.",
      "More incomings and outgoings are expected before the transfer window slams shut, with manager Ruben Amorim keen to strengthen his squad in several positions while also offloading a number of fringe players.",
      "Bruno Fernandes turned down the chance to join Al-Hilal earlier this summer, but fellow Saudi Pro League side Al-Ittihad are now hoping to sign the midfielder.",
      "According to a report from the Sun, a 'positive' meeting has already taken place between the two camps and Fernandes is said to be demanding a contract worth £33m-a-year. Speaking earlier this summer, Fernandes admitted he would be willing to leave if United wanted to sell.",
      "\"I have always been honest,\" he said. \"I've always said I will be here until the club says to me that it's time to go. I'm eager to do more, to be able to bring the club the great days. In the day that the club thinks that I'm too much or it's time to part ways, football is like this, you never know it.",
      "\"But I've always said it and I keep my word in the same way. If the club thinks it's time to part ways because they want to do some cashing in or whatever, it's what it is, and football sometimes is like this.\"",
      "Sancho is part of Ruben Amorim's 'bomb squad' after spending last season out on loan at Chelsea, while Hojlund's future was plunged into doubt after Manchester United signed Benjamin Sesko from RB Leipzig.",
      "Senne Lammens appears to be edging closer to joining Manchester United after he was left out of the squad by Royal Antwerp for their 2-1 win over Mechelen on Sunday.",
      "Ruben Amorim is keen to bring in Lammens to provide more competition for Andre Onana, who has come in for criticism since signing for United after making a series of errors. And the deal looks to be close after Antwerp did not pick him against Mechelen, with Yannick Thoelen handed his first start of the season and new signing Taishi Brandon Nozawa on the bench.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Ruben Amorim's decision to start Benjamin Sesko on the bench for Manchester United's trip to Fulham has been slammed by Andy Gray, who says he is \"flabbergasted\" that the striker isn't starting games.",
      "United headed into the summer transfer window desperate for a new No 9 after both Rasmus Hojlund and Joshua Zirkzee struggled for goals last season and paid big money to bring Sesko to Old Trafford. The Slovenia international, 22, has been eased into life in the Premier League, though, and came off the bench against Arsenal last week and in United's 1-1 draw with Fulham on Sunday.",
      "Mason Mount started the game in attack alongside Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo. But while Cunha and Mbeumo have been thrust straight into the team after big money moves of their own, Amorim is taking a different approach with Sesko - and Gray simply doesn't get why.",
      "\"I don’t get it. I am flabbergasted,\" he told beIN SPORTS. \"I moved to clubs for big money during my career and trust me, I didn’t need three or four weeks to understand the team.",
      "\"Sesko is an international footballer, played in the Bundesliga, he cost more than £70m… are you telling me he can’t go into that Manchester United team as a centre forward and play there? Come on! I must have missed something, seriously.",
      "\"If you’re a United fan, you want Sesko up there with Mbeumo and Cunha. He’s had a pre-season in Germany, he’s fit and ready to go. I’m staggered, I don’t get it.\"",
      "Owen Hargreaves, meanwhile, fears that signing Sesko hasn't necessarily solved United's issues up front. The former Manchester United midfielder also thinks the goalkeeper position could become an issue after Altay Bayindir started the Fulham game ahead of Andre Onana, who was left out of the squad that lost to Arsenal last weekend.",
      "\"I love Mbeumo, I love Cunha, Bruno had a bad game today, but my biggest worry is the goalkeeper situation isn’t addressed and the striker situation isn’t addressed,\" Hargreaves told Premier League Productions.",
      "\"I have never seen a team win without top players in those two positions. Maybe they are going to address that in the next week. But goalkeeper, striker, he has to address.",
      "\"The two in behind in Mbeumo and Cunha are fantastic but the one at the top and at the back, they need to address as soon as possible. You look at the fixtures, Burnley at home you expect to win but [Manchester] City and Chelsea are really difficult.\"",

      "The Red Devils captain, 30, missed a penalty in Sunday's trip to the capital after skying a spot-kick in the first half. An own goal from Rodrigo Muniz eventually broke the deadlock on the hour mark but United were denied all three points by Emile Smith Rowe, who struck in the 73rd minute.",
      "Fernandes has been United's most influential and consistent player during a turbulent period for the club, who endured their worst ever Premier League campaign last term, finishing down in 15th place.",
      "The Portugal international played as part of a midfield pairing at Craven Cottage rather than a more advanced role and Amorim appeared to admit post-match that his captain was frustrated with his overall involvement.",
      "On the result, Amorim added: \"We can do better but we are putting the effort so that is the most important to me. In some moments we did well, especially in the beginning of the game. After the goal we were just thinking about the result. We were ok until the goal and then we were not smart in that moment.\"",
      "\"We have to think about the performance. I know what the feeling is of a player who has to win every match. We missed a penalty, we missed some chances and then we score and we had to defend that goal. We have to focus on our movements and play until the end.\"",
      "Fernandes was visibly irked when Chris Kavanagh accidentally bumped into him just before he prepared to take his penalty in the first half. The Manchester United captain refused to blame the incident with Kavanagh for his missed spot-kick but was not happy with the referee's failure to apologise.",
      "\"It upset me because the referee didn’t apologise, and that was what triggered me in the moment. But that’s not the excuse to missing the penalty. I just had a very bad hit on the ball. I took my foot too under the ball and that’s why the ball ended up going over the bar.\"",

      "But all they had to show for it was a deflected header from teenage centre-back Leny Yoro, which went in off the back of Rodrigo Muniz, in a frustrating 1-1 draw.",
      "Cunha hit a post inside two minutes but Mbeumo was anonymous and Sesko, the £73m signing from RB Leipzig who came on as a substitute, did not muster a single effort at goal.",
      "Bruno Fernandes also missed a first-half penalty, and it came as no surprise when Fulham secured a deserved point through Emile Smith Rowe with 18 minutes left.",
      "“It was a tough match, and when we scored the goal we forgot about maintaining the way we play and tried to maintain the result. We want to win so bad,” said United boss Amorim.",
      "“After the goals we were just thinking about maintaining the advantage and we cannot do that. We have to grow up a lot as a team. The feeling is there. We are going to score goals because we are creating chances and that is the most important thing.",
      "“He (Sesko) needs time. It’s not easy to come off the bench when the game is really fast. He is learning the game is faster than the Bundesliga but he had some good connections with his team-mates.”",
      "The match burst into life after half an hour when the VAR spotted some grappling in the area between Calvin Bassey and Mason Mount at a corner. Replays showed the Fulham defender had virtually thrown Mount over his shoulder to the ground, WWE style.",

United did go ahead in the 58th minute through the unlikely source of teenage defender Yoro, who met Mbeumo’s corner with a header which hit the back of Muniz and wrongfooted Bernd Leno as it flew into the net.",

The 20-year-old watched from the bench as Fernandes blasted a first-half penalty over the crossbar, before Fulham substitute Emile Smith-Rowe equalised after Rodrigo Muniz's unfortunate own goal gave United the lead.",
      "Mainoo was also an unused substitute in the Red Devils' 1-0 home defeat to Arsenal, where Amorim's attackers were similarly gun-shy. However, Amorim, who is reluctant to budge from his favourite 3-4-3 formation, insists the United academy graduate is competing with Fernandes for a place in the starting XI.",
      "Amorim said: \"Mainoo is fighting for his position with Bruno. I changed two midfielders, I left Mason Mount there because we wanted to score a goal and when I changed, I felt the team needed one holding midfielder.",
      "“So he needs to fight for his position with Bruno. At the moment he is fighting in training with Bruno for the position.\" Amorim deployed Fernandes and Casemiro as his two holding midfielders, before replacing the latter with Manuel Ugarte.",

      "Aside from a bright opening half an hour where Cunha hit the post and saw a one-on-one be saved well by Fulham keeper Bernd Leno, United struggled to create chances.",

      "Kavanagh gave the spotkick despite Luke Shaw also appearing to pull down Muniz a split-second after Bassey's challenge on Mount. Silva sarcastically said: “Millions and millions saw what happened here this afternoon in terms of the VAR decisions.",

The Premier League is the best in the world and always believe England has a chance. Author of Arsene Wenger: The Inside Story of Arsenal Under Wenger.",
      "Despite spending £206m on new forwards this summer, Manchester United are still reduced to sending on Harry Maguire for set-pieces. This time, even super-sub Maguire could not provide any late salvation as United’s luck finally ran out at Craven Cottage.",
      "But what a sorry state of affairs for Ruben Amorim that between them, Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko, have not yet been able to find the net.",
      "And instead, for the second week running, United were undone by their own frailties at the back as Fulham substitute Emile Smith Rowe scored with his first touch just 96 seconds after coming on.",
      "That ended United’s remarkable eight-game winning streak at Craven Cottage and Amorim’s new-look line-up has only gained one point from their opening two games.",
      "Not much of a return on their superstar front three even if Sesko had to be content again with a substitute appearance. Cunha had lovely moments in the first half, Mbeumo provided the corner for Leny Yoro’s deflected header to put United in front and yet you just cannot win games if you make big mistakes.",
      "Bruno Fernandes slashed a penalty way over the bar and blamed referee Chris Kavanagh for getting in his way in the process. That seems rather typical of Fernandes to blame someone else and you do have to question United’s defending on the equaliser.",
      "United defender Matthijs De Ligt hesitated, seemed to leave the ball and it allowed Smith Rowe to sneak in and score. Amorim’s men lost to Arsenal last week, blew a lead this time and only really have a week to solve their problems which are pretty obvious.",
      "Maguire is such a willing player, a real loyal club servant and yet it cannot be on him each week to come on and try to salvage results from last-gasp set-pieces. The forward line is showing real promise but United are undermined by no-one grasping the No1 jersey as first-choice keeper and midfield remains an issue.",
      "Fulham gave everything, battled and scraped their way back from going behind and part of that is United still not having a midfield general to boss the game and shut it all down. The United keeper situation is a soap opera in itself. Altay Bayindir kept his place despite his howler against Arsenal last week, Andre Onana was on the bench with Tom Heaton in the squad but not among the substitutes.",
      "They are keen on Royal Antwerp keeper Senne Lammens but that seems another quick fix when a proper one is needed. At least Bayindir did better this week. Cunha hit the post early on and Bayindir made a good save. The United keeper’s long punt then put Cunha away and he nearly scored only to be denied by Fulham’s Bernd Leno.",
      "The real talking point of the first half came after 35 minutes. Referee Kavanagh gave a penalty after he checked the VAR screen and ruled Fulham defender Calvin Bassey had wrestled Mason Mount to the ground in a goalmouth scramble.",
      "Fernandes is normally so reliable from the spot - only missing six from 65 in his career - and yet blasted miles over the bar. It has to be a first, blaming the ref for missing a penalty.",
      "United went ahead after 58 minutes. Mbeumo’s corner was headed towards goal by Yoro, it hit Fulham striker Rodrigo Muniz on the back and somehow went in. That was surely lift off.",
      "But Fulham battled back and deserved their point. Smith Rowe has been underwhelming since his £34m move. And his goal was created by Arsenal’s academy.",
      "Alex Iwobi sent in a near post cross, in nipped Smith Rowe as United’s defence hesitated and he scored to add to Amorim’s frustrations. But it was no more than Fulham deserved.",

      "Bruno Fernandes was made to rue a hapless first half penalty that almost landed in the Thames as Manchester United failed to win for the second week of the new season in a row.",
      "The United skipper blazed an effort way over the top after Calvin Bassey had been penalised for hauling down Mason Mount in the box towards the end of a first half in which Matheus Cunha twice came close to scoring for the visitors.",
      "United did take the lead in the second period when Leny Yoro's header struck Rodrigo Muniz before dropping into the Fulham forward's own goal, but home substitute Emile Smith Rowe equalised with his first touch of the game to secure Fulham a deserved point from their second 1-1 draw of the season.",
      "Here are the game's main talking points.",
      "You'd expect United to get better under Amorim this season because they only have to clear a relatively low bar, but while that work progresses the club's fans can at least have fun watching Cunha.",
      "The Brazilian twice almost gave his side the lead in the opening exchanges only to be denied by a post and a brilliant Bernd Leno save, and while question marks remain over his temperament, he is quickly becoming the most exciting thing to watch about his new team.",
      "Nineteen of the 20-man Fulham matchday squad were at the club last season, with 34-year-old substitute goalkeeper Benjamin Lecomte, a free transfer from Montpellier, the only new face.",
      "The freshest face belonged to 18-year-old Josh King though, and he was a lively presence in a home side who obviously need more attacking punch. Fulham need new faces in the next week, but at least in King - and the impact of Smith Rowe - there is hope.",
      "Rowers had an unidentified flying object to contend with in the 38th minute when Fernandes skied his penalty a long way over the bar. It was very unlike the Portuguese, and his performances of late - and indeed under Ruben Amorim - really don't deserve criticism. He remains Manchester United's shining light.",
      "The feud he started with Chris Kavanagh, who accidentally bumped into him before the spot kick, really wasn't to edifying though, and served as a reminder of his bad old days of constant moaning. If anything he let the incident get the better of him.",
      "The moment which led to that penalty was, we were told, an example of the type of thing that will be cracked down upon this season as Bassey was penalised for hauling down Mount.",
      "It was a penalty, albeit one that needed a long VAR review, but by looking into these sort of incidents with more scrutiny referees may just be making rods for their own backs. All penalty area incidents will now need extra scrutiny, and indeed Fulham can feel hard done by that Yoro wasn't punished for a push on Bassey before the United goal.",
      "With Senne Lammens having been pulled out of Royal Antwerp's match on Sunday it would be tempting to say that the most significant Manchester United goalkeeper news of the day happened away from west London, but that is reckoning without the look on Andre Onana's face.",
      "The Cameroonian looked less than impressed to be named on the bench at Craven Cottage, with Altay Bayindir starting again, and while Lammens would appear to be coming in as a second-choice stopper it is obvious that all is not well within the gloved ranks.",
      "Onana will be aware that United are scouring the market for goalkeepers, and while he is likely to eventually get his No.1 place back, he's going to be under mounting pressure when he does so.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Fernandes stepped up to take the spot kick, but as he was gradually walking backwards to prepare for his run-up, Kavanagh accidentally bumped into him as he tried to get out of the way.",
      "A replay of the clip shows Kavanagh appear to apologise, but Fernandes clearly looks furious and gesticulates with his hands to complain for interrupting him.",
      "Fernandes then skiied his effort over the bar, an unusual moment for the Portuguese playmaker, who has become renowned for his nearly-immaculate penalty taking.",
      "And Neville claimed Fernandes was thrown off by the mix-up with Kavanagh, saying the playmaker felt the actions from the referee were \"clumsy\".",
      "\"I thought it was because the referee was adjusting the players on the edge of the box, but he's still having a go, Bruno Fernandes, at the referee, because he feels that was a little bit clumsy.\"",
      "Ex-United star Ashley Young backed up Neville's claims in the studio as the former defender said: \"I think the referee [Chris Kavanagh] has put him [Fernandes] off.\"",
      "Fans had their say on the incident on social media afterwards, with some saying the moment shouldn't have been significant enough to distract a professional football like Fernandes.",
      "One said: \"If Bruno Fernandes had concentrated on taking the penalty rather than whining because the referee brushed against him? He might have scored.\"",
      "Another added: \"If Bruno Fernandes is capable of being put off by something as minor as a referee accidentally bumping into him, he needs to sort himself out. Far too tempestuous when even the slightest and inconsequential thing doesn’t go his way.\"",

      "A post on the Premier League Match Centre X account confirmed Kavanagh's verdict, saying: \"After a VAR review, the referee overturned the original call of no penalty for a challenge by Bassey on Mount. Referee announcement: 'After review, Fulham number 3 pulls the Manchester (United) player to the ground. The final decision is penalty kick'.\"",

      "Gary Neville has questioned Manchester United’s goalkeeping situation, suggesting that Andre Onana’s confidence could be shaken to the extent that he might ask to be sold before next week’s transfer deadline.",
      "United chiefs are close to completing a £17m move for Royal Antwerp’s Senne Lammens, with Onana again a substitute for Sunday’s game against Fulham as Altay Bayindir remains between the posts despite an unconvincing display in the opening weekend defeat to Arsenal.",
      "Earlier in the window the Old Trafford club were linked with Aston Villa's Emi Martinez and PSG's Gianluigi Donnarumma, who now looks set to join Manchester City - but neither amounted to much more than speculation.",
      "Commenting ahead of United’s clash with the Cottagers, Neville revealed he had spoken to people inside the club who admitted a new goalkeeper remains a priority and is now left wondering if Onana might be exploring a move away.",
      "“I’ve been asking around about that one this morning and spoke to a few people at United,” Neville said. “The feeling is the new boy coming in would probably be a No2 who would start on the bench, but they absolutely do need a No1.",
      "“The main priority for United is still goals and we think (Matheus) Cunha, (Bryan) Mbeumo and (Benjamin) Sesko are going to do that. We think Onana will start today but that situation isn’t right.",
      "“Bayindir came in last week but he makes a lot of mistakes. Now that Onana knows United have been scouting around Europe for a new goalkeeper and replacement for him, his confidence must be shot at and he must be thinking he wants to get out.”",
      "The former United full back also warned that the club need to act swiftly before the transfer deadline on September 1.",
      "“They have to deal with that. That and the central midfielder slot next to Bruno [Fernandes] are the two things they need to get sorted this week.”",
      "Despite his concerns, Neville still believes Onana is the best option available to Ruben Amorim right now.",
      "Asked who he would pick against Fulham, before it was confirmed that Bayindir would remain, Neville said: “I would go with Onana, he’s the most reliable out of the unreliable goalkeepers they have.",
      "“I think Bayindir is young, Onana for me is the better goalkeeper, although he makes mistakes as well and he’s not ideal. But I think he’s got a bigger personality and character than Bayindir and he’s got that experience, so I think Onana should start.”",

      "United are currently in advanced talks with Royal Antwerp over a €20million (£17m) deal for the Belgian outfit's promising young goalkeeper, Senne Lammens. The 23-year-old is expected to complete a move to Old Trafford imminently which will only fuel talk that Onana's days as No 1 are numbered, though he is not currently expected to be sold by the club.",

      "Lammens was omitted from the Antwerp side that beat Mechelen 2-1 on Saturday as talks over a transfer advance. Reports claim that he will not necessarily become an automatic starter, though, meaning all three players could be given a chance to stake a claim to consolidate themselves as Amorim's first-choice keeper in the coming weeks.",
      "Onana was joined on the bench by United's new striker, Benjamin Sesko, for Sunday's trip to the capital. There was no place in the squad for Rasmus Hojlund, who is understood to be surplus to requirements following Sesko's arrival from RB Leipzig.",

      "Manchester United transfer target Senne Lammens has been left out of the squad for Royal Antwerp's clash with Mechelen as he inches closer to joining the Red Devils. Ruben Amorim is keen to sign a new goalkeeper, with Lammens set to provide competition for Andre Onana.",
      "Onana has come under fire since joining United from Inter Milan in 2023 after making several high-profile errors, but there is a lack of genuine competition for his spot as No.1. Onana did not make the squad for United's 1-0 defeat to Arsenal last weekend and backup goalkeeper Altay Bayindir was at fault for Riccardo Calafiori's winner.",
      "As a result, United are looking to sign Lammens for £17.3million and a deal appears to be very close after Antwerp did not select him against Mechelen. Yannick Thoelen was handed his first start of the season instead, while new signing Taishi Brandon Nozawa made the bench.",
      "Although Lammens expected arrival will leave Amorim with four options between the sticks, he has insisted that a new signing does not mean either Onana or Bayindir will leave. \"It's not an idea that 'these players are going to leave and then we'll receive another player',\" he said.",
      "\"We don't know what is going to happen but we are not waiting to take out someone to bring another player [in]. One thing is not responsible for the other.",
      "\"The players you're talking about are not players who are training with the group in this moment. We have a group training so it's not going to affect a lot.\"",

      "When asked if his squad are tougher, Amorim replied: \"Yeah, I think you can see that is a fact. Because you can see with the data. Then, with confidence sometimes you react a little bit sooner and you are near the ball.",
      "\"Again, against Arsenal we were sometimes building up but we had to kick the ball, and you could see the reaction of the players in the second balls — the duels — we are stronger, we are recovering our positions faster.",

      "Manchester United wonderkid JJ Gabriel only need 45 minutes to score for their U18s as he continued to underline his credentials after being invited to train with the first-team by Ruben Amorim.",
      "Gabriel is just 14, but has been fast-tracked in the United academy after some stellar performances and continues to perform well above his age group. And now Amorim has made him aware that he will be given the opportunity to train with the first team on occasions this season.",
      "Amorim was told about the teenager's progress earlier in the summer and was shown video clips of Gabriel during United’s pre-season tour of the United States. He has since taken a keen interest in his development and has sat down to meet Gabriel, claims the BBC.",
      "The pair met at Carrington and the youngster watched the opening Premier League match of the season against Arsenal from the directors’ box at Old Trafford.",
      "Gabriel looks to be paying back the faith shown in him and was on target twice as United's U18s hammered Middlesbrough 5-0. The 14-year-old scoring shortly before half-time and then again 20 minutes from the end during the rout.",
      "The winger committed his future to the Manchester outfit earlier in the summer, with the club’s technical director Jason Wilcox playing a role in those discussions. That is unusual for an academy player so young and highlights just how highly he is thought of at the club.",
      "Gabriel put himself on notice after scoring twice for the U18s in a 13-1 hammering of Leeds in April. That saw him become the youngest ever player to feature for United’s U18s and the team’s manager, Darren Fletcher, is the man aiding his development.",
      "The 14-year-old's incredible rise is summed up by the fact he won’t be able to play in their FA Youth Cup campaign because he is still too young. Amorim made it clear that, this summer, he wanted to combine smart recruitment with utilising the academy to produce a squad that had quality and depth.",
      "He said: \"Then we have a plan that is to bring [in] some new players. Our big plan is to improve the team we have and improve the academy as that is our future, as it was in past. It's not going to change so much.\"",

      "The Eberechi Eze transfer saga is one that can finally be ticked off after his Arsenal move was confirmed. The winger was shown off to the Emirates with north London rivals Tottenham left to lick their wounds after missing out.",
      "One storyline that still has plenty of time to play out is the Alexander Isak - Newcastle affair. Liverpool wait in the wings and the Swede is not expected to feature when the Magpies play the Reds on Monday night. It is sure to be a hostile atmosphere given the current situation.",
      "Isak maintains his time at St James' Park is up but Newcastle don't want to sell. All the while Liverpool know that they still need to add at least one more face in attack.",

      "Tottenham could be about to hijack Crystal Palace's swoop for Bilal El Khannouss.",

      "Man United captain Bruno Fernandes is a target for Al-Ittihad, according to The Sun.",
      "Fernandes was subject to interest from interest from Al Hilal earlier in the window, but wanted to remain playing in Europe, which suggests he has no interest.",

      "Altay Bayindir has been given the nod to start again for Manchester United with Andre Onana being named on the bench for their trip to Fulham.",
      "Onana, 29, suffered a hamstring injury in pre-season and was not named in the squad that lost 1-0 to Arsenal last weekend despite a significantly improved performance. Bayindir was at fault for the Gunners' goal, though Ruben Amorim defended the Turkish keeper after the game.",
      "United are currently in advanced talks with Royal Antwerp over a €20million (£17m) deal for the Belgian outfit's promising young goalkeeper, Senne Lammens. The 23-year-old is expected to complete a move to Old Trafford imminently which will only fuel suggestions that Onana's days as No 1 are numbered, though he is not currently expected to be sold.",
      "Nottingham Forest boss Nuno Espirito Santo has hit back at \"nonsense\" claims he is trying to seal an exit from the club after publicly revealing his relationship with owner Evangelos Marinakis is \"not good\".",
      "Nuno made the surprising claims ahead of his side's clash against Crystal Palace this weekend as he said \"our relations have changed\" and admitted \"where there's smoke, there's fire\" amid doubts over his job.",
      "\"Doesn't make any kind of sense. We are focused on the game and that is more important. Make sure that the players are ready. This game is going to be very tough.\"",

      "The Manchester City playmaker has now completed a season-long loan move to the Toffees and made his debut off the bench in Monday night's defeat at Leeds. Pickford and Grealish have been together in numerous England camps with their partners also good friends.",
      "Together they've helped the Three Lions reach major tournament finals and Pickford was desperate to reunite on the club scene. Grealish's time in Manchester appeared to be up and Everton moved to land him for the next 12 months.",
      "Their goalkeeper did his bit to try and get the deal over the line as he talked up the perks of being a player on Merseyside. Now that the ex-Aston Villa man is on board Pickford is talking up the potential of a European charge.",
      "He said: \"I’m good friends with Jack. When the Everton rumours started, we had a couple of conversations. I said he’d love it here, it’s a proper home club, and messaged 'Hurry up you!' When he told me it was nearly all done, I was like 'Box ticked'.\"",
      "Chelsea’s summer clear-out continues at pace with Carney Chukwuemeka and Aaron Anselmino the latest to pack their bags for Borussia Dortmund, taking the Blues’ income from sales past a jaw-dropping £270 million.",
      "Chukwuemeka, 21, who lit up Dortmund on loan last season, is going back to the Bundesliga outfit permanently in a £24 million deal with a tasty sell-on clause and the England Under-20 ace snubbed RB Leipzig to return to the Westfalenstadion.",
      "That deal alone rockets Chelsea ’s sales to a League-leading £273.4 million that almost cancels out the £277 million splashed on signings. The exodus comes after Uefa slapped the club with a £26.7 million fine for breaching their squad cost ratio rules and warned owners Clearlake Capital that they must post a positive balance if they want to register their shiny new recruits for the Champions League.",
      "Meanwhile, Argentine starlet Anselmino, 19, is off to Dortmund on loan – although the deal does not include an option to buy. Chelsea boss Enzo Maresca has told the teenager that minutes at the Bridge will be at a premium this season but he remains earmarked for a role in the future.",
      "West Ham's start to the season could get worse yet amid reports that Tottenham and Aston Villa are both weighing up a move for key midfielder Lucas Paqueta.",
      "The Hammers have had a disastrous start to the 2025-26 Premier League campaign after losing 3-0 to newly-promoted Sunderland on the opening day before a 5-1 hammering at home to Chelsea on Friday night.",
      "There is increasing pressure on manager Graham Potter already just two games into the season with fans getting restless and concerned with two trips to Nottingham Forest and Tottenham coming up.",
      "And there could be more trouble for the Hammers amid huge interest in Paqueta, who has just been cleared of wrongdoing amid an investigation into betting allegations.",
      "After a difficult period that saw him facing a lifetime ban from football, the Brazilian international is now keen to play for a Champions League side, according to the Daily Mail.",
      "Manchester United transfer target Senne Lammens has been left out of the squad for Royal Antwerp's clash with Mechelen as he inches closer to joining the Red Devils. Ruben Amorim is keen to sign a new goalkeeper, with Lammens set to provide competition for Andre Onana.",
      "Onana has come under fire since joining United from Inter Milan in 2023 after making several high-profile errors, but there is a lack of genuine competition for his spot as No.1. Onana did not make the squad for United's 1-0 defeat to Arsenal last weekend and backup goalkeeper Altay Bayindir was at fault for Riccardo Calafiori's winner.",
      "As a result, United are looking to sign Lammens for £17.3million and a deal appears to be very close after Antwerp did not select him against Mechelen. Yannick Thoelen was handed his first start of the season instead, while new signing Taishi Brandon Nozawa made the bench.",
      "Crystal Palace could land two new signings with the money they've raised from Eberechi Eze's sale - but the manager and the chairman are both eyeing different individuals.",
      "Oliver Glasner has seen few new faces arrive but the departure of his star man means he and the club must now act. The Sun reports that the ex-Frankfurt boss wants Club Brugge winger Christos Tzolis, who has been a big hit in Belgium after proving to be a flop at Norwich.",
      "Palace chairman Steve Parish though is keen on Villarreal's forward Yeremy Pino. Glasner though is unclear how the 22-year-old Spaniard would fit into the team, casting doubt over his signing.",
      "The Eagles though hope that both men can be secured for around £20m, which means they could go after Pino and Tzolis if they wanted to give the money they've just raised from Eze.",
      "Aston Villa loss at Brentford on Saturday and they've been largely quiet this summer, but Unai Emery still wants to know where everyone stands.",
      "“We have to clarify some circumstances we have in the transfer window,\" said the Spaniard after the game.",
      "We have enough players but we need to clarify with some players if they are staying or not, and the possibility we can add some to help us.”",
      "Sky Germany claims that Bayern Munich have discussed potentially signing Manchester United duo Rasmus Hojlund and Jadon Sancho - which would be a hugely left field move from the Germans.",
      "Ruben Amorim is keen to move both on from Old Trafford and the Bundesliga champions could now enter the race.",
      "Sancho has history of excelling in Germany, previously being a hugely influential figure at Borussia Dortmund. Hojlund though would be more of an unknown.",
      "Borussia Dortmund are confident of completing a deal to sign Carney Chukwuemeka from Chelsea on a permanent transfer.",
      "The midfielder joined the Blues in 2022 after being tipped for big things at Aston Villa, but his minutes have been limited by injury and he's not currently part of the plans in west Lodon.",
      "Dortmund are expected to pay €20m plus add-ons for the player, who spent half of last season on loan with them.",
      "According to a report from AS, Manchester United are among a host of clubs interested in signing Crystal Palace midfielder Adam Wharton.",
      "The report states that Real Madrid, Manchester City and Liverpool are also interested in the 21-year-old, who has impressed since making the step up from the Championship to the Premier League last year.",
      "There was no place in the Brentford squad for Yoane Wissa, who is pushing for a move away from the club, as the Bees saw off Aston Villa.",
      "The striker is looking to secure himself a move to Newcastle and his boss felt it was best he was missing.",
      "\"I felt it was right for the group,\" said Keith Andrews. \"We needed a group today that was absolutely committed to showing what we're about. Identity, what this club is and how it's been built. I felt it was the right decision not to include Yoane today.\"",
      "Man United captain Bruno Fernandes is being targeted by Saudi clubs again - this time it is Al Ittihad who want him, according to The Sun.",
      "Fernandes was subject to interest from interest from Al Hilal earlier in the window, but wanted to remain playing in Europe, which suggests he has no interest.",
      "United will leave the 30-year-old to make his own decision again, as they did earlier this summer. It is understood that talks with Fernandes' camp have already taken place and Al Ittihad are willing to pay the midfielder £33m per year.",
      "RB Leipzig director Marcel Schafer has issued an update on Xavi Simons and admits the Dutchman could yet move to Chelsea.",
      "He told Sky Germany: “Xavi Simons is still with us. But the market is still open, you never know what might happen. Xavi has expressed his ambitions to us.”",
      "Man Utd continue to negotiate with Royal Antwerp for Senne Lammens as they look to bolster their goalkeeper ranks.",
      "The Red Devils are said to have offered £14.7m plus add-ons, but the Belgian side are demanding more and want close to £21.6m if they are to let their shotstopper leave for Old Trafford.",
      "Ruben Amorim has made it clear that the arrival of a new goalkeeper will not mean one has to leave.",
      "Eddie Howe insists Newcastle will not be left without a striker as the Alexander Isak saga continues to play out.",
      "He was quizzed about the prospect of losing Isak without a replacement coming in, but he doesn't see that as a scenario that will play out.",
      "Howe said: “I don’t think the club will allow that situation to happen. We certainly can’t go through the season with no recognised striker at the football club.\"",
      "Mikel Arteta is adamant that Eberechi Eze will add another dynamic to the Arsenal attack after his move was completed on Saturday.",
      "He said: “We are absolutely delighted to bring Eberechi to Arsenal. He is a powerful and exciting player who will give us a new dimension in our attacking game. What stands out just as much as his talent and intelligence as a player, is the way he has worked hard throughout his career to get where he is today.",
      "\"His journey, his mentality, and his ambition are exactly what we want in our team, and we love how much it means to him and his family to be joining our club. We all look forward to start working with Eberechi soon.”",
      "We're back to bring you all the latest - stay with us as we bring you the latest gossip and any done deals!"

      "Dimitar Berbatov admitted Sir Alex Ferguson's treatment of him led to his acrimonious Manchester United departure. The Bulgarian became the Red Devils' most expensive player in 2008 when they forked out £30.75million to prise him away from Tottenham Hotspur.",
      "After scoring 21 Premier League goals in his first two seasons combined at Old Trafford, Berbatov netted 20 goals in his third season, which not only clinched his second league title in England but his first Golden Boot honour.",
      "Despite coming off what was the second-best scoring season of his career, Berbatov found games hard to come by the following season, as he appeared in just 12 league games, while scoring seven.",
      "In the last 15 games of the 2011/12 season, the former striker had just 28 minutes of action to his name. The frustration felt by Berbatov at the time could be traced back to the season prior where he was left out of the squad by Ferguson for United's 3-1 defeat to Barcelona in the Champions League final.",
      "The 2011/12 campaign turned out to be the last Berbatov would be a United player as he opted to sign for Fulham. Upon his arrival in west London, he didn't hold back when revealing how his fractured relationship with Ferguson was created, admitting he wouldn't say goodbye to the Scotsman when leaving the club.",
      "Speaking in 2012 to The Guardian, he said: \"I don't think I deserved such treatment at United – not playing in the last year. I went more than 10, probably 15, times to ask the coach if they need me.",
      "\"And every time I was told that I'm an important player and should not leave, but then again I was not in the team. Maybe I should've gone when he [Ferguson] left me out of the squad for the Champions League final [in 2011]. I know he's the boss, but he has lost, to some extent, my respect because of the way he treated me.\"",
      "Berbatov revealed the writing was on the wall for him at United after he was informed by Ferguson of his decision to change the team's style of play. \"He [Ferguson] tried to explain to me that the team will be using a more direct style, with more speed,\" he explained.",
      "\"But I've never been among the fastest players, I like to hold the ball, this is my style. I found it hard to accept his decision – I still have my dignity. I scored many goals, I won the league two times, and I was the league top scorer, so it's not bad.",
      "\"I'll have no problems playing against United as this already happened in my career. But there's no point to look back again. I said goodbye to the people, who deserve it. I couldn't say goodbye to Ferguson.\"",
      "Berbatov was 31 years old when signing for the Cottagers, but that didn't stop him from continuing to be one of England's most potent strikers as he scored 15 league goals in his debut campaign.",
      "He played just one more year in England before departing for Monaco. After two years in the Principality, he enjoyed short stints with PAOK and Kerala Blasters before retiring from football in 2018.",
      "Berbatov will surely be a keen viewer when United and Fulham clash at Craven Cottage on Sunday afternoon with kick-off set for 4.30pm.",

      "Andreas Pereira revealed he dodged a conversation with Erik ten Hag to force through his exit from Manchester United. The Brazilian, who now plays for Fulham, insisted it was the best decision of his career as he sought regular first-team football and a sense of being \"loved\" by fans.",
      "Pereira left for Fulham in 2022, with the London club snapping him up in a £8.6million (rising to £10m) deal. Ten Hag had only just arrived at Old Trafford, but after years of limited opportunities under previous managers, Pereira wasn't willing to wait and see if his fortunes would improve under the new boss.",
      "After three consecutive loan spells, Pereira saw Fulham - United's Premier League opponents this Sunday - offering him the stability he had been missing. It was an opportunity he felt he couldn't turn down.",
      "\"This was when I came back to England [after my loan],\" Pereira told United legend Rio Ferdinand on his Rio Ferdinand Presents show. \"Erik ten Hag, he worked at PSV when I was 16 years old.",
      "\"Before leaving for United, the [PSV] president and Erik ten Hag came to speak to me and my dad and said, 'Look everything is set up for you at PSV, if you stay here you're going to play in the first team'. But I'd just been to United and spoke with Fergie. I was like, 'I'm going to United'.",
      "\"That's why I didn't want to speak to Erik because I knew him and I knew that, at the time, it was always a conversation, like, 'Andreas, stay here. You're not going to play every game, maybe one game in every three, you'll be around the squad'. That's not what I wanted, I wanted to play.\"",
      "Pereira, 29, came through United's youth ranks after joining from PSV Eindhoven in 2011, making 75 appearances for the first team. However, his time at the club was marked by inconsistency and stints on the sidelines, with loan spells at Granada, Valencia, Lazio, and Flamengo limiting his opportunities under various managers.",
      "Upon returning from a successful period in Brazil with Flamengo in 2022, Pereira was determined to leave permanently. The decision wasn't easy, as Pereira admitted to second-guessing himself amid the prestige of staying at the Theatre of Dreams.",
      "\"Leaving United, you're like, 'Am I really going to do this? Am I sure?' In the end, you're never 100 per cent sure, really. Sometimes you think stay and have another go. Other times, you have to leave,\" he said.",
      "A key factor was his desire for consistent minutes, coupled with a yearning to reconnect with his Brazilian roots. He nearly joined Everton before opting for Flamengo on loan.",
      "\"I wanted to play, after COVID, I wanted to play. I was going crazy, wanting to play in the Premier League. I wanted to show that I was good enough, I was very close to joining [Everton] and suddenly my father called me and said, ‘Andreas, you never played in Brazil, you're Brazilian,'\" Pereira recalled.",
      "\"I wanted to play in Brazil and want to feel loved. I didn't feel the love that I thought I should get. I wanted to feel loved by my own people, play close to my family and enjoy football.\"",
      "Despite warnings from United staff that a move to Brazil might end his European career - \"Everyone at United said, 'You're crazy, you'll stay in Brazil, you'll never come back to Europe',\" - Pereira proved them wrong. He returned to the Premier League with Fulham, where he has flourished under Marco Silva.",
      "In 119 appearances, he has contributed 10 goals and 22 assists, becoming a midfield linchpin and even drawing interest from Chelsea, who eyed him as a replacement for Conor Gallagher in 2024. In three years at the West London club he's been left out of just eight Premier League games - with six of those due to an ankle injury in 2023.",
      "He was, however, an unused sub in Fulham's opening day draw with Brighton last weekend. The Cottagers snatched a point late on thanks to an injury-time equaliser scored by Rodrigo Muniz.",
      "Sunday's clash with United not only offers Pereira the chance to work his way back into the starting XI, but also to prove a point to his former club and demonstrate how far he's come. His bold choice to sidestep Ten Hag and seek a fresh start has paid dividends, transforming him from a United fringe player into a Premier League mainstay.",
      "As the two teams lock horns this evening, Pereira's story serves as a testament to the value of betting on oneself -even if it means leaving a giant like Manchester United behind.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "United started brightly with Matheus Cunha hitting the post in the opening two minutes before being denied by a smart stop from Bernd Leno. United were awarded a penalty following a VAR review after Calvin Bassey hauled Mason Mount to the ground but Bruno Fernandes fired his effort well over the bar.",
      "Leny Yoro’s header found the back of the net via a deflection off Rodrigo Muniz as United took the lead in the second half but Emile Smith Rowe drew the home side level.",
      "Here are how the players rated at Craven Cottage:",
      "Altay Bayindir",
      "Made a couple of straightforward stops but resembled a schoolboy in an underage match at corners. Had no chance for the goal. 5",
      "Leny Yoro",
      "Another unflappable performance from the teenager. Great tackle on Josh King before he helped force the breakthrough in the 58th minute. 8",
      "Matthijs de Ligt",
      "Had the measure of Rodrigo Muniz, United's scourge the last time Fulham beat them in the league. Marshalled the defence impressively. 7",
      "Luke Shaw",
      "An assured performance from the reinvented defender, now a full-time centre back, for an hour. Blindsided by Smith Rowe for the equaliser. 6",
      "Amad",
      "The only change to the team, Amad smacked his thighs in frustration in the first half at not getting enough of the ball. Rallied to force a save early in the second half but came off with Casemiro. 6",
      "Casemiro",
      "A solid enough presence against a lightweight Fulham midfield until he got booked on 39 minutes. Did not last long in the second as he walked the tightrope. 5",
      "Bruno Fernandes",
      "Failed for only the fifth time from 12 yards, having converted three penalties during pre-season. Not his most creative of afternoons and failed to spot Smith Rowe. 5",
      "Patrick Dorgu",
      "Endeavoured to offer width but did not provide much service for the United front three. Not as attack-minded as in pre-season. Stayed on by default. 4",
      "Mason Mount",

      "At 1-1 in the 83rd minute, the Manchester United fans implored the players to \"attack, attack, attack\". Ruben Amorim sent on two centre backs.",
      "Including pre-season, it is now eight successive halves that a United starter has failed to score from open play. That sequence started with the removal of Rasmus Hojlund from the team.",
      "A team crying out for a new striker has signed a new one. Benjamin Sesko only walked onto the turf before kick-off to get to the dugout in the Riverside Stand. Sesko came on 13 minutes earlier than on his debut and looked rustier.",
      "Harry Maguire's and Ayden Heaven's 87th-minute introductions will have been to manage the workload of their fellow centre halves yet it was a questionable look. Typically, the threatening Maguire almost nodded United ahead with his first touch.",
      "Four of the five players who came on for United in the second half are defensive players. Kobbie Mainoo was unused for a second successive week.",
      "Amorim's game management was too cautious and too soon after United went ahead. Manuel Ugarte, mired in a crisis of confidence, arrived to hasten Fulham's equaliser. Diogo Dalot, his fellow substitute, committed a familiar sin for Emile Smith Rowe's equaliser, inviting the wideman to cross.",
      "The Ugarte substitution seemed premature but United had already withdrawn. Within four minutes of the defensive change, Fulham equalised through substitute Smith Rowe's first touch. Fulham avoided defeat at home to United for the first time in 15 years.",
      "United were perfecting their dead-ball kicks before kick-off. The practice made perfect. A week on from Arsenal cornering United, it was their turn. Bryan Mbeumo was sizing up crosses during the warm-up and he will be claiming his first assist for his new club from a corner.",
      "Leny Yoro may dispute that. Yoro was credited for the goal yet it went in off Rodrigo Muniz's back. Yoro has quietly had a fine calendar year and it is already unlikely that his €70million fee will ever be mentioned in incredulous tones.",
      "Three minutes before Yoro helped force the breakthrough, he executed a masterful sliding tackle on Josh King. A defender increasingly playing on the front foot, Yoro was an inheritance that Amorim was always bound to be pleased with.",
      "The United supporters bellowed Yoro's name. A defender's deviated effort decided this fixture last season. Not this time.",
      "Even with £133.5m worth of new forwards in the attacking trident, goals are still hard to come by for United. Bruno Fernandes skied a penalty, his first failure from 12 yards since December 2023, and only his fifth misfire from United's record penalty scorer.",
      "Casemiro could not watch. Normally, it is safe to watch Fernandes stepping up from 12 yards. He converted three in pre-season. It was uncharacteristic that he missed the meaningful one.",
      "There was the usual outrage from a ground's denizens at perceived favouritism towards the big club in town. Their mood only worsened through the intervention of the Video Assistant Referee and the robotic announcement from on-pitch official Chris Kavanagh. Mason Mount was referred to as \"the Manchester player\". With the lengthy stoppage and grandstanding address, it felt like the other football American audiences are accustomed to.",
      "Andre Onana stepped off the United coach via the rear entrance and had his headphones on. For such a bubbly personality, his stern expression was a giveaway.",
      "Altay Bayindir and Onana enjoy a collegiate relationship though the latter would have had to perfect his poker face after Fulham realised the easiest route to a goal was through crosses and corners. Bayindir resembled a school pupil in the wrong age group. It was a quirk of the afternoon that United had the fulfilment of scoring from one of the quadrants.",
      "Mount assumed more responsibility with and without the ball, using it to feed Cunha for two shots inside the first two minutes. During breaks in play, Mount ushered Patrick Dorgu back into position, ready to initiate United's press himself, and encouraged Amad amid his complaint with the linesman.",
      "Amorim mentioned Mount as an option in midfield. Amorim reactively hooked Casemiro, booked and dicing with death again, in the 52nd minute and Mount dropped back next to Fernandes to underpin United's £200m frontline. This was the Mount United thought they were signing.",
      "Cunha slotted in one of the goals of last season at the Hammersmith End by trapping a long ball and finishing in one motion. He almost produced a sequel, alas Bernd Leno repelled his close-range effort. Cunha's expression was a familiar one of a forward wondering what he had to do to score.",
      "The Brazilian was soon tugged back cynically in the centre circle and there was a brief flicker of the frustration that blighted some of his appearances for Wolves with an outburst at the referee. Casemiro quickly assuaged Cunha.",
      "Amorim, casually clad in an unzipped Adidas tracksuit top and white t-shirt, beckoned United forward as early as the 26th minute. A dash of impatience was forgivable after United approached the two-hour mark without a goal this month. Amad smacked his thighs in frustration at not receiving the ball. When Casemiro attempted to force the issue, he overhit his pass.",
      "A minute later, Amorim outstretched his arms in exasperation and demanded an explanation as to why United had played the ball from Fulham's half into their own. The tracksuit jacket was discarded for the second half.",
      "It was a warm day in west London. Amorim is also bound to be hot under the collar when United can buy three new forwards but not buy a goal from open play.",

      "The only outright attacking change by the United head coach was the introduction of new striker Benjamin Sesko as Mainoo and striker Joshua Zirkzee remained in the dugout.",
      "Mason Mount dropped back into central midfield following the substitution of Casemiro with the game goalless. Defensive midfielder Manuel Ugarte replaced Mount in the 69th minute with United 1-0 up.",
      "Mainoo, 20, is likely to make his first appearance of the season in the League Cup second round tie at Grimsby Town on Wednesday but he has started in only 15 of Amorim's 44 matches in charge.",
      "Amorim favours an attacking midfielder and a defensive midfielder in his 3-4-2-1 system and Fernandes remains an automatic pick.",
      "\"He’s fighting for the position now with Bruno,\" Amorim said of Mainoo. \"And I change two midfielders. I let Mason Mount [play] there because we want to score a goal and when I changed I felt the team need to return to one holding midfielder near Bruno.",
      "\"So he (Mainoo) just needs to fight for the position with Bruno, as [it] should be at Manchester United. [Sometimes] he’s going to play with Bruno, but at the moment he’s fighting in training with Bruno for the position.\"",
      "Since Rasmus Hojlund came out of the team in pre-season, United have scored one goal from open play in four matches. Amorim started a strikerless side for the second Premier League game running as Sesko emerged in the second half but United's only goal was an own goal by Rodrigo Muniz.",
      "United won two of their five pre-season matches and both came with Hojlund starting up front. Amorim rejected the suggestion the players have had to adapt to a new approach without a centre forward.",
      "\"I think it’s a normal thing when you reach this level,\" he added. \"Cunha can play as a striker and as a 10. I felt that during these last games with Mason Mount sometimes we are more robust in the way we play.",
      "\"So we are going to change according to the result and the opponent and try to win games.\"",

United were awarded a penalty following a VAR review after Calvin Bassey hauled Mason Mount to the ground but Bruno Fernandes fired his effort well over the bar.",
      "Leny Yoro’s header found the back of the net via a deflection off Muniz as United took the lead in the second half but Smith Rowe drew the home side level.",

      "United are finally ahead at Craven Cottage thanks to a corner, and they deserve a lead.",
      "That had to happen with Casemiro. It’s bold of Amorim to go without Ugarte, but that is a reflection of how well Mount has played. United are also not winning, either, so the emphasis has to be on the attack. Mount had to stay on, given how well he’s performed and Amorim only said last week he could slot into midfield when needed.",

It was worse than the robotic announcement from the referee, who may have referred to the United player as “Manchester player”. It was like watching the NFL.",

      "Bruno Fernandes steps up but fires his effort well over the bar.",
      "This should be given - Bassey brought down Mount from the corner.",
      "Fulham must feel like they’ve ridden out the storm. United have had the standout chance of the game but have hardly been dominant. Bayindir has brushed glass clippings off his gloves after a couple of saves and United’s early intensity has subsided. Both sides have had two attempts on target and the same number of shots (five).",
      "Amad has just slapped his hands against his thighs. Casemiro then tried to force the issue with an overhit pass. Amad has been underused but that isn’t necessarily a criticism of United as they have gone down the middle for their two best chances/opportunities.",
      "Cunha has been brilliant to watch again. It’s a pity for him and for United he’s not been able to change the scoreboard as he has been the best player out there.",
      "Rodrigo Muniz is starting to look a little frustrated. He’s just had quite an animated exchange with Alex Iwobi about something or other. Fulham have not targeted Muniz that often, though when they did at Old Trafford 18 months ago United had Victor Lindelof in their defence."

      "Manchester United are set to win the race to sign goalkeeper Senne Lammens from Royal Antwerp, it has been claimed. The Reds have been monitoring the Belgian shot-stopper for the past 12 months and have lined up a £16million plus add-ons deal to bring him to Old Trafford before the end of the summer.",
      "Lammens is said to be keen on a move to United, reports the Mirror, and has made it his preferred destination, despite interest from Galatasaray, Inter Milan and Lille. Ruben Amorim's side are now looking to seal an agreement with the player, although Galatasaray lodged an 11th-hour bid on Saturday night to try and steal the 'keeper.",
      "The proposed arrival of the 23-year-old is expected to cast doubt on the long-term future of Andre Onana. The Cameroon international was left out of Amorim's squad for last Sunday's defeat against Arsenal and remained out of the XI to face Fulham in United's second Premier League game of the season.",
      "Altay Bayindir started United's top-flight curtain-raiser, and although he made a guilt-edge mistake leading to Arsenal's winner, Amorim decided against making a change in goal for the trip to Fulham. Onana returned to the squad but had to settle for a place on the bench, with Bayindir starting once again.",
      "Onana, a £47m signing from Inter Milan two years ago, has been inconsistent during his time at United but may now consider his future.",
      "Lammens, meanwhile, was left out of the Royal Antwerp squad to face Mechelen in the Jupiler Pro League on Sunday. The former Belgium under-21 international had played in each of Antwerp's first four league matches, but he didn't feature in their fifth outing - a game in which they won 2-1 with an 80th minute winner.",
      "Elsewhere, United are anticipated to focus on getting players out of the door before the end of the transfer window on Monday, September 1. Amorim admitted on Friday that it is not a good situation to still have four wantaway stars still at United but says \"anything can happen\" if they do not find a suitable solution.",

      "He added: \"I can't say too much before I get a fine. Not enough force? Come on. It's a foul. When you go up to jump, any little touch can put you off.",
      "\"He's got two hands [on me], how much force do you need? I told him, they've got a rule only the captain can speak to him, they haven't checked it.",

      "In the 53rd minute of Manchester United's 1-1 draw at Fulham on Sunday, Ruben Amorim made a decision that produced more questions than answers, one that will need addressing before the transfer window closes.",
      "United took on Fulham at Craven Cottage looking to win for the first time this season after last week's defeat to Arsenal. There wasn't a lot to split the two sides in the first-half with Bruno Fernandes' missed penalty the key talking point.",
      "After the break, Amorim gave his starting 11 just eight minutes to convince him that something was coming before changes were made. In the 53rd minute, the United boss brought off Amad for Diogo Dalot and introduced Benjamin Sesko, replacing Casemiro.",
      "The tweak in personnel saw Mason Mount, who had played as a false nine, partner Bruno Fernandes in midfield and Sesko leading the line. Predominately an attack-minded midfielder, Mount was favoured by Amorim to play a position Manuel Ugarte and Kobbie Mainoo are natural in.",
      "Last season, the two midfielders played a combined 82 games and there were only seven games - of the 60 United played in total - where neither featured. Following a summer where United's midfield has been under the microscope in the transfer window, the decision seems strange.",
      "After Leny Yoro's opener, United did introduce Ugarte for Mount after it became apparent that Fulham were running things in the middle of the park before two more players came on, but no sign of Mainoo.",
      "The transfer rumour mill has linked United with a catalogue of central midfielders throughout the window. At the start of the window, Joao Palhinha - who went on to join Tottenham - and Richard Rios were both linked with Corentin Tolisso, Wilfred Ndidi, Ederson, Morten Hjulmand and Felix Nmecha all following them.",
      "There is just over a week until the transfer window and there is still scope of the club signing a new midfielder, although very slim. Senne Lammens is closing in on providing more competition in the goalkeeper department but Amorim's seeming persistence to ignore Mainoo does create hope of a new midfielder coming in.",

Lammens, who was called up to the Belgium national team squad earlier this year but is yet to attain a cap, would fit that billing.

      "When the Manchester United teamsheet dropped at 3.15pm on Sunday, a fair few jaws dropped with it.",
      "The decision not to start with an out-and-out striker, with Mason Mount asked to provide a focal point for United's new-look attack, instantly looked dubious. But with Benjamin Sesko still settling in and Ruben Amorim experimenting with a false nine in pre-season, it wasn't really a shock.",
      "Amorim had refused to confirm whether Andre Onana would return in goal at his pre-match press conference just two days earlier, and so Altay's Bayindir's inclusion wasn't necessarily a shock either, as costly as that call proved to be.",
      "The third contentious call was in midfield, but with Casemiro having started United's biggest game in decades just months earlier and Manuel Ugarte failing to impress on a consistent basis in pre-season, a lot of fans saw it coming.",
      "All three decisions set alarm bells ringing, but with added context they at least looked understandable.",
      "The same cannot be said for Amorim's selection at right wing-back.",
      "As one of only two players to start all five of United's pre-season friendlies, Amad's place in the starting XI against Arsenal was one of the few you could confidently say was nailed on before the team news arrived.",
      "In a season so bereft of bright spots, Amad's emergence was one of the few positives to take from a truly dismal campaign. Having been overlooked for so long, and given the dark clouds hanging over the club for the majority of last season, his drive and ability to give fans something to cling onto last season truly were a testament to his character as much as his quality.",
      "Having carried United for so long last season alongside Bruno Fernandes, new signings Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha were meant to provide support for Amad when it came to carrying the attacking burden. Yet instead their inclusion in the starting XI meant Amorim felt he wasn't so dependent on Amad's attacking flair and he opted for the more defensive-minded Diogo Dalot instead.",
      "Dalot didn't do much wrong against Arsenal and he got into some good attacking positions, but he's never going to get fans on their feet like Amad, and the Ivory Coast international injected more energy into the attacks when he was introduced just before the hour mark.",
      "With no European football at Old Trafford this season, United's campaign could be limited to just 40 games, and will definitely be no longer than 51 games. The reduced workload means Amorim can afford to pick his best players week in, week out, in the Premier League at the very least.",
      "Amad absolutely is one of United's best players and shouldn't begin another league game from the bench.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Mainoo, 20, rejected United's initial proposal at the start of the calendar year and Chelsea were linked with a move for the midfielder in the winter transfer window.",
      "Although Mainoo has failed to regain his place in the United first team, their shortage of midfielders means he will almost certainly stay beyond the closure of the summer transfer window.",
      "Mainoo was 17 when he last signed a contract with United and his current deal expires in 2027 but the club has the option of an additional year.",
      "Amorim stressed it was director of football Jason Wilcox's responsibility to tie down players on new contracts. \"That part is with Jason, so he is our player. He has a contract, I didn’t hear any news about that.\"",
      "Mainoo has started only 15 times since Amorim was appointed head coach in November last year and the academy graduate was an unused substitute in United's opening Premier League defeat to Arsenal.",
      "Amorim started Bruno Fernandes and Casemiro in midfield against the Premier League runners up and Mainoo was trialled as one of the two playmakers and even as a striker last season.",
      "The England international suffered two lengthy injury lay-offs last year and Amorim spoke optimistically about Mainoo's development during the pre-season tour but the Portuguese's 3-4-2-1 system has jarred with Mainoo's skill set.",
      "\"We play with two midfielders and it is a different way of playing,\" Amorim reiterated. \"They have to understand, the young players, there are phases in the season. Nowadays it's normal, with a lot of games, things are going to change. But he is there, he is fighting, he is training, he is one more option for us to win games.\"",

      "Ruben Amorim was given a pre-season, £200m, more goodwill than most and the perfect opener against Arsenal. But his Manchester United just isn’t working.",
      "",
      "‘Manchester United have trampled over too many green shoots of promise they have only just planted to engender much faith in this latest long-term plan. Their modern history contains more false dawns than a Vicar of Dibley convention. Do this against Fulham and Burnley before the international break and we’ll start believing this might be different.’",
      "Ruben Amorim would struggle to get Journey on board at this rate.",
      "There was a kickback against the general positive slant given to what was ultimately a 17th defeat in 43 matches as Manchester United manager for the Portuguese last week. But in most quarters the praise was tempered.",
      "It was good and could have been better but was also not indicative of the barometer against which this coach and team ought to be judged.",
      "A home opener against an Arsenal side not yet up to speed was almost the ideal game. It brought low pressure to match expectation levels which have dropped through the actual floor based on last season. A halfway decent performance was always going to be painted in a bright light rather than dull, depressing greys.",
      "The reaction was somewhat driven by the narrative on both sides: it is more interesting for Manchester United to be better this campaign; it is funnier for Arsenal to miss out on the title again. Only one of those possibilities has lasted the week.",
      "Manchester United cannot be trusted. Nor Amorim, who has been furnished with a £200m summer spend amid redundancies and claims of imminent bankruptcy to achieve an arguable slight uptick in performances despite also being granted the silver bullet of a pre-season.",
      "And that absolutely does carry relevance in the face of these results. The increasingly absurd, cruel decisions made by Sir Jim Ratcliffe and INEOS have been justified all along as a necessary and unavoidable part of delivering Manchester United back to where they supposedly should be. If that process fails, what was it all really for?",
      "Nothing has really changed. Manchester United still start games well, still have moments of genuine ingenuity and cohesion going forward, still concede thoroughly preventable goals through a series of individual and collective mistakes in the middle and at the back, and still end with Harry Maguire as their chosen desperate route to goal.",
      "And when almost that entire £200m spend has been reserved for completely remodelling the attack, at least two of those enduring traits going back at least to last season and arguably well beyond are close to unforgivable.",
      "Matheus Cunha was electric before quickly becoming static, his three shots and single pass leading to a shot all coming in the first 15 minutes. Bryan Mbeumo did an awful lot of running for little reward. Some moves were slick, with speed of thought, flicks, a crispness in execution and technique.",
      "But their biggest first-half chances came from a long Altay Bayindir kick and a relatively contentious penalty – it was ultimately stupid defending from Calvin Bassey – which Bruno Fernandes skied.",
      "MORE MANCHESTER UNITED COVERAGE FROM F365\n👉 Fernandes receives ‘disproportionate offer’ as ‘Monday turning point’ revealed amid ‘meeting’\n👉 Romano confirms Man Utd ‘close to fee agreement’ as next signing ‘left out’ of squad – ‘deal advanced’",
      "Even the opening goal was a deflected header from a corner as Leny Yoro followed up an excellent tackle on Josh King but expertly nodding a shot off the back of Rodrigo Muniz.",
      "There was no semblance of Manchester United wanting to capitalise on that fortunate breakthrough. The next four shots all came from Fulham, culminating in an equaliser scored by a substitute only just introduced.",
      "Emile Smith Rowe, Raul Jimenez, Harry Wilson and Antonee Robinson all gave the hosts something different; Diogo Dalot gave the ball away for that goal, Benjamin Sesko offered nothing and Manuel Ugarte was similarly ineffective before Maguire and Ayden Heaven were chucked on to give the impression of maximising set-pieces.",
      "Each new player was sacrificed to a system which doesn’t appear to work, subsumed by the flow of the game rather than dictating it. Manchester United’s changes were timid and Fulham’s were brave – although they had to be as they were chasing the game – and the performances reflected that.",
      "Manchester United are stuck. They have yielded so much to Amorim in serving his specific philosophy and publicly ostracising and depreciating high-value players – hello, unused substitute Kobbie Mainoo – that these results, especially after going deep into the overdraft of goodwill last season, should not be accepted and indeed ought to result in his sacking. Yet they have also gone too far down that road to stop now for fear of having completely wasted their time all along.",
      "It is why the modest improvements will be amplified beyond all meaning while the familiar failings are excused and ignored, at least by those blinded by the past or in a position of power to do anything about it.",
      "But there are precious few signs of actual sustained change. The best Amorim can conjure after being granted a summer reset even he conceded was entirely undeserved is more of the same. He is the anti-Klopp: turning doubters into people who might never believe again.",
      "Ruben Amorim kept coy on a new Man Utd’s hunt for a new goalkeeper but warned the club’s bomb squad it’s on them to secure exits.",
      "Manchester United are ‘accelerating’ to secure a £35m midfielder after Ruben Amorim ‘failed to convince’ the Red Devils board to sign an Aston Villa star.",

      "Ruben Amorim is already in a battle to keep his job at Manchester United; they cannot finish outside the top six.",
      "Ruben Amorim has had his first rant of the season after a reporter suggested Tom Heaton would have been a better choice between the sticks.",

      "This summer there’s been a greater than usual number of Premier League managers openly complaining about their club’s inability to get enough transfer business done, even if most have been more sensibly diplomatic about it than Nuno Espirito Santo.",
      "The Nottingham Forest boss, Everton’s David Moyes, Crystal Palace’s Oliver Glasner, Newcastle’s Eddie Howe and Fulham’s Marco Silva have all been outspoken about the issue – and the Cottagers make for a particularly interesting case study in the problem now facing a whole fleet of mid-table sides. Even Newcastle, a Champions League side, are struggling with it.",
      "After year upon year of adding to the squad, Fulham have had an uncharacteristically quiet summer transfer window. There’s something almost delightfully Rothmans retro about a Premier League side’s only business being the £500,000 signing of a 34-year-old back-up goalkeeper from Montpellier; their only departures have been a handful of routine free agent releases and loans, mostly to the Championship.",
      "Unlike some clubs, this seems to have nothing to do with Fulham taking a necessarily cautious approach due to the pressure of profit and sustainability rules; their position is reasonably strong compared with some other Premier League clubs.",
      "MORE PREMIER LEAGUE ON FOOTBALL365\n👉 Arsenal have a pivotal early-season moment – but is it Gyokeres’ goals or Saka setback?\n👉 Nottingham Forest should steal frustrated Glasner from Crystal Palace to solve ‘spectacular fallout’\n👉 Jack Grealish thrives in Everton spotlight as Brighton do an absolutely massive Brighton",
      "Rather, the issue facing clubs of their stature is one of pure supply and demand.",
      "If you’re newly-promoted and just need upgrades on a Championship squad, or if you have had almost your whole defence poached like Bournemouth, finding players who are an improvement on what you already have is relatively straightforward. If you have wallets and reputations the size of Chelsea’s, Liverpool’s, Manchester City’s, Manchester United’s, Tottenham’s and Arsenal’s, then you can afford to spend very big money on the very best players.",
      "But sides like Fulham are stuck in between. To establish yourself in mid-table security these days, on the whole your recruitment has to be incredibly well-optimised – especially with PSR in effect.",
      "Brentford, Brighton, Bournemouth and Fulham haven’t got where they are over the past few years by just having a flyer on someone they think might be alright – but the huge money available to them compared with even some of the biggest teams in Europe’s other leagues means they have been able to sign players of a standard that would never have been available to them a decade ago.",
      "The thing is that talented footballers are a finite resource – and six year into the TV money reaching truly astronomical levels, those who offer a substantial improvement on what the Premier League’s middle class already have is proving extremely difficult.",
      "Those who would do so are now only affordable to the big boys, or are increasingly leaving the big clubs not to join the mid-table pack, but to ply their trade abroad where they are more likely to find a club that can compete for trophies: Scott McTominay, Marcus Rashford, Jarrell Quansah, Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg, even Tyler bloody Morton. Thankfully for Fulham here, they had an exception to call on: Emile Smith Rowe, who signed from Arsenal last year.",
      "It does not help those clubs’ managers that for the same reasons, you really have to stuff things up big time to find yourself drawn into a relegation battle with the three sides coming up from the Championship.",
      "Chairmen and directors of football are now in a position where playing it safe and looking after their PSR position for the next transfer window is a far more sensible decision than spunking a load of cash on a punt and a hunch – especially when the same problem also affects the clubs immediately around you in the table.",
      "Whether that’s a good thing or a bad thing depends what you want from your football. Those supply problem means those who do manage to find gems at an affordable price will still be at an advantage. But it feels retrospectively inevitable that things would start to settle down at some point, and the Premier League, at least in mid-table, would return to being primarily about which clubs put their existing resources to best use.",
      "For purists who are more interested in tactics, coaching and academy graduates than they are in being able to brag about having won the transfer window on social media, that might not be the worst thing; it makes the football much more about managerial battles of wits rather than who can use Wyscout most effectively.",
      "The good news for those Fulham fans who are frustrated by their lack of transfer movement is that Marco Silva showed last year that he has grown to be a very savvy Premier League manager capable of getting results.",
      "Here, his introduction of Smith Rowe from the bench came at the perfect moment, with Fulham applying increasing pressure in search of an equaliser and just needing that finishing touch in the box. Silva has made those kind of substitutions a specialty: they’ve scored 19 from the bench since the beginning of last season, the most of any top-flight club.",
      "We’re not surprised by that stat at all. Fulham’s push towards the European qualification places last season was built on their shrewd manager making them extremely organised, disciplined and difficult to play against – traits they exhibited again in this game. The only (admittedly glaring) exceptions were in dealing with crosses, such as Calvin Bassey’s bizarre decision to turn into a judoka and hand the visitors a clear-cut penalty that Bruno Fernandes then blasted over the bar, and letting Leny Yoro rise unchallenged at a set piece to force the opener.",
      "But it’s bad news for league table mobility, and the chances of a side like Fulham closing the gap on the long-established wealthy elite are minimal. To do that, they need to upgrade their attacking options from the serviceable-but-not-outstanding players they already have. It certainly would have made the difference here, with Fulham firmly on top after drawing back level but unable to find a winner.",
      "Unfortunately, those kinds of players are the most problematic of all amid that supply and demand issue – two of the best from the middle reaches of the Premier League, Bryan Mbeumo and Mattheus Cunha, lined up against Fulham for Manchester United here.",
      "That kind of complaint is nothing new; football has ever been thus. But that’s the problem with being fabulously wealthy: it doesn’t really matter if you’re ranking yourself against your even richer acquaintances."

      "A worthy bet on Pep…\n60 minutes into Spurs vs Manchester City and City just do not look good at all. On the flip side spurs look excellent in all the ways they didn’t under Ange.",
      "Here’s a bet I think it’s worth placing – Pep Guardiola to leave before the season end. Not sacked but I think he’ll leave. Because I don’t think he really knows how to fix city. The stress will get to him again like last season when he tried to fight a Liverpool fan in the street and then he’ll announce that he’s leaving.",
      "It’s a long shot obviously but I think it’s genuinely worth a bet.",
      "I know they usually lose to spurs (how weird is it that almost every single spurs manager beats city?) but they don’t usually get schooled the way they are today. There’s a massive gulf in tactics, motivation, and organisation.\nLee",
      "READ: James Trafford mistake inevitable amid Ederson succession botched by Man City",
      "",
      "The new ‘weak link’ at Arsenal…\nWith the the goons buying Eze, I wonder if Arteta realises that he is now the weak link. One wonders if he has worked on trying to improve his coaching skills over the Summer to the point where he can add at least one alternative to his current one dimensional approach. Penny for Nwaneri’s thoughts too. We are led to believe he hesitated on signing his new deal because of concerns about his minutes. Fair to assume then that he received assurances, because sign he did. Ten minutes later Eze struts in.\nRHT/TS x",
      "",
      "Potter in trouble…\nJust gonna call it as I see it, no shame losing to Chelsea.. 5-1 does raise plenty of questions particularly after a 3-0 to Sunderland.. They are bang in trouble.. looking at the fixtures don’t see them picking up a single point until late Oct (8/9 games in) Potter certain to be gone by then and West Ham in relegation flight this year for sure unless there is massive turnaround.\nChris (Broken Hammers)",
      "",
      "Arsenal = The Crazy Gang\nArsenal get a lot of hate in these here pages, but I for one enjoy the atavistic stylings they bring to the table. There’s something incredible about spending almost a BILLION pounds in order to bring Graham Taylor and Charles Reep’s dreams to the modern world.",
      "The Premier League of today is missing the antic energy, the pure fun of those lovable upstarts, the late 80s/early 90’s Wimbledon teams. Antagonistic manager, unlikable owner Sam/Stan, ball in the mixer, hilarious disciplinary record, scoring loads of scrappy goals from corners. I love that Arteta has attempted to recreate that style and bring fun and joy back to our sterile football world. He truly is a student of the game.",
      "Eze is the final piece. The cheeky chappy Dennis Wise figure who might even end up with a handful of England caps. He’s going to need to look out for the midfield Martins (a very 90’s British name) cutting his suit in half though! Or that big lump up front who scores four goals a season Big Victor Fashanu setting fire to his pants! How about ole David Raya/Beasant, ready to punch any one, any time the ball comes near him! Look out! And don’t mess about with this lot or Vinnie Rice will be right in with a reducer early doors!",
      "The brilliance of Arteta is to realize that the key to winning is not your fancy creativity in the final third of your Cities or you Liverpool’s, or your Wenger’s, no sir. What you need is to get the ball in the box high and early for the big man. He wins a corner or a long throw, then your other big lads crash the box and bundle it in! It’s the Arsenal way!",
      "I can hear Arsenal fans protesting right now. No! We pass the ball sometimes! Wimbledon never almost won the league! It’s all about marginal gains! (which I think is what you get by spending marginally less than a billion quid?) but I say why protest? You’re living the dream! Watching Arsenal every week is not a torturous slog akin to a five hour documentary on making paint, in Romanian, with no subtitles, no! It is pure, golden nostalgia. A throwback to a simpler time.",
      "Plus at the end of the day, you can taste other fans tears of jealousy with that ultimate measure of success ̶w̶i̶n̶n̶i̶n̶g̶ ̶t̶h̶e̶ ̶t̶r̶a̶n̶s̶f̶e̶r̶ ̶w̶i̶n̶d̶o̶w̶ trophies! Just like the original Crazy Gang*, this Arsenal team have, in total, one whole FA Cup triumph to savor. Who could want or expect more than that in almost six years? The endless grind was all worth it! I can hear the Emirates quietly singing now; “One trophy… to the Arsenal! One Trophy!’\nDrew, LA. (*to be fair to Wimbledon, they also achieved 3 promotions as well as the FA Cup triumph in the same time frame as Arteta has had, don’t want to cause any controversy with this missive.)",
      "",
      "Spurs ‘look mightily decent’ despite ‘Levy absolutely Levy’ing this transfer window\nI said it earlier this week in the mailbox and I’ll say it again now – after what was a calm and fuss-free performance from Spurs – but having your players play in their actual position with the correct set up is an understated element.",
      "Of course, conceding a record 497 goals and finishing one place above the relegation zone will always have the ‘your defence is sh*t’ line thrown at you. Negative. It was always the set up. These are very good players and, despite my reservations of Vic as a truly elite goalie, this back 5 has genuine potential to be very miserly indeed.",
      "Hard to get too excited after beating ‘just’ Burnley. And some may even argue that Spurs v City doesn’t count much either, because we have some curse over Pep, but I’m getting semi-excited. Not a semi though, don’t worry.",
      "It’s been a horrible week for Spurs on the old internet. This whole Eze thing has got the fanbase evoking Sol Campbell emotions. Which is weird. Eze, an Arsenal fan and once at their academy, decides to sign for *check notes*, oh, Arsenal. Hardly a f***ing surprise is it.",
      "Let me give you some advice, stay off socials and just watch the footy. It might leave you feeling happier and lighter.",
      "Anyway, despite Levy absolutely Levy’ing this transfer window – no MGW, Eze, Rodrygo, Rogers, Paz or the million others we’ve been linked with – we’ve got Frank coaching the team to play as a team and making us look mightily decent, even without key creative players in Madders and Kulu. He’s even got Richy looking like an actual football player, which he has very rarely done in a Lilywhite top.",
      "I’m not sure we get anyone else in. If we do, it’s probably underwhelming. The challenge will be when we are playing multiple games per week. For now, though, we look like a very decent prospect. I expect the top 4 to be Pool, City, Ars*nal and Ch*lsea. 5th? Who knows. Could we? Maybe. Qualification for a European comp would definitely represent success this season. That plus the CL and FA Cup. F*** it, and the league cup.",

      "And then Liverpool paying 120M+ for Isak, after spending 110M on wirtz. Good players but not anywhere box office enough for that money.",
      "For the most part, English clubs pay Gucci prices for Uniqlo players. And the media happily plays along saying we can’t compete with the Reals, Barcas and PSGs.

      "Logic not your strong point, I guess.",
      "Also, ftr, there is no comparison between Coutinho whilst playing for Liverpool and Isak in present day. Coutinho was far better – the conversation of the time was whether he or Hazard was better… and then they both went to Spain and flopped. Often, players don’t perform as well out of the environment that made them stars. Doesn’t mean they weren’t utterly fabulous for those clubs in the Premier League in a way that Isak can’t claim to be after just one season or so of superb football. If he can do it for, say, 5 years in a row, then sure.",
      "Also worth remembering that Newcastle are demanding 150% of the current British transfer record, and Liverpool are offering as an opening offer 110% of it. It’s not as if anyone is being stingy here.\nJon, Bridgwater.",
      "",
      "Isak, promises and perspectives…\nOn Isak. People keep pointing at the Coutinho deal like it somehow makes £150m for Isak reasonable. Come on. The Coutinho fee was Barca losing their minds after PSG nicked Neymar. Liverpool didn’t set a trend, they just cashed in and we’ve been laughing about it ever since. That doesn’t suddenly mean Isak is “worth” £150m.",
      "Newcastle can value him however they like, but let’s not pretend Isak agrees with them. I’d be stunned if he wasn’t told something along the lines of “if a big bid comes in, we’ll look at it.” A record bid did come in and Newcastle basically said “jog on.” No wonder the lad’s annoyed. Liverpool have already tested the water with £120m talk, and he can see it. If you were him, wouldn’t you feel stitched up?",
      "As for this “Liverpool don’t need another attacker” argument – nonsense. We’ve lost players, spaces need filling. This isn’t disruption, it’s evolution. You refresh a title-winning side or you fall behind. The new signings are bedding in fine, and another attacker doesn’t change that. The whole point is to set the squad up for the long term, not just this season.",
      "And Newcastle “acting like a big club” by clinging on? Please. Real big clubs know when to cash in, reinvest, and come back stronger. Newcastle look terrified of life without Isak because they know they can’t find anyone close. That’s not Liverpool’s problem, it’s theirs.",
      "And while I’m here, my last mail about the racist abuse of Semenyo and the disgraceful comments that followed never got published. Felt like a cop-out. The abuse was vile, but instead of focusing on supporting Semenyo, too many people in your comments used it as another excuse to bash Liverpool. That isn’t rivalry, it’s just bitter nonsense, and it lets the actual racist off the hook.",
      "So, back to football. £150m is silly money, Isak feels let down, Liverpool are evolving, Newcastle are clinging on, and this whole saga is dragging on longer than Odemwingie in a car park. At some point, they’ll either take the cash or they’ll end up with a striker who magically develops calf injuries every other week.\nLJ DUB – LFC stranded in Salford",

The only real tangible thing to build this doom-laden scenario upon is a lack of depth at centre-back, but still we keep coming back to the question: what if all those exciting new attacking players turn out to be massive disaster-flops?",
      "Most of our brain thinks they probably won’t f*ck it and might even be better than last season, but even that tiny idiot part convinced of pending disaster doesn’t think it could possibly materialise quickly or dramatically enough for Slot to be in any kind of danger before at least one other poor sod has been given the hook elsewhere.",

      "Especially as Spurs’ environment is… not like that one. He’s going to have a big job on to sort out an awful lot of mess at history’s funniest ever Champions League qualifiers. Remarkably, he appears to have already thoroughly De-Anged the lot of them.",

But while the Nuno comparisons are obvious, and a world in which Frank doesn’t make the November international break entirely possible, it doesn’t quite feel like the same situation.",

They could even have knocked out PSG in the Champions League after thar barnstorming Villa Park comeback.",

      "Still, though. Almost no chance that could happen swiftly enough for nobody else to have been canned first.

Ending up a clear best of the rest outside the quickly established top seven represented at least a passing grade and they’d have to make a truly awful start to the season to get in any kind of managerial-change bother.",

      "",
      "5=) Eddie Howe (Newcastle)\nAt various points we’ve expended daft amounts of energy attempting to manifest a ‘Howe Sack’ crisis because we’re messy bitches who live for drama. But we’ve never managed to make it stick even a tiny bit and we started the summer thinking there was little imminent prospect of going for it again with Howe the hero of the Geordie Nation for delivering silverware and more lovely, lovely Champions League football.",
      "Now, though, after a traumatic summer and the Alexander Isak Saga, our Spidey Sense is tingling once more. We’re going to be right back in the saddle come November after a run of two draws and a defeat leaves the Magpies seven points outside the top six.",
      "",
      "5=) Oliver Glasner (Crystal Palace)\nWon’t be sacked, obviously, because Palace are absolutely punching with an elite-level manager who is quietly delivering astonishing results in trying circumstances.",
      "Nailed it in the Community Shield, but as ever for clubs on Palace’s level there’s a positive-and-negative scale to be balanced by your manager catching the eye so conspicuously. Glasner absolutely could be poached with bigger beasts surely paying attention to the work he’s done at Selhurst Park.",
      "And if that poaching comes from outside the Premier League, then it comes with the possibility of making Glasner the first Premier League managerial casualty. But still very unlikely.",
      "",
      "5=) Daniel Farke (Leeds)\nIt would have made Spurs’ decision to sack Europa League-winning Ange Postecoglou look positively kind, but there remains a decent case that Leeds – and Burnley for that matter – could or even should have thanked the managers who secured 100 Championship points and got them back into the big time and then sent them on their way.",
      "Farke had a dreadful Premier League record of only six wins and 26 points from his 49 games in charge of Norwich, a team he twice led to promotion from the Championship with 94 and 97 points.",
      "As well as fighting his own record in this competition, Farke faces the added burden of expectation levels very different to those at just about any other club that could possibly find itself promoted into the Premier League in this current era where that represents the most bittersweet of successes.",
      "Leeds do look far better prepared than most for attempting the now fiendishly difficult first-season survival at this time, as victory over a disappointingly passive Everton suggested, but Farke lasted 11 games of the 21/22 season with Norwich and something similar absolutely cannot be ruled out this time.",
      "Arsenal away needn’t be a season-defining fixture, but Leeds had absolutely nothing to offer in that one from the moment the Gunners got going, which doesn’t bode well for future games against teams who aren’t as confused as Everton apparently are.",
      "",
      "5=) Ruben Amorim (Manchester United)\nFeels like one could, if one were so inclined, make the case for him being top of these odds but also bottom.",
      "Top because United were staggeringly and at times unwatchably bad last season, as well as bottling the Europa League final in truly dismal fashion against planet earth’s most notorious pot-dodgers. Bottom because United have so clearly and determinedly nailed their colours to the Amorim mast that even if they remain staggeringly and at times unwatchably awful they might just stick with him out of pure stubbornness.",
      "READ: Who will be the next Man Utd manager if Ruben Amorim is sacked?",
      "",
      "5=) Scott Parker (Burnley)\nFixture-list doom-mongery is a fool’s errand. One never truly knows before things get properly under way just who’s going to be good and who’s not. But Burnley really do have a horrible start under a manager with a horrible record at this level, and have already been given a clear reminder by the team that finished 17th last season of just how much harder the ‘simply don’t concede any goals at all’ tactic is going to be to deliver in the Premier League.",
      "Essentially, Burnley have got back to this level the same way Homer Simpson got to a heavyweight title fight. And Spurs have already given them a pummelling.",
      "Victory over Sunderland was an impressive and necessary reminder that it might still be enough against teams more on their level, but Parker will still need some fairly early evidence it can also work against established Premier League teams, which makes Burnley’s start so problematic and that win over Sunderland both vital yet potentially deceptive.",
      "We’ll know far more pretty soon given Burnley face Manchester United, Liverpool, Forest, Manchester City and Aston Villa before the first weekend of October is out. And Parker may well be too, ideally after a 9-0 defeat against Liverpool that he regards as unavoidable.",
      "",
      "4) Vitor Pereira (Wolves)\nWolves absolutely love a sh*tbone awful start and enforced managerial change around November. The loss of key players and a disappointingly limp finish to last season after that thrilling run of wins through March and April mean those old doubts were nagging away even before a woeful pre-season, an opening-day paddling from new-look, old-destructiveness Man City and a lacklustre defeat to a Bournemouth side with plenty of problems of their own.",
      "Pereira should be fine after the work he did in steering Wolves so comfortably clear of any relegation trouble last season, but making terrible starts that leave them in apparent relegation trouble before surviving comfortably in the end appears to now be ingrained in the club culture, an issue that transcends players and managers.",
      "",
      "3) Keith Andrews (Brentford)\nThe continuity candidate, but how much continuity can there be at Brentford given they’ve sold Bryan Mbeumo and Christian Norgaard, while Thomas Frank took most of the remaining coaching staff with him to Tottenham? It’s a very Brentford move to promote from within but will they be forced into the very un-Brentford move of sacking him in October when the Bees are in a relegation battle?",
      "A win over an Aston Villa side in the midst of their own funk certainly buys some time. At the very least it surely pushes any real sack talk firmly beyond the first international break, and this season that really might be enough to make you third manager out at worst.",
      "",
      "2) Graham Potter (West Ham)\nThat’s what a 3-0 defeat to a newly-promoted club and a 5-1 battering by Chelsea will do to you after a summer where little has gone right for West Ham. Sunderland and Chelsea were both very good, but the Hammers were honking on the opening day and arguably even worse on Friday night, with the perfectly rational view that Potter could not and should not be judged until he’d had the chance to get a pre-season’s worth of ideas across to his players already floundering.",
      "Hard to think of many teams who’ve more thoroughly propelled themselves into full ‘You fear for them’ territory so early in the season, and the very obvious extension of that fear is a similar one for Potter.",
      "Really is wild now to think of just how high his standing was during his Brighton days. If he can’t turn things round at West Ham, and it really is starting to look like he can’t, it’s really hard to see what the next step on this career path will be.",
      "",
      "1) Nuno Espirito Santo (Nottingham Forest)\nAlways felt possible, didn’t it? Even after such a fine season last year, even after managing to get their European ticket upgraded. Maybe especially after those things. Mr Marinakis is on one, and anyone who stands in his way is at risk.",
      "There are whispers already and Nuno actually now appears to be doing his level best to win this race in order to escape Evangelos Marinakis, who is apparently minded to bring Ange Postecoglou straight back to the Premier League. Think we can all agree that relationship would be one to savour, although Spurs fans might feel that going straight from Nuno to Postecoglou without Antonio Conte being a big miserable sod in the middle is basically cheating.",
      "Arsenal face a nervous wait on Kai Havertz after a knee setback, with Mikel Arteta confirming he’s unavailable to face Leeds United.",
      "According to reports, Arsenal boss Mikel Arteta has made a key decision on Viktor Gyokeres, who has been blasted after his ‘non-existent’ debut.",
      "Mikel Arteta has reportedly ‘identified’ Arsenal’s ‘next signing’ and Fabrizio Romano has backed them to pull off a last-minute transfer on one condition.",
      "Manchester United at Old Trafford may just be the worst possible opening day fixture for Mikel Arteta and Arsenal. We can feel the sack chat in our bones already.",
      "Former Tottenham Hotspur midfielder Jamie O’Hara believes Arsenal will sack Mikel Arteta if the Gunners don’t win a trophy this season.",
      "Arsenal legend Tony Adams has told Mikel Arteta to strip Martin Odegaard of the captaincy and give it to Declan Rice if he wants to be a winner."

      "We’re so back. The 25/26 Premier League season is up and running, and halfway through the second weekend, there’s already been significant early jostling in the marathon-not-a-sprint for the Golden Boot.",
      "There’s already a very strong, very familiar favourite heading a strong group of contenders featuring plenty of new names.",
      "Here are the 10 current favourites for the big shiny shoe, according to oddschecker.com, with each player’s current goal tally in brackets.",
      "",
      "",
      "",
      "8=) Ollie Watkins (0)\nAmong the most consistently reliable Premier League goalscorers since making his debut in the competition back in 2020, always reaching double figures but never yet cracking the 20-goal barrier. Based on the very early evidence this time around, you are going to need to crack the 20-goal barrier to be in the frame and that looks like hard work in this particular Aston Villa team.",
      "",
      "9=) Chris Wood (2)\nThe Nottingham Forest striker smashed in two goals v Brentford in his opening game of the season on the back of a fine 24/25. Does seem slightly disrespectful that his two goals in one game sees him comfortably trailing plenty of none-in-two merchants at this time.",
      "",
      "7=) Benjamin Sesko (0)\nNot since Robin van Persie in 2012/13 has a Manchester United player got their hands on the Golden Boot, and Sesko will need United’s general attacking play to be far less moribund than last year’s if he is to have any chance. Still, like Van Persie all those years ago, he is in his first season at the club so maybe that’s a good omen. Although unlike Van Persie, he didn’t score 30 Premier League goals the previous season.",
      "",
      "7=) Cole Palmer (0)\nOne of two members of Chelsea’s Club World Cup heroes to make this top 10. Much is expected of Chelsea – and Palmer – this season.",
      "",
      "5=) Joao Pedro (1)\nHas any player made a greater contribution to a club before even playing a league game? His role in Chelsea’s Club World Cup triumph after rocking up halfway through the tournament was stunning. His first Premier League goal of the season came v West Ham.",
      "",
      "5=) Alexander Isak (0)\nTwo fairly significant questions here. Where, exactly, will he be attempting to score the necessary Premier League goals to secure this prize? And how much of a headstart will he give some pretty tasty rivals before we know the answer to question one?",
      "",
      "4) Hugo Ekitike (1)\nHas made a flying start to his Liverpool career but might he just prove a bit too ‘scorer of great goals, not great goalscorer’ across an entire campaign? Also very hard to know exactly what everyone’s favourite palindromic striker’s season might look like until the Alexander Isak Situation is resolved.",
      "",
      "3) Mohamed Salah (1)\nFaded towards the end of last season but already had this award in the bag long before that. Early evidence suggests he won’t have to shoulder quite such a goalscoring burden at Liverpool this season, but also that he’ll still get/create a vast number of opportunities.",
      "",
      "2) Viktor Gyokeres (2)\nThe Proper Striker to finally deliver the title to Arsenal? Not on the evidence of that opening-day performance v Man Utd or the first half against Leeds but definitely possibly of the second half.",
      "",
      "1) Erling Haaland (2)\nLooking to reclaim his crown after last season’s ‘struggles’ and made – as he generally does – a rapid start to the season with a couple of goals on the opening day as the familiar focal point of a new-look Man City side. He was odds-on favourite after everybody had got a glimpse of Gyokeres on Sunday.",
      "Fabrizio Romano has revealed Man City have reached a ‘club-to-club agreement’ for a player sale, while Real Madrid plot a huge swap bid for Erling Haaland.",
      "Despite their 0-0 draw to kick the new season off, Stuart Pearce reckons Chelsea have enough to finish in the top two this year.",
      "Legitimately excitable responses to Alexander Isak’s statement and the fallout from it understandably dominate the headlines.",
      "Mind games? Being nice to an Arsenal interviewer? Whatever the reason, the newly minted Player of the Year reckons Mikel Arteta’s side are the favourites this year.",
      "Erling Haaland has been a Premier League player for two-and-a-half seasons but has already outscored a legion of legends.",
      "Either Pep Guardiola’s new Man City are incredibly good, or denuded Wolves are incredibly bad. It could well prove to be both."

      "20) 🆕 Morgan Rogers – Aston Villa to Tottenham\nOn Thursday, The Sun suggested that Arsenal were keen on Rogers, but Tottenham’s interest has obviously intensified since they lost out in the race for Eberechi Eze. We can’t see either club getting Rogers out of Villa before the deadline without doing something mental. Rule nothing out with Spurs, but it’s certainly a harder deal to do than the ones they have already failed to pull off.",

      "",
      "19) 🔽 Marc Guehi – Crystal Palace to Liverpool\nWhile Liverpool have signed one centre-back, the Reds are facing stronger resistance from Palace, who quite reasonably don’t want to give their captain away for a bag of balls, even if he is in the final year of his contract. That being true, it seems Liverpool would be content to sit tight until next summer, and Guehi is probably fine with that too.",
      "",
      "18) 🆕 Rodrygo – Real Madrid to Tottenham\nReports in Spain suggest Spurs have agreed a deal. Colour us sceptical. Very. F***ing. Sceptical. Rodrygo’s representatives are clearly trying to create a buzz around the Brazil star, with Liverpool, City and Spurs all said to be interested. The Liverpool links don’t pass the sniff test. Spurs are bound to do something big and probably daft before the deadline, but more likely is that they go for Savinho. Which could free up space for Rodrygo at City…",
      "",
      "17) Nicolas Jackson – Chelsea to Newcastle\nJackson has been available all summer but £80million was said to be the price, which is obviously mental for a one-in-three striker who Chelsea clearly want rid of. It does, though, make £60million sound more palatable but even that is too much for any club that hasn’t lost their mind. Desperation, though, can make you do funny things and Newcastle are said to have been in touch with Chelsea in recent days. Bayern Munich too, and Villa continue to be linked, but Newcastle feel the most likely club to offer anything more than a loan-to-buy deal.",
      "",
      "16) 🔽 Rasmus Hojlund – Manchester United to Napoli\nMilan were hopeful of finding a deal but it seems they have failed to convince Hojlund as well as United, with neither of those parties interested in a loan deal. Which might have scuppered whatever hope Napoli might have had of filling their Romelu Lukaku void with the Dane, but that hasn’t stopped them from talking it over with United on Wednesday.",
      "",
      "15) 🔼 Jorgen Strand Larsen – Wolves to Newcastle\nThis one has been bubbling under while Newcastle consider their options around Isak. Larsen is said to be one of a small number of strikers on their radar to serve as a replacement for the Swede and the Wolves hit-man is up for it. But he won’t go full or even semi-Isak by agitating for the move. And Wolves will apparently demand £60million since they know Newcastle have it to spend.",
      "",
      "14) 🆕 Angelo Stiller – Stuttgart to Manchester United\nYouTube searches for Stiller have presumably increased exponentially after it emerged on Thursday that the midfielder is on United’s list of Baleba alternatives. Of course, the Germany international would be cheaper and a more simple deal to pull off but United’s interest has not yet led to a conversation with Stuttgart so links are tentative. For now.",
      "",
      "13) 🔽 Yoane Wissa – Brentford to Newcastle\nThe good news for Newcastle: Brentford have signed a forward in Dango Ouattara. The bad news: Ouattara is viewed as Bryan Mbuemo’s replacement. Worse news: reports suggest Brentford have significantly increased their valuation of Wissa, perhaps to as much as £60million. The player did not take it well, reacting by removing all references to Brentford on his social media, seemingly forgetting he’s not a teenager who just broke up with their boyfriend. Newcastle have tried to cheer up Wissa with a second offer, worth £45million plus another £5million in add-ons, but it’s still not enough for Brentford to seriously consider. Wissa’s next move after his Instagram tantrum: explore legal options. Prepare to hear more about Article 17…",
      "",
      "12) 🔼 Alejandro Garnacho – Manchester United to Chelsea\nIt’s ‘Chelsea or nowhere’ in Garnacho’s mind and, to be honest, we’re curious to see what ‘nowhere’ looks like. United are still insisting on £50million, using Noni Madueke’s £49million plus add-ons move as the yardstick. Chelsea, though, know Madueke wasn’t acting the d*** and they realise United need rid so their stance is that £30million is more than reasonable. Romano reckons the Blues are ‘advancing in club-to-club talks’ and a ‘deal is underway’. We expect them to meet close to the middle, probably closer to Chelsea’s number.",
      "",
      "11) Gianluigi Donnarumma – PSG to Manchester City\nDonnarumma will leave PSG. Where he ends up is less certain. The Italy keeper said his goodbyes to PSG fans after Friday night’s Ligue 1 win over Angers but while City were the frontrunners in what appeared to be a one-horse race, reports suggest the European champions are asking more than the Citizens are prepared to pay. Though James Trafford’s performance against Spurs might refocus City’s minds.",
      "MORE ON DONNARUMMA: Keeper’s flaws mean Man Utd makes more sense than Man City",

      "10) Ederson – Manchester City to Galatasaray\nYou could say there are already too many No.1s at the Etihad before the interest in Donnarumma, and City appear open to selling Ederson. Galatasaray’s offer, though, must double before City consider selling the Brazilian, which may appear unlikely but new links with Royal Antwerp’s Senne Lammens – also a target for Manchester United – suggests City are expecting some movement. Ederson will not be keen to remain on City’s bench, from where he watched James Trafford’s poor tribute act against Spurs.",
      "",
      "9) 🆕 Christopher Nkunku – Chelsea to Bayern Munich\nNkunku wants to join Bayern – of course he does! – but the Bavarians have been knocked back by Chelsea when they asked for a loan deal. Talks are ongoing so it could change very quickly, especially while Chelsea are extremely motivated to get rid.",
      "",
      "8) 🔼 Manuel Akanji – Manchester City to Galatasaray\nThe City defender was left out of the defeat to Tottenham amid talk of interest from Galatasaray. Which City are likely to encourage given their desire to trim Pep Guardiola’s squad but Akanji is said to be keen to stay. Let’s see if being bombed from the matchday squad changes his tune…",
      "",
      "7) 🔼 Savinho – Manchester City to Tottenham\nSpurs reportedly offered £43million when City wanted £60million, but there seems to have been a re-think at the Etihad. With Savinho keen to play ahead of the World Cup, some at City are more open to cashing in, so a compromise could be found. Things had gone quiet while Tottenham were faffing over Eze but now that deal is dead, reports suggest Spurs are lurking with more intent. Savinho was left out of the City squad that faced Spurs on Saturday.",
      "",
      "6) 🔼 Xavi Simons – RB Leipzig to Chelsea\nSimons was in the RB Leipzig side that was splattered all over the Allianz by Bayern Munich on Friday night but the club’s sporting director Marcel Schafer says the attacker has made clear his desire to join Chelsea. The Blues just need to shift some of the forwards they no longer want first. Nkunku seems to be the one this deal hinges on.",
      "",
      "5) 🔼 Christos Tzolis – Club Brugge to Crystal Palace\nTzolis is towards the top of Palace’s list of replacements should Arsenal or Spurs stump up for Eze. The winger has been about a bit. So far, the 23-year-old has played in Greece, England, Netherlands, Germany and Belgium. The capital could be Tzolis’s next stop, but Palace will have to improve on the opening bid rejected by Club Brugge. It will cost around half of their Eze money to get the Greek.",
      "",
      "4) 🔼 Bilal El Khannouss – Leicester to Crystal Palace\nThe Foxes playmaker is being linked with Spurs, Newcastle, Leeds, and probably a few other Premier League clubs but Palace appear better placed while they look for a replacement for Eze with £60million burning a hole in their pocket. El Khannouss was left out of Leicester’s squad to face Charlton on Saturday.",
      "",
      "3) 🔼 Senne Lammens – Royal Antwerp to Manchester United\nUnited certainly need a goalkeeper and their refusal to engage over Donnaruma suggests they have something else up their sleeve. Indeed, some reports claim a deal with Antwerp is ‘almost done’ with United paying around £17million to give Andre Onana something to think about.",
      "",
      "2) 🔼 Alexander Isak – Newcastle to Liverpool\nIsak went for the nuclear option on Tuesday night with his first public statement since going on strike. Did it move the dial? Not really. Newcastle’s response did not exactly close the door on a move but it turned the screw on Liverpool somewhat and now Isak needs to hope that the Reds are prepared to break the bank for him. We anticipate another less mischief-making offer after Monday night’s clash between the two sides at St James’ Park and the nagging feeling remains this will get done.",
      "F365 SAYS: Alexander Isak should be raging at Liverpool, not Newcastle United",
      "",
      "1) 🔼 Tyler Dibling – Southampton to Everton\nPerhaps spooked by Tottenham’s interest, Everton have finally agreed a deal worth £42million which includes £6million in add-ons and a 20 per cent sell-on clause for the Saints. Can the Toffees get it done to parade him before the first Premier League game at the new gaff on Sunday?",

      "Liverpool have been backed to sign Alexander Isak “sooner rather than later”, while Newcastle United have made two ‘transfer decisions’.",
      "Before the Alexander Isak talk, Sunday’s Mailbox features hot takes on Pep Guardiola leaving Man City and Mikel Arteta being Arsenal’s new ‘weak link’.",

      "The 2025 summer transfer window is in full swing and there are a whole raft of deals agreed. This list will change roughly a trillion times over the coming weeks.",
      "If you want a full list of just Premier League transfers then this is your link.",
      "Players are ranked by size of the initial fee, with add-ons stated.",
      "",
      "1) Florian Wirtz (Bayer Leverkusen to Liverpool) – £100m rising to £116m\nLiverpool’s quiet summer of 2024 certainly isn’t being repeated 12 months down the line with another Premier League trophy in the cabinet. And while there will certainly be more to come, it’s going to take something pretty special to top this blockbuster nine-figure signing.",
      "",
      "2) Hugo Ekitike (Eintracht Frankfurt to Liverpool) – £69m rising to £79m with add-ons\nEkitike should send Newcastle his regards for insisting dream Reds target Alexander Isak is not for sale, particularly after the Magpies had their own bid for him turned down before the Premier League champions came calling.",
      "",
      "3) Benjamin Sesko (RB Leipzig to Manchester United) – £66.2m rising to £73.4m with add-ons\nThe Red Devils turned to the 22-year-old after missing out on Liam Delap and Viktor Gyokeres, as they have taken a huge risk in a Rasmus Hojlund repeat when Ollie Watkins was right there.",
      "",
      "4) Bryan Mbeumo (Brentford to Manchester United) – £65m rising to £71m with add-ons\nIt was a painfully laborious chase but they’ve got there in the end. Turns out Sir Jim Ratcliffe can be ‘held to ransom’.",
      "",
      "5) Victor Osimhen (Napoli to Galatasaray) – £64.8m\nA pretty underwhelming outcome for Osimhen following years of links with Premier League clubs, especially Chelsea. But fair dos to him for rejecting the Saudi Pro League big bucks…",
      "",
      "6) Matheus Cunha (Wolves to Manchester United) – £62.5m\nSir Jim Ratcliffe’s cost-cutting scheme threatened Man Utd’s deal for Cunha as they had a ‘request’ rejected, but they eventually ‘met the terms’.",
      "",
      "7) Luis Diaz (Liverpool to Bayern Munich) – £60.5m rising to £64.8m with add-ons\nThis transfer is bad news for Newcastle fans. Alexander Isak to Liverpool is on, folks…",
      "",
      "8) Eberechi Eze (Crystal Palace to Arsenal) – £60m rising to £67.5m with add-ons\nArsenal looked like being Eze’s destination before they teased Tottenham with some brief dithering. Once the Gunners made decisive move, it was always going to be them.",
      "",
      "9) Martin Zubimendi (Real Sociedad to Arsenal) – £60m\nLiverpool could not persuade Zubimendi to part with the mountains and food on offer in San Sebastian but when another opportunity to move to the Premier League came around a year later, the midfielder happily hopped aboard the Arsenal bandwagon.",
      "",
      "10) Mateo Retegui (Atalanta to Al Qadsiah) – £56.3m\nRetegui moves to Saudi after finishing as Serie A’s top scorer with 25 goals last season. Quite the coup.",
      "",
      "11) Viktor Gyokeres (Sporting to Arsenal) – £55m rising to £63m with add-ons\nIt is finally done. At last we can rest for five minutes.",
      "",
      "12) Joao Pedro (Brighton to Chelsea) – £55m rising to £60m with add-ons\nTwo years after joining Brighton from Watford for a club-record fee, the Seagulls have doubled their money on the Brazilian with the usual sale to Chelsea.",
      "",
      "13) Mohammed Kudus (West Ham to Tottenham) – £55m\nThis move will go down well in east London, we’re sure.",
      "",
      "14) Illia Zabarnyi (Bournemouth to Paris Saint-Germain) – £54.3m rising to £57m with add-ons\nBournemouth held firm for as long as they could but were only able to resist the European champions for so long before making their third sale of a defender for at least £40m this summer.",
      "",
      "15) Anthony Elanga (Nottingham Forest to Newcastle United) – £52m rising to £55m with add-ons\nNewcastle United have finally landed a right winger after missing out on targets in recent windows. Elanga, Anthony Gordon and Alexander Isak is a very fun front three…",
      "",
      "16) Dean Huijsen (Bournemouth to Real Madrid) – £50m\nReal Madrid matched Huijsen’s release clause just a year after he joined the Cherries for just £12.6m. The fee will be paid in three instalments by Real, with his former clubs Juventus due 10% and Malaga 5%.",
      "",
      "17) Jamie Gittens (Borussia Dortmund to Chelsea) – £48.5m rising to £52m with add-ons\nChelsea didn’t have enough forwards already.",
      "",
      "18) Noni Madueke (Chelsea to Arsenal) – £48.5m rising to £52m with add-ons\nThere was an actual petition launched against the signing of Madueke, who might well have come in handy last season when it turned out Raheem Sterling was no Bukayo Saka.",
      "",
      "19) Tijjani Reijnders (AC Milan to Manchester City) – £46.6m rising to £59.2m with add-ons\nThe last of four signings rushed through in the first transfer window to prepare for the Club World Cup, as officially Serie A’s best midfielder in 2024/25 Reijnders might be the most intriguing.",

      "All fees and figures are taken from Transfermarkt. The 20 biggest deals of the summer are here.",
      "",
      "10) Newcastle United – £126.3m\nIt’s been a slow and frustrating summer – and there’s still no sign of a new striker – but Jacob Ramsey has arrived for £39m to join Anthony Elanga and Malick Thiaw. They still need to spend a whole lot more.",
      "CHECK OUT: The F365 transfer rumour power ranking",
      "",
      "9) Sunderland – £142.59m\nNine first-team signings have come in. We’re not sure they’re finished, either.",
      "",
      "8) Real Madrid – £144.4m\nThey had already dropped £50m on Dean Huijsen and £8.5m on a few weeks of Trent Alexander-Arnold before they agreed to sign man-child Franco Mastantuono for an awful lot of money. And then came Alvaro Carreras for another £43m.",
      "",
      "7) Nottingham Forest – £151.23m\nThere was always a sense that Evangelos Marinakis was waiting to get Crystal Palace out of the way before sanctioning a heavy spend to Europa-proof Nuno’s squad. Three players have cost more than £30m apiece and Arnaud Kalimuendo wasn’t much less.",
      "",
      "6) Atletico Madrid – £151.4m\nDiego Simeone rebuilds again, with 10 permanent signings through the door, eight of whom are between the ages of 22 and 27. Alex Baena is the most expensive of the bunch.",
      "",
      "5) Manchester City – £153.21m\nThat’s the price of a Rayan Ait-Nouri from Wolves, a Rayan Cherki from Lyon, a Tijanji Reijnders from AC Milan, a Sverre Nypan from Rosenborg, and a James Trafford from Burnley, and all of them feel like bargains.",
      "",
      "4) Manchester United – £208.4m\nThe Red Devils are back near the top of this list after making Benjamin Sesko their third major summer signing after Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha. Ruben Amorim would ‘love’ two more…",
      "",
      "3) Chelsea – £246.1m\nThey were the top spenders in the summers of 2024, 2023 and 2022 and will be up there in 2025 thanks to pre-arranged moves for Estevao, Dario Essugo, Mamadou Sarr and Kendry Paez. Throw in the £30m signing of Liam Delap and the Blues were already making very expensive waves before they signed Joao Pedro for an initial £55m and Jamie Gittens and Jorrel Hato for not much less.",
      "",
      "2) Arsenal – £254.9m\nThe long-awaited and interminably drawn-out arrival of Viktor Gyokeres nudged Arsenal up towards a £200m summer but has plenty of final-piece-of-the-puzzle vibes. Then came Eberechi Eze for another £60m.",
      "",
      "1) Liverpool – £289.5m\nFlorian Wirtz has cost an initial £100m (yes, it could rise to £116m but we’re not worried about add-ons on this particular list) and now have the top two most expensive signings of the summer after confirming the arrival of Hugo Ekitike from Eintracht Frankfurt. Full-backs Jeremie Frimpong and Milos Kerkez have joined for £29.5m and £40m respectively, and we have also added the £25m on Giorgi Mamardashvili as that transfer will be counted in this summer’s accounts. Giovanni Leoni edges the champions closer to the £300m mark."

To mistreat him like this after everything he did last season is unbearable. That’s what’s most shocking.",

      "Real Madrid were reportedly tipped off about Stiller by Toni Kroos earlier this year, though they never moved for him, while Liverpool and Arsenal have also tracked his progress.",
      "United’s interest fits with their recent Bundesliga focus under Christopher Vivell, with targets emerging from Germany throughout the summer.",

      "Liverpool, Manchester City and Tottenham have all been strongly linked with Rodrygo, who is clearly not in Xabi Alonso’s plans.",
      "But they should perhaps pump the brakes after casting an eye over this truly appalling comprehensive list of honking flops who have made the move from Real Madrid to the Premier League, in order of transfer fee.",
      "",
      "19) Christian Karambeu (Middlesbrough, £2.1m)\nWe’re in absolute agreement with Karambeu, who insisted his move to Teeside from Madrid was a “big, big deal” on the back of two Champions League titles in three years for Los Blancos, to go with his World Cup and European Championship winners medals with France. Boro finished 14th in his only season before Karambeu upped sticks to Olympiacos.",
      "",
      "18) Davor Suker (Arsenal, £3.5m)\nBought as a replacement for Nicolas Anelka, who moved in the opposite direction for £22.3m, it’s fair to say Croatia’s World Cup 1998 hero wasn’t quite like-for-like, scoring just 11 goals in 39 appearances. Fortunately Arsenal also signed a certain Thierry Henry in the same summer.",
      "",
      "17) Fernando Morientes (Liverpool, £6.3m)\nHe managed just 12 goals in 61 appearances and later admitted he was the “worst version of myself” during a two-year stint as Anfield which was “killing me slowly”. Yikes.",
      "",
      "16) Jonathan Woodgate (Middlesbrough, £7m)\nAfter two injury-ravaged seasons at the Bernabeu, Woodgate returned to fitness and form at Boro before moving to Spurs in January in 2008 and immediately becoming the second-last (yes, the second last) trophy-winning hero.",
      "",
      "15) Njitap Geremi (Chelsea, £6.9m)\nArriving in the first cash-laden summer of the Romano Abramovich era, his always felt like a slightly odd signing after a decent but not world-beating season on loan from Madrid at Middlesbrough. After 19 starts in his debut season under Claudio Ranieri, Geremi was never more than a bit-part player under Jose Mourinho, though we’re sure he’s perfectly happy with a haul of two Premier Leagues, two League Cups and an FA Cup.",
      "",
      "14) Rafael van der Vaart (Tottenham, £8m)\nWe’re not sure whether Tottenham fans will be delighted or sickened by Van der Vaart claiming the Harry Redknapp side he played in with Gareth Bale and Luka Modric was “the best team I ever played in” having left Cristiano Ronaldo, Kaka, Karim Benzema, Raul and Ruud van Nistelrooy behind him at Real Madrid.",
      "That may well have been the peak ‘Spurs are fun but are never going to win anything’ period and Van der Vaart was a big reason for that, presumably swapping notes with Jamie O’Hara over their future roles as Tell It Like It Is pundits, colloquially known as ‘pr*cks’.",
      "",
      "13) Esteban Granero (QPR, £9m)\nHe joined as one of several ‘marquee signings’ among 15 in total in that mad 2012 summer which was entirely predictably QPR’s undoing as they finished bottom of the table.",
      "",
      "12) Claude Makelele (Chelsea, £16.8m)\nComfortably the best Premier League signing from Real Madrid, Makelele made 217 appearances for Chelsea, winning five major trophies including two Premier League titles and has one of the most enduring legacies of any footballer to play in England, with clubs now spending nine-figure sums to fill The Makelele Role, albeit for slightly more well-rounded players than the diminutive Frenchman.",
      "",
      "11) Michael Owen (Newcastle, £16.8m)\nThere’s a misconception that injuries stopped Owen from reaching the Premier League heights he enjoyed before moving to Real Madrid on his return to the English top flight. But he played 29 and 28 games in consecutive seasons for Newcastle and was just a bit balls, scoring 19 goals across the two.",
      "",
      "10) Danilo (Manchester City, £26.5m)\nWe would refer to Danilo as a rare misstep in the Pep Guardiola, Txiki Begiristain era in a summer in which they also signed Aymeric Laporte, Kyle Walker, Bernardo Silva and Ederson, who’ve done alright, but they somehow managed to make a £7.5m profit on the Brazilian after two years of not doing very much at all.",
      "",
      "9) Sergio Reguilon (Tottenham, £25m)\nFor a famously miserly football chief, Daniel Levy does choose to spend Spurs’ money very strangely at times. He was entirely duped by five knockout games for Reguilon on loan at Sevilla to help them to the Europa League, and five years and 73 games after joining Spurs, the full-back is now without a club having left at the end of his contract.",
      "",
      "8) Martin Odegaard (Arsenal, £30m)\nOdegaard is presumably the recent example Rodrygo is hoping to mimic with his eyes on the Premier League. The playmaker was destined for great things when he signed for Madrid as a child but needed to leave to realise his potential, and while Rodrygo’s situation is different in that he’s proved he’s good enough for Real Madrid while still at Real Madrid, he will be attracted to a major role similar to Odegaard’s at a top English side.",
      "",
      "7) Raphael Varane (Manchester United, £40m)\nWe wonder whether Manchester United signing a centre-back with far more miles in his legs than his 28 years for £40m would be seen in more negative terms had it not been for his 30-year-old pal signing for £60m a year later.",
      "",
      "6) Robinho (Manchester City, £32.5m)\nQuite the 2008 deadline day for City, with Robinho arriving along with all the Abu Dhabi cash after their takeover of the club. The Brazilian announced his delight at signing for Chelsea in his first City press conference and manager Mark Hughes later claimed he believes he didn’t recognise him and was “expecting to see Sir Alex Ferguson at the airport”.",
      "",
      "5) Mateo Kovacic (Chelsea, £40m)\nThe ultimate close-but-no-cigar footballer in many ways as he’s never really been a key cog after leaving Inter for Real Madrid in 2015, as illustrated by him having four Champions League winners medals but not playing a single minute in the three for Real Madrid and just 10 minutes for Chelsea in 2021.",
      "",
      "4) Mesut Ozil (Arsenal, £42.5m)\nHe left Arsenal with a reputation of being work-shy, but mercurial may be a better description of an absurdly talented footballer who could do astonishing things with the ball at his feet but also often went missing in games, particularly at the end of his time at the Emirates. We’re not quite sure of the definition of a ‘streets won’t forget footballer’ but Ozil was somewhere between that and world class.",
      "",
      "3) Alvaro Morata (Chelsea, £58m)\nMorata has said he “stopped enjoying football” at Chelsea and that was pretty clear to everyone watching. “I didn’t feel like doing anything, leaving home, talking to people, nothing.”",
      "",
      "2) Casemiro (Manchester United, £60m)\nThere was undoubtedly an uptick in Casemiro’s performances at the end of last season, but he had set a very low bar by his standards to hobble over and we are very amused by what looks to be a reasonably decent chance of him starting the coming season at the base of Ruben Amorim’s midfield after well over a season of desperation to be rid of him.",
      "",
      "1) Angel Di Maria (Manchester United, £59.7m)\nHe actually started very well, with three goals and six assists in his opening 10 Premier League games, and Amorim would bite your hand off for a forward with a goal contribution ever 126 minutes as Di Maria managed in his solitary season at Old Trafford.",
      "But he really didn’t get on with Louis van Gaal and his wife might be the only person in the world who hates Manchester more than Mr Di Maria.",
      "“The people are all pasty-faced, prim and proper… weird,” she said.",
      "“They’re walking down the street and you don’t know if they’re going to kill you or what. The food’s disgusting. All the girls are all dolled up to the nines, perfectly made-up and there’s me with my hair in a bun and with no make-up on.",
      "“We try to be closer when things go bad. I did not blame him for being there. I just told him, ‘Darling, I want to kill myself, it is already night at 14:00 p.m. in the afternoon.'”",
      "We’re guessing she preferred Paris like her husband, who got 92 goals and 120 assists while starring for PSG.",
      "According to reports, Tottenham Hotspur have ‘raised their offer’ for a ‘top target’ after being beaten in the race to sign Arsenal newbie Eberechi Eze.",
      "Transfer expert Fabrizio Romano has confirmed that Manchester United are closing in on their next signing as the “deal is advancing”.",
      "Liverpool have been backed to sign Alexander Isak “sooner rather than later”, while Newcastle United have made two ‘transfer decisions’.",
      "According to reports, Arsenal have ‘submitted an offer’ for a Real Madrid star, while they have ‘reached an agreement’ for their next signing.",
      "Before the Alexander Isak talk, Sunday’s Mailbox features hot takes on Pep Guardiola leaving Man City and Mikel Arteta being Arsenal’s new ‘weak link’.",
      "Manchester United are closing in on a deal for goalkeeper also linked with Manchester City, while Everton finally pony up for a winger eyed by Spurs…"

      "Game to watch: Manchester City v Tottenham\nThe fixture computer has blessed us with a top-of-the-table clash at the earliest possible moment. Unless you consider Arsenal v Aston Villa on the very opening day such a thing, in which case you’re a damn fool. Even more so if you’re going to start indulging AFC Bournemouth and their Acme shenanigans in such alphabet-based nonsense.",
      "No, the second weekend of the season is the first time such a thing can legitimately happen, when you have a whole one game’s worth of compelling evidence of how the entire season might look, as long as every other team in the league is roughly as bad as Wolves and/or Burnley.",
      "Embryonic league table whimsy aside, it’s still a fascinating game. Historically, City v Spurs is already a fixture simply not to be missed by anyone for any reason. It has delivered goals, goals, goals and a frankly absurd number of pants-pullings by silly old Spurs.",
      "Last season’s 4-0 splattering was Spurs at their Angeball best against City in the very deepest depths of their astonishing season-wrecking autumn funk, but the wildest thing about that result is that it is only very slightly an outlier.",
      "Working backwards from that game, the Etihad encounters between these two during the Pep era have finished 0-4, 3-3, 4-2, 2-3, 3-0, 2-2, 1-0, 4-1 and 2-2. And let’s not forget that ludicrous Champions League quarter-final second leg in 2019, which City actually won 4-3 on the night as Spurs went through on away goals.",
      "It has been as close to guaranteed entertainment as the Premier League can offer. We’ve run it through the supercomputer and this fixture has the highest xN (expected nonsense) stats of any in the entire Barclays universe.",
      "And yet even without the fact it’s a top-of-the-table clash with sky-high xN values, it would still be the game of the weekend anyway for actual reasons. City looked a million dollars against Wolves last weekend, while Mohammed Kudus and Richarlison looked like absolute world-beaters for Spurs against Burnley.",
      "There were hugely encouraging signs for both teams’ seasons. But the phrases ‘against Wolves’ and ‘against Burnley’ mean care must be taken. We don’t yet really know how much of what we saw last weekend was these teams being good and those teams being rubbish. We have an inkling about which victory/performance was the more reliable long-term indicator, but we don’t yet know.",
      "We should have a far clearer idea about both teams after this game, even if it is one that itself has recent history for deception.",
      "Spurs, because they are Spurs, come into this game on the back of a week where they’ve once again decided to subject their fans to another of their trademark ritual humiliations for sh*ts and giggles, while also taking the bold step of unsettling and alienating the striker who scored two brilliant goals for them on the opening weekend. There really is nobody else who does it like Spurs do.",
      "But we already have a decent clue as to how Thomas Frank might set them up for this one. The Super Cup final ended in disappointment but for 85 minutes Frank’s 3-5-1-1 really did work strikingly well and if we’re honest we suspect Spurs would cheerfully take a 2-2 draw from this one.",
      "In a way, the transfer failings of this week and the summer as a whole make Frank’s job easier for this specific game. He can’t be accused of going too defensive when he has literally no No. 10 anyway.",
      "There seems no reason not to go to City and try the triple-pivot midfield that made life so awkward for PSG in Udine, while who doesn’t want to see Kevin Danso launching long throws at John Stones’ head?",
      "For City, it’s also a bit of a free hit in its ridiculous way. A sterner test than poor denuded Wolves could provide, surely, and one where a compelling victory would lay down a significant early-season marker about just how back they might be. But also one in which failure can just be shrugged off and put down to xN.",

Eden Hazard knew it. But perhaps nobody has ever known it quite like Eberechi Eze, who kept Spurs on the hook until Arsenal’s time of need was upon them.",
      "Spurs must have known this could happen, and that it would look just awful – especially in the wake of the Morgan Gibbs-White fiasco. We do think Eze would have joined Spurs, but we do think it would only have happened once he was absolutely definitely certain Arsenal weren’t coming back.",
      "The whole ‘Oh he just wants to play in the Conference League qualifier to help Palace out before he leaves’ turned out to be the bullsh*t it always appeared to be, a convenient way to drag a transfer out even when dealing with the arch transfer-dragger-out himself in Daniel Levy.",
      "The result is Eze being an absolute hero to Arsenal fans before he’s even kicked a ball for them. It’s a lovely place to be. And it’s distinctly possible he still won’t kick a ball this weekend, but he’s still going to be the player to watch.",
      "He’ll surely at the very least be presented to the crowd before Arsenal’s opening home game of the season against Leeds, and should help ensure a buoyant atmosphere. There will be songs. There will be p*ss-taking. There will be endless shots of Eze in the stands watching on and penny-for-his-thoughtsing from the commentators.",

      "United were simply unready and unprepared for the start of the new season, still stuck with the same utter absence of reliable goalkeepers. It is staggering to us how often really big clubs do this. The window may be open until September 1, but the start of the season is in mid-August, and those games do still count.

      "Everton were passive and ponderous, allowing Leeds to set the tone and tempo of the game throughout. It nearly delivered a point – although for what it’s worth we simply cannot understand the fuss around the penalty given the way James Tarkowski moved his arm towards a ball coming at him from such a distance – but it wasn’t exactly a showing to inspire confidence for the season ahead.",
      "A new stadium is blessing and curse, with home advantage no longer quite the familiar helping hand it once was as everyone gets used to the new surroundings.

      "So that’s matchday one of the new Premier League season in the books.",
      "We can already jerk those knees and draw some pretty nailed-on conclusions based on what we saw, but how about what we didn’t see?",
      "Here, then, is a list of all those players who didn’t even make it as far as the bench on the opening weekend of the season, ranked by how p*ssed off they might be feeling about it.",
      "And no we didn’t fully understand when we started just how massive this was going to get. We are and remain idiots incapable of working out the kind of final answer a sum roughly working out at 20 x 5 might produce. But we are also blaming Sunderland for having just too many players and turning our brain into absolute mush.",
      "On which note, sorry if any injured or suspended players have slipped through the net here. Call us names in the comments by all means. But we’ve tried our best to sieve them out, as well as not including any players signed in the few days or so before the opening games for whom day-one absence is largely to be expected.",
      "",
      "97) Renato Veiga (Chelsea)\nHe’s off to Villarreal, with Chelsea somehow turning a profit and even securing a 40% sell-on clause. It’s essentially witchcraft at this point.",
      "",
      "96) Carlos Miguel (Nottingham Forest)\nThe Brazilian keeper has since returned to his homeland and signed for Palmeiras after a single year in Nottingham spent almost exclusively watching Matz Sels from the bench. Fair enough, in every way from every angle.",
      "",
      "95) Marko Stamenic (Nottingham Forest)\nMidfielder who arrived in 2024, spent a season at Olympiakos and has now left on a permanent deal to Swansea. Nothing to see here.",
      "",
      "94) Andrew Moran (Brighton)\nOn his way to play alongside Son Heung-min at LAFC. There are worse loan moves, we reckon.",
      "",
      "93) Alex Moreno (Aston Villa)\nOn his way to Girona any moment now.",
      "",

      "CHECK OUT: Every Premier League transfer and release confirmed in the summer of 2025",
      "",
      "91) John Ruddy (Newcastle)\nPossibly the peak veteran-keeper-having-a-lovely-time among the third-choicers in the Premier League now Scott Carson has finally bowed out as a hero and national treasure.",
      "",
      "90) Remi Matthews (Crystal Palace)\nMore absolutely textbook ‘veteran third-choice keeper living his best life’ areas here.",
      "",
      "89) Freddie Woodman (Liverpool)\nWe’d imagine Woodman was under no illusions about his status when joining Liverpool this summer.",
      "",
      "88) Armin Pecsi (Liverpool)\nThere’s a lot of hype around the young Hungarian keeper, but he’s clearly one for the future rather than present.",
      "",
      "87) Tom McGill (Brighton)\nThe Canadian keeper has been with Brighton since he was 14 and signed a contract extension this summer that will mean he’s spent almost half his life at Brighton if he sees it out. Has never played a first-team game for them.",
      "",
      "86) Ellery Balcombe (Brentford)\nSpells at St Mirren and Motherwell last season took his tally of loan moves to nine during his Brentford career, with every chance he hits double figures in the next week or so.",
      "",
      "85) Mark Gillespie (Newcastle)\nExtended his contract in the summer for another year, presumably in full and happy knowledge of precisely what his role would be, and that this role was not ‘first-choice goalkeeper for Champions League club’.",
      "",
      "84) Brandon Austin (Tottenham)\nDid himself no harm when called upon on occasion in the depths of Tottenham’s injury hell last season, but very much third choice behind Guglielmo Vicario and Antonin Kinsky at this time. That he was also the only fit and available first-team-adjacent player at Spurs who wasn’t named in Thomas Frank’s first Premier League matchday squad is definitely nothing to worry about.",
      "",
      "83) Vaclav Hladky (Burnley)\nMade one appearance for Burnley in the Championship. Odds-against to match that in the Premier League even without James Trafford in the way.",
      "",
      "82) Alex Paulsen (Bournemouth)\nThe Kiwi back-up keeper has been linked with a move north of the border, with St Mirren and Hibernian both interested.",

      "81) Matthew Cox (Brentford)\nFourth-choice keeper at this moment. Will either go out on loan himself, or be promoted to third-choice keeper when Ellery Balcombe gets the tenth loan of his Brentford career.",
      "",
      "80) Blondy Nna Noukou (Sunderland)\nReserve keeper who made it as far as the bench in four Championship games last season. Can’t have been too surprised to see his name missing from the first Premier League squad of the season.",
      "",
      "79) Luis Sinisterra (Bournemouth)\nAn injury-hit campaign last season has been followed by a summer of uncertainty. Left out of the Friday night trip to Liverpool as talks continued over a loan to Cruzeiro in Brazil.",
      "",
      "78) Daniel Bentley (Wolves)\nDid play a couple of Premier League games late last season, but still has Jose Sa and Sam Johnstone and thus is, we imagine, well aware of his place. Plus being as far away as possible from a 4-0 home defeat to Man City is probably quite shrewd in the long run.",
      "",
      "77) Simon Moore (Sunderland)\nMid-30s keepers signed to be back-up in the Championship very rarely move up that pecking order after promotion.",
      "",
      "76) Alex Cairns (Leeds)\nPlayed one Championship game for Leeds. In 2011/12. Returned to the club last season and surely knows exactly where he stands, which isn’t necessarily true for all spare Leeds keepers at this time.",
      "",
      "75) Gabriel Slonina (Chelsea)\nA Club World Cup winner despite not yet playing a senior game for Chelsea, but no goalkeeper on the Blues’ books can be without a chance. It is a position where Chelsea have enormous breadth but no actual depth.",
      "",
      "74) Lewis Dobbin (Aston Villa)\nOne of last season’s entirely normal and unremarkable late June transfers between clubs in PSR strife and there was absolutely nothing to see here. Has yet to play a game for Aston Villa and that’s unlikely to change this season or, very possibly, ever. Spent last season on loan at West Brom and then Norwich, and another Championship loan is surely on the cards.",
      "",
      "73) Ian Poveda (Sunderland)\nDidn’t feature in pre-season, didn’t feature in the opening-day win over West Ham, is very obviously clear to leave the club. Did contribute a pair of assists for the Under-21s in a 5-3 defeat to Tottenham on Monday night.",
      "",
      "72) Chris Mepham (Bournemouth)\nHad a brilliant season on loan at Sunderland and there was plenty of expectation that might become a more permanent arrangement. Now apparently on the radar of Wrexham who – little-known fact for you here – have famous owners.",
      "",
      "71) Romain Faivre (Bournemouth)\nLeft Lyon for the south coast in the summer of 2023 but has still spent far more time in France than England since then after loans at Lorient and Brest. Has made only five brief substitute appearances in the Premier League and doesn’t appear likely to add to those any time soon.",
      "",
      "70) Timothee Pembele (Sunderland)\nFell out of favour last season, spent time on loan with Le Havre in France, is not part of the Black Cats’ grand Premier League plans.",
      "",
      "69) Abdoullah Ba (Sunderland)\nFell out of favour last season, spent time on loan with USL Dunkerque in France, is not part of the Black Cats’ grand Premier League plans.",
      "",
      "68) Ashley Barnes (Burnley)\nJoined Burnley for a third time after signing from Norwich in January following 18 months away and declared he had ‘unfinished business’ upon signing a one-year extension to that short-term deal in the summer. Certainly brings vast top-flight experience to the Clarets, but the nagging question is how much chance he’ll get to bring that experience to bear on the actual pitch. Get the sense this is unofficially almost a player-coach role.",
      "",
      "67) Jay Matete (Sunderland)\nSpent last season on loan with Bolton in League One. Seems unlikely to now force his way into a bolstered Premier League-ready squad.",
      "",
      "66) Hannes Delcroix (Burnley)\nSpent the second half of last season on loan at Swansea and appears unlikely to add to his 12 Premier League appearances from 23/24.",
      "",
      "65) David Carmo (Nottingham Forest)\nWent out on loan to Olympiacos straight after signing for Forest last summer, and it’s important not to look at who owns Olympiacos. Appears to be available for another temporary move at least this summer.",
      "",
      "64) Joe Anderson (Sunderland)\nMade his first Sunderland start 811 days after signing during that fun and ultimately justified period late in the season when Regis Le Bris was resting all his key players for the play-offs. Unlikely to see how that translates to Premier League opportunities now.",
      "",
      "63) Etienne Green (Burnley)\nWe very much enjoy the fact the Anglo-French goalkeeper played for Saint-Etienne. And actually played, too, which hasn’t been the case since joining Burnley last summer. Presumably because his name is not Etienne Burnley.",
      "",
      "62) Emmanuel Dennis (Nottingham Forest)\nIn the last year – and realistically surely last days – of a Forest career that has just never got going after a £10m move in 2022. Less than 30 appearances later, there is zero chance he adds to that tally with Dennis likely available for free to anyone who wants him.",
      "",
      "61) Alfie Gilchrist (Chelsea)\nDoesn’t take a genius to work out that, with no permanent deal materialising, another Championship loan appears likely.",
      "",
      "60) Armando Broja (Burnley)\nShort of fitness after a disrupted pre-season, was Scott Parker’s explanation for his absence at Spurs. Fair enough, probably.",
      "",
      "59) Naouirou Ahamada (Crystal Palace)\nSpent last year on loan at Rennes, doesn’t appear to be in Oliver Glasner’s plans, and the transfer trail on this one has now gone extremely cold.",
      "",
      "58) Nathan Patterson (Everton)\nHas had a torrid time at Everton with injuries but had been involved during pre-season before being left out altogether at Leeds on Monday night.",
      "",
      "57) Sam Greenwood (Leeds)\nAttracted plenty of Championship interest early in the summer but it’s all gone a bit quiet for a player who spent last season on loan at Preston and is entering the final year of his Leeds contract.",
      "",
      "56) Josh Bowler (Nottingham Forest)\nHas had five loan moves in three years at Forest, most recently at Luton for the second half of last season, and appears to be further away from the first-team picture than ever.",
      "",
      "55) Issa Kabore (Man City)\nSpent last season out on loan at Benfica and Werder Bremen, and the right-back is powerfully unlikely to still be at City when the transfer window music stops.",
      "",
      "54) Callum Doyle (Man City)\nSet to be the latest high-profile member of the great Wrexham Circus.",
      "",
      "53) Omar Richards (Nottingham Forest)\nWas unlucky with injuries when he first signed for Forest from Bayern Munich, but any chance of making a go of things at the City Ground has now surely passed him by. Spent last season on loan with Rio Ave in Portugal, and a permanent return has been touted and seems a win all round.",
      "",
      "52) Harry Amass (Man United)\nWas even left out of the U21 side as United seek to secure a loan for a player they’ve been clear is not available for permanent transfer. There is interest from the Championship, but United appear in no rush to push Amass out the door.",
      "",
      "51) Luca Koleosho (Burnley)\nCould be heading back to his former club Espanyol on loan, according to the Burnley Express. Which is a newspaper and not James Anderson.",
      "",
      "50) Martial Godo (Fulham)\nCoventry are keen on the winger, who was a bit-part first-team player last season and appears unlikely at this stage to be any more than that for Marco Silva this time around.",
      "",
      "49) Alex Murphy (Newcastle)\nSpent the second half of last season on loan at Bolton and the start of this one back with Newcastle’s Under-21s.",
      "",
      "48) Eric da Silva Moreira (Nottingham Forest)\nBologna have been linked with the young full-back who made only two brief appearances in the Premier League last season but did make it as far as the bench for four of the first five games. But, perhaps tellingly, only once in the second half of the season.",
      "",
      "47) Alan Browne (Sunderland)\nFilled in in various positions during the promotion season, but among those seemingly now left behind by the squad’s Premier League glow-up.",
      "",
      "46) Aaron Anselmino (Chelsea)\nAccording to Matt Law, Chelsea ‘haven’t quite decided’ what they want to do with the Argentine, who they signed for £15.6m last summer, sent back to Boca Juniors on loan for the season, recalled in January, never picked, then took to the Club World Cup, where he played for two whole minutes. Our crystal ball says: season-long loan somewhere in La Liga.",
      "",
      "45) Milan Aleksic (Sunderland)\nAnother player whose chances last season came mainly towards the end of the regular Championship season when all eyes were firmly on the play-offs.",
      "",
      "44) Abdallah Sima (Brighton)\nVery much for sale, with a wonderfully varied crop of reported suitors including Norwich, Lens and Olympiacos, while Rangers – where he spent 23/24 on loan – have also been interested in another go.",
      "",
      "43) Ahmed Abdullahi (Sunderland)\nInjury wrecked his first season on Wearside and Regis Le Bris was apparently keen to at least give him a pre-season chance to show his worth. We’ll have a definitive verdict on that over the next week or so.",
      "",
      "42) Jeremy Sarmiento (Brighton)\nSeeking a permanent move away from Brighton over the next couple of weeks having spent the last two seasons as something of a Championship promotion specialist after spending time at both Ipswich and Burnley in their successful campaigns.",
      "",
      "41) Harrison Ashby (Newcastle)\nStill yet to make a competitive appearance for Newcastle since his move from West Ham, and at 23 can surely no longer rely on ‘promising youngster’ status. Make-or-break season, you feel. And a sub-optimal start.",
      "",
      "40) Nazariy Rusyn (Sunderland)\nHajduk Split opted not to trigger a permanent move after his loan last season.",
      "",
      "39) Fabio Vieira (Arsenal)\nDoes sadly now look like he will not go down as the greatest Vieira to play for the Gunners. A loan to Stuttgart has been mooted for a player further away from the first-team picture than ever after Arsenal’s extravagant summer purchases.",
      "",
      "38) Matt Targett (Newcastle)\nPlayed only 19 minutes of Premier League football last season but did at least generally make the bench when available.",
      "",
      "37) Maxwel Cornet (West Ham)\nThe most forgotten of forgotten men. Graham Potter has been very gentle but very clear. “He’s at a stage in his career where he needs to play regularly. At the moment, it’s difficult for me to guarantee that.”",
      "",
      "36) Tawanda Chirewa (Wolves)\nSpent last season on loan at Derby and Huddersfield. Something similar is likely on the cards for 25/26.",
      "",
      "35) David Datro Fofana (Chelsea)\nThe top question suggested when you Google him is ‘Who does David Datro Fofana play for?’ and that is an uncomfortably profound question.",
      "",
      "34) Nectarios Triantis (Sunderland)\nHibs have been keen to take him back after his time there on loan, while West Brom have also been strongly linked with the midfielder.",
      "",
      "33) Calvin Ramsay (Liverpool)\nLikely heading back to Scotland having failed to establish himself at Anfield. Which is no disgrace, to be fair.",
      "",
      "32) Fabio Silva (Wolves)\nNow apparently set for a move to Roma, because he is less fussy about these things than Jadon Sancho apparently.",
      "",
      "31) Igor (Brighton)\nWas expected to join Real Sociedad weeks ago. Has not yet done so. Might not do so. Either way, doesn’t appear to figure in Fabian Hurzeler’s Premier League plans.",
      "",
      "30) Isaac Schmidt (Leeds)\nA loan switch to Werder Bremen is all agreed, but Leeds want numbers in before letting the full-back leave.",
      "",
      "29) Karl Hein (Arsenal)\nHas made one Arsenal appearance in seven years – of course it was in the Carabao – and appears to be in the itchy-feet, want-to-play school of third-choice keepers rather than the can’t-believe-this-is-my-life-this-is-amazing group. Werder Bremen are apparently keen.",
      "",
      "28) Chido Obi (Man United)\nPatience is the key for a 17-year-old who made his breakthrough last season and will surely get opportunities again this time around, especially when/if Hojlund is bombed out.",
      "",
      "27) Owen Bevan (Bournemouth)\nHighly-rated Wales U21 centre-back has seen injuries hamper his progression to the first team, whether that’s at Bournemouth themselves or somewhere else on loan. If he stays fit, could yet get a chance this season given the way pretty much Bournemouth’s entire defence was picked off in the summer.",
      "",
      "26) Raheem Sterling (Chelsea)\nWe’re calling it now: deadline-day loan to Spurs after both he and they have exhausted all other options.",
      "",
      "25) Pedro Lima (Wolves)\nA loan looks like a smart idea for the right-back, who is one of approximately 7398 fringe Premier League players apparently of interest to Wrexham.",
      "",
      "24) Jamaal Lascelles (Newcastle)\nThe club activated a contract extension last season, but with Lascelles having now apparently slipped to, at best, fifth-choice centre-back it wouldn’t be a huge shock to see Newcastle’s longest-serving current player moved on over the next 10 days.",
      "",
      "23) Reiss Nelson (Arsenal)\nArsenal would like to sell him, Fulham would like to have him back. Should be simple, but the Cottagers favour another loan for an injury-prone player entering the final two years of his contract while Arsenal would prefer something more permanent. It screams loan-with-option on September 1, frankly.",
      "",
      "22) Mike Tresor (Burnley)\nRestricted to one substitute appearance in the FA Cup across the whole of last season. It’s just never quite happened for the winger at Turf Moor and having been prominently involved in pre-season was nowhere to be seen in the matchday squad at Tottenham, suggesting a departure over the next couple of weeks is surely the likely outcome here.",
      "",
      "21) Ethan Pinnock (Brentford)\nHas seen it all across six years at Brentford and you’d imagine he remains a welcome familiar sight after a summer of upheaval and flux for the Bees. Played 32 matches in Brentford’s first Premier League season, then 30, 29 and 22 in the subsequent three. No great surprise to see those numbers continue on that trend this season, but he was still on the bench for every game he was available last term.",
      "",
      "20) Christopher Nkunku (Chelsea)\nCurrently sat with his trotters up on close to 200 grand a week. You can only be so miffed about that. Chelsea’s transfer policy is not his fault, and he’s another one whose wildly generous contract terms make him extremely awkward to shift no matter how surplus to requirements he becomes.",
      "",
      "19) Axel Disasi (Chelsea)\nDoes appear among the more shiftable of the 25/26 Chelsea bomb squad. Spent the second half of last season on loan at Villa and there must surely be a Premier League suitor out there that works for all parties. Also not one of the Chelsea outcasts on the very daftest money, putting him within the wage structure of most non-crazy Premier League clubs. Most obviously and necessarily Bournemouth given the scale of their defensive losses this summer.",
      "",
      "18) Albert Sambi Lokonga (Arsenal)\nSevilla didn’t take up the option to make his loan permanent at the end of last season, so Lokonga is back in career limbo. They’re not Man United-level, but Arsenal are low-key bad at getting fringe players out the door.",
      "",
      "17) Alejandro Garnacho (Man United)\nChelsea or nothing has been Garnacho’s mantra all summer. Could actually end up being nothing. Can Chelsea get Prick Protection?",
      "",
      "16) Illan Meslier (Leeds)\nHigh-profile errors last season didn’t cost Leeds in the end, but have cost Meslier. Firmly replaced as first choice by Lucas Perri and not even on the bench against Everton. A return to France seems the likeliest outcome here.",
      "",
      "15) Jadon Sancho (Man United)\nEverything appears to be agreed with Roma for a loan-with-obligation, and we’re not quite sure what Sancho is waiting for as his ill-fated United career meanders to an acrimonious close. We should all be hacked off at this waste of an obvious talent, but not sure where exactly Sancho can reasonably now direct his own ire without asking himself uncomfortable questions.",
      "",
      "14) Konstantinos Tsimikas (Liverpool)\nNow behind Milos Kerkez as well as Andy Robertson in the left-back pecking order at Anfield, with Fulham, Leeds and Nottingham Forest all keen to offer him a more straightforward route to Premier League minutes, but he could yet be retained at Liverpool for squad depth purposes.",
      "",
      "13) Tyrell Malacia (Man United)\nPart of the bloated United Bomb Squad, but not perhaps a villain in the same way as certain other members of that cohort. Malacia’s crime, such as it is, is to be not quite good enough. He also wasn’t quite good enough for PSV, where he spent the second half of last season on loan.",
      "",
      "12) Tariq Lamptey (Brighton)\nHas made over 100 Premier League appearances for the Seagulls and signed a one-year contract extension in the summer, but could yet move on before the window closes. Everton have been sniffing around, by all accounts.",
      "",
      "11) Facundo Buonanotte (Brighton)\nLooks certain to join the Brighton exodus; the only question is where, for how long, and/or for how much. The list of clubs reportedly interested is a long and glamorous one with Spurs, Borussia Dortmund, Bayer Leverkusen, Roma and also, in fairness, Leeds, West Ham and Forest all credited with interest of some sort or other in the Argentine playmaker this summer.",
      "",
      "10) Carney Chukwuemeka (Chelsea)\nChelsea are holding out for a permanent sale, and want somewhere close to the £40m release clause in his contract. Borussia Dortmund wanted another loan move, and now Juventus are reportedly interested having allowed Douglas Luiz to join Nottingham Forest on loan.",
      "",
      "9) Emerson (West Ham)\nMarseille are keen on the left-back who played 31 Premier League games last season but has apparently fallen way down the pecking order at the London Stadium. Which really might be a blessing.",
      "",
      "8) Antony (Man United)\nDesperately wants to return to Real Betis, where he enjoyed himself so much on loan last season, and is clearly willing to wait until the very last minute if necessary to give that move every chance of coming to fruition, no matter how much United might have preferred a swifter solution.",
      "",
      "7) Oleksandr Zinchenko (Arsenal)\nFulham, Porto, Fenerbahce and Real Betis have all been linked but no solution appears imminent for the Ukrainian as he enters the final year of his Arsenal contract.",
      "",
      "6) Rasmus Hojlund (Man United)\nErik Ten Hag continues to haunt Manchester United, apparently closing off one exit route for Hojlund by selling Victor Boniface to one-time Hojlund-suitors Milan. Surely someone somewhere must want a striker who doesn’t really score goals but runs about a bit while secretly being far taller than you expect.",
      "",
      "5) Ben Chilwell (Chelsea)\nA member of last year’s bomb squad and back hanging around the training ground after Crystal Palace opted against making his loan move permanent. Genuinely quite daft from all concerned this hasn’t been sorted out more swiftly and permanently.",
      "",
      "4) Patrick Bamford (Leeds)\nHas been told he is not in Daniel Farke’s plans and is free to find a new club with just a year left on his contract. Leeds’ understandable concerns around Bamford’s injury history are nevertheless slightly dented by signing Dominic Calvert-Lewin as his direct replacement.",
      "",
      "3) Yoane Wissa (Brentford)\n‘We’ve made a decision that he’s not available after a very disrupted pre-season,’ was future-Sporcle-scupperer Keith Andrews’ statement ahead of the Nottingham Forest game. “I’ve been very clear on the situation as head coach: I want Yoane in the building.” But not, at this time, on the pitch. Has probably played his last game for the club.",
      "",
      "2) Jakub Kiwior (Arsenal)\nNo shame in being unable to shift William Saliba or Gabriel Magalhaes from the starting XI, but slipping behind Cristhian Mosquera and out of the full-strength matchday squad altogether might sharpen Kiwior’s focus on finding a new club. Although, funnily enough, also didn’t make the matchday squad on the opening day last season, before being in every single one of the remaining 37, so maybe it’s fine actually.",
      "",
      "1) Alexander Isak (Newcastle)\nWe’ve scoured the internet and can find no mention of Isak anywhere, meaning his absence from the opening-day draw with Aston Villa is a complete mystery. Perhaps some things man is not meant to know.",
      "He can be – and is – very pissed off indeed that he’s missing the start of this season, but should really be aiming almost every drop of that boiled piss in a different direction.",

      "Manchester United reportedly asked for an evolving Chelsea star in negotiations over the sale of Alejandro Garnacho to the London club.",
      "United have attempted to shift some players off the books who are surplus to requirements this summer. They got Marcus Rashford out on loan, to Barcelona, but the likes of Garnacho, Antony, Jadon Sancho and Tyrell Malacia are still at the club.",
      "Should they sell each of those players, they should make a decent sum of money, to potentially but some new talent.",
      "They have also been looking into a midfield signing since improving their attack, but the lack of available funds has hindered their pursuit of Brighton’s Carlos Baleba, while Crystal Palace don’t want to sell Adam Wharton.",
      "But United have looked for a solution which solves both of their problems. They have been negotiating with Chelsea for some time over the potential sale of Garnacho.",
      "The Red Devils want £50million, while their Premier League rivals don’t want to pay more than £30million.",
      "But to potentially bring the price down and add a midfield star to their ranks, transfer insider Ben Jacobs has suggested that United asked for Andrey Santos.",
      "He said on The United Stand: “What I can tell you is that when discussions have been ongoing for Alejandro Garnacho to Chelsea, Andrey Santos has been spoken about.",
      "“I don’t think it’s going to lead anywhere, because Chelsea don’t want to sell. That’s another player, though, that Manchester United appreciate. It’s nothing more than that at this stage.”",
      "It is unsurprising that Chelsea don’t want to lose Santos. After going out on loan to Strasbourg last season, where he scored 10 Ligue 1 goals and assisted four more, he played four times in the Club World Cup for the Blues in the summer, assisting once, and came off the bench in this season’s Premier League opener.",
      "Reports earlier in the summer suggested that West Ham had approached Chelsea over the potential £45million transfer of Santos, but were turned away as Enzo Maresca’s side see a lot of promise in the Brazilian midfielder.",
      "That will leave United sweating that they’ll have to let Garnacho go to Stamford Bridge for a cut-price fee, as Ruben Amorim doesn’t want him, needs cash, and currently Chelsea are the only side who are in for him, but won’t budge.",
      "A recent report has stated the Red Devils have given Tottenham the green light to make an approach for Garnacho, as drumming up some extra interest might mean the winger’s price rises and Chelsea don’t get an easy deal.",
      "Manchester United have reportedly given Tottenham the ‘green light’ to come back into the frame for Alejandro Garnacho, as they fear gifting Chelsea a cut-price signing.",
      "Rather than Man Utd and Chelsea meeting in the middle on Garnacho to leave them both £10m unhappy, we propose £20m-worth of ‘Pr*ck Protection’.",
      "According to reports, Chelsea are ‘working to finalise the signing’ of Manchester United star Alejandro Garnacho amid a ‘discreet offer’.",
      "Transfer expert Fabrizio Romano has revealed his clear “feeling” on Alejandro Garnacho’s situation at Manchester United amid interest from Chelsea.",
      "Chelsea have reportedly made a ‘whopping offer’ for a defender, while Fabrizio Romano has provided an update on Alejandro Garnacho and Xavi Simons.",
      "Arsenal have rejected the opportunity to sign Man Utd winger Alejandro Garnacho this summer in favour of Eberechi Eze, according to reports."

      "Manchester United's performance in their 1-1 draw with Fulham dampened optimism around the side and underlined the need for midfield reinforcements, according to Gary Neville.",
      "Emile Smith Rowe's equaliser in a dramatic game at Craven Cottage cancelled out a contentious own goal by Rodrigo Muniz as Manchester United's wait for a first Premier League win of the season continued following last weekend's 1-0 loss to Arsenal.",
      "Ruben Amorim persisted with Casemiro and Bruno Fernandes as his central pairing, with the latter missing a first-half penalty as Kobbie Mainoo remained an unused substitute.",
      "\"[My optimism] has been checked slightly because it felt like there were a couple of the old scars reappearing and opening up,\" Neville said on The Gary Neville Podcast.",
      "\"I think the goalkeeper is still looking very shaky on those crosses from corners, which can't continue because that anxiety builds, and then in central midfield I think United have to do a piece of business now.",
      "\"I would have liked to have thought that Mainoo could step up and be that person, but it's quite clear that at this moment in time Ruben Amorim is not having him.",
      "\"He starts with Casemiro and Bruno Fernandes, he then puts Mason Mount back in there and then he brings [Manuel] Ugarte on in front of him, which tells you he's fourth-choice really.",
      "\"That means that they are going to need to get something sorted because it's going to be a problem.",
      "\"The two in there do get exposed when that front three are just a little bit higher and that back five get pushed back a bit.",
      "\"Those gaps, those acres of space seem to open up, and I thought United got cut through quite a few times in the second half.",
      "\"I think Bruno Fernandes is part of that in there and he [Amorim] is going to have to sort it out.\"",
      "For the second week in a row, Neville felt Manchester United's performance worsened with Amorim's substitutions, one of which saw Benjamin Sesko thrown on early in the second half.",
      "The Slovenia international, a £73.7m signing from RB Leipzig who also appeared from the bench against Arsenal, was unable to make an impact as Manchester United struggled to find attacking momentum.",
      "\"I said this last week and it's a little bit worrying: Fulham got a lot stronger when they made their substitutions, I actually thought United got worse when they made theirs,\" said Neville.",
      "\"Sesko, at the moment, let's just say it, he's nowhere near in terms of fitness or just getting up to speed.\"",
      "Neville feels the striker will need to be given more minutes to build his fitness, starting in Wednesday's Carabao Cup second-round tie away to Grimbsy Town.",
      "\"Ruben Amorim said before the game that there is a clamour to play him,\" said Neville. \"Last week, I was saying, 'look, let's just get him straight in'.",
      "\"He is going to have to get him in against Grimsby and give him 90 minutes.",
      "\"He's going to have to probably play him against Burnley next Saturday, just to get him going, because you can see he needs football.",
      "\"What you can't do is let a player of that value, that potential, just keep being on the bench.",
      "\"The problem he'll have is that he wants to keep [building] the team, but I think what you saw when they brought Sesko on, put Mount into midfield and took Casemiro off, they did get opened up and it looked like Fulham could score.\"",
      "Neville felt Fernandes allowed his penalty to distract him during the game.",
      "\"I think he let it impact him,\" said Neville. \"I thought he let it get to him. When he came out for the second half, he was still talking to the referee.",
      "\"I know that can happen, but I think you can see in his face sometimes with Bruno that he wears his heart on his sleeve and it was quite clear that obviously he's desperately disappointed about missing the penalty in the way in which he did.",
      "\"Sometimes, if a goalkeeper saves it you might think, 'OK, that happened', but he's smashed it over the bar, and then there was this idea that the referee disrupted his rhythm.",
      "\"It was a complete accident. Obviously the referee was trying to walk back towards the players coming in.",

      "Sunday 24 August 2025 20:58, UK",
      "Calvin Bassey and Marco Silva both felt Manchester United's opener at Fulham should have been ruled out for a clear push by Leny Yoro in the build-up - on an afternoon of officiating controversy at Craven Cottage.",
      "In the pulsating 1-1 draw at Craven Cottage, Yoro appeared to have two hands in the back of Fulham defender Bassey as he met a United corner, before forcing a Rodrigo Muniz own goal. VAR Darren England approved the goal after a brief check.",
      "But Bassey felt referee Chris Kavanagh \"will be disappointed\" when they look back at the decision - especially as the Fulham defender was penalised for a shove on Mason Mount in the first half which gave United a penalty - that Bruno Fernandes missed.",
      "\"But come on, it's a foul. When you've got to jump, any little touch can put you off. He [Yoro] has got two hands [on my back]. How much worse do you need? On another day, it goes in our favour.",
      "\"It's enough for me not to win the ball and it's an advantage for him, so it should have been given.\"",
      "\"I cannot understand it. I would love to explain everything to you from the first whistle to the last. But I don't have this. It's not my job, I don't want to go in this direction for everything that went on this afternoon at Craven Cottage.\"",
      "Analysing the United goal on co-commentary duty, Gary Neville said: \"If I was Fulham, I would be asking about the two hands in Bassey's back.",
      "\"Both hands on the back and Yoro is lucky to get away with that, but he will not care.\"",
      "Bassey was also at the centre of VAR controversy as he was accused by the officials of bringing down Mount in the penalty area.",
      "As per PGMOL guidance, referees will award more penalties for holding this season - in an attempt to crack down on grappling at set-pieces.",
      "Referee Kavanagh did not award the shove on Mount in real time but - two minutes after the incident, the official was sent to the VAR monitor during the next available break in play.",
      "\"I still think it's harsh,\" said Bassey about the incident. \"I understand why it's given. I'm trying to stay strong because I know the block's coming, and then I've pulled him over my foot.",
      "\"But the ref has got to protect us as well. I'm strong, so it looks a bit more aggressive. If it's someone stronger [than Mount], I don't think it looks as bad.",
      "\"It's hard. Sometimes, when you feel the contact early, you go down and the ref can give you a foul. When you're in the game and the ball's there to be won, sometimes you're trying to get to the ball as quickly as possible and you've got to get the man out the way.",
      "\"There's a fine line between giving a foul away and getting away with it. On another day, maybe the ref doesn't look at it. We as players just have to try to be clever.",
      "\"I tried to communicate with the ref because I knew the block was coming. I told him, on every corner, 'watch the blocks, watch the blocks', but he made his decision. It's something to learn, just be a bit more streetwise and smart with it.\"",
      "Asked if he was relieved at Fernandes then missing the penalty, Bassey replied: \"I'd say it was justice! I didn't think it was a pen. It was a bit of relief.\"",
      "There was even controversy as Fernandes stepped up to take the spot-kick, with the United captain colliding with referee Kavanagh in the build-up.",
      "Analysing the incident on co-commentary duty, Neville said: \"He picked the ball up, and maybe the referee has given him a bump by accident. And he goes back, it unnerved him a little bit.",
      "\"I thought it was because the referee was adjusting the players on the edge of the box, but [a few seconds later] he was still having a go at the referee, Fernandes - as he feels it was a little bit clumsy. That is maybe what put him off.\"",
      "\"It upset me because the referee didn't apologise. That is what triggered me in that moment but that's not the excuse for missing the penalty.",
      "\"I had a very bad hit on the ball. I put my foot too under the ball and that's why it ended up going over the bar.\"",
      "Asked for his take on the incident, United boss Ruben Amorim said: \"I think he's not used to missing a penalty. He knows that every moment in this context can have a huge impact on the team.",
      "\"I felt that during the game he was not so happy, not so involved, because he had so much responsibility and he felt the missed penalty was huge for us.\"",

      "\"I hope he has got more of them to come,\" said David Moyes afterwards, acknowledging that Grealish gives this Everton something different. \"The big thing is he ball-carried for us. He retained the ball for us as well which gave us a little bit more composure.\"",
      "It is no great surprise that Grealish showed good technique. The only question was how he would approach this challenge after the disappointment of finding himself surplus to requirements at City. But he showed that he had the stomach for the fight too.",
      "He was tracking back inside two minutes. Putting in a tackle inside his own box just after the hour. \"He was game for it, didn't try to shirk anything, didn't want off after 60 minutes, didn't want any of that,\" said Moyes. \"No chance, he wants to show that he's the real deal.",

After a debut goal against Brentford and an assist against Palace, he became the first Nottingham Forest player to score or assist in both of his first two Premier League games for the club since 1998.",
      "Elanga's attributes were clear and Ndoye perhaps doesn't possess the blistering speed that Newcastle's summer signing has.",
      "However, Ndoye's adaptability will impress Nuno, who can continue to hope for an interchanging and dynamic forward line.",
      "Ndoye's first-half display saw him marshalled out of the game. However, all it took was a tweak from Nuno to switch him and Callum Hudson-Odoi and Ndoye's individual brilliance did the rest to carve out the assist that earned Forest a point.",

      "Whether it's the demotion to the Conference League or Palace's biggest stars being linked and in Eberechi Eze's case, securing a move away, the Eagles have navigated a strong start to the season. Their four games unbeaten are reflective of the mentality Glasner has developed in SE25.",
      "A win in the Community Shield saw Palace fight back to take Premier League Champions Liverpool to penalties. Their opening league fixture at Chelsea saw them controversially denied a point at the home of the world champions.",

      "\"But come on, it's a foul. When you've got to jump, any little touch can put you off. He's got two hands [on my back]. How much worse do you need? On another day, it goes in our favour.",
      "\"It's enough for me not to win the ball and it's an advantage for him, so it should have been given.",
      "On the penalty award for his foul on Mason Mount: \"I still think it's harsh. I understand why it's given. I'm trying to stay strong because I know the block's coming, and then I've pulled him over my foot.",
      "\"But the ref has got to protect us as well. I'm strong, so it looks a bit more aggressive. If it's someone stronger [than Mount], I don't think it looks as bad.\"",
      "On Bruno Fernandes' penalty miss: \"I'd say it was justice! I didn't think it was a pen. It was a bit of relief.\"",
      "\"I think we can do better but we are putting the effort, so that is the most important thing for me. I think we did well in some moments, especially at the beginning of the game.",
      "\"After the goal, we were just thinking about the result. This team needs to win games, so we need to focus on the performance and what we need to do, because if we focus on the results, we forget to do the normal things.",
      "\"We were OK until the goal. We scored and we should do the opposite: have more possession, push the opponent more. We were not smart in that moment.\"",
      "Fulham head coach Marco Silva on whether Man Utd's goal should have been disallowed:",
      "\"Perhaps. Difficult to say something. I think you saw the same as myself. All of the world saw what happened here this afternoon in terms of the VAR decisions. I will not say anything more.",
      "\"I don't have the words to explain things that are impossible to explain. They did unbelievably well when they saw the penalty. The foul on Rodrigo (Muniz) was half of a second after the push from Calvin (Bassey). I think they were amazing and we have to congratulate them.\"",
      "\"We are going to score goals because we are creating so many chances.\"",
      "Ruben Amorim is convinced Manchester United's attack will fire this season. The evidence suggests it will. They threatened to run riot in the opening 15 minutes at Fulham, but a concern is how they've faded in games.",
      "Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo, Mason Mount and Bruno Fernandes were purring early on at Craven Cottage. Cunha went close three times. The quartet linked up with speed and precision around the box. They looked sharp.",
      "But it didn't last once Fulham settled and stifled Casemiro and Fernandes with their midfield diamond. Ruben Amorim's substitutions also weren't able to have the same impact as Fulham's, Emile Smith Rowe equalising with his first touch.",
      "Benjamin Sesko came off the bench early in the second half but had just one touch in the opposition box - it wasn't a telling one.",
      "Last weekend, United's possession was in the spotlight, racking up 60 per cent against a traditional top-four side for the first time in almost a decade. It helped them get the ball into dangerous areas and fire off 22 shots.",
      "This time it was different, over 10 per cent less as they were out-passed by Fulham, not by much, but with only 10 shots to show from it. Amorim's side remain a work in progess.",
      "Marco Silva deserves a lot of credit for how his Fulham side have battled to start the Premier League season.",
      "Two games with two late goals to rescue a point on both occasions, they could have easily walked away empty-handed.",
      "Silva has been vocal about the need for reinforcements within his squad, with Benjamin Lecomte their only addition throughout the summer, and spoke openly about it after full-time against Manchester United, too.",
      "\"We need to sign two or three players,\" he said in his post-match press conference.",
      "Returns for Antonee Robinson and Ryan Sessegnon, as well as a boost in confidence for Emile Smith Rowe following his goal, will ease the strain on his squad. However, if they want to start converting draws into wins, fresh faces will be needed.",
      "They had the momentum to win this fixture but just lacked the final push in the latter stages of the game.",
      "Super 6 are starting the season by guaranteeing a £1,000,000 winner! Play for free."

      "With Manchester United, there is hardly ever a middle ground but instead an ever expanding extremes of a scale",
      "Let me explain.",
      "Last season, United had a clear problem with their goalscoring and build-up play - that was simply highlighted by their 44 goals scored in the Premier League, only three teams scored fewer.",
      "So what did United do in this window? They spent around £200m on addressing that problem with the signings of Benjamin Sesko, Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo.",
      "After a positive first performance of the season in their defeat to Arsenal - much of the conversation has now been centred around the opposite end of the pitch with the goalkeeping department the latest area to be under focus after what seemed to be a mistake by Altay Bayindir against Mikel Arteta's side.",
      "Ruben Amorim admitted in his first news conference of the season that he learned a lot last season. This included realising just how much he needs to protect his side from the amount of noise around the club on a weekly basis.",
      "\"For me, the only way to protect myself and my players it to tell them not to see anything.",
      "\"You have to be like a monk, especially when you have problems and then I try to present the facts because sometimes there is a narrative that is not true.",
      "\"Altay made one mistake, but last year he had very good performances, so I try to tell that to the players and then try to battle that narrative.",
      "\"But in the end, it's with the players, they have to enjoy their life, go to work, enjoy their family and try not to see anything on the TV or on the internet.\"",
      "Many of the players have highlighted that they feel the vibe and bond around the team has been different.",
      "Yes, there is some hesitancy to believe that after previous managers and false dawns, but there does seem to be genuine optimism after the re-opening of their training ground, new and exciting players joining the club and a positive first performance against Arsenal.",
      "Amorim said: \"Last year, sometimes I was worried going to the games, but now I'm excited, it is completely different.\"",
      "\"We suffered together so much (last season) and that can bond people - the spirit is really good.\"",
      "\"When you feel the team is playing well, you get confident and you feel more free to play and if you feel more free to play, you are happier.",
      "\"If you are happier, your day-to-day is better and it's like a snowball.\"",
      "Amorim's attacking options have been bolstered with Premier League tried and tested Mbeumo and Cunha - both who can play as No 10s or as the main striker to share the load alongside the young Sesko.",
      "The threat they showed against Arsenal, whether it was Cunha's mazy runs or Mbeumo's movements in behind, left fans at Old Trafford with a renewed sense of optimism and Amorim feels the same.",
      "\"We have different options this year, but sometimes football is more than just on the pitch,\" Amorim said.",
      "\"They [Mbeumo and Cunha] are coming in at a moment where the spirit is different, the place is different - sometimes we have a lot of very good players but the scars were there and that influenced the dynamic of the team.",
      "\"They can help us, not just on the pitch but off the pitch too, I feel the guys are more free because they were not here in the very, very difficult moments - they are seeing a different thing.\"",
      "A big component of whether Amorim's United will truly be a \"different thing\" this season could be the young Slovenian Sesko - who Amorim had called 'football obsessed'.",
      "He had already spoken about the potential of Sesko, 22, but I wondered - how exciting can it be for Amorim himself to work and develop a young player like the Slovenian?",
      "Amorim explained: \"When you are in a club like this, you want to have the best players but you also have to imagine the future.",
      "\"That is so exciting - I like to know the players, I like to see the videos of the players and to try to get all the information, but you want that confirmation and I felt Sesko was even better than what I was thinking.",
      "\"I have to be careful, Sesko is going to be our striker for many, many years so we need to put that in his head and let him settle down, to stay calm and enjoy his day because he's really like you said, obsessed.",
      "\"I'm really happy - not just with him but with Cunha, Diego (Leon), and Mbeumo - we know that we have the players and we know that in our future we are going to have that base and that is really important for us.\"",
      "We are only one game into the season, but if United can replicate their performance against Arsenal most weeks, especially without the distraction of European football, it could present a promising opportunity for United to improve on last season's 15th-place finish.",
      "However, United need to earn that optimism from those outside the gates of Carrington and, as Amorim said previously, it is only up to them to fight and change their own narrative.",
      "They will only do that by showing up on the journey rather than focusing on the destination.",
      "\"Success is to win titles, and we don't know if we are going to achieve that (this season),\" Amorim said.",
      "\"We are not in the moment that we can say we are clearly fighting for the league - we just need to get the small steps and the small steps is to prepare every game like it's a final.",
      "\"We want to be really competitive, trying to dominate games, trying to score goals and not get our fans bored to see our games… so if we have the small things and we put check, check, check - in the end, it's going to be better.",
      "\"I think everyone knows that we have a goal - not for this season but in three years to win the Premier League title.",
      "\"We are going to do these steps to reach that goal, but in this club, you know that every week the narrative is going to be different so we need to be prepared for that, block the noise, do the job and try to win games.\""
