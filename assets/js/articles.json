      "Manchester United are still reeling from their defeat to Everton on Monday night. Ruben Amorim’s side saw their five-game unbeaten streak end after failing to find a way to score against 10-man Everton at Old Trafford.",
      "An early red card for Idrissa Gueye after a clash with his team-mate Michael Keane did not help United’s cause. Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall still put the away side in front before the break and David Moyes’ team held on to claim a memorable three points.",
      "United’s lack of European football means Amorim has several days to mull over where his team went wrong. In terms of their hopes of returning to European competition, United currently sit 10th in the table but are still just three points off a Champions League spot.",
      "Ruben Amorim has hit back at claims that he refuses to change his tactics. The United boss has routinely been criticised throughout his tenure for sticking with his preferred back-three formation, with some pundits and sections of supporters arguing that his squad are not best suited to the system.",
      "Earlier this season, Amorim claimed that not even the Pope could get him to change his system. However, the United boss has now admitted that he is willing to tweak his tactics and make in-game changes, referencing the fluid attack he adopted at Sporting CP which often saw Viktor Gyokeres operate out wide.",
      "\"We did it against Liverpool, it wasn't with Bryan Mbeumo, it was with Cunha,\" Amorim explained to DAZN Portugal. And it's an option that we have, and nowadays, everyone, I think not only in the English league but in the Portuguese league, in all leagues, there's a great variation in how things are structured.",
      "\"We might say it’s a 4-4-2, but five minutes later it’s a 4-3-3 or a 3-4-3. And therefore I'm willing to do anything, contrary to what many people think that I'm too fixated on one thing. I simply start with a basic foundation, but obviously, we can use it in the future.\"",
      "Manchester United are set to decide whether to send a trio of young prospects out on loan in the January transfer window. The Daily Mail reports that defender Ayden Heaven will be one of those under consideration as the 19-year-old has struggled for regular minutes this term and faces increased competition from a returning Lisandro Martinez.",
      "Summer signing Diego Leon could be another to seal a temporary move away from Old Trafford. The 18-year-old full-back has featured in matchday squads but is yet to make his first team debut and has been linked with a loan move to Nice.",
      "Sekou Kone is another highly-rated star who has been tipped for a loan move in January. The 19-year-old midfielder has not been involved with the first team so far this season.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Bayer Leverkusen chief Simon Rolfes has revealed that making the fastest sacking in Bundesliga history by parting ways with Erik ten Hag was best for both parties. The club's Managing Director for Sport said it was his job to be decisive when he saw the partnership was not heading in the right direction.",
      "Ten Hag replaced Xabi Alonso at Leverkusen in the summer but was afforded just three games in the dugout. The Dutch coach saw a comfortable win over fourth-tier side SG Sonnenhof Grossaspach in his first match, before giving up leads against Hoffenheim and 10-man Werder Bremen to take a single point in the league.",
      "The German side now sit third in the Bundesliga after 11 matches, and defeated Manchester City in the Champions League last time out, under the tutelage of Kasper Hjulmand. Goals from Alejandro Grimaldo and Patrik Schick put City to the sword as Pep Guardiola was left to consider his mistakes.",
      "Rolfe spoke ahead of that game at the Etihad and was plain in his reasoning over the decision. \"At the end of the day it is about the connection with the people,\" he said.",
      "\"And we had the feeling it wasn't working out or heading on a good direction. So that's why it is better to stop, for both sides, and thats why we made the change.",
      "\"If you're not convinced, then this is my role as a leader. Then I have to take decisions - I only think about what's best for results.\"",
      "The dismissal saw Ten hag given the boot for the second time in less than 12 months. The former Ajax boss was sacked by Manchester United last season. The Dutch coach criticised Leverkusen following his exit.",
      "\"The decision by Bayer Leverkusen this morning to put me on a leave of absence came as a complete surprise. To part ways with a manager after just two league matches is unprecedented,\" said Ten Hag.",
      "\"This summer, many key players who were part of past successes left the squad. Building a new, cohesive team is a careful process that requires both time and trust.",
      "\"A new coach deserves the space to implement his vision, set the standards, shape the squad and leave his mark on the style of play.",
      "\"I started this job with full conviction and energy, but unfortunately, the management was not willing to grant me the time and trust I needed, which I deeply regret. I feel this was never a relationship based on mutual trust.",
      "\"Throughout my career, every season I have been able to see through to the end as a coach has brought success. Clubs that placed their trust in me have been rewarded with success and silverware.\"",
      "Ten Hag has already rejected another opportunity after turning down the chance to return for a second spell as Ajax manager. The Dutch giants sacked Johnny Heitinga earlier this season after a disastrous run of just two wins in 11 games.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Manchester United are considering letting three youngsters head out on loan once the January transfer window opens. United’s lack of European football this season and their early exit from the Carabao Cup has left Ruben Amorim with few opportunities to rotate and give fringe players minutes – and that could prompt action in the New Year.",
      "The team are generally only in action once per week, which means Amorim has been able to keep a level of consistency in his selections. While this did appear to be bearing fruit in a five-game unbeaten run in the Premier League before the 1-0 defeat by Everton on Monday, it has had some knock-on effects.",
      "United have a history of giving opportunities to academy graduates, but they have been thin on the ground this season. The situation is shown by Kobbie Mainoo’s struggles for game time, with the 20-year-old midfielder getting just 260 minutes across nine appearances so far this season, with his only start coming in the shambolic defeat by Grimsby in the Carabao Cup.",
      "Top young stars like Harry Amass and Radek Vitek left on loan to Sheffield Wednesday and Bristol City respectively and there are further plans in the works. The Daily Mail reports that Diego Leon, Sekou Kone and Ayden Heaven could be sent out on loan in January in order to get more game time.",
      "Leon joined United in a deal worth a potential £7million from Paraguayan side Cerro Porteno in the summer. But the 18-year-old left-back is yet to make his United first-team debut, with Luke Shaw and Patrick Dorgu among those ahead of him in the pecking order.",
      "He arrived with high hopes of breaking into Amorim’s plans, but has only made it onto the bench on four occasions this season. Having initially been reluctant to consider a loan move, Leon is frustrated by only playing for the under-21s and French side Nice – who are also owned by Ineos – could represent a good fit for him.",
      "Kone, a 19-year-old midfielder, joined United in the summer of 2024 and has been playing for the under-21s. He suffered a concussion in a National League Cup tie at Tamworth, which saw him taken to hospital last month, but has since returned to action.",
      "Heaven is highly rated by Amorim but has managed just 92 minutes of action this season. The centre-back was an unused substitute against Everton on Monday and faces further competition for places through the imminent return of Lisandro Martinez.",
      "The three youngsters’ exits are being weighed up, but those of Mainoo and Joshua Zirkzee are less likely to be sanctioned. Both players are unhappy with their lack of regular minutes for United, but Amorim has made the club’s position clear ahead of the Africa Cup of Nations starting next month, when United will lose Bryan Mbeumo, Amad Diallo and Noussair Mazraoui.",
      "\"I was a football player,\" he said on Monday. \"I understand everything, and I want to help my players in every situation. I understand the frustration of some players, seeing the World Cup is there. I know what it means.",
      "\"But the first thing is that the club comes first. If I can help the club and the players, I will be happy. If not, I have to think about the team.\"",

      "Former Manchester United ace Timothy Fosu-Mensah is reportedly on the radar of Sheffield Wednesday. The 27-year-old has been without a club since parting ways with Bayer Leverkusen in the summer of 2024, with current Real Madrid boss Xabi Alonso believed to have played a part in his early contract termination.",
      "Fosu-Mensah made the switch to the German outfit in a £1.8million move during the January transfer window of 2021 after spending five years at Old Trafford. Despite suffering serious knee and hamstring injuries that limited him to just 30 appearances over three-and-a-half years, he was part of their historic Bundesliga title triumph.",
      "Even though he hasn't played competitively since April 2023, the Star suggests that Sheffield Wednesday are considering bringing Fosu-Mensah on board. The Championship's bottom club is staring down the barrel of relegation to League One following a 12-point deduction.",
      "However, the Owls seem determined to stave off dropping into England's third tier next season, as evidenced by their interest in a player of Fosu-Mensah's calibre. Among those impressing at Hillsborough this season is United loanee Harry Amass, despite Sheffield Wednesday managing just a single win.",
      "Fosu-Mensah was given his first taste of senior team action at United by Louis van Gaal on the same day Marcus Rashford made his debut. He went on to make 30 first-team appearances, with 11 of those coming under the stewardship of Jose Mourinho.",
      "The right-back has been singing praises for the Portuguese manager, revealing that he played a significant role in his development.",
      "Speaking to The Sun in February 2024, he said: \"I spent the full season with the first team and, as a result, completed a full pre-season with them for the first time.",
      "\"I was still a teenager when Jose Mourinho arrived, and he helped me mature into becoming a man in footballing terms.",
      "\"Jose was tough on young players with his demands, but in a good way, because he wanted you to be ready to represent a club the size of Manchester United.\"",
      "However, despite Mourinho's guidance, Fosu-Mensah found it difficult to secure a regular spot at Old Trafford and decided to leave for more playing time.",
      "Fosu-Mensah explained: \"It was my decision. The manager was good to me but at the end, I was not playing a lot. When you are 22, 23, or 24 years old you need to be playing.",
      "\"I didn't play much and I wanted to. It was the best decision in the end to go somewhere else where I would get more minutes.\"",
      "Sadly, he only managed to clock up just 1,050 minutes for Leverkusen, but the former United academy star is clear about his goals for the future.",
      "In an interview with World Football Index last year, he stated: \"I have had a few spells out with injury so I want to stay injury free in order to play and perform at the highest level.",
      "\"Of course, I want to win more trophies in my career but the most important thing is to be able to enjoy my football and play at the highest level of the game.\"",

      "Manchester United chiefs accept that Ruben Amorim's squad is still limited despite allowing him to spend more than £200million on new players in the summer.",
      "The Portuguese boss, off the back of the club's worst ever Premier League showing, bought in Benjamin Sesko for £74m as well as Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo for a combined fee of over £120m. Senne Lammens also came in and has made the No 1 shirt his own.",
      "Despite the quality now available to him those at Old Trafford are tempering their expectations, acknowledging that Amorim can only do so much with the team he has. A number of positions still need to be strengthened before the head coach can be expected to produce regularly.",
      "United saw their momentum halted on Monday when they were beaten by Everton, ending a run of five games without defeat. They sit tenth after 12 games this term.",
      "The January transfer window opens in just over five weeks but, despite the need to bolster certain positions, ESPN reports that United are looking to bypass the mid-season window and instead do their business next summer.",
      "That said they remain open minded and will act if it is in their best interests. Injuries to key personnel may alter their stance but finding quality players for good value can often be a challenge midway through the season, when clubs tend to hike their prices.",
      "United believe their financial position will allow them to continue to invest in the squad, despite their notable outlay in the summer. They believe a number of top earners, the likes of Marcus Rashford and Jadon Sancho, will depart in the next sixth months, which will give them more freedom financially. A return to Europe would also aid their cause.",
      "Adding a central midfielder is among their priorities, likely in the summer. Several proven Premier League performers are already on their shortlist - the likes of Elliot Anderson, Adam Wharton and Carlos Baleba. They have also assessed Wolves duo Joao Gomes and Andre.",
      "The club also believe that Amorim needs more depth at wing-back - especially given their importance in his system. Early enquiries have been made about the availability of a number of targets with United largely using conventional full-backs in those positions.",

United saw their five-match unbeaten run come to an end on Monday when Everton ran out 1-0 winners; however, the Old Trafford chief has already rejected suggestions that he is \"fixated\" on his tactics.",
      "The 10-man Toffees dispatched the hosts with ease despite playing over an hour with a man disadvantage. The defeat meant that United missed the opportunity to move into the top four and stake their claim to qualify for the Champions League.",
      "Criticism of Amorim has returned after they failed to make the extra man count, as well as capitalising on the joy they had throughout the exchanges against David Moyes ' side. The Portuguese tactician has faced scrutiny for persisting with his system, despite enduring difficult periods in his 12 months at Old Trafford.",
      "Mourinho returned to Portugal earlier this year when he was installed as the new Benfica manager. The Portuguese managerial icon spoke about the current era of managers failing to diversify from their system when the going gets tough.",

      "During their run, they beat fierce rivals Liverpool to further assert that they are not pushovers, after previously finding the Anfield club difficult customers prior to his arrival from Sporting CP.",
      "United have proved that they can mix it with their Premier League rivals, but often struggled against lesser teams. Amorim was under immense scrutiny going into this season after failing to heed the slump last season, when he succeeded Erik ten Hag.",
      "High-profile former footballers have taken aim at Amorim throughout his tenure in the Premier League over his failure to resist changing his system, including club icons Gary Neville and Wayne Rooney.",
      "Amorim has already had to defend his decisions and tactics to United legends criticising him and rejected claims again that he is unwilling to change in light of the defeat to Everton, saying: \"We did it against Liverpool, it wasn't with Bryan Mbeumo, it was with Cunha. And it's an option that we have, and nowadays, everyone, I think not only in the English league but in the Portuguese league, in all leagues, there's a great variation in how things are structured.",

      "\"I simply start with a basic foundation, but obviously, we can use it in the future. And we've already thought about that with Bryan [playing central] because he's very strong in transitions.",
      "\"I do think it's the best position for him [out wide] because he likes to be hidden, he doesn't like people watching him. He can attack, be more dangerous on one of the flanks, either the right or the left, rather than as a striker, but it's a good option, therefore I'll be able to use it in the future as I did several times at Sporting.\"",
      "Amorim's comments will no doubt please Mourinho, who clearly feels that the best managers need to adapt when the going gets tough.",

      "Gomes currently wears No.8 for Wolves. But that number is taken at United by club captain Bruno Fernandes.",
      "United do have the No.14 shirt available, which has been vacant since Christian Eriksen departed the club as a free agent this summer. Additionally, the numbers 17, 20 and 21 are also up for grabs at United, during January's transfer window, should they decide to make a move for Gomes.",
      "Upon taking the reins at Wolves, Edwards was quizzed about the swirling rumours regarding Gomes' future and a potential move to Old Trafford. \"We've spoken about stuff but my focus has been on getting the team organised,\" Edwards said last week ahead of his managerial debut for Wolves.",
      "\"We have got some good players, and there will always be interest, but I'm not aware of anything. Joao has been excellent this week.\"",
      "Gomes isn't the only midfielder whose name has been thrown into the hat for a possible United switch in recent months. The Brazilian international joins Brighton's Carlos Baleba, Nottingham Forest's Elliot Anderson and Crystal Palace's Adam Wharton on the list of potential targets for United.",

      "But United are hoping to delay their stars' exits, and Ruben Amorim wants them at his disposal to face Bournemouth on December 15. The Red Devils have lost the clash 3-0 in each of the last two seasons.",
      "Under AFCON rules, players must be released two weeks prior to their opening match. Morocco play in the first game of the tournament when they face Comoros as hosts on December 21.",
      "Ivory Coast and Cameroon play the first games on December 24. That would mean Amad and Mbeumo should depart no later than following the Wolves game on December 8.",

      "\"It is not just in our hands. We will try to arrange something with the federations.\"",

      "Former Arsenal striker Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang stole the headlines after scoring twice and drawing comparisons to Didier Drogba in Marseille's 2-1 victory over Newcastle in the Champions League.",
      "Marseille hosted the Magpies at the Stade Velodrome on Tuesday evening and endured a difficult start as Harvey Barnes gave the visitors a 1-0 lead inside six minutes. But Aubameyang struck twice in quick succession after the break to secure a 2-1 win and earned widespread acclaim from the French media.",
      "Ex-Manchester United forward Mason Greenwood also played a key role in the Ligue 1 side's second-half fightback, and Le Parisien observed that he \"brilliantly found\" Aubameyang in the first 45 minutes, though the team couldn't convert that dominance into goals.",
      "Get Football France awarded the ex-United player a 5/10 rating, but Aubameyang earned 7/10 for his display. Le Figaro highlighted that Greenwood provided some \"perfect crosses\" but suggested the 24-year-old still needs time before becoming the club's main attraction.",
      "Veteran forward Aubameyang, however, drew parallels with former Chelsea legend Drogba, with Le Parisien declaring he \"stole the show.\"",
      "In their match analysis, the French publication said: \"He and Drogba have followed different paths, but share a common thread: they both knew how to ignite the Vélodrome.",
      "\"They are those great African strikers who carry the city, who instinctively understand what this jersey represents, this raw fervor, this simple and magnificent injunction: to go towards the goal, always.",
      "\"Like Drogba in his day, Aubameyang is now one of the providers. In a cauldron of a stadium, he scored more than just a brace: he perpetuated the tradition, he honoured the motto, he held Marseille close to his heart. Straight to the point. Always.\"",
      "French publication Le Figaro were similarly effusive in their praise of the former Arsenal striker, as they added: \"More than 20 years after the OM-Newcastle match in 2004, people in Marseille are still talking about Didier Drogba's exploits in that game.",
      "\"That might not be the case for Aubameyang. But his performance on Tuesday was still invaluable.\"",
      "Marseille weren't the only side to triumph over English opposition on Tuesday evening, with Bundesliga leaders Bayer Leverkusen claiming a memorable 2-0 victory against Manchester City at the Etihad Stadium.",

      "Guardiola is under contract at the Etihad until 2027 and will complete a decade's service before the start of next season. The Spaniard has said he has no plans to stand down - and could continue in his role until 2035. But club bosses know the Spaniard will call time on his incredible spell in charge at some stage.",
      "And former City defender Danny Mills reckons the impact of him leaving will be similar to when Fergie left United.",
      "\"It’s going to be very difficult to replace Pep Guardiola at Manchester City,\" Mills told BetWright. \"He’s brought such a unique style of play and coaching, which has been embedded in the club for almost a decade.",
      "\"The owners will have to consider whether they want to maintain that style, or move to a 'win at all costs' mentality, and totally rebrand. Up until a few seasons ago, I would've suggested Mikel Arteta as a potential replacement for Pep, but that obviously won't happen now given what he’s achieved and built at Arsenal.",
      "\"A lot depends on when Guardiola leaves the club, and who is available to replace him. \"I don't think the managerial role will be in high demand - it could be considered as a lose-lose situation for whoever succeeds Pep.",
      "\"When David Moyes replaced Sir Alex Ferguson, he was never going to replicate the success of the past, but the expectation was there.",

      "Chelsea sent shockwaves through Europe on Tuesday night, as they demolished Catalan giants Barcelona 3-0 at Stamford Bridge. The task of welcoming Barca in the Champions League was always going to be daunting, given the calibre of their team.",
      "This was evident early on when Ferran Torres had a clear shot at goal but astonishingly missed, leaving the crowd in disbelief. Chelsea seized the moment, scoring off a smart corner routine which resulted in a Jules Kounde own-goal, just before Barcelona were reduced to 10-men due to Ronald Araujo receiving his second yellow card before half-time.",
      "Enzo Maresca's side kept up the pressure, with Estevao's superb solo effort doubling their lead after the break. It was further capitalised on when Pedro Neto found room behind the Barca defence, setting up Liam Delap for an easy goal.",
      "Three goals, three points and a resounding message to the rest of Europe that Chelsea mean business summed up a triumphant night for the Blues. Among the standout performers was Estevao, whose dazzling footwork and skills echoed those of many legendary players at Stamford Bridge, thrilling the fans.",
      "Following another stellar performance, the young Brazilian has received heaps of praise, including a comparison from Thierry Henry. Speaking on CBS Sports, the former Arsenal player said of Estevao: \"You wouldn't like to play against him.",
      "\"I'm not saying that you wouldn't be able to stop him, but he's coming at you all the time. He's reminding me of, I know it's early doors, but that's why I think Ryan Giggs was one of the best because he was coming at you for all the game.",
      "\"Whether he's having a good game or not a good game, he's trying to test you all the time and see if you're going to stop him or not. That's how it is as a winger.\"",
      "It's significant praise for the teenager, who's adapted well to the Premier League and Champions League. The 18-year-old officially arrived from Palmeiras during the summer in a transfer worth £29million, which may well prove exceptional value if he maintains his current trajectory.",
      "In only 17 appearances, Estevao has netted five times and provided one assist, while being carefully integrated into the squad by Maresca. Should he achieve anything approaching Giggs' illustrious career, it would represent an outstanding success - the Welsh legend featured in over 900 matches for Manchester United, recording 168 goals and 270 assists.",
      "When questioned after the match about managing Estevao's minutes, and whether it becomes more challenging to limit his game-time given such performances, Maresca replied: \"No, to be honest. Because, for when he doesn't play, Pedro Neto plays wide in his position.",
      "\"And Pedro is good. And we're happy with Pedro. We try just to defend the game plan, we use 11 players. Tonight, we decided, probably in the most difficult game of the season, we decided to play with Estevao.",
      "\"So I'm not a manager that I don't allow players to play minutes. It's just the game-plan. The game-plan always decides the first XI. It's the reason why we changed so much.",
      "\"And you say that we are unpredictable. But it's the game-plan. The game-plan defines the first 11. Now, the next one is Arsenal. The game-plan is not always good, sometimes it's also wrong.",
      "\"It defines the first XI. And Estevao, when the game plan is for him, he's going to play. And for sure he's going to play many games because he's very good.\"",

      "However, due to his age, he hasn't yet had the chance to play on the hallowed turf of the Theatre of Dreams. This could all change come December, when Darren Fletcher's Under-18s squad face off against Peterborough United in the third round of the FA Youth Cup.",
      "Last season, the team were denied the opportunity to play at Old Trafford in the fifth round of the competition, with Sir Jim Ratcliffe and Ineos looking to cut costs across the board, according to the Daily Mail. Instead, the match was held at Leigh Sports Village.",
      "Rooney is currently nearing the end of his recovery from an injury that has kept him out of action for most of the season. He managed just two appearances this term before suffering the setback in September.",
      "In recent months, he has hinted at a successful recovery and has even returned to training on grass. However, it remains to be seen whether he will be fully fit in time for next month's clash.",
      "Unfortunately, his father, Wayne, may not be able to watch him make his debut at the Stretford End. It has recently emerged that Manchester United and England legend is unable to attend his son's football matches due to his own fame.",
      "During her time on ITV's I'm A Celebrity...Get Me Out Of Here! last year, Wayne's wife, Coleen, revealed: \"That's the thing with kids I think, it's hard to go on days out. Kai told Wayne to stop coming to football games, when he played grassroots tournaments and stuff because he used to get swarmed and he couldn't even watch the game.",
      "\"How do you say to all of these kids, 'Go away, I'm watching my son?' Adults, it's different you could speak to them, so he [Kai] just said, 'Oh, dad there's no point you coming because you don't even watch me play anyway.'",
      "\"Which is sad, but it can't be helped anyway. At the same time, the fans help you along the way and get you where you are.\"",
      "Despite not being able to watch his son compete in person, Wayne has shared that he still plays a significant role in his son's development by offering advice at home. Speaking on The Wayne Rooney Show last month, the 40-year-old explained: \"I'm quite lucky where I live as I've got a little pitch there and when the kids say, 'We're coming on the pitch', all they're gonna do is tie the balls on the top corner.",
      "\"So when I say to them when I was younger, I remember setting a little square to practice passing into it and just playing off the wall. So I'm very similar, [I tell them] 'You need to work on your speed, you need to work on your technique and control.' Otherwise, you go out and you're just like, 'Watch me hit the ball in the top corner.'\".",
      "Speaking about his son's development, he added: \"He's just playing, he's a 15-year-old boy playing his football, enjoying it. Of course he gets different attention to a lot of his team-mates but I think he handles that really well.\"",

      "Hansi Flick has explained why Marcus Rashford started on the subs bench for Barcelona's Champions League showdown against Chelsea on Tuesday - pointing to Ferran Torres' recent goal-scoring form as a key factor. Rashford had been side-lined through illness for their La Liga triumph over Athletic Club last weekend - which influenced the manager's thinking.",
      "Despite Rashford's absence, Barca cruised to an impressive victory at the Camp Nou - their first at the iconic stadium in several years - netting four goals while keeping their opponents at bay. Torres netted twice in that match, prompting Flick to hand him a starting berth for the European fixture at Stamford Bridge.",
      "Speaking to Mundo Deportivo, Flick explained: \"Ferran scored two goals on Saturday - and Marcus had been out for three or four days due to his injury. But he's ready to play at any moment.\"",
      "The Barcelona boss proved true to his word at the break, introducing Rashford in place of Torres - who had squandered a golden chance in the opening period - before matters soon deteriorated for the visitors. An unfortunate Jules Kounde own goal and Ronald Araujo's dismissal left Barcelona trailing and down to 10 men at half-time.",
      "Rashford found it difficult to make an impact as Chelsea extended their advantage through a spectacular Estevao Willian effort and a composed Liam Delap finish.",
      "The 28-year-old is unlikely to face harsh criticism for his display in west London, given the difficult circumstances, with Flick remaining a staunch admirer of Rashford - something he made abundantly clear when questioned about his integration into the squad earlier this week.",
      "He said: \"I'm really very happy [he is back]. We will decide tomorrow [Tuesday] if he plays from the beginning or if he comes in from the bench. But, as I said, I'm happy to have him in our team.",
      "\"Last time when we played Newcastle, I also said this. I've followed him, I think, his whole career... I was impressed about him, with his quality, what he is doing in the box, what he is doing in front of goal.",
      "\"He has also showed it with Barcelona, which is really good. But for him, this change to live in another culture. The people in Barcelona are fantastic, we have nice weather. For me, it's amazing.",
      "\"You can see now he is also smiling a lot, and if he can enjoy the atmosphere we have, it is also good for him.\"",
      "The decision to make his transfer permanent from United is unlikely to rest with Flick, but 13 goal contributions so far this campaign suggests he's doing everything possible to ensure the £26million buy-option included in his loan deal gets triggered.",
      "Ruben Amorim could desperately use Rashford right now following his side's failure to find the net against 10-man Everton on Monday night.",
      "Matheus Cunha and Benjamin Sesko were side-lined through injury for that defeat, with the latter facing several weeks out of action. Bryan Mbeumo will also be unavailable over the New Year period as he represents Cameroon at the Africa Cup of Nations.",

      "He remained with the Blues after Potter's sacking in a chief analyst role under Mauricio Pochettino and Enzo Maresca. Macaulay left Chelsea to join West Ham alongside Potter in January 2025 but departed in October, shortly after Potter was given his marching orders.",
      "United had been looking to add a key figure to assist on transfers since July, reports The Athletic, and considered a number of candidates before landing on Macaulay. Among those they looked at was Ben Chorley, the former sporting director of Valenciennes in France and current head of UK scouting at Southampton.",
      "Recruitment has long been considered an issue for the Manchester side, but it was generally accepted that they had one of their best windows back in the summer. They invested heavily but bought in players who had proven themselves in England - Bryan Mbeumo among them.",
      "The jury is still out on the £74million they spent on Benjamin Sesko, but Ruben Amorim remains confident the young Slovenian will come good. Senne Lammens was signed as an unknown quantity but the Belgian has established himself as the new United No 1 after some impressive showings.",

      "Alejandro Garnacho was seen giving Jamie Gittens a boost as they strolled down the tunnel of Turf Moor on Saturday. Gittens was included in Enzo Maresca's starting line-up for Chelsea's match against Burnley, replacing the Argentinian forward.",
      "However, instead of throwing a tantrum, the 21-year-old displayed his maturity with a friendly gesture as they headed back onto the pitch after half-time. Garnacho was leading the way when Gittens seemed to call out to him, playfully gesturing towards his eyes as if to say he was keeping an eye on him.",
      "Garnacho responded with a grin and a gesture of his own as they moved out of sight of the television cameras. Even though he didn't get a chance to play from the bench, Garnacho made a beeline for the away end at Turf Moor following Chelsea's 2-0 victory to show his gratitude to the fans who had travelled all the way from London.",
      "Garnacho appears to be hitting his stride on the pitch whilst building solid connections with his new teammates off it. Since his £40million switch from Manchester United this summer, Garnacho has notched two goals and provided two assists across 10 appearances in all competitions.",
      "Meanwhile, Maresca was also quick to heap praise on the youngster earlier this month. He said of Garnacho: \"He arrived here from another club where he was not training 100 per cent so his physical condition was not good.",
      "\"Slowly, slowly, now it's better. He's doing very well on the ball but he's doing very, very well off the ball. He knows that to play with us he has to be good on the ball and off the ball otherwise he's not going to play. We are very happy with him at this moment.\"",
      "It's a completely different scenario to how Garnacho was getting on with United earlier this campaign. After being frozen out under Ruben Amorim, Garnacho slammed the club's dismal 15th-place Premier League finish.",
      "He was also frustrated at losing the Europa League final to an equally-struggling Tottenham at the time. He said in May: \"It's difficult for all of us. This season has been s***. We lost the final, we didn't beat anyone in PL. It's very difficult.\"",
      "Manchester United could have done with a bit of Garnacho's magic on Monday night, as they found it tough to break down a 10-man Everton at Old Trafford. Despite having an extra man after Idrissa Gueye was sent off for slapping Michael Keane just 13 minutes in, the Reds couldn't find a way past David Moyes' resurgent side.",
      "The match was stolen by Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall, who netted the decisive goal 29 minutes in, before a Jordan Pickford masterclass denied United of any hopes of levelling. The Red Devils are also feeling the pinch of mid-season injuries, having to rely on Joshua Zirkzee for the full match due to Matheus Cunha and Benjamin Sesko being out injured.",
      "Zirkzee has found it hard to adjust to the Premier League's physicality since his move from Bologna last summer, managing only three goals in England's top tier last season. It'll be intriguing to see how Amorim copes in the coming weeks, especially with Sesko expected to be side-lined until December.",
      "There's no word yet on when Cunha will be back in action, following a knock he picked up in training last week. United's next challenge is Crystal Palace at Selhurst Park on Sunday, 30 November.",

      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe has been completely unequivocal and unapologetic about the need for change at Manchester United since taking over in February 2024. The petrochemicals billionaire's pursuit of his one true goal has upset many over the past 20 months – including ex-players and club legends.",
      "It has been over a year since Ratcliffe decided to take Sir Alex Ferguson’s lucrative role as club ambassador away from him. Ferguson is just a drop in the ocean, set in the context of more than 450 staff redundancies, but the legendary ex-manager was a big step in terms of perception.",
      "It showed that Ratcliffe and his Ineos operation were not worried about negative PR. He is dead set on making savings wherever they can be found – and the most recent financial results showed the direction of travel in that respect, with record financial revenue of £666.5million, record commercial revenue of £333.3m and record matchday revenue of £160.3m.",
      "Ineos have employed consultants to make recommendations, and while they likely led to redundancies, the moving of London office eight years early and reduction of staff benefits and freebies, they are unlikely to have had anything to do with the chipping away of relationships with the club’s past.",
      "It is something ex-manager David Moyes hinted at ahead of Everton’s 1-0 win at Old Trafford on Monday. “The history of Manchester United was not that [one of change],” he said.",
      "“Manchester United had a great culture. They stuck with their managers, they brought through their own academy boys. They actually had some of the best characteristics of what you would want your club to have; good values.”",
      "While Moyes was addressing issues on the pitch, there is an obvious parallel happening off it, where the culture has undoubtedly changed. Much has been made of the improvements to the club’s Carrington training ground, but there have also been hints at United moving away from its roots in another sense.",
      "Club legend Norman Whiteside decided not to renew his season ticket in May after a series of issues, including the relocation of his seat, while Ferguson had to step in last year to ensure the family of Sir Matt Busby kept their seats.",
      "The price of tickets has increased and modern club legends Paul Scholes and Nicky Butt are struggling to get hold of them. Scholes revealed on Monday that he had turned to a tout to get tickets, while Butt said he had been threatened with losing his season ticket after missing a few games.",
      "“It's a very different football club to the club we knew,” Scholes said. “I don't know about you Nicky, you worked there quite recently, but I don't really know anybody there.” Butt replied: “I don't know anybody there.”",
      "Taken separately these incidents perhaps don’t add up to much, but seen together they paint a picture of the club Ineos are trying to create: a modern, efficient, money-making one. A connection to the club’s extremely successful past doesn’t fit into that picture.",
      "It seems that manager Ruben Amorim might have a sense of this becoming an issue. He reportedly wants to bring back legends like Eric Cantona in order to maintain a connection to the past and to share experiences. But with United sitting 10th in the Premier League after they failed to score past 10-man Everton for 81 minutes, he undoubtedly has bigger priorities for now.",
      "Amorim is far from certain to get his way and, as the manager of a struggling team, he could be discarded soon anyway. Ratcliffe and Ineos have shown they are 100 per cent focused on the future and have disregarded the importance of the past.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

Scholes is one of United’s greatest ever players, but he claims that so much has changed at the club since he retired that he wouldn’t know who to contact to source legitimate tickets.",
      "The midfielder made 718 appearances for United after coming through the academy. He helped the club win 25 major trophies, including 11 Premier League titles during an era of dominance under Sir Alex Ferguson, but he feels disconnected from the current era.",
      "Scholes discussed the situation with his former United team-mate Nicky Butt on The Good, the Bad & the Football podcast. Butt was also a part of the famous Class of 92 group of players, which also included the Neville brothers, Ryan Giggs and David Beckham, and has similar feelings and experiences.",
      "“It's a very different football club to the club we knew,” Scholes said. “I don't know about you Nicky, you worked there quite recently, but I don't really know anybody there.”",
      "Butt replied: “I don't know anybody there.” Scholes then said: “If I wanted a ticket, I wouldn’t know who to phone. I’ve been asked for a couple of tickets but didn’t know where to go.",
      "“I have four season tickets so we use them, my son uses them every single week. But you get people asking (for tickets). I've had a Salford lad who wants to go to the game this week, a couple of tickets. So I've had to ring a tout. Am I allowed to say that? Honestly, I know a tout. I just don’t know anybody at the club!”",
      "Butt then relayed a story in which he claims United threatened to take a season ticket away from him because it hadn’t been used frequently enough. “My lad has got the same thing, and if you don't use them three times you get them taken off you,” he said.",
      "“I've had an email saying ‘you're having your ticket taken off you’. So I rang them up and said ‘can I speak to somebody about this please?’ And it’s just a switchboard, so they might not be a football fan, and they go ‘who am I speaking to please?’, and I go ‘Nicky Butt’ and they go, ‘OK, well who's that?’ I didn’t say it but I feel like saying ‘I played like 450 games for this club and I won about seven titles’ but it is a different world. I wouldn’t know where to go.”",
      "“I'm not complaining about that,” he said. “That's just the way it is and the way it happens. Just because you played for the club, you're not entitled to stuff.”",
      "An exasperated Paddy McGuinness responded: “Hang on a minute! The amount of games you played, your life long service as a player for United, you gave everything to the club.”",
      "Scholes replied: “Yeah but we only played for them. You're going back 13 years now for the last time I played. We don't mind paying for them, we just don't know who to ring because the club is just different, it's a different football club.”",

      "Manchester United legend Paul Scholes and Nicky Butt have lifted the lid on a secret meeting where they were asked to weigh in on potential signings for the club. The former midfield maestros revealed the consultation took place while Ryan Giggs was serving as caretaker boss during the 2013/14 campaign following the departure of David Moyes.",
      "The Red Devils were in the midst of a major overhaul following Sir Alex Ferguson's retirement, with the club pursuing high-profile acquisitions in an effort to reclaim their position among the Premier League's elite. Against this backdrop, then-executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward turned to Scholes and Butt for their input, presenting the duo with a shortlist of four potential recruits.",
      "During an appearance on The Good, The Bad and The Football podcast, the United stalwarts detailed how that discussion with Woodward ultimately paved the way for Paul Pogba's homecoming. Butt recalled: \"I just remember Ryan [Giggs] took control of the club for four or five or six games at the end of the season...",
      "\"Then me and Scholesy did it [the meeting] with him and Phil as well. And I remember obviously they were looking for the right manager to come in and take the job, so they obviously needed targets to go and get in the summer.",
      "\"So I had left the training ground and got called back, and there was a meeting with myself, Scholesy, Ryan, and Ed Woodward, and I think Ed Woodward was on a Zoom call; it wasn't so much face-to-face, I think he was in London, and it was like, 'Who would you get?'",
      "\"And he gave us a list of midfielders, I know Pogba was one, Kroos weren't you saying? Fabregas might've been one.\"",
      "Scholes added: \"I think [Cesc] Fabregas might've been one as well, I think even [Luka] Modric might've been one as well.\"",
      "Butt continued: \"I remember we were all discussing pros and cons to them all, and the end of the conversation was, 'go for both of them, [Toni] Kroos and Pogba, because we're Man United and we need to get back to the top'.",
      "\"And if you get one, it's like yin and yang, we mentioned it a while ago, about if you get centre-backs, with Harry Maguire, and you need a footballing player next to him, it's a bit of the same with midfielders.",
      "\"We're not all the same, and you need a bit to complement each other, and that was how it was left, and then they went all-out for Pogba.\"",
      "United brought Pogba back to Old Trafford in August 2016, sealing a transfer from Juventus that could have totalled £93million with all the additional clauses. The France international featured 233 times for the Red Devils during his second spell, netting 39 goals and providing 51 assists.",
      "He then left on a free transfer in 2022. Pogba's career is often viewed through different lenses, with some recalling the magic he could weave, while others feel he never consistently lived up to his hefty price tag.",
      "The inclusion of Toni Kroos, Luka Modric, or Cesc Fabregas in the team might have altered his fate, with the first two continuing to shine at Real Madrid for many more years, while the latter had a stint back in England with Chelsea, before playing in France and then Italy.",

      "Ruben Amorim has rejected the idea that he is \"fixated\" with his tactics at Manchester United, while confirming that he is \"willing\" to tweak the team's approach to win games. Amorim has steadfastly stood by his 3-4-3 formation since his appointment from Sporting Lisbon, saying that not even the Pope could persuade him to change United's tactical system.",
      "The formation has been contentious, but Amorim was named Premier League manager of the month in October after overseeing wins against Sunderland, Liverpool and Brighton, which silenced speculation about his future. United have started November with two draws and a defeat to Everton, who claimed three points at Old Trafford, despite playing for 77 minutes with just 10 men due to a sending off.",
      "Amorim was accused of being stubborn against Everton, but he has insisted he is adaptable. DAZN Portugal has launched a new Q&A segment on YouTube, where fans have the opportunity to ask questions to the \"biggest Portuguese figures in world football\", and Amorim was the first guest.",
      "Amorim was asked whether he would return to he \"mobile attacking style\" he implemented at Sporting, where there was no fixed striker and the front line would constantly rotate. Although Viktor Gyokeres was the first choice striker during Amorim's time at Sporting, the shape was built around rotations, with Gyokeres asked to drift wide, link play and drop deep.",
      "The 40-year-old said United have already played with a fluid attack this season and, interestingly, said that he was \"willing\" to try new tactics, despite critics thinking he is \"fixated.\"",
      "Amorim said: \"We did it against Liverpool, it wasn't with Bryan Mbeumo, it was with Cunha. And it's an option that we have, and nowadays, everyone, I think not only in the English league but in the Portuguese league, in all leagues, there's a great variation in how things are structured.",
      "\"We might say it’s a 4-4-2, but five minutes later it’s a 4-3-3 or a 3-4-3. And therefore I'm willing to do anything, contrary to what many people think that I'm too fixated on one thing.",
      "\"I simply start with a basic foundation, but obviously, we can use it in the future. And we've already thought about that with Bryan [playing central] because he's very strong in transitions.",
      "\"I do think it's the best position for him [out wide] because he likes to be hidden, he doesn't like people watching him. He can attack, be more dangerous on one of the flanks, either the right or the left, rather than as a striker, but it's a good option, therefore I'll be able to use it in the future as I did several times at Sporting.\"",
      "Amorim has regularly insisted his system is not a problem. Speaking earlier this year, he said: \"The problem of our team is not the system. We have a lot of problems, we are trying to work on these problems, of course every system needs different characteristics. But I was always really clear. I have one idea.",
      "\"I am still really confident because I have an idea how to play football. I will not change that, no matter what. And I’m not talking about the system, it’s the way I see football, I will not change that.\"",

      "Although Manchester United have tended to struggle without Casemiro on the pitch this season, Ruben Amorim was happy to hook him before the hour mark against Everton on Monday. Casemiro started poorly and didn't make a single tackle during his 58-minute appearance.",
      "He looked like a 33-year-old, and the display was a reminder of why he shouldn't be given a contract extension. The fact that there has even been a conversation about whether Casemiro merits an extension (his current deal expires in June) is a credit to himself, but it would be a mistake to keep him beyond this season.",
      "It's been great to see Casemiro make such a strong start to the campaign, but there were always doubts about how long he could sustain that level. After all, he has entered the winter of his career so it seemed unlikely he would be able to perform like that for the entire season.",
      "Casemiro's performance against Everton was the kind of display expected from someone of his age. He looked pedestrian and struggled with Everton's physicality before the red card. There are bound to be more performances like that from Casemiro before the end of the campaign. And of course, there should be some more strong displays produced as well, but the point is that United need someone in that position who can deliver every week. They need someone younger.",
      "Casemiro will celebrate his 34th birthday in February, and he is the highest earner in the dressing room, so United would make an Ed Woodward-esque decision by extending his deal. Those who have argued for Casemiro's contract to be extended have said he should be kept on reduced terms and given a back-up role, but this is a player who has won five Champions League trophies.",
      "It seems unlikely Casemiro would accept a huge pay cut to sit on the bench in Manchester when the option of playing in his homeland - and still starting each game - could be on the table. Regardless, the option should be taken out of his hands. United need to move on and sign a replacement.",
      "There was another contract lesson to be taken from the performance against Everton because Harry Maguire's absence was felt at the back. Thierno Barry won 14 aerial duels, the most by a player in a Premier League game this season, which wouldn't have happened with Maguire on the pitch.",
      "Leny Yoro is an exciting prospect for the future, but he lacked aggression in several instances against Everton, and Maguire would have been the better choice had he been available.",
      "Everton are a physical side and dominated aerial duels. United are guaranteed to be dragged into battles like that on a few occasions across a season, and Maguire is indispensable in those scenarios.",
      "Maguire is out of contract at the end of the season, but it's logical for United to try to extend his stay at Old Trafford, provided he is happy to take a slight pay cut to continue at the club.",
      "The England international does not earn as much as Casemiro, which should make it easier for a compromise to be reached between both parties, while his role in the squad wouldn't change much.",
      "Set-pieces have become important again in the Premier League over the last two seasons and losing Maguire, who is more often than not imperious in the air, would be a huge blow.",
      "Amorim recently said about Maguire's future: \"We are really happy with Harry. It is not the time to talk about that again because that gives the idea that we are thinking so far away. We are really happy with Harry. He is a really important for us, but we need to focus on the next game.\"",
      "The United boss was asked whether he was pleased with Maguire's renaissance and said: \"Yes. I think it was good for him to play with the three centre-backs. I think he feels more comfortable.",
      "\"He doesn't need to go to the side so much. Sometimes, you help some players with the way you play. Sometimes, it is the opposite with some players. I am really pleased. I think he is not young, but he can learn a lot. He can improve. I think he can be so much better with the ball because he has that quality.",
      "\"He needs to show that. Nowadays, with the set-pieces that you see, the amount of men that you put in the box, every cross from the opponent, everyone is playing the pass.\"",
      "Maguire's stock rose without him playing against Everton, while Casemiro's didn't do himself any favours.",

      "Season ticket holder Graham Barton has complained to United about the length of the queues in the past, but he believed Monday's delay was the worst he has encountered.",
      "\"That has slowed it down a little bit, but the problem is, I'm W11, you have four turnstiles, and there are barriers dividing you up as you queue up. And you've got six stewards searching, and they're usually quite slow. That makes a massive queue, and by the time the queue gets to the wall, the chief steward tells them to search quicker, so the searches aren't adequate anyway, and there's a massive queue.\"",
      "Barton continued: \"It's a safety risk because you don't need anything to get to that point. When I got there, it was the longest the queue had ever been, it went right back to the wall. It was about 20ft along the wall. I took the photos when I got there and spoke to one of the top stewards about it.",
      "\"I didn't like his attitude. He said it wasn't a problem, and I said I'm not comfortable standing in the queue. Think of the Manchester bombing. What if someone wanted to blow someone up here? There were hundreds of people. Then he said it's the turnstiles being slow, not the search time.",
      "\"I have complained about the length of the queues before to the stewards, also when the club sent one of the surveys to season ticket holders, I put down that queuing was an issue.\"",
      "The MEN contacted United for a response to supporter concerns about turnstile delays. A Manchester United spokesperson said: \"We understand the frustration of fans caught in queues close to kick-off and we are constantly looking for ways to improve flows, including deploying additional stewarding staff to help deal with any issues causing hold-ups at turnstiles.",
      "\"However, in general, digital ticketing has been working well and there were no systemic problems reported last night. The best way to avoid queues is to arrive at the stadium in plenty of time before kick-off, although we do appreciate that this can be more difficult for midweek games, and that many fans were affected by traffic congestion around the ground last night.\"",
      "United were also criticised by fans who encountered problems at the turnstiles before the season's opening fixture against Arsenal. The club rolled out a new ticketing system for every supporter for 2025/26, meaning fans now enter Old Trafford using NFC technology.",
      "All tickets are digital on a smartphone and downloaded to a device's wallet. The tickets are scanned to gain entry at the turnstiles, but mass confusion occurred before the Arsenal game when hundreds of supporters could not gain entry, and they were sent to the ticketing office by unprepared stewards.",
      "The MEN were told some stewards on the turnstiles sent fans to the ticketing office because they did not know the solution to the problem, forcing fans to miss the start of the game.",
      "One fan described the Arsenal delays as a \"disgrace\" while another supporter revealed their 77-year-old mother, a platinum season ticket holder, missed the game due to the changes.",

      "Manchester United are set to appoint Kyle Macaulay as their new head of senior scouting, following a four-month search to recruit an employee for the position as part of the club's transfer strategy overhaul. Macaulay will oversee the senior scouts and report back to Christopher Vivell, who joined United on a temporary basis last year and was appointed permanently as the director of recruitment in February.",
      "Vivell oversees the club's recruitment network and reports to the director of football, Jason Wilcox. Vivell and Macaulay worked together at Chelsea between 2022 and 2023, with the former serving as technical director at Stamford Bridge and the latter worked as head of scouting.",
      "In the summer, club sources said the search for a new head of senior scouting was part of the ongoing restructuring and modernisation of the scouting network at Old Trafford. Vivell has streamlined the scouting network but has retained 'significant human scouting and analytical capabilities', particularly focused on emerging talent, with data support.",
      "Macaulay was available to move to Manchester after leaving West Ham in October. He has followed Graham Potter throughout his career, previously working at Swedish club Ostersunds, Swansea City and Brighton, before following Potter to Chelsea and, more recently, West Ham. He spent six years as Ostersunds’ chief analyst, where he first worked with Potter.",
      "Macaulay worked as chief scout for Swansea and served as Brighton's head of scouting during a period in which the Seagulls used their data model to sign Moises Caicedo, Kaoru Mitoma, Marc Cucurella and Leandro Trossard. Since Ineos invested in the club, there has been increased activity in markets outside of Europe.",
      "Sekou Kone was signed from Mali in 2024, Diego Leon arrived from Paraguay this summer and United have struck a preliminary agreement to sign Colombian teenager Cristian Orozco. Sir Jim Ratcliffe has invested in United's data department, notably hiring Michael Sansoni as director of data in the summer. Sansoni was previously the senior performance engineer at the Mercedes F1 team, and he contributed to eight World Championship-winning seasons.",
      "The University of Southampton graduate joined United two months before the official announcement of his appointment, allowing him to be involved in transfers over the summer.",

      "Hello and welcome to live coverage of all the latest Manchester United transfer news.",
      "Here, we will be covering all of the latest transfer news, rumours and gossip relating to United, as and when it comes in.",
      "The Reds suffered a narrow 1-0 loss to a ten-man Everton on Monday to bring an end to a five-game Premier League unbeaten streak. However, Ruben Amorim will hope to bounce back to winning ways when United take to Selhurst Park to face Crystal Palace this weekend.",
      "At the time of writing, United sit tenth in the Premier League standings, but could break their way into the top four after their clash with the Eagles, dependent on results elsewhere - something that will come as a major boost as they look to secure European football for 2026/27.",
      "However, Amorim will be well aware that he is set to temporarily lose a number of key players when the Africa Cup of Nations rolls around next month, with Bryan Mbeumo, Noussair Mazraoui and Amad all heading to the tournament to represent their respective countries. As a result, Sir Jim Ratcliffe may be called upon for assistance in the January transfer window.",
      "Roma right-back Zeki Celik, Real Madrid stalwart Vinicius Jr and Wolves midfield maestro Joao Gomes are among the latest names to be linked with a move to Old Trafford when the window reopens, as United look to strengthen their team across the board.",
      "On the flipside, Casemiro's contract is set to expire next summer, Marcus Rashford is still out on a season-long loan with Barcelona - who hold an option to make the move permanent in 2026 - and Kobbie Mainoo's future with the club remains uncertain.",
      "With all that considered, the MEN brings you all of the latest United news and transfer rumours...",
      "That's all for today, Reds.",
      "Thanks for following our live coverage of all things Man United throughout the day. We will return on Thursday morning.",
      "See you then!",
      "TEAMtalk understand that Man United are hoping to sign Zeki Celik from Roma amid interest from Liverpool and Arsenal.",
      "Celik's contract with AS Roma expires at the end of the season, sparking interest from United, Arsenal, Liverpool, Chelsea and Manchester City.",
      "It is said all five clubs have made enquiries about the Turkey international.",
      "Everton are reportedly stepping up contract talks for James Garner amid reported interest from Man United.",
      "The 24-year-old's deal is due to expire at the end of the season and according to talkSPORT, United, Nottingham Forest and Aston Villa are said to be keeping tabs on the situation.",
      "According to the report, Moyes is determined to keep hold of Garner.",
      "TEAMtalk claim Manchester United would like to sign a new centre‑back next summer.",
      "Although Harry Maguire's contract is set to expire at the end of the season, United are still said to want the experienced defender to sign an extension.",
      "Man United's demands over a potential Mainoo exit could put Napoli off ahead of the January transfer window.",
      "Offering an update on the situation, Italian journalist Enrico De Lellis, said: \"In midfield, Mainoo is a real target. United are asking for a no-obligation loan or €50m. Neither option is worthwhile for Napoli,\" he said.",
      "The youngster's outing against Everton marked his first 30‑minute appearance since August.",
      "Manchester United are looking ahead to the January transfer window, where outgoings could be just as important as incomings.",
      "With that in mind, the Daily Mail reports that the club are willing to let three players leave on loan in the coming months. Those being Ayden Heaven, Diego Leon, and Sekou Kone.",
      "The trio have received little senior game time this season, with the possibility of featuring elsewhere bringing them some valuable opportunities to gain some experience.",
      "Joshua Zirkzee has struggled for game time this season, and while an opportunity may arise for him in the absence of Benjamin Sesko, there is no guarantee over his long-term future.",
      "With the January transfer window fast approaching, Gazetta Dello Sport reports that AS Roma are interested in signing the striker. It's stated that an offer of a loan with an option to buy is being readied, which is made a mandatory signing if they secure Champions League qualification.",
      "Manchester United handed Ayden Heaven the opportunity to start for the Under-21s against Solihull Moors on Tuesday, following his inclusion in the first-team squad against Everton. Heaven's only senior start of the season came against Grimsby Town in the Carabao Cup second round. He lasted 64 minutes at Blundell Park before being replaced by Mason Mount.",
      "The defender has made two appearances from the bench in the Premier League against Fulham and Brighton this term, so the decision was made for Heaven to get minutes into his legs with the U21s. Heaven produced a goal-line clearance at the start of the game. He played 66 minutes and the U21s suffered a 4-1 defeat, which confirmed their exit from the National League Cup with a match to play.",
      "It remains to be seen whether Heaven leaves on loan in the January transfer window. The 19-year-old is seen as a first-team player, but he has made just three senior appearances this season. Heaven was signed from Arsenal for around £1million in the last January window and he received praise from Ruben Amorim on the final day of the Premier League campaign.",
      "While Manchester United are aiming to get back into European contention for next season, the team have plenty of free midweeks this campaign to get themselves geared up for their domestic challenges. There is much to keep track of on the continental stage for Ruben Amorim, however, including the development of Rasmus Hojlund during his loan at Napoli.",
      "The striker struggled to convince the United head coach that he could be part of his plans moving forward, with the arrival of Benjamin Sesko reducing the game time available to him. The Danish international then decided to make a return to Serie A, where he was hoping to recapture the type of form he had shown at Atalanta just a few years before his move to Old Trafford.",
      "Hojlund had certainly managed that early on, finding the back of the net four times across all competitions, with two of those coming in the Champions League, but there have been struggles in recent weeks. He could've broken that difficult run in midweek when Napoli took on Qarabag in another huge European tie, as the on-loan Man United forward was given a chance to give his side the lead from the penalty spot.",
      "It wasn't to be, however, as the forward's effort was too central, and goalkeeper Mateusz Kochalski managed to palm the effort away to keep the scores level. It comes as quite a blow to Hojlund, but fortunately, former Man United star Scott McTominay came to the rescue in some fine fashion.",
      "Manchester United goalkeeper Senne Lammens believes it was the right decision to delay his debut for the Reds as he was allowed time to adjust to the pace of the Premier League. After Andre Onana's unconvincing performance at Grimsby Town in the Carabao Cup, Ruben Amorim chose to sign a new goalkeeper before the summer transfer window closed.",
      "Lammens was bought after just one full season at Royal Antwerp and while he arrived in Manchester as an unknown quantity, there was a clamour for him to come straight in to the team. While Onana's exit was almost assured, his replacement Altay Bayindir was also struggling.",
      "Bayindir stayed in goal for matches against Manchester City, Chelsea and Brentford before Lammens was given his chance. Speaking on the latest episode of Inside Carrington, the Belgian explained why he felt the decision was made and why he backed it.",
      "Joao Gomes has been strongly linked with Manchester United ahead of the January transfer window. The Brazilian midfielder has emerged as a potential option to strenghten Ruben Amorim's squad, having impressed during his time in the Premier League.",
      "Gomes, meanwhile, is seen as the ideal replacement with Premier League experience. Signed by Wolves from Flamengo in a £16million deal in 2023, the 24-year-old has made 93 Premier League appearances, complemented by six goals and two assists.",
      "He has been a standout player in a poor Wolves side this term, and this may be the only chance for the club to secure a significant fee for Gomes if they are relegated at the end of the campaign. Gomes still has four-and-a-half years left on his contract at Molineux.",
      "Before the Everton defeat, Amorim addressed the futures of Zirkzee and Mainoo and his verdict was clear. Players will only be leaving Old Trafford if it is deemed to be in the club's interest. Amorim clearly has sympathy for both men and the lack of fixtures this season has not helped either man. In terms of Mainoo, there is no desire to see him leave and the midfielder has been doing everything to earn a spot back in the team.",
      "But, MEN Sport reported at the beginning of the year that talks were not progressing. Allowing him to leave in January is unlikely as things stand but United may have to consider this carefully in the summer if no further progress on his contract is made.",
      "After all the money invested in this area of the pitch in the summer, it may be disheartening to mention that attack will need to be looked at closely in January. Zirkzee struggled in the defeat to Everton and it was further proof he cannot play as a No.9. With that in mind, why not take a punt on selling him and replacing him with someone who could provide competition for Sesko. Whoever they target will be relatively inexpensive due to the money already spent but if they could get him for a good fee, Mateta would be a nice option to have.",
      "There has been no progress on a new contract for Kobbie Mainoo for quite a long time, according to David Ornstein.",
      "After prefacing his comments by explaining that nothing is set in stone and there is still a way to go for the January transfer window, Ornstein told NBC this week: “Kobbie Mainoo is a fascinating one. There’s been no progress on talks over a new contract that expires in 2027. There’s an option to extend it by a year, there’s not really been talks for quite a long time.",
      "“He’s on a low salary, which means Manchester United will be comfortable because it’s not exactly a financial burden, but clubs looking at him might see that as an attractive proposition as well. He wanted to go in the summer on loan, as I revealed at the time. Ruben Amorim says he wants him to stay and fight for a place. I guess he would say that.”",
      "Ornstein also explained how United will need to secure a replacement for Mainoo before he is able to leave, which will prove more expensive than keeping the star on their books.",
      "Former Arsenal defender Bacary Sagna believes Jean-Philippe Mateta is due a big move and could push for transfer, suggesting Manchester United would be the ideal destination given their lack of a recognised No.9. United have scored 19 goals in the Premier League, just five fewer than leaders Arsenal, but Benjamin Sesko has only struck twice in the league.",
      "While they have won three straight against Sunderland, Liverpool and Brighton, they have recently drawn to Nottingham Forest and Tottenham and lost to Everton on Monday.",
      "Ruben Amorim's side continue to struggle for consistency, while summer signing Sesko has yet to find his rhythm following his £73million move from RB Leipzig. Sagna believes Mateta could be the ideal answer for their attack.",
      "While it was recently reported that Manchester United were looking at RB Leipzig’s Assan Ouedraogo, it is suggested that the club are now paying attention to Castello Lukeba. The 22-year-old Frenchman has impressed in the Bundesliga after making the move from Lyon in 2023, and a move could be facilitated by his reported release clause.",
      "Chelsea, Real Madrid and Liverpool have also been linked with the star.",
      "As per TEAMtalk, Jean-Philippe Mateta’s negotiations with Crystal Palace have stalled as a result of salary demands, which could open the door for Manchester United to make a swoop in January.",
      "The striker has thrived at Selhurst Park thus far, but with his contract expiring at the end of 2026/27, the Eagles may opt to move him on instead of running the risk of losing him on a free transfer; a situation they find themselves in with skipper Marc Guehi, who sees his own deal in the capital run down next summer.",
      "Louis Saha would like to see Harry Kane return to the Premier League to chase Alan Shearer's Premier League goals record, albeit in the red of Manchester United rather than the white of Tottenham Hotspur.",
      "Speaking to PunditArena.com, Saha said: \"Harry Kane has earned his position to be the target for Europe’s biggest club, and that’s the best position for him to be in. He would be welcome at any club in the world.",
      "\"He’s a goal scorer, a good guy, a legend and also a leader. He represents football really well, and he is respected by everyone in the game. I really like that. It’s great to see, and he has earned the position he is in, where everyone would want him. I would love him to be at Manchester United of course, and I thought that would be the best move for his career.",
      "\"He’s done it for Bayern Munich, he’s won the league and may win it again. Stats wise, he’s incredible, but at United, he could get Alan Shearer’s record and maybe even add more trophies to his CV. It would be perfect. Harry, forget about Barcelona and Real Madrid, come to Manchester!\"",
      "Manchester United are reportedly eyeing the possibility of signing James Garner from Everton, a player who was instrumental in the Toffees’ 1-0 win over the Reds on Monday.",
      "The midfielder’s current contract on Merseyside is set to expire come season’s end, with the likes of United, Nottingham Forest and Aston Villa said to be keeping tabs on his situation. However, sources have told talkSPORT that David Moyes doesn’t want to lose Garner.",
      "Following Manchester United’s 1-0 loss to Everton on Monday, Joshua Zirkzee could well be on the move in January. The Dutchman has struggled to adapt to the Premier League since making the move to Old Trafford from Bologna last summer.",
      "For context, he managed just three goal in the English top flight last term. And with an uninspired performance against the Toffees earlier this week, in which he hardly looked like finding the back of the net, his future with the Reds has been cast into further speculation.",
      "As per Gazzetta, United could look to loan Zirkzee to Roma in January with an option for the Serie A giants to buy him. The publication also claims that Zirkzee is not opposed to a return to Italian soil.",
      "It was recently revealed that Antoine Semenyo's new five-year deal with Bournemouth holds a release clause in the region of £60million, as United continue to monitor the forward's situation having been linked with him over the summer.",
      "However, it is now claimed that Manchester City are interested in the Ghanaian, who was hailed as 'an extraordinary player' by Pep Guardiola earlier this month. It is thought that the Spaniard also has concerns with a lack of goals from his midfield, meaning he could chase Semenyo's signature when the January transfer window opens.",
      "Tottenham Hotspur and Liverpool are also said to be interested in the 25-year-old.",
      "As per a Globo report, Manchester United should 'intensify' talks with Wolves to sign Joao Gomes by the end of the year. The club are thought to have shown an interest in the midfielder, with negotiations ongoing to broker a deal for around £43million.",
      "Stay tuned as we bring you all of the latest transfer news, rumours and gossip relating to Manchester United."

      "There was a bizarre situation last weekend when Matheus Cunha was forced to miss an appearance to switch on Christmas lights in Altrincham. The organisers of the event posted on social media to say Cunha had pulled out due to “medical reasons.”",
      "Manchester United sources confirmed Cunha had suffered a knock in training. The issue was described as minor, but it was serious enough for him miss the Everton game on Monday. Amorim was asked to clarify the situation ahead of the clash with the Toffees, telling MUTV: \"It was a knock in training so I don’t know how long he’s going to stay out, I think it’s nothing serious.\"",
      "In a separate interview with NBC, Amorim said: “Let’s recover Cunha, and we’ll see if he will be ready for the next game.\" The Reds are next in action against Crystal Palace at Selhurst Park and the expectation is that Cunha will return to the squad, which is a boost after a shocking defeat against Everton.",
      "Everton had 10 men on the pitch for 77 minutes and United could not score. They struggled to create clear-cut opportunities and the few chances that were carved out landed to Zirkzee in the box. Zirkzee is not good enough to be starting for United in the Premier League, and fans will be desperately hoping for a positive update on Cunha ahead of this weekend.",
      "Palace have the second-best defensive record in the top flight this season, with only Arsenal conceding fewer goals (six) than Oliver Glasner's side (9), who are sitting fifth in the table. Glasner has done a magnificent job since his appointment in Croydon. Palace will be hard to break down on Sunday, and Cunha has the quality to create chances or find the back of the net himself.",
      "It would be a boost for Harry Maguire to return to the squad, which will depend on whether the England international has recovered from the hamstring injury he suffered before the international break.",
      "Everton dominated aerial duels at Old Trafford earlier in the week and Maguire's presence at the back was missed. If Maguire passes a fitness test this week, he should come into the starting team for Leny Yoro.",
      "Yoro struggled against Everton. He was culpable in the build-up to Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall's goal from the edge of the box, failing to commit to the challenge, which allowed the Everton man to shoot.",
      "Maguire would have played himself back into the England squad by now if not for picking up a few minor injuries, and Amorim will give an update on his recovery at his press conference on Friday afternoon.",
      "The potential returns of Cunha and Maguire feel crucial for Amorim to pick his strongest possible XI this weekend. United started November with draws against Nottingham Forest and Tottenham, and fingers will be pointed at Amorim again if they end the month with back-to-back defeats.",
      "Amorim was named Premier League manager of the month for October and November was an opportunity to build further momentum ahead of the winter schedule, so the Palace clash is another big fixture.",
      "Mason Mount deserves a recall to the team and Diogo Dalot will likely start in the left wing-back role because Patrick Dorgu had another performance to forget against Everton. Dalot and Dorgu have both been unconvincing on the left this season and United need a new signing for that position.",
      "Strongest XI to face Palace: Lammens, De Ligt, Maguire, Shaw, Amad, Dalot, Casemiro, Fernandes, Mbeumo, Mount, Cunha.",

      "What makes a successful Manchester United team? That is the question which is undoubtedly spinning around the mind of Ruben Amorim this week after a disappointing defeat to Everton on Monday night. In the short-term, the answer seems simple.",
      "United need to purchase players who are going to drastically improve what they are currently offering. They started this approach in the summer with Bryan Mbeumo proving to be much better than those previously occupying the attack. The jury is still out on Benjamin Sesko and Matheus Cunha, albeit they have both had their moments.",
      "Meanwhile, Senne Lammens has been a revelation in goal. Even with his mistake this week, the Belgian has been a vast improvement on Altay Bayindir and Andre Onana. This transfer strategy is one which United will be looking to adopt moving forward but long-term, there needs to be a culture shift at Old Trafford.",
      "For too long there has been a sense of negativity around the club and a concern that too many players are here for the wage packet rather than to take the Reds back to the top. Amorim has worked hard to shape the club in an image which best suits his own.",
      "But changing the culture needs to be spearheaded by the players. And Amorim may find it difficult to replace one key man at the club. Speaking on the Inside Carrington podcast, Lammens was asked by Ben Foster who his 'big brother' was in the squad.",
      "He replied: \"Tom Heaton is the easy answer for me. Just the type of human he is with all the experience and making me feel at home as well. To be honest, the whole goalkeeping group is really good together.\"",
      "Third choice goalkeeper Heaton is out of contract at the end of this season and there is a feeling he may choose to retire this summer. But Lammens' comments are just further evidence of how difficult it will be to replace someone like Heaton in the dressing room.",
      "\"He (Amorim) feels quite strongly about having a group of players that have a strong influence on the dressing room and provides a little bit of support to Bruno [Fernandes],\" Heaton said of the role in August. \"I am obviously honoured as ever to be part of that and will try to have as much influence on it as I possibly can.\"",
      "Heaton is popular in the dressing room and is clearly a big help to Amorim and his staff. Amorim will have no shortage of options for the role if the 39-year-old does depart in the summer. It is about finding the right fit and personality for the dressing room who can use his experience, not only to help his fellow goalkeepers, but to create the perfect culture for success.",
      "Heaton does that role well as evidenced by Lammens' comments so United will need to be careful when it comes to finding a replacement.",

The 27-year-old has been a free agent since leaving Bayer Leverkusen in the summer of 2024 with now Real Madrid head coach Xabi Alonso likely playing a role in the decision to terminate his contract early.",
      "After five years at United, Fosu-Mensah joined the German club in a £1.8million deal during the 2021 January transfer window. Serious knee and hamstring injuries saw him make just 30 appearances for Leverkusen over the span of three-and-a-half years, but he was able to celebrate their historic Bundesliga title win.",
      "Despite having not played competitively since April 2023, the Star is reporting that Fosu-Mensah is being considered by Sheffield Wednesday. The Championship's bottom side are facing relegation to League One after being deducted 12 points.",
      "But, the Owls certainly appear to be doing all they can to avoid being in England's third tier next season as shown by their attempts to sign someone with Fosu-Mensah's experience. United loannee Harry Amass is one of many players at Hillsborough that has impressed in this campaign despite Sheffield Wednesday managing just one victory.",
      "Fosu-Mensah was handed his breakthrough into United's senior team by Louis van Gaal on the same day Marcus Rashford made his debut. He went on to make 30 appearances in the first-team with 11 of those coming under Jose Mourinho.",
      "The right-back has been full of praise for the Portuguese tactician and recently made it clear that he played a big role in helping him mature.",
      "He told The Sun in February 2024: “I spent the full season with the first team and, as a result, completed a full pre-season with them for the first time.",
      "“I was still a teenager when Jose Mourinho arrived, and he helped me mature into becoming a man in footballing terms.",
      "“Jose was tough on young players with his demands, but in a good way, because he wanted you to be ready to represent a club the size of Manchester United.”",
      "Despite that, Fosu-Mensah was unable to make it at Old Trafford and upon realising that, wanted to depart in order to play more regular minutes.",
      "Fosu-Mensah said: “It was my decision. The manager was good to me but at the end, I was not playing a lot. When you are 22, 23, or 24 years old you need to be playing.",
      "“I didn’t play much and I wanted to. It was the best decision in the end to go somewhere else where I would get more minutes.”",
      "Unfortunately, he was able to complete just 1,050 minutes for Leverkusen with the ex-United academy star making his ambitions for the coming years perfectly clear.",
      "Speaking to World Football Index last year, he said: “I have had a few spells out with injury so I want to stay injury free in order to play and perform at the highest level.",
      "“Of course, I want to win more trophies in my career but the most important thing is to be able to enjoy my football and play at the highest level of the game.”",

      "Barcelona manager Hansi Flick believes a \"change of atmosphere\" has put a smile back on Marcus Rashford’s face. Rashford has made a promising start to life at Barca after joining the club on loan from Manchester United during the summer transfer window.",
      "The England international fell out of favour at Old Trafford last season but has found fresh momentum since moving to Spain, scoring six times in all competitions. After missing his side’s 4-0 LaLiga win over Athletic Bilbao on Saturday due to flu, Rashford is back available for tonight’s Champions League showdown against Chelsea at Stamford Bridge.",
      "And Flick is relieved to have the forward back, admitting: “I’m really very happy. He came back from a cold, but he’s OK.",
      "“We’ll decide tomorrow if he starts or not. But I’m happy to have him in our team. I followed him his whole career.",
      "“I was impressed with his quality, what he’s doing in the box in front of the opponent’s goal. He has shown it in Barcelona.",
      "“Also for him this change to live in another culture, with fantastic people, nice weather, it’s amazing. We can see now he’s also smiling a lot. If he can enjoy the atmosphere we have it’s also very good.”",
      "Four of Rashford’s six goals for the La Liga giants have come in the Champions League, including two on the team’s previous visit to England to face Newcastle United in September. But Barca goalkeeper Wojciech Szczesny believes his team-mate 'deserves' even more goals given his contribution to the team so far this season.",
      "Speaking to Barca’s YouTube channel, the former Arsenal man said: “Marcus is an excellent player, I love him a lot. Direct in his play, attacks with speed, and he’s contributed to a lot of goals.",
      "“I think he’s a complete player, and I remember him since he was 18 or 19 in the Premier League. I knew he was special back then.",
      "“He has fewer goals than he deserves, because in training, when he’s having a good day, you can’t stop him. If he shows that magical right foot more in matches, he’ll be very dangerous.”",
      "Rashford spent the second-half of last season at Aston Villa before sealing a dream move to Barca over the summer. The Catalan giants have the option to sign the England man permanently for £28m this summer.",
      "And when asked if he wanted to sign a permanent deal with Barcelona, Rashford recently told ESPN: “Oh yeah, for sure.",
      "“I’m enjoying this football club and I think for anybody who loves football, Barcelona is one of the key clubs in the history of the game. For a player is an honour.",
      "\"People forget this, but 23 years of my life was with Manchester United. So sometimes you just need a change. I think maybe this is the case with me and I'm enjoying everything.\"",

      "Before the Everton game, there was a feeling of positivity around Manchester United which we have not seen for a long time. Last Friday was evidence of this as Ruben Amorim cut a fairly relaxed figure in his press conference. Just before the first section of his media duties ended, the Portuguese head coach was asked about Luke Shaw.",
      "Shaw has largely impressed for United this season and has slotted into the left centre-back role well in the absence of Lisandro Martinez. Amorim was asked whether the defender could play at left wing-back and his response should have immediately raised alarm bells.",
      "He said: \"He can play left wing-back but of course the load that a player does in that position is a little different if you are doing that on a daily basis. He is more prepared to do that position but of course he can play there, he is a smart player and he is fit in the moment so I think he is an option.\"",
      "Against David Moyes' men we saw the issue with playing Shaw in that role. He does not have the engine to bomb up and down the pitch. Against 10 men, United needed to be playing at a high tempo and the onus was on the Reds to make their man advantage count.",
      "But Shaw struggled to lift the pace of the game. When the ball came to him, the tempo dropped and the link-up play with Patrick Dorgu and latterly Diogo Dalot was desperately poor to watch.",
      "\"[Leny] Yoro, I have a little bit more sympathy for but Shaw? That's a waste of time. I don't care. It's not conning anybody. I'm not having it.\"",
      "Is this all Shaw's fault? No. Amorim should have gone to a system which would allow for more attacking creativity. United were crying out for more creativity and Shaw was struggling to provide it.",
      "It proved Shaw is not cut out to be a wing-back in Amorim's system. He showed against Everton he does not have the physical capacity to do that role well.",
      "Shaw has shown this season when his responsibility is to simply defend, he is a good player and can be an asset to United. But Monday proved he cannot be thrust into the wing-back role.",

      "\"I feel afraid of returning the feeling of last season,\" said Ruben Amorim during his press conference after Manchester United's shocking defeat to Everton on Monday night. It was a warning from Amorim that no supporter wanted to hear, but the performance was reminiscent of last season, raising a few worrying questions ahead of the winter schedule.",
      "Although United won 2-1 against Manchester City last December, the month was otherwise bleak for Amorim. United crashed out of the Carabao Cup against Tottenham, were hammered 3-0 by Bournemouth at Old Trafford, lost against Wolves on Boxing Day and were beaten by Newcastle before New Year's Eve.",
      "Next month must be different. United cannot return to the \"feeling\" of last season, but Amorim could seriously do without losing two of his best players to the Africa Cup of Nations. AFCON will take place between December 21 and January 18. Bryan Mbeumo will represent Cameroon at the tournament, while Amad will feature for the Ivory Coast. Noussair Mazraoui will also be there representing hosts Morocco.",
      "Amorim has admitted United will \"struggle a little bit\" when they lose the trio, but explained during his press conference on Friday that talks will take place with the players' federations to keep them for as long as possible. \"I think it’s going to be more or less at the same time,\" said Amorim when asked whether Benjamin Sesko would return from his injury before United lose players to the AFCON.",
      "\"I don’t want to say for sure, but when they are going to camp [to prepare for the tournament], I expect to have Ben back. We have the rules about when to release the players. We’ll see, we’re doing our job to keep the players a little longer. But it's not just in our hands, and we have to respect that, but we will try to do everything to protect the club, protect the players and the national team.\"",
      "Amorim was asked to clarify when the rules stated United would have to release the players, and said: \"I think it's two weeks before the start, so we'll try to arrange something with the federations, but we need to respect their rules in this case.\"",
      "The United boss was also asked whether the Wolves fixture on December 8 was an opportunity for other players to impress. \"Yeah, but we already knew [about players leaving], so it is a chance for other players. We need to also send a message. It is not ideal, they are so important in our squad,\" he said.",
      "United have been in this situation previously, with AFCON looming during the campaign, but losing three players at once to the tournament is a new challenge for the club to manoeuvre. Amorim will be desperate to keep Mbeumo and Amad for as long as possible. Mbeumo has contributed six goals and an assist in 13 appearances this season, while Amad has also been important.",
      "Mbeumo, Amad and Mazraoui will be unavailable from the Wolves games on December 8 if they join up with their respective nations at the standard time, but the precedent set with Andre Onana in 2024 suggests an agreement could be reached to defer their flights to the tournament.",
      "Onana joined up late with Cameroon at the last AFCON. He played against Wigan Athletic and Tottenham in January 2024 (the tournament starts earlier this year) and travelled to the tournament using a private jet, but he was named on the bench for the opening game.",
      "That is something that United's players will consider - they may be willing to join up with their nations late for AFCON, but that could potentially affect their squad roles at the tournament. Mbeumo should be fine because he is a star for Cameroon and would start the first game even if he reports late. However, Amad and Mazraoui compete to start for their respective nations.",
      "United play Bournemouth on December 15 and take on Aston Villa on December 21. Those matches will be tricky and Mbeumo, Amad and Mazraoui could be kept back if an agreement is reached. December will be difficult again, so United will do everything they can to defer AFCON call-ups.",

      "Joshua Zirkzee, Diogo Dalot and Tyrell Malacia were among the Manchester United players showing support to Shea Lacey after the academy star received a call-up to Ruben Amorim's first-team.",
      "The 18-year-old spent the entirety of his youth in the Reds' development system before signing his first professional contract with the club last April. However, he is yet to make his official first-team debut for United.",
      "That might have changed for the winger this week, however, with Amorim opting to include Lacey in his matchday squad for United's clash with Everton on Monday evening. Speaking about the youngster ahead of the fixture, Amorim said: \"I'm really happy with him.",
      "\"He struggled a little bit with injuries but they did a very good job balancing his body and you can sense he can manage more load during training. He has a lot of talent but when they come here they can sense the speed is completely different, so they need to spend more time with us to be prepared because our training is hard.",
      "\"In Premier League games the pressure is harder, so they need to be ready. When you call a kid up to the first team, they need to behave really well. This connection is really important. We are putting everything in place - a nutritionist for the academy starts now - in our club.",
      "\"That is something that should be basic. All these things we are doing, so I have more time with them and I'm more confident with them. When we put these kids in to play in the Premier League, they will struggle, but will struggle less I think.\"",
      "Unfortunately, Lacey did not receive any game time during Monday night's clash, in which, United suffered a 1-0 loss to David Moyes' rejuvenated Toffees. Everton, who were a man down as a result of Idrissa Gueye being sent off in the opening stages of the game for slapping Michael Keane, took a 1-0 lead over the hosts through Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall 29 minutes in.",
      "Despite having the majority of the possession and the lion's share of chances, a Jordan Pickford masterclass prevented the Reds from levelling matters, ensuring that Amorim and his team left Old Trafford empty-handed.",
      "Regardless of failing to make it onto the pitch, Lacey was quick to take to Instagram in the aftermath of the game to share a photo carousel of his night under the bright lights, captioned simply with a love heart emoji. And a number of United first-team players showed their support.",
      "Zirkzee, Dalot, Malacia and Mason Mount all liked the post, alongside fellow academy products in Harry Amass, Ethan Wheatley, Dan Gore, Joe Hugill, Rhys Bennett, Sam Mather and Godwill Kukonki. Willy Kambwala, who left the Reds to sign for Villarreal last year, was also among the names who liked the post.",
      "Gabriel Biancheri, Tyler Fredricson and Jack Fletcher also shared messages of support in the comments section. Lacey could still get his chance to debut for Manchester United this season, especially with Amorim set to lose a number of key players to the Africa Cup of Nations.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo, Amad and Noussair Mazraoui are the players who will jet off to the tournament next month to represent their respective nations, and could be missing from Premier League action until January depending on how Cameroon, the Ivory Coast and Morocco fare.",
      "As a result, Amorim may need to dip into his reserves and academy to make up numbers for fixtures, which could be a chance for the likes of Lacey, Bendito Mantato and Jaydan Kamason to shine bright. Up next for United is a trip to face Crystal Palace at Selhurst Park on Sunday, November 30.",
      "But with two games against Wolves, as well as clashes with West Ham, Bournemouth, Aston Villa and Newcastle United in December, up and coming prospects may get their chance to show exactly what they can do in the English top flight sooner rather than later.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Allardyce explains: “I can still vividly remember what happened to Fabrice a couple of years after I left Bolton. Thanks to immediate CPR and defibrillation, Fabrice made a full recovery. But most grassroots football teams don’t have a medical team on site, which is why it’s critical anyone who plays amateur football – at any level – knows how to perform CPR and use a defibrillator.",
      "“Too many people still think you have to be a medical professional to step in, but that’s simply not true. Anyone can learn these lifesaving skills and if someone collapses, you need to have the confidence to act. “And that confidence comes from training. That’s why I’m urging everyone in grassroots football to take 15 minutes to learn CPR and defibrillation with the BHF’s brilliant free online tool, RevivR.”",

      "Manchester United legends Paul Scholes and Nicky Butt have revealed how they were once consulted over some potential transfer arrivals to the club in a secret meeting.",
      "The pair claim it happened during a spell when Ryan Giggs was named as the interim manager, which occurred during the 2013/14 season following the dismissal of David Moyes.",
      "At the time, Manchester United were looking to rebuild following the end of the Sir Alex Ferguson era, with plenty of big-name transfers following in an attempt to get the side back in the Premier League title picture.",
      "With that in mind, the executive vice-chairman at the time, Ed Woodward, sought out some help from Scholes and Butt to discuss transfer targets, with a four-man shortlist proposed to the pair.",
      "Speaking on The Good, The Bad & The Football podcast, the United legends were asked about how that meeting with Woodward led to Paul Pogba's return.",
      "Butt responded and said: \"I just remember Ryan [Giggs] took control of the club for four or five or six games at the end of the season... then me and Scholesy did it [the meeting] with him and Phil as well.",
      "\"And I remember obviously they were looking for the right manager to come in and take the job, so they obviously needed targets to go and get in the summer.",
      "\"So I had left the training ground and got called back, and there was a meeting with myself, Scholesy, Ryan, and Ed Woodward, and I think Ed Woodward was on a Zoom call; it wasn't so much face-to-face, I think he was in London, and it was like 'Who would you get?'",
      "\"And he gave us a list of midfielders, I know Pogba was one, Kroos weren't you saying? Fabregas might've been one.\"",
      "Scholes added: \"I think Fabregas might've been one as well, I think even Modric might've been one as well.\"",
      "Butt continued: \"I remember we were all discussing pros and cons to them all, and the end of the conversation was 'go for both of them, Kroos and Pogba, because we're Man United and we need to get back to the top'.",
      "\"And if you get one, it's like yin and yang, we mentioned it a while ago, about if you get centre-backs, with Harry Maguire, and you need a footballing player next to him, it's a bit of the same with midfielders.",
      "\"We're not all the same, and you need a bit to complement each other, and that was how it was left, and then they went all-out for Pogba.\"",
      "United went on to re-sign Pogba in August 2016, in a deal from Juventus that could have reached up to £93m with all of the add-ons included.",
      "The French midfielder went on to make 233 appearances for the club, scoring 39 goals and assisting 51 times for his teammates, before leaving in 2022 on a free transfer.",
      "Pogba's career is often reflected on in different ways, with many remembering the magic he could conjure up, while others believe he never found it consistently enough to match the large fee paid for him.",
      "Perhaps the addition of Toni Kroos, Luka Modric, or Cesc Fabregas alongside him could've changed those fortunes, with the former pair impressing at Real Madrid for many more years to come, while the latter had a spell back in England with Chelsea, before featuring in France and then Italy.",

      "Manchester United's return from the international break was marred by a disappointing defeat to Everton at Old Trafford. Despite having strung together three victories and two draws, Ruben Amorim's side couldn't maintain their unbeaten run.",
      "This came despite an early dismissal for Idrissa Gueye, who saw red for striking teammate Michael Keane in the match's early stages. Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall's goal gave Everton the lead a few moments later, presenting a challenge that United failed to overcome.",
      "Despite the worrying loss, there was a glimmer of hope on the bench. Amid the chaos at Old Trafford, academy starlet Shea Lacey found a spot in the matchday squad for the first time.",
      "Tipped for greatness, the England Under-20s international is the latest youth product who could make a significant impact. This could prove crucial in the coming weeks, especially with AFCON seeing Bryan Mbeumo and Amad depart to represent their respective nations in the tournament.",
      "Lacey and Jack Fletcher could play a key role in filling the void left by departing players, highlighting the importance of the academy during challenging times. This comes despite David Moyes' assertion that United has strayed from its roots, with a nod to Sir Alex Ferguson.",
      "Before Monday evening's clash, he told reporters: \"The history of Manchester United was not [one of change]. Manchester United had a great culture. They stuck with their managers; they brought through their own academy boys.",
      "\"They actually had some of the best characteristics of what you would want your club to have: good values. Sir Alex had great values at Manchester United and, over the years, those values he established needed some time to come through as well.",
      "\"It was always a club with brilliant values, with an understanding about bringing their young players through and developing them in the right way.\"",
      "While this may be a critique of United's recent approach, it doesn't apply to Amorim's tenure at the club. The excessive changes seen previously are absent, and it's evident how crucial it is for the manager to properly support the youth players.",
      "Lacey and Fletcher could be the latest examples, with Amorim heaping significant praise on the former ahead of the Everton fixture. The United boss said: \"I'm really happy with him.",
      "\"I think he struggled a little bit with injuries, they did a very good job balancing his body, you can sense that he can manage more load during training.",
      "\"He has a lot of talent, but when they come here, they can sense the speed is completely different, so they need to spend more time with us to be prepared, because our trainings are hard, at Premier League games, with the pressure it's harder, so they need to be ready.\"",
      "It's evident that Amorim understands the development required for Man United academy prospects - not just providing them with chances, but ensuring they transition into senior football appropriately. This became even more apparent when discussing Chido Obi's circumstances.",
      "The young forward made seven Premier League appearances last campaign, yet hasn't featured in a matchday squad this term. Amorim said: \"Yeah, of course [Obi can step up], he played last year. I think it was too soon, we didn't have a team.",
      "\"That we can put a young kid with 16, that he will not struggle, or will struggle a little bit, was completely necessary to do that. The perfect conditions.",
      "\"We have the opportunity and we seek that opportunity for the kids, so he's one of the guys, but I think he started too soon. And sometimes it's hard to deal with that, with the kids, because they think that I'm already here. No, you are here for necessity and we need to be careful also with that.\"",
      "While Man United have been criticised for straying from their traditions in recent years, Amorim is evidently investing significant effort into planning how the academy prospects can be integrated.",
      "This youth development strategy could prove vital in the immediate term for managing squad gaps, whilst over time, it might help restore the club to its former standing.",

      "Manchester United produced their worst league display of the season as they lost 1-0 to 10-man Everton at Old Trafford on Monday night. The Reds started slowly but were handed a boost when Idrissa Gueye was sent off after clashing with teammate Michael Keane.",
      "United went behind just before the half hour mark. Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall went on a weaving run before firing into the top corner of Senne Lammens' goal.",
      "In the second half, United attempted to force the issue but did not do nearly enough to break down the resolute 10 men. Joshua Zirkzee had two headers saved by Jordan Pickford but Everton were good value for their win.",
      "MEN Sport has taken a look at some of the moments you may have missed from the game.",
      "Amad points out fight",
      "The big talking point was the fight between the two Everton teammates which saw Gueye sent off. While the fight will be replayed for years to come, what might be cut out is what Amad did.",
      "Replays showed the Ivorian pointing to what was brewing which perhaps caught the referee's attention. Zirkzee and Bryan Mbeumo, who were in close proximity, were none the wiser to what was happening as they discussed tactics while the drama unfolded behind them.",
      "Everton analysts shout",
      "Just before Dewsbury-Hall's goal, Everton's analysts called exactly what he should do. They shouted 'hit it' - and that's exactly what the former Chelsea man did.",
      "Leny Yoro played his part in that goal by touching into his path. But from an Everton perspective it was a wonder goal.",
      "Zirkzee struggles",
      "Up until the final 15 minutes when Zirkzee forced two good saves from Pickford, his audition to earn a place back in the team was going awfully. The feeling among the fans was clear when they jeered him ducking out of a challenge when the ball was there to be won at waist height.",
      "If he had scored one of those headers, things may have been different but as it was the performance did little to impress.",
      "Mainoo reaction",
      "Another player who could have an eye on the exit door in January is Kobbie Mainoo. If Ruben Amorim wanted to test public opinion on the midfielder he got a big seal of approval.",
      "Arguably the loudest cheer of the night from the home crowd came as Mainoo was subbed on in the second half. His performance did little to earn him a place in the starting XI on Sunday but he remains popular with the fans.",

      "Matthijs de Ligt believes Manchester United lacked urgency against Everton on Monday, which he felt made it difficult for them to break down a team that \"drops back\" and is \"really strong in the air\".",
      "United returned from the November international break undefeated in their last five games in the Premier League, but they suffered a shocking 1-0 defeat against 10-man Everton.",
      "Although Idrissa Gana Gueye was sent off for slapping his own teammate, Michael Keane, in the 13th minute, Everton opened the scoring through Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall. United struggled to create many clear-cut chances as they looked to respond in the second half, and Everton comfortably dealt with crosses into the box.",
      "Ruben Amorim admitted that United deserved to lose during his post-match press conference, and he added: \"I feel afraid of returning this feeling of last season.\"",
      "Speaking to MUTV, De Ligt was visibly disappointed as he reflected on the team's performance. “It’s quite clear, not good,\" he said. \"Today was a bad night for us, especially with the way we played against 10 men. We conceded one goal, didn't create a lot of chances, so overall it was a really bad performance.",
      "\"It's frustrating, but that's football. The Premier League is not for the weak. One chance could be a goal and if they score after one chance and we don't, that makes a difference today.",
      "\"That's football, that's the difference between winning and losing, the efficiency. And today we lacked that, we lacked the urgency to score the goals, create the chances, and against a team like Everton, who drop back and are really strong in the air, it's going to be quite difficult.",
      "\"That basically sums up the night. I'm disappointed with today. The next game is really important now and we have to bounce back. We had some good performances in the last couple of weeks and now we had a bad one. We must come back, stay together and to make clear what has to be better.\"",
      "Amorim said: \"Frustration, disappointment about the way we played the game. They were the better team, with 11 they defend really well for 70 minutes with 10 men. I think we deserved to lose.",
      "\"We didn’t play well, we didn’t play with the right intensity. We talk about this a lot [about what went wrong], I know which point we are at the moment, I have that feeling during this run.",
      "\"We are not there, not even near the point we should be to fight for the best positions in the league. We need to be perfect to win games and we were not.\"",
      "Asked whether some of his players did not show the intensity he wants, Amorim responded: \"We need to find a way, I don’t like to say we can, we show and then it is one game by week.",
      "\"It is not back-to-back, so we need to be ready, 20 minutes in the game, red card for opponent, we need to win that, no matter what. We have a lot to do and we are going to do it.\"",

Read what he said here >>>",

Read here >>>",
      "Amorim's visible frustration on the touchline and United's uninspiring display against Everton confirmed the manager's prior warnings that the team was far from a finished product. The latest setback at Old Trafford was likened to last season's poor displays, with United missing the chance to move into the Champions League qualification places. Read on here >>>",

      "The defeat meant Ruben Amorim's side missed the opportunity to climb back into the top-four ahead of a crucial period of fixtures. The United boss was able to welcome back Lisandro Martinez to the bench for the defeat to the Toffees, but has a lack of options in the final third due to injuries.",

    "source": "manchestereveningnews",
    "body": [
      "Senne Lammens wore a polo shirt and a navy sweatshirt when he visited Old Trafford after signing for Manchester United. The young goalkeeper looked as though he could be joining United to work in their HR department.",
      "The same observation was made when Lammens reported for international duty with Belgium last week - the 23-year-old was dressed in a beige collared jacket, a khaki t-shirt and chinos.",
      "\"By accident, I saw an article saying he was wearing something boring when he reported for international duty and fans saying they hoped he stays like this,\" laughed Hayk Milkon, one of Lammens' former coaches.",
      "\"This 'boringness' is just the way Senne is, he's really calm and no excesses. He focuses on what he needs to focus on and is open with the people around him. He keeps his feet on the ground.\"",
      "If Lammens looks like someone who could work in an office, every workplace would love to have him in their five-a-side team. United believe they have signed a young goalkeeper with huge potential, and fans who were present at Old Trafford against Sunderland left the stadium buzzing about his debut.",
      "The quirk is that Lammens appears to be a different person when he wears his goalkeeper kit. He made a supremely confident United debut, aggressively commanded his area and kept a clean sheet.",
      "Milkon coached Lammens during their time together at Club Brugge. Milkon is now the youngest manager in the Belgian top-flight and Lammens plays for the biggest club in England.",
      "\"It was Senne with his headphones on. He would go into the gym to do his recovery or some extra top-ups. Or he would just go to relax by playing basketball - he loved to play basketball.\"",
      "Milkon coached in different roles at Club Brugge. He was the assistant of Club NXT (their reserve team), served as their interim manager, was in charge of the Under-18s and eventually became a first-team coach.",
      "His time at Club Brugge coincided with Lammens progressing from the academy to their first team, so he is uniquely positioned to provide insight into United's new goalkeeper signing.",
      "Lammens joined Club Brugge's academy when he was 12. \"He was a guy with huge potential,\" said Milkon. \"As I learned from colleagues who had worked with him when he was much younger, I heard there was a moment that clicked in his head when he became super professional.",
      "\"He was one of the guys during Covid - when the players were not able to train - who was doing a lot at home, he was really going far with this to be the best in these types of areas.",
      "\"Then he continued like this when he joined the first team to train with them. He always wanted to improve. We also had something in place to look at the parameters on which goalkeepers are judged.",
      "\"You see the potential of the goalkeeper based on what they do in games; so their positioning, their decision-making and so on, and Senne was always quite high in these areas.",
      "\"The only bad luck that he had was that the first-team goalkeeper was Simon Mignolet. He's an amazing goalkeeper, so it was difficult for Senne to stay over there in the role of No.2.",
      "\"That would have also blocked his growth, so it was good for him in the end to make the step to go to Antwerp and he did a tremendous job there. It was amazing to see how fast he adapted.\"",
      "Milkon continued: \"I think for us at Club Brugge, it was very clear to everyone that Senne was a top goalkeeper. He would have been the perfect fit for Club Brugge to be the No.1.",
      "\"That was not possible because Mignolet was there. But the parameters that we used to judge his performances indicated he was ticking so many boxes already, and he was consistently doing it.",
      "\"There weren't ups and downs with his performances. He was consistently really high and when you compare this to the top goalkeepers, you have a benchmark to say 'Ok, what potential does this guy have?'",
      "\"He had some chances with the first team at Club Brugge and made a mistake, or maybe two, but in the end it was very clear to everyone that he was a top goalkeeper.",
      "\"It was impossible to try to extend his contract because, again, you have Mignolet, and you cannot block a guy like this. You know he has to go out, he has to play, and he will improve even more.\"",
      "When asked about Lammens' strengths, he said: \"I would say that his decision-making was very good. He is very calm, he sees the solutions on the pitch, he has a quick reaction time and understands the balance between risk and reward, and which decisions are the right ones to make.",
      "\"His clean passing is great, his footwork was really good, and he's just an amazing goalkeeper with the shot-stopping. He made some incredible saves back then already. He's quite a complete goalkeeper.",
      "\"But making the right decisions at a very young age, being very mature with this, was really impressive. And the fact that he is good with both feet is another big strength.",
      "\"For me, Senne is a very calm guy and has all the qualities to be a top professional. That was my impression when I first met him when he was younger and he never changed.\"",
      "Lammens joined Royal Antwerp on a free transfer in the summer of 2023. He was handed his debut a few months later and served as an understudy that season, but earned first-choice status for 2024/2025.",
      "His performances drew attention from the Belgian media. Lammens saved four penalties across a successful first full campaign and received a call-up to Belgium's senior squad in March.",
      "Milkon said: \"I was not surprised when I saw Manchester United had come calling. And to record his first clean sheet, I was really happy for him. Senne is a potential No.1 for the Red Devils - the Belgium national team.",
      "\"He got his chance, he took it, and we're all really proud of him, but we knew it would happen. I believe he has all the capabilities to become the best in the world, so I wish him all the best. I'm sure he will have a very good career in England, and Manchester United should return to the big club they used to be.",
      "\"He will have a positive impact on that, for sure, and hopefully he will be Belgium's first-choice goalkeeper soon. I believe he has the potential, the skillset and the personality to do that.",
      "\"For me, it was just having a tiny little part in having an influence on him at Brugge, but it was the most positive memories of our relationship that we had during this spell.",
      "\"I'm very proud that he is reaching these high levels and not surprised. I believe he will be successful because he is a guy who will not change his focus or start to do something different. He is calm, that's his personality and character, and he wants to succeed. He is hungry and will keep working to be his best.",
      "\"He is so calm, and you have to be patient in football. You cannot worry too much and want things too early, but finding the balance between not being impatient and, at the same time, pushing and demanding what you deserve in a good way, means everything will sort itself out.\"",
      "United staff who have worked with Lammens at Carrington have echoed Milkon's sentiments. He has been described as \"really mature for his age\" and is said to have taken the move in his stride.",
      "Lammens is understood to have impressed coaches during training sessions and a United source said that lots of people have been speaking positively about him. He has already relocated from the luxury hotel where he was initially staying and into a house.",
      "It's no surprise that Lammens likes to play basketball at 6ft 3in, but he is a keen golfer, which is common ground with the likes of Tom Heaton, Luke Shaw, Mason Mount and Harry Maguire.",
      "Matthijs de Ligt, Amad, Maguire and Shaw jogged straight to Lammens to congratulate him after full-time against Sunderland. \"Are you Schmeichel in disguise?\" was chanted at Lammens from the Stretford End.",
      "It remains to be seen whether Lammens will start against Liverpool on Sunday, but it would be a surprise to see him on the bench after delivering a strong debut before the international break.",
      "There would be nothing boring about keeping another clean sheet - this time at Anfield.",
      "Kitbag has slashed the price of Man United kits and merch with up to 50% off select items.",

      "With six English teams participating in this season’s Champions League, and the league stage past at its halfway point, it’s already worth having a look to see just how many Premier League teams might get a crack at the Big Cup again next season.",
      "There will once again be 36 rather than 32 teams in next season’s Champions League, and two of those extra places will once again be awarded to the leagues who have been deemed to have performed best in Europe this season.",
      "In six of the last eight seasons, England would have claimed one of those two spots. The first time it actually mattered, they didn’t; England trailed in behind Germany and Italy, with Newcastle and Man United’s pre-Christmas exits from Europe a key early factor before a series of disappointments across all three competitions in the knockout stages.",
      "It proved to be quite a significant sliding doors moment; had England secured a fifth spot that season it would have gone to Tottenham, who instead went off and won the Europa League.",
      "They are thus the sixth Premier League entrant this season, with Newcastle’s prize for finishing fifth upgraded to a Champions League spot with England – unsurprisingly – coming out miles ahead at the top of the overall rankings on the back of winning two of the three trophies as well as having a losing finalist and semi-finalist.",
      "And the whopping nine English teams in European competition this season have already made a strong start in the quest to secure another bonus spot next season.",
      "The system for working out the co-efficient rating that decides which leagues come out on top is (relatively) simple.",
      "Every win in Europe – whether Champions, Europa or Conference League – is worth two points to your country’s tally, and every draw one. There are then assorted bonus points to be awarded based on finishing positions in the bumper final league tables as well as further points for reaching different knockout rounds.",
      "All teams competing in the Champions League phase are awarded six points just for being there – a huge early boost to England’s tally with two thirds of their nine teams in that competition. You get an additional 0.25 points for finishing 24th in the final table, with an extra 0.25 points on offer for each position from there up. So 23rd gets 0.5, 22nd gets 0.75 and so on all the way up to six points for the table-toppers. The Europa League has no bonus points for competing, but again offers 0.25 points to the team that ends 24th and six to the team finishing first on the same sliding scale as the Champions League.",
      "Just to keep us all on our toes, it’s slightly different again in the Conference. Here you get 0.125 points for 24th, and an extra 0.125 points for each position up to ninth, and then 0.25 points for each extra position you can climb in the top eight.",
      "Long story short, the table-toppers in the Champions League get 12 points altogether, Europa League toppers six points, and Conference League four.",
      "Champions League teams then get an extra 1.5 points for each knockout round they participate in (last 16, quarter-final, semi-final, final), Europa League teams one point for each round, and Conference League teams 0.5 points. There are no bonus points on offer for reaching the playoff round that teams finishing between ninth and 24th in each competition have to deal with, but you do still get result points.",
      "So if you qualify for, say, the Champions League quarter-final by winning both legs of your last-16 clash, you collect 5.5 points for your country’s tally: two for each win and a bonus 1.5 points for reaching the next stage. If you get through with a win and a defeat it’s 3.5 points (two for a win, plus the qualification bonus). And so on.",
      "The total number of points accrued by all teams from a particular league are then divided by the total number of teams from that league who began the season in European competition to obtain an average rating that determines the all-important standings.",
      "This also therefore means individual match wins are worth more to the score for a country that had fewer teams involved to begin with; a win for any Portuguese side this season, for instance, is worth 0.400pts to the final tally because it is two points divided by the five teams they had in contention when the season began, while for England a two-point win is worth only 0.222pts to the total after it has been divided by nine.",
      "",
      "Could pay the price down the line when teams start being eliminated and those that are left see their points still being divided by nine, but for now England are streaking clear. The six bonus points awarded to each of the six Champions League teams are a huge help, but they are also picking up consistently solid results.",
      "All six of England’s representatives there look set for the knockout stages, with none currently lower than 16th despite a ropey set of results on matchday five, while Villa and Palace also look near certainties to progress from the Europa and Conference respectively. For all their nonsense, Forest ought to be fine in the end too.",
      "Total points: 93.500\nTotal teams: Nine\nTeams still active: Nine\nLeague stage: Liverpool (UCL), Arsenal (UCL), Manchester City (UCL), Chelsea (UCL), Newcastle (UCL), Tottenham (UCL), Aston Villa (UEL), Nottingham Forest (UEL), Crystal Palace (UECL)",

      "At the moment, Man Utd’s game against Wolves at Molineux on December 8 is due to be their final match before the major tournament, but a report from The Daily Mail are reportedly trying to keep them for the match against Bournemouth on December 15.",
      "United are said to be ‘scrambling to keep this star trio for an extra game’ and they ‘will accelerate discussions’ over their ‘release dates’ in the coming days.",
      "It is also noted that they ‘will seek assistance from the three national federations after Everton exposed the lack of depth in Amorim’s squad’, while they could repeat a ‘struck deal’ with Andre Onana before the 2023 AFCON.",
      "The report claims:",
      "‘Confidential revealed that United struck a deal with Cameroon so Andre Onana ended up missing only one game during the last AFCON two years ago, and Amorim confirmed last week that the club are exploring ways to hold onto Mbeumo, Diallo and Mazraoui for as long as possible.’",
      "Amorim, meanwhile, has issued a warning to summer signing Benjamin Sesko and explained why he is not guaranteed to start for Man Utd when he’s fit.",
      "“We did that against Liverpool. It wasn’t with Bryan Mbeumo, it was with Cunha, and it is an option we have,” Amorim claimed.",
      "“Nowadays, not only in the English league but also in the Portuguese league and across all leagues, there is a big variation in how teams build their play. We do not control it fully. We can call it a 4-4-2, but after five minutes it becomes a 4-3-3 or a 3-4-3.",
      "“I am willing to do anything. Contrary to what many people think, I am not fixed on just one idea. I simply start from a base, but it is obvious that we can adapt in future.",
      "“We have already considered that with Bryan, because he is very strong in transitions. I do not think it is his best position, because he prefers to stay hidden and not be so visible. He can attack and be more dangerous on either side, whether on the right or the left, than as a central forward.",
      "“But it is a good option and something I could use in future, as I have already done several times in the past.”",
      "Ruben Amorim earned himself a little time with an unbeaten Manchester United run, but that defeat to Everton was rotten.",
      "Rio Ferdinand has claimed that the recent record of Arne Slot at Liverpool “reads like” Ruben Amorim at Manchester United, as he wants to see the Reds boss “rinsed” like ...",
      "For David Moyes and Jose Mourinho, resorting to aimless crosses marked the beginning of their ends at Manchester United. Ruben Amorim is repeating history.",
      "Bacary Sagna has told Manchester United that the signing of Jean-Philippe Mateta “makes sense” as the club “don’t have a No.9 who is tall” and can “get on the end ...",
      "According to reports, Manchester United head coach Ruben Amorim was “absolutely furious” with two of his players for their performance against Everton.",
      "Who carries the can for Man Utd being so docile in defeat to Everton? Ruben Amorim’s rigidity did not help, but the players’ passiveness spoke volumes…"

      "“There’s been a lot of talk about his future, will he stay, will he go, will the manager give him more minutes or is he going to stay on the fringes?",
      "“As far as the club are concerned, there are no plans to let him go, because they know if he left it would be the same situation we’ve seen with McTominay.",
      "“He would go and impress wherever he went, and all of a sudden everybody would be asking why he wasn’t allowed to do that at Man United.",

      "Manchester United may need to remodel their left side, especially if Ruben Amorim is sticking around, while two midfielders must be replaced…",
      "Much of Amorim’s first summer in charge at Old Trafford was spent trying to shift players he did not want or saw no future for. It will be a similar story next year if United are serious about a rebuild.",
      "As Amorim marks a year since his first game, here are five players who ought not to be around in 12 months…",
      "",
      "It has been a rough week for Shaw, who bore the brunt of Gary Neville’s frustration on Monday night.",
      "Neville, irked by United’s lack of intensity while chasing the game against Everton, might have been venting but he wasn’t wrong. Shaw was ‘ambling’.",
      "It is an apt description of the former England defender who seem to have become more and more one-paced since entering his 30s. His defending can be passive and though he doesn’t get the same opportunities to bomb on as part of a back three as he might as a wing-back or full-back, you would have to question if Shaw is still capable of that.",
      "At least he is available. He has started all 12 games, compared to just 16 starts over the previous two seasons. Only once in the last four seasons has he started more than half of United’s Premier League games.",
      "Next summer, Shaw will have turned 31 and be entering the final year of a contract that makes him joint fifth among United’s highest earners. Those numbers don’t add up when it comes to INEOSonomics. They already decided the last one was a mistake in 2023.",
      "",
      "We have all held our hands up and admitted we were wrong to write off Casemiro. Some did so more forcefully, disrespectfully than others. This season, the Brazilian has once more become one of United’s most important players.",
      "It is safe to assume, though, that there is little longevity in that status. He will be 34 in February and in the last four months of his massive contract at Old Trafford.",
      "If INEOS were p*ssed about Shaw’s contract, Casemiro’s terms left Sir Jim Ratcliffe apoplectic. The Brazilian is the highest earner at the club, on a salary it is hard to envisage United ever offering again on Ratcliffe’s watch.",
      "More to the point, United desperately need a top-class central midfielder, maybe two. If Casemiro is still the first-choice no.6 next season, we know something has gone terribly wrong with their recruitment.",
      "",
      "Speaking of terrible recruitment…",
      "Ugarte, unfortunately, is damned by Scott McTominay’s stunning success at Napoli. United sold the Ballon d’Or nominee and put that money towards the £50million sent PSG’s way – presumably, much to their astonishment – in an effort to replace Casemiro.",
      "It is perhaps an unfair comparison, but hard to ignore given the trajectories of the two midfielders. McTominay has made himself one of Europe’s most wanted; Ugarte can’t get a game for a team in dire need of his supposed profile.",
      "It takes time to adapt to the Premier League, but it’s been almost a season and a half now. This was the season he needed to step up. And Ugarte looks further away than he ever did.",
      "Having worked with Amorim at Sporting Lisbon, it was thought that Ugarte would be one of the main beneficiaries of the manager’s appointment. But Amorim has been left stunned at the difference in player he bossed at Sporting Lisbon compared to the one who sits on his bench. “He is struggling in the moment,” said Amorim. “He needs to improve, especially in training.” That last part is damning indeed.",
      "Alarm bells were ringing immediately after United signed Zirkzee when no one could really identify what he was. When the question was put to the man himself he admitted that he was neither a no.9 nor a no.10. “I am what I call a false striker. Not a No 9, not a No 10. I am a 9.5.”",
      "It is bad enough when United sign players for positions that are not a priority, but signing a player in a position that does not actually exist was a new low.",
      "So it can come as no surprise that Zirkzee has struggled to adapt. A year after his arrival, United felt it necessary to buy a whole new strikeforce, which left the Netherlands forward in no doubt over his prospects.",
      "Injuries to Benjamin Sesko and Matheus Cunha gave Zirkzee an opportunity to lead Amorim’s line against Everton. “He did alright,” said Amorim, damning the 24-year-old with the faintest of praise. It is not an opportunity he is likely to get again any time soon, assuming Cunha is back for the trip to Palace on Sunday.",
      "",
      "All we’re prepared to commit to here is that if United are to persist with wing-backs, they need a new one for the left flank.",
      "Neville effectively wrote off the entire left side as an attacking threat against Everton, and he wasn’t wrong. Which makes the looming AFCON all the more worrying for United since they will lose Amad Diallo and Bryan Mbeumo, the two players that make their right side so much more potent.",
      "On the opposite side, Amorim seems to favour Dorgu but it’s a close-run thing since neither the Dane nor Dalot have been able to pin down the role as their own.",
      "That’s maybe more understandable in Dalot’s case since he is right-sided. Even if he starts high and wide – not his natural habitat – he is only ever going to drive inside into traffic. Dalot’s versatility has come in useful for numerous managers now since Jose Mourinho signed him while telling the world the Portuguese could be United’s right-back for 10 years. Almost eight years later, he’s not that.",
      "Dorgu, 21, is still a relative rookie having joined United from Parma less than a year ago. But in that time, in 32 appearances, he has as many red cards as assists (one) and no goals.",
      "Beyond the numbers, it is hard to recall any contribution of note. Just a run, a cross, a shot. Anyone?",
      "Dorgu seemed a strange signing given he was a relative rookie and the importance of wing-backs in Amorim’s system. Already, they need another.",
      "It’s a classic football fixture with echoes of the 1970 European Cup final but the Celtic fans are too busy raging at the Desmonds.",
      "Pep Guardiola chucking out a ludicrously expensive second string to lose to Leverkusen got us thinking: what is the best possible Premier League back-up XI?",
      "It’s good news for England after a World Cup draw change, not that you’d know it from one headline, while there’s big news about Martin Odegaard that isn’t.",
      "Liverpool fans reacting to news of a £25m bid for Marc Guehi with anything other than relief shows football has jumped the shark.",
      "Is it already going wrong for Thomas Frank and Tottenham? We think it might be. And we think it might quickly get worse.",
      "Estevao gets all of the love after that Chelsea performance to make Lamine Yamal look like a has-been."

      "When David Moyes said Manchester United “must improve in a number of areas”, he listed three facets of their game. Or, well, the entire sport: “Passing, creating chances and defending.”",
      "He did not cite whipping balls into the box. Little wonder, as exactly two months later his team was breaking the record for the most crosses attempted by a team in a single Premier League game.",
      "Rene Meulensteen called the Manchester United approach “quite straightforward” and “easy to defend against”. Dan Burn had “never headed that many balls since the Conference” and was “happy for them to play like that”. Darren Bent “knew that was going to happen” and was also “happy for them to play like that,” having had as many touches in his own box as the opposition’s despite scoring a last-minute equaliser.",
      "And Moyes admitted it was “as bad as it gets”, with his P45 ultimately swung in 72 days after those 81 crosses epitomised his reign.",
      "This was worse. This was weeks of steadily building progress completely squandered, and Ruben Amorim’s most damaging proclivities coming to the fore again.",
      "It was Moyes securing his first ever Premier League win as a visiting manager at Old Trafford in 18 attempts dating back to 2002, Manchester United suffering their first ever Premier League home defeat after seeing the opposition have a player sent off, and Everton not failing to have a single shot after their goal, but instead rather sagely identifying the distinct lack of any need to try.",
      "They had Idrissa Gueye dismissed for a baffling moment of self-destruction in the 13th minute but produced a performance of determined grit and organised obduracy which had both managers praising the infighting post-match.",
      "MORE ON THE MANCHESTER UNITED MESS FROM F365\n👉 Neville slammed for ‘thinking he’s second coming of Guardiola’ with verdict of ‘ambling’ star\n👉 Amorim ‘furious’ with two stars for ‘completely disregarding instructions’ vs Everton\n👉 Ruben Amorim ‘asking for’ sack with Manchester United tactics v 10-man Everton",
      "“I quite like when my players have a fight,” said Moyes, resisting the obvious temptation to say only that the situation would be handled internally. “I don’t want them to accept someone not doing well enough.”",
      "“I hope my players, when they lose the ball, they fight each other,” Amorim added.",
      "But when the Portuguese also describes it as “my fault” that said players “didn’t understand the moments of the game during the 90 minutes,” and that he needs to better “explain to the players how to play in every situation of the game,” it is difficult to see how Casemiro scrapping with Matthijs de Ligt over a misplaced pass would help.",
      "At least Jose Mourinho controlled the “brain” if not the body of only Luke Shaw, the manager “making every decision” for a player who “cannot play with my understanding of the game”.",
      "Amorim has taken on that responsibility for an entire team which apparently cannot think for itself even when confronted by an opponent with one win in four games, reduced to ten men for 77 minutes and without a win of any kind at that stadium since December 2013, during the mess of the Moyes season when it felt like a team would record their first win at Old Trafford in decades every other week.",
      "If this group needs a coach to issue reminders about the need to raise their intensity and diversify their course of attack somewhat against a team down one player then it is yet again difficult to envisage quite how this arrangement ultimately works.",
      "Manchester United put in 38 crosses against Everton, bringing into question Amorim’s claim about having spent the international break watching what opposition managers do before coming to the conclusion that James Tarkowski and Michael Keane might struggle under an aerial assault.",
      "That is not even close to touching those absurd numbers posted against Fulham but still nine more than their previous season high across 120 minutes on that miserable evening at Grimsby, and their most in a Premier League game since October 2018.",
      "That was when Mourinho was to be sacked regardless of the result delivered against Newcastle, only for Alexis Sanchez to grant him a stay of execution with a last-minute winner in a wretched game.",
      "Mourinho was finally shown the door 73 days later, lasting about 24 hours longer than Moyes after he bore those 81 crosses.",
      "Perhaps that represents a harbinger of doom for Amorim, whose rollercoaster would finally end on February 5 going by that timeline. Manchester United’s last match before that execution date being at home to Fulham is almost too narratively satisfying.",
      "This was every bit as desperate as those displays under patently doomed managers, every inch as uninspiring a gameplan and reaction. That it was so thoroughly exposed by Moyes, long but no longer the poster boy for Manchester United’s era of sustained failure post-Ferguson, was most damning of all.",
      "The list of things Manchester United must improve remains painfully long more than a decade later; despite that slight recent upturn, the manager is still towards the top of it after all these years.",
      "It’s a classic football fixture with echoes of the 1970 European Cup final but the Celtic fans are too busy raging at the Desmonds.",

      "Courtesy of the wonderful FBREF we’ve used the PSxG minus goals allowed metric to rank Premier League goalkeepers. ‘What the f*** is that?’ you might reasonably ask…",
      "Post-shot expected goals is expected goals based on how likely the goalkeeper is to save the shot. When the number of goals they have conceded is subtracted, we are left with the figures below.",
      "FBREF explains that positive numbers suggest better luck or an above-average ability to stop shots.",
      "Including only those who have played three or more games, here’s how the Premier League shot-stoppers are performing this season.",
      "And here’s who was the best goalkeeper in 2024/25.",
      "",
      "Henderson had serene outings against Brentford, Brighton and Wolves, keeping consecutive clean sheets as Palace firm up again. The England keeper will doubtless fancy himself as Thomas Tuchel’s No.1 in USA next summer. Any chance?",
      "",
      "… Not with Pickford in his form. Consecutive clean sheets and a string of saves at Manchester United, who failed to score from a PSxG of 1.8, see the Everton stopper climb here. Pickford just needs to avoid a crash in form to cruise into the World Cup as Tuchel’s No.1.",
      "",
      "Spurs being wretched against Chelsea wasn’t bad news for everyone at Spurs – Vicario padded his stats by conceding just one from a PSxG of 3.2. But six goals conceded in the draw with Manchester United and the miserable north London derby defeat came from a combined PSxG of 4.6.",
      "",
      "Replacing clean sheet machine Trafford at Burnley, Dubravka has made a very solid start at Turf Moor. Which is handy since he has faced more shots than any other goalkeeper. Might already have save of the season tied up after preserving Burnley’s win at Wolves in the dying seconds but should have done more to prevent West Ham’s second and third goals.",
      "What a save from Dubravka 🧤 pic.twitter.com/YmY4Lq2abB",
      "",
      "Verbruggen’s rotten record last season didn’t stop him once again being linked with the likes of Bayern Munich in the summer. In recent weeks, the Dutchman looked more like a goalkeeper who might catch the eye of the big boys after a shakier start to the season and the late, win-preserving penalty save against Brentford sees him climb here.",
      "",
      "Fat lot of good topping this list after the first three games did Trafford. This is likely to be his number for the rest of the season unless Gianluigi Donnarumma suffers a misfortune.",
      "",
      "Sunderland fans have been raving about Roefs after his start to life on Wearside and everyone else is starting to see what the fuss is about. Only Dubravka has made more saves and no-one has a higher saves percentage (79.2%).",
      "",
      "The massive Italian has emerged as City’s undisputed No.1 to the shock of no one and the horror of James Trafford. Donnarumma has made a solid start to life in the Premier League but showed for the first time against Bournemouth some vulnerability to crosses.",
      "",
      "His England recall was scuppered by a concussion suffered at Brentford and a run of five clean sheets in the first seven games has been followed by none in five.",
      "",
      "Lammens dazzled United fans with some simple competency but the first questions were asked of the Belgian after Everton’s win at Old Trafford from 0.4 PSxG. Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall’s shot was within reach, but Lammens was caught off balance and forced to push off the wrong foot, reducing the distance he could dive.",

      "",
      "Life is rarely quiet when Martinez has the mitts on. He began the season well, then tailed off quite alarmingly, but a clean sheet and a penalty save against Bournemouth was more like it. Then he went to Leeds and conceded a shocker.",
      "",
      "Last season’s joint winner of the Golden Glove award had a wretched few weeks, falling 13 places in this list before facing Leeds then Liverpool. In no game have Forest faced fewer shots on target than Arne Slot’s side managed at Anfield.",
      "",
      "Johnstone has been more reliable than Jose Sa but Sunderland’s opener cut the ex-England keeper in half; Burnley’s first took him by surprise; and he might feel he could have kept out the first of Fulham’s three. Harsh? Probably. At Chelsea, he was powerless to stop any of the Blues’ three second-half goals and it was a similar story in the defeat to Palace.",
      "",
      "It almost doesn’t matter what Sanchez does, everyone has already decided that Chelsea need an upgrade. And they are probably correct.",

      "Alisson’s return came as a relief after five games out but even he was powerless to stop Liverpool caving against Forest, who scored three from a PSxG of 2.5.",
      "",
      "Leno was bouncing back from a poor season by his own high standards with an impressive start to this campaign but defeats at Villa and Bournemouth were expensive for the German when it comes to this particular metric. Clean sheets against Wolves and Sunderland have provided a small boost.",
      "",
      "Raya faced more shots on his target at Sunderland than the previous four games combined. He kept out neither of them. Then he conceded to Spurs from their only shot on target which had a PSxG of 0.1.",
      "",
      "Literally no one views Bayindir as a credible No.1, including Ruben Amorim. Since he was dropped for Lammens, United haven’t lost. Coincidence?",
      "",
      "Was one of the biggest climbers in recent weeks but conceded two to Villa from a PSxG of 1.5. Leeds fans are especially unhappy at his failure to move for Morgan Rogers’ free-kick which, admittedly, did not look good.",
      "",
      "You have to feel for Hermansen. He seemed to be bought on the hop by the Hammers and was thrown into a team flailing badly. Taken out of the firing line now, with Areola back in under Nuno.",
      "",
      "Darlow replaced Lucas Perri after the Brazilian sustained an injury and the stand-in’s form kept him in Daniel Farke’s XI. But Spurs and Burnley scoring four goals from an xG of 1.05 was not a good look on Darlow.",

      "Mamardashvili came into the side just as Liverpool had forgotten the basics of defending. There have been goals for which the big Georgian was beaten rather easily so a clean sheet against Villa was much-needed for his confidence. Only to be stitched up by Virgil van Dijk at City, where saving an Erling Haaland penalty couldn’t spare him from falling here.",

      "“There’s been no club–club talks at this point, but of course if Wolves are staring at relegation come January, they might look to cash in on him then…",
      "“Other options Manchester United clearly like are Elliot Anderson, Adam Wharton, and Baleba too.”",
      "Man Utd could also sign a new striker to provide competition for Sesko and ex-Arsenal defender Bacary Sagna has explained why they should prioritise Crystal Palace star Jean-Philippe Mateta.",

      "“It will also be difficult for Palace to keep hold of him, and it’s the right moment for him to move if he wants the test of playing for one of the biggest teams in the Premier League.",
      "“He’s not a young player anymore and it might be one of the last moves of his career, so he will probably push for it if the opportunity arises.”",

      "After nearly two months of glorious respite, here we are yet again, apportioning blame for Manchester United being sh*te.",
      "The Red Devils were dire in defeat to Everton, despite David Moyes side playing all but 13 minutes with 10 men. So submissive were the hosts at Old Trafford that the Toffees literally fighting among themselves was highlighted as one of the many areas United could improve.",
      "Who is responsible for a performance that lacked minimum levels of intensity, nous and ingenuity?",
      "The short answer: all of ’em. There is enough blame to spread around all the coaching staff and squad inside the United dressing room. We’ve conducted this post-mortem many, many times before. Must we open the corpse yet again? Oh, we must…",
      "Jamie Carragher says the manager should ‘take a lot of the blame’ after sticking so rigidly to his formation, despite the events that were unfolding in front of him.",
      "“It is my fault,” said Amorim post-match, accepting responsibility in that way that managers do, when they have no intention of shouldering the blame for anything other than picking from a group of players who, apparently, cannot think for themselves.",
      "“I need to be better, to explain to the players how to play in every situation of the game.” The fact he immediately then zeroed in on those players’ for “starting the game with a different intensity” to Everton was a more accurate reflection of his mindset.",
      "This is the thing with Amorim. He is honest. Sometimes painfully so. He is so dreadful at hiding his frustration when his players fail to achieve the bare minimum that he no longer tries. Not really.",
      "It is actually quite endearing. And it almost certainly buys him more patience with Stretford Enders than his results deserve. But the credit earned by his honesty and open disdain for the players wrecking his head is almost immediately wiped out by his absolute, devout devotion to his system. Carragher called it is ‘baby’ and we hope for his actual children’s sake that Amorim is never put in the admittedly unlikely situation where he has to choose between them or 3-4-2-1.",
      "We are only left to speculate why the United players, seemingly dead behind the eyes, steadfastly remained in that very formation, with no will or wherewithal for spontaneity, after Idrissa Gueye’s early red card.",
      "It should have been on Luke Shaw or Lenny Yoro to step forward as United’s extra man, an advantage they wasted by clinging to their defensive position like a tatty comfort blanket.",
      "Was that Amorim’s insistence? Or are all of his players now so drilled in this shape that any adaptation is utterly beyond them? Tell us either is true and we would not question it.",
      "The abject inability of players to think for themselves, or even look after themselves, is a far wider problem beyond Old Trafford. Coaches preach about empowering players to find solutions in the game while simultaneously prescribing every minor movement in and out of possession. The contradiction goes all the way to academies and grassroots, leaving us with players at every level incapable of reacting to any scenario they haven’t meticulously rehearsed.",
      "The game is poorer because we forget that football is about players, not cultish coaches and their desire to show how pure and clever their philosophy is. Which, with almost no exceptions, is ripped off someone else anyway.",
      "But at the top level, it is easy to understand why coaches insist on mapping out every intricate detail, each run and pass, when they are only ever five games from the sack. If Amorim, like many managers at other clubs, was to place any of his faith in these players, he knows he is destined for a fall. So, instead, it becomes about systems, not players.",
      "If Amorim genuinely feels he must “explain to the players how to play in every situation of the game”, he’s screwed. But he doesn’t really. Yet he’s still screwed.",
      "Because after a year in charge and some glimmers of encouragement of late that must have had United players believing their own press through the international break, they can still turn up and turn in performances like this which are part of a pattern against teams in the bottom half.",
      "Slate Amorim for his system or his like-for-like substitutes, but it was clear from literally the first minute that United’s players were failing to match the intensity of their visitors, despite the chance to position themselves among the Champions League chasers. Motivation cannot and should not be spoon-fed by the manager, it has to come from within.",
      "Passing up that opportunity so meekly – or worse, failing even to recognise it – says more about this United side than the five games they went unbeaten just to remain in their rightful place: entrenched in mid-table.",
      "It’s a classic football fixture with echoes of the 1970 European Cup final but the Celtic fans are too busy raging at the Desmonds.",
      "Pep Guardiola chucking out a ludicrously expensive second string to lose to Leverkusen got us thinking: what is the best possible Premier League back-up XI?",
      "It’s good news for England after a World Cup draw change, not that you’d know it from one headline, while there’s big news about Martin Odegaard that isn’t.",
      "Liverpool fans reacting to news of a £25m bid for Marc Guehi with anything other than relief shows football has jumped the shark.",
      "Is it already going wrong for Thomas Frank and Tottenham? We think it might be. And we think it might quickly get worse.",
      "According to reports, Manchester United are about to step up their efforts to keep three players set for the African Cup of Nations for an extra game."

This misses the point that managers resign from jobs incredibly rarely, unless they have another job to go to, because they can stay and be paid to leave. That looks unlikely in Slot’s case because there doesn’t seem to be an obvious replacement out there for him.",
      "It would be a bold decision on his part to leave at this very moment. The Premier League is mad this year in terms of how bunched up so many teams are. To use Crystal Palace as an example, before this season their best points return after 12 games was 19 (six wins and one draw, 2015-16), which put them in 10th place, and the only other time they’ve won as many as five games (with two draws), 2020-21, had them 11th with 17 points.",
      "This year, with five wins (and five draws), they have 20 points and are 5th, one point behind Aston Villa in the final Champions League place. The three-point gap between Villa and Liverpool is comparable to the equivalents (final playoff place to 13th) in the Championship, League One and League Two, all of which are infamously built on shifting sands. It’s entirely conceivable that if Liverpool could turn things around in very short order and be right back in the mix for the top four. Automatic Champions League qualification would constitute a successful season (if not a successful title defence).",
      "* Speaking of bold decisions to leave a club, Saturday saw Rob Edwards take charge of Wolves for the first time. Now, maybe it’s just me but I’ve never understood why people, and it tends to be a certain type of British manager more than most, would leave an environment where they are building something special and overachieving to move up the pecking order to a basket case club where it is incredibly likely they will fail. Graham Potter is a strong example here, leaving Brighton to go to a chaotic Chelsea where he was found to be out of his depth in fairly short order. His reputation took a hit and, following his time at West Ham, hasn’t really recovered.",
      "Edwards, meanwhile, has just left a Middlesbrough side he got well on course for promotion to join a club looking incredibly likely to pass them going the other way. His old side have lost just two league games so far this season, his new side have lost all bar two. It will be a truly remarkable feat if Edwards can keep Wolves in the Premier League, but it’s easy to think his best chance of managing in the Premier League beyond this year would have been to stay with Boro.",
      "* One of the reasons supporting Crystal Palace is rarely dull for long is that they keep defying expectations. That’s probably why so many of us expected them to lose to a Wolves team they should, on paper, beat comfortably. Instead, we were treated to the sort of professional performance that shouldn’t be an issue but too often is. Palace were, by some distance, the better team on Saturday afternoon and their win, combined with results elsewhere, took them temporarily to fourth in the table (they’ve since been overtaken by Aston Villa).",
      "* During the international break the Athletic published two articles about Palace, one discussing their struggles to break down a low block and the other about how they had never won the first game back from an international break under Oliver Glasner. This, and the game against Wolves, highlight why Glasner is so well-liked amongst the fans in a way that many of his predecessors weren’t. He gets that it won’t be perfect, because it’s Palace, but he gets a lot right. He’s a planner but he’s also has good judgement about when to change the plan or when to stick to it.",
      "The only concern fans do have is that he is exacerbating the lack of squad depth he has previously commented on by not rotating players or leaving it late to make substitutions. His first change on Saturday, Eddie Nketiah on for Jean-Philippe Mateta, was a subtle tactical shift even if it was one centre-forward for another, but a goal arrived a couple of minutes afterwards. Then, with the game at 2-0 and largely over as a contest, he waited a further 12 minutes to make any more substitutions.",
      "It’s a minor thing, but the fresh legs in midfield being introduced straight after the goal, for example, would have sent a message to those players that they were being trusted to see out a winning position for an extended period. But as I say, it’s a very minor thing.\nEd Quoththeraven",

      "Luke Shaw came under fire as Man Utd's defeat to Everton raised more questions of Ruben Amorim's system; Gary Neville on Luke Shaw against Everton: \"He's ambling. You can't do that. He should be running forward every single time\"",
      "By Nick Wright, Oliver Yew and Adam Smith",
      "Tuesday 25 November 2025 15:06, UK",
      "Gary Neville slammed Luke Shaw's lack of intensity as Manchester United slumped to another low under head coach Ruben Amorim with their 1-0 defeat to 10-man Everton.",
      "The 30-year-old, playing as the left-sided centre-back in Ruben Amorim's back three, was singled out for \"ambling\" forward as Manchester United tried, and failed, to recover from a goal down.",
      "Shaw is one of four Manchester United players, along with Matthijs De Ligt, Bruno Fernandes and Bryan Mbeumo, to have started every Premier League game this season. It has been a rare period of availability for a player dogged by fitness issues.",
      "Last season, he only completed 90 minutes once in the Premier League, having only done so seven times in the campaign before that. You have to go back to 2022/23 for the last time he managed to feature consistently across a full season.",
      "Staying fit has proved a major challenge for Shaw.",
      "Once a marauding full-back with the energy to shuttle between the two boxes, his physicality is not what it used to be. His lack of intensity against Everton riled Neville with Manchester United trailing against 10 men and needing a goal.",
      "\"You have Shaw, [Leny] Yoro and [Matthijs] De Ligt behind the ball,\" he said on co-commentary. \"Shaw is getting forward more, but he's ambling forward, let's be clear. He's been bugging me for the last 20 minutes. He's ambling. You can't do that.",
      "\"He should be running forward every single time. I don't care. Yoro, I have a little bit more sympathy for but Shaw? That's a waste of time. I don't care. It's not conning anybody. I'm not having it.\"",
      "Shaw's physical decline can be seen in the numbers. There is a caveat in that he has been used in a role which requires less running under Amorim, as a centre-back rather than a full-back, but the drop-off in many areas predates the head coach's arrival.",
      "Shaw's sprints and kilometres covered per 90 minutes have followed a downward trend and his attacking output has also declined.",
      "Shaw has steadily contributed fewer crosses, goal involvements and chances created over the course of the last five seasons.",
      "Gary Neville says Manchester United's performance in the 1-0 defeat to 10-man Everton \"smelt of complacency\" and will \"erode trust\" in Ruben Amorim's team.",
      "Despite Shaw's limitations, Amorim's system once again came under intense scrutiny.",
      "Still trailing, Amorim made changes to try and get back into the game, bringing on Diogo Dalot for Patrick Dorgu and Kobbie Mainoo for Casemiro. They were like-for-like substitution as the United boss left Shaw, De Ligt and Yoro on the pitch, sticking with his three-at-the back system for the full 90 minutes.",
      "It was a move that left many Man Utd fans frustrated, particularly bringing on the right-footed Dalot to play in front of Shaw as the pair ended up getting in each other's way on Manchester United's left side.",
      "\"You have to have urgency and make the pitch as big as possible, and you have to put as many players as possible in forward areas,\" said Neville.",
      "\"Ruben Amorim has a question to answer,\" he added.",
      "\"Bringing Dalot on over there in front of Shaw? I don't quite see it. You have five at the back, why? Embarrassing.",
      "\"This should be like the Alamo. Really quick, high-tempo passing side-to-side, getting into good wide areas, putting crosses in, getting bodies in attack, sustaining attacks. It's very slow from United. There is no presence in the box whatsoever.\"",
      "Once again, Amorim being wedded to his 3-4-3 formation and his reluctance to change in-game proved costly for United. His devotion to playing three at the back has come to be seen as a flaw, especially when trying to chase games.",
      "Questions will be asked again of Amorim and his flexibility. It's hard to see why he kept his three central defenders on the pitch and didn't throw extra attackers on against Everton when it was obvious they were lacking a focal point in the absence of the injured Benjamin Sesko and Matheus Cunha, something which was also highlighted by Jamie Carragher after the game on Monday Night Football.",
      "\"Ruben Amorim feels like the first manager I've seen who sticks with a system rather than an idea of how to play,\" Carragher said. \"It feels like the formation is his baby and to not change it or alter it in certain situations like that [against Everton], I don't understand how you can stick with it so steadfastly.",
      "\"If you have to stick with the system, put a midfielder in defence, which we have seen managers do in the past, because you are going to have so much of the ball.",
      "\"It's not about losing the three points against Everton, I think it is one of those moments where people will really question the manager. He will take a lot of the blame.\"",
      "Amorim still has Lisandro Martinez to return from injury. The Argentina international will likely slot back into the left-sided centre-back role, but Shaw looks unsuited to playing at wing-back and Amorim's other options are also underperforming.",
      "At Sporting, his wing-backs were attacking outlets vital in making his system work. In his final full season in charge, in 2023/24, Nuno Santos, Geny Catamo and Ricardo Esagio, his three most-used wing-backs, contributed a combined total of 26 goals or assists between them in league games alone.",
      "Amorim's wing-backs at Manchester United have contributed half as many goals or assists across a similar number of league games.",
      "And nine of their 13 goals and assists, roughly 70 per cent, have come from Amad Diallo, with the others used in the position, Dorgu, Dalot, Noussair Mazraoui, Harry Amass and Tyrell Malacia, only managing four between them in a combined 67 starts at wing-back.",
      "The struggles of Amorim's wing-backs raise further questions about Amorim's devotion to his system. If they are not contributing offensively, then what are they really bringing to the table?",
      "It is just one of many questions for their under-fire head coach, who can add Shaw's decline to a growing list of problems.",

      "Neville says United, who could have gone fourth if they won by three but remain in 10th, \"were nowhere near good enough\" and \"an embarrassment at times\" as their five-game unbeaten run came to an end.",
      "\"It just smelt of complacency. They weren't at it from the beginning. That is a bad one for United.",

      "With Everton down to 10 men for over 75 minutes after Idrissa Gueye's red card for striking his own team-mate Michael Keane, Amorim's side failed to break down a team who have only mustered one away win all season - against bottom side Wolves.",
      "It was the first time United have ever lost a home Premier League game after seeing the opposition pick up a red card, with United winning 36 of the 46 games in which it has happened before. It was also David Moyes' first ever win at Old Trafford as an opposition manager at the 18th attempt.",

      "That moment should have allowed United to completely control of the game - if anything it did the opposite. Amorim's side looked like the team with 10 men - and Everton deservedly took the lead through Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall's stunner from distance.",

      "Idrissa Gueye was sent off after just 13 minutes for striking Everton team-mate Michael Keane at Manchester United; Gary Neville: \"They were not fighting, it wasn't a scrap. It could have been dealt with by a yellow. I don't think it needed to be a red\"; Gueye set for three-game suspension",
      "Tuesday 25 November 2025 07:18, UK",
      "Everton midfielder Idrissa Gueye was sent off for striking team-mate Michael Keane just 13 minutes into the Toffees' remarkable Premier League win at Manchester United.",
      "The incident was sparked when Gueye - who misplaced a loose pass towards Keane in the penalty area to give the ball away - began berating his team-mate.",
      "Gueye then raised his hand to Keane's face before he was sent off for violent conduct by referee Tony Harrington.",
      "Despite his sending off, Everton went on to win 1-0 thanks to Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall's 29th-minute goal, and afterwards Gueye apologised to his team-mates in the changing room and released a statement on social media.",
      "He wrote on Instagram: \"I want to apologise first to my team-mate Michael. I take full responsibility for my reaction.",
      "\"I also apologise to my team-mates, the staff, the fans and the club. What happened does not reflect who I am or the values I stand for. Emotions can run high, but nothing justifies such behaviour. I'll make sure it never happens again.\"",
      "However, Everton boss Moyes said he \"likes his players fighting each other\" when asked about the incident.",
      "\"I thought the referee could have taken a bit longer to think about it. I got told that the rules of the game that if you slap your own player, you could be in trouble.",
      "\"But there's another side to it: I like my players fighting each other if someone didn't do the right action. If you want that toughness and resilience to get a result, you want someone to act on it.",
      "\"I'm disappointed we got the sending off. But we've all been footballers, we get angry with our team-mates. He's apologised for the sending off, he's praised the players and thanked them for it and apologised for what happened.\"",
      "Man Utd head coach Ruben Amorim also disagreed with the red card and criticised his players for not showing enough fight.",
      "He said: \"Fighting is not a bad thing. Fighting doesn't mean they don't like each other. Fighting is if you lose the ball, I will fight you because we will suffer a goal. That was my feeling with that red card.",
      "\"I don't agree with that sending off. We can fight with team-mates. I know it's violent conduct, the referee explained it, I don't agree with that. I hope my players, when they lose the ball, they fight each other. I hope they don't get sent off, but that is a good feeling not a bad feeling.",
      "\"My players showed in many games we can do it. Today, we didn't. I need to help them. We need to be better in the future.\"",
      "Everton's match-winner, Dewsbury-Hall, called Gueye's red card a \"moment of madness\".",
      "\"But all I can say is Idrissa has apologised to us at full-time, said his piece, and that's all he can do. We move on from it.",
      "\"The reaction from us was unbelievable. Top tier. We could have crumbled, but if anything, it made us grow.",
      "\"He [Moyes, at half-time] just said: that's done now. We'll deal with that another time. It was about keeping to the plan we had. He made sure we do the right things, continue what we're doing. We can't change that now, second half we continued to do that.\"",
      "\"How much venom was in that slap?\" said Neville. \"He has been sent off for that. Was it a little slap or a proper whack?",
      "\"There is no doubt a hand comes out to the face but it didn't look too much. They might have had to send him off purely because there is a strike to the face.",
      "\"They were not fighting, it wasn't a scrap. It could have been dealt with by a yellow. I don't think it needed to be a red.\"",
      "Jamie Carragher said at half-time in the Monday Night Football studio: \"I just think: can a referee manage the situation a bit better?",
      "\"Can you get the two of them together and say: 'Hey can you behave yourselves?' Just sort of manage the situation, rather than that's the rulebook.",
      "\"The rulebook gives the referee a bit of an out. He could say: 'I don't think it's over the top' and then you can carry on 11 vs 11.\"",
      "Monday Night Football guest Roberto Martinez, the Portugal head coach, agreed with the red card decision.",
      "The ex-Everton boss said: \"Clearly, it's a misunderstanding; Gueye is trying to play the ball [to Keane], but it's that reaction, the slap.",
      "\"The referee has no other choice because the law tells you that any aggression above the neck is a red card.\"",
      "According to the Premier League rules, striking an opponent or any other person on the head or face with their hand or arm represents violent conduct, unless the force used was negligible.",
      "\"Was it negligible?\" pondered Neville. \"That's the question. I think it was negligible. I don't think there was much in that at all.\"",
      "Gueye is now set to be suspended for Everton's next three games.",
      "The Senegal international became the first Premier League player sent off for striking his own team-mate since Ricardo Fuller for Stoke City against West Ham in 2008.",
      "It was only the third time a player has been sent off for striking a team-mate, after Lee Bowyer and Kieron Dyer's infamous double-red card in 2005.",
      "When Bowyer and Dyer clashed in 2005, the former was handed a seven-game ban in total - an initial four games for it being his second red card of the season, before the FA handed an additional three matches to the suspension.",
      "Bowyer was also given a £30,000 fine, with the midfielder then leaving for West Ham in the following summer.",
      "Meanwhile, in 2008, Stoke striker Fuller was sent off for striking his captain Andy Fuller. The striker claimed the situation actually helped team morale. Fuller stayed at Stoke until 2012.",
      "\"It's one of those things. It's done and dusted, and it's made us stronger as a unit,\" Fuller said.",
      "\"Sometimes in life, negatives can bring about positives, and I'm pleased that we've got by it in a positive way.\"",
