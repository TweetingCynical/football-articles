      "Ex-Manchester United defender Axel Tuanzebe is reportedly seeking £1million in damages from his former club for allegedly harming his career. Tuanzebe, who now plays for Burnley, claims United are to blame for medical issues which he says continue to impact his career.",
      "The 27-year-old made 37 first-team appearances for United after coming through the club’s academy. He left at the end of the 2022/23 season upon the expiration of his contract and, following a two-year spell with Ipswich, joined Burnley in the summer.",
      "It emerged in July that Tuanzebe was filing a lawsuit against United for alleged “clinical negligence”. The Congolese international has struggled with injuries throughout his career and Sky News has now seen details of the allegations.",
      "Tuanzebe is reportedly alleging that United failed to treat an injury \"promptly\" and \"appropriately\", leaving him with more serious long-term problems. He claims he still cannot play \"without restriction or impediment\" due to the impact of the original injury.",
      "The lawsuit has now reportedly been lodged at the High Court in London and says Tuanzebe \"expects to recover damages in excess of £1,000,000\". United refused to comment when contacted by Sky News.",
      "The case centres around stress fractures at the back of the spine, which Tuanzebe first picked up in January 2020 and which had allegedly become chronic by July 2022.",
      "The lawsuit argues: \"Appropriate treatment plans would, on the balance of probabilities, have resulted in the claimant avoiding the pain and discomfort set out below and would have resulted in him being able to play professional football at elite level without restriction or impediment. As it is, although he continues to play at an elite level, this has impacted his career and earnings.\"",
      "It further states: \"It is the claimant's case that the defendant [United] negligently failed to properly investigate the claimant's pars fractures, failed to rest the claimant and failed to refer him to a specialist sports spinal surgeon.",
      "\"As a result, the claimant's symptoms significantly progressed to bilateral grade 4 fractures, and he developed a left-sided chronic spinal fracture. Had the claimant been appropriately rested, his left-sided pars fracture would not have developed into a chronic condition and the right-sided fracture would have been avoided altogether.\"",
      "Tuanzebe alleges he has been in \"significant pain and discomfort” since July 2022. His case is that his employers \"failed to refer him to a specialist sports spinal surgeon\" in January 2020 when the stress fracture first occurred.",
      "The defender spent 17 years at United, having first joined the club as an eight-year-old. He came through the ranks in the academy, playing 38 times for the under-21s while being capped at youth level by England before later choosing to represent the country of his birth, DR Congo.",
      "Tuanzebe has made seven appearances in the Premier League and Carabao Cup for Burnley this season. After shaking off an injury, which saw him miss Burnley’s 3-2 defeat by United in August, he has started the last five league games for Scott Parker’s side.",

      "Ruben Amorim could push for Manchester United to extend Casemiro’s contract on one condition after being impressed by his performances this season. The veteran midfielder’s current deal is due to expire on June 30, but United have the option to extend it by 12 months.",
      "Casemiro was linked with a lucrative move to Saudi Arabia in the summer transfer window, but made it clear that he wanted to stay at Old Trafford and fight for his place in Amorim’s side. The 33-year-old, who cost £70million from Real Madrid in 2022, has done just that, re-establishing himself as Amorim’s first-choice in central midfield.",
      "He has been crucial to United this season, returning three goals and one assist in 10 Premier League appearances. His form has also helped revitalise his international career with Brazil, where his former Real manager Carlo Ancelotti has been similarly impressed.",
      "Casemiro was handed a contract worth around £350,000-a-week when he joined United over three years ago. And his sky-high wages have often been used as an argument for letting him go when his deal expires in the summer.",
      "But his efforts this season are earning him plenty of supporters inside the club, not least with Amorim himself, who talkSPORT says is considering keeping him for another year. Casemiro is a hugely popular member of the squad and his experience and leadership qualities have been crucial in the team’s upturn in form of late.",
      "Amorim would reportedly support a contract extension for Casemiro, who turns 34 in February, provided he agrees to take a pay cut. Asked about his performances after the 4-2 win over Brighton last month, Amorim said: “I think he gives a lot of experience. He's an example for everyone.",
      "“In the beginning, he was behind every midfielder, even Toby [Collyer], but he fought and he worked, and now he's back in the national team. He's so important for us.”",
      "Amorim was asked about Casemiro’s situation before the draw with Tottenham on the weekend. He said: “Yeah, we don’t know what is going to happen. My goal is to continue to count with Casemiro, with Harry Maguire, that he has the same problem.",
      "“I don’t know what is going to happen. Let’s focus on this season. I’m really happy with Casemiro, he is really important. I’m really happy with Harry, but I know what you guys are asking, let’s focus on this season and then we’ll see the next season.”",
      "And Casemiro has addressed his plans too. “Football is my life, right? So it’s inevitable [to continue],” he said. “But I think my wife and family will want some time for themselves, yes.",
      "“I’m one of those who think that in life you have to have a plan. But I’m into short-term goals. Of course, it’s inevitable to think about being in good shape for a World Cup, but you can’t expect to be in good shape for the World Cup if you’re not doing well at Manchester United.”",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Manchester United's squad rallied behind Tyrell Malacia's return to first-team training last month, following the Dutch left-back's stint in Ruben Amorim's infamous 'bomb squad'. The 26-year-old, who had expressed his wish to leave Old Trafford in the summer, was one of five players who made their intentions clear.",
      "Malacia found it difficult to secure regular playing time after recovering from a severe knee injury and spent the second half of the previous season on loan at PSV. Despite pushing for a move during the off-season, he failed to secure a transfer, unlike teammates Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho, Antony and Alejandro Garnacho.",
      "The Dutch defender was the sole survivor of the 'bomb squad' at United post the summer transfer window, leading to Amorim's decision to reintegrate him into the first-team setup. He was spotted back in senior training on October 1 and later named as a substitute for the Brighton match that month.",
      "As per The Athletic, United's players fully supported Amorim's decision to bring Malacia back into the mix, and the head coach took this feedback on board when selecting the squad for the Brighton game.",
      "Malacia joined United in a £13million deal from Feyenoord in July 2022, marking Erik ten Hag's inaugural signing as the Red Devils' boss. He quickly became a key player in Ten Hag's team during his debut season, making 39 appearances across all competitions and contributing to the Reds' Carabao Cup victory.",
      "However, in the summer of 2023, Malacia was sidelined for a year and a half after undergoing knee surgery. He made his much-anticipated return for the Under-21s in the EFL Trophy in November 2024, and later that month, he also featured in the Europa League match against Bodo/Glimt.",
      "Despite this, Malacia's time on the pitch at United was limited, leading him to decide to go out on loan to get more game time during the second half of the 2024/25 season. Indeed, he joined PSV on loan in February.",
      "During his stint at PSV, he made 11 appearances, including two against Arsenal in the Champions League, and helped the club secure the Eredivisie title for the second consecutive season.",
      "After his loan spell at PSV ended in the summer, Malacia returned to United but has not played any competitive football since. He was named in the United matchday squad once for the Brighton game on October 25, but remained on the bench.",

      "The latest international break is upon us, and that means the majority of Ruben Amorim's squad will be jetting off across the globe to represent their national teams.",
      "Currently, 15 members of the squad will not be at Carrington for the next few days as Manchester United gear up for the home game against Everton on Monday, 24 November. Saturday's late 2-2 draw with Tottenham means that United will be aiming to extend their five-match unbeaten streak.",
      "While Amorim and his staff will have a reduced squad over the international break, it does provide them with an opportunity to work more closely with the players who have remained behind. Most have simply been omitted from their respective national squads for the upcoming fixtures.",
      "However, there is one significant injury worry for United with striker Benjamin Sesko withdrawing from the Slovenia squad due to a knee injury he sustained in the draw against Spurs. Sesko will continue to be assessed at United this week but it is believed that the injury is not a serious one,",
      "There was also an injury scare over Casemiro. The midfielder was substituted against Tottenham, but, as it stands he is still set to link up with the Brazil squad.",
      "One player who won't be with the club, but is not expected to feature in international games is defender Lisandro Martinez. He has just returned to training with United as he steps up his recovery from a major knee injury.",
      "He's set to link up with the Argentina team for training, despite not being named in the squad for the upcoming international fixtures.",
      "A total of 11 players, including Sesko, will remain at United during the break. He's likely to use this time to recover from his injury and could be joined by defender Harry Maguire, who was the third player to be pulled out against Spurs.",
      "The England centre-back wasn't selected for Thomas Tuchel's squad for the matches against Serbia and Albania, meaning he can undergo any necessary rehab at Carrington.",
      "Four other England internationals will stay at United after not being selected for the squad. Luke Shaw, Mason Mount, Kobbie Mainoo and Tom Heaton will all be focusing on the Everton match and working more closely with Amorim.",
      "They'll be joined by young talents Ayden Heaven, Tyler Fredricson and Chido Obi who will all aim to impress in a bid to break into the first team squad. Tyrell Malacia and Joshua Zirkzee will also be around the squad over the international break after not being called up to the Netherlands squad.",
      "The smaller squad could provide an opportunity for some other young players to join in with first-team training to boost the numbers working with Amorim and his coaching staff. As for those away on international duty, United will be keeping a close eye on their progress, hoping they return fit and healthy.",

      "Joshua Zirkzee may have another route out of Manchester United, with Everton becoming the latest club to reportedly show an interest in his signature. The Dutch forward has previously been linked to West Ham and a range of European clubs as he struggles for minutes under Ruben Amorim.",
      "Zirkzee has made five appearances this term and been on the pitch for just 90 minutes after United strengthened their forward options in the summer. After the arrivals of Benjamin Sesko, Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo, Zirkzee has found himself well down the pecking order.",
      "Last month, West Ham were noted to be preparing a loan offer for the forward, undeterred by United's reluctance to part ways. Everton are now said to be targeting a forward in January and could provide some competition.",
      "Zirkzee's chances may have been boosted with the same report suggesting Gabriel Jesus will be out of the Toffees' reach. Mikel Arteta has said the injured forward won’t be moving.",
      "Napoli and Juventus have previously been linked with an attempt to land Zirkzee, while Roma are also said to be interested. The latter could even consider terminating Evan Ferguson’s loan from Brighton to facilitate a move.",
      "Asked about the prospects of exits for Zirkzee and Kobbie Mainoo, earlier this season, Amorim said he understood the noise over their futures. United's boss made it clear the pair belong to the Red Devils, however.",
      "\"That is normal, and I also know that in our club, everything is a lot of noise, and you have to have news, and players are not playing,\" he said.",
      "\"They want to play. Like you said, there’s a World Cup. There are agents that listen to the players talking all the time. So, I understand that but they are our players, and we need everyone to have a good season.\"",
      "Zirkzee is expected to ask to leave United in the next transfer window. The £36million forward has failed to make an impact after signing last year, as he bagged just seven goals in 49 appearances in all competitions.",
      "Netherlands boss Ronald Koeman has told his countryman that he must start more games to be considered for the World Cup, should the team qualify for next summer's tournament in North America. Zirkzee would prefer to remain in the Premier League, but is willing to return to a European club.",

      "Doubts have been raised over whether Alejandro Garnacho can continue his fine form for Chelsea despite John Terry praising his \"petrifying\" ability. The 21-year-old endured a challenging start to the season after spending two of the Blues' first five matches across all competitions on the bench.",
      "However, the Argentine has since established himself as Enzo Maresca's first-choice left winger, scoring two goals and providing two assists in his last four appearances. Garnacho has earned plaudits for his recent performances, with Chelsea legend Terry hailing his star turn in last Saturday's 3-0 win over Wolves, where he provided assists for both Malo Gusto and Pedro Neto.",
      "As per the Metro, the former England captain said: \"[It's] absolutely petrifying as a defender when you're facing someone that quick and that direct. He gives us something the other wingers don’t as well. That's what you want to see as a Chelsea fan - players like that beating players. It doesn't always have to be with loads of skill.\"",
      "Garnacho's upturn in form could potentially leave Manchester United boss Ruben Amorim red-faced after completing his £40million move from Old Trafford to Chelsea in August. The switch occurred following Garnacho's spat with Amorim over his limited game time in the Europa League final.",
      "However, ex-United and Wrexham goalkeeper Ben Foster has questioned how long he will be able to sustain his current level of performance. The retired shot-stopper questioned Garnacho's mentality and suggested he could struggle against better teams, with players waiting in the wings to take his starting place at Chelsea.",
      "Discussing Garnacho's display against Wolves on his Fozcast podcast, Foster said: \"He looked really sharp and looked really nice to be fair. He was really good and maybe he needed that as a little bit of a springboard. But with that Chelsea team, I just don't know who's going to start.",
      "\"They've got so many players who can play in those sorts of positions that it's really hard for a player to get a string of games and a run of form. He needs a bit of an arm around him and for someone to go, 'You're going to start the next six games and you're going to be my best player.'",
      "\"The ability is there and the talent is there, but I think most of the time it's in his head. He's going to come up against much bigger, better, faster and stronger opposition than Wolves.\"",
      "While Foster is unsure of Garnacho's long-term credentials, Chelsea's head coach was left impressed by what he saw against Wolves.",
      "Speaking after the final whistle, Maresca said: \"He's doing very well on the ball, but he's doing very, very well off the ball. He knows that to play with us, he has to be good on the ball and off the ball; otherwise, he's not going to play. We are very happy with him at this moment.\"",
      "Alan Shearer also highlighted his display on Match of the Day, saying: \"I think it was his best game today. He caused problems all evening down the left-hand side. Whoever was coming up against him, he had more pace than them.",
      "\"He went past them with ease and he was a real threat in putting good balls into the box for his forwards. Of course, they benefited from that. I thought he looked really, really comfortable.\"",

      "A statement from the FA on Tuesday read: “Burnley's Hannibal Mejbri has been charged with misconduct following their Premier League fixture against Leeds United on Saturday 18 October. It's alleged that the player acted in breach of the Laws of the Game and/or in an improper manner and/or used abusive and/or indecent behaviour by spitting at or in the direction of Leeds United supporters around the 67th minute.

We are currently working with Burnley Football Club to establish the facts.\"",

      "Manchester United have set their sights on Nottingham Forest midfielder, Elliot Anderson. The 23-year-old has emerged as a prime target for Ruben Amorim's side, who are keen to bolster their central midfield.",
      "Anderson joined Forest from Newcastle United last summer in a hefty £35million deal. In his debut season at the City Ground, he made a whopping 42 appearances across all competitions, playing a pivotal role in Forest's seventh-place finish in the Premier League and their journey to the FA Cup semi-finals.",
      "Despite Forest's lacklustre start to the 2025/26 season, Anderson's performance has been consistently stellar. After an exceptional first season with Forest, he earned his maiden call-up to the England senior squad in August. He has since shone in a Three Lions shirt, starting four matches against Andorra, Serbia, Wales and Latvia.",
      "Forest have been notified about United's intention to pursue the Whitley Bay-born star, but the Reds are expected to demand a staggering fee of at least £100m, if not closer to £120m. If United manage to secure Anderson for that price, or even higher, it would smash the club's transfer record, currently held by Paul Pogba's £89m switch from Juventus to United in 2016.",
      "Such a colossal move would be a game-changer for Ruben Amorim and United, but the club might need to generate funds through player sales before they can splash out nine figures on Anderson.",
      "So, how could they raise the necessary cash? A good starting point would be to review the players currently out on loan and assess if any of them could fetch a hefty fee. At present, Marcus Rashford seems the most likely candidate for a sale next summer.",
      "The 28-year-old moved to Barcelona on a season-long loan in July and has been in fine form for the La Liga side, netting six goals and setting up nine more in 16 appearances across all competitions. Barcelona, who are footing Rashford's £8m salary for the season, have an option to buy him for £26m at the end of his loan spell.",
      "If Barca's finances allow, this deal appears highly probable at this stage, providing United with a tidy profit. Another potential sale is Rasmus Hojlund.",
      "The Danish striker has found the back of the net four times in 10 games since joining Napoli on loan in August, and Antonio Conte's team have the option to make his move permanent for £38m next summer. If United can secure that amount for the ex-Atalanta player, it would provide a welcome boost to their Anderson war chest.",
      "Jadon Sancho, the third high-profile United player currently on loan, was loaned to Aston Villa in the summer. Although Villa don't have an option to buy the 25-year-old, his long-term future at Old Trafford seems uncertain. With a valuation of £20m, selling him could be the best solution.",
      "Andre Onana, is spending the season away from Manchester after a late move to Turkish side Trabzonspor. Despite United paying £47.5m for the 29-year-old Cameroon international from Inter Milan in 2023, he's now valued at £26m, with United likely to get around £15m for him.",
      "Selling Rashford, Hojlund, Sancho and Onana could bring in at least £85m, if not more, meaning United would only need a small amount more to afford Anderson. However, United could sell a prized asset not just to afford Anderson but also to gain funds to strengthen other areas of the team.",
      "Cashing in on Kobbie Mainoo could enable the Red Devils to achieve that. The 20-year-old has been limited to just 138 minutes of Premier League football this season, raising concerns about his future at United, with Chelsea among others showing interest.",
      "Mainoo is valued at around £45m, and while that might seem low for his age and potential, United might need to sell him just to make room for Anderson in the squad.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Cristiano Ronaldo believes he has one or two years left in the game and says the 2026 World Cup finals will “definitely” be his last.",
      "The 40-year-old Portugal international was asked about his future in an interview via video link at the TOURISE Riyadh event on Tuesday, having told Piers Morgan Uncensored last week he would retire “soon”. He initially joked on Tuesday that “soon” meant “in 10 years” before adding: “When I mean soon…. I’m really enjoying the moment right now. As you know in football, when you reach some age you count the months very quick.",
      "“So, the moment is good, I feel very good in this moment, I score goals, I still feel quick and sharp, I’m enjoying my game in the national team and Al Nassr, but of course, let’s be honest, when I mean ‘soon’ it’s probably one, two years I’ll still be in the game.”",
      "Asked if that meant the 2026 World Cup would be his last, he replied: “Definitely, yes, because I will be 41 years old and I think it will be the moment, and in a big competition.",
      "“As I told you before, I am enjoying the moment, but when I mean soon, it’s really soon because I give everything for football, I’m in the game for the last 25 years, I did everything, I have many records in the different scenarios in the clubs and also in the national team – I’m really proud.",
      "“So let’s enjoy the moment and live the moment.”",
      "The World Cup remains the biggest trophy to have so far eluded Ronaldo throughout an illustrious career, having won the Euros with Portugal in 2016. Ronaldo signed a new two-year contract with Al Nassr in June. Piers Morgan asked Ronaldo in an interview which aired last week when he would retire.",
      "“Soon. But I think I will be prepared,” Ronaldo said. “It will be tough, of course. It will be difficult? Yes. Probably (I) will cry, yes… I’m (an) open person. (It) will be very, very difficult, yes.”",

    "source": "mirror",
    "body": [
      "Senne Lammens has been praised for the calm way in which he's established himself as Manchester United's first-choice goalkeeper. Eyebrows were initially raised when the young Belgian shot-stopper was signed from Royal Antwerp in a £18.2million deal on transfer deadline day on September 1.",
      "The 23-year-old was viewed as an unknown quantity when he arrived at Old Trafford without having earned a single senior cap for Belgium. However, Andre Onana headed into the campaign with major doubts over his abilities whilst Altay Bayindir had also not convinced.",
      "After one too many errors from Onana saw him sent on loan to Turkish club Trabzonspor, United head coach Ruben Amorim soon turned to Lammens. He has seized the opportunity with both hands after keeping a clean sheet on his debut against Sunderland and with the Red Devils currently unbeaten in their last five games.",
      "Former United and Wrexham keeper Ben Foster believes that upturn in form can partly be attributed to the confidence displayed by Lammens between the sticks. His conviction in his own strengths stands in stark contrast to Onana, who appeared drained of any self-belief by the time he left.",
      "Discussing Lammens' performances during an appearance on talkSPORT, Foster said: \"I didn't know what to expect at the beginning. It's a massive step up and you need somebody with a bit of authority and a bit of an aura about them to step into that Manchester United team.",
      "\"But he's done it so far with absolute ease and he's got this confidence about him. He's coming out for balls into the box, where you're normally talking about seriously seasoned Premier League goalies that do this kind of stuff and he's doing it from the get-go.",
      "\"It still remains to be seen whether he's got the X factor and the little bits that turn a good goalie into a great goalkeeper. Whether Senne Lammens has that in his game remains to be seen.\"",
      "Foster was initially cynical about Lammens' arrival after previously claiming it would take a \"miracle\" for the signing to be successful. However, he has since revised his opinion based on the keeper's assured displays in goal.",
      "United legend Rio Ferdinand has also waxed lyrical about Lammens' contribution, with Amorim's side currently seventh in the Premier League after their dramatic 2-2 draw at Tottenham on Saturday.",
      "He said on his YouTube channel: \"You can't talk about anyone being our most important player without mentioning the goalkeeper. It's no coincidence we've had an upturn in form. We've got a goalkeeper that it seems all the players trust.\"",
      "Lammens was recently branded as \"boring\" by some United fans on social media as a compliment after he turned up for Belgium national duty in beige clothing. It's a label the keeper himself is only too happy to embrace as he aims to become known for his consistency.",
      "\"I understand I might come across as 'boring' but that's the goalkeeper I want to be,\" he told Belgian publication HLN. \"I don't do anything crazy. In recent years, players have come through here who...weren't boring. But I want to stand for consistency. Staying calm, in good times and bad.",
      "\"If you want a successful career, you have to have that quality, I think. I saw that in Simon Mignolet (at Club Brugge) and Jean Butez (at Antwerp). They were my role models. I was able to steal from them with my eyes.\"",

      "Former Manchester United striker Louis Saha has rubbished suggestions that £28million represents a steal for Barcelona to land Marcus Rashford permanently. The England forward was loaned out to the Catalan club for the season after Red Devils head coach Ruben Amorim decided he wasn't part of his plans.",
      "Barcelona have secured an option to make the switch permanent for £28m come 2026, with multiple reports in Spain claiming they're already plotting to secure an agreement with United. Rashford has been a revelation since arriving in Spain, bagging six goals and providing nine assists in all competitions whilst wearing the famous Blaugrana strip.",
      "The 28-year-old currently leads the way for assists among players across Europe's elite divisions. However, Saha - who enjoyed a four-year stint at Old Trafford - isn't convinced that Barca's £28m buy-out clause represents outstanding value given Rashford's recent troubles at United.",
      "\"I think Marcus Rashford does provide a bit of worry,\" he said via OLBG. \"You have to manage him. What happened to him at United?\".",
      "\"I think something could happen again so I think that he has to have his own objective. I think he needs to come back to that level and maintain that to be in the World Cup and win it. That's what I hope for him.",
      "\"But yes, it's not a bargain because of what he went through in a really tough moment. He didn't play well for two years. He had a lot of issues.",
      "\"Now they are solved and it's not solved because of United, just because he is in a new environment. I think he managed to get back to the basics, which is good for him.\"",
      "The United academy graduate has already made his stance on Barcelona clear - expressing a desire to stay at the club for many years. \"I'm really enjoying my time in Spain; the weather is the best,\" he said.",

      "They say you never lose it - and that's what Wythenshawe Vets are counting on with their star-studded over-35s squad, packed with Premier League cult heroes.",
      "You may've seen clips on social media showing ex-Newcastle striker Papiss Cisse score EIGHT goals in their 13-0 win against South Liverpool on Sunday. The match was played in their humble surroundings of Hollyhedge Park in Wythenshawe, Greater Manchester.",
      "It's a far cry from the arenas that the 10 former Premier League players on their books once played in front of, but they love it all the same. The Vets boast combined 1,867 Premier League appearances, 389 international caps and 15 major honours in their ranks - as well as plenty of flash cars seen on a matchday.",
      "Stephen Ireland, Emile Heskey, Maynor Figueroa, Joleon Lescott, Oumar Niasse, Nedum Onuoha, George Boyd, Danny Drinkwater and Jefferson Montero have turned out in the Cheshire Vets League Premier Division alongside Cisse. The players pay £15 per month in subs and ex-Leicester and Chelsea midfielder Drinkwater believes that it's 'just as enjoyable as playing in the Premier League'.",
      "\"You do a token 10-minute warmup, you're having a laugh and you have a pint afterwards - it's as good as it's going to get,\" he added. \"The values are obviously different in professional football, but you can enjoy it just as much.",
      "\"It's like estate football, which is what you enjoyed as a kid. There's loads of banter. I was chuckling away on the pitch today.\"",
      "The team came together after ex-Manchester City midfielder Ireland, who's close friends Wythenshawe player Blake Norton, fancied a game on a Sunday. Ireland had been playing 'low-key' seven-a-side matches alongside some fellow former pros on Tuesday nights.",
      "\"I came down in pre-season just because I love playing football,\" he explained. \"I love the fitness side of things. I invited some of the others and slowly but surely everyone wants to play. It's competitive and it's going from strength to strength.",
      "\"I didn't want it to be something where 15 of us ex-pros came in and took over, I want a good mix with the old vets lads. It's a nice humbling experience to interact with fans as well. It's great to give back and the club have been so nice to me. We're all local as well.\"",
      "And now a bigger superstar could be about to join them.",
      "According to the Mail, none other than Wayne Rooney is keen to get involved. The ex-England captain and Manchester United legend is currently filling his diary with media appearances, but he's frequently played in charity matches such as Soccer Aid.",
      "\"Imagine that, that would be unreal. Rooney in the No.10 slot, wouldn't be bad that,\" Drinkwater quipped.",
      "Ireland says that they've had feverish interest, revealing: \"My phone hasn't stopped! I've got people going, 'how do I get involved, how do I sign up?'",
      "\"I just want to be wary of not bringing too many people, because I want it to be a mix of the proper old vets with maybe four or five pros each time. But it is great fun, even as an incentive during the week to prepare for it. That's what it's like now.\"",
      "The club also have a history with Man United - and there's a smidge of bad blood. In 1956, Wythenshawe AFC drew 1-1 with United in the Whitaker Cup Final against a side that included Sir Bobby Charlton.",
      "The match ended after extra-time and the cup was shared, with both clubs 'agreeing' to hold it for six months each. According to a Wythenshawe official, though, United didn't upheld their end of the bargain and kept hold of it for the full year.",
      "It's also been reported the UFC icon Conor McGregor is attempting to sort out a match involving Wythenshawe in Dublin next month. Could the crowds of hundreds one-day be thousands?",
      "\"Ultimately, we're a community‑owned club and this is highlighting what we do in the area,\" chairman Carl Barratt. \"For what Stevie Ireland has done, because he's been the catalyst to get people involved along with Kieran (Megran, manager), it's been superb.",
      "\"Wythenshawe is not the most affluent area but hopefully this can contribute to us getting more players, generating more money and the feel-good factor around the place … you can just sense it.\"",

      "Sesko was United's third major signing in attack following the arrivals of Matheus Cunha from Wolves and Bryan Mbeumo from Brentford. However, he has so far failed to live up to the hype, only scoring twice in 12 games before picking up a knee injury at the weekend.",
      "That goal return has led to him coming in for criticism, but Rooney believes not only will the striker come good, but his hard work is making life easier for his fellow team-mates. Speaking on the latest Overlap Fan Debate, he said: \"He's going through a bit of a tough time in terms of goals scored.",
      "\"I think the goalkeeper has come in and done well, he's been more direct in to Sesko, but what we are seeing now is he can compete, he does hold the ball up better than Hojlund does. We are seeing as the ball is going up to him, Mbeumo, Cunha, Mount making runs in behind.",
      "\"Because they know he will compete and he will win flick-ons and he will do that, so I think he has been better than what people [are] maybe suggesting, but I still think he needs to just get the ball, get hold of it, lay it off and get in the box and hope that the chances are created for him. I think he has been OK and will come good.\"",
      "Sesko is now be facing a spell on the sidelines after picking up a knee injury against Tottenham Hotspur at the weekend. The forward was introduced from the bench in the 58th minute at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, but he lasted just half an hour before having to be replaced.",
      "He did not report for international duty at the Slovenian FA’s headquarters in Brdo pri Kranju on Monday and will continue to be assessed at Carrington this week. Sources, though, have indicated the injury is not thought to be a major issue.",
      "But even with just under a fortnight to rest, Sesko is likely to be a doubt when United return to domestic action on Monday, November 24, against Everton. Following United's 2-2 draw with Nottingham Forest at the start of the month, Gary Neville claimed the forward looked \"miles off it\".",
      "\"I’m no further forward with him, the jury’s still out,\" he said on NBC Sports. \"He’s miles off it compared to the other forwards United brought in, like Cunha and Mbeumo.",
      "\"He looks awkward, his touch was off a few times when balls went over the top. For £80m [sic], yes, he’s young and still settling, but you want to see something more.\"",

      "Speaking to the ex-United star he begged the defender to make contact with some of the players to teach them some of the basics. He said on Ferdinand's YouTube channel: \"I just watched the United game, one of our biggest problems is when we invite pressure onto ourselves.",

Shaw is the only one that seems like he understands. All they know is system, lineup and play well. They don't know how to step up, push the defender and then go back into your line. I push up (as a defender) and the midfield slots in. Please Rio, get to somebody.\"",
      "United have conceded 18 times so far this season - the joint most of any side sitting in the top half of the table. They have looked more assured since settling on Senne Lammens as their goalkeeper, but issues still remain.",
      "Ferdinand was less alarmed than Bolt, claiming fans need to temper their expectations with Amorim very much in a rebuilding phase. The team finished 15th last term and a return to the European places this term would be seen as a step forward.",

      "Manchester United are said to have made contact with Nottingham Forest over the potential signing of Elliot Anderson as the midfielder continues to attract high-profile suitors.",
      "The England man has shone for the Midlands outfit since his arrival from Newcastle in 2024 and his performances at the City Ground have provided him with the platform to establish himself in the national team set-up ahead of next year's World Cup. Unfortunately for Forest, Anderson’s fine form has also not gone unnoticed by some of their domestic rival.",
      "As per Sky in Germany, United chiefs have registered their interest in the 23-year-old, with Forest now aware of their position. However, the Europa League side are not keen on selling.",
      "The report adds that Forest would demand in the region of £100m-£120m to even consider a sale, with United unlikely to stump up a fee anywhere near that level. Anderson has just under four years left to run on the contract that he signed at the City Ground last summer, meaning Forest are in a strong bargaining position.",
      "The midfielder was signed for around £35m, with Greek goalkeeper Odysseas Vlachodimos moving in the opposite direction as both Newcastle and Forest attempted to abide by PSR rules. Anderson has since made 56 appearances for Forest, scoring on three occasions. He has also managed to amass four caps for England.",
      "“I feel full of confidence coming off the back end of the Euros, and I want to carry it on,” he said to Telegraph Sport in an interview earlier this season. “My focus there was just on performing and putting myself in the best position possible for the seniors.",
      "“That’s all I’ve done and that’s what I’ll continue to do. I’m in a really good place now. I’ve got to carry on my performances at club level with Forest and see where it takes me. My biggest aim this season is to add some numbers [goals and assists] to my performances, that will probably take me to the next level.”",
      "Asked if his move to Forest was a surprise, Anderson added: “Yeah, 100 per cent. It definitely was. I didn’t really see it coming, but it’s the new rules in football these days. I got a phone call while I was away on holiday, telling me I was possibly going to leave. A few days later I was flying to Nottingham.",
      "“I’ve come to Forest and it’s really benefitted me as a player, but maybe I didn’t see it like that when I left Newcastle. Everything happens for a reason and it’s been a great move for me. I’m really enjoying my football.”",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Ruben Amorim smashed a TV in the dressing room after an abject Manchester United were beaten by Brighton back in January - but his outburst is thought to have worked in his favour.",
      "The Portuguese boss was only months into his tenure when the tide starting going against him. After a difficult December saw United lose five times - three of those at Old Trafford - things failed to improve in January. And Amorim was left with even more issues when Brighton left Old Trafford with a 3-1 victory as former player Danny Welbeck got on the scoresheet and Andre Onana made another costly blunder.",
      "The Portuguese boss couldn't hide his frustration as he read his players the riot act and subsequently smashed a television as he reached boiling point following another chastening home defeat.",
      "However, The Telegraph reports that his extreme act resonated positively with a number of the United players. They fully understood how much he cared as he lamented their situation and it's said that some even gained more respect for the former Sporting Lisbon boss.",
      "It was on that Sunday afternoon that Amorim himself controversially suggested that his side were \"maybe the worst\" in the 147-year history of the club as they faced the prospect of a relegation battle.",
      "He said: \"In [the past] 10 games in Premier League, we won two. Imagine what this is for a fan of Manchester United. Imagine what this is for me. We are getting a new coach who is losing more than the last coach. I have full knowledge of that. We are the worst team maybe in the history of Manchester United. I know you [media] want headlines but I am saying that because we have to acknowledge that and to change that. Here you go: your headlines.\"",
      "Amorim also displayed a clear disapproval for his team's performance when they faced Everton in February - a month after their Brighton defeat. He was fuming following their first-half display, which had left them trailing 2-0 at Goodison Park.",
      "He would make the briefest visit to the dressing room before stepping out. Amorim spent much of the 15 minute break in the corridor outside, looking at the ground. It was Darren Fletcher, the first-team coach at the time, who had to deliver the frank messages of United’s players. They did stage a late comeback to draw 2-2.",

      "One of Ruben Amorim’s first decisions as Manchester United boss didn’t go down well with Rio Ferdinand. It’s a year to the day since Amorim officially started to work at United, having been appointed earlier in the month.",
      "By that point, he had already made the brutal decision to axe club legend Ruud van Nistelrooy from the coaching staff and bring in his own people from Sporting CP. The Dutchman had taken charge of four games on an interim basis following the sacking of Erik ten Hag, winning three and drawing one.",
      "Therefore, many United fans were hoping the former striker would be retained in some capacity. The decision to get rid of Van Nistelrooy drew criticism from Ferdinand, one of the Dutchman’s former United team-mates.",
      "Ferdinand said the move risked alienating players, saying on his Rio Ferdinand Presents YouTube show: “His audition couldn’t have gone any better and I think, knowing him, there was a steely determination underneath that said ‘I’m going to put myself in the best position, either to stay at the club in some capacity or someone else is going to say we need you as a manager.’ He looked the part and he produced.",
      "“The players needed that. We’re in a time where there was a lot of turbulence, the manager’s [Ten Hag’s] relationships with some players seemed fractured and irreversible and the fans seemed to have made their minds up that that was it.",
      "“And the new manager comes in – and you always get that bounce – but this seemed a bit different from a bounce. The players had grown to really like him, they appreciated how he informed them of different bits and pieces – tactically, individually, as a team – and there was a genuine ‘we want to do well for this guy.’”",
      "Another ex-United star, Owen Hargreaves, felt Van Nistelrooy should have been retained to work with attacking players like Rasmus Hojlund, Alejandro Garnacho and Marcus Rashford. He said: “They need to learn from one of the best to ever do it. You don’t have to be the main guy, the coach, but he can help these guys learn the little details.”",
      "Ferdinand agreed, adding: “We’ve been sitting here waiting for a manager to connect with the players. We have one right now. Why are you going to get rid of him? The biggest sticking point and question mark will be the manager. It’ll be his decision to decide whether he keeps Ruud or not.",
      "“It’s a hard decision, because you’re going to need a massive personality and character and confidence in what you do to say ‘I don’t care who’s next to me, I can do this. You’ve got to work out if he’s going to be added value or a distraction.”",
      "While it has been a rough ride for Amorim, who was clinging to his job prior to October’s international break, he hasn’t been afraid to make big and potentially unpopular decisions. Hojlund, Rashford and Garnacho, amongst others, have all been moved on after not fitting into his plans. And following a torrid start to the season, there were signs of progress prior to the current international break.",
      "Van Nistelrooy was soon back in work, joining struggling Leicester City as manager, only to leave after failing to keep the Foxes in the Premier League.",

      "Manchester United have safeguarded themselves with a clause in the event that Chelsea decide to sell Alejandro Garnacho. The Argentine had a bit of a rocky start to his new season with the Blues, spending two of the first five matches across all competitions on the bench and only getting a starting spot against Lincoln in the Carabao Cup.",
      "However, the 21-year-old seems to be hitting his stride recently having become Enzo Maresca's first-choice left winger. Under his guidance, Garnacho has netted two goals and provided two assists in his last four appearances.",
      "Following his strike in the defeat to Sunderland, Garnacho then scored off the bench against Qarabag in the Champions League. The 21-year-old carried his good form into last weekend's win against Wolves as he assisted goals for both Malo Gusto and Pedro Neto.",
      "While this will undoubtedly bring a smile to the Chelsea head coach's face, United supporters might be worried that their club has once again let go of a player who could flourish elsewhere. But it appears United were savvy to the situation, particularly given Chelsea's current transfer strategy.",
      "The Blues are renowned for snapping up young talents on long-term contracts with that further evidenced by Garnacho's deal running until 2032. The goal is to cultivate a youthful squad and, when the moment is right, offload players at a profit after nurturing their careers.",
      "The best example of that is the decision to sell Noni Madueke to Arsenal with Chelsea going close to earning double what they paid. United clearly had Chelsea's tactics in mind, as they included a 10 per cent sell-on clause in Garnacho's contract.",
      "This means that if Chelsea were to move him on for double the £40million paid to sign him, Ruben Amorim's side would pocket £8m from the sale. Garnacho l bid farewell to Old Trafford following a public spat with Amorim over his limited game time in the Europa League final.",
      "He stated: \"Up until the final I played every round helping the team, and today I play 20 minutes, I don't know. The final will influence [my decision] but the whole season, the situation of the club. I'm going to try to enjoy the summer and see what happens afterwards.\"",
      "Now looking for a new beginning at Chelsea, Garnacho is keen to prove Amorim wrong. United, meanwhile, will likely be satisfied if their sell-on clause eventually proves fruitful.",

      "Rio Ferdinand has heaped praise on Manchester United's in-form forward Bryan Mbeumo - labelling the £71million star \"a joke\".",
      "Signed in the summer from Brentford, the Cameroon international has stepped up to the plate for United since his big-money move to Old Trafford, emerging as the chief goal threat in Ruben Amorim's expensively-assembled new look attack. While Benjamin Sesko has taken time to settle and Matheus Cunha has impressed with his all-round game and work ethic, Mbeumo has registered six goals and an assist in his opening 12 games. He was named the Premier League's player of the month for October, at a time where United have gone five games unbeaten in all competitions.",
      "Former United defender Ferdinand was asked to name the club’s most important player right now on his YouTube podcast and was quick to highlight how impressed he has been with the 26-year-old.",
      "\"Mbeumo has been a joke,\" said Ferdinand. \"He’s really stepped in there and become a mainstay. He’s someone who can give you two or three seconds on the ball to relieve pressure. He can score important goals and create chances.",
      "\"I saw Thomas Frank’s comments about him the other day and Mbeumo nearly being a complete winger.",
      "\"I think by the end of this season, he’ll be one of the most complete wingers in the Premier League because he can do everything. He just needs to consistently do it in a United shirt.\"",
      "Mbeumo was not the only player Ferdinand praised, with both Matthijs de Ligt and new goalkeeper Senne Lammens having impressed the ex-England centre-back.",
      "\"You can’t talk about anyone being our most important player without mentioning the goalkeeper,\" added Ferdinand. \"It’s no coincidence we’ve had an upturn in form. We’ve got a goalkeeper that it seems all the players trust.\"",
      "On the subject of De Ligt, who was at United last term but after issues with form and fitness has been an ever-present this term, playing every minute thus far, Ferdinand added: \"I think Matthijs de Ligt has been our best defender this season, he’s been outstanding for us.",
      "\"He’s even adding goals – with the last-minute one the other day [against Tottenham].",
      "\"His pressing, his assertiveness and his willingness to go into foreign areas up the pitch to defend at the right times has been good. Clearing out of the box, he has been brilliant.\"",

      "Sesko failed to fire at the City Ground and Neville said that he looked \"miles off it\" compared to Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha, who have hit the ground running since their arrivals.",
      "Ruben Amorim was asked about the criticism at his press conference last week. He responded: \"Of course, nobody likes to hear, but he struggled a little bit, and that is a fact.",
      "\"So let's embrace that. It’s not personal, it’s not nothing. That is what I try to explain to the players. That is not personal. It's an opinion that is going to change in three weeks.",
      "\"Everything that is true today, in three weeks, could be a lie. So of course, it's hard to hear, but my advice to Ben is you are going to get used. And then it's going to be natural. We are going to help him and we are going to protect Ben because he works really hard and we want to succeed. So he's going to succeed.\"",
      "Amorim handled the question brilliantly, but Sesko would have benefited from a goal when he came on from the bench against Tottenham last weekend.",
      "Sesko was named on the bench, with Amorim reverting to the striker-less front three. He was introduced in the 58th minute and missed two good half-chances before being forced off with a knee injury.",
      "Amorim appeared to be concerned that the issue could be serious. Sesko will miss international duty with Slovenia, but the problem is not thought to be major and he will continue to be assessed.",
      "Sesko should have scored in the passage of play that led to his injury as he wanted too long on the ball and provided an opening for Micky van de Ven to recover with a brilliant tackle.",
      "Although Sesko might have got that half-second extra when he played in the Bundesliga, he won't get that in the Premier League. He should have pulled the trigger immediately or taken the ball inside, which would have positioned his body in front of the defender.",
      "It was a big moment in the game. Tottenham had just equalised and Sesko could have scored to restore United's advantage, but Van de Ven recovered and Spurs scored to make it 2-1.",
      "Alan Shearer, the leading goalscorer in Premier League history, is one of the best pundits in the business, and he's especially good value when analysing strikers on Match of the Day.",
      "Shearer delved into Sesko's appearance from the bench during his analysis segment, saying: \"Sesko struggled again. He's only scored twice in his 12 appearances and he came on today with just over half an hour to go.",
      "\"He had two really, really good chances and should have scored, to be honest. They worked it really well for him to get in the first time. He's either got to get his shot away early or he's got to push that ball forward quicker. He's not going to get that amount of time in the Premier League to work it back on his right foot.\"",
      "He continued: \"This one [the 86th-minute chance] is the bigger puzzle for me. I know he's struggling for confidence but any centre-forward knows you cannot allow the centre-half to come back at you.",
      "\"You've got to get across Van de Ven. By that time he should have a picture in his head of where the keeper is and what he wants to do. I don't think he has a clue what he wants to do because I don't even think he even knows Van de Ven is there and chasing him. I know he's struggling with confidence but it's a big 'must do better'.",
      "\"No one likes to see him coming off injured and we hope his knee is okay, but they are two chances you'd expect at that level that someone has to put away.\"",
      "The positive is that Sesko will learn from his appearance at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium. He is still only 22 and raw, so he was bound to need time to find his feet during his first season in England.",
      "In a dream world, Sesko would have been signed alongside a more experienced centre-forward, or Rasmus Hojlund would have been kept to share the burden of finding the back of the net.",
      "United were convinced Sesko was the right option in the summer transfer window. He had scored the most goals of any player under the age of 23 in Europe's top five leagues over the past two seasons and arrived with the potential to eventually become a 20-goal-per-season striker in the Premier League.",
      "Sesko started on the bench for the opening three Premier League games of the season. He made his debut against Manchester City in September and notched his first goal against Brentford.",
      "The forward built on that by scoring against Sunderland to secure a 2-0 victory last month, finishing at the Stretford End with a clever flick, but he drew a blank in the next four matches.",
      "Sesko should have scored more than two. The standards at United should be high, but the club must play the cards in front of them, which means supporting Sesko in the coming weeks.",
      "Amorim is \"relaxed\" about Sekso's start at the club because he \"has more potential\" than he first thought. Sesko is understood to be a model professional and reports early for training sessions at Carrington.",
      "Sesko appears too talented not to become a success, but he is certain to receive more scrutiny from pundits until the end of the campaign. That is part of the game and they can be silenced by scoring goals.",

      "Manchester United visited Tottenham last weekend and I made my first visit to their stadium. I'd been repeatedly told it was the best arena in the country and it didn't fall short of that billing.",
      "Although the security staff took their time to admit the press into the media suite, it was worth the wait, as the press facilities and food offerings are second to none in the Premier League.",
      "The press food at Stamford Bridge is excellent, but Tottenham edges their London neighbours. The 12.30pm kick-off meant a full breakfast was on offer and the selection was superb for a media suite.",
      "The press room itself was akin to a luxury hotel reception. There was ample working space, comfortable leather-padded seats and Spurs offer lockers for journalists to store bags.",
      "The walk from the media suite to the press box is sign-posted - you could easily get lost on the way - and the interior of the ground is even more impressive than the exterior.",
      "Tottenham left White Hart Lane in 2016, spent nearly three seasons at Wembley, and moved to their new 61,000-seater venue three years later. Sir Jim Ratcliffe wants to build a new 100,000-seater Old Trafford by 2030 and there are a few lessons to be learned from Tottenham.",
      "The design of the stadium is outstanding. You feel like you're working in a special arena throughout your visit, and architecture firm Populous deserved all the plaudits they received.",
      "From a journalist's perspective, the press box is spacious and well-positioned, offering a good vantage point, while the media auditorium is a superb space for managers to conduct their post-match duties.",
      "Ratcliffe wants the new Old Trafford, set to be designed by Foster + Partners, to be the greatest arena in the world, and they will deliver if the rebuild is anything like Tottenham's home.",
      "Tottenham's stadium was rebuilt 170 yards away from where White Hart Lane stood, which means the feeling of the old ground hasn't been totally lost, and the new Old Trafford will seek to retain that 'feeling'.",
      "The Tottenham Hotspur Stadium is designed to maximise supporter experience and it brings fans closer to the pitch than at any comparable-sized stadium in the United Kingdom.",
      "The distances from the front row to the touchline range from just 4.9 metres to 7.9 metres, and the single-tier South Stand is the largest in the UK with a capacity of 17,500 people.",
      "The steep South Stand is remarkable. It was designed with the hope that it would generate an intimidating atmosphere, but no such noise was produced during the game on Saturday.",
      "Like a lot of big clubs in the Premier League, Spurs have become a tourist attraction, which means there were hundreds of fans with tickets in that stand who did not contribute to the atmosphere.",
      "That is their prerogative and 'tourist fans' are still valued fans, but local Tottenham season ticket holders have argued their South Stand should be a designated area for supporters looking to create noise.",
      "The Stretford End is currently that stand within Old Trafford, and United should consider introducing a designated singing section to ensure an atmosphere can be created in the new 100,000-seater stadium.",
      "I was fortunate enough to visit White Hart Lane before it was demolished. It was an ageing ground and Spurs were right to move on, but it could be intimidating for the opposition.",
      "The Tottenham Hotspur stadium is not intimidating. It feels welcoming. United need to ensure they don't fall into the same trap.",

      "Even the most optimistic Manchester United fan would have struggled to make a decent case for extending Casemiro's contract beyond 2026 last season.",
      "The five-time Champions League winner reserved his best performances for the Europa League in 2024/25, with his Premier League showings not good enough for a team of United's stature.",
      "With no European football on offer this season it seemed the Brazilian would be on the fringes of first-team action, but three months into the campaign and he's one of the first names on the team sheet.",
      "Casemiro's contract expires next summer, though United could trigger the clause in his deal to add an additional 12 months onto his Old Trafford stay. With United expected to target a central midfielder next summer and Casemiro turning 34 in February, it might seem silly to do so. But he's still showing he can add value to the squad and could prove to be an invaluable mentor for any new recruit.",
      "So what should United do? Our writers have had their say:",
      "Casemiro has been hugely important this season. United are weaker when he is not on the pitch, which was highlighted again last weekend when he was replaced by Manuel Ugarte.",
      "Wilson Odobert breezed past Ugarte and Tottenham scored an equaliser. Casemiro's strong performances have sparked a conversation about his contract situation, but I believe he should be allowed to leave in the summer on a free transfer, regardless of how important he continues to be this season.",
      "United must take a long-term view and it's not logical to extend Casemiro's contract when he's in the winter of his career, so this season should be his swansong in Manchester.",
      "The fact that there is even a conversation among some fans about extending Casemiro's deal is a credit to him, but United should allow him to leave in the summer and sign a replacement.",
      "Casemiro will be 34 in February. How long he can keep up this level of performance is up for debate, and that's without mentioning he is the highest earner in the dressing room.",
      "The end of the season is an opportunity to move on from Casemiro and it should be taken. The Brazilian can leave the club with his head held high if he bows out by helping to secure Champions League qualification.",
      "Gary Neville and Jamie Carragher seldom pull punches but even by their hard-hitting standards, a couple of remarks about Casemiro were genuine haymakers.",
      "“I think he (Erik ten Hag) oversaw two of the worst transfers Manchester United will ever have made in the signings of Casemiro and Antony,” Neville once said.",
      "Well, Casemiro has not only survived the verbal blows, he has produced a few performances that suggest reports of his demise have been greatly exaggerated. Everyone knows this season’s most telling Casemiro statistic - five goals conceded when he has been on the pitch, 15 when he has been off it.",
      "He also has three goals, one assist and tops the tackle chart with 22. In short, he is proving a very valuable asset for Ruben Amorim.",
      "United should keep him for another season. If that means activating a clause which keeps him on the same extravagant wages, then fine.",
      "It’s a big club. Act big. Amorim will be desperate for a younger, more athletic, more dynamic defensive midfielder, but he will also need experienced alternatives and back-up. If that costs a few more quid than you would like, so be it.",
      "Football has not left Casemiro… and he should not be leaving Old Trafford.",
      "United will sign a central midfielder next summer and so there isn't much of a case to be made for keeping Casemiro for his influence on the pitch. However, having somebody with his experience around the club would be a massive help for whoever United decide to sign.",
      "Manuel Ugarte has done little this season to suggest he can help a new signing bed in, and so Casemiro should be kept at Old Trafford. That being said, it would have to be on reduced terms. United cannot afford to have such a high earner on the books purely for the experience he brings, and so a compromise on his salary would need to be reached.",
      "There's no escaping the fact United look a much better side when Casemiro is in the team. Full credit goes to the Brazilian for turning the public perception of him around.",
      "Should he stay beyond this season? Yes, but only on the right terms. United cannot afford for Casemiro to be one of the highest earners at the club.",
      "He has proven this season that he can play this system and be a good option for Amorim. Should he stay, United still can't avoid the midfield issue for another summer - they must sign a new first choice defensive midfielder and allow Casemiro to be the back-up.",

      "Casemiro's deal at Old Trafford expires in June but United have a 12-month extension option.",
      "The 33-year-old has become an important player for club and country again, starting nine games in the Premier League and forcing his way back into Brazil's starting team under Carlo Ancelotti.",
      "However, Casemiro is the highest earner in the United dressing room and there is an ongoing conversation among supporters about whether he merits a contract extension.",
      "The Brazilian has reported for international duty and sat down for an interview with O Globo, in which he was asked about his plans for the future after June.",
      "Casemiro responded: \"Football is my life, right? So it's inevitable [to continue]. But I think my wife and family will want some time for themselves, yes. I'm one of those who think that in life you have to have a plan.",
      "\"But I'm into short-term goals. Of course, it's inevitable to think about being in good shape for a World Cup, but you can't expect to be in good shape for the World Cup if you're not doing well at Manchester United.",
      "\"For the next call-up, I have to be in good shape. I think day by day: tomorrow I have a good training session, at the weekend I have to play a great game, and so on.\"",
      "Speaking ahead of Tottenham, Amorim was asked about Casemiro's contract situation and he said: \"Yeah, we don't know what is going to happen. My goal is to continue to count with Casemiro, with Harry Maguire, that he has the same problem. I don't know what is going to happen.",
      "\"Let's focus on this season. I'm really happy with Casemiro, he is really important. I'm really happy with Harry, but I know what you guys are asking, let's focus on this season and then we'll see the next season.\"",
      "Casemiro also discussed Brazil's national team ahead of the World Cup, saying: \"I think we will arrive very strong. I think we are still a little behind in terms of time [of work].",
      "\"Especially if you look at the number of days the coach [Ancelotti] has been working. It's not the same as other national teams, which have different cycles, right? If you analyse it in days, we're talking about 30 to 40 days with him.",
      "\"But I think we've arrived at a good moment because we have quality players, we have high-level players, and I think that, along with the coach and his experience in football, is also a very important factor. He's a guy who manages to unite the group, not just the players, but everyone on the staff.\"",

      "Hello and welcome to our Manchester United transfer live blog on Tuesday, November 11.",
      "Having not lost since late September, United head into the latest international break on a high especially after their late fightback against Tottenham. One negative from the 2-2 draw was the early departure of Benjamin Sesko.",
      "He has since dominated headlines with both positive and concerning injury updates emerging on his condition.",
      "Another United striker in Rasmus Hojlund has endured a difficult last few weeks with a return to Old Trafford hinted at. Elsewhere, United continue to be linked to several midfielders ahead of the January transfer window.",
      "The likes of Carlos Baleba, Adam Wharton and Elliot Anderson are all serious options Prior to interest in all three, a move for Amadou Onana was formally made before he ultimately joined Aston Villa.",
      "With all of that being said, follow along below for all the latest United transfer news, rumours and updates.",
      "Rio Ferdinand has issued a clear verdict on Manchester United star Bryan Mbeumo after an imprressive start to life at Old Trafford.",
      "United signed Mbeumo from Brentford during the summer transfer window, and Ferdinand has now praised the forward after impressing during the early months of his career with the Reds.",
      "Tyrell Malacia has been given the support of his Manchester United teammates after being reintegrated to Ruben Amorim's squad.",
      "Malacia had expressed a desire to leave United during the summer transfer window, but the left-back has recently been part of first-team training once again and was in the matchday squad for the win over Brighton last month.",
      "Former Manchester United manager Erik ten Hag is still without a job after leeaving Bayer Leverkusen, and reportedly has already had the chance to return to management.",
      "Ten Hag was linked with the Wolves manager's job before Rob Edwards emerged as the early favourite, and has also been mentioned as potentially returning to Ajax.",
      "However, it seems that Ten Hag will not return to the Netherlands despite recent rumours.",
      "Manchester United are now on a two-week hiatus with the November international break in full swing.",
      "However, for some members of Ruben Amorim's squad, raher than link up with their compatriots on international duty, will instead remain at Carrington to work on their fitness and individual training ahead of the return of Premier League football.",
      "Senne Lammes has been praised by former Manchester United goalkeeper Ben Foster following his recent run of performances.",
      "Foster believes that United's recent upturn in form and performances can partically be attributed to Lammens' qualities between the posts.",
      "\"I didn't know what to expect at the beginning. It's a massive step up and you need somebody with a bit of authority and a bit of an aura about them to step into that Manchester United team,\" Foster said on talkSPORT.",
      "\"But he's done it so far with absolute ease and he's got this confidence about him. He's coming out for balls into the box, where you're normally talking about seriously seasoned Premier League goalies that do this kind of stuff and he's doing it from the get-go.",
      "\"It still remains to be seen whether he's got the X factor and the little bits that turn a good goalie into a great goalkeeper. Whether Senne Lammens has that in his game remains to be seen.\"",
      "Manchester United have reportedly approached Nottingham Forest regarding the possible signing of Elliot Anderson, as the midfielder continues to draw attention from top-tier clubs.",
      "Anderson has been a standout performer for the Midlands club since his transfer from Newcastle in 2024, and his impressive displays at the City Ground have earned him a spot in the national team ahead of next year's World Cup. Unfortunately for Forest, Anderson's excellent form has also caught the eye of some of their domestic competitors.",
      "Read more here",
      "However, it is said that the major obstacle in bringing him back to English football is the finances involved in a potential deal. He is on high wages in Saudi Arabia and has a contract that still runs until 2028.",
      "The 29-year-old has scored 41 goals in 59 appearances for his current side.",
      "Former Manchester United striker Louis Saha has dismissed the notion that £28million is a bargain price for Barcelona to sign Marcus Rashford.",
      "The England star was shipped out to Catalonia on a season-long loan after being deemed surplus to requirements by Reds' boss Ruben Amorim. The Catalan giants have the option to make his move permanent for £28m in 2026, with reports from Sport suggesting they're already working to \"outline an agreement\" with United.",
      "Rashford has impressed so far in Spain with six goals and nine assists across all competitions in a Barcelona shirt. The 28-year-old has the most assists of any player in Europe's top five leagues.",
      "Read more here",
      "Amorim has also acknowledged that the seriousness of Benjamin Sesko's knee problem might affect their strategy.",
      "\"We have to check everything, we have to check what has happened with Ben,\" he said.",
      "\"Of course, we are going to have a problem there [with AFCON], but we already knew. Then you can prepare that in the summer, but then you have a lot of players in the summer who are not going to play because it's one game per week. So the management of that situation is going to be hard.",
      "\"But let's see when the window is open, if we can improve the team and try to prepare something that happened. Until then, we have to take the chance.\"",

      "Manchester United striker Benjamin Sesko was filmed limping out of the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium after Saturday's 2-2 draw in north London.",
      "The Slovenian striker sustained an injury during the game against Spurs after being unable to continue beyond the 85th minute. He had come on just before the hour mark.",
      "Sesko leaving the Tottenham stadium this Saturday with knee injury #ManUnited pic.twitter.com/cxd97LhbkN",
      "Tyrell Malacia received the support of his Manchester United teammates when it came to his reintegration back into the senior squad.",
      "The Dutchmen was joined in Ruben Amorim's 'bomb squad' by Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho, Antony and Alejandro Garnacho. All four of those players have since departed, but Malacia was unable to seal a move.",
      "According to the Athletic, United players spoke in favour of Malacia returning to the fold and Amorim clearly listened as he returned to first-team training and was on the bench for the 4-2 Premier League win against Brighton a few weeks ago.",
      "Manchester United legend Wayne Rooney has delivered a clear Benjamin Sesko verdict when speaking on the latest episode of The Overlap Fan Debate.",
      "He's going through a bit of a tough time in terms of goals scored. I think the goalkeeper has come in and done well, he's been more direct in to Sesko but what we are seeing now is he can compete, he does hold the ball up better than Hojlund does.",
      "We are seeing as the ball is going up to him, Mbeumo, Cunha, Mount making runs in behind.",
      "Because they know he will compete and he will win flick-ons and he will do that, so I think he has been better than what people (are) maybe suggesting but I still think he needs to just get the ball, get hold of it, lay it off and get in the box and hope that the chances are created for him.",
      "I think he has been OK and will come good.",
      "Alejandro Garnacho delivered his best performance in a Chelsea shirt during their 3-0 win over Wolves.",
      "The Argentine assisted Malo Gusto and Pedro Neto as he gave both Santiago Bueno and Jackson Tchatchoua a torrid time on the left.",
      "While things did not work out at Old Trafford, United were firmly aware of his ability as the club inserted a 10% sell-on clause in Garnacho’s move to Stamford Bridge.",
      "This at least protects United in the future to some degree if he does depart the Blues for big money which is entirely possible given how frequently Chelsea sell on their assets.",
      "Senne Lammens could make his debut for Belgium's senior team over the November international break.",
      "Real Madrid's Thibaut Courtois is the undisputed No.1 but he has suffered an injury which will see him remain in Spain for the November international break.",
      "Lammens now looks set to be competing with Matz Sels for the gloves and if it is based on merit, Lammens should be given the nod with the Nottingham Forest goalkeeper having made a number of mistakes so far this season.",
      "Nottingham Forest star Elliot Anderson is one of many high-profile midfielders of interest to Manchester United.",
      "The former Newcastle United man scored his first goal of the season in the 3-1 win over Leeds United this past weekend alongside another dominant display in the engine room. Anderson has been exceptionally consistent this season which has allowed him to break into the England team.",
      "That update suggests that some form of talks have been held whether that be internally, with Forest or to Anderson's camp.",
      "During this difficult spell for Napoli, Antonio Conte has made his feelings on Rasmus Hojlund clear.",
      "Following the 2-0 defeat to Bologna, which was the fourth consecutive game without a goal for Hojlund, Conte was asked directly about the Manchester United loannee's display.",
      "He said to DAZN, via Tutto Mercato Web: \"I didn't mind today, he was perhaps the best player on the pitch. He held his ground and fought. It's inevitable that we had some things prepared, we should have supported him more. We missed him.\"",
      "The future of Rasmus Hojlund has been another trending topic over the last few days and that is for two reasons.",
      "The first of those arrived in the immediate aftermath of the draw with Tottenham as questions began to be asked on whether or not he could be recalled from a loan spell at Napoli following Benjamin Sesko's injury.",
      "However, the only clause included in his temporary switch was a buy-option with the Denmark international set to remain in Naples for the remainder of the campaign.",
      "This past Sunday, Napoli were beaten by Bologna. It was also the third consecutive game they have not scored.",
      "Head coach Antonio Conte went on quite the rant afterwards with it later noted crisis talks were set to be held over his future at the club.",
      "This arrived after Conte appeared to publicly criticise Napoli's summer transfer business. \"Last year, we won an extraordinary and incredible championship, where everyone pushed their limits with great unity and unity across the board.",
      "\"This year, however, between playing so many games and bringing in so many players.",
      "\"In my opinion, nine new players were too many. We weren't balanced. I've always said this year would be difficult; there are some aspects that need to be absorbed over time.\"",
      "Speaking to Sport Witness, Amadou Onana's agent, Melissa Onana, confirmed that Manchester United made a transfer approach for the midfielder when he was at Everton, but just before he joined Aston Villa",
      "Aston Villa’s sporting project was crystal clear. It was a project where Amadou could continue to develop. We spoke with the sporting director, and the salary was also attractive, let’s not kid ourselves.",
      "The Euros were coming up, Amadou was performing well, and we finalised the deal. Then, Manchester United entered the picture. But I had already given my word to Aston Villa.",
      "We knew very well that Manchester would be able to offer better financial terms, but we had already given our word to Aston Villa, and the project was a good fit. The style of football played, the club’s ambition: Amadou felt right at home there.",
      "Benjamin Sesko's knee injury has been the main discussion point for Manchester United over the last 72 hours or so.",
      "The 22-year-old was forced off this past weekend with a knee issue and was later filmed hobbling as he left the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium. Sesko is set to remain at Carrington over the international break to continuing being assessed.",
      "That news did not seemingly reach Slovenia boss Matjaz Kek before his Monday press conference as he stated that the national team had not \"officially received anything yet, no paper, no document\".",
      "He later added: \"The national team is something very special and I expect maximum respect from everyone. Slovenia deserves that, even if there's a superpower like England on the other side, and something as exceptional as the Premier League.\"",
      "Slovenia are set to face Kosovo and Sweden in two potentially important World Cup qualifiers but it looks as though they will have to navigate them without Sesko.",
      "Hello and welcome back to our Manchester United transfer live blog.",
      "For all the latest news and rumours, be sure to follow along as we cover updates on Benjamin Sesko, Rasmus Hojlund, Amadou Onana and much more!",
      "Rasmus Hojlund does not have a recall clause in his Napoli loan contract, according to Fabrizio Romano, as Manchester United consider January striker cover after Benjamin Sesko suffered a knee injury on Saturday.",
      "There has been talk that Hojlund could return to Old Trafford in the winter transfer window following Sesko's injury setback during the 2-2 draw against Tottenham. However, United won't be able to recall the Denmark international, who joined Napoli on a season-long loan in the summer.",
      "Matjaz Kek has claimed that Manchester United have failed to provide an update to the Slovenian national team on Benjamin Sesko's knee injury.",
      "Speaking at a rally in Gorenjska, the Slovenia manager said: \"With all due respect to a big club like Manchester United.",
      "\"We haven't officially received anything yet, no paper, no document. We would definitely like to receive it, we also want the player to be examined by our medical service.",
      "\"Our doctor is an expert in this field, we don't have anyone in this position. I can't comment, of course I have certain information, I'm also in contact with Beni.",
      "\"But I can't say anything because officially we know absolutely nothing, United hasn't contacted anyone from our camp. Of course I'm worried about the player, the only thing I'm interested in is his well-being, we're ready to do everything for that and we've never sent anyone onto the field if there was the slightest risk.",
      "\"But the national team is something very special and I expect maximum respect from everyone. Slovenia deserves that, even if there's a superpower like England on the other side, and something as exceptional as the Premier League.\"",

      "The month will end with another game against Wolves - this time at home. The festive period can make-or-break a season, and Amorim will be desperate for his players to continue their recent momentum.",
      "United are undefeated in their last five matches and will play Everton and Crystal Palace before the end of December, so there is an opportunity for that record to remain intact.",
      "The busier fixture list will pose different challenges, though. Amorim picked an unchanged team for the first time in the Premier League against Brighton and he has settled on regular starters.",
      "Luke Shaw, Bruno Fernandes, Matthijs de Ligt and Bryan Mbeumo have all started every league game this season, while Amad, Mathues Cunha and Casemiro are the next players with the most minutes recorded.",
      "Mbeumo and Amad will travel to the Africa Cup of Nations to represent Cameroon and the Ivory Coast respectively near the end of December, and there are question marks around whether Shaw and Casemiro will be able to deal with the increased workload for different reasons.",
      "United have planned with Amad and Mbeumo going to AFCON in mind, but it would be a blow to lose Shaw to injury, or for Casemiro's performance level to drop, which is possible due to the congested fixture list.",
      "If you ignore the defeat in the Manchester derby, Shaw has enjoyed a strong campaign and was unfortunate not to be recalled to the England squad for the November international break.",
      "He wants to play for his country, although United fans were pleased with Thomas Tuchel's decision given the 30-year-old has benefited from playing one game per week so far this season. Shaw has tended to pick up muscle injuries and little niggles in the past due to playing two matches in seven days, but he has maintained a clean bill of health thanks to the kinder fixture schedule.",
      "You only need to look at Shaw's medical history to conclude that he may end up facing a spell on the sidelines during the winter schedule - more games mean a higher chance of injury.",
      "Shaw has been excellent on the left side of the back three. Lisandro Martinez is set to return imminently from a knee injury, but he will be missed if he picks up an injury this winter.",
      "On the other hand, Casemiro has demonstrated durability and should be able to physically cope with the increased workload, but whether he can maintain his current performance level is another matter.",
      "United have conceded five goals when Casemiro has been on the pitch this season and 15 when he has been off it. The Brazilian has enjoyed an unexpected renaissance during 2025 after falling down the pecking order, but will he be able to sustain those displays playing two games per week?",
      "Casemiro's renaissance was sparked by his performances in the Europa League last term. He was more suited to the pace of the competition, but he struggled when he played in the league.",
      "The 33-year-old has transferred his European form into the Premier League this season but playing two weeks per week in December will pose different questions for him.",
      "Amorim will be hoping Shaw remains fit and Casemiro can sustain his current level. United are guaranteed to lose Mbeumo and Amad, so they could do without another two key players losing their places.",

      "Wayne Rooney has admitted that he regrets not going on the latest season of I'm a Celebrity... Get Me Out of Here, which is set to air this coming Sunday. From footballers, rappers and YouTubers to models, comedians and national treasures, ITV announced the show's official lineup on Monday night.",
      "Shona McGarty, Kelly Brook, Martin Kemp, Eddie Kadi, Alex Scott, Ruby Wax, Jack Osbourne, Lisa Riley, Aitch, and Angry Ginge will feature on the opening weekend of the show's 25th series. It'll be set in New South Wales, Australia, with Ant and Dec hosting 22 episodes.",
      "Rooney spoke to Angry Ginge, a popular social media influencer from Salford, before he entered the jungle. They became friends last year when the YouTuber and Twitch streamer invited the Manchester United legend to play EA FC 24, formerly known as FIFA, with him and his friends online.",
      "Rooney quickly hit it off with Angry Ginge, whose real name is Morgan Burtwistle, and the other social media stars, like Ethan Payne from the Sidemen. The Match of the Day pundit also struck up a friendship with Aitch, a rapper from New Moston whose real name is Harrison Armstrong, during appearances for 'Girth N Turf' – their FC 24 pro clubs team.",
      "So, when Rooney discovered that the duo were going into the jungle, he began to regret the decision to not follow suit. The former England international said: \"I spoke to him last night and he was still in England, so I don't know if he is…",
      "\"No, Ginge is a great lad and I've seen who's linked as well, so if he is in there I'm sure he'll be really entertaining. If he's in it and Aitch is in it as well, I'm gutted that I didn't go in because I think the three of us could have been real fun in there.\"",
      "\"I'd be all right with the food situation, but I get bored, and some of the challenges, you know, the snakes and there was one a few years ago with the big ostrich. I wouldn't like that.\"",
      "Coleen Rooney featured on I'm a Celebrity... Get Me Out of Here last year. Wayne added: \"I love the show and obviously Coleen was in it last year and maybe at some point but not this year, unfortunately.\"",
      "Danny Jones was crowned King of the Jungle last year, narrowly winning the public vote. Coleen, who finished second, said: \"Knowing that I have made it to the final makes me proud. I'm a proud mum, I'm a proud wife, I'm a proud daughter.\"",
      "This year, Angry Ginge and Aitch will be looking to make Wayne proud. Speaking to ITV, the former said: \"I’ve watched the show on the sofa with my mum ever since I was a kid. To take part in it this year is something I couldn’t pass up on.",
      "\"But my whole life is spent on the phone. I’ve been away once for a week. And so, two to three weeks without it is going to be very educational to see how I will do.\"",
      "Meanwhile, the latter, whose sister, Gracie, has the genetic disorder, said: \"I feel like I have got this calling to raise awareness for Down syndrome and I feel that’s the perfect place. Also, you don’t always want to be stuck in the same world forever.",
      "\"You can branch out and do other things. You don’t have to stick to the code (rap world), because you think that’s cool. I did have to cancel some gigs for it. But you are never going to branch out if you do the same thing all the time.\"",

      "Manchester United's players spoke in favour of Tyrell Malacia's reintegration to first-team training last month, after the Dutch left-back was part of Ruben Amorim's so-called 'bomb squad'. Malacia was one of five players that informed the Reds of his desire to leave the club in the summer.",
      "The 26-year-old struggled for regular game time after returning from a serious knee injury and spent the second half of last season on loan at PSV. He pushed for a move in the off-season but didn't manage to secure an exit, unlike Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho, Antony and Alejandro Garnacho.",
      "Malacia was the only 'bomb squad' member to remain at United beyond the end of the summer transfer window and Amorim made the decision to get him back involved with the first-team squad. He was pictured back in senior training on October 1 and was named on the bench to face Brighton later that month.",
      "According to The Athletic, United's players were right behind Amorim's decision to reintroduce Malacia into the fold and the club's head coach heeded that feedback by putting him in the squad against Brighton.",
      "Malacia signed for United in a £13million deal from Feyenoord in July 2022, becoming Erik ten Hag's first signing as United boss in the process. He established himself as an integral member of Ten Hag's squad in his debut campaign, making 39 appearances across all competitions and helping the Reds win the Carabao Cup.",
      "However, in the summer of 2023, Malacia underwent knee surgery - a procedure that would end up keeping him out for a year and a half. He made his long-awaited return for the Under-21s in the EFL Trophy in November 2024, and followed that up by featuring in the Europa League clash against Bodo/Glimt later that month.",
      "But Malacia's game time United was sparse, with the defender making the decision to go out on loan and get more minutes for the second half of the 2024/25 season. Indeed, he signed for PSV on loan back in February.",
      "During his time at PSV, he made 11 appearances, featuring against Arsenal twice in the Champions League and helping the club win the Eredivisie title for the second straight season.",
      "Malacia returned to United following the end of his loan spell at PSV in the summer and hasn't played a single minute of competitive football since. He has been named in the United matchday squad once for the visit of Brighton on October 25, but remained as an unused substitute.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "We are nearly a third of the way through the Premier League campaign and as we enter the final international break of 2025, thoughts at Manchester United are starting to turn to business which could be done in the January transfer window.",
      "After the draw at Tottenham, Ruben Amorim alluded in his press conference that United may delve into the market this winter should Benjamin Sesko's injury prove to be serious. It is understood the injury is not too severe albeit the exact timescale of his absence is unknown.",
      "If the Slovenian is back for the festive period, the demand to jump into January and sign a striker is less. However, he remains the only first-team, natural centre-forward at Old Trafford that Amorim is willing to use.",
      "Should Joshua Zirkzee be sold, which is a possibility in January as United brace themselves for a request, the Reds could bank up to £21m based on Transfermarkt's valuation, which could boost their budget to sign a striker and help ease the burden on Sesko. With this in mind, MEN Sport has taken a look at four players who they could target to do just that.",
      "Last week, Jason Wilcox spoke about the club's summer transfer business. In the interview on MUTV, the director of football spoke about the need to sign players who could 'plug and play' in the Premier League.",
      "Thiago at Brentford has proven he can do just that in his short time with the Bees. Only Erling Haaland has scored more goals than the Brazilian in the top flight this season.",
      "The 24-year-old is also playing for a side who have struggled at times this campaign, making his record even more impressive. However, he did only sign from Club Brugge in the summer and Brentford can therefore name their price.",
      "United already know that the Bees are tough negotiators, as proven with Bryan Mbeumo.",
      "Vlahovic's time at Juventus could be coming to an end very soon. The Serbian is out of contract in 2026 meaning United could move for him on a free in January.",
      "Juventus find themselves in a difficult position and if they feel they cannot convince the 25-year-old to sign fresh terms, they will look to sell him in January rather than lose him for nothing. This puts United on the front foot in negotiations but they are not believed to be alone in their pursuit of Vlahovic.",
      "PSG, Tottenham and Bayern Munich are all being linked with the forward, who has scored six goals in 15 appearances.",
      "Rumour has it that Toney is looking to move back to the Premier League in January from Al Ahli. While the riches of the Saudi Pro League are a huge incentive for players, they come at a cost.",
      "Despite 11 goals in 15 appearances this season, Toney is unlikely to get a World Cup call-up without replicating that form in Europe. Thomas Tuchel has only called up one recognised striker for the November international break although Marcus Rashford can fill in, if required.",
      "So Toney returning to the Premier League would not only revitalise his hopes of going to the World Cup, but would provide his next club with a player on a mission. Before moving to Al Ahli, the 29-year-old was linked with a move to the Reds.",
      "His last full season in the Premier League saw him score 20 goals in 33 appearances so he clearly can score in the top flight. He would be a less risky signing than the two men above, but his price tag will be a deciding factor.",
      "Mateta scored 14 goals in the Premier League last season for Crystal Palace and is the target man a lot of clubs would love to have - including United.",
      "His six in 11 matches this term shows that Mateta is no flash in the pan either. At 28, he is a more experienced head too which would help Sesko.",
      "The trouble with Mateta is the price which Oliver Glasner would demand for a player of his quality. He already knows he is losing Marc Guehi on a free in the summer so United may be priced out in January.",
      "But, if they can sign him, what an addition he would be to United's attack.",

      "United had to finish the game with 10 men because Amorim had used all of his substitutions.",
      "Sesko will continue to be assessed at Carrington this week, but sources have indicated the injury is not thought to be a major issue.",

      "When asked whether it was serious, Amorim said: \"I have no idea. Because it's the knee, we never know.\"",
      "United signed Sesko for €76.5million (£66.4m) plus €8.5m (£7.3m) in add-ons in the summer. The 22-year-old started on the bench for the opening three Premier League games of the season. He made his debut against Manchester City in September and notched his first goal against Brentford.",
      "Sesko built on that by scoring against Sunderland to secure a 2-0 victory last month. However, he was benched against Liverpool at Anfield and failed to score in the next three matches.",

      "Senne Lammens has been told his 'authority and aura' have helped him cement his position as Manchester United's number one goalkeeper.",
      "Questions were originally asked when the young Belgian keeper was brought in from Royal Antwerp in an £18.2million transfer on deadline day on September 1. The 23-year-old was considered a relative unknown by some pundits upon his arrival at Old Trafford, having yet to earn his first senior international cap for Belgium.",
      "However, Andre Onana entered the season with significant question marks surrounding him whilst Altay Bayindir had similarly failed to impress. Following a series of costly mistakes from Onana that resulted in his loan move to Turkish side Trabzonspor, United head coach Ruben Amorim quickly looked to Lammens.",
      "He has grasped the chance firmly, recording a clean sheet in his first appearance against Sunderland and helping United maintain an undefeated run across their last five fixtures. Ex-United and Wrexham shot-stopper Ben Foster reckons that improvement in results can be partially credited to the assurance shown by Lammens in goal.",
      "His self-belief in his own capabilities presents a marked difference to Onana, who seemed stripped of confidence by the time of his departure.",
      "Speaking about Lammens' displays on talkSPORT, Foster said: \"I didn't know what to expect at the beginning. It's a massive step up and you need somebody with a bit of authority and a bit of an aura about them to step into that Manchester United team.",
      "\"But he's done it so far with absolute ease and he's got this confidence about him. He's coming out for balls into the box, where you're normally talking about seriously seasoned Premier League goalies that do this kind of stuff and he's doing it from the get-go.",
      "\"It still remains to be seen whether he's got the X factor and the little bits that turn a good goalie into a great goalkeeper. Whether Senne Lammens has that in his game remains to be seen.\"",
      "Foster was initially sceptical about Lammens' arrival after previously suggesting it would require a \"miracle\" for the signing to prove worthwhile. However, he has now changed his stance following the keeper's composed performances between the sticks.",
      "United legend Rio Ferdinand has also praised Lammens' impact, with Amorim's men currently sitting seventh in the Premier League following their dramatic 2-2 draw at Tottenham on Saturday.",
      "Speaking on his YouTube channel, he said: \"You can't talk about anyone being our most important player without mentioning the goalkeeper. It's no coincidence we've had an upturn in form. We've got a goalkeeper that it seems all the players trust.\"",
      "Lammens was recently labelled as \"boring\" by some United supporters on social media as a compliment after he appeared for Belgium international duty wearing beige attire. It's a description the goalkeeper himself is more than willing to accept as he strives to establish a reputation for reliability.",
      "\"I understand I might come across as 'boring' but that's the goalkeeper I want to be,\" he told Belgian publication HLN. \"I don't do anything crazy. In recent years, players have come through here who...weren't boring. But I want to stand for consistency. Staying calm, in good times and bad.",
      "\"If you want a successful career, you have to have that quality, I think. I saw that in Simon Mignolet (at Club Brugge) and Jean Butez (at Antwerp). They were my role models. I was able to steal from them with my eyes.\"",

      "Alongside his corner being headed home by the Poland international to complete a hat-trick, Rashford created two big chances on the left. Lewandowski guided home his first cross into the box with Lamine Yamal benefiting from another of Rashford's passes.",
      "The latter did not count as a direct goal contribution with an attempted interception taking the ball into Yamal's path. Despite his influential role, Rashford missed some good chances to score and he also picked up a second yellow card of the season.",
      "That booking was not because of a bad foul though, with Rashford shown a caution for time-wasting when he slowly departed the pitch after being subbed off for Ferran Torres in the 88th minute.",
      "While it was likely done to run the clock down, Rashford's decision to slowly trudge off may have been done as he was taking in the applause with the travelling contingent all standing to clap his performance.",

      "Manchester United rescued a 2-2 draw against Tottenham Hotspur on Saturday lunchtime.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo opened the scoring with an impressive header in the first half. Up until the last six minutes, the Reds looked like they were going to win the game but Mathys Tel's deflected strike and Richarlison's header put them on the brink of defeat.",
      "Matthijs de Ligt's late header rescued a point as United made it five games unbeaten in the Premier League.",
      "MEN Sport has taken a look at some of the moments you might have missed from the game:",
      "Spurs' reminder",
      "There's no forgetting what happened back in May when United faced Tottenham - and Spurs are making sure of it. Walking on the High Road side of the stadium, you pass one of the main receptions. Peak inside and the Europa League trophy is on full display with fans at 9am queuing for photos with it.",
      "It took the home supporters less than three minutes to chant ‘Champions of Europe, we know what we are’. That returned in added time before De Ligt silenced them.",
      "United defensive fluidity",
      "United were at their fluid best in the first half. When Spurs were in possession, United dropped into a back four with Luke Shaw pushing into a central midfield position.",
      "But he was not the only one to move positions. Harry Maguire found himself on the wing trying to cross into the box and at one stage Patrick Dorgu was almost in a centre-forward role as Bryan Mbeumo covered at wing-back.",
      "Fluidity is clearly what Amorim wants to see moving forward.",
      "Set-piece instructions",
      "Set-piece coach Carlos Fernandes was often on the edge of the technical area in the first half. Shortly before the break, you could see him barking instructions to United's defenders and he was clearly unhappy with one player's position as he flagged down Amorim to have a word.",
      "But Fernandes doesn't just dish out criticism. He was full of praise for De Ligt after one clearance and he will have been delighted to see the centre-back score from a corner at the death.",
      "Amorim’s Mbeumo instruction",
      "Not that he needs much encouragement but Amorim was keen to ensure that Mbeumo's levels did not drop against Spurs. He was quick to urge him to make forward runs whenever Amad had the ball.",
      "United looked at their most dangerous when they were playing direct down the flanks.",
      "Amorim warning before goal",
      "In the second half, Amorim sent a warning to his defence when they were leading 1-0 to ensure they stepped up. On this occasion it was Patrick Dorgu who had dropped too deep and he quickly moved up the pitch to ensure he was in line with his teammates.",
      "For Richarlison's late goal, Manuel Ugarte did not step up quickly enough to catch him out. When he watches the goal back Amorim will be furious.",

      "Bryan Mbeumo continued his hot streak by opening the scoring in the 32nd minute. Amad was responsible for the brilliant assist and United saw their one-goal advantage into the interval.",
      "Tottenham pushed for an equaliser at the beginning of the second half. They have struggled at home this season, but they finally found a breakthrough thanks to Mathys Tel. Richarlison thought he had secured the win in stoppage time but Matthijs de Ligt struck in the 96th minute to grab a point for United.",
      "Here are how United's players rated in London:",
      "Senne Lammens",
      "Wasn't switched on at the start of the game but focused his mind in the first half and started the second half by making two superb saves. Couldn't stop either of Tottenham's goals. 6",
      "Harry Maguire",
      "Looked pumped from the first whistle, running over to the away section and applauding. He performed well in the centre of the back three and made important interceptions. 5",
      "Matthijs de Ligt",
      "Netherlands manager Ronald Koeman has recalled Matthijs de Ligt to the national side for the upcoming international break. De Ligt deserved that recall, but was at fault for the equaliser. Then redeemed himself with a heroic header. 6",
      "Luke Shaw",
      "Stepped into the midfield at times which meant the shape sometimes looked like a back four. Shaw played ok, but was on the pitch for the late collapse. 5",
      "Noussair Mazraoui",
      "Pressed aggressively which earned him applause from Amorim. It didn't feel fair to bring him off in the 59th minute when Patrick Dorgu seemed the logical change. 6",
      "Casemiro",
      "Started the game by playing a few loose passes and couldn't help United see out the victory. 5",
      "Bruno Fernandes",
      "Was not at his best in the centre of the pitch. Looked sluggish and wasn't combative enough against Spurs' midfielders. Played the corner into the box for De Ligt's goal. 5",
      "Patrick Dorgu",
      "Struggled in moments during the first half. He replaced Diogo Dalot in the starting team, but still looks raw and unconvincing. His final ball around the box must improve. 4",
      "Bryan Mbeumo",
      "Unplayable at times. Finished brilliantly to open the scoring and now has four goals in his last four games. 8",
      "Amad",
      "Got in the way of Matheus Cunha which denied his teammate a chance on goal, but played a clever cross into the box for Mbeumo's goal. Later moved to right wing-back. 6",
      "Matheus Cunha",
      "Was the same as Fernandes - not at his best against Tottenham. Was booked at the start of the second half for kicking the ball away. 5",
      "Benjamin Sesko",
      "A couple of half chances not taken. 4",
      "Manuel Ugarte",
      "Allowed Pape Sarr to run past him for Tottenham's goal. Weak. 2",
      "Mason Mount",
      "Tried his best. 6",
      "Leny Yoro",
      "Did ok after slotting in. 5",
      "Diogo Dalot",
      "His first touch was heavy. 4",

      "Ruben Amorim confirmed Manchester United could consider strengthening their attacking options in January, depending on the severity of the injury Benjamin Sesko suffered against Tottenham.",
      "Sesko was introduced from the bench in the 58th minute at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, but he lasted just half an hour and was forced off the pitch after receiving treatment for a knee injury.",
      "United had to finish the game with 10 men because Amorim had used all of his substitutions.",
      "Amorim was asked about the striker's injury at his post-match press conference following the 2-2 draw. \"We have to check. He had something in his knee, let's see,\" he said.",
      "When asked whether it was serious, Amorim said: \"I have no idea. Because it's the knee, we never know.\"",
      "Sesko failed to pull the trigger twice when he was presented with two half chances against Spurs, but Amorim believes a lack of confidence wasn't to blame. He said: \"No, I think... I think that is not the biggest concern now.",
      "\"That happened in the same way that he is not scoring and then he scores two goals in the next two games [Brentford and Sunderland], so that happens, especially with a striker. I'm more concerned with an injury because it's in the knee and I don't know. We need Ben to be a better team.\"",
      "United will lose Bryan Mbeumo, Amad and Noussair Mazraoui to the Africa Cup of Nations in December, which prompted Amorim to confirm the club could be active in the January window.",
      "Amorim said the severity of Sesko's knee injury could influence plans. \"We have to check everything, we have to check what has happened with Ben,\" he said.",
      "\"Of course, we are going to have a problem there [with AFCON], but we already knew. Then you can prepare that in the summer, but then you have a lot of players in the summer who are not going to play because it's one game per week. So the management of that situation is going to be hard.",
      "\"But let's see when the window is open, if we can improve the team and try to prepare something that happened. Until then, we have to take the chance.\"",

      "Marcus Rashford has reminded Manchester United what they're missing out on – again. The Barcelona loanee chipped in with a couple of assists as the Spanish champions enjoyed a 4-2 win over Celta Vigo at the Balaidos Stadium on Sunday night.",
      "Robert Lewandowski broke the deadlock inside the opening quarter of an hour, beating Ionut Radu from 12 yards. Sergio Carreira equalised a few moments later, slicing through the heart of Hansi Flick's infamous offside trap.",
      "The veteran striker restored Barcelona's lead later in the first half, latching onto a delightfully weighted cross from Rashford. Celta Vigo pulled one back, again, with Borja Iglesias smashing the ball past Wojciech Szczesny.",
      "Lamine Yamal gave the Catalan outfit some breathing space at the break, finding the net deep into stoppage time. The United star had turned provider again, picking out the Barcelona wonderkid at the back post.",
      "Fanatics has slashed the price of Man United kits and merch with up to 60% off select items.",
      "Lewandowski put the fourth and final nail in the coffin in the second half to complete his hat-trick. With Rayo Vallecano holding Real Madrid to a goalless draw, Flick's side narrowed their rivals' advantage in the title race to just three points.",
      "After the game, Rashford marked the occasion with a celebratory post on Instagram, which chalked up almost half a million likes by Tuesday morning. The England international wrote: \"Important three points away. We keep working TEAM.\"",
      "Among the thousands of fans who liked the post were David De Gea and Bruno Fernandes. Flick was pleased to see an improvement in his side's general play over the weekend. As quoted by ESPN, the Barcelona boss told reporters: \"Yes [I am satisfied].",
      "\"I appreciate a lot what I saw today. At the moment, it's like, especially in the first half, we made some mistakes, more than in the second half, and they use it. Two mistakes for the goals.",
      "\"But what I saw, also in first half, we controlled the game. It was a really good match with the ball, and especially in the second half, we defend much better.",
      "\"I think the second half gives us confidence also for the next matches. This is what we need. When you can make pressure on the opponent it's a good way. We did it. I like what I saw, especially in the second half.\"",
      "Earlier this month, Rashford vowed to improve his overall performance – and he delivered. Speaking to Spanish outlet Mundo Deportivo earlier this month, the 28-year-old said: \"I try to give my best.",
      "\"I could have done better against Elche, and I promise to improve because I'm not entirely happy with my performance overall. We work hard to win. We're taking it one game at a time.",
      "\"We need to keep playing as a team. This is Barca, and the demands must always be at their highest.\"",

      "Marcus Rashford delivered two assists for Barcelona as they secured a comfortable win at Celta Vigo on Sunday. His creative contributions for a rejuvenated Robert Lewandowski continued an impressive spell of form for the Manchester United loanee.",
      "Hansi Flick's team began the weekend trailing La Liga leaders Real Madrid by five points. Yet Barca narrowed the deficit to just three points after Los Blancos were held to a goalless draw against derby opponents Rayo Vallecano earlier on Sunday.",
      "The performance wasn't without its flaws, though, as highlighted by sections of the Spanish press. Nevertheless, the overall response to Rashford's vital pair of assists was favourable as Lewandowski, who secured the three points thanks to his hat-trick, profited significantly from the Englishman's contribution.",
      "Mundo Deportivo was especially emphatic in its praise of the United loanee and labelled him as \"one of the key players in Vigo.\" Beyond his direct goal involvements, his set-piece delivery proved dangerous on the west coast.",
      "\"The English striker improved his pressing performance and delivered three corners that resulted in goals,\" read one passage from the newspaper's coverage. \"Rashford worked hard to press in defence better than in recent matches, outpaced [Oscar] Mingueza and ended up being decisive with three crosses that ended in goals, two to Lewandowski, one of them from a corner, and one that Ilaix [Moriba] deflected and Lamine Yamal finished.\"",
      "The same analysis praised Rashford's \"excellent passing ability\" and explained how crucial his pressing was in disrupting Celta's flow. Meanwhile, El Pais emphasised that Rashford was \"the Barcelona player who is taking on defenders most often when he receives the ball at his feet.\"",
      "The publication also described the Englishman's \"superb\" delivery to Lewandowski for the decisive goal at 2-1. Sergio Carreira's early equaliser kept the contest level for much of the opening period, with Borja Iglesias again restoring parity before half-time.",
      "However, it wasn't entirely positive, as Sport highlighted the attacker's \"unforgivable mistake\" when he squandered a clear one-on-one opportunity against Celta goalkeeper Ionut Radu. That error proved particularly costly at the time as Carreira netted his equaliser immediately from the subsequent Celta breakaway.",
      "\"He [Rashford] had time, space, and every option, but his finish was weak, almost a pass to the goalkeeper,\" read one excerpt. \"The clearest chance of the match evaporated without consequence...or at least, without the desired one.\"",
      "Yet another section of the same publication celebrated Rashford for the contributions that did prove effective. His \"exceptional attacking performance\" was considered especially impressive given Lamine Yamal endured a difficult opening half in Vigo.",
      "Sport's evaluation put the Englishman on a pedestal: \"Rashford was a constant threat from the start of the match. He wasn't clinical with his first scoring opportunity, and in fact, Celta's first equaliser came after the England international squandered a one-on-one with Radu that could have put Barcca 2-0 up.",
      "\"However, this setback didn't faze Marcus, who ended up having a magnificent game and being the originator of three of the team's four goals at Balaidos. His crosses for Lewandowski's second and third goals were impeccable, and the Polish striker made the most of them.\"",
      "Rashford, whose long-term future in Catalonia is still far from certain, enters the international break having registered at least one goal or assist in seven of his previous eight league appearances. England manager Thomas Tuchel will be hoping to see this form continue when the Three Lions face Serbia and Albania in their forthcoming fixtures.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Scott McTominay has urged Napoli to sign Manchester United midfielder Kobbie Mainoo in the January transfer window, with the Scotland international speaking to Antonio Conte about his former teammate.",
      "Mainoo has fallen drastically down the pecking order at Old Trafford under Ruben Amorim. After being a regular last term, the 20-year-old has played just eight games so far this term.",
      "Amorim has preferred Casemiro and Bruno Fernandes in midfield in Premier League games, with Mainoo coming off the bench in seven of the first 10 games. However, he was an unused sub in the 2-2 draw at Nottingham Forest and was left out of the squad entirely against Tottenham, due to a knock.",
      "With United already out of the Carabao Cup and not playing European football, Mainoo's minutes are expected to be limited until the January transfer window, which could place his World Cup hopes in doubt.",
      "A temporary move has been tipped ahead of the reopening of the window, with Napoli strongly linked. Previously, it had been reported that the Italian champions would be willing to pay his full salary to bring him to Naples.",
      "Now, The Sun have reported that McTominay is doing all he can to reunite with Mainoo in Serie A. The 28-year-old left United in 2024 and scored 12 goals in his first season, winning the Scudetto.",
      "Sources have told the outlet that McTominay has informed Conte that he should sanction a move to sign Mainoo. \"Scott has been to see Conte and told him to get Kobbie,\" the source said.",
      "\"He's told him all about his strengths and what an outstanding player he is. He knows all about him from his time at United and thinks he would be a great addition to the squad, whether it's on loan or a permanent deal.",
      "\"Kobbie has been brought up the right way at United having been in the academy since he was a little boy. He would fit straight in and give Napoli a boost.\"",
      "In a recent interview, Amorim admitted there simply isn't room for Mainoo in his squad. \"Every minute we are using to prepare the future with a lot of games and less training,\" Amorim told beIN Sports.",

      "Casemiro made a beeline for Ruud van Nistelrooy in the Old Trafford tunnel on his return with Leicester City in February.",
      "Van Nistelrooy, a fluent Spanish speaker, was the conduit between Casemiro and Erik ten Hag after his Portuguese-speaking assistant Mitchell van der Gaag left. Van Nistelrooy started Casemiro in all four of his matches as caretaker manager. Casemiro lingered as Van Nistelrooy spoke, as attached to him as a comfort blanket.",
      "At that time, Casemiro had not started for United in 39 days. He did not get a kick between December 30, the night of the Newcastle United debacle, and January 30. He emerged on 70 minutes in Bucharest with United 2-0 up. The transfer window was still open but the chances of United shifting Casemiro were, like the Trinity test igniting the atmosphere, near zero.",
      "People at United's Carrington training complex noticed Casemiro's personality never wavered during a trying first half of the season. They have always found him to be a warm presence.",
      "His transformation at United in the past two months has been as unexpected as their 3-0 triumph in Bilbao. This is the midfielder who was dropped for last year's FA Cup final and replaced by Toby Collyer with United 2-0 down to Liverpool at half-time eight months ago. Casemiro’s declaration that he was keen to see out his contract in March was framed as more bad news for the club.",
      "Casemiro used his head before Athletic lost theirs in San Mames. Returning to Spain emboldens Casemiro. In San Sebastián and Bilbao, he has reminded Spanish audiences he can still cut it nearly three years on from leaving their shores. United supporters serenaded Casemiro on Thursday night.",
      "The draw with Real Sociedad in mid-March has marked a late turning point in Casemiro's third season in Manchester. With Manuel Ugarte out injured, Ruben Amorim had little choice but to turn to the older defensive midfielder.",
      "Casemiro has since been a fixture in the United starting XI, his importance highlighted by the early withdrawal at Bournemouth last week to preserve him for Bilbao. Ugarte admitted this week he is copying him.",
      "Within a matter of months, Casemiro has gone from unsellable to undroppable. If or when United reach the Europa League final, Casemiro is a shoo-in in midfield. The 3-4-2-1 system Amorim swears by has closed the yawning gaps that developed between the defence and midfield under Ten Hag and Casemiro has the safety net of a third centre back.",
      "United have adjusted Casemiro’s running and pressing triggers. “I think he has improved a lot also,” Amorim opined. “You can see not the way he plays but the way he runs. You can see it, we have the data to show him where he worked really hard.",
      "“He is a very good example. Even Toby sometimes was playing in front of him and [that] it is hard to take for Casemiro. So it is a lesson for all the players in Manchester United.",
      "“No matter what is the past or the last month, everything can change in one moment. Then we understood that he cannot jump all the time pressing high. We need to let him understand and sometimes it is better to put three defenders and let him be the fourth defender and put the wing-backs pressing high. These are all things we are understanding and trying to cope with all the criticisms of the team. But the credit is for Casemiro.”",
      "Amorim has been impressed by how hard Casemiro has worked to meet his demands to regain his place in the team. He noticed that he never complained during those winter weeks warming the bench.",
      "Selflessness is a natural trait of Casemiro's. It was also his undoing this time last year. With United depleted at centre half, he dropped back and was humiliated in the 4-0 drubbing by Crystal Palace.",
      "With Kobbie Mainoo and Christian Eriksen a flimsy shield and Jonny Evans his creaking partner, Casemiro abandoned his position to engage Michael Olise, overcommitted, lost his balance and Olise scored. Six days later, he trundled out of the United third and played Arsenal winger Gabriel Martinelli onside to square for Leandro Trossard’s tap-in. Sofyan Amrabat was ushered back in from the cold and played his way into the FA Cup final XI.",
      "Jamie Carragher urged Casemiro to “leave the football before the football leaves you”. Casemiro had been pencilled in to flank Amorim for pre-match press duties against Athletic and he would be a worthy choice at Carrington next week. He is a positive story again and one of the squad’s figureheads. United view Casemiro as a quiet leader, mind.",
      "The 33-year-old shared Raphael Varane’s view that a “disconnect” had developed between the players and Ten Hag. It is not a coincidence that Casemiro scored two goals in the first game after Ten Hag was finally sacked. He was committed enough to claim the last goal of the Ten Hag era at West Ham.",
      "When Casemiro discussed the possibility of joining United, he wanted to know three things: where he would live, where he would train and where the stadium was. During FaceTime conversations, he requested to see the club’s gymnasium at Carrington.",
      "United sources have been struck by how leaner Casemiro is this season. People in Madrid said Casemiro used to be in the club's Valdebebas gym at 8am and he often has gym sessions before and after training at Carrington.",
      "Casemiro has struck up a close rapport with some of the masseurs and his English is now a very good level of conversational. He understood our questions in the mixed zone two years ago, when his handshake grip was as tight as a vice. Casemiro's wife, Anna, and children Sara and Caio, are happy in Manchester amid the prospect of a fourth year in England's north west.",
      "Staff at Carrington regard Casemiro as one of the most respectful players they have encountered and that he is strident in protecting the club's image. Sir Jim Ratcliffe dubbed Casemiro as \"overpaid\" and \"not good enough\" in March. Three days later, Casemiro trumped his first-leg performance against Sociedad in the 4-1 win at Old Trafford.",
      "His steep decline over 18 months - dropped for Amrabat, substituted for Collyer, omitted from the Brazil squad - makes Casemiro’s revival so singular. If United win the Europa League it would be churlish to argue someone who has won three trophies in three seasons has been an unsuccessful signing.",
      "Casemiro drove United to a successful 2022-23 season. Without him, they would not have qualified for the Champions League. Ten Hag dubbed him the “cement between the stones”, essentially the glue in the team. Casemiro was central to the Latino rebranding of the United defence that kept the most clean sheets in the Premier League.",
      "Casemiro has returned to that level of influence he wielded in his first season. In Europe, at least. The concern if United do not triumph in Bilbao again this month is Casemiro could be redundant in a campaign devoid of Champions League midweeks.

      "According to reports, Manchester United are ‘monitoring’ a left-field No.6 target as a new midfielder is a ‘priority’ for the Premier League giants.",
      "The Red Devils had a positive summer as they spent around £230m as one of the window’s biggest spenders to overhaul their attack by signing Benjamin Sesko, Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha, while they also landed Senne Lammens to replace Andre Onana as their No.1 goalkeeper.",
      "This business has helped Man Utd improve under head coach Ruben Amorim at the start of this campaign, with the club currently five games unbeaten in the Premier League.",
      "This form has seen the Red Devils enter the race to qualify for the Champions League ahead of next season, so they are certainly on track under Amorim.",

      "Baleba reportedly remains on their radar, while Crystal Palace’s Adam Wharton and Nottingham Forest’s Elliot Anderson are also on their radar.",
      "Man Utd would obviously prefer to sign one of these players in January, but this could prove difficult as their current clubs will make it difficult for INEOS.",
      "This could force Man Utd to look for an alternative solution, with a report from The Daily Mail claiming that they are ‘also monitoring Wolves star Joao Gomes’.",
      "United are said to be ‘prioritising buying a new No.6’, with it noted that they ‘would prefer to sign a new midfielder before the World Cup to avoid prices for individual targets soaring if they do well at the tournament, and may have to consider cheaper, emerging targets’.",
      "It is also mentioned that Atletico Madrid’s Conor Gallagher is another candidate. The report adds:",

      "Manchester United’s redemption has taken Ruben Amorim out of immediate contention, with Vitor Pereira a clear frontrunner before Wolves decided to get rid on Sunday.",
      "That put Nuno Espirito Santo and West Ham in clear and present danger of both seeking their third appointment of the season already, but he’s pulled off a couple of wins to ease those fears. Even Nottingham Forest have picked up a win now, which was over Leeds and brings an ever harsher spotlight on Daniel Farke.",
      "And suddenly Eddie Howe is looking a bit nervous too, while Marco Silva also looks to be in serious trouble.",
      "Meanwhile, here are possible replacement managers currently between jobs.",
      "",
      "An earlier version of this oft-updated piece speculated on what might happen to Mikel Arteta should Arsenal suffer from their Nightmare Start. What if they lost a few early games? What then? We concluded this:",
      "It’s far likelier that Arsenal emerge blinking into the autumn sunshine broadly unscathed from their nightmare horrors. No denying that this season does represent one in which Arteta might completely lose the plot and go entirely off the rails. Or the one where he wins the league by 10 points. Feels like we’re odds-on to get one or the other.",
      "Arsenal emerged duly unscathed, and have already cashed in on the shift to easier fixtures of their own alongside much tougher ones for Liverpool to take top spot in the Premier League.",
      "Only question that remains, therefore, is what Arsenal do from here. We are absolutely certain that it either involves p*ssing the league by 10 points or a complete and total meltdown. Nothing in between.",
      "READ: Who will be the next manager of Arsenal if Mikel Arteta is sacked?",
      "",
      "Doing so well that even suffering the ultimate embarrassment of defeat at Old Trafford hasn’t dampened spirits for the most impressive promoted club in quite some time.",
      "Five wins in the bag already, a seven-point lead over Newcastle, and more points than Southampton managed in the entirety of 24/25. Widespread expectation that tougher games would bring Sunderland back down with a bump have thus far proved wide of the mark; there won’t be many teams unhappy at taking four points from two games against Chelsea and Arsenal this season.",
      "",
      "A sacking remains out of the question despite last season’s (relative) struggles. There hasn’t been a Premier League manager since Fergie in his pomp with more credit in the bank than Pep.",
      "But is there still a distinct chance Guardiola decides he’s had enough and simply walks away? We reckon there is, and it’s always worth remembering that we’re talking Next Premier League Manager To Leave here, and that the traditional ‘Sack Race’ shorthand is a bit misleading.",
      "Still, though. Almost no chance at this point that any of that could happen swiftly enough for nobody else to have been canned first. Especially with even a currently not entirely convincing City remaining the only halfway plausible contenders should Arsenal suffer any kind of a wobble.",
      "",
      "Funny old season for Emery already. Began the campaign right at the outside of this market with your Artetas and – unlikely as it now sounds – Slots. Then jumped right up to third favourite when Villa’s rankling disappointment at how last season ended leaked into a six-match winless start to this campaign.",
      "But then along came four Premier League wins in a row to thoroughly lift the mood at a club where a few short weeks ago it really did feel like they’d come to the end of something special without ever getting the definitive moment of success it deserved.",
      "Still feels like it could go either way, for club and manager, but it’s looking more and more positive at home and in Europe, and going into the international break on the back of a 4-0 win over a very good Bournemouth side is a lovely place to be.",
      "",
      "One of the key early-season imponderables for 25/26 was just how big and what kind of impact the Club World Cup might have on the way Chelsea and Man City start the season. Would they hit the ground running, or would they be a bit tired and out of sorts? For both, it’s been a little from column A, a little from column B.",
      "Maresca definitely still has some hearts and minds to win at Chelsea despite the fine finish to the season that saw them tick off Champions League qualification while completing their collection of UEFA pots and pans and then winning the actual Club World Cup.",
      "A home draw with Crystal Palace wasn’t ideal, but the paddling dished out to West Ham has what really should at least be some kind of halfway credible title bid up and running at least. And we strongly suspect Fulham won’t be the last team left scratching their head after losing to Maresca.",
      "There was some talk of ‘Maresca out’ after a draw with Brentford but that was surely only a minority view. After losing to Manchester United in shambolic fashion, there were more on the bandwagon.",
      "That win over Liverpool was big, though, and a particularly good one for Maresca himself. The second half thumping of Forest was handy, too, albeit inevitably saying far more of their opponents than it did of Chelsea. Home defeat to Sunderland saw awkward questions resurfacing, but it’s been two wins from two since then to leave Chelsea quite incongruously third in the league.",
      "",
      "Fine end to 24/25 put a different complexion on Brighton’s season than at one time appeared likely. Ending up a clear best of the rest outside the quickly established top seven represented at least a passing grade and they’d have to make a truly awful start to the season to get in any kind of managerial-change bother.",
      "The win over Newcastle to go with victory at Chelsea to go with a win over City reaffirms Brighton’s big-boy-bothering calibre, but does also make some of their other results – draws with Fulham and Wolves, for instance – a bit annoying. Beating three of the previous season’s top five in your first eight games and still being only 11th in the table after 11 games feels a little bit silly.",
      "",
      "The continuity candidate in the summer, and looked to have received the ultimate hospital pass. How much continuity could there be at Brentford given they’d sold Bryan Mbeumo, Yoane Wissa and Christian Norgaard, while Thomas Frank took most of the remaining coaching staff with him to Tottenham? It was a very Brentford move to promote from within and we’ll hold our hands up and admit we thought it would go far, far worse than it has.",
      "With Newcastle added to Liverpool and Manchester United on the list of Gtech victims this season, it’s an undeniably impressive start in trying circumstances.",
      "",
      "Among the least sackable managers in the top flight, and the only club we could really picture trying to lure him away this summer was Spurs and that’s now safely off the table.",
      "It was a difficult summer for Bournemouth but Iraola had masses of credit in the bank that can get him through things like getting inexplicably pumped 4-0 at goal-shy Villa without too much fuss.",
      "",
      "Won’t be sacked, obviously, because Palace are absolutely punching with an elite-level manager who is quietly delivering astonishing results in trying circumstances.",
      "But with reports he was willing and ready to walk out if Marc Guehi was sold without a replacement point to new strains on a relationship that is bound to be tested in the weeks and months ahead.",
      "Nailed it in the Community Shield, but as ever for clubs on Palace’s level there’s a positive-and-negative scale to be balanced by your manager catching the eye so conspicuously. Glasner absolutely could be poached with bigger beasts surely paying attention to the work he’s done at Selhurst Park.",
      "And if that poaching comes from outside the Premier League, then it comes with the possibility of making Glasner the next Premier League managerial casualty. But still very unlikely.",
      "We’d imagine the significant lowering of the threat level for a Ruben Amorim Sack at United has eased some nerves at Selhurst Park considerably.",
      "",
      "Forget everything we ever wrote about Ruben Amorim being doomed; he has engineered a 2-1 win at Anfield and it’s now three wins in a row after a rollicking good fun 4-2 win over Brighton.",
      "A quite silly 2-2 draw against Forest was probably a bigger setback for that lad off the internet whose long-overdue haircut is once again as far away as ever than it was for Amorim, who was backed when things were going appallingly and isn’t about to get canned now they’re going really quite well. Could probably have done without another silly 2-2 draw at Spurs to follow it, but at least it wasn’t yet another defeat against a Spurs team that has become the scourge of the Manchester clubs for some reason.",
      "",
      "It is still very early days and still too early to tell which way a promising-but-not-flawless start eventually breaks for Frank and Spurs.",
      "He arrived to a club and squad with an awful lot of mess to sort out at history’s funniest ever Champions League qualifiers. He appeared to have already thoroughly De-Anged the lot of them only for them to then turn up against Bournemouth and defend like an Ange team while attacking like a Mourinho one.",
      "You know who else won their first couple of games, including one against Man City, after stepping up to Spurs from a smaller but less daft Premier League club? That’s right. But while the Nuno comparisons are obvious, it doesn’t quite feel like the same situation despite some rumblings of discontent.",
      "Crucially, there was no undignified scramble to find a new manager this time. Whatever your thoughts on the timing and manner of Ange Postecoglou’s sacking and the identity of his replacement, it’s also clear Spurs have got the man they wanted in a way they very obviously didn’t when Nuno came in.",
      "That surely buys Frank a bit of time even if things do get hairy, which they will if that abysmal home form (three wins from 20Premier League games, and just one from six very winnable ones this season) can’t be sorted out. The absolute state of that moribund defeat to Chelsea raised the stakes. A thumping Champions League win over Copenhagen and a very stupid draw against Manchester United is probably just about enough to keep him out of the international break firing line.",
      "",
      "Four points from two games against Manchester United and Leeds has given Forest the lift they badly needed and leaves Dyche as safe as any manager ever can be in Mr Marinakis’ lair.",
      "",
      "Back-to-back wins over Newcastle and Burnley mean it’s a comfier interlull than might have been expected for a manager who, when the Magpies took an early lead at the London Stadium, looked to be heading for a second sack of the season long before the Christmas decorations went up.",
      "",
      "Sounds preposterous, but there really is a non-zero chance Moyes gets punished for easing Everton’s immediate relegation fears and they seek some more enterprising football from a squad that is, in fairness, capable of that. Does feel like a very familiar Everton story, though, and one that ends with them 16th, chastened, and bringing in another firefighter.",
      "We are treating the Brendan Rodgers links with mountains of salt.",
      "",
      "Impossible to avoid the conclusion that Slot’s reaction to Liverpool’s mini-crisis becoming actual-crisis was poor. He went Full Klopp with his salty loser behaviour when Manchester United committed the crime of altering their tactics to give themselves the best chance of success against Liverpool, and the headloss continued after another chaotic and unstructured performance led to a 3-2 defeat at Brentford.",
      "Having ticked ‘opposition doing tactics wrong’ off his rattled manager bingo card, he can now add ‘losing his mind over entirely uncontroversial refereeing decisions’ with his response to both the Cody Gakpo non-penalty and Virgil van Dijk penalty at the Gtech.",
      "It has to be a worry for Liverpool that Slot has for the first time in his Anfield career found himself under any kind of pressure after a chastening run of defeats, and has suffered severe and instant headloss as a result.",
      "Funny to think of a manager who’s just beaten Real Madrid in the Champions League being under threat, but defeat at the Etihad was miserable and leaves Liverpool languishing in eighth.",
      "",
      "Burnley really did have a horrible fixture list in these opening weeks under a manager with a horrible record at this level, and were given an opening-day reminder by the team that finished 17th last season of just how much harder the ‘simply don’t concede any goals at all’ tactic might be to deploy in the Premier League.",
      "Essentially, Burnley have got back to this level the same way Homer Simpson got to a heavyweight title fight. And Spurs and City have already given them a pummelling.",
      "Victories over Sunderland and Leeds were an impressive and necessary reminder that it might still be enough against teams more on their level, and while a 3-2 win at Wolves was not exactly The Burnley Way it’s still three points against an established – if struggling – Premier League side.",
      "Hitting the November international break outside the bottom three does feel like it counts as mission thus far accomplished, but defeat in a six-pointer at West Ham has removed all wriggle room.",
      "",
      "At various points we’ve expended daft amounts of energy attempting to manifest a ‘Howe Sack’ crisis because we’re messy bitches who live for drama. But we’ve never managed to make it stick even a tiny bit and we started the summer thinking there was little imminent prospect of going for it again with Howe the hero of the Geordie Nation for delivering silverware and more lovely, lovely Champions League football.",
      "Now, though, after a traumatic summer and the Alexander Isak Saga and what is now officially an iffy start to the season, our Spidey Sense is tingling once more. League position can mislead given the congestion behind Arsenal and a bloated mid-table, but Newcastle are now closer to the bottom three than they are to 13th-placed Everton, and whatever the mitigation that just won’t do.",
      "",
      "It would have made Spurs’ decision to sack Europa League-winning Ange Postecoglou look positively kind, but there remains a decent case that Leeds – and Burnley for that matter – could or even should have thanked the managers who secured 100 Championship points and got them back into the big time and then sent them on their way.",
      "Farke had a dreadful Premier League record of only six wins and 26 points from his 49 games in charge of Norwich, a team he twice led to promotion from the Championship with 94 and 97 points.",
      "As well as fighting his own record in this competition, Farke faces the added burden of expectation levels very different to those at just about any other club that could possibly find itself promoted into the Premier League in this current era where that represents the most bittersweet of successes.",
      "Defeat at Burnley was honking, but bouncing back to win another six-pointer against West Ham eased the stress significantly before a paddling at Brighton and events elsewhere – including West Ham themselves – left Farke desperately short of immediate cover before a desperately poor show in a six-pointer at Nottingham Forest. It’s deep trouble now.",
      "",
      "We still think they’d regret it if they pull the trigger, but it might be time to accept something is fundamentally broken here as a relegation fight bubbles up.",

      "A transfer insider has told fans to “keep an eye on” the newest England star, as he is a “possibility” for a number of clubs, including Manchester United.",
      "Thomas Tuchel’s latest England squad involved some interest points of discussion. The returns of Phil Foden and Jude Bellingham were to the delight of a lot of fans.",
      "One of the biggest inclusions beyond the star pair was Bournemouth’s Alex Scott, who has played for England under-21s on 11 occasions, and has one goal from 11 games in the Cherries’ midfield this season.",
      "Scott looks to have filled out and become a more physical midfielder this term, adding another string to his bow.",
      "With England honours have come links with some big clubs, with United formerly said to be keen on him, and those links remaining.",
      "That’s according to transfer insider Graeme Bailey, who told United in Focus: “Alex Scott is emerging as a real name now and United are well aware of his talents. I am told they watched him and liked him during his Bristol City days, but now he is maturing into a dominant player.",
      "“We know all the big names linked to United heading into the New Year and ahead of next summer, but keep an eye on Scott – he is a possibility for a number of clubs and that includes United.”",
      "United have been linked with the likes of Carlos Baleba, Adam Wharton and Elliot Anderson in the midfield, but Scott is becoming quite an exciting option, too.",
      "His defensive stats have increased this season, with SofaScore statistics showing Scott has become a better tackler, while his interceptions and ball recoveries have improved.",
      "In the Premier League last season, he averaged 1.4 tackles per game, 0.5 interceptions and 2.6 ball recoveries.",
      "This season, those are up to 1.9, 0.8 and 3.2. While interest was evident earlier in his career, it is not a surprise both that it remains from big teams now and that England honours have arrived.",
      "Should Scott perform well in his first England camp – provided he does in fact get game time – he could cement his place in the Three Lions’ plans and have more big clubs clamouring for him.",
      "Our friends at TEAMtalk have suggested that Tottenham are keen on him, so there are already two big clubs in the mix for the Bournemouth man."

      "You might argue that Wirtz is a £100m-plus player so should be doing better than Leeds United’s Sean Longstaff, but that would be nit-picking.",
      "“Liverpool could also help him out by scoring some of the chances he creates,” said Nagelsmann.",

      "Some at Manchester United are reportedly ‘internally’ still questioning the decision to sell Alejandro Garnacho, who it’s felt needed ‘guidance and man-management’ and got neither from Ruben Amorim.",
      "United got some saleable assets out of the door in the summer. Garnacho and Antony were the two sales made, while Rasmus Hojlund and Marcus Rashford will likely bring in permanent fees if United decide to sell at the end of their respective loans in Europe.",
      "The sale of Garnacho is one that Amorim essentially forced, having apparently told the winger he would have to find himself another club to play for.",
      "The United boss apparently said to him: “You better pray that you can find a club to sign you.”",
      "That informed other clubs that he was definitely on the chopping block, and allowed Chelsea to sign him for less than United wanted.",
      "While the Blues long showed an interest in Garnacho, meaning the Red Devils knew there was somewhere for him to be offloaded, there are apparently some at his former club who feel he shouldn’t have been sold.",
      "The Amorim fallout was due to public comments made by Garnacho, but according to The Telegraph, there are some at the club who ‘internally’ still question the decision to offload him.",
      "Indeed, they feel he was ‘simply young and petulant’ and was ‘in need of guidance and careful man-management,’ which Amorim clearly did not give him, as opposed to ‘being cast as a bad egg and a corrosive presence.’",
      "However, United seemingly see offloading Garnacho as a good choice, as Omar Berrada and Jason Wilcox were ‘determined to ensure’ that Amorim’s authority was not questioned in any way.",
      "They similarly got shot of Rashford, who Amorim clearly was not a fan of early on, with the forward only playing six games for the United boss early on in his tenure.",
      "While he scored three goals in those games, Rashford’s training efforts were not appreciated by Amorim, who loaned him out first to Aston Villa in January and then Barcelona this season.",
      "While some believe Rashford would improve the current United team, given he has six goals and nine assists as a Barcelona player already, it is unlikely Amorim cares what his side would look like with the former academy man in it.",
      "Chelsea have reportedly made an enquiry for one of the world’s most in-form midfielders and have a secret weapon to potentially convince the star to join them.",

      "The Red Devils rescued a point in the dying moments of a 2-2 draw against Tottenham over the weekend with Matthijs de Ligt’s header maintaining their five-match unbeaten run in the Premier League.",

      "Ruben Amorim hinted after the match that Man Utd could have to look at strengthening their forward line in the winter window as he pointed to Sesko’s injury and Bryan Mbeumo and Amad Diallo leaving for AFCON.",
      "Amorim told reporters: “We have to check everything, we have to check what’s happened with Ben.",
      "“Of course we are going to have a problem there (AFCON), but we already knew, you can prepare in summer, but then you have a lot of players who are not going to play because it’s one game a week, so the manage of that situation is going to be hard, so let’s see when the window is open if we can improve the team and trying to repair something that happened. Until then we have to take the chance. We’ll see.”",
      "READ: Ruben Amorim authority rising on one-year anniversary at Man Utd",
      "But Romano reckons it could be unlikely that Man Utd sign a new striker if Sesko is only out for a short period of time.",
      "Romano said on his YouTube channel: “While I’m recording this video, it’s 2:30pm in England, but still no official statement from Manchester United on the injury of Benjamin Sesko.",
      "“My information, guys, is that internally at Man United, they feel that is not going to be a super long injury, so not six, seven, eight months, not that kind of injury. That’s the feeling of Manchester United. It’s going to take some time, of course, he’s not going to be not going to be ready tomorrow morning, but not going to be a super long injury.",
      "“And that’s obviously an important news, an important impact. Also Manchester United strategies, because Ruben Amorim after the game, they had a draw against Tottenham and Ruben Amorim said: ‘Let’s see also the injury of Sesko We have some players going for AFCON. And then there is the injury of Sesko that might impact the general transfer window for Man United.",
      "“Well,  in case of long injury, maybe season over, in that case, Man United had to consider something for the general transfer window. Now, the expectation, according to my information internally, Man United feel that the injury is not super serious, it’s not going to be super long. It’s going to take some time again, it’s not a short one, but not gonna take super long, and that’s important.",
      "“So let’s wait for Manchester United statement, but that’s the feeling.",
      "“Just one for a few questions linked to this situation. First questions in England, some reports of maybe Rasmus Hojland can come back to Man United, from Napoli loan to cover the Sesko injury…no Rasmus Hojland doesn’t have any recall clause to his contract at Napoli with Manchester United for the loan.",
      "“So there is no recall clause. And also, Hojland feels as a Napoli player, not as a Man United player on loan. Hojland, 100% feels as a Napoli player. Napoli have all the intentions to sign Hojland on a permanent transfer from Man United, so with an obligation to buy there is an obligation to buy clause.",
      "“Man United expect to receive a 50 million euros for Hojland, and they’re not planning to have the player back at the club. So at the moment, the situation is completely quiet about that, nothing expected in terms of movements for Rasmus Hojland, apart from what happens with Benjamin Sesko.”",
      "And website United in Focus have revealed that Man Utd have sent scouts out to Qatar to watch the Under-17 World Cup and ‘among them was the Brazilian Erling Haaland, 17-year-old Dell from Bahia’.",
      "The report adds: ‘Alongside a handful of Brazilians, United were keeping an eye on Dell and with three goals in the competition already, that interest will be growing, but he won’t come cheap.’",

      "Laurie Whitwell wrote: ‘Manuel Ugarte played for Amorim at Sporting between 2021 and 2023, but he was not given special treatment during the end-of-season meeting at Carrington that followed United’s Europa League final loss to Tottenham Hotspur. This was the gathering, the day before United faced Aston Villa in the final Premier League game, where Amorim told Alejandro Garnacho he would need a good agent during the summer window due to him remaining as head coach. That conflict was what attracted the headlines when details emerged.",
      "‘Several players were on the receiving end, too, but Amorim had particularly pointed feedback for Ugarte, who he felt had let his work rate slide from their time together at Sporting. Amorim believed Ugarte had gotten comfortable and said he did not recognise him as the same player from their first stint together.’",

      "The Telegraph reports how Amorim, with ‘tears forming in his eyes’ accidentally smashed a TV in the Old Trafford dressing room, after launching into an ‘angry tirade’ about the game.",
      "The report details how it shocked the players to see the boss in that light, but there were some who ‘totally understood his strength of feeling’ and some therefore ‘grew in respect for him.’",
      "Amorim himself has detailed how he needs to better keep his emotions in check, but them spilling over in this instance was good for him.",
      "The most notable example of Amorim making his feelings clear was when he suggested sometimes he does not want to be in the job.",
      "He said: “Sometimes I want to quit, sometimes I want to be here for 20 years. Sometimes I love to be with my players. Sometimes I don’t want to be with my players. I need to improve on that. It is going to be hard.”",
      "That came after a shock League Cup loss to Grimsby, but United have since been far better and look to be in a good spot going forwards, if they can maintain their current form.",
      "According to reports, Manchester United are ‘monitoring’ a left-field No.6 target as a new midfielder is a ‘priority’ for the Premier League giants.",

      "Man Utd head coach Ruben Amorim reportedly called out Manuel Ugarte in front of his team-mates for letting ‘his work rate slide’.",

      "Wayne Rooney has revealed three “horrendous” signings Man Utd made before last summer as their recruitment strategy was heavily criticised.",
      "The Red Devils hierarchy have been criticised for at least a decade for their poor recruitment decisions which have seen Man Utd pay way over the odds for players.",
      "Man Utd have not properly challenge for the Premier League title since Sir Alex Ferguson left Old Trafford and retired in 2013.",
      "A lot of that has been put down to bad transfer decisions with the Red Devils often preferring to buy a big name over a potential future superstar.",
      "And Man Utd legend Rooney has criticised the club for bringing in the likes of Paul Pogba, Romelu Lukaku and Zlatan Ibrahimovic on huge wages.",
      "Rooney said on The Overlap: “The recruitment at Manchester United before last summer was horrendous.",
      "READ: Ruben Amorim authority rising on one-year anniversary at Man Utd",
      "“They were just bringing big names in – you look at Lukaku, Zlatan, Pogba – they’re good players but they were just bringing names in and spending enormous amounts of money.",
      "“It’s going to take a bit of time to get over those mistakes.”",
      "Rooney hopes Man Utd are now turning a corner under Ruben Amorim and the new leadership of Sir Jim Ratcliffe and INEOS.",
      "The Man Utd legend added: “If you look at Manchester United over the last ten years, the players have been absolutely battered. Now they’ve got a couple of results and you can see a bit of confidence coming back.",
      "“You can even say that in the manager. They’re gradually getting better, there’s definitely been some improvement.",
      "“It’s been really tough for Ruben Amorim and I’ve been critical of him. We are seeing them improve though and players are getting to know each other a bit better.",
      "“There’s some promising signs and although they’re not going to win the league they could possibly sneak into the top-four.”",
      "Rooney also named Sunderland midfielder Granit Xhaka as the signing of the season so far after the newly-promoted side drew against Premier League leaders Arsenal over the weekned.",
      "Speaking on The Wayne Rooney Show, he said: “Coming back to the Premier League you wonder if he can do it. Obviously with a promoted team as well coming up, what impact could he have?",
      "“But he’s probably been the signing of the season. He has been brilliant.”",
      "Rooney added on Xhaka: “When he had the situation with Arsenal, when he fell out with the fans it showed his character to go and play for Arsenal again.",
      "“To get through that and then go and perform for Arsenal, and then at Leverkusen to be part of a team to beat Bayern Munich to the title for the first time in over 10 years has shown what a good player he is.",
      "“Sunderland have got a very young squad as well. He’d almost be like a father figure and he’ll be a big help for the coach as well to be the in-between man as captain.",
      "“And they made a lot of signings in the summer, he’ll be a massive help for the manager and with them players, for sure, using his experience.”",

      "Today would have been the day Ruben Amorim was dreading; his one-year anniversary is said to be the day it becomes considerably cheaper to sack him.",
      "But Manchester United’s recent performances mean the manager might never have sat quite so comfortably in the Old Trafford hotseat.",
      "Of the five international breaks he has spent as United boss, this must be the one he has felt most at ease with himself and the events unfolding around him. Amorim will certainly sleep better this fortnight than he did during the October break.",
      "Even some warm-ish words from his boss won’t have soothed the concerns Amorim had for his prospects of making a relative success of his United reign. He went into the four-game run between interlulls knowing he had three weeks, not three years, to prove himself.",
      "Now, on the back of two wins and two draws extending an unbeaten run to five, Amorim ought to feel like he has earned himself some breathing space.",
      "‘Teams who have beaten Liverpool’ is almost the least exclusive club in football right now, but that did not make United’s first win at Anfield in almost a decade any less sweet. Even more satisfyingly for the manager, it was a consequence of getting his tactics ‘spot on’.",
      "The joy of beating their biggest rivals would have been forgotten six days later had Brighton rocked up at Old Trafford – the Amex North in recent years – and won for the fourth season in succession. But United, if a little chaotically, put the Seagulls to the sword to climb briefly into the top four. It wasn’t immediately obvious which was the bigger novelty.",
      "Then came successive 2-2 draws in games that showed some familiar failings but illustrated again the kind of resilience too often missing from United sides in recent seasons.",
      "That determination, the hint of some cojones in Amorim’s ranks, is perhaps the most encouraging facet of those four performances. In each game, United have suffered set-backs but offered a spirited and tangible reaction each time.",
      "At Liverpool, when Cody Gakpo levelled, more Merseyside misery felt inevitable, especially given Arne Slot’s oddly gung-ho approach. Instead, United dug in and, via the magnificence of Harry Maguire’s bulbous bonce, seized all three points when most doubted they would take one.",
      "The Brighton game was going much more serenely with United 3-0 up. Not quite uncharted territory for Amorim, but certainly unfamiliar, so perhaps we ought to give him a pass for the changes made in the name of load management that almost saw the Seagulls dump a big one on Old Trafford again. United weathered a storm at 3-2 and produced a moment of decisive attacking quality to make the game safe once more.",
      "Narrower leads at Forest and Spurs were squandered and, worse, overturned. But, again, United showed the character to earn creditable points when previously, most likely, they would have meekly accepted their fate.",
      "The TL;DR from those four games: United remain a flawed outfit – obviously – but they are developing a knack of covering up those flaws rather better. And there are signs of more sustainable improvement.",
      "Certainly individually. Just with the most basic level of competency, Senne Lammens has brought some serenity to United’s rearguard, almost certainly aided by more assured performances from Luke Shaw and, most noticeably, Matthijs De Ligt.",
      "Or perhaps the presence of a trustworthy goalkeeper is soothing defenders’ nerves shredded by two seasons in front of Andre Onana and the Turkish fella deemed less competent even than the Cameroonian. Regardless, for Stretford Enders, watching United defend now feels a less sphincter-shrinking experience than it did even before the last break.",
      "It must help too that the football was only ever taking a break from Casemiro – it never left him after all. The Brazilian, on a similar redemption arc to Maguire, has gone from an expensive liability to the midfielder Amorim can’t be without.",
      "Not just because the 33-year-old has rediscovered his mojo but primarily because the drop-off between him and Manuel Ugarte is so alarmingly stark. The urge to give Casemiro a breather against Brighton was understandable, but Amorim will know now it is not a luxury he can yet afford until United furnish him with another ready-to-go No.6.",
      "They recognised the need in the summer but failed to move decisively. United are never shy in telling us how prohibitive the January market can be, but it is not a mistake Amorim or United can afford to make two summers in succession. That Amorim can even contemplate thinking so far ahead is testament to the Red Devils’ recent form.",
      "As it turns out, United made more savvy moves than mis-steps in the market this year. Just being rid of the bomb squad banished by Amorim’s firm approach has improved the mood and manner at Carrington, further enhanced by the presence and influence of Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo, two stars apparently born for a stage like Old Trafford, neither afraid of the responsibility that comes with the privilege.",
      "Like any team, United is the sum of its parts, and Amorim is positively effecting his individuals. Just as importantly, especially at Old Trafford where the whims of the dressing room have buried previous managers, the level of fight plainly evident suggests those players are buying into the boss too.",
      "Full steam ahead, Champions League, then? Steady on. Amorim’s dogmatic faith in one particular system still feels naïve but his blunt honesty, combined with concrete improvements, makes him easier to root for.",
      "A year to the day since he first walked into a building site at Carrington and a dressing room worthy of being condemned, Amorim has earned him the chance to build on the foundations of his rebuild.",
      "According to reports, Manchester United are ‘monitoring’ a left-field No.6 target as a new midfielder is a ‘priority’ for the Premier League giants.",
      "Marco Silva has suddenly become the Sack Race favourite as Fulham consider a stupid decision, but Eddie Howe and Arne Slot are far from safe…",
      "Germany coach Julian Nagelsmann is blaming Florian Wirtz’s Liverpool teammates for ‘not liking to shoot the ball in’. Hmmmm.",
      "Ruben Amorim reportedly ‘chuckled privately’ at the suggestion that he and Ange Postecoglou were in the same situation after Tottenham beat Manchester United to the Europa League, making a “bigger ...",
      "You really don’t want to become really quite rubbish just as the international break begins. It’s a long time to be looking at Newcastle in 14th.",
      "Ruben Amorim has managed Manchester United for exactly a year and an entire season’s worth of games. Positionally, the verdict isn’t good…"

      "The sister of a star Premier League midfielder has revealed why he turned down the chance to join Manchester United and instead headed to a league rival.",
      "United’s midfield is perhaps the area causing the most worry at the moment. The attack has been addressed, with summer signings Bryan Mbeumo – Premier League player of the month for October – Matheus Cunha and Benjamin Sesko all developing well.",
      "There is a wealth of defensive options, with the likes of Matthijs de Ligt, Lisandro Martinez, Leny Yoro and Harry Maguire in the centre, and Patrick Dorgu, Diogo Dalot and Amad Diallo out in the wide roles.",
      "But in the midfield, Manuel Ugarte has struggled, Casemiro has been inconsistent, Bruno Fernandes is playing out of position and Kobbie Mainoo can’t get a game.",
      "United attempted to sort their midfield in 2024, with Amadou Onana courted after a solid spell with Everton.",
      "His sister has now revealed why Onana turned down United in favour of heading to Aston Villa, where he’s since played 43 times and scored six goals.",
      "Onana’s sister and agent, Melissa, said: “Aston Villa’s sporting project was crystal clear. It was a project where Amadou could continue to develop. We spoke with the sporting director, and the salary was also attractive, let’s not kid ourselves.",
      "“The Euros were coming up, Amadou was performing well, and we finalised the deal. Then, Manchester United entered the picture. But I had already given my word to Aston Villa.",
      "“We knew very well that Manchester would be able to offer better financial terms, but we had already given our word to Aston Villa, and the project was a good fit. The style of football played, the club’s ambition: Amadou felt right at home there.”",
      "Had United’s approach come earlier, Onana could perhaps have been lacing up his boots at Old Trafford now rather than Villa Park.",
      "Given the current drawbacks of the United midfield, there’s a good chance Onana would be starting there.",
      "That said, when fit, he has been an important member of Villa’s side. This season, either side of a hamstring injury, Onana has played seven times in the Premier League, starting six games and scoring once.",
      "That goal came in a 4-0 thrashing of Bournemouth last time out – who started the day above Villa – and pushed the Midlands outfit up to sixth in the table, within two points of third.",
      "As such, there is a sense that Villa could push on and continue to impress, as they have done for the last couple of seasons -finishing in the top six in both."

      "The Serie A frontrunners, managed by Antonio Conte, see Mainoo as the final piece in their Scudetto and Champions League puzzle, and are willing to meet Man Utd‘s financial demands to make it happen.",
      "Sources close to Mainoo reveal the England international is increasingly receptive to a January switch to Naples.",
      "While he would ideally stay in the Premier League, the recent success of British talents in Italy – Scott McTominay’s seamless integration at Napoli and Ruben Loftus-Cheek’s resurgence at AC Milan – has piqued his interest.",
      "“Kobbie sees the pathway,” one insider said. “Regular football in a title race and Europe is exactly what he needs for the World Cup.”",
      "Napoli’s proposal remains unchanged: a straight loan with an option to buy, covering Mainoo’s full weekly wages. President Aurelio De Laurentiis has green-lit the deal, viewing the teenager as a long-term successor to Stanislav Lobotka.",
      "Conte has personally assured Mainoo of a starring role alongside McTominay and Billy Gilmour in a dynamic, high-pressing midfield. Napoli would also be keen on a loan with an option to buy, but sources say a permanent move in January is not something on United’s radar.",
      "DON’T MISS ➡️ The 10 Erik ten Hag signings still at Man Utd and when they could leave",
      "At Old Trafford, Ruben Amorim’s stance is clear: Mainoo leaves only if a replacement arrives first.",
      "The Portuguese coach refuses to weaken his squad mid-season. Indeed, United have plans to add to their midfield and interest in a number of profiles, including Nottingham Forest’s Elliot Anderson, with a senior source stating: “Ruben won’t sanction Kobbie’s exit unless the depth is maintained. A new body in, then the door opens.”",
      "With Tottenham, Newcastle, and Manchester City still monitoring Mainoo, Napoli hold the edge.",
      "As TEAMtalk previously reported, Mainoo’s camp is now in “positive dialogue” with the Partenopei.",

      "Rio Ferdinand has picked out the three players key to Manchester United’s recent improvement under Ruben Amorim.",
      "The Portuguese boss was being tipped for the Old Trafford sack for the first couple of months of the campaign, which featured Premier League defeats to Arsenal, Manchester City and Brentford, as well as the harrowing League Cup exit at the hands of League Two Grimsby Town.",
      "But a run of five Premier League games unbeaten to lift United to seventh in the Premier League has granted Amorim breathing space and hope for the future of the club, with a number of players – old and new – producing fine individual performances.",
      "When asked who United’s ‘most important player right now’ is, Ferdinand said on Rio Ferdinand Presents: “I don’t think it’s one man. It can’t be down to one man. [Matthijs] De Ligt has been our best defender this season, he is even adding goals for us, like the last-minute goal the other day.",
      "“But in terms of his his press, he’s assertive and has willingness to go into foreign areas of the pitch to defend at right times. His clearing out of his box is brilliant.",
      "“[Bryan] Mbeumo has been a joke as well. He’s really stepped in and been a mainstay and is someone who can give us two or three seconds on the ball, score important goals for us, create chances.",
      "“I saw Thomas Frank’s comments about him yesterday, being a complete winger. I think, by the end of the season, he will be one of the most complete wingers in the league. He can do everything, he just needs to keep consistently doing that in a red shirt.”",
      "Amorim will be without Mbeumo over the Christmas period and into the new year when the Cameroonian heads to the Africa Cup of Nations.",
      "And the United boss admitted that his absence may lead the Red Devils hierarchy to push for reinforcements in January.",
      "“Of course, we are going to have a problem there, but we already knew that,” he said. “So the management of that situation is going to be hard.”",
      "“But let’s see when the window is open, if we can improve the team and try to repair something that happened. Until then, we have to take the chance.”",
      "Ferdinand also named Senne Lammens, who joined from Royal Antwerp for £22m in the summer, as another key player in their upturn.",
      "The 23-year-old spent the first three games on the bench but has now asserted himself as United’s No.1 ahead of Altay Bayindir after Andre Onana joined Trabzonspor on loan.",
      "“And the goalkeeper,” Ferdinand continued. “You can’t talk about anyone being our most important player without the goalkeeper.",
      "“It is no coincidence with our upturn in form that we have a goalkeeper it seems all our players trust.”",
      "Manchester United legend Rio Ferdinand insists it was “brilliant” to see Virgil van Dijk call out Wayne Rooney’s criticism of the Liverpool defender.",
      "Rio Ferdinand has rejected Gary Lineker’s claim that Arsenal star Victor Gyokeres must start scoring against top teams to avoid “flat-track bully” label.",
      "Rio Ferdinand doesn’t think £65m for Luis Diaz was “good business” for Liverpool. We’re confident it was very good business, actually.",
      "Man Utd legend Rio Ferdinand insists Ruben Amorim is “playing Russian Roulette with his job” after refusing to change his tactics.",
      "Manchester United legend Rio Ferdinand has hit out at his former club for letting one player leave who “should have stayed”.",
      "Rio Ferdinand has hit out at Jamie Carragher over his ‘disrespect’ of a Man Utd star who’s proven him wrong under Ruben Amorim this season."

      "No club has been picked for more Premier League TV games than Manchester United, with a surprise team alongside them and ahead of Arsenal and Liverpool",
      "Premier League clubs received a total of £2.83billion last season, which was comprised of six payments through the division’s ‘central revenue system’, something the Premier League says ‘ensures the most equitable distribution of funds of any major European league’.",
      "Liverpool were paid £174.9m as champions – short of Manchester City’s record £176.2m in 2022/23 – while Newcastle received just over £160m to chuck into their PSR black hole.",
      "Southampton were handed £109.2m for their efforts in finishing a distant bottom. It pays to be in the Premier League.",
      "Some of those payments are fixed. All 20 clubs automatically receive around £96.9m through an equal share distributed based on both the domestic (£29.8m in 2024/25) and international (£59.2m in 2024/25) broadcast deals – those TV rights are lucrative for a reason – as well as £7.9m each from central commercial revenue streams.",
      "The rest is variable, based on where clubs finish and how often their games are selected for broadcast.",
      "",
      "The Premier League merit payments are distributed on a sliding scale from 1st to 20th, made up of combined earnings from domestic and international broadcast deals.",
      "For the 2024/25 season, the difference in prize money was around £2.7m per position. Southampton were given as much for finishing bottom, all the way up to champions Liverpool receiving £53.1m. It basically helped pay for 97.4% of Giorgi Mamardashvili and Jeremie Frimpong.",
      "That can be expected to fluctuate with inflation and other factors – it was around £2.8m per position in 2023/24 – but it offers a rough guide as to what clubs should expect to earn this season.",

      "20th (Wolves) – £2.7m",
      "",
      "The only other part of the prize money which is not fixed and shared equally are the facility fees, which are based on how many times each club has been selected for television.",
      "In 2024/25, Liverpool had 30 games televised in the UK, for which they received £24.9m in facility fees. Arsenal had 29 matches and were paid £24.2m, while Manchester United (28 games for £23.4m), Aston Villa (27 games for £22.6m) and Chelsea (26 games for £21.8m) were televised frequently and rewarded handsomely.",
      "Ipswich were shown on the fewest occasions and received £8.9m in facility fees for their 10 live televised UK fixtures.",
      "This can lead to discrepancies in terms of those variable payments. Manchester United’s prize money after finishing 15th last season was £136.2m, more than the four clubs immediately above them – West Ham (£130.9m in 14th), Everton (£131.8m in 13th), Crystal Palace (£136.1m in 12th) and Fulham (£135.5m in 11th) – as Ruben Amorim’s side were picked for far more live TV games.",
      "Spurs were another massive outlier, earning more in 17th (£127.8m) than Wolves did in 16th (£123.1m) in part because they had nine more games picked for live UK broadcast.",

      "One big change in Premier League prize money going forward is that the 2025/26 season represents the start of a new four-year TV deal cycle.",
      "A new record £6.7bn domestic rights deal will see the number of live games rocket up to 267 of a possible 380, with every Premier League game outside the protected Saturday 3pm kick-offs to be broadcast live.",
      "Their packages include all Saturday 5.30pm, Sunday 2pm and Sunday 4.30pm kick-offs, plus Monday and Friday evening games and three midweek rounds.",
      "Overseas TV rights are worth more than £2bn per year to the Premier League with new deals signed with broadcasters in Japan and Mexico to go alongside lucrative packages in America, Scandinavia, Thailand, China, India and elsewhere.",
      "But the facility fee payments are tied to how many times a team is picked for broadcast by Sky and TNT, with both broadcasters having made their picks up to before Boxing Day. One game generally translates to roughly £0.83m but does fluctuate.",

      "",
      "Lumped them in together here because they’re unlikely to be Golden Boot winners but they could be 20-goal strikers, which would be bloody lovely for both.",
      "",
      "Made a flying start to his Liverpool career but might he just prove a bit too ‘scorer of great goals, not great goalscorer’ across an entire campaign?",
      "",
      "A wonderfully chaotic option for Spurs. We suspect Thomas Frank is gutted that he remains Tottenham’s top scorer.",

      "Well look at that: An actual Manchester United player scoring actual Premier League goals. He’s 40/1 but even appearing on this list feels like a great leap forward.",
      "",
      "This is looking like hope over experience, with Salah miles off it in what is now officially a struggling, crisis-addled Liverpool.",
      "",
      "Surely the man best placed if something horrendous were to befall Haaland as he has actually scored a whole lot of Premier League goals. How the f*** do Brentford keep pulling this off?",
      "",
      "The Proper Striker to finally deliver the title to Arsenal? Not on the evidence of that opening-day performance v Man Utd or the first half against Leeds but definitely possibly of the second half. There was no sign of him adding to that total v Liverpool but he did score v Nottingham Forest and Burnley.",
      "Arsenal’s title challenge is in textbook shape, but there hasn’t been that much contribution from the striker they apparently needed to drag them over the line. The fact that he is already as long as 20s here shows how far he is behind…",
      "",
      "Looking to reclaim his crown after last season’s ‘struggles’ and made – as he generally does – a rapid start to the season with a couple of goals on the opening day as the familiar focal point of a new-look Man City side. It’s an absurd lead at this stage, really, with his own nonsense compounded by none of the other most likely contenders – with all due respect to your Semenyos and Thiagos – doing anything all that compelling to challenge him.",

Igor Thiago is putting up the closest resistance to Erling Haaland in the Golden Boot race but the Brazilian has also made the most tackles (15) of any orthodox Premier League centre-forward this season by a mile. The next best is actually Kevin Schade, who has made eight in just three games playing through the middle.",
      "",
      "If it’s credit they want for beating the league’s managerless bottom side on course to lower the bar for historic awfulness, they have come to the wrong place.",

      "The talent pool is realistically far too deep for him to make a splash but Everton are benefiting from his ambition. Garner has not missed a single minute all season in all competitions and was central to a tactical shift Moyes finally implemented against Fulham.",
      "Tim Iroegbunam was trusted to provide energy and perhaps the single greatest assist in Premier League history, with Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall embracing an all-action, duel-winning role further forward as Garner brought far more balance to the team when making his first start at right-back in over a year.",
      "There were a couple of hairy moments up against Kevin but the slight defensive drop-off was justified by the control and influence he offered going forward. Garner ranked first for touches, passes, carries and shots in a quietly accomplished performance.",

      "Only two players who have yet to start a Premier League game this season have still managed to score or assist more than a single goal. While Federico Chiesa labours to prove something to Arne Slot, there is little doubt that Regis Le Bris fully appreciates the “different profile” his chaotic Mr. Brobbey offers.",

      "Even though that process was expedited somewhat, Canvot proved himself a player who can be tentatively trusted to perform at the necessary level already.",
      "Eight clearances, three tackles, two interceptions and even four fouls committed nowhere near danger – three were in Brighton’s final third and the other was on the halfway line – combined with composure and security on the ball suggests Palace might have found another defensive gem who is perfectly attuned to their needs.",

      "Godspeed, *checks notes* James Collins. The nondescript name is a sublime touch.",

      "It cannot be often that a visiting player makes the most passes of anyone at the Etihad. But then that was part of the plan for Pep Guardiola: he identified Konate as a weak point and specifically ensured the ball was funnelled out to him as often as possible.",
      "Only four players in the entire league have made more errors leading to an opposition shot this season. And going by the statistics, Konate did not add to that tally against Manchester City. But he did make the biggest mistake leading to a penalty, deflected the first goal in off his head after barely jumping, and welcomed Jeremy Doku inside like an old friend to score.",

      "It is no coincidence that one of the two changes Howe made to his starting line-up provided Newcastle’s best performance of a painful bunch. Harvey Barnes scored a wonderful goal in place of Anthony Gordon but beyond that, it was more of the same: a questionable keeper, a vulnerable defence, a weak midfield, an impotent attack and a team devoid of confidence.",
      "The sack and relegation chat will carry through the black hole of an international break. Something is certainly not right. It is remarkably stark that having dropped the fewest points from winning positions of any Premier League club last season (seven), they have dropped the most so far this campaign (nine). This isn’t the Newcastle we know.",

      "It is tough to look past him as Manchester United’s current biggest problem.",
      "His personal goal difference is abysmal, beaten by just 35 players in the whole league, all of whom play for teams in the bottom five. Ugarte, a £50.5m midfielder for the side in seventh, has been on the pitch for four Manchester United goals and 11 against.",
      "That is sometimes a coincidence and not his responsibility to bear. But against Spurs he was beaten by Wilson Odobert in the build up to the first goal and played Richarlison onside for the second.",
      "It is genuinely borderline impressive to play 304 (30.7%) of a club’s 990 minutes but be present for 11 (61.1%) of the 18 goals they have conceded, even if not always – but usually – culpable.",
      "And that omits the Grimsby Town defeat in which he was substituted at half time.",
      "The Manchester United player with the best personal goal difference? Casemiro on +8. That reflects abysmally on the player who usually replaces him.",
      "",
      "The bigger issue for Burnley is and was always going to be conceding goals, but ultimately when your otherwise excellent keeper flaps a couple into his own net there is no need for an extensive defensive post-mortem.",
      "Far stranger is the £15.4m Belgian international elephant in the room. Tresor continues to await not only his first league appearance since joining the Clarets permanently in summer 2024, but his maiden league matchday squad.",
      "Actual Bayern Munich manager Vincent Kompany suggested the Championship would be “a good step” for Tresor “into giving this team what we know he is able to give” after his struggle for minutes on loan in 2023/24. But Parker has given the 26-year-old one solitary hour of game time across three substitute cameos in the FA and Carabao Cups in the last 15 months.",

      "Ally McCoist and former Man Utd goalkeeper Ben Foster have picked out lots of positives after the Red Devils held Tottenham to a 2-2 draw on Saturday.",
      "Spurs thought they had won the game when Richarlison put Thomas Frank’s side ahead in second half injury time after Bryan Mbeumo and Mathys Tel had scored earlier in the match.",
      "But Matthijs de Ligt popped up in the sixth minute of injury time to salvage a point from the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium and keep Man Utd on a run of five Premier League matches unbeaten.",
      "Many onlookers were underwhelmed by the performance of both teams but McCoist and Foster can see the positives in recent weeks.",
      "McCoist thinks Man Utd are now “harder to play against”, “better in forward areas” and more resilient, while he picked out Amad Diallo and Patrick Dorgu for their good displays against Tottenham.",
      "Speaking to host Jeff Stelling on talkSPORT, McCoist said: “I also think Jeff, in times gone by they wouldn’t have got the point. I think there’s more about them, it’s evident. There’s far more about them. Miles away from the finished article it has to be said. But they look slightly harder to play against, and they certainly look, I think, better in forward areas.",
      "READ: Man Utd could revert to type as two summer signings justify Ruben Amorim’s new transfer priority",
      "“Some good performances. I thought Dorgu played well. I thought Amad played really, really well. We’ve mentioned Cunha and Mbeumo before. Those two in particular, at this early stage, I think two terrific new signings can handle it, not even handle it, look as though they’re thriving in that kind of situation.",
      "“So I think at this early stage, there’s must be heaps of positives from Manchester United, but still a lot of work to do. But I take your point. They’re disappointed at getting the point, but I think maybe, you know, certainly last season, I don’t think they’re getting the point.”",
      "When asked if he sensed a changing attitude at Man Utd, former goalkeeper Ben Foster added: “Yeah, I think Ally’s probably just said everything that needed to be said right there. I only watched the game on the TV, but they look okay.",
      "“They look like they’re playing with a lot more confidence and have done for most of this season. But I just think when you sort of contrast it to the quality of Man City, for example, last night, I think it’s very evident there’s still quite a way to go.”",
      "McCoist added: “I think that’s in a nutshell, mate, I really do. I think there’s definitely been improvements. I think the positivity around Manchester United is understandable. And so there should be the small steps, but in terms of the large steps needed to get to the likes of the level of Manchester City, which we saw yesterday, they are still a good bit away.",
      "“But I still think Amorim speaks really well better, don’t you think? And I think I actually think it was a good piece of ownership coming out and effectively backing him for a couple of years so that everybody knows [he’s going to be there a while]. And just as importantly, never mind the fans knowing, I think the players knowing that he’s going to be there for a while is something as well.”",
      "Foster continued: “I think people just tend to forget that the Premier League is actually really hard. To be honest, the general quality of the Premier League is really, really hard and to put a string of games together [is difficult].",
      "“We’re saying it all over the Premier League, but a string of games together where you’re winning consistently is really, really hard to do. So sometimes you just have to make sure you don’t lose. And I think for Manchester United, they would have lost that game earlier in the season, they would have lost that game.",
      "“They wouldn’t have had it about them to go and really search for that equaliser. I think it’s the mentality shift, the mentality change in the players. They’re all starting to buy into it now, from what the manager is saying. He’s been saying it for the best part of the year, in fairness to him – but I think it’s finally seeping into the players, and you can see when players play with that belief, and that positivity and the confidence, that you get better results for it as well.”",
      "Five pundits give their predictions as Liverpool face Man Utd on Sunday looking to an end a run of three straight defeats in all competitions.",
      "Ally McCoist and Rio Ferdinand thinks Man Utd boss Ruben Amorim should be given “more time” at Old Trafford amid sack rumours.",
      "Rangers legend Ally McCoist has changed his Premier League title prediction after backing Liverpool before the season kicked off.",
      "Ruben Amorim “has got a couple of months left” at Man Utd, according to Ben Foster, but one of his likely replacements has a big “worry” hanging over him.",
      "Premier League legend David Beckham has tipped Newcastle to “surprise” people in this season’s Champions League, while Ben Foster believes Nick Woltemade is “made for” the Magpies.",
      "Man Utd have been told by Ben Foster that they made a “panic buy” on the deadline day when they brought in Senne Lammens from Royal Antwerp."

      "Including only those who have played three or more games, here’s how the Premier League shot-stoppers are performing this season.",
      "And here’s who was the best goalkeeper in 2024/25.",
      "",
      "Spurs being wretched against Chelsea wasn’t bad news for everyone at Spurs – Vicario padded his stats by conceding just one from a PSxG of 3.2. Though against Manchester United, you might wonder if he could have done more to keep out the two headers that beat him.",
      "",
      "Henderson had serene outings against Brentford and Brighton, keeping consecutive clean sheets as Palace firm up again. The England keeper will doubtless fancy himself as Thomas Tuchel’s No.1 in USA next summer. Any chance?",
      "",
      "Replacing clean sheet machine Trafford at Burnley, Dubravka has made a very solid start at Turf Moor. Which is handy since he has faced more shots than any other goalkeeper. Might already have save of the season tied up after preserving Burnley’s win at Wolves in the dying seconds but should have done more to prevent West Ham’s second and third goals.",
      "What a save from Dubravka 🧤 pic.twitter.com/YmY4Lq2abB",
      "",
      "Fat lot of good topping this list after the first three games did Trafford. This is likely to be his number for the rest of the season unless Gianluigi Donnarumma suffers a misfortune.",
      "",
      "Sunderland fans have been raving about Roefs after his start to life on Wearside and everyone else is starting to see what the fuss is about. A slight fall here after conceding two to Arsenal. Leandro Trossard’s rocket was unstoppable, but Roefs never quite got himself in the right shape to deal better with Bukayo Saka’s leveller. He retains the highest saves percentage in the league, though.",
      "",
      "Lammens continues to dazzle United fans with simple competency. The Belgian made a couple of fine saves at Spurs and could do little to stop either of the hosts’ goals.",
      "",
      "A first clean sheet in seven sees Pickford climb here. The England keeper just needs to avoid a crash in form to cruise into the World Cup as Tuchel’s No.1.",
      "",
      "Verbruggen’s rotten record last season didn’t stop him once again being linked with the likes of Bayern Munich in the summer. In recent weeks, he’s looked more like a goalkeeper who might catch the eye of the big boys after a shakier start to the season.",
      "",
      "Still only David Raya has kept more clean sheets than Pope whose England recall has been scuppered by a concussion suffered at Brentford.",
      "",

      "",
      "One of the biggest climbers in recent weeks. Conceded six over trips to Brighton and Forest but the combined PSxG was 7.9.",
      "",
      "Life is rarely quiet when Martinez has the mitts on. He began the season well, then tailed off quite alarmingly, but a clean sheet and a penalty save against Bournemouth was more like it.",
      "",
      "Johnstone has been more reliable than Jose Sa but Sunderland’s opener cut the ex-England keeper in half; Burnley’s first took him by surprise; and he might feel he could have kept out the first of Fulham’s three. Harsh? Probably. At Chelsea, he was powerless to stop any of the Blues’ three second-half goals.",
      "",
      "The Liverpool keeper enhanced his standing in this metric during his last Prem appearance at Palace – not that it did Liverpool much good in the first of their four consecutive Premier League defeats – before feeling a twang in the next game at Galatasaray.",
      "",
      "Raya faced more shots on his target at Sunderland than the previous four games combined. He kept out neither of them. No biggie for Dan Ballard’s opener, but the Black Cats’ late leveller would have been prevented had Raya not rushed from his goal.",
      "",
      "It almost doesn’t matter what Sanchez does, everyone has already decided that Chelsea need an upgrade. And they are probably correct. There is a keeper at the club who might do a job.",
      "",
      "Prior to a comparatively comfortable outing against Leeds, last season’s joint winner of the Golden Glove award had a wretched few weeks, falling 13 places in this list, from a position of strength to somewhere a lot less competent. Conceding direct from a corner against Bournemouth and then from around 30 yards didn’t help his cause. Little Sels could do about either of Manchester United’s goals but Big John is still breathing down his neck.",
      "",

      "Darlow replaced Lucas Perri after the Brazilian sustained an injury and the stand-in’s form kept him in Daniel Farke’s XI. But Spurs and Burnley scoring four goals from an xG of 1.05 was not a good look on Darlow.",

There have been goals for which the big Georgian was beaten rather easily so a clean sheet against Villa was much-needed for his confidence.

      "Cristiano Ronaldo delivered a damning verdict of Man Utd's current squad saying Ruben Amorim cannot work \"miracles\"; Man Utd are on a run of four unbeaten as they travel to Spurs on Saturday in a first meeting since their Europa League final loss",
      "Thursday 6 November 2025 14:47, UK",
      "Manchester United boss Ruben Amorim has urged people to \"forget\" the past after Cristiano Ronaldo's scathing criticism of the club.",
      "Ronaldo delivered a damning verdict of United's current squad and suggested Amorim cannot perform \"miracles\" at Old Trafford.",
      "In another interview on Piers Morgan Uncensored, after his 2022 sitdown led to the premature end of his second spell at United, Ronaldo said: \"He's [Amorim] doing his best. What are you gonna do? Miracles? Miracles are impossible. We say in Portugal, miracles are only in Fatima.",
      "\"You're not gonna do miracles. Even the players. Manchester United have good players, but then some of them don't have the mind what is Manchester United?\"",
      "Asked about Ronaldo's comments, Amorim suggested that, despite Ronaldo knowing full well the impact that his words can have and mistakes in the past, improvements are being made at Old Trafford.",
      "\"He knows he has a huge impact in everything he says,\" Amorim said at his press conference.",
      "\"What we need to do is focus on the future. We know that we, as a club, made a lot of mistakes in the past, but we are trying to change that. So let's not focus on what happened.",
      "\"Let's focus on what we are doing now, and we are doing that. We are changing a lot of things in the structure, the way we do things, that we want the players to behave. We are doing that, and we are improving.",
      "\"So let's focus on the way we are doing things; we are improving. Let's continue and forget a little bit [about] the past.\"",
      "Amorim was facing the media ahead of United's trip to Tottenham on Saturday lunchtime. It's the first time United will have met Spurs since a sobering 1-0 Europa League final defeat in May.",
      "A win for Amorim's side, who have shown an upturn in form on a current run of four without defeat, will see them move into second place in the Premier League. Amorim believes he will take a better United team to Tottenham than the one that lost to Spurs in Bilbao. Asked about the differences in his current side, Amorim said:",
      "\"First of all, the characteristics of the players. We have different characteristics in our team. We also have a lot of players who played last year, so we are a better team. We play better. We understand the game better.",
      "\"I think we are more confident. We reached that final confident that we could win because we were doing well in Europe. But in this moment, we play with a different confidence.",
      "\"We manage the moments of the game better. But if you remember that game, they have that shot on the goal; they won the game. So I expect a different game, that we can play better, but also to have a little bit of luck to help us to win the game.",
      "\"We believe more that we can win any game, and we already proved that we can win any game. The last game [at Nottingham Forest] was tough on us, because in some moments, we were not the team that we were supposed to be in every minute.",
      "\"And compare that to Brighton, and we suffer two goals against Brighton, but was a different thing. So we know that we cannot forget that we have a lot to improve.",
      "\"We are more prepared for anything that happens in the game, so that is also a good thing. So we are in a better moment, but we also know that we have a lot to do, a lot to improve, to be able to win more of this kind of game, and consistently win games in a row.",
      "\"So we know that we are capable, we are confident, but we also know that we struggle sometimes in games that we need to do better.\"",
      "Defeat in May and a 15th-place finish meant that United missed out on a place in this season's Champions League, while Spurs, who finished 17th, qualified for the competition.",
      "Despite a lack of European football for just the second time in Premier League history, Amorim maintains he sees the positives of the loss in the final.",
      "\"It's not the fact of seeing the positive is using the positives. So any situation that you have in your life, you can look in a positive way or in a bad way. If you ask me, you prefer to be here with a cup in the Champions League.",
      "\"Champions League, more money, more players? Maybe, of course, I will say yes, but you have the other side. You have more time to train, to know your players, to arrange everything, the connection between staff and to prepare the future.",
      "\"In the future will be with European competition. So we just tried to use the positive thing of not playing all the games during the week. So yes, I can see the positives.\"",

      "Casemiro is in the final year of his Manchester United contract, 33 years old and it's fair to admit he's also past his pomp, but he is a crucial cog in Ruben Amorim's midfield.",
      "Of the 20 goals United have conceded this season, five have come when Casemiro was on the pitch. The other 15 goals they've shipped have come without him. That pattern was clear in United's 2-2 draw at Spurs.",
      "Casemiro was taken off with less than 20 minutes to go and United leading through Bryan Mbeumo's first-half header. Spurs then scored twice late on when he left the field.",
      "Casemiro has an undeniable impact on United but Amorim's over-reliance on the Brazil international is a further reflection of the club's need to find an appropriate heir in midfield. United have made signing a new midfielder a priority in the summer, but they might need to accelerate those plans.William Bitibiri",
      "For a team with ambitions of qualifying for next season's Champions League, Tottenham's home form is simply not good enough. No ever-present side has fewer home points in the Premier League in 2025.",
      "That run has continued under Thomas Frank, whose sole league victory this season at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium came on the opening weekend against promoted-side Burnley.",
      "When Richarlison glanced in Wilson Odobert's cross in the first minute of stoppage-time to make it 2-1 against Man Utd, it seemed certain that fact would change.",
      "However, Matthijs de Ligt's 96th-minute equaliser extended Spurs' winless home run in the competition to five.",
      "In spite of these struggles, and a raft of injuries with 10 players out, Spurs are still third in the table. Sorting those home struggles is crucial if Spurs are to be contenders.Zinny Boswell",
      "Good things can't last forever, and in the case of Arsenal, their run of clean sheets came to its conclusion at the Stadium of Light.",
      "A huge 812 minutes after conceding their last goal, Dan Ballard proved it is in fact possible to beat David Raya and reminded the Premier League that the Gunners are not impenetrable.",
      "That does not mean that Mikel Arteta's side are now going to be conceding goals left, right and centre, but it does mean that at the other end they will need to be more clinical.",
      "Arteta will point to the fact that he was without several attacking options. Viktor Gyokeres joined the likes of Kai Havertz, Gabriel Martinelli, Gabriel Jesus and Noni Madueke on the sidelines, but the Gunners still created 17 chances.",
      "Bukayo Saka and Leandro Trossard may have scored, but they also wasted good chances. William Saliba may not be the one you would point at to find the net, but he too will look back on today's game thinking they could have got his name on the scoresheet.",
      "Had another clean sheet been secured, this wouldn't have mattered in the grand scheme of things. But, ultimately, this would be costly.",
      "Saka's quality is not in doubt. Trossard's is underrated. Merino is a serviceable option as a No 9. The weight will continue to fall on them while other players regain their fitness, and their production will get called into question if more nights like this one begin to impact their title charge.Callum Bishop",
      "Admittedly, in the second half, the Black Cats were at the mercy of Arsenal, who looked likely to score with almost every attack. In the first, though, it was a very different tale.",
      "Regis Le Bris' side put in a commanding first 45 minutes. And it wasn't by playing the most beautiful football. It was by forcing their opponents to play the game exactly how they wanted it to be played.",
      "The resolute nature of Sunderland's rearguard performance began to irritate the Gunners, and by the time they conceded they were just playing into the hands of the hosts. Silly free-kicks, rushed decisions in the final third. Yes, they composed themselves after the break, but Sunderland left them rattled.",
      "The fact they were able to do this against a side that could have gone nine points clear at the top of the Premier League had they won, speaks volumes about what the newly promoted side have been able to do. Both tonight and through the season to date.",
      "When people say there are no easy games in the Premier League, Sunderland are the evidence they will continue to point towards.Callum Bishop",
      "Booed off at half-time, given a standing ovation at the final whistle. There was a big mood-shift at Stamford Bridge as Chelsea eventually broken down and then tore apart Wolves.",
      "The Chelsea supporters had been celebrating before kick-off, too, watching Arsenal get pegged back by Sunderland on the TV screens inside the stadium. Those two results, leave Chelsea second in the Premier League title race and just six points off the Gunners.",
      "Are the world champions now Premier League contenders?",
      "That could be the day Chelsea establish serious momentum. Or the day their shortcomings are underlined.",
      "In moments, this is a team so slick and brimming with potential. In others, they look stuck and short of ideas. The return to fitness of Cole Palmer should at least help with their final-third quality but issues at No 9 persist, with Liam Delap and Marc Guiu off the pace right now.",
      "After this third international break of the season, the hard and decisive winter months begin. Chelsea are well placed - just as they were at this stage last season. Can they kick on and go for the crown?Peter Smith",
      "Former Wolves boss Gary O'Neil says the club needs a \"reset\". To stay in the Premier League they'll need a miracle.",
      "Every single top-flight side with two or fewer points at this stage have then been relegated - Man City in 1995-96 (2), Sunderland in 2016-17 (2), Sheffield United in 2020-21 (1) and 2023-24 (1), and Norwich in 2021-22 (2).",
      "The last time Wolves failed to win any of their opening 11 games, in 1983, they were relegated from the top flight. It is near impossible to see how that won't happen again.",
      "Rob Edwards needs to consider very carefully whether it is worth leaving his high-flying Middlesbrough for a side that they could pass on the way up.",
      "Wolves look doomed with their best players sold in the summer and striker Jorgen Strand Larsen struggling for service and form. It won't just be a long winter, but a long season.David Richardson",
      "Even in 20 years time, Tomas Soucek will be scoring goals for West Ham in the Premier League. Probably.",
      "Watching him at West Ham always reminds me on the classic Whac-A-Mole game from the 1990s. Just when you think he has disappeared, out of sight from the first team and with too many whacks on the head to rise again, up he pops to make big contributions for the club.",
      "His role playing as the emergency striker in the final 15 minutes of this crucial clash with Burnley provided the spark that the Hammers were lacking as the game wore on. His legs may not move as quick as they once did but his game intelligence and the nuisance factor he brings certainly remains.",
      "\"Every time Soucek played against me, he was a nightmare,\" said his manager Nuno Espirito Santo, who has to take big credit for utlising Soucek in this role. From his last 44 minutes on the pitch as a striker, the battering ram Czech has scored twice and played a huge role in another goal. You just can't keep him down.Lewis Jones",
      "Everton’s midfield set the tone from the first whistle, with Idrissa Gana Gueye driving the team forward and capping a dominant first half with the opener. His energy and control allowed the Toffees to dictate the tempo and keep Fulham penned in for long spells.",
      "Michael Keane’s late header sealed the points and reflected Everton’s growing confidence under David Moyes. The defender looked assured at the back and dangerous from set-pieces, delivering one of his most complete performances of the season.",
      "For Everton, this felt like a statement of control and composure, a reminder of their growing maturity under Moyes.",
      "Fulham, though, will be left frustrated. They improved after the break, with Josh King and Rodrigo Muniz both forcing saves from Jordan Pickford, but their lack of quality in the final third once again proved their downfall as the pressure grows near the bottom.Sam Cohen",

      "Ruben Amorim was downbeat after Matthijs de Ligt's 96th-minute equaliser salvaged a 2-2 draw for Man Utd at Spurs and extended their unbeaten run in the league to five games, their longest under him, after throwing away another lead and seeing Benjamin Sesko forced off with a knee injury",
      "Saturday 8 November 2025 22:53, UK",
      "Manchester United boss Ruben Amorim said his team \"have a lot of problems\" as he delivered a reality check after the 2-2 draw at Tottenham.",
      "Matthijs de Ligt's 96th-minute equaliser salvaged a point for United to extend their unbeaten league run to five games, their longest under the Portuguese, but Amorim was frustrated to see his side repeat the mistakes of last Saturday's draw at Nottingham Forest.",
      "United led for nearly an hour through Bryan Mbeumo's first-half header, but late goals from Spurs substitute Mathys Tel and Richarlison, seven minutes apart, turned the game before De Ligt rescued a draw with his side a player down after Benjamin Sesko's injury.",
      "Amorim said United, who would have gone second had they held on to win, struggled to cope when he took Casemiro and Harry Maguire off with less than 20 minutes to go as he struck a downbeat tone ahead of the international break.",
      "\"We have a lot of problems,\" said Amorim. \"We are just in the beginning. I know that sometimes the results show to people that we are improving, but we have a lot to do.",
      "\"You can divide the game in the final 10 minutes, also when we have to take out Harry Maguire and Casemiro at the same time, then suffer two goals, then losing [Sesko], even before the second goal with a big opportunity.",
      "\"To play with 10 men, but then to overcome everything and to manage to score, is a good thing, but if you look at the rest of the game, we were comfortable.",
      "\"I think we should do better, be more aggressive, feeling the environment in the stadium.",
      "\"The three points were there, the space was there, and I think we felt too comfortable during the game, and we need to expect that in one play anything can happen and change the mood of the stadium, and today was that.",
      "\"We controlled the game well, but we need to do better, because the game was there for the taking.\"",
      "Sesko, who was dropped from the starting line-up at Spurs, was forced off with a knee injury coming off the bench and could miss Slovenia's World Cup qualifiers.",
      "The striker had a chance to put United in front shortly after Tel's late equaliser for 1-1 but let the opportunity pass him by, taking too long to shoot before Micky van de Ven recovered, picking up the injury in the process.",
      "That was Sesko's last act as he headed straight down the tunnel with the medical team, who will assess the severity of his problem, which was enough to stop him playing on despite United having used all five of their subs.",
      "Asked about Sesko being low on confidence, Amorim said: \"No, I think that is not the biggest concern now. That happened in the same way that he was not scoring and then he scored two goals in the next two games.",
      "\"That happens, especially with a striker. I'm more concerned with his injury because it's in the knee and I don't know [how bad it is]. We need Ben to be a better team.\"",
      "Asked if it is a serious injury, he added: \"I have no idea, but because it's the knee, we never know.\"",
      "United are already set to lose Bryan Mbeumo, Amad Diallo and Noussair Mazraoui to AFCON, which begins on December 21 and ends on January 18, and a serious injury to Sesko would leave Amorim in a precarious position.",
      "Joshua Zirkzee, who Amorim does not view as a No 9, was the only senior striking option on the bench at Spurs and was an unused substitute, with Mason Mount preferred as an impact player.",
      "Asked if they will be active in the January window, Amorim said: \"We have to check everything, we have to check what's happened with Ben.",
      "\"Of course we are going to have a problem [with AFCON], but we already knew [that]. Managing that situation is going to be hard, but let's see when the window is open if we can improve the team and try to repair something. Until then, we have to take the chance.\"",
      "Asked if he wants to make January signings, Amorim added: \"We'll see.\"",
      "But the numbers show that those plans might have to be brought forward to the January window if, of course, PSR will allow.",
      "Casemiro, 33 and in the final year of his deal at Old Trafford, cannot be relied on to hold everything together for the whole season and clearly the other options are not up to the job.",
      "Of the 20 goals United have conceded this season, only five have come when Casemiro is on the pitch, which means the other 15 have come in his absence.",
      "That will surely be a huge concern for Amorim, who has only used the Brazilian for the full 90 once this season. He needs to find Casemiro's heir and fast.",

      "Manchester United are on a run of four matches without defeat and for director of football Jason Wilcox, it's a reflection of the positive work slowly being achieved at Old Trafford; Wilcox outlines how the club's hierarchy work with head coach Ruben Amorim to navigate transfers",
      "Thursday 6 November 2025 08:48, UK",
      "Manchester United director of football Jason Wilcox has shed further light on how the club intend to navigate future transfer windows and why there are signs of progress at Old Trafford.",
      "United's recent upturn in form has seen Ruben Amorim begin an impressive run of four matches without defeat - a spell that included a three-match winning run in the Premier League, which was the first time the club had achieved the feat under him.",
      "The Portuguese coach saw his side earn a draw late on at Nottingham Forest to mark his first year at United. After a turbulent 12 months for Amorim and signs seemingly pointing towards the turning of a corner at Old Trafford, what have we learnt from Wilcox's assessment of United and their vision for the future?",
      "United's form has picked up. Last season, a record-low finish of 15th place in the Premier League did very little to inspire confidence at Old Trafford going into the new season.",
      "However, following a summer of change in the playing squad, at the moment, there are green shoots that suggest things are moving in the right direction.",
      "United are currently eighth in the Premier League, in touch of the top five positions that could secure United a return to Europe. Amorim's side can go second in the Premier League if they beat Tottenham in their Saturday lunchtime meeting.",
      "\"The most important thing is internally, we know what we need to do,\" Wilcox told Manchester United's official channels.",
      "\"We know where we are as a group. The players understand that and we are making progress on and off the pitch.",
      "\"I spoke last week to MUTV, and when I say we're making progress with our processes, the facilities, the structures and the staff - what we've got to do is, despite all the noise, we just have to remain calm, understand that we're moving in a positive direction.",
      "\"We are going to have bumps in the road, and it's important that we just smooth out the bumps and don't get overexcited and too disappointed.",
      "\"I really feel now this football club is moving in the right direction. That's my own personal view. That's not a biased view because I'm working here.",
      "\"When I think about the sporting department, we are making progress in every single area.\"",
      "In an interview aired on Tuesday, Cristiano Ronaldo gave a scathing review of United's current identity and lack of structure. Amorim, too, has received a fair share of scrutiny for his perceived rigid 3-4-3 system. However, Wilcox disagrees and believes the current work being done is helping to establish United's identity and game model.",
      "\"We've just got to continue to build the spirit,\" Wilcox said.",
      "\"Continue to build on Ruben's idea. He's got a very clear idea. It's a lot more flexible than people give him credit for.",
      "\"We've got to start with the end in mind and understand the game model, how Manchester United are, is really important.",
      "\"And we have to pull the jigsaw together. We would love to have all the pieces in place where we can see a very clear picture.",
      "\"But while we're building the picture, it's really important. It's even more difficult when you lose some football matches, because people start questioning things. But we're really clear, myself, Ruben, Omar [Berrada] and the ownership. We're really clear on the direction of travel. And this is really important.\"",
      "Transfers have been a mystery at Old Trafford for many years. While United have always been active in windows, the opaque nature of United's transfer strategy has opened the door for criticism for supposed slow dealings and reported missed targets.",
      "However, Wilcox lifted the lid on how United's hierarchy work with head coach Amorim to navigate transfers.",
      "\"The brief will come from me and Ruben,\" Wilcox said.",
      "\"It goes into Chris [Vivell], a lot of debate and discussion around the profiles of what we need, and then the scouts will go into the market.",
      "\"We'll combine that with the data team, and they'll just be in a constant dialogue. Right now, I'm having weekly meetings with the recruitment team on the different profiles.",
      "\"The different age brackets, the costs, are they attainable with Ruben as well. So it's a real joined-up approach.",
      "\"When we sign a player, there are so many people that are involved in the process, the data team are involved in the process.",
      "\"We will then focus all our attention on certain players. And it's really important then that we do the background checks around.",
      "\"Are they clean-living professionals? This is really important. This year we looked at Premier League-ready players.",
      "\"Certainly with Bryan [Mbeumo] and Matheus [Cunha], we couldn't take too much risk in this area.",
      "\"We needed players that we could plug in and play with little transition time. Senne [Lammens], we were always looking at goalkeepers who have got huge potential, and Senne was available. We decided to move but it wasn't a knee-jerk reaction.",
      "\"Tony Cotton [Man Utd goalkeeper scout] was putting Senne on my radar 12 months ago and he was relentless with it.",
      "\"'This guy is going to be a top signing for us. And he's started well, but he's got to keep it going. He's very reflective and he's very professional in his approach.\"",
      "Summer signings Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Senne Lammens have played their role in United's upturn in form, with fans impressed with not only their performances but their attitude.",
      "United's recent transfer success is a trend that Wilcox suggests will continue at Old Trafford as the club aim to re-establish themselves at the top of the Premier League, as well as being capable of competing in Europe.",
      "\"We have got a clear plan,\" Wilcox told the United website.",
      "\"We know what we have got to do, we know the areas of the team that we have got to improve.",
      "\"For us to get in the top four and consistently challenge for Champions League places, win Champions League, win Premier League, we have got to invest in the squad.",
      "\"We have got to buy the right players. The right players who are talented but also who can deal with the pressure, who can take the squad forward. It is not always about just signing elite talent; they have got to have the right character and be somebody who can bring something different to the team.\"",

      "Cristiano Ronaldo left Manchester United after his second spell came to a sour end following a bombshell interview in 2022; the Al Nassr forward says, despite an upturn in form at Old Trafford the Premier League club is not on the right path and needs to change",
      "Wednesday 5 November 2025 15:01, UK",
      "Cristiano Ronaldo says Manchester United boss Ruben Amorim cannot work miracles at Old Trafford and has revealed the sadness he feels for his former club.",
      "Amorim managed to steer his United side to three wins in a row for the first time since taking over at Old Trafford before Saturday's 2-2 draw at Nottingham Forest marked his one-year anniversary at the club.",
      "It has been a turbulent year for the Portuguese coach as Manchester United recorded their worst Premier League finish last season in 15th, as well as ending the campaign trophyless, having lost the Europa League final and therefore missing out on Europe for this season.",
      "While United have shown positive signs recently, Ronaldo still has reservations over the club's current situation.",
      "\"He's [Amorim] doing his best,\" said Ronaldo, speaking on Piers Morgan Uncensored.",
      "\"What are you gonna do? Miracles? Miracles are impossible. We say in Portugal, miracles are only in Fatima.",
      "\"You're not gonna do miracles. Even the players. Manchester United have good players, but then some of them don't have the mind, what is Manchester United.\"",
      "The Al Nassr forward was speaking to Morgan three years on from his bombshell interview that ultimately brought his second spell at Old Trafford to a sour end. In 2022, Ronaldo infamously criticised the club's hierarchy, then head coach Erik ten Hag and slammed the club's facilities, leading to his transfer to the Saudi Pro League.",
      "Despite his public views on United, Ronaldo said he maintains his love for the club he represented 346 times over his two spells, scoring 145 goals. However, the five-time Ballon d'Or winner suggests the club must still find a working structure.",
      "\"I'm sad, because the club is one of the most important clubs in the world - and a club that I still have in my heart - because of the obvious reasons you have to follow with intelligent people, smart people, to create a base for the future as Manchester United.",
      "\"So many years ago, Nicky Butt, Gary Neville, Roy Keane, [David] Beckham, they became big players, but they had youth.",
      "\"So Manchester United right now, they don't have a structure. I hope that changes in the present-future, because the potential of the club is amazing. It's one of the most important clubs of the century.\"",
      "Ronaldo first signed for United in 2003, teeing up a legendary career that would see him win his first Ballon d'Or and first of five Champions Leagues while at Old Trafford.",
      "The now-40-year-old would also win three league titles at United before completing a then-world-record transfer to Real Madrid in 2009. The Portugal captain returned in dramatic fashion in 2021 under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer but, despite his 27 goals in 54 games upon his return, his comeback is largely viewed as being unsuccessful.",
      "Asked if he still keeps up with United's results and whether they bring him sadness, Ronaldo said: \"Of course, because I was a player there. So many, many years ago, I won the Champions League there.",
      "\"I win the Golden Ball. I won like 12, 13, 14 titles there. So, as I say, and I repeat, Manchester United are still in my heart; I love that club.",
      "\"But we have all to be honest and look for ourselves and say, listen, they are not on a good path, so they need to change. And it's not only about the coach and players, in my opinion.\"",
      "Ronaldo, who turns 41 in February, also revealed he is planning to retire \"soon\" and predicts he \"probably will cry\" when the time comes.",
      "The Al Nassr and Portugal forward has scored 952 goals in his career so far and is targeting 1,000 goals before he hangs up his boots.",
      "Asked when he might consider retiring, Ronaldo replied: \"Soon. But I think I will be prepared.",
      "\"It will be tough, of course. I probably will cry, yes... I'm an open person. It will be very, very difficult, yes.",
      "\"But, I have prepared my future since [the age of] 25, 26, 27 years old. I think I will be capable to support that pressure.\"",
      "Gary Neville believes Manchester United's experienced players \"should be doing a lot better\" to help carry Amorim's side.",
      "Speaking on The Overlap and Betfair's Stick to Cricket, Neville said: \"I think your spine of a football team is critical. When I first came into Man Utd, our spine was [Peter] Schmeichel, [Steve] Bruce, [Gary] Pallister, [Roy] Keane and [Eric] Cantona and so we were all scattered around it.",
      "\"I think [Harry] Maguire and [Matthijs] De Ligt should be doing a lot better than they are. You look at the experience that those two have got.",
      "\"De Ligt's played a mountain of games at the highest level. Harry's played so many times for England. You've got the midfield, Casemiro and Bruno [Fernandes] have got massive experience.",
      "\"Up front, they haven't got the experience. But to me, that spine of Bruno, Casemiro, Maguire and De Ligt is ageing, but should be doing a lot better at holding it all together than they do.",
      "\"That's why I think Liverpool are good because they've got Alisson, Van Dijk, they've got Mac Allister and Gravenberch in midfield and then they've got obviously the centre-forwards that they've got.\""

      "As Real Madrid defender Alvaro Carreras prepares to mark Mohamed Salah against Liverpool on Tuesday evening, Adam Bate speaks to the player's former coach at Preston North End to discuss a remarkable rise for the ex-Manchester United reserve...",
      "Tuesday 4 November 2025 21:24, UK",
      "Alvaro Carreras has been a revelation at Real Madrid. After pocketing Lamine Yamal in El Clasico, the left-back blasted home his first Madrid goal against Valencia on Saturday evening. Why on earth did Manchester United allow him to leave Old Trafford?",
      "As he makes his return to the North West of England for Real Madrid's Champions League game against Liverpool on Tuesday night, it is Carreras rather than Trent Alexander-Arnold who looks the pick of the club's new signings under Xabi Alonso.",
      "Having blossomed at Benfica, the 22-year-old already appears a bargain buy - even at the £43m fee that Madrid paid for him. It all seems a little strange when United were muddling through with Sergio Reguilon and Sofyan Amrabat at left-back not long ago.",
      "Gallagher was first-team coach at Preston throughout the 2022/23 Championship season for which Carreras was named as the club's young player of the year, having been United's reserve-team player of the year in the preceding season. He developed at Deepdale.",
      "\"Straight away, you could see real quality in his game,\" recalls Gallagher. \"We played him as a left wing back, but you could see he was very comfortable on the ball. He got people off their seats from left wing-back with his dribbling skills and his passing skills.\"",
      "He adds: \"Technically, he is very good. But he has got an unbelievable mentality as well in that he wants to learn. First and foremost, he is a really good kid with a nice personality, very respectful. That stood out because he had to learn quickly at Preston.",
      "\"In the Championship, it is tough. You have to be robust, you have to win your duels. That is something that he showed because when the going got tough, to be fair to him, as well as all the quality, he would roll his sleeves up and have a real good go too.\"",
      "Preston boss Ryan Lowe had to manage his minutes, benching him for both games against Millwall, for example, letting him acclimatise. \"Sometimes you need to do that with young players, take them in and out. It was his first loan too,\" explains Gallagher.",
      "\"That might have been the moment that the penny dropped for him but he was never afraid to get stuck in. He got a few kicks that season but he just got on with it and the Preston fans loved him for it. He was going into tackles and coming out with the ball.\"",
      "Carreras is now taking that approach into the Champions League. Against Juventus recently, he won all 11 of his duels in a 1-0 win at the Bernabeu, becoming the first defender to win that many duels without losing one in the competition in over a decade.",
      "Gallagher wanted to take Carreras on loan to Stoke the following season but the player had lined up a move to LaLiga with Granada before being permitted to depart United permanently for Benfica in January of last year. Madrid came calling in the summer.",
      "It was the chance for Carreras to return to the Spanish giants, having been part of the academy in Madrid prior to signing a four-year deal with United at the age of 17. Gallagher was among the first to text his former player congratulating him on the move.",
      "\"One thing with Alvaro and his personality, he will really believe in his ability. He will probably have thought he was good enough to play for Manchester United long ago and he was brave enough to go and prove it. Now he has his dream move to Real Madrid.",
      "\"It is not a surprise to me that he is doing so well now. What I always say about the best young players is that you only have to tell them once and that was true of Alvaro. When it sticks with a young player first time then you just know that they are going to the top.",
      "\"His attitude was fantastic. He wanted to learn, do the extras after training and to develop. He wants to be play at the highest level and he will soon be playing for the Spain national team, going to World Cups and stuff like that, because he is that good.\"",
      "Indeed, he has already shown himself to be an asset for Madrid in both defence and attack this season. His eye-catching display when given the daunting task of marking Yamal against Barcelona quashed any lingering doubts about his defensive acumen.",
      "\"Alvaro would have relished that too,\" says Gallagher. \"He would have gone into that game thinking about coming out the other end of it believing that he is the best full-back in the world.\" Next time out against Valencia, he won a penalty and smashed in a stunning goal.",
      "\"He has good quality to create in the final third. He is a modern-day full-back but he has also got that thing where he will work so hard to get back and help the team. Preston fans loved that about him but all coaches and fans take to someone like that.",
      "\"He plays with that personality, energy and belief in himself. It is not overconfidence but just belief in his own ability. It is why he is at one of the best clubs in the world.\" A triumph for the exceptional Alvaro Carreras, somehow overlooked at Manchester United.",
