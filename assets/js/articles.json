      "Manchester United have been told their goalkeeping problems could last for several more years after failing to sign an experienced No. 1 this summer. Andre Onana was the Red Devils' first-choice keeper for the last two seasons, but constant errors saw him given permission to join Turkish side Trabzonspor on loan late in the most recent transfer window.",
      "United were linked with a number of seasoned shot-stoppers as they eyed a replacement, including Emi Martinez and Gianluigi Donnarumma. However, a move for Martinez failed to materialise and he ended up staying at Aston Villa, while Donnarumma made the switch from Paris Saint-Germain to join United's fierce rivals Manchester City.",
      "A new goalkeeper was eventually welcomed at Old Trafford after an £18m deal was agreed for Royal Antwerp's Senne Lammens. The 23-year-old was handed his debut by United head coach Ruben Amorim just before the international break, keeping a clean sheet in their 2-0 win over Sunderland in the Premier League.",
      "But doubts persist over whether Lammens is the answer to their woes between the sticks given his lack of experience outside the Belgian Pro League. Former United keeper Ben Foster has now voiced his astonishment that they didn't try harder to sign Martinez or Donnarumma.",
      "Speaking on talkSPORT, the ex-Watford and Wrexham star said: \"I was really shocked [that they didn't sign Martinez]. I thought it was an absolute no-brainer. Even with Gigi Donnarumma, I thought it's a no-brainer so just get it done.",
      "\"You need that guy. You might have to pay over the odds for him and you might have to pay a heavy wage, but that position is then settled.",
      "\"They didn't do it and I think it could become a situation where it might just rumble on for a few years now. I'm willing to give Lammens a chance because he got off to a fantastic start against Sunderland but it's a big ask.\"",
      "Onana is currently enjoying happier times following his temporary move away from United and an improvement in performances in Turkey. However, Foster insists Amorim was right to let the former Inter Milan keeper leave, despite questioning his choice of replacement.",
      "He said: \"When you make the amount of mistakes that he made, then it's inevitable that eventually you're going to get turfed out. It's just the way that it goes. He's probably a little bit too hectic as a goalkeeper.",
      "\"None of it is calm and composed and in big moments, there were saves that he was making that just looked a little bit too erratic. It's like he would panic in those moments.",
      "\"They're the moments where you need real calmness under pressure, when the ball is coming at you at 80 miles per hour. He didn't have that ability and I thought he let the pressure get to him a little bit too much.\"",
      "Trabzonspor are understood to be exploring the possibility of signing Onana on a permanent basis. His intention though is believed to be to make a return to Manchester in the hope of re-establishing himself as United's No 1.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Manchester United travel to Anfield today for a battle with their fierce rivals Liverpool - and Ruben Amorim has a few headaches to contend with. The Red Devils head to Merseyside having endured a poor start to the season.",
      "While they managed to get back on track against Sunderland before the international break, the Premier League champions represent United's biggest challenge so far. And given the opponents, boss Amorim will certainly want to have all his best players available.",
      "That might be easier said than done, with United having sustained a few injury issues so far this season, while a host of players missed training ahead of the weekend’s trip to Anfield.",
      "Captain Bruno Fernandes was one of those to be absent after international, while summer signing Matheus Cunha was also sidelined. They were joined away from training by Amad and Casemiro.",
      "Starting in goal, summer addition Senne Lammens appears to now be United’s number one and he should start once again against Liverpool. Moving into defence, Amorim will no doubt deploy his back-three of Luke Shaw, Matthijs de Ligt and Leny Yoro.",
      "Lisandro Martinez - who has been out with a long-term knee injury - is closing in on a return but is not quite ready to play yet. Meanwhile, Amorim hinted that Noussair Mazraoui could miss out.",
      "Diogo Dalot and Amad should be stationed on either flank. Patrick Dorgu is another option, but despite missing training on Thursday, Amad should get the nod to start.",
      "And while Bruno Fernandes and Casemiro both had limited training time ahead of this weekend’s game, they are both highly likely to be in the side if they are fit enough. Moving into attack, United’s frontline should have a relatively familiar look.",
      "Benjamin Sesko will lead the line over Joshua Zirkzee and will be supported by fellow summer arrival Bryan Mbeumo. The final decision that Amorim has to make is over whether to play Matheus Cunha or Mason Mount.",
      "Given the ex-Chelsea man netted against Sunderland last time out, Amorim might feel that he has done enough to retain his spot in the side. Cunha was among those to have missed training in the build-up to the game so may have to make do with a place among the substitutes.",
      "Giving an update on his side’s fitness, Amorim said: “Licha is not available. Near but he is just returning. I don't know about Mazraoui. The international players are ready but we need to give them more time. The guys who are returning are ready to play.”",
      "Man Utd predicted XI vs Liverpool: Lammens; Shaw, De Ligt, Yoro; Dalot, Fernandes, Casemiro, Amad; Mount, Mbeumo, Sesko.",
      "Fanatics has slashed the price of football kits and merch from Premier League clubs including Man United, Man City, Liverpool, Everton, Arsenal, Spurs and more.",

      "Up next for Manchester United in the Premier League is a date with Liverpool, in one of the biggest rivalries in world football. Liverpool started the season with seven straight wins in all competitions, but that seems a long time ago now after they racked up three defeats on the bounce before the international break.",
      "Ruben Amorim's United have been inconsistent this far, languishing in the middle of the table with three wins to their name in the Premier League. However, with such a big game on the horizon, a win for either side could be a catalyst to properly get the ball rolling.",
      "A former coach of Senne Lammens says he could become the best goalkeeper in the world and has identified the behaviour which exemplifies him as a professional.",
      "The young Belgian shot-stopper penned a deal with United during the summer alongside the likes of Bryan Mbeumo, Benjamin Sesko and more.",
      "When he arrived to sign the contract, he was dressed in a simple navy sweatshirt and polo - a very rare sight in the modern game, when huge salaries are often coupled with designer clothes and a generally more luxurious taste in attire. He kept it simple on international duty, wearing a beige collared jacket, a khaki t-shirt and chinos.",
      "\"By accident, I saw an article saying he was wearing something boring when he reported for international duty and fans saying they hoped he stays like this,\" said former coach Hayk Milkon.",
      "\"This 'boringness' is just the way Senne is, he's really calm and no excesses. He focuses on what he needs to focus on and is open with the people around him. He keeps his feet on the ground.\"",
      "Fanatics has slashed the price of football kits and merch from Premier League clubs including Man United, Man City, Liverpool, Everton, Arsenal, Spurs and more.",
      "Following these comments, he suggested Lammens could become the very best: \"I was not surprised when I saw Manchester United had come calling. And to record his first clean sheet, I was really happy for him. Senne is a potential No.1 for the Red Devils - the Belgium national team.",
      "\"He got his chance, he took it and we're all really proud of him, but we knew it would happen. I believe he has all the capabilities to become the best in the world, so I wish him all the best. I'm sure he will have a very good career in England and Manchester United should return to the big club they used to be.\"",
      "Rik de Mil, head coach of Club NXT when Lammens first broke through, offers a similar tale about his behaviour on the training field. The pair also worked together at Club Brugge, when De Mil spotted Lammens' work ethic. After working late at the training ground, De Mil noticed the goalkeeper returning to the gym alone for a late-night training session.",
      "He said: \"He had been sitting at home, thinking I’m doing nothing here, so I’ll go back to the training ground and I'll be all alone there in the gym. He added: \"We always talked about keeping that balance of pushing and being ambitious, but at the same time, sometimes giving yourself a break. He put a lot of pressure on himself.\"",
      "Paul Scholes has identified Casemiro, Luke Shaw and Harry Maguire as three players who can't cope with Premier League football.",
      "The trio are all aged above 30 and United are in need of further squad rejuvenation in the coming windows, with the likes of Adam Wharton and Carlos Baleba being touted as potential replacements for Casemiro, who is heading for the exit door in 2026.",
      "Scholes told The Times: \"Shaw, Maguire, Casemiro, they’ve all been great players but they’re at a stage of their career now where you get found out in the Premier League if you’re not physically good enough.",
      "\"Their bodies are not athletic enough, they’re not strong enough, they’re not quick enough. They’ve dropped to a level where they can’t cope with what’s needed in the Premier League.",
      "\"Every player in the Premier League is an absolute machine. They’ve got five per cent body fat, they can run, they’re strong, they can head it. Manchester United are carrying two or three players that are just not capable of living with it.\"",
      "United centre-back Matthijs de Ligt has defended his manager after the latter received criticism for his system. The Portuguese manager has received negative feedback for his 3-4-2-1 formation, with the Red Devils sitting in mid-table despite a summer of splashing the cash.",
      "Wayne Rooney and Scholes have previously criticised Amorim's tactical approach, while Gary Neville launched a rant about the manager after the loss to Brentford.",
      "Speaking to The Telegraph, De Ligt chose to defend his boss: \"We’re improving as a team. In modern football even if you play a back four almost all teams play by building with three defenders. And we do often defend with four defenders.",
      "\"It’s always easy to say ‘system this, system that’. But, in the end, it’s always adaptable in the game. There’s no situation where the system is always the same in the game. In that way of being flexible and in the structure we have to find a way to get everything right and make everything happen.\"",

      "Antony has revealed how close he was to joining Liverpool before his £82million move to Manchester United. The Brazilian winger headed to Old Trafford in 2022 after two successful seasons at Ajax, winning two league titles and an Olympic gold medal with his national team.",
      "Antony linked up with former boss Erik ten Hag at United, claiming at the time that the Dutchman \"brings out the best in me\". However after a £21.6m move to Real Betis in the summer, the 25-year-old told ESPN Brazil that he was originally planning to head to United's rivals Liverpool instead.",
      "Antony said: \"Before closing with United, I was very close to Liverpool. But the path was meant to be what it was.\" Although we'll never know, things might've turned out differently for the Brazilian in the Premier League had he moved to Anfield.",
      "Despite promising flourishes, Antony failed to hit the ground running at Old Trafford. He managed just 12 goals and five assists in 96 appearances for the Red Devils and was eventually included as part of United's exiled 'bomb squad' in the summer.",
      "Alongside the likes of Jadon Sancho, Marcus Rashford and Alejandro Garnacho, Antony was forced to train away from the rest of the first-team as the club worked to sell him. He eventually departed United and joined Real Betis on a permanent move - for £60m less than his original fee paid by the Old Trafford hierarchy.",
      "The Brazilian admitted his struggles throughout this summer after being snubbed by the club and revealed how he was kept from the first-team as he tried to fashion a move out of England. Antony said: \"I reported back on July 14 and trained separately for more than a month. It was very complicated.",
      "\"For more than 40 days we stayed in hotels. Me and my father were there, waiting. I trained at five in the afternoon while the group trained in the morning.\"",
      "He added: \"I felt there was a lack of respect, even a lack of education. Nobody said good morning or good afternoon. Not even that.",
      "\"It was a moment to test myself, to believe. I knew that something good would happen, even if doubts crossed my mind.\"",
      "When reflecting on his attitude during the exile at United, Antony said: \"Maybe if I had exploded right away, I might have lost myself later. It was necessary to go through that process. Today I feel like a better man, a better father.\"",
      "Antony has started promisingly for Real Betis, scoring once and providing one assist in his first five appearances. Both of those goal contributions came in the Europa League as Betis drew 2-2 against Nottingham Forest last month.",

      "Footage appeared to show a group of men running onto the pitch during the League Two clash, causing the match to be stopped. They appeared to be wearing white hoodies with the message \"Gary Neville is a Traitor\" emblazoned on the back while also carrying England flags - one of the accused also seemingly tried to plant the England flag in the middle of the pitch",
      "They were quickly dragged off the pitch by security, who dealt with them while the game was paused. Neville is a co-owner of Salford and recently completed a substantial takeover of the club as part of a new consortium also featuring David Beckham.",
      "The protest comes amid immense criticism being aimed at Neville, after the ex-United skipper revealed he ordered a Union Jack flag hung on one of his housing developments sites to be taken down, at a time when numerous England and Great Britain flags were being tied to lampposts and painted on mini roundabouts,",
      "At the start of the month, in a video where he explained the exchange, the Manchester United legend said: \"Seeing the news last night and the news this morning dominated by the horrific attacks within the Jewish community just a mile from here.",
      "\"When I was driving to Salford City last night, going down Littleton Road, seeing probably 50 or 60 Union Jack flags. And on the way back I went down the parallel road, Bury New Road, which has got the Jewish community right at its heart, and they're out on the streets, defiant, not hiding or in fear.",

      "It's been 25 years since Ramon Calliste arrived at Manchester United with the world seemingly at his feet, a 15-year-old Welsh forward who, despite his tender age, was already earning comparisons to countryman Ryan Giggs.",
      "Brought to the club by Sir Alex Ferguson, he trained with the likes of David Beckham, Wayne Rooney and Cristiano Ronaldo, with big things expected of the Cardiff-born prodigy, who was even named in a list of the top 100 young players in world football just a year after joining United.",
      "However, while he would taste some glory during his time with the Red Devils, winning the FA Youth Cup with the club in 2003, it never worked out for the highly-rated Calliste in Manchester as he was released in 2005, having never made an appearance for the senior side.",
      "In an incredibly rare move, the then-19-year-old joined arch rivals Liverpool soon after leaving United, becoming the first player since the 1960s to move directly from Old Trafford to Anfield. He would go on to become the Reds' reserve side's top goal scorer during the 2005/06 campaign having joined on a one-year contract.",
      "However, again, a frustrated Calliste couldn't break through to the senior team and after a year of reserve football, joined Scunthorpe in 2006 for the chance of first-team action. But disaster would strike just weeks after joining, as he suffered a serious injury during pre-season, dislocating his ankle, cracking a bone and severely damaging ligaments.",
      "Despite undergoing several operations and initially being told he would be back playing within six months, the horror injury left him with a limp that he had for three years, while he still feels the effect of it today.",
      "Carrying the limp, Calliste looked to bounce back as he had trials with Cambridge City, West London Saracens, Shrewsbury, Newport, Lincoln and Wycombe, as well as Bulgarian side Levski Sofia. However, reality soon dawned as he decided to walk away from football.",
      "\"The injury I had, which I still have trouble with today, is just insane,\" he told WalesOnline in 2021 as he opened up about the moment that wrecked his football career. \"I had a limp for about three years that never went.",
      "\"It was a terrible, terrible process. When I was trying to regain my career, I couldn’t because I had a limp. Who’s going to sign somebody with a limp? I could score 20 goals in a game, but I had a limp, it doesn’t look like I’m fit, so I do a fitness test and I’m not going to pass it.\"",
      "On being told by Ferguson that he would be leaving the club amid a restructuring of their youth system, Calliste recalled: \"It was a matter of ‘look, it’s just bad timing, there’s too many people in front of you at the moment, he doesn’t want to hold me back and make false promises, I guess’. It was tough emotionally. It was a bit of a shock.",
      "\"It was a bit of a shock. [But] you start to realise you’re a man entering man zone and you need to toughen up and deal with it and move on. Everything happens for a reason.",
      "\"No bitterness,\" he added, when asked for his feelings towards United. \"The decision was the decision. There’s no hard feelings there, it’s all good, they’re a great club, and I’m still a fan of the club.\"",
      "After retiring from football, Calliste more than landed on his feet as he launched watch company Global Watches in 2013, selling high-end timepieces including Rolex, Audemars Piguet and Hublot, from anywhere between £50,000 and £250,000. The luxury business has pulled in up to £15m per year, with footballers and other celebrities among its clientele.",
      "\"Obviously once I realised that football wasn't going to be for me, I had to find something that I used to wake up and enjoy,\" he explained. \"I saw room for myself in the market. Some say it’s over-saturated. There’s a lot of watch dealers out there now, but I don’t really see it as competition personally. If anyone is doing something good, there’s enough out there for everyone.",
      "\"It's a very lucrative market. I think people are enjoying their money nowadays a bit more than they used to, because interest rates in banks - if you've got money sitting in the bank, I don't think you get much back for it nowadays.",
      "\"The values of watches helps,\" he added. \"When I first started getting involved, the same watches back then are now treble value.\"",

      "Paul Scholes may not be thrilled about the prospect of Roberto Mancini taking over from Ruben Amorim at Manchester United. That's his recent outburst about the club is anything to go by.",
      "The future of the Portuguese manager at Old Trafford has been shrouded in uncertainty recently, as he's struggled to turn things around since succeeding Erik ten Hag nearly a year ago. Last season, Amorim could only steer United to a disappointing 15th place finish in the Premier League, and this term, the 40-year-old's record has been inconsistent to say the least, with three victories, three defeats and a draw.",
      "Consequently, several names have been tossed into the ring as potential successors to Amorim should he get the sack, including Gareth Southgate, Oliver Glasner and even Zinedine Zidane. Meanwhile, Mancini - who led Manchester City to their maiden Premier League title in 2011/12 - has also been linked with the job.",
      "Fanatics has slashed the price of football kits and merch from Premier League clubs including Man United, Man City, Liverpool, Everton, Arsenal, Spurs and more.",
      "In conversation with The Times, he shared his concerns about the influx of City executives to join Manchester United. He said: \"You've got Jason Wilcox, Omar Berrada, then there's others. I don't think Manchester United should do that.",
      "\"City have been good for the past ten years, so we hope they bring a bit of that, but it's not what a Manchester United person would want. It's not what we want and it's probably not what the fans want either.",
      "\"You talk about DNA, there's nobody there who knows what a Manchester United person is. Darren Fletcher is the only one who knows anything about what it's like to be a Manchester United player. And look, you don't always have to be the best player, but you just have to have the balls to be able to play for the club, don't you?\"",
      "Former team-mate, Nicky Butt echoed his sentiments, adding: \"It's unbelievable. Every City staff member goes to Man United now.",
      "\"Real Madrid wouldn't do it with Barcelona or vice versa. If you have a DNA that's solid, you should go and handpick the really good coaches - United did that with Kieran McKenna. You see a shining light at Tottenham and bring him in and he teaches you things, but right now there's no one except Darren Fletcher.\"",
      "Despite a much-needed 2-0 victory over newly-promoted Sunderland AFC ahead of the international break, Amorim is still feeling the heat as his team prepares to face bitter rivals Liverpool at Anfield this Sunday. Yet, the gaffer remains confident about his position, insisting that he has the full support of Sir Jim Ratcliffe and the United board.",
      "In a pre-match press conference on Friday, Amorim said: \"He tells me all the time, sometimes with a message after the games but you know, I know and Jim knows that football is not like that.",
      "\"The most important thing is the next game. You cannot control the next day in football so I know that but it is really good to hear that also because of the noise. Omar and Jason tell me that all the time.\"",
      "He added: \"First of all I can feel it, it is not just that thing that people talk [about]. I feel the support every day. Sometimes the pressure I put on myself and the team is often so much bigger than them. I know it is going to take a while but I don't want to think like that, I said that last year.",
      "\"It is really good to hear that, I think it helps our fans understand that the leadership knows it will take a while but, at the same moment, I don't like that because it will give a feeling like we have time to work things out so I don't want that feeling here in our club. It is good to feel the support but we need to show people, at a big club, we are ready to win games.\"",

      "Matthijs de Ligt has given a glimpse into the Manchester United dressing room's feelings towards Ruben Amorim following a slow start to the Premier League season. United currently sit 10th in the table after seven matches, having only secured three victories.",
      "The 2-0 triumph over Sunderland before the international break provided some relief for Amorim after he had been tipped as one of the favourites for the sack by bookies. This weekend sees United heading to Anfield to face Liverpool.",
      "They will be aiming to add to the woes of Arne Slot, whose side has suffered defeats in their last three outings. Last year, Amorim managed to secure a 2-2 draw against the soon-to-be champions on Merseyside, thanks to a late equaliser from Lisandro Martinez.",
      "Fanatics has slashed the price of football kits and merch from Premier League clubs including Man United, Man City, Liverpool, Everton, Arsenal, Spurs and more.",
      "Speculation continues to swirl around Amorim's future at Old Trafford. Bruno Fernandes recently confessed that Sir Jim Ratcliffe's support of Amorim brings a sense of stability to the club.",
      "De Ligt, who joined the club just prior to Amorim taking the reins nearly a year ago, echoed Fernandes' sentiments, revealing his relationship with the United manager. In an interview with The Telegraph, the Dutch defender highlighted the significance of open communication between the players and the gaffer.",
      "\"I have a good relationship with him [Amorim] because of this, because he's quite direct and I am quite direct with him,\" he said. \"It's about honesty, and also in honesty, you can say things that are sometimes not so good, and you accept that also, you know, because it's the only way. Communication and clarity are the most important things in a team.\"",
      "De Ligt also spoke about Amorim's unwavering commitment to his 3-4-2-1 system, which he has publicly stated he won't be changing. \"We're improving as a team,\" the defender said.",
      "\"In modern football, even if you play a back four, almost all teams play by building with three defenders. And we do often defend with four defenders.",
      "\"It's always easy to say 'system this, system that'. But, in the end, it's always adaptable in the game.",
      "There's no situation where the system is always the same in the game. In that way of being flexible and in the structure, we have to find a way to get everything right and make everything happen.\"",

The ex-England midfielder is the president and co-owner of MLS franchise Inter Miami, as well as a co-owner of League Two side Salford City.",
      "Inter Miami appointed ex-Liverpool ace Javier Mascherano as their gaffer in November 2024, with the Argentine already guiding them to secure a spot in the end-of-season play-offs. Former Liverpool hero Luis Suarez is one of Inter Miami's key players, meanwhile - with the Uruguayan frontman netting 17 goals and providing 16 assists in all competitions this season.",
      "However, the Liverpool connection isn't confined to Inter Miami, as there's also a significant former Reds presence at Salford - despite its links to United through Beckham and fellow co-owner Gary Neville. One-time Liverpool youth coach Karl Robinson is the current head coach at Salford, having taken up the role in January 2024, while the Ammies snapped-up former Liverpool prodigy Ben Woodburn at the beginning of last season.",
      "Once the youngest ever goal-scorer for the Reds, before Rio Ngumoha's winner against Newcastle United in August, the versatile Welsh international has chalked up five goals and nine assists from 50 appearances since joining the club. But former Liverpool player Fabio Borini has now also joined Ben Woodburn at Salford City in a surprise move, after the League Two club announced his signing on Friday.",
      "The ex-Italy international has signed a short-term deal with Salford, following a successful training period with the first team over the past month. He had been without a club since leaving Sampdoria last summer.",
      "Having previously played for Chelsea, AS Roma and AC Milan, as well as Liverpool, Borini's move to a League Two side came as a surprise to many observers. However, the forward, who was named as a substitute for Saturday's match against Oldham Athletic, has shed light on his decision to join Salford.",
      "Speaking to the club's in-house media, he said: \"It's been great. I came in to train to keep myself fit in this transition between contracts,\" he told club media. \"And Salford, the gaffer, Alex Bruce were kind enough to allow me to use the facilities and train here.",
      "\"Experience is one thing that I can bring, but it's not just about the experience that I have on the pitch. It's outside of the pitch so leading by example in training, outside training, how to manage a game.",

      "\"It's a challenge I'm embracing and I chose to embrace because I needed the real football, something that warms my heart for football, not for anything else.\"",
      "Borini, who previously formed an attacking partnership with Suarez at Liverpool, arrived at Anfield in a £10.5m transfer from Roma in July 2012. The striker found the net on his Anfield bow in the Europa League, although he failed to establish himself at Anfield.",
      "The 34-year-old managed just three goals and three assists across 38 outings for the Merseyside club overall before departing for Sunderland in a £10m switch in August 2014 - having already spent the 2013/14 campaign on loan at the Stadium of Light after falling down the pecking order following the arrivals of Daniel Sturridge and Iago Aspas.",

      "Liverpool and Manchester United are set to reignite their rivalry on Sunday. While United wing-back Tyrell Malacia most likely won't be involved in the clash, he is one United player that Reds boss Arne Slot previously warned for being \"arrogant.\"",
      "The Dutchman knows the full-back well from their time together at Feyenoord before Slot's switch to Liverpool and the latter's move to Old Trafford in 2022. However, Slot had sent Malacia a grave warning about a particular aspect of his game.",
      "While Slot praised Malacia for operating as a \"driving force\" he also called out his tendency to be too casual on the ball. \"When we're behind he is typically the player to try and force the issue, or to ignite a spark with a run or a tackle,\" Slot told Dutch outlet Bleed Orange.",
      "\"[But] I do see him taunt opponents a bit too much.\" He continued: \"He almost shows too much of the ball, to get them to bite. At times, it's too much. He looks a bit complacent, arrogant even, at times. I talk to him about that.\"",
      "Malacia played under Slot for three seasons before joining the Red Devils in July 2022 for £13million. However, the defender's journey at United has been fraught with challenges, including a string of injuries. He spent the second half of last season on loan at PSV Eindhoven.",
      "While the Dutchman has returned to first-team training this season, he is yet to feature this season after falling out of favour under Ruben Amorim.",
      "Malacia was even part of United's notorious 'bomb squad', the term that was coined for a group of United stars who were exiled by Amorim at the start of pre-season. However, he failed to seek a move away from Old Trafford.",
      "Liverpool will head into Sunday's clash with United off the back of three defeats in a row. However, the Premier League champions will be coming up against a United team, who despite their recent woes, have won three of their last five games in the Premier League.",
      "Slot's team beat United 3-0 away last season but struggled to a draw at Anfield in the return fixture. Yet the Dutchman is confident his team can turn a corner on Sunday at the expense of their arch rivals.",
      "\"I look forward to every single Premier League game but maybe even more towards the United one, because I know how special it is and I've experienced last season how special a game it is,\" Slot said in a pre-match press conference.",
      "\"We know that it's probably the game that's been watched the most all over the world. It's special to be part of it but in the end it's also a game where we have to be at our best, because United, in my opinion, has had a better start of the season than maybe the league table is showing.\"",
      "United produced one of their better performances under Amorim at Anfield last season. The Red Devils dug out a hard-fought 2-2 draw, but squandered a number of chances to win the tie late on.",
      "Speaking of his side's promising showing last season, Amorim told a press conference this week: “Yeah, I remember it, we played well, it was a draw.",
      "\"I was really upset in the end of the game because we proved, on that day, that we can compete against any opponents. I know that it's special for our club. I know that they are fighting all the time for the titles, the number of titles. I know what it means to the fans, but again, it's one game that we need to prove again, that we are playing better\"",

Spanish media reports suggested club hierarchy 'forced' Flick to select Yamal for the Champions League loss to Paris Saint-Germain earlier this month, despite the youngster turning up late to a team meeting.",
      "Rashford was, meanwhile, benched for September's La Liga clash with Getafe for an identical breach of protocol. Claims emerged that Yamal's handling represented 'double standards'.",
      "But Flick has firmly rejected the accusations and maintained that he holds full authority over discipline. \"I'd like to know where you're getting that rumour from,\" he said.",

      "Rashford has made an impressive start with the Catalan heavyweights following his season-long loan switch from Manchester United. The England star, now 27, has netted three goals and registered five assists across his opening 10 appearances, while also winning back his place in the Three Lions squad.",
      "Despite facing criticism from Spanish media after his tardiness last month, sporting director Deco confirmed the club were 'happy' with his adaptation to Barcelona. \"He's on a simple loan, there's no penalty, and if we want him, we have an option to buy,\" the ex-Barca playmaker told Mundo Deportivo.",
      "\"It's too early to talk about decisions for next season, but what matters is that we're happy with him. What we thought he could bring to us, he's bringing.",
      "\"He's a very high-level player - who exploded very early - then he had great seasons at United, then he had years of more complicated management with changes of coaches, and perhaps he struggled too because they demanded a lot of things from him there. But we're happy with him, that's the most important thing.",
      "\"These aren't decisions for now. Now it's time to focus on the games to come. A decision will be made, but that's not being discussed right now. There's a contract between the clubs, but it [the future] has to be discussed.\"",

      "Ruben Amorim has been cautioned that he's setting Manchester United up to fail by repeatedly rotating his defence. The Portuguese manager has faced criticism during the early weeks of this campaign as he attempts to resurrect United's prospects following a dismal 15th-place finish in the Premier League last term.",
      "Club co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe has claimed the former Sporting boss will be afforded three years to demonstrate his worth at Old Trafford, despite United managing only three victories from seven games so far this season. However, former United keeper Ben Foster has challenged Amorim's tactical methods, especially his tendency to regularly withdraw centre-backs during matches.",
      "The ex-England and Wrexham goalkeeper reckons substituting defenders who aren't even injured has harmed the club, emphasising that United haven't been sufficiently in control during games to take such chances.",
      "Speaking during an appearance on talkSPORT, Foster said: \"You need a solid base as a football team to really get consistency. When you're constantly chopping and changing, not only the centre-backs, but the goalkeepers as well, it just sets you up for failure.",
      "\"You can't change your centre-back at 60 minutes. You need them to play the whole 90 minutes. It's fine if you're two or three-nil up at that point, you can bring somebody on. But Man United don't have that luxury. Up until the 90th minute in games, they're fighting or trying to hold on to a lead or or get back into the game.\"",
      "Foster isn't the only ex-United star to question Amorim's tendency for unnecessary defensive switches. Rio Ferdinand also believes the changing of the backline is not helping United's cause.",
      "Speaking on his podcast Rio Presents, Ferdinand expressed his frustration at Amorim's constant substitutions in defence. He posted a clip of the podcast on X with the caption: \"Why do we keep changing our centre backs during the game?! I WOULD HAVE HATED THIS!\"",
      "Amorim took over from Erik ten Hag in November last year and his tenure has proved challenging so far. He's achieved victory in less than a third of their Premier League outings and presided over United's most disappointing campaign on record last term.",

      "Former Liverpool star Michael Owen has revealed he had a secret clause in his Newcastle United contract that could have seen him return to the Reds. Owen, who left Liverpool for Real Madrid in 2004, was keen to return to the Premier League after just one season in Spain.",
      "The striker, who netted 158 goals for Liverpool, eventually signed for Newcastle in 2005 for £16.8million. However, it was his controversial move from Newcastle to Manchester United in 2009 that many believe tarnished his legacy at Anfield.",
      "The ex-England striker has received heavy fire over the years for his decision to join the Red Devils, with Liverpool and United set to reignite their rivalry on Sunday at Anfield. Owen, who has stated that the Liverpool was always in his \"heart\", says he was desperate to resign with the Reds after leaving Spain, and again after leaving Newcastle.",
      "The former England international claims he had a clause in his Newcastle contract allowing him to leave for Liverpool after his first season at St James' Park. However, Liverpool declined the chance to bring him back to Merseyside, reports the Liverpool Echo.",
      "Speaking to Mashable India, Owen said: \"When I left Real Madrid I had one team I was going to sign for and when that wasn’t allowed, when the president of Real Madrid said, 'You can’t go to Liverpool because Newcastle have offered double the money. If Liverpool offer the same then you can go', but Liverpool were never going to do that.",
      "\"I was speaking to the chairman, I was speaking to Rafa Benitez at the time, I was so close to going there until Newcastle doubled the money and almost forced Real Madrid to sell me to them.",
      "\"I had some choices, I either stay at Real Madrid or I go to Newcastle. I decided to go to Newcastle. The only reason I signed [for Newcastle] is so I could insert into the contract that after one year I can go to Liverpool, one team in the world. That’s all I wanted to do.\"",
      "Defending his later switch to United, he added: \"So I had that. But nobody needs to know that. Nobody does know it. Nobody cares to know it. But they do care to say, 'Oh, you played for Liverpool, then you played for Manchester United, you know, you must have no loyalty'\".",
      "Owen continued: \"Like, come on. If you know the story. When I left Newcastle, I was on the phone to Brendan Rodgers, every single year I was on the phone to the Liverpool manager. It’s Liverpool that didn’t want me back.",
      "\"[Luis] Suarez was there, [Fernando] Torres was there. And this is absolutely fine, this is football. I understand that, I don’t hold any grudges to Liverpool for not taking me back when I openly said, 'Please take me, please take me' every single year. That’s life, that’s football.",
      "\"In theory I could hold a grudge against Liverpool and say, 'You said you'd buy me back, we had an agreement you'd take me back and it never happened'\".",
      "Owen endured four injury-plagued campaigns at Newcastle, netting 30 times in 79 matches. He subsequently bagged 17 goals across 52 appearances for United, claiming a Premier League title in 2011 plus a League Cup triumph.",
      "The striker moved to Stoke City in September 2012 before hanging up his boots just one season later.",
      "Fanatics has slashed the price of football kits and merch from Premier League clubs including Man United, Man City, Liverpool, Everton, Arsenal, Spurs and more.",

      "The rare disappointing spell of form has only left Arne Slot's side one point off league leaders Arsenal, with victory over United keeping the pressure on Mikel Arteta's side. However, Ruben Amorim's team head into the showdown on the back of a 2-0 win over Sunderland - which saw them return to winning ways following a testing start.",
      "\"We've been through phases, especially the years that I've been at the club, where we've felt we can have them and obviously we drew in the last two seasons. We played away and got knocked out of the FA Cup, which was pretty tough. They are always difficult, we have to be ready for the big fight.\"",
      "His comments perfectly encapsulate Amorim's current United side, who have shown plenty of inconsistency this season. Van Dijk also admitted that Liverpool have to improve their performances if they are to end their winless run. \"It's pretty clear that we have to improve, offensively, defensively, in possession, set-pieces but the matter of fact that in total, we won seven out of 10 and we still have so much to improve,\" he added.",
      "\"You can put it the other way and put into perspective that if we improve those things, it could be a very special season. We know how the world works, we know there's a lot of noise, analysis on certain things, it's down to us to focus on the target ahead.\"",
      "Slot has also gone on record to concede that United have shown quality throughout the start of the season, despite their league position. Speaking in his press conference on Friday, he said: \"I look forward to every single Premier League game but maybe even more towards the United one, because I know how special it is and I've experienced last season how special a game it is.",
      "\"We know that it's probably the game that's been watched the most all over the world. It's special to be part of it but in the end it's also a game where we have to be at our best, because United, in my opinion, has had a better start of the season than maybe the league table is showing.",
      "\"A very interesting game and a game to look forward to, especially because it's played at Anfield. I think our fans have been so supportive for us as long as I'm here and long before I was here.",
      "\"I think they understand that the team that has lost three times in a row, they need to be ready, our team, but I think our fans can help us and will help us on Sunday as well.\"",

      "Another English club has claimed to have held talks with Turki Al-Sheikh following the Saudi sports kingpin's Manchester United investment comments. Rumours of a takeover at Old Trafford were ignited during the international break when Turki Al-Sheikh, the chairman of Saudi Arabia's General Entertainment Authority, said on social media that a deal with an investor was nearing completion.",
      "\"The best news I heard today is that Manchester United is now in an advanced stage of completing a deal to sell to a new investor. I hope he's better than the previous owners,\" Al-Sheikh posted on X.",
      "He later clarified that he wasn't the potential investor, stating: \"Yesterday's post about Manchester United's potential sale meant one thing: the club is in an advanced negotiation phase with a new investor.",
      "\"Just to clarify, I am not the investor, nor are they from my nation. I'm posting this as a fan who wishes the deal to happen, though it might not necessarily happen.\"",
      "United insiders soon distanced themselves from the claims, which emerged shortly after a wide-ranging interview with part-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe, where he gave no indication of any impending investment or willingness to relinquish control of football operations.",
      "It has now been claimed that Al-Sheikh, who has become an increasingly influential figure in the sports world, especially in boxing, held talks with Bristol City. In September, it was reported Al-Sheikh was close to agreeing a deal to buy the Championship club, only for him to announce on X it was \"not true.\"",
      "However, the Robins have revealed talks with Al-Sheikh did take place. CEO Tom Rawcliffe told a fans' forum this week: \"Yes, we had conversations with him and we are up for investment but it has to be the right investment.\"",
      "Fanatics has slashed the price of football kits and merch from Premier League clubs including Man United, Man City, Liverpool, Everton, Arsenal, Spurs and more.",

      "\"It's no secret that we're looking for investment whether that is a minority or majority,\" added Rawcliffe. \"It's going to happen at some stage but the Lansdown family are not going to be here forever and we've got to prepare ourselves. We don't know what's going to happen in the future.",
      "\"At the moment, there's nothing imminent, but we are well backed. We've had interest from all over the world.",
      "\"Predominantly with football clubs and who is buying right now it tends to be US or Middle East-based backers and so we've had interest from both of those, but we haven't come overly close.\"",

      "David Beckham revealed that wife Victoria was given special instructions for his 50th birthday. The footballing legend turned 50 on May 2 earlier this year and celebrated in style with family and friends, with Tom Cruise, Guy Ritchie and Gordon Ramsey just some of the star-studded names to attend his dinner party in London.",
      "However, away from the glitz and glamour of parties and holidays, the simple act of gift-giving remains a common practice within the family, with Beckham detailing a particular moment where he had to make a request for a very important reason.",
      "The England legend appeared on the latest episode of Salford City FC's docu-series on YouTube, which gives fans a peek behind the curtain at the club. He chatted with former team-mate Gary Neville about various topics, with the duo touching on money.",
      "On the topic of looking to the future, Neville told a story about when he moved his pension to a company that could allow him to buy commercial property, before losing it all. The former right-back then asked Beckham whether he had ever experienced anything similar.",
      "\"My wife is quite...,\" began Beckham, before Neville suggested: \"Prudent?\"",
      "\"Very,\" continued Beckham. \"I will go and buy her a handbag and I know she's going to like it, so it doesn't matter what I spend on it. Then, she won't. For my 50th birthday, I had to say, don't buy me anything s***!",
      "\"I did! I said, I've never asked for anything significant. I want significant for this one birthday! To be fair to her, she did well!\"",
      "Beckham's confession that he never asks for anything major, despite his astronomical net worth with wife Victoria, shows how he has retained his humble nature, despite the notoriety and fame.",
      "David and Victoria famously starred in a 2023 Netflix documentary which, although primarily focusing on the former United man, also showcased aspects of their life together. One of the most popular and funny clips of the series showed the ex-Real Madrid midfielder gate-crashing his wife's interview to ensure she was telling the truth, evidencing the brilliant camaraderie they have together.",
      "In the video, Victoria had just said that the couple were very working class, to which Beckham interjected, telling her to be honest and tell the film crew what car her dad picked her up from at school. She confirmed it was a Rolls Royce before Beckham simply said: \"Thank you\" before exiting the room in a comical moment.",
      "With Salford, Neville and Beckham are overseeing a key change at the club. More than a decade ago, when the Class of '92 took over, the team colours were changed to red - something which was not looked on kindly.",
      "However, it has now been revealed that Salford will return to wearing orange, marking the end of a 12-year period in red. Neville and Beckham completed the buy-out of their former team-mates in May, with a new ownership structure that includes businessman Declan Kelly and former banker Lord Mervyn Davies.",
      "Following extensive consultation with fans, the colour switch has been backed by an overwhelming majority of 77.1%. The club are also working to update seats, cladding and further infrastructure upgrades.",

      "Manchester United superstar Bruno Fernandes has thrown his support behind under-fire manager Ruben Amorim, despite the swirling rumours about his future at Old Trafford. Amorim has been thrust into the limelight once more this season following a lacklustre start to the 2025/2026 campaign.",
      "After a 3-1 defeat to Brentford three weeks ago, the Portuguese boss was tipped to be the next Premier League manager to get the boot. However, a 2-0 win over Sunderland before the international break took some of the heat off - and a public endorsement from co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe has since dispelled any immediate concerns about his job security.",
      "Ratcliffe suggested he would give Amorim three years to prove his worth at Old Trafford, despite only amassing 37 points from his last 34 top-tier matches. \"Ruben needs to demonstrate he is a great coach over three years,\" he declared on The Business podcast. \"That's where I would be. The press, sometimes I don't understand. They want overnight success.",
      "\"They think it's a light switch. You know, you flick a switch and it's all going to be roses tomorrow. You can't run a club like Manchester United on kneejerk reactions to some journalist who goes off on one every week.\"",
      "Ahead of Sunday's clash with bitter rivals Liverpool, Amorim expressed gratitude for Ratcliffe's vote of confidence. Fernandes, who himself has faced criticism for his performances this season, is the first player to publicly comment on the English billionaire's defence of Amorim.",
      "\"We all know, and I think the manager has spoken about it, results make a manager stay or not. The manager is very aware of that. The players are very aware that we need to improve and to win games to help the manager be more stable and be more confident in what we can do in the moment, in the future.",
      "\"I think the club needs some stability, that's the main thing from Sir Jim that he wants to pass through everyone. We've always spoken about giving them time. I think sometimes you need to look at the bigger picture, and from the club side, they need to do that.",
      "\"As a player and as a group of players, we believe the manager can help this club get back to where it belongs.\" He continued: \"I don't know what the aim of Sir Jim is to say that.",
      "\"I think [maybe] to pass some confidence on to the squad, to the staff, to make it look like we are on a good path, not the one we want, but on a good path. We want to improve that. If Sir Jim sees that - the same as the players - that the manager is the right one for the job, it makes it better. We have got two groups looking in the same way.\"",

      "Following confirmation of his appointment, Amorim managed three further Sporting games, a 5-1 drubbing of Estela in the Primeira Liga, a memorable 4-1 win over Manchester City in the Champions League and a stunning fightback victory at Braga. Sporting trailed 2-1 with less than 10 minutes to go before triumphing 4-2.",
      "It was a fitting way for Amorim to sign off from his success-filled reign, which included two Primeira Liga titles. Now, his emotional final address to his players has been aired as part of a club documentary that chronicles the 2024/25 season.",
      "He told his squad: “I don't like goodbyes. We’ll win the championship. There’s no turning back. The difference is huge, huge.",
      "“What you did in the second half, wow! But now, is it going to be difficult? It’s going to be difficult for everyone. You have to help Quaresma, you have to help Pote, Geny, Ivan, who never plays, Esgaio. It's going to be difficult.",
      "“We’re going to win this s***... You guys are unbelievable, much better than on Tuesday [against City], much better. What I felt here in the second half... The third goal, the fourth goal, guys, it was the best football moment.”",
      "By that point Amorim was welling up while his speech was interrupted by a round of applause from the group. He went on: “Everything you need from me, everything, you'll have.",
      "“I’ll be cheering for you more than for myself. Thank you for everything, you’re the greatest, by far. Thank you for everything. No more goodbyes, okay, my boys?”",

After finishing in lower mid-table and losing in the final of the Europa League last season, hopes were high after a summer of heavy spending in the transfer market.",
      "However, the Red Devils have endured a tough start, raising doubts about Amorim’s future. He has received a vote of confidence from minority owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe, while the 2-0 win over Sunderland before the international left them just six points behind leaders Arsenal.",

      "Senne Lammens wore a polo shirt and a navy sweatshirt when he visited Old Trafford after signing for Manchester United. The young goalkeeper looked as though he could be joining United to work in their HR department.",
      "The same observation was made when Lammens reported for international duty with Belgium last week - the 23-year-old was dressed in a beige collared jacket, a khaki t-shirt and chinos.",
      "\"By accident, I saw an article saying he was wearing something boring when he reported for international duty and fans saying they hoped he stays like this,\" laughed Hayk Milkon, one of Lammens' former coaches.",
      "\"This 'boringness' is just the way Senne is, he's really calm and no excesses. He focuses on what he needs to focus on and is open with the people around him. He keeps his feet on the ground.\"",
      "If Lammens looks like someone who could work in an office, every workplace would love to have him in their five-a-side team. United believe they have signed a young goalkeeper with huge potential, and fans who were present at Old Trafford against Sunderland left the stadium buzzing about his debut.",
      "The quirk is that Lammens appears to be a different person when he wears his goalkeeper kit. He made a supremely confident United debut, aggressively commanded his area and kept a clean sheet.",
      "Milkon coached Lammens during their time together at Club Brugge. Milkon is now the youngest manager in the Belgian top-flight and Lammens plays for the biggest club in England.",
      "\"It was Senne with his headphones on. He would go into the gym to do his recovery or some extra top-ups. Or he would just go to relax by playing basketball - he loved to play basketball.\"",
      "Milkon coached in different roles at Club Brugge. He was the assistant of Club NXT (their reserve team), served as their interim manager, was in charge of the Under-18s and eventually became a first-team coach.",
      "His time at Club Brugge coincided with Lammens progressing from the academy to their first team, so he is uniquely positioned to provide insight into United's new goalkeeper signing.",
      "Lammens joined Club Brugge's academy when he was 12. \"He was a guy with huge potential,\" said Milkon. \"As I learned from colleagues who had worked with him when he was much younger, I heard there was a moment that clicked in his head when he became super professional.",
      "\"He was one of the guys during Covid - when the players were not able to train - who was doing a lot at home, he was really going far with this to be the best in these types of areas.",
      "\"Then he continued like this when he joined the first team to train with them. He always wanted to improve. We also had something in place to look at the parameters on which goalkeepers are judged.",
      "\"You see the potential of the goalkeeper based on what they do in games; so their positioning, their decision-making and so on, and Senne was always quite high in these areas.",
      "\"The only bad luck that he had was that the first-team goalkeeper was Simon Mignolet. He's an amazing goalkeeper, so it was difficult for Senne to stay over there in the role of No.2.",
      "\"That would have also blocked his growth, so it was good for him in the end to make the step to go to Antwerp and he did a tremendous job there. It was amazing to see how fast he adapted.\"",
      "Milkon continued: \"I think for us at Club Brugge, it was very clear to everyone that Senne was a top goalkeeper. He would have been the perfect fit for Club Brugge to be the No.1.",
      "\"That was not possible because Mignolet was there. But the parameters that we used to judge his performances indicated he was ticking so many boxes already, and he was consistently doing it.",
      "\"There weren't ups and downs with his performances. He was consistently really high and when you compare this to the top goalkeepers, you have a benchmark to say 'Ok, what potential does this guy have?'",
      "\"He had some chances with the first team at Club Brugge and made a mistake, or maybe two, but in the end it was very clear to everyone that he was a top goalkeeper.",
      "\"It was impossible to try to extend his contract because, again, you have Mignolet, and you cannot block a guy like this. You know he has to go out, he has to play, and he will improve even more.\"",
      "When asked about Lammens' strengths, he said: \"I would say that his decision-making was very good. He is very calm, he sees the solutions on the pitch, he has a quick reaction time and understands the balance between risk and reward, and which decisions are the right ones to make.",
      "\"His clean passing is great, his footwork was really good, and he's just an amazing goalkeeper with the shot-stopping. He made some incredible saves back then already. He's quite a complete goalkeeper.",
      "\"But making the right decisions at a very young age, being very mature with this, was really impressive. And the fact that he is good with both feet is another big strength.",
      "\"For me, Senne is a very calm guy and has all the qualities to be a top professional. That was my impression when I first met him when he was younger and he never changed.\"",
      "Lammens joined Royal Antwerp on a free transfer in the summer of 2023. He was handed his debut a few months later and served as an understudy that season, but earned first-choice status for 2024/2025.",
      "His performances drew attention from the Belgian media. Lammens saved four penalties across a successful first full campaign and received a call-up to Belgium's senior squad in March.",
      "Milkon said: \"I was not surprised when I saw Manchester United had come calling. And to record his first clean sheet, I was really happy for him. Senne is a potential No.1 for the Red Devils - the Belgium national team.",
      "\"He got his chance, he took it, and we're all really proud of him, but we knew it would happen. I believe he has all the capabilities to become the best in the world, so I wish him all the best. I'm sure he will have a very good career in England, and Manchester United should return to the big club they used to be.",
      "\"He will have a positive impact on that, for sure, and hopefully he will be Belgium's first-choice goalkeeper soon. I believe he has the potential, the skillset and the personality to do that.",
      "\"For me, it was just having a tiny little part in having an influence on him at Brugge, but it was the most positive memories of our relationship that we had during this spell.",
      "\"I'm very proud that he is reaching these high levels and not surprised. I believe he will be successful because he is a guy who will not change his focus or start to do something different. He is calm, that's his personality and character, and he wants to succeed. He is hungry and will keep working to be his best.",
      "\"He is so calm, and you have to be patient in football. You cannot worry too much and want things too early, but finding the balance between not being impatient and, at the same time, pushing and demanding what you deserve in a good way, means everything will sort itself out.\"",
      "United staff who have worked with Lammens at Carrington have echoed Milkon's sentiments. He has been described as \"really mature for his age\" and is said to have taken the move in his stride.",
      "Lammens is understood to have impressed coaches during training sessions and a United source said that lots of people have been speaking positively about him. He has already relocated from the luxury hotel where he was initially staying and into a house.",
      "It's no surprise that Lammens likes to play basketball at 6ft 3in, but he is a keen golfer, which is common ground with the likes of Tom Heaton, Luke Shaw, Mason Mount and Harry Maguire.",
      "Matthijs de Ligt, Amad, Maguire and Shaw jogged straight to Lammens to congratulate him after full-time against Sunderland. \"Are you Schmeichel in disguise?\" was chanted at Lammens from the Stretford End.",
      "It remains to be seen whether Lammens will start against Liverpool on Sunday, but it would be a surprise to see him on the bench after delivering a strong debut before the international break.",
      "There would be nothing boring about keeping another clean sheet - this time at Anfield.",
      "Fanatics has slashed the price of Man United kits and merch with more than £60 off select items.",

      "When former Blackburn Rovers academy coach Mike Sheron first became aware of Adam Wharton, the midfielder was just 12 years old and while it was far too early to make a judgement on what type of player he would become, there were already hints of the talent he possessed.",
      "\"I have been in and around Adam on a daily basis throughout his time at Blackburn,\" Sheron told MEN Sport this week. \"He has always been a fairly quiet young lad but he had an inner confidence about himself.",
      "\"He had a velvet touch, straightaway you were drawn to his ability to control a football and he used his body particularly well. His weight of pass was exceptional and as he got older you became more critical on how to build your team and you just had to go through him.",
      "\"He would never give the ball away, nine times out of ten he was picking the right pass out and it has been a joy watching him develop, it has been brilliant this last 18 months to see what he has been doing.\"",
      "When Palace paid £18million for Wharton in the 2024 mid-season transfer window, he was relatively unknown to most in the Premier League bubble, but at Ewood Park he had already become a firm fan favourite.",
      "Wharton grew up in a Blackburn-mad household with an incredibly supportive family and network surrounding him.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "Reminiscing over one particular trip to Middlesbrough, it was easy to see why Sheron holds Wharton in such high esteem. \"From our point of view, as coaches, if you had a flaw in your set-up, in your session design, he would find it and he would exploit it,\" the 53-year-old who departed Blackburn in September explained.",
      "\"He would always find a solution to increase his chances of winning for his team and he made you a better coach as well, not just influencing the players around him, he made you a better coach and it was really enthralling to work around him. It is definitely rare [for a player to better you when you're a coach] and it is not something that you come across too often.",
      "\"I felt, as a coach, you never had to give him too many details, he would just figure it out for himself. Like everything else, there is more than one way to do things, so you don’t tell him what to do, you give him a broad landscape of: ‘This is the way that we are wanting to try and do things today, but overall it is down to yourselves how you go about it’.",
      "\"One story I do have of him is that we went to a day event at Middlesbrough, an Under-14s player-led tournament. Basically, all of the players would pick the teams, come up with the tactics and we just had to watch from afar.",
      "\"We actually went with an Under-13s set-up because we knew our group at the time at Under-13s was very good. It was Adam’s group, which also had Harry Leonard who is now at Peterborough and Kristi Montgomery who is in and around the first-team now, and they did exceptionally well, but I think Adam, again, was pivotal and was a major factor in us winning that tournament that day.",
      "\"He had that quiet leadership, he doesn’t shout, he doesn’t dictate but he has that inner belief about what he is doing and how to be successful. A lot of the time, he was right.",
      "\"He didn’t agree with everything that you would tell him, you would sometimes criticise his work ethic but he didn’t expend a lot of energy if he didn’t have to, and he was quite good at that. You see him doing elements of that now.",
      "\"You don’t see him running around everywhere, he just gets himself into good positions, he reads the game and that technical ability has ensured he has done fantastically well.\"",
      "A common theme of the conversation about Wharton was the midfielder's 'inner confidence and belief'.",
      "Wharton never needs to be the loudest voice in the room but he knows he can influence players and the game with his own ability. Sheron spoke with pride when remembering how Declan Rice and Harry Kane spoke so glowingly of him after his first England appearance.",
      "When quizzed about Wharton's best position in the midfield pivot, Sheron, who also worked in the youth set-up at Liverpool, insisted that the England international has the ability to suit whichever role the manager needs at any given time - even comparing him to a United favourite. \"Personally, I always felt he was best suited in and around the No.6 role,\" he continued.",
      "\"I like how they have done it at Palace as a lot of the time he is in with a Will Hughes or he is in with another player and there are two sitters. But in a team that is dominating possession, I don’t think there is much of a problem if he is the single pivot.",
      "\"His composure on the ball is second to none, he hardly ever gives the ball away, he can use both feet, read situations, he is so intelligent with his positioning to intercept but it has been a shock to see how well he is doing because you just never know.",
      "\"His game has really gone to the next level around more dynamic players and I would have him down as someone like a Michael Carrick who is really football-intelligent and composed, it really has been a joy to watch him develop.\"",
      "Such a talented player is exactly what United need to mix up their midfield next summer. The midfield department went untouched this previous window as focus gravitated towards the attack.",
      "The concern for the Reds is whether they would be able to attract Wharton without necessarily having the Champions League football which Crystal Palace chairman Steve Parish suggested he would crave in the future. Fortunately for the Reds, Sheron believes that an immediate move to a Champions League club is not necessarily the be-all and end-all at this stage.",
      "\"We are all aware of United’s standing in the game and the frustrations they have had in the last couple of years, but who would have thought that going to Crystal Palace would have been a fantastic move?\" Sheron said.",
      "\"If a team sells the club to him and his family and advisors, and he feels that it is the right move for him, then I don’t think it is a case of him needing to go to Manchester City or Liverpool or Arsenal, I think it is a case of whether he gets the vibes that he is going to be valued, be a big part of the team going forward and we all know the animal that Manchester United can become. So I wouldn’t say it is a yes or a no on United, but rather whether the move is the right fit for him.",
      "\"I would put my faith in Adam, who has made a few good decisions, to make the right decision and if he thinks Manchester United is the right fit then it will be. Adam will make other players play better and other players will get their confidence up playing with him.\"",

      "Manchester United might have dropped a hint on who will start against Liverpool this weekend.",
      "Bruno Fernandes, Casemiro, Matheus Cunha and Amad were among the players to miss full training, albeit club sources confirmed some of the absentees completed recovery work.",
      "Casemiro was absent from training because he played 90 minutes in away friendlies for Brazil against South Korea and Japan during the break. Brazil manager Carlo Ancelotti will not be on Amorim's Christmas card list.",
      "Casemiro would have been a nailed-on starter against Liverpool, but his workload during the break raises questions over how ready he will be to start.",
      "It seems unlikely that Amorim will start the 33-year-old against Liverpool, given he has trekked halfway around the world to Asia and played the entirety of both friendly matches.",
      "That means Manuel Ugarte will be under consideration to start at Anfield. Ugarte was not included in the Uruguay squad for the international break and will be fresh compared to Casemiro.",
      "Ugarte was also a surprise starter against Manchester City when domestic football resumed following the September international break. He had last been seen on a pitch in the defeat to Grimsby Town.",
      "Casemiro was named on the bench against City and Ugarte performed well in the first half, although he didn't cover himself in glory when he made his next start against Brentford.",
      "Ugarte was expected to be a big winner from Amorim's appointment because he had thrived when they worked together at Sporting Lisbon, however, he has been unable to earn a consistent starting role.",
      "It did not reflect well on Ugarte that United looked at midfielders of his ilk in the summer transfer window.",
      "Ugarte was signed for €50million (£42.3m), with a further €10m (£8.5m) in add-ons, in the summer of 2024, and United have already conceded they need a new signing in the same mould.",
      "Fernandes and Ugarte are the most likely midfield partnership at Anfield. Ugarte does not inspire confidence, but his performance at Anfield in January should provide some encouragement ahead of Sunday's clash.",
      "Ugarte started alongside Kobbie Mainoo in the 2-2 draw against Liverpool at the beginning of the year. The pair worked brilliantly together and Ugarte looked like the player United thought they were signing.",
      "Perhaps another start at Anfield will spark another improved performance from Ugarte.",

      "Hello and welcome to live coverage of all the latest Manchester United news on Saturday, October 18.",
      "Premier League football is back, and United return with a big one. Ruben Amorim's men travel to Anfield tomorrow to take on historic rivals Liverpool, who have lost their last three games.",
      "The focus has been on this weekend's game, but there has been plenty of discussion about topics off the pitch. Takeover speculation and transfer rumours have continued to develop over the past weeks, with Sheikh Jassim back in the headlines.",
      "Old Trafford icon Eric Cantona has also been namechecked in a massive takeover. On the transfer front, Carlos Baleba remains linked with a move to Manchester ahead of the January transfer window.",
      "There have also been fresh links to Sporting CP midfielder Morten Hjulmand and Real Madrid attacker Endrick.",
      "We will have all the latest on that, top transfer headlines and injury news as the Reds' return to action with a clash against Liverpool this weekend edges closer...",
      "Real Madrid manager Xabi Alonso appeared to pour cold water over the possibility of Manchester United loaning Endrick. The Brazilian teenager has found opportunities at the Bernabeu hard to come by ever since Kylian Mbappe joined the club.",
      "Alonso is yet to deploy the 19-year-old in the starting eleven or from the bench this season. However, the ex-Liverpool midfielder said Endrick is still in his thoughts, when asked about the potentiality of the Brazilian being loaned to Old Trafford.",
      "He said: “That’s not on my mind right now, it’s not a consideration. They’re both ready to play. It’s a position where we have fantastic competition.”",
      "Ruben Amorim's potential starting hinted Noussair Mazraoui may miss the clash against Liverpool, Lisandro Martinez is also still not ready to step back onto the pitch, but is getting closer.",
      "With all of the injury updates, here is how United may line-up against Arne Slot's Liverpool.",
      "3-4-3 - Lammens, Dalot, De Ligt, Yoro, Shaw, Dorgu, Fernandes (C), Casemiro, Mbeumo, Sesko, Mount",
      "Possible Liverpool starting eleven",
      "4-2-3-1 - Mamardashvili, Szoboszlai, Van Dijk (C), Konate, Robertson, Ryan Gravenberch, Jones, Salah, Wirtz, Gakpo, Ekitike",
      "Sir Alex Ferguson's former nemesis Roberto Mancini has been named as a shock contender for the Nottingham Forest job. Mancini, who came to blows on many occasions with the Manchester United legend during his reign at City, is a contender to replace Ange Postecoglou, according to talkSPORT.",
      "The Italian, who won City's first ever Premier League title, has not managed a club team since 2018, when he left Russian side Zenit St Petersburg. He spent five years as Italy manager, winning Euro 2020, before departing to take charge of the Saudi Arabia international side in 2023.",
      "But now he could be returning to club football and the Premier League, 12 years after he was replaced by Manuel Pellegrini. Sean Dyche was also identified as a target, while the likes of Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and Erik ten Hag have also been linked.",
      "Manchester United have been linked with a move for Danish star Victor Froholdt, according to Fichajes. The Porto midfielder has a release clause of €85million (£74m) and has been impressive for the Portuguese side.",
      "United loaned his Danish counterpart Rasmus Hojlund to Napoli this summer. While the ex-Atalanta striker has started strongly for Antonio Conte's side, Froholdt has been impressive for Porto.",
      "Defensive midfield has been one of United's major weakpoints this season, with neither Casemiro or Manuel Ugarte convincing, while Bruno Fernandes has also looked uncomfortable in the deeper position.",
      "Manchester United could be without Noussair Mazraoui for their game against Liverpool this weekend.",
      "United will travel to Merseyside on Sunday to face the Premier League champions at Anfield. Amorim secured a much-needed 2-0 victory against Sunderland before the international break and is looking to win back-to-back league games for the first time since his appointment.",
      "Mazraoui has not played since September 20 due to an unspecified injury and Amorim admitted he doesn't know whether he will be involved this weekend.",
      "Tottenham Hotspur are reportedly considering a move for Manchester United midfielder Kobbie Mainoo. The United academy graduate became a massive part of Erik ten Hag's side, scoring the vital second goal in United's FA Cup final triumph over Manchester City.",
      "However, he does not appear to fit in Ruben Amorim's inflexible 3-4-3 system, with the Portuguese manager instead preferring to deploy Bruno Fernandes further back, next to defensive midfielders like Casemiro or Manuel Ugarte. Amorim has also said Mainoo is directly competing for a place with the United skipper.",
      "According to the Daily Briefing, Tottenham could take advantage of the situation by making an approach for Mainoo in January. He is yet to make an England appearance under Thomas Tuchel and has also not started a match in the Premier League this season.",
      "Crystal Palace are relaxed about the future of Adam Wharton amid reported transfer interest from United.",
      "Although there have been no talks about a new contract for the England international, Palace are planning for the future with him as a focus point of their team. He has four years left on his current deal at Selhurst Park.",
      "According to the i paper, Amorim is said to be a big admirer of Wharton and United could now opt to prioritise him ahead of signing Carlos Baleba, who was reported to be a summer target for the Reds.",
      "On loan Manchester United prospect Ethan Wheatley scored a fine goal in Northampton Town's clash with Doncaster Rovers. The 19-year-old joined the League One side on loan until next summer.",
      "Against Rovers, he contributed his second goal for the club, heading in a dangerous freekick from Dean Campbell. He also went on to win the crucial penalty, which was converted by Northampton star Sam Hoskins to put the club 2-1 ahead.",
      "A promising display from the United youngster, who growing with every passing game.",
      "Manchester United legend and former manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has also emerged as an 8/1 contender for the Nottingham Forest vacancy.",
      "Betfair have placed the Norwegian in the running, having been sacked by Besiktas at the end of August. Solskjaer has not returned to the Premier League since he was dismissed by United in November 2021.",
      "Forest looks like an appealing position, with their place in the Europa League and their high investment. However, would Solskjaer believe he can thrive under the overbearing gaze of Forest owner Evangelos Marinakis?",
      "There are healthy odds on the prospect of Erik ten Hag becoming the next manager of Nottingham Forest. The Midlanders made the decision to sack Ange Postecoglou after only 39 days in charge.",
      "Similarly to the Australian, Ten Hag was sacked after less than ten weeks at Bayer Leverkusen. However, he is in the conversation to be the next boss at the City Ground, with Betfair giving him 10/1 odds.",
      "With Forest also competing in the Europa League and boasting talented stars such as Elliott Anderson, Morgan Gibbs-White and many others, Ten Hag may relish the opportunity.",
      "Ange Postecoglou has been sacked by Nottingham Forest.",
      "The former Spurs boss has been relieved of his duties after a 3-0 defeat to Chelsea.",
      "\"Nottingham Forest Football Club can confirm that after a series of disappointing results and performances, Ange Postecoglou has been relieved of his duties as head coach with immediate effect,\" the statement read.",
      "\"The Club will make no further comment at this time.\"",
      "Matthijs de Ligt has defended Ruben Amorim.",
      "He told the Telegraph: \"I have a good relationship with him [Amorim] because of this, because he's quite direct and I am quite direct with him,\" he said.",
      "\"It's about honesty and also in honesty you can say things that are sometimes not so good and you accept that also, you know, because it's the only way. Communication and clarity is the most important thing in a team.\"",
      "Ruben Amorim says Man United are looking to follow Liverpool's footsteps to challenge at the summit again.",
      "\"Sometimes things change really fast but, if you see the history of both clubs, you can feel that sometimes you have one club that is winning, winning, winning and the other club is having a bad moment,\" he said.",
      "\"That happened with Liverpool when Manchester United was winning everything. And that happened with Manchester United when Liverpool was winning everything.",
      "\"So we just have to acknowledge that, to be really honest with the fans, but we can win any game. So, if we think about just winning the next game, that is the most important thing, we can win the next game.",
      "\"If we are going to fight to be at the same level of Liverpool in the future, that is the idea. I don't know how long it is going to take.\"",
      "Manchester United are exploring ways to adjust the Old Trafford pitch after the issue was raised during a recent fans' forum.",
      "The Old Trafford pitch last underwent major improvements in the 1990s, and was elevated and bordered by a ditch. However, this has contributed to injuries over the years.",
      "According to The Sun, the club will look at changing the 'perimeter' of the pitch, to reduce the risk of injuries. During a United fans' forum held last week, a supporter highlighted that many injuries across the Premier League have been caused by players striking advertising hoardings at speed.",

      "He added: “I think the pressure for this game, I think purely because I don’t think United fans will be expecting three points in this game, where in other games they are,” he said. “I think they’ll go in a say, if we can get a point we’ll be happy with that, where I think for Liverpool, if Liverpool lose four games in a row and they lose to Man United at Anfield, I think the pressure is definitely on Liverpool for this game.”",
      "Ruben Amorim has revealed that he still has the backing of Sir Jim Ratcliffe at Manchester United.",
      "\"He tells me all the time, sometimes with a message after the games but you know, I know and Jim knows that football is not like that. The most important thing is the next game.",
      "\"You cannot control the next day in football so I know that but it is really good to hear that also because of the noise. Omar [Berrada] and Jason [Wilcox] tell me that all the time.\"",
      "He added: \"First of all I can feel it, it is not just that thing that people talk [about]. I feel the support every day.",
      "\"Sometimes the pressure I put on myself and the team is often so much bigger than them. I know it is going to take a while but I don't want to think like that, I said that last year.\"",

      "The Austrian has been mooted as Ruben Amorim's replacement at Old Trafford after the United head coach has endured a difficult start to the campaign.",

      "The midfielder established himself as the designated penalty-taker during Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's tenure and only briefly lost that responsibility during Cristiano Ronaldo's second stint at the club.",
      "Before this season, Fernandes had last missed a penalty against Chelsea in December 2023. The midfielder's penalty record has been exemplary, but he sent a penalty over the crossbar against Fulham at Craven Cottage and his penalty was saved against Brentford at the Gtech Community Stadium.",
      "Fernandes converted from the spot in added time against Burnley to secure a late victory, but his two penalty misses have led to suggestions that a new penalty taker could be appointed.",

      "\"But he's really confident. He's training the penalties. He's trying to understand that people are watching the way he scores the penalties. So he will be ready. We have more guys also to score a penalty if he needs.\"",

      "The 20-year-old has not started in the Premier League this season and has been limited to five substitute appearances. Mainoo is desperate to represent England at the 2026 World Cup after featuring at Euro 2024, but he needs to be playing regularly to be included in Thomas Tuchel's plans.",
      "Zirkzee finds himself in a similar situation. The Dutchman is keen to represent the Netherlands at next summer's World Cup, but he's been given just 82 minutes across all competitions.",
      "Mainoo continues to be linked with a move away in the January transfer window and Zirkzee could look to leave if his situation does not improve, but Amorim suggested they are important squad players.",
      "Amorim was asked whether he understood why Mainoo and Zirkzee would be frustrated, especially in a World Cup season, and he responded: \"That is normal. I also know that in our club everything is a lot of noise. You have to have news. Players are not playing. They want to play.",
      "\"Like you said, there's a World Cup. There are agents that listen to the players talking all the time. So I understand that, but they are our players and we need everyone to have a good season.\"",

      "Bruno Fernandes has fired a four-word message to Chelsea star Pedro Neto in the aftermath of his frosty moment with former Manchester United star Alejandro Garnacho. Garnacho was hooked at half-time as Chelsea eased past Nottingham Forest in the Premier League on Saturday lunchtime.",
      "That game saw Ange Postecoglou brutally sacked by Forest just 17 minutes after the final whistle. However, while that was the big talking point across the Premier League, this weekend, all eyes at Old Trafford were on Garnacho.",
      "The 21-year-old Argentine was celebrating at full-time with his Chelsea teammates, but it was far from plain sailing for him at the City Ground. Indeed, the ex-United player - who left Old Trafford this summer - lasted just 45 minutes before Enzo Maresca stepped in and substituted Garnacho as part of a triple change.",
      "Ultimately, that inspired Chelsea to victory, but it was a tough moment for Garnacho to endure. That came after a tense moment with Neto, who fumed at his fellow forward in the first half in a flashpoint that was picked up by TV cameras at the match.",
      "With the dust seemingly now settled, Fernandes has reached out to Neto - his Portugal teammate. In a four-word comment on social media, the United captain said: \"Chuta que chutas bem.\"",
      "Translated from Portuguese, he wrote: \"Kick you kick good.\" The reply to Neto's post featured a heart eyes emoji.",
      "Neto played a key part in a 3-0 victory for Chelsea on Saturday lunchtime, scoring a free-kick while also laying up Josh Acheampong for the opener. Reece James rubber-stamped the result in the dying embers as Chelsea earned three points, while Postecoglou was sacked shortly after the final whistle at the City Ground.",
      "\"I know Neto was really frustrated with him. He was crossing the ball and not getting on the other side. Neto was really frustrated with him.\"",
      "Garnacho has already been active on social media himself post-match. Also taking to Instagram, he wrote: \"Happy for these three important points!\" accompanied by blue and white heart emojis on his stories.",

      "Regarding the team news, Noussair Mazraoui is a doubt, while Lisandro Martinez remains sidelined.",
      "Here's how our writers think United should line up at Anfield:",
      "Steven Railston",
      "Casemiro played the full 90 minutes against South Korea and Japan during the international break, so Brazil manager Carlo Ancelotti will not be on Amorim's Christmas card list.",
      "Manuel Ugarte was not included in the Uruguay squad and he is fresh in comparison. Amorim hinted that Casemiro could be rested during his press conference, but he should start if he is physically ready to play. Ugarte has been disappointing, albeit he did emerge with credit from the first half against Manchester City.",
      "I prefer Harry Maguire on the left side of the back-three, while I would also bring Patrick Dorgu into the side at the expense of Amad. Liverpool have superb attacking quality and starting 'defenders' at wing-back is logical.",
      "The attacking line picks itself. Mason Mount was excellent against Sunderland before the international break, and his work rate will be important at Anfield, so he should retain his role.",
      "Jack Flintham",
      "I would welcome the addition of Maguire to the starting line-up at Anfield ahead of Luke Shaw. Maguire is a reliable defender and United need stability.",

      "Fanatics has slashed the price of Man United kits and merch with more than £60 off select items.",
      "That would mean that Bryan Mbeumo is dropped from the starting XI and while that is very harsh, his impact off the bench could work wonders on Sunday. Mount just has to start after his performance against Sunderland.",

      "Paul Scholes would not be a fan of Roberto Mancini replacing Ruben Amorim at Manchester United, if his recent rant about the club is anything to go by.",
      "The Portuguese tactician's future at Old Trafford has been cast into speculation as of recent, given he has failed to turn the tide since taking over from Erik ten Hag almost a year ago. Amorim could only guide United to a dismal 15th-place finish in the Premier League standings last term, while 2025/26 has seen the 40-year-old achieve a mixed-bag of results with three wins, three losses and a draw to show for his efforts.",
      "As a result, a number of names have been thrown into the hat as to who could potentially replace Amorim should he be given the boot, with the likes of Gareth Southgate, Oliver Glasner and even Zinedine Zidane being brought up in conversation. Meanwhile, Mancini - who won Manchester City's first ever Premier League title in 2011/12 - has also been linked with the post.",
      "As per a report from the Sun, the 60-year-old - who has been out of work since he left the Saudi Arabian national team last year - has told associates that he could make a change at Manchester United given the chance. However, Reds legend Scholes may be opposed to the idea of another former member of staff of United's bitter rivals being involved with his beloved club.",
      "Speaking with The Times about a swathe of City executives making the move to the Red side of Manchester, he said: \"You’ve got Jason Wilcox, Omar Berrada, then there’s others. I don’t think Manchester United should do that.",
      "\"City have been good for the past ten years, so we hope they bring a bit of that, but it’s not what a Manchester United person would want. It’s not what we want and it’s probably not what the fans want either.",
      "“You talk about DNA, there’s nobody there who knows what a Manchester United person is. Darren Fletcher is the only one who knows anything about what it’s like to be a Manchester United player. And look, you don’t always have to be the best player, but you just have to have the balls to be able to play for the club, don’t you?\"",
      "Former team-mate Nicky Butt was also in agreement with Scholes' stance on the matter, explaining: \"It’s unbelievable. Every City staff member goes to Man United now.",
      "\"Real Madrid wouldn’t do it with Barcelona or vice versa. If you have a DNA that’s solid, you should go and handpick the really good coaches — United did that with Kieran McKenna. You see a shining light at Tottenham and bring him in and he teaches you things, but right now there’s no one except Darren Fletcher.\"",
      "Amorim may have bought himself some much needed time ahead of the international break, courtesy of a 2-0 win over a newly-promoted Sunderland AFC on home soil. However, the pressure will continue to mount when United face fierce rivals, Liverpool, at Anfield on Sunday.",
      "However, the head coach doesn't see his job in danger just yet, claiming he has the backing of Sir Jim Ratcliffe and the United board at present. Speaking during a pre-match press conference on Friday afternoon, Amorim said: \"He tells me all the time, sometimes with a message after the games but you know, I know and Jim knows that football is not like that.",
      "\"The most important thing is the next game. You cannot control the next day in football so I know that but it is really good to hear that also because of the noise. Omar and Jason tell me that all the time.\"",
      "He added: \"First of all I can feel it, it is not just that thing that people talk [about]. I feel the support every day. Sometimes the pressure I put on myself and the team is often so much bigger than them. I know it is going to take a while but I don't want to think like that, I said that last year.",
      "\"It is really good to hear that, I think it helps our fans understand that the leadership knows it will take a while but, at the same moment, I don't like that because it will give a feeling like we have time to work things out so I don't want that feeling here in our club. It is good to feel the support but we need to show people, at a big club, we are ready to win games.\"",

      "Few matches mean more to Manchester United fans than their clashes with Liverpool. In recent times, trips to Anfield have not been happy ones for the Reds, regardless of who has been in the dugout.",
      "Their last victory on the red half of Merseyside came in January 2016 when Wayne Rooney scored the winner for Louis van Gaal's side. Despite their poor recent record at Anfield, United have enjoyed better displays there since the 7-0 debacle which plagued Erik ten Hag's tenure at Old Trafford.",
      "Back-to-back draws precede this latest visit to Anfield and United will be hopeful of going one better on Sunday to end their near-ten-year wait for a victory at Liverpool. If they are to come away with the bragging rights, one key decision that Amorim will need to get right is his front three.",
      "Benjamin Sesko and Bryan Mbeumo are almost guaranteed to start. However, the other No.10 position is up for grabs with two players hoping to get the nod: Mason Mount and Matheus Cunha.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "Mount finds himself in pole position to start having scored against Sunderland prior to the international break. Amorim is a big fan of the former Chelsea man and he finally looks to be finding his feet at Old Trafford.",
      "Cunha has yet to get off the mark for the Reds. The Brazilian has shown glimpses of why he was brought to the club but his lack of goal contributions this season needs to come to an end, sooner rather than later.",
      "Some may argue that starting him at Anfield and allowing him the chance to get off the mark against Liverpool would be a vote of confidence for Cunha. But United should be looking to stick with their selection from the win over Sunderland.",
      "Mount is the player with confidence at the moment and he has been given a good rest since the win over the Black Cats given he has been out of the England picture for some time.",
      "Cunha has been on international duty with the Brazil national team this week in Asia and there is no telling what his fitness levels will be after that long flight back to Europe.",
      "A potentially game-changing role off the bench for the 26-year-old could be the smartest option.",

      "Manchester United icon Eric Cantona has already revealed his honest thoughts on the Glazer family and their management of the football club.",
      "The Old Trafford favourite has been linked with a potential takeover at United amid fresh investment talk from the Middle East.",
      "During the international break, takeover rumours sparked when Saudi sports kingpin Turki Al-Sheikh stated an investor was close to striking a deal for the club.",
      "After clarifying that he was not the potential investor, it has since been reported that a UAE-based consortium has contacted several United legends about being part of a possible takeover. Cantona has been mentioned as one of the individuals included, potentially taking up an ambassadorial role that would see him support a prospective consortium.",
      "The Frenchman has been critical of both the Glazers and minority owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe in recent weeks. Back in April, Cantona made a drastic move that spoke volumes about his stance on the current state of affairs at United.",
      "Alongside members of his family, Cantona became the latest co-owner of FC United of Manchester.",
      "The manifesto on the club's website states that they hope to \"create a football club which addresses the concerns which many Manchester United fans have had over the 17 years or more with how the club and football have developed, culminating in the club's takeover by Malcolm Glazer\".",
      "The Northern Premier League club was established in 2005 and is fully owned by its supporters on a \"one member, one vote\" basis, with members voting on all major decisions, such as ticket prices and the design of playing shirts.",

      "His form at Under-18 level prompted interest from Canada in the forward and Jesse Marsch called the teenager into a senior training camp during the summer in a bid to convince him to join the co-World Cup hosts.",
      "Marsch is a big fan of the United prospect, telling reporters in Canada in May: \"He's a dynamic player. He's very good around the goal. You can see he's an intelligent player.",

      "\"I've had good conversations with Gabe and his family. He has several options to think about in what country he wants to represent.",
      "\"I think it's really important that the family feels the connection to Canada.\"",

      "He opened his account in the 25th minute of his first start when he capitalised on a loose back pass from David Heindl to sit the goalkeeper down before rolling the ball into an empty net. Chris Popov snatched a second for the Welsh in the 90th minute.",
      "Biancheri's performance caught the eye in Austria and led to some speculating he could earn a call into Craig Bellamy's senior squad for the November internationals.",

      "Ruben Amorim has been warned that he may not be able to get the best out of Benjamin Sesko with his current set-up.",
      "The 22-year-old arrived at Old Trafford in a £74million transfer from RB Leipzig this summer, with Manchester United pipping Newcastle United to his signature. And while the Slovenian impressed in the Bundesliga, he has failed to make much of an impact in the Premier League.",
      "At present, Sesko has scored just two goals from seven appearances for the Reds, and while he has shown flashes of brilliance, he is clearly still a player in development in one of the most physically demanding leagues in the world. And according to former United star Danny Simpson, history could repeat itself at the club if the striker doesn't receive the right support.",
      "Speaking exclusively to the MEN via MightyTips about United's business this summer, Simpson said: \"I think, right, if we are going to play 3-4-3, which we're doing, and not 4-3-3, which now would suit [Bryan] Mbeumo, Bruno [Fernandes] and [Matheus] Cunha and Sesko - to be honest with you, I think it would - why didn't we buy a centre-mid?",
      "\"You know, let's not pick one of the two, Mbeumo and Cunha. But did we need them both? And you could have had Bruno and one of them and a centre-mid, so Bruno's not playing deep.",
      "\"So, yes, in terms of that, were they trying to get a centre-mid? Maybe they did and he didn't get it over the line - the lad from Brighton [Carlos Baleba], but it was a lot of money. Listen, they brought great players in, but in terms of what we actually need, it's not working right now.",
      "\"Obviously, we prefer Bruno higher. Sesko, I think he will come good, but I just think he also...It would help him to have an experienced striker with him, similar to what's happened with [Rasmus] Hojlund.",
      "“We don't want that to happen again, where it just becomes a point where it's like, so young, it's such a burden, that shirt up front on your own, you've got no help, and before you know it, it's too much.\"",
      "Rasmus Hojlund arrived at Old Trafford in a £72m move from Atalanta in 2023, but failed to live up to his price tag in the years that followed. The 22-year-old managed just four Premier League goals last term from 32 games last season, as the likes of Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Sesko were brought in this summer to give United an attacking edge.",
      "As a result of inconsistency in the north west, Hojlund joined Napoli on a season-long loan this summer, with the Serie A giants holding a £38m obligation to buy the player next year, based on certain requirements being met.",
      "While he is thriving with his new club - with two goals from four games to his name - some fans believe that the issue with his time at United was not having the support of a senior striker to show him the ropes as he continued to develop.",
      "Meanwhile, over in Naples, Hojlund has the likes of Romelu Lukaku and Lorenzo Lucca to impart their wisdom on him both on and off the pitch. It comes as Amorim will hope for more consistency from Sesko when the club return to Premier League action this weekend.",
      "The Reds are currently gearing up to face Arne Slot's Liverpool on Sunday, October 19 at Anfield in the first Northwest derby of the season.",
      "While United won their last top flight clash ahead of the international break with a 2-0 victory over Sunderland, Liverpool are currently suffering a three-game losing streak thanks to losses at the hands of Crystal Palace, Galatasaray and Chelsea.",

      "The former Blackburn talent recognises there's considerable groundwork ahead before landing his inaugural managerial role.",

      "\"Do I think I'm ready to become a manager? No. I'm not naive and daft enough to think I'm just going to walk into a job. It doesn't work like that. I have to earn the right with steps and progression.",
      "\"But do I think I could add value into a team now? Yeah. I played under a lot of good managers and with good players, I've taken a lot of things from various parts of the game on and off the pitch. That's the goal. That's where I want to be. Let's see.\"",
      "Jones has been content to develop his skills within United's youth system and didn't wish to rush into securing a senior position elsewhere before he felt prepared. And he reckons he has gained from that approach.",
      "\"I didn't want to just come out of the game and say, 'I'll take that manager's job',\" he said. \"I wanted to go about it the right way. Just because I played at United for 13 years, you can't expect to get the biggest jobs.",
      "\"I was on the grass with the kids coaching, and you come away from a session thinking, 'How can I adapt, how can I change it, how can I make it better?'",
      "\"You start thinking about the game more. I don't just watch a game of football now, you're engrossed in patterns of play and systems and how they set up tactically in and out of possession.\"",
      "Looking back on his former club's management situation, Jones is encouraged by Sir Jim Ratcliffe's support of Ruben Amorim. Nevertheless, the coach reckons it will mean nothing if the Portuguese manager fails to deliver results.",
      "Jones reckons Sunday's clash with Liverpool could prove pivotal in determining the direction of United's campaign. The former Old Trafford favourite would be delighted to see Amorim claim silverware.",
      "\"Do I want to see any manager or coach losing their job? No, especially with the route I want go down now,\" he said. \"You need time to get your squad together. I like the fact Sir Jim Ratcliffe has come out and backed him, as you would expect. But it's a results business. If you don't get results, I don't care what length of contract you're on – 10 years, two years, five years – there will be questions and you will be looked at.",
      "\"Sunderland (a 2-0 win before the international break) was probably the most complete performance I've seen from United this season in every department. But then you play Liverpool, your fierce rivals (on Sunday). If you don't win there, you've got Brighton coming up and that's not an easy game the way they're playing at the minute.",
      "\"If you get a draw against Liverpool and then go and beat Brighton at home, you've gathered a bit of momentum and can they really kick on and use it as a catalyst to do something? How many times have we said that over the last six years? Would I like to see Amorim succeed, do really well in the back end of this season and maybe win a trophy? Of course. I'd love nothing more.\"",

      "Ben Foster reckons Manchester United supporters ought to be worried by Sir Jim Ratcliffe's commitment to giving Ruben Amorim the full duration of his three-year contract to demonstrate his managerial credentials - despite the difficulties faced during his opening 12 months.",
      "The Red Devils appointed Amorim as Erik ten Hag's replacement last November, but as he approaches his first year in charge, he's secured victory in fewer than a third of his Premier League matches and oversaw United's poorest-ever campaign last season.",
      "This term, despite over £200million being invested in their attacking options, familiar problems remain, and the side find themselves in mid-table having suffered defeats in three of their seven fixtures so far. Amorim's appropriateness for the position has come under scrutiny, particularly given his determination to maintain his philosophy and display minimal flexibility.",
      "However, he continues to enjoy support from the boardroom and Ratcliffe appeared on The Times' Business podcast to emphasise that any hasty decision-making is unlikely to yield superior outcomes. The Ineos chief declared: \"Ruben needs to demonstrate he is a great coach over three years. That's where I would be.\"",
      "But ex-United shot-stopper Foster questioned whether the absence of meaningful progress is being properly considered. He said: \"If I was a Man United fan, I'd be a little bit worried about that because, a club like Manchester United, it's always about progression.",
      "\"You've got to be seen to be progressing and as it stands at the minute they are not progressing. 10th in the league at the minute. It's just the lack of consistency.",
      "\"Obviously, they've won the game against Sunderland now before the international break, but they've got some tough games coming up. Liverpool on Sunday. It's that consistency that they need to find. If they can start to do the three, four, five games winning in a row, then they can really shoot up the table. But as it stands at the minute, it's so hit and miss.\"",
      "Amorim has yet to secure back-to-back victories in the Premier League since arriving in Manchester. United claimed a crucial three points against Sunderland prior to the international break, but now travel to Anfield this weekend, facing an uphill battle.",
      "Victory for Liverpool could intensify scrutiny on the United manager, though Ratcliffe has dismissed speculation surrounding his position following each defeat.",
      "\"The press, sometimes I don't understand,\" he said last week. \"They want overnight success. They think it's a light switch. You know, you flick a switch and it's all going to be roses tomorrow. You can't run a club like Manchester United on knee-jerk reactions to some journalist who goes off on one every week.\"",

      "However, it feels like Amorim will start Mount on the left side in the No.10 role against Liverpool because his work ethic will be hugely beneficial against the Premier League champions in their own backyard.",
      "Cunha has improved that aspect of his game - Wolves' coaches challenged him to improve when not in possession - but he isn't known for working tirelessly backwards and forwards.",
      "That's not to say Cunha doesn't work hard. He has demonstrated his willingness to work his socks off since signing for United, but Mount may be seen as the better option for Anfield.",
      "United is such a big club that rotating a player for tactical reasons can feel like a story - especially if that player is a relatively new signing and was signed for a multi-million-pound fee.",
      "The truth is Manchester City and Liverpool have dominated the Premier League due to their strength in depth. They regularly rotate players and there is no hysterical reaction when a player is benched.",
      "It won't be a big deal if Cunha is named on the bench again this weekend, it would merely be a selection decision made by Amorim to give United the best chance of leaving Anfield with a positive result.",
      "Liverpool are likely to dominate the ball on Sunday afternoon. United will have to work meticulously out of possession, press efficiently and players will have to win their individual battles.",
      "United last won at Anfield in 2016 when Louis van Gaal was in charge and the bookmakers have made Liverpool heavy favourites to win the fixture, but the contest should be closer than the odds suggest.",

      "Casemiro made a beeline for Ruud van Nistelrooy in the Old Trafford tunnel on his return with Leicester City in February.",
      "Van Nistelrooy, a fluent Spanish speaker, was the conduit between Casemiro and Erik ten Hag after his Portuguese-speaking assistant Mitchell van der Gaag left. Van Nistelrooy started Casemiro in all four of his matches as caretaker manager. Casemiro lingered as Van Nistelrooy spoke, as attached to him as a comfort blanket.",
      "At that time, Casemiro had not started for United in 39 days. He did not get a kick between December 30, the night of the Newcastle United debacle, and January 30. He emerged on 70 minutes in Bucharest with United 2-0 up. The transfer window was still open but the chances of United shifting Casemiro were, like the Trinity test igniting the atmosphere, near zero.",
      "People at United's Carrington training complex noticed Casemiro's personality never wavered during a trying first half of the season. They have always found him to be a warm presence.",
      "His transformation at United in the past two months has been as unexpected as their 3-0 triumph in Bilbao. This is the midfielder who was dropped for last year's FA Cup final and replaced by Toby Collyer with United 2-0 down to Liverpool at half-time eight months ago. Casemiro’s declaration that he was keen to see out his contract in March was framed as more bad news for the club.",
      "Casemiro used his head before Athletic lost theirs in San Mames. Returning to Spain emboldens Casemiro. In San Sebastián and Bilbao, he has reminded Spanish audiences he can still cut it nearly three years on from leaving their shores. United supporters serenaded Casemiro on Thursday night.",
      "The draw with Real Sociedad in mid-March has marked a late turning point in Casemiro's third season in Manchester. With Manuel Ugarte out injured, Ruben Amorim had little choice but to turn to the older defensive midfielder.",
      "Casemiro has since been a fixture in the United starting XI, his importance highlighted by the early withdrawal at Bournemouth last week to preserve him for Bilbao. Ugarte admitted this week he is copying him.",
      "Within a matter of months, Casemiro has gone from unsellable to undroppable. If or when United reach the Europa League final, Casemiro is a shoo-in in midfield. The 3-4-2-1 system Amorim swears by has closed the yawning gaps that developed between the defence and midfield under Ten Hag and Casemiro has the safety net of a third centre back.",
      "United have adjusted Casemiro’s running and pressing triggers. “I think he has improved a lot also,” Amorim opined. “You can see not the way he plays but the way he runs. You can see it, we have the data to show him where he worked really hard.",
      "“He is a very good example. Even Toby sometimes was playing in front of him and [that] it is hard to take for Casemiro. So it is a lesson for all the players in Manchester United.",
      "“No matter what is the past or the last month, everything can change in one moment. Then we understood that he cannot jump all the time pressing high. We need to let him understand and sometimes it is better to put three defenders and let him be the fourth defender and put the wing-backs pressing high. These are all things we are understanding and trying to cope with all the criticisms of the team. But the credit is for Casemiro.”",
      "Amorim has been impressed by how hard Casemiro has worked to meet his demands to regain his place in the team. He noticed that he never complained during those winter weeks warming the bench.",
      "Selflessness is a natural trait of Casemiro's. It was also his undoing this time last year. With United depleted at centre half, he dropped back and was humiliated in the 4-0 drubbing by Crystal Palace.",
      "With Kobbie Mainoo and Christian Eriksen a flimsy shield and Jonny Evans his creaking partner, Casemiro abandoned his position to engage Michael Olise, overcommitted, lost his balance and Olise scored. Six days later, he trundled out of the United third and played Arsenal winger Gabriel Martinelli onside to square for Leandro Trossard’s tap-in. Sofyan Amrabat was ushered back in from the cold and played his way into the FA Cup final XI.",
      "Jamie Carragher urged Casemiro to “leave the football before the football leaves you”. Casemiro had been pencilled in to flank Amorim for pre-match press duties against Athletic and he would be a worthy choice at Carrington next week. He is a positive story again and one of the squad’s figureheads. United view Casemiro as a quiet leader, mind.",
      "The 33-year-old shared Raphael Varane’s view that a “disconnect” had developed between the players and Ten Hag. It is not a coincidence that Casemiro scored two goals in the first game after Ten Hag was finally sacked. He was committed enough to claim the last goal of the Ten Hag era at West Ham.",
      "When Casemiro discussed the possibility of joining United, he wanted to know three things: where he would live, where he would train and where the stadium was. During FaceTime conversations, he requested to see the club’s gymnasium at Carrington.",
      "United sources have been struck by how leaner Casemiro is this season. People in Madrid said Casemiro used to be in the club's Valdebebas gym at 8am and he often has gym sessions before and after training at Carrington.",
      "Casemiro has struck up a close rapport with some of the masseurs and his English is now a very good level of conversational. He understood our questions in the mixed zone two years ago, when his handshake grip was as tight as a vice. Casemiro's wife, Anna, and children Sara and Caio, are happy in Manchester amid the prospect of a fourth year in England's north west.",
      "Staff at Carrington regard Casemiro as one of the most respectful players they have encountered and that he is strident in protecting the club's image. Sir Jim Ratcliffe dubbed Casemiro as \"overpaid\" and \"not good enough\" in March. Three days later, Casemiro trumped his first-leg performance against Sociedad in the 4-1 win at Old Trafford.",
      "His steep decline over 18 months - dropped for Amrabat, substituted for Collyer, omitted from the Brazil squad - makes Casemiro’s revival so singular. If United win the Europa League it would be churlish to argue someone who has won three trophies in three seasons has been an unsuccessful signing.",
      "Casemiro drove United to a successful 2022-23 season. Without him, they would not have qualified for the Champions League. Ten Hag dubbed him the “cement between the stones”, essentially the glue in the team. Casemiro was central to the Latino rebranding of the United defence that kept the most clean sheets in the Premier League.",
      "Casemiro has returned to that level of influence he wielded in his first season. In Europe, at least. The concern if United do not triumph in Bilbao again this month is Casemiro could be redundant in a campaign devoid of Champions League midweeks. His recent domestic form has been inoffensive but not stellar and United need a young and dynamic new central midfielder in the summer.",
      "The senior figures made the difference in Bilbao, though. Casemiro and Bruno Fernandes, two 30-something Portuguese speakers, are naturally close.",
      "“We've got a lot of senior players who need to step up in their moments,” Harry Maguire explained. “I think Case was brilliant tonight. Bruno as well. So we have senior players who need to handle these moments really well.”",
      "Van Nistelrooy, a champion of Casemiro’s, merits credit for that.",

      "Liverpool are still one of the most frequent TV picks in the Premier League so far this season, with Chelsea replaced at the top by three other teams.",
      "Premier League clubs received a total of £2.83billion last season, which was comprised of six payments through the division’s ‘central revenue system’, something the Premier League says ‘ensures the most equitable distribution of funds of any major European league’.",
      "Liverpool were paid £174.9m as champions – short of Manchester City’s record £176.2m in 2022/23 – while Newcastle received just over £160m to chuck into their PSR black hole.",
      "Southampton were handed £109.2m for their efforts in finishing a distant bottom. It pays to be in the Premier League.",
      "Some of those payments are fixed. All 20 clubs automatically receive around £96.9m through an equal share distributed based on both the domestic (£29.8m in 2024/25) and international (£59.2m in 2024/25) broadcast deals – those TV rights are lucrative for a reason – as well as £7.9m each from central commercial revenue streams.",
      "The rest is variable, based on where clubs finish and how often their games are selected for broadcast.",
      "",
      "The Premier League merit payments are distributed on a sliding scale from 1st to 20th, made up of combined earnings from domestic and international broadcast deals.",
      "For the 2024/25 season, the difference in prize money was around £2.7m per position. Southampton were given as much for finishing bottom, all the way up to champions Liverpool receiving £53.1m. It basically helped pay for 97.4% of Giorgi Mamardashvili and Jeremie Frimpong.",
      "That can be expected to fluctuate with inflation and other factors – it was around £2.8m per position in 2023/24 – but it offers a rough guide as to what clubs should expect to earn this season.",
      "",
      "1st (Arsenal) – £53.1m",
      "2nd (Manchester City) – £50.4m",
      "3rd (Liverpool) – £47.7m",
      "4th (Bournemouth) – £45m",
      "5th (Spurs) – £42.4m",
      "6th (Chelsea) – £39.8m",
      "7th (Sunderland) – £37.1m",

      "19th (West Ham) – £5.2m",
      "20th (Wolves) – £2.7m",
      "",
      "The only other part of the prize money which is not fixed and shared equally are the facility fees, which are based on how many times each club has been selected for television.",
      "In 2024/25, Liverpool had 30 games televised in the UK, for which they received £24.9m in facility fees. Arsenal had 29 matches and were paid £24.2m, while Manchester United (28 games for £23.4m), Aston Villa (27 games for £22.6m) and Chelsea (26 games for £21.8m) were televised frequently and rewarded handsomely.",
      "Ipswich were shown on the fewest occasions and received £8.9m in facility fees for their 10 live televised UK fixtures.",
      "This can lead to discrepancies in terms of those variable payments. Manchester United’s prize money after finishing 15th last season was £136.2m, more than the four clubs immediately above them – West Ham (£130.9m in 14th), Everton (£131.8m in 13th), Crystal Palace (£136.1m in 12th) and Fulham (£135.5m in 11th) – as Ruben Amorim’s side were picked for far more live TV games.",
      "Spurs were another massive outlier, earning more in 17th (£127.8m) than Wolves did in 16th (£123.1m) in part because they had nine more games picked for live UK broadcast.",

      "",
      "One big change in Premier League prize money going forward is that the 2025/26 season represents the start of a new four-year TV deal cycle.",
      "A new record £6.7bn domestic rights deal will see the number of live games rocket up to 267 of a possible 380, with every Premier League game outside the protected Saturday 3pm kick-offs to be broadcast live.",
      "Their packages include all Saturday 5.30pm, Sunday 2pm and Sunday 4.30pm kick-offs, plus Monday and Friday evening games and three midweek rounds.",
      "Overseas TV rights are worth more than £2bn per year to the Premier League with new deals signed with broadcasters in Japan and Mexico to go alongside lucrative packages in America, Scandinavia, Thailand, China, India and elsewhere.",
      "But the facility fee payments are tied to how many times a team is picked for broadcast by Sky and TNT, with both broadcasters having made their picks up to before Boxing Day. One game generally translates to roughly £0.83m but does fluctuate.",
      "Arsenal, Aston Villa, Crystal Palace, Leeds and Manchester United were the biggest winners from the initial December selections with four more games each.",
      "=1st) Arsenal, Aston Villa, Liverpool and Manchester United (14 games televised live in the UK) – worth around £12.1m in 2024/25",
      "=5th) Chelsea, Nottingham Forest and Spurs (13 games) – worth around £11.4m",

      "These are their approximate dates for when they aim to announce live TV games:",
      "Matches in December and January – by October 15\nMatches in February – by December 17\nMatches in March – by January 21\nMatches in April – by March 4",
      "Games in May are particularly susceptible to being changed at shorter notice as there is a need to see what gaps appear in clubs’ schedules, and frankly so broadcasters can manufacture more drama in races for the title, European qualification or survival.",
      "Arsenal winning 1-0 with a goal from a corner is approaching parodic levels of urine-boiling. Mikel Arteta and his team will not care; this is sustainable.",
      "The Ruben Amorim replacement derby was absurdly entertaining, while Daniel Farke made a quick move to take Ange Postecoglou’s place in the sack race.",

      "Meanwhile, here are possible replacement managers currently between jobs. Pretty much every one of them would have avoided defeat to Grimsby Town, we reckon.",
      "",
      "Although what does need saying here is that there is a wild divergence in opinion on Slot’s job security. He is – entirely absurdly – joint third-favourite in some places. But we’re interested in the best available prices, and on that basis he’s as safe as Mikel Arteta.",
      "But however ridiculous it may sound, there are bookmakers out there who consider Slot’s position to be less secure than anyone in the league who isn’t Ange Postecoglou or Ruben Amorim.",
      "Life comes at you fast when a mini-crisis takes hold.",
      "",
      "An earlier version of this oft-updated piece speculated on what might happen to Mikel Arteta should Arsenal suffer from their Nightmare Start. What if they lost a few early games? What then? We concluded this:",
      "It’s far likelier that Arsenal emerge blinking into the autumn sunshine broadly unscathed from their nightmare horrors. No denying that this season does represent one in which Arteta might completely lose the plot and go entirely off the rails. Or the one where he wins the league by 10 points. Feels like we’re odds-on to get one or the other.",
      "Arsenal emerged duly unscathed, and have already cashed in on the shift to easier fixtures of their own alongside much tougher ones for Liverpool to take top spot in the Premier League.",
      "Only question that remains, therefore, is what Arsenal do from here. We are absolutely certain that it either involves p*ssing the league by 10 points or a complete and total meltdown. Nothing in between. We’re definitely leaning towards the former, though.",
      "READ: Who will be the next manager of Arsenal if Mikel Arteta is sacked?",
      "",
      "Among the least sackable managers in the top flight, and the only club we could really picture trying to lure him away this summer was Spurs and that’s now safely off the table.",

      "Things would have to go unbelievably wrong unbelievably fast, but this is Everton so, you know. Maybe. And there are few things that straddle the blessing-curse divide in football quite like a new stadium.",
      "The benefits Everton should accrue come in the long term. In the short term there’s the loss of familiarity and – something that feels specifically important in this particular case – atmosphere while everyone gets used to the new surroundings.",
      "Defeat at Leeds on the opening weekend was distinctly squibbish, but Everton have bounced back in some style since to suggest they could not just survive but thrive. With Jack Grealish in impish early-season form, they might even be fun. Ending Crystal Palace’s unbeaten run in such dramatic circumstances was certainly that.",

      "It is still very early days and still too early to tell which way a promising-but-not-flawless start eventually breaks for Frank and Spurs.",
      "He arrived to a club and squad with an awful lot of mess to sort out at history’s funniest ever Champions League qualifiers. He appeared to have already thoroughly De-Anged the lot of them only for them to then turn up against Bournemouth and defend like an Ange team while attacking like a Mourinho one.",
      "You know who else won their first couple of games, including one against Man City, after stepping up to Spurs from a smaller but less daft Premier League club? That’s right. But while the Nuno comparisons are obvious, and a world in which Frank doesn’t make the November international break entirely possible, it doesn’t quite feel like the same situation.",
      "Crucially, there has been no undignified scramble to find a new manager this time. Whatever your thoughts on the timing and manner of Ange Postecoglou’s sacking and the identity of his replacement, it’s also clear Spurs have got the man they wanted in a way they very obviously didn’t when Nuno came in.",
      "That surely buys Frank a bit of time even if things do get hairy, which they haven’t done yet. Certainly a few others going to get canned before he does. Probably.",
      "",
      "West Ham at home was a kind start for Sunderland and Le Bris, but boy did they cash in. Came back down to earth with a bump at Burnley, but the late turnaround to beat Brentford plus another win at Nottingham Forest have everything looking peachy. And most sides are going to be pretty happy any time they take a point from Palace this season, we reckon.",
      "Losing at Old Trafford is quite embarrassing, though.",
      "",
      "At various points we’ve expended daft amounts of energy attempting to manifest a ‘Howe Sack’ crisis because we’re messy bitches who live for drama. But we’ve never managed to make it stick even a tiny bit and we started the summer thinking there was little imminent prospect of going for it again with Howe the hero of the Geordie Nation for delivering silverware and more lovely, lovely Champions League football.",
      "Now, though, after a traumatic summer and the Alexander Isak Saga and a sometimes iffy start to the season, our Spidey Sense is tingling once more. We’re going to be right back in the saddle come November after a run of two draws and a defeat leaves the Magpies seven points outside the top six.",
      "",
      "A sacking remains out of the question despite last season’s (relative) struggles. There hasn’t been a Premier League manager since Fergie in his pomp with more credit in the bank than Pep.",
      "But is there still a distinct chance Guardiola decides he’s had enough and simply walks away? We reckon there is, and it’s always worth remembering that we’re talking Next Premier League Manager To Leave here, and that the traditional ‘Sack Race’ shorthand is a bit misleading.",
      "Still, though. Almost no chance at this point that any of that could happen swiftly enough for nobody else to have been canned first.",
      "",
      "Fine end to 24/25 put a different complexion on Brighton’s season than at one time appeared likely. Ending up a clear best of the rest outside the quickly established top seven represented at least a passing grade and they’d have to make a truly awful start to the season to get in any kind of managerial-change bother.",
      "Victory at Chelsea to go with a win over City reaffirms Brighton’s big-boy-bothering calibre, but does also make some of their other results – draws with Fulham and Wolves, for instance – a bit annoying.",
      "",
      "Won’t be sacked, obviously, because Palace are absolutely punching with an elite-level manager who is quietly delivering astonishing results in trying circumstances.",
      "But with reports he was willing and ready to walk out if Marc Guehi was sold without a replacement point to new strains on a relationship that is bound to be tested in the weeks and months ahead.",
      "Nailed it in the Community Shield, but as ever for clubs on Palace’s level there’s a positive-and-negative scale to be balanced by your manager catching the eye so conspicuously. Glasner absolutely could be poached with bigger beasts surely paying attention to the work he’s done at Selhurst Park.",
      "And if that poaching comes from outside the Premier League, then it comes with the possibility of making Glasner the next Premier League managerial casualty. But still very unlikely.",
      "The nerves at Selhurst Park will really kick in if/when Ruben Amorim gets the tin tack.",
      "",
      "The continuity candidate, but how much continuity can there be at Brentford given they’ve sold Bryan Mbeumo, Yoane Wissa and Christian Norgaard, while Thomas Frank took most of the remaining coaching staff with him to Tottenham? It’s a very Brentford move to promote from within but will they be forced into the very un-Brentford move of sacking him in October or November if and when the Bees are in a relegation battle?",
      "Currently benefiting twice from the Ruben Amorim situation, gleefully helping himself to a much-needed win over a man also helping to keep him and others away from the head of this market.",
      "",
      "Burnley really did have a horrible fixture list in these opening weeks under a manager with a horrible record at this level, and were given an opening-day reminder by the team that finished 17th last season of just how much harder the ‘simply don’t concede any goals at all’ tactic is going to be to deliver in the Premier League.",
      "Essentially, Burnley have got back to this level the same way Homer Simpson got to a heavyweight title fight. And Spurs and City have already given them a pummelling.",
      "Victory over Sunderland was an impressive and necessary reminder that it might still be enough against teams more on their level, but Parker will still need some fairly early evidence it can also work against established Premier League teams, which makes Burnley’s start so problematic and that win over Sunderland both vital yet potentially deceptive.",
      "There were encouraging signs before late heartbreak against eternally stupid Manchester United and against champions-elect Liverpool. A point against Forest was certainly a step in the right direction, but they are firmly in the bottom three as we reach the October international break where club decision-makers do start to get antsy.",
      "",
      "Just a slightly less clear-cut version of Glasner really. Not about to be sacked, but could be in the frame for a poaching. And if that poaching comes from outside the Premier League, then he could technically be the next manager to go.",
      "",
      "Wolves absolutely love a sh*tbone awful start and enforced managerial change around November. The loss of key players and a disappointingly limp finish to last season after that thrilling run of wins through March and April mean those old doubts were nagging away even before a woeful pre-season, an opening-day paddling from new-look, old-destructiveness Man City and further defeats to Bournemouth, Everton, Newcastle United and now Leeds.",
      "Pereira should theoretically be fine after the work he did in steering Wolves so comfortably clear of any relegation trouble last season contributed heavily to him being give a new three-year contract in September. But making terrible starts that leave them in apparent relegation trouble before surviving comfortably in the end after a managerial change appears to now be ingrained in the club culture, an issue that transcends players and managers.",
      "Looked set to get the full benefit of good ol’ Dr Tottenham before having to settle for a point that really should have been three; they were much the better side in a low-quality caper.",
      "Sent off in the 1-1 draw with Wolves for ‘irresponsible behaviour in the technical area’. Which we just love. Was he running with scissors? Did he return to a lit firework? Buy some alcohol for some youths?",
      "",
      "One of the key early-season imponderables for 25/26 was just how big and what kind of impact the Club World Cup might have on the way Chelsea and Man City start the season. Would they hit the ground running, or would they be a bit tired and out of sorts? For both, it’s been rather more of the latter than the former.",
      "He definitely still has some hearts and minds to win at Chelsea despite the fine finish to the season that saw them tick off Champions League qualification while completing their collection of UEFA pots and pans and then winning the actual Club World Cup.",
      "A home draw with Crystal Palace wasn’t ideal, but the paddling dished out to West Ham has what really should at least be some kind of halfway credible title bid up and running at least. And we strongly suspect Fulham won’t be the last team left scratching their head after losing to Maresca.",
      "There was some talk of ‘Maresca out’ after a draw with Brentford but that was surely only a minority view. After losing to Manchester United in shambolic fashion, there were more on the bandwagon.",
      "That win over Liverpool was big, though, and a particularly good one for Maresca himself. The second half thumping of Nottm Forest was handy, too.",
      "",
      "Really isn’t that long ago that Emery was listed among your Slots and your Iraolas in this market, but it’s been an alarmingly bleak start to the season for a striving club with lofty ambitions but a worrisome balance sheet.",
      "Missing out on the Champions League in the manner they did at the end of last season was definitely a p*sser, and while Villa were perfectly good last season, it was one that felt a bit flat in the end. It was good, but it could have been great. They could have finished in the top five. They could have won the FA Cup. They could even have knocked out PSG in the Champions League after thar barnstorming Villa Park comeback.",
      "These annoyances are real and meaningful, and have leaked into this season. They are already out of the Carabao and took until the fifth game of the season just to score a Premier League goal that still wasn’t enough to secure a first victory of the season at 10-man Sunderland.",
      "But the win over Fulham was much, much better and beating Feyenoord and then Burnley for four wins in a row feels restorative.",
      "",
      "As a rule of thumb, you really don’t ever want to be this prominent in the Sack Race this early in the season in what is already your second job of that season.",
      "What makes this particularly impressive, in a way, is that Nuno hasn’t really done that much wrong when you think about it. Not at the sort of catastrophic level that would normally be required for such an ‘achievement’",
      "",
      "It would have made Spurs’ decision to sack Europa League-winning Ange Postecoglou look positively kind, but there remains a decent case that Leeds – and Burnley for that matter – could or even should have thanked the managers who secured 100 Championship points and got them back into the big time and then sent them on their way.",
      "Farke had a dreadful Premier League record of only six wins and 26 points from his 49 games in charge of Norwich, a team he twice led to promotion from the Championship with 94 and 97 points.",
      "As well as fighting his own record in this competition, Farke faces the added burden of expectation levels very different to those at just about any other club that could possibly find itself promoted into the Premier League in this current era where that represents the most bittersweet of successes.",
      "Leeds’ lack of firepower against teams wallowing in slightly less despair than Wolves remains a concern, but two wins from the opening seven games to go with creditable draws against Newcastle and Bournemouth ought to be plenty enough to keep Farke gainfully employed, for now.",
      "Definitely worth noting the oddsmakers currently consider this very much a two-horse race at current prices.",
      "",
      "Feels like one could still, if one were so inclined, make the case for him being both top and bottom of this list.",
      "Top because United were staggeringly and at times unwatchably bad last season, as well as bottling the Europa League final in truly dismal fashion against planet earth’s most notorious pot-dodgers, and haven’t delivered anything conspicuously better in the early weeks of this season. Bottom because United have so clearly and determinedly nailed their colours to the Amorim mast that they might just stick with him out of pure stubbornness.",
      "But can he survive defeat to Grimsby Town? Should he? Victory over Burnley helps, but it could scarcely have been less convincing. And my word, they looked broken against Manchester City. We said at the time that the wild 10-man win over 10-man Chelsea was not a turning point; Brentford proved it.",
      "At this point, Sir Jim and his nowhere-to-be-seen pals are probably sitting tight, waiting for a year to pass just to save a few quid on his pay-off. In which case, Amorim and United have a month before both can be put out of their misery.",
      "READ: Who will be the next Man Utd manager if Ruben Amorim is sacked?",

      "On the rare occasion a manager left his post after winning, we will take into account their most recent defeat; we only want results so damaging that the manager in question had to go soon after. To use Frank Lampard’s 2021 Chelsea exit as an example, his final match was an FA Cup win over Luton so the previous game, a 2-0 defeat to Leicester in which Wilfred Ndidi and James Maddison were the scorers, will be used.

      "Graham Potter has followed Jose Mourinho and Sam Allardyce in accomplishing a rare Premier League manager sacking feat after his West Ham exit.",
      "The following is a rundown of the clubs a Premier League coach faced last before losing their job, and the respective managers who were in charge of them. Sackings, resignations and mutual consents are all considered, provided there was one clear result which proved to be the tipping point. And it had to happen during the season, not in the summer.",
      "On the rare occasion a manager left his post after winning, we will take into account their most recent defeat; we only want results so damaging that the manager in question had to go soon after. To use Frank Lampard’s 2021 Chelsea exit as an example, his final match was an FA Cup win over Luton so the previous game, a 2-0 defeat to Leicester, will be used. Same for Daniel Farke, who left Norwich after beating Brentford in November of that year, with the loss to Leeds in his penultimate match cited as key.",
      "",
      "From Ron Atkinson, who induced the first managerial sacking in Premier League history when Chelsea axed Ian Porterfield after a 1-0 defeat to Aston Villa in February 1993, to Oliver Glasner, who forced West Ham’s hand when Crystal Palace beat Graham Potter’s side in September 2025, 61 different coaches have proven to be the last straw for one Premier League manager.",

      "According to transfer expert Fabrizio Romano, Marcus Rashford’s permanent move from Manchester United to FC Barcelona could hinge on one key condition.",
      "In the summer, Rashford joined Barcelona from Man Utd on loan with an option to buy for around £30m.",
      "Barcelona decided to take a punt on Rashford after failing to acquire Nico Williams and Luiz Diaz, with the England international’s versatility and return to form at Aston Villa helping him secure his dream transfer.",
      "This transfer is paying off for Barcelona and Rashford as the forward has three goals and five assists in his ten appearances this season.",
      "Therefore, it currently seems pretty likely that Barcelona will sign Rashford permanently next year, though a report from Football Insider has revealed that there is a ‘stumbling block due to the financial pressure’ at the Spanish giants.",
      "Despite this, Rashford will reportedly ‘quit’ Man Utd even if his move to Barcelona ‘collapses’, with former Premier League chief scout Mick Brown claiming that “there will be no shortage of interest in him”.",
      "“It’s a sad thing from Man United’s point of view that I don’t see him coming back, but I have no doubt there are a lot of clubs keeping an eye on his situation,” Brown told Football Insider.",
      "READ: ‘Petty’ Amorim ‘hate narrative’ debunked as 50 more stars in extended England World Cup ladder",
      "“If he doesn’t stay at Barcelona, there will be no shortage of interest in him, especially if he can keep up the form he has shown.",

      "Romano, meanwhile, claims Rashford “could be open” to having a “different kind of salary structure” to “facilitate a potential move to Barcelona”.",
      "“In all the conversations he has had with Hansi Flick and in all the conversation also internally at Barcelona with people at the club, Marcus Rashford is being very clear his desire is to be a Barcelona player beyond this season,” Romano said on his YouTube channel.",
      "“Rashford is doing very well. He’s very happy with the club, with the coach, with the city, with the teammates, Rashford is loving his life at Barcelona and the idea for Rashford is to try to stay at Barca if they decide to keep him and if they will be able to reach an agreement with Man United, either triggered by their buy option of close to €30 million or to negotiate with United.",
      "“We will see what happens in summer 2026 if Barcelona want to keep Rashford. In that case, my understanding is that Rashford could also be open to have a discussion on a different kind of salary structure compared to his current one at Man United in order to facilitate a potential move to Barcelona.",
      "“Rashford already changed his salary structure in order to join Barcelona, but United are not paying his salary. Barcelona is paying the main part of the salary and the other part is something that Marcus Rashford decided to accept not to take in order to be a Barcelona player this season.",
      "“It’s still very early to predict the future of Rashford, but there is a very good feeling between Rashford, Barcelona and Flick. Obviously we have to see in the second half of the season what happens.",
      "“Nothing will be decided now in October, in November, in December, this is not the time to reach agreements for summer 2026. But the feeling now is very good.”",
      "Manchester United are reportedly willing to ‘agree’ a once ‘unthinkable’ deal on one key condition, while Fabrizio Romano has an update on a transfer.",
      "Keane, Rooney and Neville all believe Rashford should look in the mirror before criticising Manchester United, but his Manchester United was theirs in name only.",

      "Marcus Rashford has been described as “part of the problem” at Manchester United by a legend at the club. He’s not as harsh as Paul Scholes though.",
      "According to reports, Marcus Rashford’s hopes of joining FC Barcelona from Manchester United permanently have been given a new ‘massive boost’.",

      "So there was a call for reply by an Amorim supporter and though that’s not how I’d class myself the fact I don’t want his head on a pike likely means that’s how you see me. Your regular letters bashing United for one thing or another needn’t come with a warning like Stewie’s rants because you can see them coming a mile off, and though this current thorn in your arse regards the academy we all know its rooted in the decision to ditch your messiah Ten Hag 12 months ago. Time to get over that one I think.",
      "However to stay on topic, the talents you’ve singled out are indeed promising players though which Fletcher are you referring to? Them being twins does mean there are two of them. The choice of Lacey and Biancheri seems more about their slight builds than anything, they are still teenagers though so perhaps that always be the case and you only have to look at Amorim favourite Bruno to see that if you’re good enough then size doesn’t matter to him.",
      "The academy does have many other promising players and some might be very well suited to the current system. Where are your comments on Kone, Scanlon, or Ibragimov. The Fletcher brothers could do very well and so too Mantato. Its almost like you chose a few very specific examples to help push your Amorim hating narrative.",
      "You don’t actually care about the progress of these lads at all. We can see this in the total absence of concern for all those previous academy lads that didn’t make it at United. I don’t recall your furious letters demanding United change how they play for the delicate Shoretire and where was your anger for Andreas Periera, James Garner, and Angel Gomes.",
      "When it comes down to it your base argument is backward. The academy exists to produce players that are good enough for the first team. The academy adapts to the first team requirements, not the other way around. If some players make it then great, if they don’t then I’m sure they will have good careers elsewhere, that’s the simple fact of every academy. Trying to twist this into a negative against the current manager who you don’t like is just petty.\nDave, Manchester",
      "",
      "Hi Mailbox,",
      "It’s my view that the pool of England qualified players is deeper than I can ever recall. 10 years or so ago I think it was probably hard to find 50 plausible players to fill the ladder. I thought to myself today – ‘all of those 50 (apart from Phil) are perfectly plausible contenders for an England squad, I wonder whether we can get to 100’. So I tried that.",
      "Short answer is, no I don’t really think there are 100 plausible options there, but there might be 75. I’d be interested to know what others think!",
      "Here’s the list:",
      "51) Liam Delap – given the paucity of non-Harry Kane striking options, Delap will leap way into the top 50 if he can get fit and scoring. Big if, but he has the tools.",
      "52) Mason Mount – we know Tuchel likes him, and understandably so given his excellence in Chelsea’s European Cup winning campaign. Presses well, consummate team man, but significant competition in the attacking midfield means he would need to up his game significantly . This might be difficult in such a dysfunctional side as Man Utd.",
      "53) Benjamin White – has he declared himself available? Not sure. And possibly not getting enough minutes, given the form of the exemplary Timber. But has a great relationship with Saka and can defend well, thus ticking a couple of Tuchely boxes.",
      "54) Rico Lewis – despite being just 20 he has 62 Manchester City appearances and 5 for England, however he hasn’t made a squad for more than a year. He’s a skilled, adaptable operator but the feeling persists that he may be too physically slight for both Tuchel and Pep for his preferred full back and defensive midfield roles.",
      "55) Eric Dier – with 49 caps, he could be a leadershippy, experiencey squad pick in the mould of Jordan Henderson. He’s somewhat versatile and is still playing regularly in Ligue 1 and the Champions League. In a 26 man squad, he wouldn’t be the worst 26th man.",
      "56) Tyrick Mitchell – unlucky to only have two England caps, but could be hampered by playing as wing-back in a back three system that England are unlikely to deploy. He’s been integral for Palace and might deserve a chance in a position that is yet to be definitively claimed.",
      "57) Angel Gomes – a key man for Lee Carlsey, who used his passing skills as a crucial midfield pivot. He’s been surpassed by Elliott Anderson and probably Adam Wharton too, but he is playing Champions League football at Marseille and could be a decent option if required.",
      "58) James Maddison – badly injured, but could he play his way into contention by getting fit and firing by the end of the season? Probably not.",
      "59) Joe Gomez – it’s hard to believe he’s still only 28, but he’s a dependable and versatile defender who rarely lets Liverpool down when called upon. He’s suffered a bit with injuries, but given the form of Konate, I could easily see him getting a run in the Liverpool side, which could precipitate a return to the England reckoning.",
      "60) James Tarkowski – he’s a really good defender, in the head it and block it mould of Dan Burn, and like Burn he’s probably an underrated distributor too. A substantial England career might have passed him by, but I wouldn’t be concerned if I saw him in the squad.",
      "61) Rio Ngumoha – if he were to nail down the spot on the left of Liverpool’s attack, his talent is such that he could challenge Gordon and Rashford for a spot. This will probably happen one day, but it’s unlikely to be this season given he’s just 17.",
      "62) Jamie Gittens – frankly it’s a bit odd that a player signed for nearly 50 million from Dortmund by Chelsea is this low, but I haven’t really seen him do anything much in a Chelsea shirt as yet. Perhaps he’ll explode into life in time to make a late run into squad contention.",
      "63) Tyrone Mings – was thrown into the England Team in Euro 2020 (2021, really) and let nobody down. I can’t really see a repeat happening, especially given Villa’s form, but you never know.",
      "64) James McAtee – the captain of the successful England U21 side in the summer, he’s not really found his feet at Forest yet. He’s a tidy and skilled player, but will have to motor to warrant consideration in such a stacked position.",
      "65) James Garner – playing really well for Everton under Moyes and could definitely be a thought if messrs Anderson, Henderson and Wharton were all to get caught in some sort of freak yachting accident.",
      "66) Alex Scott – same as James Garner, really.",
      "67) Jadon Sancho – what has gone on with him? Chelsea paid money to avoid signing him permanently. Clearly, there is talent there. He showed that when loaned back to Dortmund, but he’s never shown it in the Premiership and that looks unlikely to change at Villa, who clearly only signed him in desperation.",
      "68) Tyler Dibling – a fun player to watch and a sensational dribbler, but currently doesn’t have the end product to truly push himself into contention. I’m not sure that will change this season, but am hopeful it may in the future.",
      "69) Archie Gray – acquitted himself well while playing out of position in a dreadful Spurs side last season, but has only played 72 premier league minutes this time round. A talented player who may go onto win many caps, but I suspect that his time is still to come.",
      "70) Callum Hudson-Odoi – he was stellar for Forest last season, and may even have deserved a return to the England fold, but Forest being quite so poor this time around cannot he helpful. Has the kind of pacy direct profile that Tuchel seems to value.",
      "71) Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall – he’s a nice player and a good signing for Everton. I’d be surprised to see him picked given all the talent in his position.",
      "72) Max Dowman – a generational talent. Unbelievably good for his age. But his age is currently 15. So yeah, bit early.",
      "73) Marcus Tavernier – who is the most unfairly overlooked English player in the Premiership? This guy. Consistently a strong contributor for the excellent Bournemouth, he’s in the top 15% of Premier league attacking midfielders for progressive passes, tackles, and aerials won. Will this be enough to get him in the England squad? Not a chance.",
      "74) Jacob Murphy – on the subject of being overlooked… if it was ever going to happen for Murphy, it was probably last season, where he received no sniff of a call-up despite 8 goals and 12 assists. Unfortunate really, but it’s not going to happen.",
      "75) Jacob Ramsey – Newcastle spent big money on him in the Summer and have wanted him for some time. He moves with the ball very well. However, he’s not really played much in the black and white, so doesn’t seem a likely prospect.",
      "76) Lloyd Kelly – it feels a bit weird that a Juventus first-team central defender is English and yet he is nowhere near the England squad, but here we are.",
      "77) Brooke Norton-Cuffy – funnily enough, he’s also been linked with Juve, and he has been looking a fine prospect for Genoa and the England u-21s. He can certainly get up and down the right touchline with aplomb and might feature one day. But not soon.",
      "78) Max Kilman – he’s been closer to the England team at points in the past. Doesn’t help that West Ham are faintly rubbish.",
      "79) Dominic Calvert-Lewin – his England career is probably a thing of the past. But we aren’t exactly replete with back up strikers, so a decent run of form could drive him upwards on this list. Do I think that’s likely? No.",
      "80) Jobe Bellingham – the lesser Bellingham, but not lacking in talent. He probably needs to stop his dad from bickering with the powers-that-be at Dortmund and put a sustained run of form together. Even if he does, it’s likely too soon for him.",
      "81) Jack Hinshelwood – always looks pretty good at Brighton and quite versatile too. I’d be quite surprised to see that translate into England caps in the short-to-medium term.",
      "82) Fikayo Tomori – if it was ever going to happen for Fikayo, it’s not now. Shame really. He was born in Canada – might be worth exploring that.",
      "83) Josh King – an ever present for Fulham this season and a lovely, balanced dribbler. Definitely too soon for him.",
      "84) Charlie Cresswell – played well for England u21s and a strong player for Toulouse. Probably needed a move to a bigger club if he was going to contend for the World Cup squad.",
      "85) Tyler Morton – playing regularly in Ligue 1 for Lyon and has done well for the u21s. That’s not unimpressive. Maybe one day.",
      "86) CJ Egan-Riley – playing regularly in Ligue 1 for Marseille and has done well for the u21s. That’s not unimpressive. Maybe one day.",
      "87) Omari Hutchinson – Forest signed him for biggish money after a ho-hum season for Ipswich. Looked excellent for the u21s. Doesn’t feel a natural fit for Dycheball if that’s what Forest see-saw into next.",

      "Hi there,",
      "Keir Starmer has condemned the decision by West Midlands Police to ban away supporters from Aston Villa’s home game against Maccabi Tel Aviv . Now, this decision seems to have been taken a) because there is a legitimate fear that protests against Israeli clubs’ participation in sporting events, in a diverse part of an inner city in the UK, could have public order implications, and more importantly b) because the last time these supporters played a fixture in Europe, they committed serious public order offences in Amsterdam.",
      "There are allegations and counter-allegations about the nature of the supporters’ behaviour in Amsterdam, but it seems that Maccabi Tel Aviv supporters were in some cases the victims of racially-motivated abuse and violence, but also, and this is not denied by anyone, also the perpetrators of racially-motivated abuse and violence.",
      "You can have an opinion about whether or not Israeli clubs should be banned from international sporting competition (for the record, there’s a fairly compelling case that Israel have repeatedly violated FIFA and UEFA statutes, and there is the clear precedent of Russia who have been suspended from international competition following their invasion of Ukraine) and you can have an opinion about whether or not this decision is particularly risk-averse, but linking this, as both the Prime Minister and LOTO have, with anti-semitism is prima facie absurd, and actually quite dangerous.",
      "If supporters of an English football club rioted in another European City, and a subsequent European city’s authorities decided that they couldn’t be doing with them, then I don’t believe that the Prime Minister or Leader Of The Opposition would have anything to say about it at all. So why are they making a stand on behalf of supporters of a club from another nation?",
      "Maybe it’s the politicians who should be keeping politics out of football, not footballers past or present?\nDara O’Reilly, London",
      "",
      "Apologies for this, but I need to put my thoughts across on another instance of politics crossing into football so please feel free to stop reading at this point if you’re not interested or cba with it all.",
      "Yesterday my club Aston Villa put out a statement to say that on the advice of the Safety Advisory Group, fans of Maccabi Tel Aviv would not be allowed to attend our match with them in the Europa League on 6th November.  As someone who will be attending the match myself, I welcomed this decision on the basis that it has been made on safety grounds – for those that have never been to Aston, it is a heavily Asian populated area with quite a few mosques so the introduction of a set of fans who have previously been known for racist and aggressive behaviour abroad doesn’t require a lot of mental gymnastics to see how this has got the potential to be a very dangerous situation.  For anyone that isn’t aware, this makes for some very interesting reading.",
      "Now we have various politicians including our very own prime minister chipping in to say that the decision is wrong and “antisemetic” – but is it? Antisemitism is defined as “prejudice or hatred against Jewish people, which can manifest as hostile actions or rhetoric toward individuals, their property, or Jewish community institutions”.  I’m pretty confident in saying that this decision wasn’t taken based on the fact that Maccabi fans are Jewish but instead that a number of their fans are savages that can’t control themselves.  Yes you can station more police at Villa Park but what’s going to happen to the people who live in the surrounding area? How are you going to police every nearby street to ensure public safety? Whether you agree with it or not, there are more than a few houses with Palestine flags hanging from the windows in Aston – how do you see this playing out if/when Maccabi fans on their way to the ground walk past?",
      "To those that say “banning all fans is unfair to those who just want to support their team”, I don’t disagree with you but the moronic element don’t exactly wear badges or uniforms so what else do you do? Matches behind closed doors is one option, but then you’d have to do that for every game Maccabi play in Europe so why even take part?",
      "I honestly and truly believe that this decision has been made in the interests of public safety and for no other reason.  As I type this email, the government are “trying to find a way to reverse the ban” – assuming they are successful in doing so, I expect each and every one of them to be back on TV the following morning to be held responsible for making it happen and the carnage that will undoubtedly follow, which of course they won’t.  This is the equivalent of holding a lit match over a bucket of petrol, it’s really not going to end well at all.\nJeff G, West Brom Villan (Wondering how many of these politicians will be at Villa Park to see the match in person….)",
      "",
      "With the news that the West Midlands Police have decided that no Maccabi Tel Aviv fans will be allowed to attend the Europa league match against Aston Villa for safety concerns, has football now got a major antisemitism problem?",
      "Regardless of your thoughts on the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza and beyond, football is supposed to be a way to unite and bring happiness to the masses. As a football website I won’t delve into the complexities of the terrible conflict.",
      "As a Jewish man in England it appears I am no longer able to attend synagogue without the threat of being murdered, attend an NHS hospital without fear of prejudice and now no longer able to watch football live?",
      "In a country where we debate microaggressions and perceived threat of a national flag, where does actually being barred from attending football sit? As we all know it starts with antisemitism (Jews being the smallest of minorities in England circa 300k) and then other groups will be next…",

      "The winger was deemed surplus to requirements at Man Utd after falling out with Amorim, who reportedly informed him to ‘find a new club’ after the Europa League final loss to Tottenham Hotspur.",
      "Garnacho was criticised for his poor form and attitude at Man Utd, while he struggled to adapt as Amorim implemented his preferred 3-4-3 formation.",
      "Last month, the 21-year-old received a poor reception as Chelsea faced Man Utd at Old Trafford. The Red Devils won 2-1 as the Blues played most of the game with ten men due to Robert Sanchez’s early red card, though Casemiro was later dismissed to level the playing field.",
      "READ: Mbeumo probably furious after ‘secret’ – and also completely pointless – Manchester United mission leaked",
      "Now, Garnacho has commented on Chelsea’s start to this season and claimed that they have had “bad luck with red cards”. He has also claimed that they would have beaten Man Utd if Sanchez didn’t get sent off.",
      "“It’s a hard moment for them [Forest] but you never know in football,” Garnacho said in an interview for Chelsea’s official website.",
      "“They may not have been winning games but they have good players and will want to win. We have to be ready.",
      "“We are in a good position in the league [five points behind Premier League leaders Arsenal], especially after we had a little bit of bad luck with red cards.",
      "“For example, the game against Brighton, we should win that game. And the game at United, if we play 11 against 11, I feel we would be on top.",
      "“But we are okay. I think it’s important to build from the last win against Liverpool and try to win again to be up there.",
      "“I think we have a team that can fight in the league and for the rest of the trophies, and we want to try to win at least one trophy. Because of the moment of the team, of the club, I think we can fight for the big trophies. It’s the dream we have.”",
      "In another recent interview, Garnacho broke his silence on how Amorim treated him at Man Utd.",
      "“I think it was a difficult moment there, just training alone. But I have nothing bad to say about the club, my old club Manchester United,” Garnacho admitted.",

      "There has been significant upheaval at Man Utd over the past couple of years as INEOS chief Sir Jim Ratcliffe has taken control of football operations at Old Trafford.",

      "“The fact that nothing has taken place speaks for itself. Yes, the share price has risen and I’ve been monitoring it myself.",
      "“We’re still at $16, $17, and even that includes a speculative element to it.",

I think it helps our fans to understand that leadership is going to take a while. But at the same moment, I don’t like that, because it will give a feeling that we have time to work things out.",

      "“I’m going to be kind to Mo Salah and we can call it low confidence, but right now his head is scrambled and he is not seeing the clear picture.”",
      "But in his press conference on Friday, Slot pointed out that threat Salah still provided against Chelsea, and in no way suggested he expects more from the forward defensively, despite admitting that a better “balance” needs to be found.",
      "“I saw Cucurella’s comments on Salah but I show you five or six moments where Mo could have made the difference, so that would be a different conversation,” Slot said.",
      "“Always the balance between winger and full-back that is quite… I want ours to attack as well we have to find the right balance. We concede too many crosses, I am aware of that and we have to do better.”",
      "Slot instead said that both Florian Wirtz and Dominik Szoboszlai “are expected to defend” despite being attack-minded midfielders, putting the responsibility on them to cover for Salah rather than putting the defensive burden on the guy he knows is Liverpool’s game-changer.",
      "There’s nothing quite like a game against United to break Salah out of a funk – he’s got 16 goals and six assists in 17 games against the Red Devils – and two goals to send Egypt to the World Cup while becoming the all-time leading goalscorer in African World Cup qualifying won’t have done his confidence any harm.",
      "But Slot’s apparent refusal to alter the defensive expectations of his star man offers United and Amorim an opportunity to prey on the same weakness which saw Alejandro Garnacho and Cucurella get so much joy at Stamford Bridge last time out.",
      "Amorim could plump for either Matheus Cunha or Mason Mount as his inverted winger on that side, but the key man for the Red Devils could be Patrick Dorgu, who has shown some promise this season as a raiding left wing-back and could get some real joy against whichever right-back Slot and Salah hang out to dry.",
      "Mohamed Salah was reportedly ‘amazed’ at the ‘atmosphere’ at one of the stadiums he has played at this season, and asked a former rival “is every match like this?” in ...",
      "A pundit has hit out at Mohamed Salah over his “terrible” start to this season, while Arne Slot “misses” one former Liverpool star.",
      "‘99% of players, when things aren’t going well for them, we understand that it’s fine as long as they work hard. But he seems to walking around in a daze.’",
      "Alan Shearer thinks Liverpool forward Mohamed Salah is currently “suffering” as the Reds attempt to find the right balance after a big summer spend.",
      "Arne Slot has plenty to think about during the international break and should probably consider dropping the Liverpool hero after Marc Cucurella’s revelation…",
      "Here are the 10 current favourites for the Premier League Golden Boot with Erling Haaland disappearing over the horizon already."

      "Football finance expert Kieran Maguire has spotted a “false flag” amid rumours of a Man Utd takeover attempt by a UAE-based consortium.",
      "Saudi Arabian boxing promoter Turki Al-Sheikh caused a stir amongst the Man Utd fanbase last week as he claimed a potential takeover of the club was ‘advanced’.",
      "Al-Sheikh wrote on X: ‘The best news I heard today is that Manchester United is now in an advanced stage of completing a deal to sell to a new investor – I hope he’s better than the previous owners.’",
      "But Al-Sheikh had to clarify his comments after speculation that he or another Saudi was involved in the potential takeover in some way.",
      "Posting again the day after, Al-Sheikh wrote: ‘My yesterday’s post about Manchester United’s potential sale meant one thing: the club is in an advanced negotiation phase with a new investor.",
      "‘Just to clarify, I am not the investor, nor are they from my nation. I’m posting this as a fan who wishes the deal to happen, though it might not necessarily happen.’",
      "READ: Rashford backlash from Keane, Neville and Rooney based on *their* Manchester United, not his",
      "There have since been rumours that a UAE-based consortium have had a ‘meeting’ with Man Utd officials in London over a potential deal to buy the club from the Glazer family.",
      "It has been revealed that the drag-along rights included in the INEOS minority takeover means Sir Jim Ratcliffe could be forced to sell his shares if a new bidder for the club emerges.",
      "Football finance expert Maguire has cast doubt on the takeover rumours, he told United In Focus: “I think if the Glazers had wanted to sell at $32 per share for the whole club, then they would have done so.",
      "“The fact that nothing has taken place speaks for itself. Yes, the share price has risen and I’ve been monitoring it myself.",
      "“We’re still at $16, $17, and even that includes a speculative element to it.",
      "“So the comments from Turki Al-Sheikh are intriguing, but the club has responded with a fairly heavy ‘no’, and given that it’s listed on the New York Stock Exchange, it’s got to be cautious about what it says publicly.",
      "“So I think it’s a bit of a false flag that we’re seeing. If somebody wanted to get involved in a bid then Twitter’s not the best place to put out that information.",
      "“So you do wonder about the motives of some of the people involved.”",

      "Journalist Ben Jacobs gave a comprehensive update on the potential takeover earlier this week, insisting that the Glazers have yet to receive an offer from any party.",
      "Jacobs said on The United Stand: “So the latest is as follows: number one, the Glazers have not had an offer from anybody.",
      "“Could they be holding talks behind other people at the club’s back? Absolutely. Are they advanced? No. And then where does the money come from? Well, Turki Al-Sheikh confirms something that we broke on this show, that it’s not Saudi Arabia.",
      "“I don’t want to disappoint the chat, but Sheikh Jassim is not coming back to the table. There is no possibility, I am told. And in addition to that, the number the Glazers want is in excess of 5 billion pounds. And if you go back through the SEC filing to look at the different bids from shape, none of the offers were anywhere close to that number.",
      "“And what makes the number higher is if, whilst this drag on clause is valid, the Glazers do sell. So Jim Ratcliffe is guaranteed $33 a share, which takes the overall valuation of the club to something around 4.7 billion.",
      "“So again, not far off that 5 billion pound number. And all of this means, if someone’s to buy the club now, they’re going to have to pay a premium, and then Sir Jim Ratcliffe would have to go buy a wanted 100% so there’s a few variables here.”",
      "Jacobs added: “The last thing, and the most interesting thing that I can add, and I think this counts as a bit of a United Stand exclusive, is that within the UAE, one company in particular is involved in these talks.",
      "“It’s unclear whether they will front the consortium, but international holding company or IHC, which has been around for about three decades, have been part of talks to put together a perspective of a UAE-based Consortium.",
      "“We don’t know whether anything is going to materialise. And as we said on talkSPORT a few weeks ago, some ex-Manchester United legends have also been sounded out not to invest, but just to be ambassadors.",
      "“And quite interestingly, some, I think they’ll be excited to others, I think they will almost feel the optics of this are not quite right because of the kind of personality he is. One ex-Manchester United legend in particular has held direct talks about maybe coming on board.”",
      "Jacobs continued: “I would just stress one thing really, clearly, it is nowhere near as advanced as Turki implied, nor have the Glazers had any kind of direct contact.",
      "“Yet there’s no guarantee this even develops into anything. But Eric Cantona is one of the names that has been approached.”",
      "A takeover of Man Utd could be ‘advanced’ but not in terms of the UAE-based consortium making a bid for the club, according to journalist Ben Jacobs.",
      "Some Man Utd legends have been ‘approached’ by a UAE-based consortium looking to buy the club from the Glazers, according to reports.",
      "Man Utd officials are holding a ‘meeting’ today with a UAE-based consortium who are ‘very serious’ about buying the club, according to reports.",
      "It could be in the Glazer family’s interest to sell Man Utd ‘before February 2027’ amid takeover rumours, according to reports."

      "As former Manchester United players continue to ‘hit back’, ‘dismiss’ and ‘baulk’ at suggestions from Marcus Rashford that his boyhood club was the problem and not what they perceive to be a lack of effort on his part, we wonder just how brilliant the England international will have to be for club and country for the not-so-merry band of Red Devils pundits to side with him over the club they’re ordinarily willing to concede has become a laughing stock since their playing days.",
      "Rashford impressed for Aston Villa on loan in the second half of last season and has three goals and five assists for Barcelona so far this term. After some all too predictable knee-jerk media nonsense claiming the La Liga giants were considering sending him back to United after his first couple of appearances, a narrative about-turn now sees Rashford’s displays as proof of the rotten core of the football club he departed in the summer.",
      "That’s a far more difficult concept for your Roy Keanes, Gary Nevilles and Wayne Rooneys to accept though.",
      "Upon upping sticks for Barcelona in the summer, Rashford claimed United were in “no man’s land” and that “the transition hasn’t started”, which riled Neville.",
      "“Let’s ignore that,” Neville said. “Because I don’t want to go into Marcus Rashford comments tonight. He was there at the club for 10 years and had his opportunity to impact the club. Ruben Amorim, this year, I think will do a good job. Marcus should concentrate on Barcelona.”",
      "Keane then questioned whether Rashford had the “intelligence” to succeed at Barcelona, asking: “Do you reckon he’s got enough football intelligence to go over there and adapt to a different league, different football, different lifestyle? Has he got that intelligence on and off the pitch to make it work?”",
      "The evidence so far suggests that Rashford does indeed have the required football nous to thrive at Barcelona, and while we may feel the need to caveat that as a result of a career beset with false dawns and inconsistency, all of that instability coming while playing for Manchester United allows for an easy hypothesis, as drawn by the man himself in response to Thomas Tuchel’s claim that the only think preventing Rashford from being seen as a world class talent is his lack of consistency.",
      "“For sure, consistency is a massive part of it,” Rashford said. “I feel like I have been in an inconsistent environment for a very long time, so it is even more difficult to be consistent.",
      "“When people talk about consistency, in order to be consistent in anything, not just sport, you need consistent variables in your life and the way you train. We have just had so many changes so far in my career.”",

      "Neither Keane nor Wayne Rooney, both captains of Manchester United, who led by example through their work ethic as well as their quality at Old Trafford, can conceive of a situation where the environment at their football club has turned so sour as to cause a player like Rashford to not be putting in the maximum amount of effort week in, week out.",
      "“Towards the end of his time at United, there was obviously issues. He was part of the problem with the environment, especially one of the most experienced players at United,” Keane said in response to Rashford’s comments.",
      "“He should have been setting the standards and showing new people at he club what it’s like to be a United player. But that’s been well documented. What we have to look at is he’s got this chance now with England and he deserved it.",
      "“No doubt about his talent, he’s obviously fantastic. But the bit that would have frustrated fans is his body language, not running back or not pressing properly. That’s the things he needs to tidy up and if he does there’s no reason he can’t become a world class player.”",
      "Rooney agreed with Keane, claiming Rashford should look at himself in the mirror rather than blaming United.",
      "Speaking on the latest episode of The Wayne Rooney Show, he said: “I think the environment hasn’t been right but that is down to yourself.",
      "“If you are not playing well or you get left out of the team then I think it is easier to blame the environment and whether that is right or wrong. I think that comes from how you apply yourself.",
      "“In games we have seen with him where we know he can do more, we know he can run more – that is nothing to do with an environment.",
      "“I might be wrong here, I really like Marcus as a lad and as a person but I think that is an easy one to throw at people.”",
      "But none of these United legends, who won countless major trophies in an atmosphere where they all drove each other to excel and improve, experienced anything like the lethargy, mockery and bleakness that Rashford had to endure at the club. His Manchester United was their Manchester United in name only.",
      "And they’re perfectly willing to accept that when discussing results, performances, problems with the manager, the directors and the general ethos of the club. But weirdly can’t then see how all of that upheaval might result in a footballer struggling for consistency.",
      "It makes us wonder a) how consistent they might have been in the last decade at United rather than the two before, and b) whether any level of brilliance from Rashford at Barcelona will be enough for them to admit that United was the problem and not him.",
      "According to transfer expert Fabrizio Romano, Marcus Rashford’s permanent move from Manchester United to FC Barcelona could hinge on one key condition.",
      "Rooney say Rashford blaming Man Utd for his “inconsistent” displays is an “easy” excuse and told the England international to look in the mirror.",
      "With one sentence, Roy Keane proved that he is basing his opinion on Djed Spence on something other than actually watching him play.",
      "Marcus Rashford has been described as “part of the problem” at Manchester United by a legend at the club. He’s not as harsh as Paul Scholes though.",
      "According to reports, Marcus Rashford’s hopes of joining FC Barcelona from Manchester United permanently have been given a new ‘massive boost’.",
      "In 15 damning words, Rashford summed up his struggles at Man Utd and why Sir Jim Ratcliffe hasn’t already sacked Ruben Amorim."

      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe clearly doesn’t rate the Manchester United academy and Ruben Amorim has an inflexible system, so there is concern over three young stars.",
      "Send your thoughts to theeditor@football365.com.",
      "Since we’re nearly back to the real football, just been reading some reviews of how players did at U21 level, because while Sir Rat doesn’t think the academy is producing the goods, there’s actually a good number of very exciting talents, particularly Fletcher, Lacey and Biancheri.",
      "The latter two are particularly interesting, being that one is a winger and the other a small agile finisher in the mould of Aguero.",
      "And so, thoughts turn to how they get a passage into the first team. If there’s any staunch Amorim supporters about, I don’t suppose you’d care to share a view? Y’know, in the context that we don’t now use wingers (maybe Lacey can be adapted to the 10 but there’s 6 ahead of him) and there’s a general preference for tall and strong strikers.",
      "I’m afraid it goes back to the issue of a system requiring and using only certain types of player, without ability to accomodate or adapt to the talents available. Where would Scholes, Giggs or Beckham have fitted into this set up if they were breaking through now? Neville as a CB?",
      "Anyhoo, answers on a postcard or BTL very welcome.",
      "If the answer is “they just have to wait until this guy is sacked” that’s fine, but Lacey is 19 and needs to get a path to senior football soon. Which has vibes of “ones that got away” when we sell him to probably Newcastle or Everton on the cheap.\nBadwolf",

      "I’m going to start this by being very clear. I like Thomas Tuchel. Lots.",
      "But equally, it is becoming abundantly clear that you lot (our wonderful media, and even F365 possibly included) do not. You don’t like him, you didn’t want him, and that narrative is being driven and reinforced on, what seems like, a daily basis, and at every conceivable opportunity.",
      "And that raises a justifiable question. Why??",
      "I’m too old and too grumpy to take too much notice of WCQ game stats, but the man has overseen a 100% win record with no goals conceded. And before anyone says “yeah but, these groups are a joke, full of part timers etc etc, just maybe have a word with your most accessible Sweden or Italy fan, and ask them how it’s going.",
      "Tuchel is quite clearly, a decent, educated, well spoken (even when not using his native tongue) and most importantly, very successful football coach. So, what’s the problem with him?",
      "So far with the media, he has been open, honest, forthcoming and, more importantly, consistent about what he is trying to do and how he is trying to do it. Why not take the man for his word? Don’t forget, he has a very short-term contract, with a very clear target.",

      "Tuchel has made them balanced on both wings and made them fly. Oddly he’s leaning intelligently on Newcastle’s team while Sven was stuck with Manchester United’s Ferguson dripping poison in the ear of his boys for the England squad. Howe is nurturing a good set of hard working players in his squad that compliment what Tuchel needs. Gordon running up the left wing is a pleasure to finally see happen. What might have been against Spain in 2024? And he scored! Woltemade is a perfect sort of striker for Gordon as a proxy for Kane.",

      "There have been an interesting range of comments in recent mailboxes on Harry Kane, some focussing on his goalscoring prowess whilst others felt his barnet required closer evaluation (…“he’s a nifty, 50’s binman !” (© Shooting Stars..)).",
      "So I thought I would jot down a few thoughts from an older England fan’s perspective.",
      "There can be no doubting of the man’s goal-scoring prowess – that is undeniable and he remains one of the most clinical finishers around, as he has been for a number of years.",
      "However, I start to feel slightly more uncomfortable with certain messaging that I hear from parts of the media when they eulogise about his build up play, with it almost being painted that he should be allowed to do that because … because he’s Harry Kane ! .. record England goal-scorer … he can do what he wants !",
      "The guy can clearly play some great, incisive passes (an aspect of his game that has come more to the fore in the last few years), but that doesn’t mean he should be given full licence to drop into those positions away from the forward line for England to attempt that. What was clearly evident at the last Euro’s (where there were lots of calls for him to be dropped from the starting 11 during the tournament, me being one) was that he stodged up our build up play by dropping deep.",
      "I also think we need to recognise that one of the areas where England have a high talent pool relative to the world stage is at the number 10 / attacking midfield position – Rogers has had the shirt in the last couple of games, with the likes of Palmer, Bellingham and Eze patiently waiting (Palmer is the pick for me – such an intelligent footballer in terms of his ability to find pockets of space and defining attacking patterns of play). It would be disappointing to me if all 4 of those names don’t make the plane to the US.",
      "So, back to the job demarcation point. For me, Tuchel should be telling Harry that he wants him to play as a number 9 that predominantly plays within the width of the penalty area and in the attacking line. That should be his job, to finish the chances created by others – think of it like a Gerd Muller role who was one of the best there has been in terms of finding the onion bag, but who had a very talented German team behind him to give him those opportunities.",
      "If Kane could adopt that narrower role for England, I think it will improve our overall chances of success.\nSparky, LFC (liking what Tuchel is doing .. refreshing to see the manner he has selected squads / teams in recent times .. regardless of reputation, everyone needs to earn their place .. I can get behind that).",

      "I understand that it’s the interlull and everyone is bored but I thought the Neville/Flag War debate would be over on Football365 even though it raves in elsewhere.However, the initial article was very left wing and condescending to right wing readers in order to stir the pot and encourage readers to react. So, as much as I held back, here’s my tuppence worth.",
      "Now, Neville has every right to say what he said. Also people have the right to disagree with him. What’s amusing is that Neville in his dramatic video appears to be using ‘mirror politics  i e. having a go at ‘angry middle aged white men’ causing division when that’s exactly what he is.and what he’s doing (especially in Salford). Can’t he just express his views rationally father than impersonate Richard Ashcroft with his remix of ‘Bitter Sweet Symphony? I think Jaap Stam sums him up in his autobiography by calling both the Nevilles ‘busy c**ts’ implying they are both angry people who complain about this, that and everything! Also, Neville’s timing of his comment linking it to a degree with a  terrorist attack on Jews was inappropriate and wrong",

      "1. Remove heading from the game. We know it’s terrible for kids’ brains, it’s probably not great for adults’ brains. It adds so little. In fact, only ~15% of premier league goals are headers. I think taking away defenders’ option to head the ball clear would increase the number of goals, at least initially.",
      "2. Remove penalties from the game. Foul in the box is just like a foul anywhere else. If an obvious goal is stopped a la Suarez v Ghana, just award a goal.",
      "3. Stop the clock when the ball is out of play. Everyone whinges about time-wasting. I read article after article about the ball only being in play for ~54% of time blah blah blah. Just make the game 60 mins and stop the clock. Add a “restart play” of 15s for throw ins, 30s for corners/free kicks in the attacking half.",
      "4. Ditch automatic VAR. Give the manager “challenges” like tennis or NFL, but you lose a sub if you get it wrong. Let them challenge ANYTHING; absolutely believe that throw in was the wrong call? Bet a sub on it. No subs left but you’ve just conceded a final minute winner that you think is bullshit? Too bad, you should have managed your challenges/subs better.",

      "The Premier League is back! Well done, everyone, another international break survived. And now very nearly a month to luxuriate in delicious Barclays before the next one comes along. Lucky us.",
      "The football gods have seen fit to grant us a special treat this weekend as Liverpool and Manchester United bring their current very real if very different crisis experiences to an Anfield showdown that can only end with at least one team in the very deepest despair, while there’s plenty of other good stuff to be found around the country and indeed continent.",
      "And look at that, Ange Postecoglou is still here, just about. Who’d have thought it? Not us.",
      "Big Weekends always feel that bit bigger after a whole fortnight away, but this one would be worthy at any time of the year.",
      "",
      "We don’t know much about the fixture computer. We like to think it is in fact a kind of giant piece of factory machinery. In our heads, it is basically Bertha. In reality, it’s probably just a laptop, isn’t it?",
      "That’s very boring. We prefer to think of Bertha spitting out the fixtures, thank you very much. What we do know, of course, is that the fixtures computer is a mischievous scamp with a keen sense of humour.",
      "And we wonder whether it has some kind of ‘post-interlull’ setting. Because, god bless it, the fixture computer always seems to deliver a proper big bastard of a Super Sunday primetime game as a little treat to us all for surviving the barren fortnight.",
      "It was the Manchester derby in September. Next month, it’s the North London Derby. And now, we get the really big one. El Crisico. Mini-crisis v maxi-crisis. Liverpool v Manchester United.",
      "Bertha, you are spoiling us.",
      "It really has come at an ideal time for absolutely everybody apart from Liverpool and Manchester United. Whoever loses, we all win.",
      "Either Liverpool’s mini-crisis gets upgraded, or Manchester United once again miss the chance to find that elusive second successive Premier League win in a row under a manager who has openly admitted the inability to do something as basic as win two Premier League games in a row is now living in their head. Not rent-free, Sir Jim would never allow that. But it’s there nonetheless.",
      "Or, and this feels most likely given Liverpool are suddenly quite unsure of themselves and Manchester United aren’t very good, neither of them get the perspective-altering win they need and it’ll be a draw like it has been in each of the last two seasons. And that’s no good for either of them, really.",
      "It is, in short, the perfect game to headline the first weekend back after the international break.",
      "",
      "Back-to-back home Premier League wins over Fulham and Burnley to go with a couple of welcome early successes in the Europa League have significantly lifted a previously gloomy mood at Villa Park.",
      "With Villa and Forest – about whom more later in the most obvious possible way – we’ve seen almost sarcastically perfect evidence of how the Europa League can work for good or ill for a struggling team.",
      "You can be Aston Villa, and see the Europa League help you get that winning feeling back, restore some confidence and watch that flow through rejuvenated players who suddenly see that Thursday-Sunday schedule as more opportunity than chore. Or you can be Forest, and have European competition simply represent the opportunity to be humiliated and embarrassed twice a week instead of just the once, exacerbating and further highlighting all the obvious and, let’s be fair, largely self-inflicted problems you currently face.",
      "It is definitely better to be Villa. Having thus been able to enjoy the interlull, as much as any of us can, on the back of a far more encouraging set of results than had previously been the case, now comes crunch time.",
      "Have Villa actually turned a serious corner, escaping from the funk that had enveloped them since such a costly missing out on Champions League football at the end of last season? Or have they just had a couple of winnable Europa games chucked in with a couple of quite gentle home Premier League games?",
      "Villa’s trip to Spurs on Sunday afternoon should tell us a fair bit about both sides. A pre-collapse Tottenham spangled Villa 4-1 at WHL 2.0 last November, but since that result they have a truly astonishing home record in the league. And not in a good way.",
      "They have won only three of 17 Premier League games at their own stadium in the 11 months since handing Villa that beating, with only teams as thoroughly outmatched as Southampton and Burnley or as thoroughly ridiculous as Manchester United failing to leave with anything at all.",
      "Even this season, one in which Spurs appear far less silly than in recent years, they have managed only four points from home games against Burnley, Bournemouth and Wolves while taking 10 points from their four away games.",
      "This is a big chance for Villa. There is perhaps no better fixture around at the moment for sitting right in the sweetspot of one where a positive result would feel like compelling evidence that things have decisively changed for the better while also being a game where such a result is relatively straightforward to obtain.",
      "",
      "It’s him until it isn’t. Still doesn’t have a win, still somehow does have a job, probably won’t if he can’t cobble together some kind of a result against Chelsea. Probably won’t cobble together some kind of a result against Chelsea.",
      "Watching Nottingham Forest this season has already reached that uncomfortable stage where you feel quite bad about even looking, like you’re intruding on something deeply personal.",
      "Maybe we really should all just… not watch. Let them work through whatever this is they’re going through in some kind of peace.",
      "Instead, we’re making Ange Postecoglou our manager to watch, again, because it is just so horribly fascinating to see, in real time, something go horribly wrong that everyone knew would go horribly wrong in the exact way – on, if anything, an accelerated timeline – it is going horribly wrong.",
      "",
      "There’s something about Gyokeres that is just unbeatably Modern Football. Not him as a player, but as a concept. In Gyokeres we have the clearest example yet of a player who had been judged, weighed and measured before he arrived at Arsenal. Battle lines were drawn, a culture war declared, and nobody will budge.",
      "He is either the final piece in the puzzle or a massive flop. No other outcome will be considered or tolerated, and most importantly nothing he actually does or doesn’t do on the pitch will shift anyone from the opinion that they formed and hardened and crystallised before he’d even worn the shirt.",
      "Goals he does score are either given far greater significance than they truly merit, or are ignored altogether, depending on your position.",
      "One criticism we’ve heard a bit already, and expect to hear more of, is that he scores the Wrong Goals. It’s entirely possible he’ll become the first Premier League flop to score 20 goals in his debut season.",
      "It’s a clever ruse, because initially it sounds quite reasonable when a Troy Deeney or some other such loud radio opinion-haver says he needs to score in a ‘big game’ or that Arsenal didn’t sign him to score late gloss-adders in 5-0 wins over Leeds.",
      "But it’s just guff, isn’t it? Sure, at some point it would be good to see him score in a ‘big game’ against ‘top opposition’. But the idea that Arsenal signed him specifically to do that and only that is, when given even a second’s actual thought, bumwash. Obvious bumwash at that.",
      "And this weekend’s trip to Fulham is in fact a textbook example of precisely the kind of fixture they also really need him to make a difference.",
      "Arsenal haven’t failed to win any of the last three league titles (only) because of not winning all the games against the best teams. It’s (also) because of points dropped at places like Fulham.",
      "Arsenal haven’t won here in either of the last two seasons, and Fulham haven’t lost here this season. Something to bear in mind there after Gyokeres’ winning goal this weekend is airily dismissed a fortnight down the line as the wrong kind of goal by those who’ve already made up their minds.",
      "",
      "The fact the three teams promoted into last season’s Premier League and then instantly sent packing back to the Championship were so very wretched was disastrous for last season’s top-flight relegation battle, but is already proving a significant boon for this season’s Championship promotion fight.",
      "Relegated teams should, very obviously, have a huge advantage when stepping back down in class. Off the field with your parachute payments and such, and on the field where even decimated squads will still contain the occasional gleam of Premier League sparkle.",
      "But none of the three teams who went down last season are in any kind of position to now set about dominating the Championship, with the result that an already unpredictable division is now more wide open than usual.",
      "Coventry and Middlesbrough are a pleasingly early Carling pair of potential Premier League returnees currently setting the pace, but there is only two points separating Leicester, who sit third despite themselves, and Bristol City down in tenth.",
      "Between them sit a whole bunch of clubs trying to get back to the top flight after absences of various degrees and those hoping to enjoy a delicious foaming pint of Barclays for the very first time since football was invented all the way back in 1992.",
      "The pick of Saturday’s lunchtime crop pits one from each camp against each other in a London derby as QPR host Millwall. Two places but a single point separate them going into the weekend, and for both sides there exists a tantalising chance to take first-mover’s advantage and jump through this currently tightly-packed bunch in and around the play-off spots.",
      "",
      "Der Klassiker is always a key moment in any Bundesliga season, but this one already carries significant weight. It’s very early but still feels very correct to say this is a game that will tell us whether or not there is any prospect of an actual title fight in Germany this year, or simply a Bayern Munich procession.",
      "Bayern have made a ludicrous start to the season, winning 10 straight games in all competitions and scoring a truly absurd amount of goals in the process. Luis Diaz has scored five goals in his first six Bundesliga games for the club, and that’s as many as anyone from any other club in the division has managed this season. It’s still not half as many as Harry Kane has plundered.",
      "Only three of the other 17 Bundesliga clubs have managed more than the 11 goals Kane has to his name, and Dortmund with 12 just about join that collective.",
      "More significantly, or at least Dortmund must hope, they have conceded only four goals in their six games. It’s not quite the unstoppable force meeting an immovable object, but it does represent a stiffer domestic challenge than a Bayern attack that has scored at least three times in each of its six straight league wins this season has thus far encountered.",
      "A win for Dortmund closes the gap at the top of the table to a single point and makes things interesting. The far more likely outcome, another goal-laden Bayern victory featuring a Kane penalty or three, will see the champions move seven points clear of Dortmund, at least six clear of anyone else, and disappearing once again over the horizon.",
      "READ NEXT: Kane, Haaland and Mbappe share secrets behind absurd World Cup Golden Boot and Euro Golden Shoe race",
      "Liverpool are still one of the most frequent TV picks in the Premier League so far this season, with Chelsea replaced at the top by three other teams.",
      "Arsenal winning 1-0 with a goal from a corner is approaching parodic levels of urine-boiling. Mikel Arteta and his team will not care; this is sustainable.",
      "The Ruben Amorim replacement derby was absurdly entertaining, while Daniel Farke made a quick move to take Ange Postecoglou’s place in the sack race.",
      "Erling Haaland has been a Premier League player for barely three seasons but has already outscored a legion of legends and is firing Norway to the World Cup.",
      "Ange Postecoglou’s Forest reign goes down as the shortest-ever in Premier League history. Great news for Les Reed…",
      "Nottingham Forest’s players buried Ange Postecoglou by showing the same old failings against a Chelsea side there for the taking."

      "\"Sometimes you need to look at the bigger picture and as a group of players we believe that the manager can help this club to get back where it belongs.\"",

      "🔴 Amorim's system could trouble Liverpool💪 Merino showing his value to Arsenal🔍 A player to watch this weekend",
      "Ruben Amorim's system continues to dominate the discourse around Manchester United. His devotion to playing three at the back has come to be seen as a flaw but it might just work in his side's favour when they face Liverpool on Super Sunday.",
      "Arne Slot's side, on an uncharacteristic run of three consecutive defeats, tend to find playing against back threes more difficult.",
      "The issue has been most apparent against Crystal Palace, one of few other Premier League sides who habitually deploy a back three. Liverpool are winless in three games against them if you throw in the penalty-shootout defeat in the Community Shield in August.",
      "Even the five Premier League games Liverpool have won against back threes since the start of last season, away at Crystal Palace, Southampton and Burnley and at home against Wolves and West Ham, have been nervy affairs settled by one-goal margins.",
      "Manchester United have of course caused problems for Slot's side too, securing a 2-2 draw on their last visit to Anfield in January, when they used their wing-backs to create overloads in wide areas in a performance described by Gary Neville as their best under Amorim.",
      "They will return to Anfield as underdogs on Sunday. Amazingly, Manchester United are yet to win back-to-back Premier League games under Amorim. But their last visit offers a blueprint to follow and they typically fare better in these kinds of assignments.",
      "In fact, in Premier League games in which they have had less possession than their opponent under Amorim, Manchester United's win rate is nearly twice as high as when they have had more, while their loss rate drops from 64 per cent to 25 per cent.",
      "The numbers are of course influenced to some extent by game-state. A team holding a lead is more likely to relinquish possession, just as a team trailing is more likely to have more of it as they try to open their opponent up and find a way back into the game.",
      "But the trend is not unique to Manchester United.",
      "Since the start of last season, Premier League sides using back threes have had less possession, on average, in games they have won and drawn compared to the games they have lost.",
      "It supports the argument that a back three is a reactive system, and at its most effective, at least in most cases, when used as a means to absorb pressure and spring forward quickly using transitions.",
      "Whether it is the right approach for a club of Manchester United's stature in the long-term is debateable. On Sunday against Liverpool, though, it probably offers their best hope of getting a result.",
      "The 29-year-old made it six goals in four appearances for Spain with his double against Bulgaria on Tuesday. Only Erling Haaland and Memphis Depay have scored more times in European World Cup qualifying. Merino's tally is equal to Harry Kane's.",
      "His eye for goal is not new. Merino has scored 16 times in 35 games for club and country since his late double in Arsenal's 2-0 win over Leicester in February, when he was pressed into the role of striker for the first time following an injury to Kai Havertz.",
      "The positional change proved transformative for Merino, who had never previously played up front. But his goals for Spain have come from midfield and so did his latest for Arsenal, the headed equaliser in the late victory over Newcastle at St James' Park.",
      "Merino excels at timing his runs into the box. \"He can smell danger,\" said Mikel Arteta in February. But his extraordinary aerial threat, showcased again with his headed double against Bulgaria, is not his only weapon when it comes to finishing scoring chances.",
      "Spain's Luis de la Fuente uses the same term. \"He is so complete, we are lucky to have him,\" he said. Merino's value to Arteta is similarly clear. But it is fair to say perceptions externally are not universally positive. He continues to be mischaracterised as a defensive player, his selection seen by some as a symbol of conservatism.",
      "Merino is not a fleet-footed creator in the mould of Eberechi Eze or Martin Odegaard, that is true. But he would not be starting every game for Spain if he lacked technical ability and his off-the-ball qualities are invaluable in pressing opponents high up the pitch.",
      "Goals are of course the most important currency of all and, in Merino's case, it is worth noting context as well as volume.",
      "He counts Liverpool, Chelsea, Newcastle, Real Madrid, France and Netherlands among the teams he has scored against over the last eight months. His eight Premier League goals have won Arsenal twice as many points as any other player's.",
      "It all adds up to make him vitally important to both club and country, despite fierce competition for places on both fronts. It would be no surprise to see him show his value again at Craven Cottage.",
      "Donyell Malen was Aston Villa's match-winner as his double clinched a 2-1 victory over Burnley in their last game and he added another goal for Netherlands during the international break.",
      "He has had to be patient since arriving at Villa from Borussia Dortmund in January but looks ready to belatedly make his mark in the Premier League with Spurs next up on Sunday.",
      "Last week's column examined Mohamed Salah's dip for Liverpool and why he's missing Trent Alexander-Arnold. There was also a look at Arsenal's formidable defensive numbers this season and Graham Potter's unceremonious end at West Ham.",

      "Aston Villa are unbeaten in the last 10 Premier League games after an international break, winning eight. Whatever Emery does in this fiddly time for managers is working wonders.",
      "Meanwhile, Spurs' encouraging start to life under Thomas Frank has been somewhat undermined by a pair of disappointing results in their last two Premier League home games after being battered by Bournemouth and only drawing with Wolves courtesy of a last-minute equaliser. It means Spurs have won just three of their 17 Premier League home games since November last year.",

      "There's a real chemistry brewing here.",
      "Amad and Mbeumo might not have been the attacking duo many expected to define this United side, but their movement and understanding has been electric and could just be the catalyst for Ruben Amorim.",
      "At 9/2 to score with Sky Bet, the value's there on Amad.",
      "And against a Liverpool side that's been anything but watertight down their left flank, this looks the perfect storm for the United hotshot to make a big statement.",
      "Liverpool will, as always, dominate territory and possession but that only increases the space Amad can exploit on the counter. Pair that with his on-field connection with Mbeumo and United have the tools to create more problems for Liverpool, who do look short at 4/7 with Sky Bet for maximum points.",
      "West Ham are in 'season-defining' territory already.",
      "The Hammers are winless in eight home Premier League games, a run that played a huge part in Graham Potter losing his job. It's their longest winless run since moving to the London Stadium and, in its current miserable guise, the place feels a world away from Upton Park.",
      "When you're knee-deep in a relegation scrap, you don't need talk of 'underlying numbers' - you need street-fighting survival football. Nuno Espirito Santo brings exactly that.",
      "Call it what you want - reactive, pragmatic and at times boring - but it's effective when backs are against the wall. West Ham need points and Nuno will bag them plenty based on his body of work. The home win looks the call here at 29/20 with Sky Bet.",

      "Cristiano Ronaldo is on track to reach an unprecedented scoring milestone but when he could hit his 1,000th goal? Between the Lines returns for a bonus edition to break down the numbers.",
      "Ronaldo set yet another scoring record when he became the outright top scorer in World Cup qualifying history with his double in Portugal's 2-2 draw against Hungary on Tuesday night.",
      "The goals put him on 41 from 51 World Cup qualifying games, moving him clear of the previous record-holder, former Guatemala striker Carlos Ruiz on 39, with Lionel Messi third in the list on 36.",
      "Ronaldo has now scored a record 143 goals in 225 games for his country in addition to 805 in 1,068 games at club level, putting him on a staggering combined total of 948 career goals.",
      "Ronaldo turned 40 in February but he continues to rack up impressive numbers at club level as well as internationally, albeit against weaker opposition in Saudi Arabia, where he has scored 104 goals in 117 appearances across four seasons with Al-Nassr.",
      "With 32 goals already for club and country in 2025, he is maintaining a remarkably consistent level of productivity in front of goal. Ronaldo has averaged more than 50 goals per calendar year since 2010.",
      "His highest scoring year came in 2013, when he smashed 69 goals and won the Ballon d'Or. Amazingly, his total has only dipped below 39 goals once in a calendar year in the last decade and a half.",
      "It seems there's a lot more to come from him too.",
      "With Portugal set to qualify for next summer's World Cup, and with two years to go on his Al-Nassr contract, Ronaldo is projected to become the first player in recorded history to reach the 1,000-goal mark in October 2026 based on his current scoring rate.",
      "Ronaldo's opening goal against Hungary was his 181st with his weaker left foot. His second was his 608th with his right.",
      "His double demonstrated his all-round threat attacking threat and Ronaldo is of course similarly dangerous aerially, with 157 of his goals, roughly 17 per cent, having come with his head.",
      "His goals have been split relatively evenly between home and away and neutral venues. His tally includes 178 penalties but he has also scored 135 times from outside the box, including 64 direct free-kicks.",
      "By competition, the biggest share of his goals has come in LaLiga, where he scored 311 times across nine seasons with Real Madrid.",
      "He remains the top scorer in Champions League history with 140 goals and also found the net 103 times across two spells in the Premier League with Manchester United.",
      "His favourite opponents, in terms of which sides he has scored the most goals against, are all based in Spain, with Sevilla, in particular, grateful to have seen the back of him.",
      "Ronaldo smashed 27 goals in just 18 appearances against the Andalucian side, with Real Madrid's bitter rivals Atletico and Barcelona also featuring high up in the list.",
      "Tottenham rank as his favourite English opponent, with Ronaldo having scored 14 times in 20 games against them, while Luxembourg are his favourite opponent internationally.",
      "On 948 and counting, Ronaldo's quest for 1,000 goals continues.",
      "On the subject of goalscoring, Monday's Between the Lines looked at England's reliance on Harry Kane and the worrying lack of other options. Where are all the English No 9s?",
