      "Marcus Rashford will encounter a familiar face as he looks to revive his best Barcelona form this weekend(Image: Joan Valls/Urbanandsport/NurPhoto via Getty Images)",
      "Marcus Rashford can't escape his Manchester United past as the England forward prepares to square off with a familiar face. The Barcelona loanee will return to action in La Liga on Sunday when Hansi Flick's side host Real Oviedo, hoping to improve his standing as doubts supposedly emerge over his future in Catalonia.",
      "And that encounter teases the prospect of seeing Rashford go up against former team-mate Eric Bailly, who has been on the books in Asturias since last summer. The Ivorian completed a free transfer to Oviedo after his contract with Villarreal expired and is currently in a dogfight to keep the club among Spain's top tier.",
      "Oviedo currently sit bottom of La Liga, while Rashford's Barca are one point ahead of Real Madrid at the summit. And the Blaugrana will expect to enforce their will upon the relegation favourites, who who are seven points from safety.",
      "Bailly, 31, has played a fairly minimal role in their return to the top flight and made just five league appearances to far this season. However, there's a risk he may not be a part of manager Guillermo Almada's squad after missing their last two games.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UTD FB PAGE! Latest United news and more on our dedicated Facebook page",
      "Even if he isn't named as part of Oviedo's squad, Bailly may still make an appearance in the stands for one of the biggest games in their season. Rashford, meanwhile, is aiming to rediscover his best Barca form after grabbing just one goal and one assist in their last seven league outings.",
      "Bailly, who made 113 appearances across six seasons playing at Old Trafford, holds Rashford in high regard. And the defender named the Englishman as one of the players who \"blew him away\" following his arrival at United.",
      "\"I knew a lot of great players in Manchester,\" he said after joining Marseille on loan in 2022. \"But if I have to talk about everyone who impressed me, we're never going to finish this interview! There was incredible talent, both old and young. Someone like Marcus Rashford really blew me away.\"",
      "Bailly played the full 90 minutes when Oviedo visited the Camp Nou back in September. The hosts ran out as 3-1 victors on the day, and the veteran centre-back was carded in injury time.",
      "Rashford and Eric Bailly spent six seasons as team-mates at United(Image: Vachira Vachira/NurPhoto)",
      "Rashford scored Barca's consolation goal during a 2-1 defeat to Real Sociedad last time out in La Liga. He also assisted in a 4-2 Champions League win over Slavia Prague on Wednesday, but reports have suggested the Catalans have reservations over his future.",
      "It had looked like his form earlier this season would be enough for Barcelona to trigger the £26million purchase option in his loan deal. The Athletic reported bosses are concerned regarding the efficacy of his defensive work, a key demand of attacking players in Flick's system.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "Rashford ranks high in his willingness to run and press opposition defences while without the ball. However, the figures indicate he's on the lower end of the scale when it comes to successful tackles and dispossessions.",
      "He'll look to prove otherwise this weekend, and Bailly could be among his direct obstacles in the event both play at the Estadio Carlos Tartiere. Rashford could in turn have a hand in sending his old colleague closer to relegation, while Bailly hopes to help Oviedo claim an almighty upset and revive their hopes of survival.",

      "Casemiro is leaving Manchester United this summer(Image: PA)",
      "Manchester United's announcement that Casemiro will leave Old Trafford at the end of the season is a clear sign the club are planning ahead for the summer transfer window. It emerged this week that the Brazilian veteran, 33, will depart this summer when his contract expires after four seasons with the club.",
      "United decided not to extend the five-time Champions League winner's enormous £350,000-a-week deal, having signed him in August 2022 during Erik ten Hag's tenure. Casemiro has featured in 146 matches and scored 21 goals for United thus far, with Michael Carrick's eventual managerial successor set to lose an experienced voice in the dressing room.",
      "However, his exit will provide an opportunity for a much-needed midfield rebuild given the space it frees up on United’s wage bill. United bosses were reported to be targeting midfield acquisitions this summer even prior to Casemiro's announcement.",
      "At the heart of midfield, there are two contenders to take over from Casemiro in Wharton, 21, and Baleba, 22. Brighton's Baleba was a well-documented target for United last summer. The club examined the terms of a potential deal but the transfer never came to fruition.",
      "Another prime target is Crystal Palace's Wharton, who could become the latest player to look to depart the south London outfit, with the club aware of the England international's ambition to compete in the Champions League.",
      "With Wharton valued at over £60m and more than £100m needed to persuade Brighton to part with Baleba, the former seems the more shrewd option, particularly given Baleba's underwhelming campaign so far. The physically dominant Cameroonian would represent more of a direct replacement for Casemiro but Wharton's Carrick-esque presence in midfield would signal an evolution in the role for United.",
      "The matter of who would play alongside Wharton is more complex given United already have academy product Kobbie Mainoo. Yet, there is one exceptional player whose displays this season indicate the club must secure him at any cost - Nottingham Forest's Anderson.",
      "Elliot Anderson [L] and Adam Wharton [R] would be two top signings for United(Image: 2025 the FA)",
      "Forest have no intention of selling the England international, 23, and competition from Premier League rivals would certainly drive up Anderson’s price, which is being reported as around £75m-£100m. But the all-action midfielder would be worth every penny as a statement signing and one who would instantly elevate the side.",
      "Should that move collapse, however, Wolves' Gomes - priced at £35m-45m - would represent a solid alternative. The Reds have been monitoring the Wolves talent since the summer as they look to bolster their midfield.",
      "That leaves the attacking-midfield position left vacant by Fernandes’ hypothetical exit. Matheus Cunha would be the favourite out of the current crop to take on the role as chief creator, though Chelsea’s Cole Palmer has recently been named as an ambitious potential signing.",
      "Cole Palmer is reportedly homesick(Image: Photo by Darren Walsh/Chelsea FC via Getty Images)",
      "United supporter and former Manchester City player Palmer has established himself as one of the Premier League's finest players since his Chelsea move in 2023 but reports the playmaker is 'homesick' in London and might pursue a move closer to his home - Manchester.",
      "That certainly works in United's favour, with Palmer's wages also not thought to be a problem. However, the 23-year-old could cost a Premier League record fee close to the £150m mark, making his signing unrealistic.",
      "Instead, Cunha would likely step into Fernandes’ shoes in the case of his departure, with United able to sign Gomes from Wolves as a third midfield reinforcement. That could leave United’s midfield looking like this at the start of the 2026/27 season:",
      "Starters: Adam Wharton, Elliot Anderson, Matheus Cunha.",
      "Depth options: Manuel Ugarte, Kobbie Mainoo, Mason Mount, Joao Gomes.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Casemiro will depart Manchester United as a beloved figure by both fans and team-mates(Image: Ash Donelon/Manchester United via Getty Images)",
      "Casemiro's Manchester United journey will come to an end this summer after confirmation emerged that he'll depart when his contract runs out. The Brazilian will leave Old Trafford with his reputation intact, having been one of the few bright spots during a challenging era for the Red Devils.",
      "The former Real Madrid stalwart shared a heartfelt tribute video on Instagram on Thursday, reflecting on his three-and-a-half years at the club. Club captain Bruno Fernandes was quick to respond, writing it \"was a pleasure playing alongside you.\"",
      "Current and former colleagues joined in the outpouring of appreciation, with Diogo Dalot, Altay Bayindir and Sergio Reguilon all posting applause emojis. Joshua Zirkzee simply wrote \"crack,\" an alternative spelling of \"craque,\" which in Portuguese signifies an exceptional talent.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UTD FB PAGE! Latest United news and more on our dedicated Facebook page",
      "This latest round of praise reflects the consistent admiration Casemiro has enjoyed during his spell in England. Arriving at United as a five-time Champions League winner with Real Madrid, the midfielder brought an aura of authority that commanded immediate respect.",
      "Shortly after Casemiro's arrival at Old Trafford, Harry Maguire lauded his colleague following an FA Cup victory over Reading, telling MUTV: \"Cas is a top player and has been a top player throughout his career.",
      "\"You don't win what he has won without being that and playing every game in the success that he has had for club and country. He is an amazing player and an amazing character, more importantly. To have him around the place lifts the morale. In and out of possession he has really improved us.\"",
      "Just a month later in February 2023, Luke Shaw emphasised what an \"extremely important player\" the Brazilian was for the squad: \"I think it's been quite obvious to see how important he is to the team when he's not been playing.",
      "\"For us as defenders, he gives us that feeling that we know there's a lot of security, especially because of his positioning, where he always is. He loves to win the ball back and tackle. We always say to him that he likes to give the ball away so he can go and win it back!\"",
      "It's evident Casemiro quickly built strong bonds at Carrington based on his team-mates' glowing testimonials. Despite a challenging second campaign at Old Trafford, the South American has been an essential component throughout most of his near four-year spell with United.",
      "He netted the club's first goal in the 2023 Carabao Cup final victory over Newcastle, securing the inaugural silverware of his United journey. Marcus Rashford was full of praise at the time, crediting him with making life simpler for the attacking players: \"He makes a huge difference for us.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "\"His leadership and experience in big games is essential. Speaking to some of the other forward lads, we have all said that when he is on the pitch, we can all feel the sense of security behind us, which is so important. I'm buzzing for him today.\"",
      "Casemiro has been instrumental in any United success of late, helping them clinch both the League Cup and FA Cup during his tenure. Despite already having an illustrious career before joining, he will depart as a club legend, having consistently elevated standards at Old Trafford.",

      "Marcus Rashford's future remains a source of intrigue(Image: Getty Images)",
      "Questions continue to swirl around Marcus Rashford's future following the managerial change at Manchester United. Rashford's Red Devils career appeared to be over after his fallout with Ruben Amorim, which resulted in him being excluded from the first-team squad and loaned out to Aston Villa before moving to Barcelona.",
      "However, Amorim's dismissal has potentially changed the situation. Michael Carrick, who has both played alongside and coached Rashford, will be hoping to do enough work to secure the position permanently come summer.",
      "United are still thought to be eager to cash in on Rashford, whose Barcelona loan arrangement includes a purchase option for around £26million.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UTD FB PAGE! Latest United news and more on our dedicated Facebook page",
      "Barcelona boss Hansi Flick recently commended Rashford's \"really good\" displays this season but confirmed no decision had been made regarding a permanent acquisition. Other clubs will certainly be monitoring the situation, although remaining with Barcelona would be his preferred choice.",
      "Given the 28-year-old's contract runs only until 2028, that £26m fee would realistically drop over time, making the upcoming window an ideal opportunity to maximise returns, especially considering his homegrown status for PSR purposes.",
      "United have reportedly shown interest in Barcelona midfielder Marc Casado, who is understood to be open to a Premier League switch.",
      "With Casemiro's summer departure confirmed and Manuel Ugarte also linked with an exit, the position sits at the top of their transfer wishlist. This opens up the prospect of a potential swap arrangement involving Rashford. With both players carrying comparable valuations, a deal could potentially be hammered out in the summer.",
      "However, this would depend on Casado remaining a Barcelona player at season's end. The 22-year-old is being monitored by Atletico Madrid, who are seeking a midfielder following Conor Gallagher's sale to Tottenham.",
      "Marc Casado is interested in playing abroad after struggling for game time at Barcelona(Image: Icon Sport via Getty Images)",
      "This would essentially be delaying the inevitable but remains a possibility and might make greater financial sense for Barcelona.",
      "Another season-long loan could be arranged with an obligation to purchase in summer 2027. The stumbling block in this scenario would be determining the exact fee. Given the £26m figure has already been established, accepting significantly less would make little sense from United's standpoint.",
      "On the flip side, it does once again remove his substantial £325k-a-week wages from the books for another year, creating room for some vital summer acquisitions.",
      "Rashford is happy at Barcelona(Image: Getty Images)",
      "Despite Amorim's departure, this still appears the most unlikely outcome. Rashford has made it evident he is content at Barcelona, while a complete separation from United may be best for both sides.",
      "Nevertheless, a comeback cannot be completely dismissed following the managerial change. The next permanent boss, whether it's Carrick or another candidate, may look to bring the forward back into the fold.",

And with Marc Guehi joining Manchester City and Jean-Philippe Mateta now agitating for a move, there is a chance to Wharton could be the next high-profile player departure.",

      "While the champions are admirers of Wharton, their focus in the transfer market will be on adding a central defender after missing out on Guehi back in the summer. Tottenham's Micky van de Ven is another Premier League star they are keen.",

      "The result means that Villa have already qualified for the last 16 of the competition with a game to spare. Sancho's header in the 25th minute was enough to seal all three points in Istanbul, and he was a constant threat until Emery brought him off in the closing stages.",

      "Michael Carrick has made his feelings clear on Jadon Sancho(Image: David S. Bustamante/Soccrates/Getty Images)",
      "Michael Carrick thinks highly of Jadon Sancho after working closely with him during his first temporary spell in charge back in 2021. The former Manchester United captain has taken on an interim head coaching role at the club until the end of the season following Ruben Amorim's sacking.",
      "With just the Premier League left to focus on, Carrick will likely take a look at some of the forgotten Red Devils out on loan from the club. One such name is Sancho, who is currently plying his trade at rivals Aston Villa.",
      "The Villans sit in third place in the league table for now after a stellar first half of the season. However, Sancho has had to wait before making an impact in the Midlands.",
      "The winger is yet to register a goal contribution in the league and was sidelined due to illness for their 1-0 loss to Everton at the weekend. But he came up trumps in Europe, scoring the winning goal as Villa won at Fenerbahce in the Europa League.",
      "Previous loan spells at former club Borussia Dortmund and Chelsea helped the 25-year-old regain some form, but he has rarely been seen in a United kit since his public row with ex-boss Erik ten Hag.",
      "However, the out-of-favour winger may find a way back into Old Trafford through Carrick who was complimentary of Sancho during his first spell in charge in 2021. Following Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's exit, the ex-midfielder was handed a caketaker managerial position, recording two wins and a draw from three games.",
      "Sancho scored in Carrick's first game in charge, a Champions League clash away to Villarreal which United won 2-0. The temporary boss was full of praise for the young winger afterward as he said: \"To finish it off, Jadon was brilliant.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UTD FB PAGE! Latest United news and more on our dedicated Facebook page",
      "\"I know how much Jadon loves the ball at his feet and trying to make things happen, it’s where he’s happiest. But on the other side of the game, he put a real effort in defense and it was a big night for him.\"",
      "Reiterating his importance in the game, Carrick added: \"I was so pleased for Jadon. I thought he worked his socks off tonight, I thought he gave everything tonight.",
      "\"At times, it wasn't always with the ball and I know how much he enjoys the ball at his feet and trying to make things happen. He showed a different side tonight and, to get his goal at the end, pretty much capped it off perfectly for him and for us.\"",
      "Jadon Sancho has plenty to consider(Image: Julian Finney/Getty Images)",
      "These comments speak volumes to the potential Carrick saw in Sancho in 2021 and may hint at a possible return to glory for the winger at the club. United could let the 25-year-old leave on a free in the summer when his contract expires.",
      "It is understood that United are angling towards cutting their losses with the winger to avoid paying his salary for another year if he is not wanted.",
      "However, Carrick's influence may play a part in fashioning a return for the forgotten star - or even proving to make him more attractive to potential suitors.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Michael Carrick is planning for life after Casemiro(Image: Neal Simpson/Getty Images)",
      "Manchester United are reportedly ready to open talks with Kobbie Mainoo over a new contract following the news that Casemiro will leave in the summer. It was confirmed on Thursday that United would not be extending Casemiro’s contract and he will leave after four years with the club.",
      "United plan to overhaul their midfield at the end of the season, when a new long-term managerial appointment will be made. Casemiro is 33 and is one of the club’s highest earners, on around £350,000-a-week, having joined for £60million from Real Madrid in 2022, and doesn’t fit into the future plans.",
      "The opposite is clearly the case with Mainoo, who is 20 years old and a graduate of United’s famous academy. Mainoo’s future at the club was uncertain while Ruben Amorim was still in charge, and he was keen to leave for Napoli in January, but the arrival of Michael Carrick as interim manager until the end of the season has brought about a complete U-turn in his fortunes.",
      "Having not started a single Premier League match all season under Amorim, Mainoo was thrust into the starting line-up for Carrick’s first game. United beat Manchester City 2-0 in the derby and Mainoo’s stock has immediately shot up.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UTD FB PAGE! Latest United news and more on our dedicated Facebook page",
      "That reported wage makes him one of United’s lowest earners and has been a source of frustration for the youngster for some time. It has previously been reported that Mainoo has asked for £200,000 in order to put pen to a new deal.",
      "Whatever happens with Mainoo, it is clear that United will undergo a major revamp of their midfield in the summer, with Casemiro leaving and doubts remaining over the future of captain Bruno Fernandes. United are interested in signing Brighton’s Carlos Baleba, Crystal Palace’s Adam Wharton and Nottingham Forest’s Elliot Anderson, among others, but their transfer business will likely depend on who comes in as the new manager.",
      "Kobbie Mainoo could sign a new deal at Manchester United(Image: Neal Simpson/Getty Images)",
      "In the meantime, Mainoo looks set to play a key role in the remainder of the season with Carrick calling the shots. The interim boss is a huge fan of Mainoo’s and believes he has been misused as a deeper-lying midfielder.",
      "\"I think he's more of an attacker. I don't see him as a holding midfielder. He's probably that line above with that little bit more freedom,” Carrick told Rio Ferdinand last summer. \"I think there are different ways of defending. You can defend on that higher line a little bit, but defending right deep around your centre back is a bit of a different thing.",
      "\"I've seen him playing a little bit higher with that freedom and creating and taking the ball. I think he's got a massive future. I really like him, I think he just needs a bit of patience and that little bit of break again, which I'm sure he'll get. He's got it, and he's shown that.”",

      "The Dutch giants want to bolster their squad with a new No 6 and are admirers of Ugarte, who has struggled to replicate the form that convinced United to pay Paris Saint-Germain £42million for his services back in the summer of 2024. But after seeing a proposal to loan the midfielder knocked back, Ajax are now considering other options.",
      "Among them is Norgaard, according to De Telegraaf, even though the Denmark international who only joined the Gunners from Brentford back in the summer.",
      "Norgaard has had a dearth of first-team opportunities, though, with Arsenal hitting their stride in the Premier League. He's made just three appearances of the bench in the Premier League this term and played as an emergency centre-back in cup competitions.",
      "Wataru Endo of Liverpool and West Ham's Edson Alvarez are other players Ajax could target in their search for an experienced midfield enforcer.",
      "While Ajax may be interested in trying to lure Norgaard to Amsterdam, Arsenal are unlikely to entertain the idea of a mid-season exit for the former Brentford star as they challenge on all fronts for silverware. Mikel Arteta also recently described him as one of the best trainers at the club.",

The former United midfielder, who was named the club's interim head coach until the season's end this month, dedicated the final 12 years of his playing days at Old Trafford, proving instrumental in securing 12 major trophies.",
      "His United journey commenced in 2006 when Ferguson secured an £18.6million agreement to lure him from Tottenham Hotspur. Carrick was 25 when he switched to Manchester and had already accumulated considerable experience, amassing 145 Premier League outings with West Ham United and Spurs.",
      "He'd also earned multiple England caps before putting pen to paper. However, with only an Intertoto Cup success with the Hammers to show for his efforts, Carrick was short on silverware – in stark contrast to his new United team-mates at the time.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UTD FB PAGE! Latest United news and more on our dedicated Facebook page",
      "Carrick revealed: \"He said, 'come in my office for a chat', and I'll never forget, I sat down like this really and was kind of nervous and trying to catch my breath really. I was 25, kind of established, played for England, and I was massively affected by just sitting across from him.",
      "\"He said, 'yeah this is Man United son, you'll love it. We do things differently, people expect things differently here and people look at you different when you're at Man United and when you're used to winning. The pressures are different.'",
      "Sir Alex Ferguson set out Manchester United's expectations to Michael Carrick(Image: PAUL ELLIS/AFP via Getty Images)",

      "It is almost two years since Sir Jim Ratcliffe acquired his stake in Manchester United(Image: UEFA via Getty Images)",
      "For one of the richest businessmen in the world, Sir Jim Ratcliffe appears to be facing unusual financial worries. According to many reports, there is the small matter of his Ineos petrochemicals empire carrying a debt burden of £18billion.",
      "No wonder Sir Jim - a legendary penny-pincher at the best of times - has been cost-cutting with some gusto. On the business front, three factories in Germany are going, along with a facility in Ohio. Twenty percent of the workforce at a plant in Hull were made redundant late last year.",
      "On the sporting front, Ineos have pulled their involvement in America’s Cup sailing and ended a sponsorship arrangement with the All Blacks. There were recent claims that Ratcliffe has slashed the £170million asking price for his controlling stake in OGC Nice, currently fourth from bottom of the Ligue Un table.",
      "But if Ratcliffe wanted some really jolting financial news, it came with the publication of Deloitte’s annual Football Money League. The long and the short of the figures is that, in a 12-month period that takes in the 2024/25 season, mighty Manchester United collected a revenue total that was less than SEVEN other clubs in Europe and THREE other clubs in the Premier League.",
      "United should be THE money-generating powerhouse in English football and on a par with the likes of Real Madrid, Barcelona and Bayern Munich. Instead, United’s revenue was over £300million LESS than Real Madrid’s - £692million to £1.013billion.",
      "It was £159million less than the amount generated by Barcelona and £59million less than Bayern Munich earned. Liverpool (£729million), Manchester City (£723million) and Arsenal (£717million) are all ahead of United in the revenue table.",
      "Michael Carrick got his spell as Manchester United coach off to a flying start in the derby at Old Trafford(Image: Getty Images)",
      "Now, some of the reasons why United are in a relatively lowly spot in the financial rankings need context. The stadium brings in 70,000-plus but does not maximise matchday revenue and of the top eight in the table, only Arsenal have a smaller wage bill than United.",
      "But there is a brutal truth about United’s place in this financial table - a truth that has only been heightened since Ratcliffe acquired a 27.7 percent stake in the club for £1.25billion in early 2024. United’s mediocrity on the field of play means their financial pre-eminence in European football has been badly damaged.",
      "And it will be irreparably damaged if Ratcliffe, his executives and the Glazers do not get the football appointments right at the end of this season. First of all, it would be helpful if United secure a Champions League spot for next season.",
      "The area in which United were financially trounced in 2024/25 was broadcast revenue. Liverpool, City and Arsenal all brought in at least £100million more than United’s £180million. The 2025/26 figures will not be any better for United.",
      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe and his advisers made an expensive mistake when hiring Ruben Amorim(Image: Michael Regan - UEFA/UEFA via Getty Images)",
      "Quite simply, they need to be re-established as a club that does not miss a Champions League season, let alone a European season in any form, as it did for 2025/26. If Ratcliffe and his people think Michael Carrick is the man that can ensure that, then fine.",
      "But what Ratcliffe and the Glazers then need to do is give him - or whoever they decide should manage the team next season - muscular financial backing. Look, you don’t win a big pot for coming top of the Deloitte’s Football Money League.",
      "There is no open-top bus parade for being revenue champions of Europe. But this is another stark reminder that, having made a costly mistake with Ruben Amorim, Sir Jim and his people cannot afford to keep messing up the football business.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Bruno Fernandes could help Manchester United sign Ruben Neves.(Image: Carl Recine/Getty Images)",
      "Manchester United captain Bruno Fernandes could, potentially, play a key part in the Red Devils' potential signing of former Wolves midfielder Ruben Neves. The 28-year-old is currently plying his trade in Saudi Arabia after joining Al-Hilal in the summer of 2023.",
      "Nevertheless, with Neves' contract set to expire this summer, he's understood to have attracted suitors willing to facilitate his return to Europe before the conclusion of the 2025/2026 campaign.",
      "Consequently, Al-Hilal are reportedly accepting of losing the Portugal international, with £18million believed to be sufficient to secure his signature in January. United are among those being linked - with the Reds looking to bolster their midfield options - especially with Casemiro on his way.",
      "Fernandes revealed to The Standard, in December, that he had been in touch with Neves after he was connected to Al Hilal during the summer. He said: \"The person who spoke to me was the president of Al-Hilal - who called me directly.",
      "\"Ruben Neves sent me a message saying he wanted to talk to me. They wanted me to play in the Club World Cup with Al-Hilal.\"",
      "\"It was already a love that came from the Jorge Jesus era. He had already called me in 2023.\"",
      "Ruben Neves has been linked with a transfer to Man Utd.(Image: (Photo by Jose Manuel Alvarez Rey/Getty Images))",
      "In a further possible boost to United, meanwhile, Real Madrid are \"not interested\" in signing Neves this month. According to reports in Spain - as per Sport Witness - the Los Blancos' president Florentino Perez isn't keen on signing new players in January.",
      "Speaking with Portuguese broadcaster Sport TV last August, Neves opened up about his ambition to re-join his boyhood side, FC Porto. \"I've said it in all the interviews - it's not coming back to finish your career, it's going back to play and be competitive; that's my big goal,\" he said.",
      "\"Fortunately, I'm 28-years-old and I feel very good physically. This is a career goal, because I wasn't champion at Porto and having a family of over 60 people who support the club - it's something that I want to give them and experience [for myself].",
      "\"I used to go to the Aliados to celebrate Porto's titles.",
      "\"But now I want to be on the other side and want to see my family celebrate.\"",

      "Michael Carrick has yet to add to his Manchester United squad in January(Image: Getty Images)",
      "There might not be a permanent manager in the Manchester United dugout but that doesn't mean the transfer chatter around the Red Devils has died down. Whether it's this month under interim boss Michael Carrick or - perhaps more likely - when a permanent appointment is made in the summer, the squad could well get a proper refresh.",
      "It has been a quiet window so far, with the exception of Carrick stepping in after Ruben Amorim's dismissal. There have been no new additions on the playing side but there has been one exit, with young winger Sam Mather joining Turkish side Kayserispor.",
      "On the pitch, United are gearing up to take on Premier League leaders Arsenal on Sunday. They also face Fulham at Old Trafford on February 1, just one day before the winter transfer window slams shut.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UTD FB PAGE! Latest United news and more on our dedicated Facebook page",
      "On Wednesday, reports emerged that Cole Palmer was homesick at Chelsea and The Express suggested he would be a perfect fit for Manchester United. While it remains to be seen whether United and Chelsea would be able to thrash out a summer deal, former Blues star Marcel Desailly has urged the England international to leave Stamford Bridge - just not yet.",
      "\"I believe Palmer wants more stability and a system that’s built for him, but he still needs to fully recover from his groin injury and get back to full fitness,\" Desailly told Card Player. \"His recent performances speak for themselves, so he needs to stay humble and come back into the team to help the club, regardless of whether he stays or goes.",
      "Cole Palmer in action for Chelsea(Image: CameraSport via Getty Images)",
      "\"The question is whether he feel like Chelsea are going to win the Premier League in the next two seasons. If he doesn’t, I’m sure he will ask for a transfer request to a club that will build a system around him. For now, however, he needs to hit his previous levels for Chelsea to help them and their new manager through this period.\"",
      "Roma will test Manchester United's resolve with a concrete bid for Joshua Zirkzee, according to Sky in Italy. The publication reports that the Giallorossi had been waiting for United to get Bryan Mbeumo back from the Africa Cup of Nations before returning to the negotiating table.",
      "Joshua Zirkzee continues to be linked with a January move(Image: Getty Images)",
      "Zirkzee is reported to be keen to fight for his place at Old Trafford but Roma are ready to pounce if he changes his mind. The Dutch international missed the weekend win over Manchester City with a minor injury but has struggled for regular minutes this season on the whole.",
      "He still has a high reputation in Italy thanks to his form helping Bologna qualify for the Champions League in 2024. His performances under Thiago Motta prompted United to splash the cash but Zirzkee has been unable to consistently hit top gear since scoring a winner against Fulham on his debut.",
      "Juventus were also linked with the forward when Motta was their manager but those links have died down. Roma's preference, it is claimed, is for a loan with a conditional option to buy in the summer.",

      "Victoria Beckham has been accused of \"inappropriate\" behaviour by her son Brooklyn(Image: Getty Images for Reebok)",
      "Victoria Beckham is no stranger to raising a few eyebrows. Amid fresh accusations from her son Brooklyn Beckham about her behaviour behind closed doors, an old anecdote has resurfaced that paints a very different, if still surprising, picture of the former Spice Girl.",
      "The fashion designer has been thrust under the microscope this week following Brooklyn's explosive Instagram post. On Monday, the 26-year-old - the oldest child of Victoria and Sir David Beckham - blasted his parents in a savage statement. He claimed he'd been \"controlled\" by them and accused the pair of trying to \"ruin\" his relationship with his wife Nicola Peltz Beckham.",
      "He levelled particularly stinging accusations at his mother, asserting that she \"cancelled\" making Nicola's wedding dress at the last minute. He also claimed that she called him \"evil\" and \"hijacked\" his first dance with Nicola, before dancing \"very inappropriately\".",
      "While these claims remain unverified, they have prompted renewed scrutiny of Victoria's conduct at family events - and they are not the first stories to leave people surprised by her behaviour at a celebration involving one of her sons.",
      "Back in 2007, shortly after Sir David's high-profile move to LA Galaxy, the Beckhams hosted a birthday party for one of their children, inviting the club's players and their families. Years later, Carlos Pavon Jr - son of former Galaxy striker Carlos Pavon - recalled that Victoria stole the show at the party, not just among the adults, but with the kids as well.",
      "\"I was playing with [Beckham's] son on the inflatable trampoline and we were jumping, and then out of nowhere, I notice the kid's mum comes in, David's wife, Victoria,\" Pavon Jr told the La Pelota Al DIEZ podcast.",
      "\"She started jumping with us and I was like, 'I can't believe I'm doing this with Victoria Beckham,' so I think that was the funniest thing. Everybody saw when she came in and started jumping with us, so when I came out, I think they all saw my surprised face, like, 'Wow, that just happened.' It was really funny.\"",
      "Tensions within the Beckham family have reportedly been simmering for years. Brooklyn's relationship with Nicola began in 2019, with the pair getting engaged in 2020 before eventually tying the knot in 2022. While relations were said to be warm at first, cracks began to emerge in the lead-up to the wedding.",
      "Victoria Beckham delighted guests by bouncing on the bouncy castle at her son's birthday party shortly after David's move to LA Galaxy(Image: Ted Soqui/Corbis via Getty Images)",
      "A major source of friction is believed to centre on the controversy surrounding Nicola's wedding dress. It's understood that she had initially planned to wear a gown designed by Victoria's fashion label but ultimately walked down the aisle in a custom Valentino creation instead.",
      "According to Brooklyn, the change was not by choice. He alleges that Victoria \"cancelled making Nicola's dress in the eleventh hour... forcing her to urgently find a new dress.\" He has also claimed that on the night before the wedding, family members told him Nicola was \"not blood\" and \"not family.\"",
      "Brooklyn also claimed that Victoria called him \"evil\" during planning because he chose to seat his and Nicola's grandmothers at the top table rather than prioritising his parents.",
      "Rumours of a rift began circulating - and while attempts to quash those rumours with several joint public appearances together helped, things escalated in 2025 when Brooklyn and Nicola decided not to attend David's 50th birthday party. Months later, David and Victoria were notably absent from Brooklyn and Nicola's vow renewal ceremony, signalling a deep divide.",
      "Tensions in the Beckham family have been simmering for years(Image: Samir Hussein/WireImage)",
      "In December last year, reports surfaced that Brooklyn had blocked both his parents and siblings on social media. A few weeks later, he reportedly sent a legal letter to his parents demanding all future communication go through his lawyers.",
      "\"I have been silent for years and made every effort to keep these matters private,\" Brooklyn said on Monday. \"Unfortunately my parents and their team have continued to go to the press, leaving me with no choice but to speak for myself and tell the truth about only some of the lies that have been printed.",
      "\"I do not want to reconcile with my family. I'm not being controlled, I'm standing up for myself for the first time in my life. For my entire life, my parents have controlled narratives in the press about our family.",
      "\"The performative social media posts, family events and inauthentic relationships have been a fixture of the life I was born into.\"",
      "He added: \"My parents have been trying endlessly to ruin my relationship since before my wedding, and it hasn't stopped... My wife has been consistently disrespected by my family, no matter how hard we've tried to come together as one. My mum has repeatedly invited women from my past into our lives in ways that were clearly intended to make us both uncomfortable.\"",
      "Brooklyn (R) slammed his parents in an explosive statement on social media this week(Image: Getty)",
      "He ended by saying: \"My wife has been consistently disrespected by my family, no matter how hard we've tried to come together as one. My mum has repeatedly invited women from my past into our lives in ways that were clearly intended to make us both uncomfortable.\"",
      "On Tuesday, Sir David broke his silence on the controversy. The former England and Manchester United footballer acknowledged that his children had \"made mistakes\" on social media, while stressing that they are \"allowed\" to do so - insisting it is part of how they learn.",
      "\"What kids can access these days, it can be dangerous. But what I have found personally, especially with my kids as well, use it for the right reasons,\" he told CNBC. \"I've been able to use my platform for my following, for UNICEF. And it has been the biggest tool to make people aware of what’s going on around the world for children.",
      "\"And I have tried to do the same with my children, to educate them. They make mistakes, but children are allowed to make mistakes. That is how they learn. That is what I try to teach my kids.\"",

With United expected to appoint a permanent boss in the summer, the club's long-term strategy regarding transfers - both in terms of arrivals and departures - remains unclear.",
      "Despite this uncertainty, former United forward Giuseppe Rossi believes Carrick should pursue a deal to bring Napoli's McTominay back to Old Trafford in a sensational return, more than a year after his £25million switch to the Italian club.",
      "Speaking to OLBG, the former Italy international suggested Carrick's caretaker role gives him the chance to lure McTominay back to his boyhood club. He said: \"Bring back Scott McTominay! You can't get a player now and then change for a different player in the summer.",

      "United made the decision a while ago that the 33-year-old’s contract wouldn’t be renewed or extended and informed Casemiro that was the situation.",
      "But with speculation over his future hitting overdrive in recent weeks, he asked the club to make their plans public in order to \"bring external clarity\" to the situation, according to a source. Casemiro was keen to avoid incorrect speculation that the club would offer a new contract or trigger an option.",
      "That has become an issue in recent days, with the player holding a clause in his contract that extends his deal by a year if he starts 35 games this season. To hit that clause, he would need to start every remaining fixture, but that won't be happening.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FACEBOOK PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "By making his exit public five months before his contract expires at the end of June, it offers Casemiro and his team time to prepare for next season and plot his move for the 2026/27 campaign, although his focus will remain on United. He was outstanding in Saturday's derby day win against Manchester City.",
      "The decision not to offer the experienced midfielder a new deal is part of United's plans to overhaul the squad. Casemiro was signed for an initial £60million from Real Madrid in the summer of 2022, with add-ons taking that fee to £70million.

      "We have answered your questions on Manchester United this week(Image: )",
      "It's been a good week at Old Trafford and a relatively quiet one as well, for a change. Victory against Manchester City was the perfect start to the Michael Carrick era and it has calmed things down.",
      "Carrick was handed a contract until the end of the season at Manchester United but got his 17-game stint in charge off to the perfect start as goals from Bryan Mbeumo and Patrick Dorgu secured a thoroughly deserved 2-0 win.",
      "United now travel to Arsenal on Sunday when they will be looking to make another statement, while the transfer window also remains open. We'll be running through a few questions related to that in this week's Q&A.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FACEBOOK PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "We run weekly question and answer sessions, so click here to submit your questions, and we'll answer them next week. Here are the answers to some of this week's questions:",
      "When are we signing a better right-back?",
      "A LOT of questions this week about Diogo Dalot. It's pretty clear Dalot has become the whipping boy this season and there was a sense of frustration again when he sent an early pass straight out of play on Saturday. In fairness, I thought he recovered well and had a decent game.",
      "Signing a right-back has been a long-running saga at Old Trafford and it could get overtaken again this summer, when midfield will clearly take up a huge portion of the war chest.",
      "Dalot has had a difficult season, and part of the current issue is that if he has a drop in form, there isn't a great deal of competition. Noussair Mazraoui is back now and could offer some before the end of the season now that he isn't needed in the back three.",
      "If United qualify for the Champions League, then they might be able to get a transfer kitty that can include a right-back as well, but the priority will certainly be midfield signings. Speaking of which...",
      "Are United going to address the obvious midfield problems this month? Rumours about Ruben Neves, would be an astute signing at £15m to £20m.",
      "I wouldn't be at all surprised if this window closed without a midfielder being signed. It feels less of an issue than it did at the start of the month. The return to a 4-2-3-1 system has taken the pressure off in terms of numbers, as has Carrick's trust in Kobbie Mainoo.",
      "Casemiro and Mainoo started against City and I imagine they will against Arsenal. Manuel Ugarte and Mason Mount are both on the bench. In the No. 10 role, Bruno Fernandes is starting and Mount and Matheus Cunha offer alternatives. Fernandes could always drop deeper as well.",
      "I don't think there is a desperate issue there with numbers and there are only 15 games to go after this weekend. There has been a lot of agent talk around Neves but nothing concrete. Players like Wilfred Ndidi have been offered, but at that level, there is no improvement to the squad.",
      "United want to keep their power dry for the summer, and at the moment, I think that is what is most likely to happen. But expect at least two new midfielders this summer and significant investment in that area of the pitch.",
      "Will the club do what they did with Solskjaer and rush in to appointing Carrick?",
      "In short, no. Carrick made an excellent start but he has to continue that now. If he wins the next 16 games then clearly he will get the job and he is at least in a position to have an audition.",
      "United insist the process will be thorough, and right now, I'd still consider Carrick an outsider. That could change, though. If performances continue to match Saturday's and he shows he can improve players, then his candidacy becomes more attractive.",
      "As of now, it feels like a wide-open market to see who comes next.",
      "Why aren't ALL of the owners looking to sell the club after the worst two years of running the club, in the club's history?",
      "I can see this being a big topic again leading into the Fulham game and a planned protest against the Glazers and Ineos. It feels like the mood has shifted significantly in recent weeks in terms of Sir Jim Ratcliffe. He was facing criticism before but it has become more widespread now.",
      "It will be interesting to see the size of the protest - The 1958 expect it to be the biggest yet - and where much of the anger is directed. The union between the Glazers and the Ratcliffe regime feels like a problem in terms of getting things done.",
      "But at the moment, I don't see any scenario developing where there is a sale of part or even all of the club.",

United are a club credited with interest in several players, and a central midfielder appears to be at the top of their shortlist, according to the rumour mill.",

      "Martinez will definitely be one to watch for Man United. Lammens has done well since coming in, I think he's looked solid and reliable, but they could do with a real top-class goalkeeper in there. Martinez certainly fits that bill. I think he's still one of the best in the world when he's at the top of his game, and he would certainly be an improvement.",
      "So if Villa are going to be willing to let him go, then they'd be silly not to consider it at least. They wanted him in the summer, and nothing has changed since then. If he's available and the price isn't too much for them to afford, I would be surprised if they didn't make a move.",

Casemiro was keen to avoid incorrect speculation that the club would offer a new contract or trigger an option.",

Both of them should have been offloaded a long time ago, but they are still here collecting their paycheques,” Parker said in an interview with MyBettingSites.",
      "“The fact that they are still here is a joke. Are they the worst players in the team? No, but they have been here for so long, taking up space in the squad and performing below what you expect from a Manchester United player.",
      "“Has it been impossible to get rid of them? It is definitely a possibility that they just like being part of Manchester United and earning a lot of money, but that tells me a lot about their ambitions.",
      "“If they had real ambition, they would move on to a club where they could make a difference. They can play at Manchester United, but they can’t make a difference.”",
      "Man United have reportedly registered an interest in West Ham's Mateus Fernandes, according to SportsBoom.",

      "Reports in Spain have claimed that Man United have launched a bid for Real Madrid star Federico Valverde.",
      "E-Noticies claim a club-record £104m bid has been put on the table and Valverde would be keen on the move. However, it's clear the move would only be feasible in the summer.",

      "But in response to the interest, it's said that Tottenham have placed a stunning £100million price tag on Van de Ven's head.",
      "Reports this week from ESPN, suggest United are set to open talks with Fernandes over a new deal before the World Cup. In October, the captain seemed determined to stay at Old Trafford for as long as possible. Two months later, that position was thrown into doubt when in an interview back in Portugal, he suggested he did not feel wanted and outlined a number of opportunities he would like to pursue before retiring.",
      "Amorim said Fernandes had informed the club about the interview and things were smoothed over. However, last summer when the captain was weighing up a move to the Saudi Pro League, Fernandes explained it was Amorim who convinced him to stay. With the Portuguese head coach no longer at the club, it will be interesting to see how these talks transpire.",
      "According to TEAMTalk, Manchester United are expected to intensify their interest in Nottingham Forest midfielder Elliot Anderson IF they miss out on Adam Wharton to Liverpool or Tottenham.",
      "United are expected to rival Manchester City for Anderson, who has been excellent since joining Forest from Newcastle in 2024. He is even set to be England's starting No.6 for the World Cup in the summer.",
      "Sheffield Wednesday spoke highly of United in the summer after they agreed to waive a fee to allow Harry Amass to join the Championship club on loan. This was due to the Owls' poor financial position under previous owner Dejphon Chansiri.",
      "Wednesday had hoped they could extend Amass' stay until the end of the campaign and their manager Henrik Pedersen was confident a deal could be done before last week's fixtures.",
      "However, the full-back is set to join Norwich City on loan for the remainder of the campaign which will be a blow for Wednesday. For United, the move to the Canaries makes more sense, particularly as Norwich will be involved in more competitive fixtures than the Owls between now and the end of the campaign.",

      "Aston Villa have expressed interest in Ruben Loftus-Cheek just days after he was reportedly 'offered' to United. The ex-Chelsea academy graduate has slipped down the hierarchy at AC Milan and could be loaned out as he aims to secure a place in the World Cup squad.",
      "Villa are seeking reinforcements following an injury to Boubacar Kamara, who is expected to miss the remainder of the season. According to The Athletic, Unai Emery's team could look to secure a midfielder on loan, with Loftus-Cheek among the candidates being considered.",
      "The Midlands club have already been unsuccessful in their pursuit of Conor Gallagher this month, with Tottenham presenting a permanent offer to Atletico Madrid. Loftus-Cheek was previously reported to have been proposed to United, and 'exploratory' discussions are said to have occurred.",
      "Manchester United is considered as a 'potential destination' for Borussia Dortmund forward Felix Nmecha, according to Sport Bild. The 25-year-old hasn't kicked on as much as he would have hoped at Dortmund and has scored just five goals in 28 appearances this season.",
      "Despite this, Dortmund have no interest in letting the player leave the club before the end of the transfer window. Nmecha has two-and-a-half years left on his contract at the Bundesliga club.",
      "As things stand, United are sticking to their guns when it comes to bringing in players before the February 2 deadline.",
      "It was the case before Amorim was sacked and it is the case now Carrick is in interim charge, that there is a reluctance to sign players in January as the long-term plan is to invest in the summer.",
      "However, United were willing to go back on that stance had they won the race for Semenyo. The money was there for the Ghana international but in the end he chose City.",
      "Since then the money has been locked away but should a long-term target become available for the right price, United could open their cheque book again.",
      "Manchester United influential fan group The 1958 are planning their biggest-ever protest against the club's owners - and the first one directed at Sir Jim Ratcliffe - for the Premier League game against Fulham on Sunday, February 1.",
      "The group have urged supporters to gather at two meeting points ahead of the game at Old Trafford, with organising expecting well over the 6,000 that attended the peaceful protest against Arsenal last May.",
      "\"Jim Ratcliffe chose to get into bed with the Glazers and, in our opinion, is helping to keep them in charge. Twenty-one years of a debt mountain, mismanagement and financial greed is 21 years too long. Enough is enough,\" a The 1958 spokesperson said in a statement.",
      "\"So we protest not just against the Glazers, but now also against INEOS and Ratcliffe, a man once seen by many, including ourselves, as a possible saviour, a beacon of hope, but now revealed as complicit in the ongoing erosion of everything that makes our club what it is.",
      "\"This is no longer just about ownership; this is about survival. The survival of our identity, the survival of our fan culture, our supporter community, and our values.\"",
      "According to TEAMTalk, Manchester United are exploring the loan market for a new midfielder and Wilfred Ndidi is thought to be under consideration. The former Leicester man has made 16 appearances since making the move to Besiktas last summer.",
      "The 29-year-old had been touted as a free agent target for United at the end of last season, but he instead moved abroad after his contract expired at Leicester and opted to sign for Besiktas instead.",
      "But now, United are still tracking Ndidi's progress and could move into the loan market for the one-time FA Cup winner, who has two-and-a-half years left on his current deal."

      "Manchester United interim head coach Michael Carrick will be back in front of the media this afternoon with plenty to discuss ahead of Sunday's trip to Arsenal in the Premier League.",
      "On Thursday evening, the Reds announced midfielder Casemiro would be leaving Old Trafford at the end of the season. The 33-year-old's contract will expire at the end of this campaign and while United do have a clause to extend his stay by a further 12 months, it will not be activated.",
      "Carrick will likely be asked about the Brazilian as well as previewing the visit to the Emirates Stadium this weekend. United are set to be without Matthijs de Ligt and Joshua Zirkzee for the game as both men missed the derby and were not captured in training footage on Wednesday.",
      "Noussair Mazraoui suffered disappointment with Morocco in the Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) final last weekend and was granted additional time off to recover. The defender was expected to return to Carrington before the end of the week and could be in the squad which travels to Arsenal.",
      "Follow the updates from Carrick's press conference below...",
      "I thought he played ever so well last week. There was the incident with the yellow card but to manage that and defend as he did was good. It has been ups and downs with performance. Diogo is really focused, loves playing for the club and did fantastic.",
      "It is a variety in terms of strengths. I gave him a free role to drift. Ben is great on the line. Josh can do a bit of he is very good at bringing players into it. It is great to have that flexibility in terms of carrying the game to the later stages.",
      "We have got our ideas on how to get there. They are in a really strong place. Mikel takes credit for that. We have our own ideas that is what we are working towards.",
      "I really enjoyed working with Kobbie. This club needs young players coming through and laying the foundation. It is something we need to grasp and build on. To come through so quickly shows an awful lot of quality in terms of his character. A career has ups and downs but we saw last week what he can bring. He was enjoying himself.",
      "They are a very good team. It is a big challenge. They are in the Champions League for a reason. Not taking them lightly. We want to be positive.",
      "Hopefully he had a setback befvore I arrived, only small. It was slower than we thought. He will hopefully be back in the next few weeks.",
      "For the week or so I have not looked too far down the track. Every decision I make is not short term. I have a responsibility to leave the club in a good place. As time goes on, I am sure I will be part of it",
      "It is coming into that time of the season with contracts. We are working away through January. There will be conversations at the right time. The announcement for Case was for clarity. It was decided before I arrived. The type of personality and character he is shows with his performance. He is desperate to do well.",
      "I will not tell you the team. Everyone came through really well. It has been a good week. A big result, performance and an uplift inside the stadium. We need to keep our feet on the ground. One game does not make you a great team. A lot of confidence.",
      "Carrick is here and the press conference shortly...",
      "We are just ten minutes away from Carrick ahead of the trip to Arsenal this weekend!",
      "Amorim insisted on doing everything his way at Manchester United, which meant he ignored some easy wins, like making the effort to attend an academy game to show support for the club's young players. Amorim once walked over to observe some of an academy match at Carrington, but he did not make the effort to properly watch a youth game during his one-and-a-half-year tenure. Michael Carrick was appointed as interim last week and attended an Under-21 match just seven days later, sitting alongside Steve Holland, Jonathan Woodgate and Travis Binnion. Jason Wilcox, director of football, and head of the academy, Stephen Torpey, were present, while Darren Fletcher also attended after returning to his role as Under-18 following a brief stint as caretaker.",
      "It might not seem important that Carrick and his backroom staff made the effort to attend, but the truth is their presence is a symbol of support for the youth system and highlights that there is a pathway. Carrick planned to speak to the Under-21s after their game against Sporting Lisbon, another classy touch from United's interim head coach. Some academy players were disillusioned with Amorim's comments in the media, but Carrick has sought to provide encouragement in his first week in the job.",

      "Here are the topics we expect Carrick to be asked about this afternoon at Carrington",
      "We are just one hour away from Carrick's press conference. There should be plenty on the agenda for United's interim head coach to discuss today ahead of the trip to the Emirates Stadium.",
      "Last weekend's victory over City was a big statement of intent for the Reds as they remain firmly in the hunt for a top-four spot this season to guarantee Champions League football. Fifth could also be enough for United again this season but the club won't want to rely on that.",
      "Race for the top-four",
      "4) Liverpool - 36pts and +4 GD",
      "5) Manchester United - 35pts and +6 GD",
      "6) Chelsea - 34pts and +12 GD",
      "7) Brentford - 33pts and +5 GD",
      "8) Newcastle United - 33pts and +5 GD",
      "9) Sunderland - 33pts and 0 GD",
      "After a busy January which has already seen Amorim leave, Carrick return and Casemiro announce his impending departure, is there more twists and turns to come before deadline day on February 2. Our United writer Tyrone Marshall has shared his thoughts in the latest Q&A.",
      "Read more here>>>",
      "United have confirmed Casemiro will leave the club when his contract expires this summer after a request from the Brazilian international. United made the decision a while ago that the 33-year-old’s contract wouldn’t be renewed or extended and informed Casemiro that was the situation.",
      "But with speculation over his future hitting overdrive in recent weeks, he asked the club to make their plans public in order to \"bring external clarity\" to the situation, according to a source. Casemiro was keen to avoid incorrect speculation that the club would offer a new contract or trigger an option.",
      "Read more here>>>",
      "After announcing he would be leaving at the end of the season, Casemiro said:",
      "I will carry Manchester United with me throughout my entire life. From the first day that I walked out at this beautiful stadium, I felt the passion of Old Trafford and the love that I now share with our supporters for this special club. It is not time to say goodbye; there are many more memories to create during the next four months. We still have a lot to fight for together; my complete focus will, as always, remain on giving my everything to help our club to succeed.",

      "The United interim head coach is expected to speak to the media at around 1pm this afternoon with an embargo set until 1.30pm. Once the embargo lifts, we shall be able to bring you everything United's interim head coach has to say.",
      "Good morning and welcome to the United press conference blog as Michael Carrick prepares to address the media before the trip to Arsenal on Sunday. Carrick may have been preparing himself for questions on Casemiro's future this afternoon but after United's statement on Thursday evening, the response should be easier for him. The midfielder will leave the club at the end of this season and United will be needing to replace him in the summer transfer window. Speaking of transfer windows, Carrick could also be asked about potential midfield incomings this month now we know Casemiro will leave the club. United's stance has been to leave spending for the summer but it remains to be seen if this stance will change following the midfielder's confirmed departure.",
      "We shall also be hearing the latest team news from the United camp and Carrick's thoughts on Arsenal later too.",
      "Stay tuned for updates..."

      "Casemiro is leaving Manchester United this summer(Image: PA)",
      "Manchester United’s announcement that Casemiro will leave Old Trafford at the end of the season is a clear sign that the club are focused on the summer transfer window.",
      "It was revealed this week that the Brazilian veteran, 33, will leave this summer at the end of his contract after four seasons with the club. United opted not to renew the five-time Champions League winner’s staggering £350,000-a-week contract, having signed him in August 2022 when Erik ten Hag was in charge.",
      "Casemiro has played 146 games and scored 21 goals for United to date, with Michael Carrick’s eventual managerial successor losing an experienced voice in the dressing room. Yet, his departure will provide an opportunity for a much-needed midfield rebuild given the space it frees up on United’s wage bill.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FB PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "United chiefs were widely reported to be prioritising midfield signings this summer even before Casemiro’s announcement. Sources suggest they will not be active in January, meaning they will have between £100-150million to spend come May, which could rise if they decide to cash in on Bruno Fernandes, who was the subject of a £100m bid from Saudi Arabia last summer.",
      "At the base of midfield, there are two options to succeed Casemiro in Wharton, 21, and Baleba, 22. Brighton’s Baleba was a well-known target for United last summer. The club explored the conditions of a deal but the move didn’t materialise.",
      "Another top target is Crystal Palace’s Wharton, who could become the latest player to want to jump ship from the south London club, who are aware of the England international's desire to play Champions League football.",
      "Elliot Anderson [L] and Adam Wharton [R] would be two top signings for United(Image: 2025 the FA)",
      "With Wharton costing upwards of £60m and more than £100m being required to convince Brighton to sell Baleba, the former appears to be the more shrewd choice, especially given Baleba’s disappointing season so far. The physically imposing Cameroonian would be more of a like-for-like replacement for Casemiro but Wharton’s Carrick-like presence in midfield would mark an evolution in the position for United.",
      "The question of who would partner Wharton is trickier given United already have academy graduate Kobbie Mainoo at their disposal. Yet, there is one standout player whose performances this season indicate the club must sign him at all cost - Nottingham Forest’s Anderson.",
      "Forest have no intention of selling the England international, 23, and competition from Premier League rivals would certainly drive up Anderson’s price, which is being reported as around £75m-£100m. But the all-action midfielder would be worth every penny as a statement signing and one who would instantly elevate the side.",
      "Should that deal fall through, however, Wolves’ Gomes - valued at £35m-45m - would be an excellent back-up. The Reds have been tracking the Wolves star since the summer as they look to improve their engine room.",
      "That leaves the attacking-midfield position left vacant by Fernandes’ hypothetical exit. Matheus Cunha would be the favourite out of the current crop to take on the role as chief creator, though Chelsea’s Cole Palmer has recently been named as an audacious potential signing.",
      "Cole Palmer is reportedly homesick(Image: Photo by Darren Walsh/Chelsea FC via Getty Images)",
      "United fan and former Manchester City player Palmer has become one of the best players in the league since his move to Chelsea in 2023 but The Sun claim the playmaker is ‘homesick’ in London and could be interested in moving close to his home, Manchester.",
      "That certainly plays into United’s hands, with Palmer’s wages also not believed to be an issue. However, the 23-year-old could cost a Premier League record fee close to the £150m mark, making his signing unrealistic.",
      "Instead, Cunha would likely step into Fernandes’ shoes in the case of his departure, with United able to sign Gomes from Wolves as a third midfield reinforcement. That could leave United’s midfield looking like this at the start of the 2026/27 season:",
      "Starters: Adam Wharton, Elliot Anderson, Matheus Cunha.",
      "Depth options: Manuel Ugarte, Kobbie Mainoo, Mason Mount, Joao Gomes.",

      "Malacia was placed in the 'bomb squad' in the summer and made available for transfer, only to remain at the club for the first half of the season with no deal struck.",
      "The 26-year-old was reintegrated into the first-team squad in October and has made the bench for 13 of the last 15 games in all competitions, but he has been used only once when coming on as an 88th-minute substitute against Newcastle on Boxing Day.",
      "It's been a frustrating year for the Netherlands international, who joined PSV Eindhoven on loan for the second half of last season but returned to his parent club after making 12 appearances, with just six starts.",
      "There has been interest in Malacia from clubs in Italy, Spain and Turkey this month, but it is understood there is no move imminent. The former Feyenoord defender has just five months remaining on his United contract and will be released at the end of the season if a deal isn't done this month, although he is keen to get more games under his belt.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FB PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "He was the only one of five players placed in Amorim's infamous 'bomb squad' who didn't end up leaving Old Trafford in the summer. Antony, Alejandro Garnacho, Jadon Sancho and Marcus Rashford all secured moves away, either permanently or on loan.",
      "Malacia played 45 minutes for United's Under-21s against Wolves earlier this month, scoring in a 4-1 win. He has proven his fitness since missing 517 days with two serious knee injuries.",
      "He made his comeback in an EFL Trophy game against Huddersfield in November 2024 and went on to make eight further appearances for United before his move to PSV last January.",
      "Malacia's place in the matchday squad could be in jeopardy, with Noussair Mazraoui set to return from Africa Cup of Nations duty with Morocco before Sunday's trip to Arsenal. Mazraoui offers full-back cover on the left and right, while Luke Shaw is the first-choice at left-back in Michael Carrick's back four.",
      "Patrick Dorgu can also play at left-back, although he played on the wing in the win against Manchester City last weekend. United also have the highly rated 18-year-old Diego Leon in their ranks.",

      "The Brazilian's departure in four months' time is one way in which the club are seeking to remodel their squad, and getting the wages of a star player off the books will help them do that. Casemiro arrived from Real Madrid in 2022 in a deal rising to as much as £70m, scoring 21 times in his 146 games so far from the base of United's midfield.",
      "After helping the squad to a League Cup and FA Cup win, there had been calls to sell the ageing midfielder, but this season has shown that he is still more than capable of being a key man, most recently at the derby win over Manchester City. Posting on his Instagram account, Casemiro said: \"Knowing when stages come to an end. Knowing when to say goodbye when you feel that you will be remembered and respected forever.",
      "\"Four months to give my all for this badge and for our goal. Eternal respect and affection for Manchester United and its wonderful fans. Forever Red Devil.\"",
      "Some fans were quick to give Casemiro his flowers for his stint at the club. Reader Heehee123 says: \"Scored 21 goals and a quite a few of those were very important. Can hold his head high, at least he was one player who always gave his all.\"",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FB PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "Commenter Antw writes: \"People underestimate how good Casemiro actually is. He’s had a few off games, but when we played Lyon at Old Trafford & miraculously won, Casemiro had a part to play in all of the last 3 goals. He won the penalty, he set up Mainoo & also set up Maguire. Unfortunately his legs are giving up.\"",
      "Chrisssssss says: \"Yeah sad to see him go, but realistically seems like a sensible decision. Always more humble than I imagined.\"",
      "Phillotommo writes: \"Sad to See him go. But the legs have gone. Some great memories, and the passion he has for United is infectious. Pity his teammates haven't got the same work ethic as him. Best of Luck Cas, C'MON UNITED.\"",
      "For others, thoughts are already turning to what comes next for United's midfield. 1968red says: \"Well at least it will free up a few quid for a replacement, but it's been money well spent since we signed him. Wish him all the best and thanks for the memories Cas.\"",
      "Rightwing7 wants to see a similar character come in through the door: \"One of the best, if not the best DM in football history. Unfortunately for us, we got only 30% of the best Casemiro, but he give us 100% of what was left in his tank. Never complaining, 100% professional. Wish we can get a young 'Case', like the one when he was in his prime. All my respect for a fantastic football player, and I wish him well in future.\"",
      "Some would even like to see him remain at United in a different capacity. On our Facebook page, Ng Yoon Fatt says: \"This guy is a fantastic professional. He could be an inspiration to our kids in the academy. Personally, I would want to keep him, of course at the right price.\"",
      "Peter Bowker agrees: \"He should be put on the coaching staff in the academy. He is like Cantona, he commands respect. Been a great football player.\"",

      "Marcus Rashford's future remains a source of intrigue(Image: Getty Images)",
      "There are continued question marks over Marcus Rashford's future following the change of manager at Manchester United.",
      "Rashford's Red Devils career looked dead and buried following his fallout with Ruben Amorim, which led to him being frozen out of the first-team squad and sent on loan to Aston Villa and then Barcelona.",
      "However, the sacking of Amorim has potentially altered the landscape. Michael Carrick, who has played with and coached Rashford in the past, will be looking to do enough to land the job on a permanent basis in the summer.",
      "As it stands, United look more likely to try and secure a top-tier coach to lead the side into next season. But where does that leave Rashford? MEN Sport looks at the potential options for the England forward…",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FACEBOOK PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "United are still believed to be keen on cashing in on Rashford, whose Barca loan deal comes with an option to buy for around £26million.",
      "Barca boss Hansi Flick recently praised Rashford's \"really good\" performances this season but insisted no decision had been taken on buying the player outright. Other clubs will undoubtedly be sniffing around, though staying with Barcelona would be his preference.",
      "Given the 28-year-old's contract expires in 2028, that £26m fee would realistically decrease going forward, making the next window a prime time to bank as much as possible for him - particularly given his homegrown status when it comes to PSR.",
      "Rashford has impressed at Barcelona(Image: Getty Images)",
      "United have been credited with an interest in Barcelona midfielder Marc Casado, who is said to be open to a move to the Premier League. With Casemiro's summer exit confirmed, and Manuel Ugarte also linked with a departure, the position is very much top of the transfer priority list.",
      "That raises the possibility of a potential swap deal involving Rashford. With both players carrying similar valuations, a deal could potentially be thrashed out in the summer.",
      "However, that would hinge on Casado still being a Barca player at the end of the season. The 22-year-old is on the radar of Atletico Madrid, who are in the market for a midfielder after selling Conor Gallagher to Tottenham.",
      "Marc Casado has been linked with United(Image: Icon Sport via Getty Images)",
      "This would be kicking the can down the road somewhat but cannot be ruled out and could make more financial sense for Barca. Another season-long loan could be agreed with an obligation to buy in the summer of 2027.",
      "The sticking point in that scenario would be exactly how much that sum amounts to. Given the £26m figure has already been set, going much lower than that would make little sense from United's perspective.",
      "On the flip side, it does once again get his hefty £325k-a-week wages off the books for another year, freeing up space for some crucial summer signings.",
      "Despite Amorim's departure, this still seems the least likely scenario. Rashford has made it clear he is happy at Barcelona, while a clean break with United may be best for both parties.",
      "However, a return cannot be ruled out entirely following the change of manager. The next permanent boss, be it Carrick or someone else, may seek to reintegrate the forward.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "The summer transfer mission for Manchester United is clear: it's time to sign a midfielder.",
      "The club have been putting off their next big investment in the central ranks for some time now, having put their focus into improving other areas such as the backline and the attacking options.",
      "Now, it's time for the centre of the park. While that seemed likely to be the focus of the recruitment team anyway, that need has been accelerated due to Casemiro's situation.",
      "Man United have confirmed that Casemiro will leave the club this summer at the end of his contract, with the decision made not to trigger the extra year that is included as a clause in his deal.",
      "The Brazilian was one of the last major investments in the midfield, with around £60m spent on securing him from Real Madrid in 2022.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FB PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "While there have been some highlights, it seems United are keen to move on and look at the future beyond the 33-year-old, which puts greater emphasis on their deals in the summer.",
      "So, with that said, here's a look at a few potential replacements for Casemiro in the transfer market, and what they could offer the team in the years ahead.",
      "Adam Wharton has already proved he has the skills and qualities to slot into any Premier League squad at present. However, given he is currently wanted by the likes of Real Madrid, Manchester City, Liverpool and Spurs, United will face stiff competition in securing his services this summer.",
      "A fee north of £65m could also await any interested parties, given the 21-year-old is already Premier League proven.",
      "While Wharton is thought to be United's main interest at present, it is thought that Elliot Anderson is also being monitored. The 23-year-old has been a shining light in a struggling Nottingham Forest squad this season, but a deal will not come cheap.",
      "That's because the Tricky Trees have reportedly slapped Anderson with a price tag of around £100m.",
      "United pursued Carlos Baleba for the majority of the summer, only to be put off by Brighton's £100m valuation of the 22-year-old. An interest still remains in the midfielder and it will be interesting to see if the Seagulls' stance on letting him leave the south coast changes this summer.",
      "Joao Gomes has excelled with Wolves despite the club staring directly down the barrel of imminent relegation. The MEN reported earlier this week that a loan with an obligation to buy for the 24-year-old would be a most likely move. Wolves reportedly want £40m to let him leave midway through 2025/26.",
      "Like Baleba, United found themselves linked with Real Madrid's Eduardo Camavinga in the summer. The 23-year-old has been a revelation at the Bernabeu, with Arsenal and Liverpool said to be monitoring him. It was reported last month that Los Blancos will listen to offers around the £87m mark."

      "Should United wish to pick up the three points on Sunday, they will have to do so without Matthijs de Ligt in the team. The Dutchman has not featured for the Reds since the 2-1 victory at Crystal Palace at the end of November. Initial thoughts were that the back injury was not going to be serious.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FACEBOOK PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "In his first press conference, Carrick said: \"He has been carrying a bit of an issue, but hopefully, we'll get him back in some time soon. It's been a little bit slower than what they thought previously.\" In training on Wednesday, De Ligt was not spotted with his teammates.",
      "Joshua Zirkzee was also missing in training on Wednesday, having not made the squad for the City game last weekend either. The Dutchman is understood to have a small injury, which ensured he watched the derby from the stands last weekend. Zirkzee was captured telling a fan he would be out for two weeks.",
      "Like United, Arsenal's injury and absence issues appear to be easing. Cristhian Mosquera made a long-awaited return to the pitch for the Gunners in midweek against Inter in the Champions League. However, Max Dowman is expected to remain out for the game.",
      "Dowman is expected to make his return next month after suffering a problem to his foot. Piero Hincapie's groin injury, picked up against Liverpool earlier this month, should also keep him out of the clash with United.",
      "There is uncertainty as to when the centre-back will be in contention again, but there is a hope it will be before February. Finally, Arsenal are also set to be without Riccardo Calafiori.",
      "Arteta confirmed last week that the Italian would be out for a few weeks, but the exact timescale was unclear. A return before the United game does seem unlikely though.",

      "It was the early days of the Beckham dynasty, which saw them become one of the most iconic families in the celebrity world.

      "Beckham wasn't the only player Salgado took under his wing. Former Liverpool winger Steve McManaman, who spent four years at the Spanish giants, also benefited from the ex-Blackburn Rovers defender's linguistic skills.",
      "\"I remember in my first day at Real Madrid pre-season,\" recalled Salgado. \"At that time, we were sharing rooms and they said, 'You're sharing with the English guy, Steven McManaman'.",

      "Oliver Glasner launched a stunning attack on his Crystal Palace bosses as he prepares to leave Selhurst Park(Image: )",
      "Having just got rid of one combustible head coach who rarely sticks to the script in public, Manchester United won't be rushing to appoint another. That's why Oliver Glasner's remarkable rant against his Crystal Palace bosses after defeat at Sunderland on Saturday was such a risk.",
      "Glasner's candidancy for the Old Trafford hotseat has dimmed a little in recent weeks, a downturn in results at Selhurst Park not helping him at a time when he needs his stock to be climbing. So getting the flamethrower out at the Stadium of Light on Saturday was an interesting strategy.",
      "Palace had just made it 10 games without a win when Glasner took studious aim at those above him for doing a deal with Manchester City for captain Marc Guehi on the eve of the game. Glasner had confirmed on Friday that he was leaving Selhurst Park at the end of the season, and much like Ruben Amorim did in his final weekend at Old Trafford, the Austrian decided one public meltdown wasn't quite enough.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FACEBOOK PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "\"The players gave everything they could. We made no substitutions - look at the bench, there are just kids there,\" he said. \"We feel like we're being abandoned completely. Selling our captain one day before a game - there is no understanding for this.",
      "\"We are preparing and then yesterday [Friday], I get told that our captain will be sold, but why not next week? At least he can play this game and then next week, other players are coming back. It makes me really upset.",
      "\"If your heart gets ripped out twice a year, with [Eberechi] Eze one day before a game in the summer and your captain one day before a game - I've just got no understanding.",
      "\"I've been in football for 30 years and never experienced this, not once. Now it happens twice in six or seven months. That's just where we are now.\"",
      "This is a remarkable attack on the club employing him and the comparisons with Amorim's stunning broadside at United executives at Leeds earlier this month are obvious. Amorim's position became untenable after his remarks, but Palace seem determined to limp on with the manager who only eight months ago won them their first major trophy.",
      "Ruben Amorim could be a loose cannon in press conferences at Manchester United(Image: Ash Donelon/Manchester United via Getty Images)",
      "In truth, this has probably been coming all season. Glasner threatened to quit at the end of the summer transfer window if Guehi was sold to Liverpool. He won the battle that day, but he was never going to win the war. Palace's business model doesn't allow players of Guehi's quality to leave for free, so City's £20million offer was £20million they couldn't afford to turn down.",
      "None of this should really come as a surprise. Palace chairman Steve Parish has made the business plan clear often enough. Glasner referenced Eberechi Eze as well, but that was another transfer that looked a certainty all summer and is just what clubs like Palace have to do.",
      "It is depressing for Glasner, depressing for Palace, and depressing for most football fans that any club with the cheek to lay down a challenge to the elite soon finds the vultures circling overhead.",
      "This is what happens when a hungry and ambitious manager ends up taking charge at one of the Premier League's upwardly mobile, middle-class clubs. Andoni Iraola probably deserves more credit than he is getting for biting his tongue at Bournemouth when his players are sold from under him as well.",
      "Glasner and Iraola are two of the standout candidates for the Old Trafford vacancy, but are now balancing disappointing runs of form at the worst possible time, and both have lost their best player during January. You can understand the frustration.",
      "Bournemouth and Crystal Palace have sold Antoine Semenyo and Marc Guehi in January(Image: )",
      "Granted, Glasner does have history here. He left Eintracht Frankfurt after disagreements with sporting director Markus Krosche over the strength of the squad, and at Wolfsburg, he clashed with Jorg Schmadtke over what he felt were broken promises to improve the squad.",
      "The common theme here is a manager pushing for more at clubs whose natural habitat is the middle ground. Is that enough to cast the 51-year-old as a loose cannon, or does a CV including a Europa League with Eintracht Frankfurt and an FA Cup with Crystal Palace suggest he has earned a crack at the highest level?",
      "His ambitions would be easier to meet at an elite club, while he's hardly alone in being a manager or a head coach who sometimes disagrees with those above him. The challenge for Omar Berrada and Jason Wilcox at United would be to manage that kind of personality rather than fall into the trap of a compliant yes-man.",
      "That's not to say Glasner is the outstanding candidate here. His CV does make him deserving of a crack at a bigger job, but there are concerns. Top of the list is that his best results have come with a back three, a system United will want to steer clear of. Recent results at Palace have also cost the club and Glasner momentum.",
      "Those are reasons for Berrada and Wilcox to think twice about approaching a manager who is on the market this summer and has Premier League experience. Worrying about what a boss with ambitions beyond the likes of Crystal Palace and Eintracht Frankfurt might say in public is not.",

      "Manchester United travel to Arsenal on Sunday looking to continue their good performance vs Manchester City(Image: Robbie Jay Barratt - AMA/Getty Images)",
      "Michael Carrick may as well have been lauded as a tactical genius after Manchester United produced a performance which shocked the Premier League to beat Manchester City 2-0 at Old Trafford. On another day, had it not been for marginal offsides and some incredible reflex stops by Gianluigi Donnarumma, it could have been more.",
      "But United fans are not greedy, particularly after a performance that inspiring, and the hope is there that they can continue this form as they push for a spot in the top four. The game plan Carrick implemented against City was not expected considering how he liked his Middlesbrough team to dominate the ball in the Championship.",
      "However, he was pragmatic and had confidence his defence could keep out City's threats and hit them on the counter attack. This tactic worked to perfection. Senne Lammens made one ill-advised save for a shot that was going well off target but otherwise, had nothing to do.",
      "Meanwhile, at the other end, the Reds had ten shots, seven of which were on target. It was a case of quality over quantity and all of this came from just 32 per cent possession. The beauty of Carrick's game plan was how positive it was without the need to dominate the ball.",
      "United were patient, picked their moments and deserved the victory. While this game plan will need changing for matches against teams who the Reds, on paper, should be dominant over, they can copy and paste it for the clash with Arsenal on Sunday.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FB PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "At Nottingham Forest this weekend, Arsenal had 60 per cent possession and tried their best to break down their opponents only to settle for a point. United sitting deep and then playing with pace on the break is arguably their best chance of stopping the runaway leaders.",
      "Mikel Arteta will be mindful of this but it is one thing knowing what is about to come, and another thing stopping it. However, what United need to be wary of, which they did not have to concern themselves with against City, is the Gunners' threat from set pieces.",
      "All the way back on the opening day of the season, United managed to hold their own against the north London club only to be caught out by a corner. There were suspicions of a foul which were waved away but Altay Bayindir was not strong enough and the goal was a poor one to concede.",
      "Last season, United were atrocious when it came to defending set pieces but they have managed to make some progress in the 2025/26 season. Lammens seems more commanding in the area and as a result, goals being conceded in this manner have dropped.",
      "But Arsenal are the specialists and you would expect this week, Carrick will be drilling in the importance of being alert at all times and how each set piece routine is a huge threat. The Gunners have the best squad in the Premier League and they are also a more physical side to most.",
      "Gabriel and William Saliba are wrecking balls at corners and United need to stand up and be counted. That is why you would expect Harry Maguire to start thanks to his aerial abilities.",
      "United have been accused of having a soft underbelly in the past but if they can replicate what they did against City at the Emirates Stadium, they will banish those criticisms.",

      "The Dutchman watched from the directors' box at Old Trafford as his team-mates secured a dominant 2-0 victory, which handed Michael Carrick a dream start to his interim role.",

      "When Patrick Dorgu scored with 14 minutes remaining, Zirkzee was pictured celebrating in the directors' box alongside Matthijs de Ligt, Tom Heaton, Tyler Fredricson and Shea Lacey.",
      "United sources have confirmed Zirkzee's absence was due to a knock he suffered against Brighton. The 24-year-old was captured telling a fan outside Old Trafford that he would be sidelined for \"two weeks\", and it remains to be seen whether the issue affects his future in the final two weeks of the January window.",

      "Casemiro and Diogo Dalot cel;ebrate Bryan Mbeumo's goal against Manchester City(Image: )",
      "It was *only* the League Cup but Manchester United's victory against Newcastle United at Wembley on the final weekend of February 2023 felt like so much more. It was a first trophy in six years and came just days after Barcelona had been vanquished at Old Trafford. There haven't been many better weeks for this club in recent history.",
      "It really did feel at the time like Erik ten Hag had got it sussed - which in itself is a reminder that nobody should be getting carried away now - and there are a few scenes from that final that still linger in the memory. A couple of them feature Casemiro.",
      "Given the highs and lows he has experienced at Old Trafford since a £70million move from Real Madrid, it is easy to forget now just how good the Brazil international was in his first season. But it wasn't just the quality of his football that stood out, it was the whole package.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FACEBOOK PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "At one point at Wembley, with United 2-0 up and the clock ticking towards half-time, Casemiro forced Joelinton out of play to earn a goal kick and celebrated wildly in front of the fans behind that goal. He turned back to the pitch and exchanged high fives and chest bumps with Diogo Dalot, Raphael Varane and Lisandro Martinez.",
      "Then, with the game in its dying stages and the United fans already celebrating, Casemiro let rip at Bruno Fernandes for not passing. It was still 2-0, the game was done, but in the eyes of a five-time Champions League winner, the decision of Fernandes not to pass to a teammate in a better position was still worthy of admonishment.",
      "A few days later Ten Hag was asked about Casemiro and his answers told us a lot about why United had spent so much money on a player entering his 30s, a decision that would later be questioned by Sir Jim Ratcliffe as he put together his investment into the club.",
      "Ten Hag explained he had wanted players with \"character\" and \"personality\" in his first transfer window and said Casemiro was already the man who set the standards at United. His argument with Fernandes at Wembley showed that \"good isn't good enough\".",
      "\"For me it’s always the same, you have players who win, and who win always, and players who lose and are always losing,\" said Ten Hag. \"You have to do your research and find the type who will win and who are cooperative in the dressing room, to be humble, but when on the pitch they take responsibility.\"",
      "That summed up Casemiro at the time and although his influence waned when it appeared his legs had gone, his performance against Manchester City on Saturday was a reminder that at his best, he is still a setter of standards and a winner at heart.",
      "In May 2024, Jamie Carragher famously said of Casemiro that \"football's left him at this top level\". Over the past 18 months he has managed to rediscover it and prove he still has a role to play, but it feels like the clock is ticking on his United career.",
      "His contract expires at the end of this season and a renewal isn't looking likely at the moment. There is a one-year option on that deal which will be triggered if he starts 35 games this season, a tally he will hit if he starts all of the remaining 16 games. That is considered extremely unlikely and given the option would mean Casemiro's deal extends for another year on his £350,000-a-week salary if United are in the Champions League, it is almost impossible to see happening.",
      "If there is any chance of the holding midfielder staying, it is only on reduced wages, but as it stands, a departure at the end of the season seems most likely, although the churn in midfield could have a part to play in any decision. Bruno Fernandes' future is uncertain, as is that of Manuel Ugarte, who has interest from Europe this month and is yet to establish himself at United.",
      "It does feel like this might be the time to say goodbye, however. Casemiro turns 34 next month and United's midfield needs a rebuild. His salary has dropped to closer to £300,000-a-week due to the lack of European football, but that is a big sum that could be reinvested in a younger midfielder. It's more than £14million a season.",
      "There is no doubt he would be missed. As good as he was on Saturday, the Casemiro scenes that made their way to social media were after he had been taken off. He celebrated Mason Mount's disallowed goal by jumping on Michael Carrick's back and then running on to the pitch for a big embrace with Martinez.",
      "The Brazilian and Argentine arrived in the same summer and both fitted the bill for \"character\" and \"personality\". Nearly four years later, they keep delivering on that front.",

      "Bryan Mbeumo is making a similar impact to Bruno Fernandes at Manchester United(Image: )",
      "The debate over Manchester United's best signing since the end of the Sir Alex Ferguson era is a short one. Bruno Fernandes stands head and shoulders above the rest in just about every category imaginable.",
      "The Portuguese is a big game player who has delivered time and again when it matters most. For quality, for impact, for longevity, he ticks every box. At the end of next week, he will celebrate six years at Old Trafford and he is still the best player at the club.",
      "United paid an initial £47million to sign Fernandes from Sporting and even if that fee rises to the potential £67million if every add-on is met, it will still be exceptional value. The 31-year-old could yet be approaching the endgame at Old Trafford, but if he does depart, it will leave a significant hole in the team.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FACEBOOK PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "Fernandes stands out for his quality, but also for his rarity. United's recruitment had been haphazard over the last 13 years and there haven't been anywhere near enough success stories to match Fernandes.",
      "Zlatan Ibrahimovic was a good free transfer, but his impact was short-term. Luke Shaw looks a good deal because of the length of time he has survived at the club. Ander Herrera was a solid acquisition, so too Casemiro, although his fee was big for a 30-year-old. Lisandro Martinez might be up there but for the bad luck he has suffered with injuries.",
      "It is early days, but United's summer spending spree looks like a better investment. Senne Lammens has been good, Matheus Cunha has flickered and Benjamin Sesko has shown promise for a young striker. But Bryan Mbeumo sticks out above them all.",
      "The 26-year-old produced another exceptional attacking display in Saturday's derby victory, taking his goal superbly and running himself into the ground in a centre-forward role that demanded he pull City's defenders out of position. Mbeumo forced Gianluigi Donnarumma into an excellent save and looked to be relishing the big occasion.",
      "He has made a habit of that since his initial £65million move from Brentford in the summer. The question for players when they make a step up of that size is how they will cope in the harsher spotlight. Mbeumo had Premier League experience, but a CV consisting of Troyes and Brentford couldn't prepare him for this.",
      "That he has hit the ground running is a positive sign. It is exactly what Fernandes did in the second half of the 2019/20 season, when he immediately looked like he belonged and took responsibility in a United shirt.",
      "Mbeumo's return of eight goals and an assist in 18 appearances for United is good, but just as encouraging is who he has made an impact against. There have now been goals against Liverpool, Tottenham and City. He is proving key in the biggest games and after his performance at the weekend, he will fancy a crack at Arsenal on Sunday.",
      "He has a long way to go to match the contribution Fernandes has made at United, but this has been an excellent start. For too long, United managers have had to rely solely on Fernandes as the big-game hunter. He has always been the player you turn to when the team needs a spark.",
      "Now, Mbeumo is showing evidence that he can be there as well. It was no surprise that the two of them teamed up to create the first goal against Pep Guardiola's side at the weekend.",
      "Recruitment has long been a major issue at United, but Mbeumo is shaping up to be a success story.",

      "Incredibly, after one of the most impressive Manchester United performances in some time, the main sub-plot coming out of the Manchester derby is a rift between Paul Scholes, Nicky Butt and Lisandro Martinez. In the build-up to the derby, the former United midfielders gave a scathing critique of the Argentine on their podcast - The Good, The Bad and The Football.",
      "\"Martinez against [Erling] Haaland,\" Scholes said before wincing. Butt responded: “Haaland would pick Martinez up and run with him. You know when you see a dad at school running down the road with a little toddler?” The legendary midfielder added: “He’d score, then throw him in the net.”",
      "It was an outburst which raised eyebrows among the United fanbase as their comments went beyond normal punditry criticism, towards, at best, immature teasing of a professional footballer. Fittingly, Martinez started and impressed at Old Trafford on Saturday as he helped keep the Norwegian quiet, including producing a timely block to stop the striker.",

      "With a 2-0 victory under their belt, it seemed the matter had been put to rest until the Argentine spoke in the mixed zone afterwards. \"Honestly, he [Scholes] can say whatever he wants. I told him already, if he wants to say something to me, he can come to wherever he wants.\"",
      "Unsurprisingly, Scholes was quick to respond. \"Someone's had a good game, was really happy for you... Tea, no sugar please Lisandro Martinez.\" For now, that is where the back and forth ends but the whole saga has threatened to overshadow what was a brilliant victory in Michael Carrick's return fixture.",
      "Martinez had every right to respond to Scholes after the victory over City and that result obviously empowered him to speak out. Scholes is also no stranger to ruffling a few feathers with his takes.",
      "Back in December, he branded Ruben Amorim's handling of Kobbie Mainoo as 'b*******' while Butt and Scholes agreed they would advise him to leave United if he to asked their opinion. Pundits should never be mere mouthpieces for the clubs they used to play for.",
      "But some pundits and ex United players are not holding back. Gary Neville was cited by Amorim over claims his criticism was influencing the club's decision makers while Roy Keane was scathing about the appointment of Jonny Evans to the backroom staff and took a pot-shot at Carrick's wife on the Stick to Football podcast after a social media spat during the midfielder's playing days.",
      "In an age where outrage sells, especially on social media, it is unsurprising to see punditry comments become a bit clos to the bone. Martinez and other United players should also be encouraged to respond to it, if they see fit.",
      "But, Martinez and his teammates are only in their right to respond if they are happy to hold their hands up when things are not going as well. It is telling when United win a match, social media is awash with posts from the squad celebrating and thanking the fans.",
      "Yet, when they lose, apologies are few and far between. Perhaps this is partly down to PRs advising their clients to keep quiet but it does come across as disingenuous to seemingly only comment after a win.",
      "Now that both men have had their say, it is time for a line to be drawn underneath this saga and for Martinez to continue doing his talking on the pitch. If he continues to perform well, the critics will have little reason to speak out.",

      "Lammens made an impressive debut against Sunderland.(Image: Getty Images)",
      "Senne Lammens wore a polo shirt and a navy sweatshirt when he visited Old Trafford after signing for Manchester United. The young goalkeeper looked as though he could be joining United to work in their HR department.",
      "The same observation was made when Lammens reported for international duty with Belgium last week - the 23-year-old was dressed in a beige collared jacket, a khaki t-shirt and chinos.",
      "\"By accident, I saw an article saying he was wearing something boring when he reported for international duty and fans saying they hoped he stays like this,\" laughed Hayk Milkon, one of Lammens' former coaches.",
      "\"This 'boringness' is just the way Senne is, he's really calm and no excesses. He focuses on what he needs to focus on and is open with the people around him. He keeps his feet on the ground.\"",
      "If Lammens looks like someone who could work in an office, every workplace would love to have him in their five-a-side team. United believe they have signed a young goalkeeper with huge potential, and fans who were present at Old Trafford against Sunderland left the stadium buzzing about his debut.",
      "The quirk is that Lammens appears to be a different person when he wears his goalkeeper kit. He made a supremely confident United debut, aggressively commanded his area and kept a clean sheet.",
      "Milkon coached Lammens during their time together at Club Brugge. Milkon is now the youngest manager in the Belgian top-flight and Lammens plays for the biggest club in England.",
      "\"It was Senne with his headphones on. He would go into the gym to do his recovery or some extra top-ups. Or he would just go to relax by playing basketball - he loved to play basketball.\"",
      "Lammens celebrates against Sunderland. (Image: 2025 Ben Roberts - Danehouse)",
      "Milkon coached in different roles at Club Brugge. He was the assistant of Club NXT (their reserve team), served as their interim manager, was in charge of the Under-18s and eventually became a first-team coach.",
      "His time at Club Brugge coincided with Lammens progressing from the academy to their first team, so he is uniquely positioned to provide insight into United's new goalkeeper signing.",
      "Lammens joined Club Brugge's academy when he was 12. \"He was a guy with huge potential,\" said Milkon. \"As I learned from colleagues who had worked with him when he was much younger, I heard there was a moment that clicked in his head when he became super professional.",
      "\"He was one of the guys during Covid - when the players were not able to train - who was doing a lot at home, he was really going far with this to be the best in these types of areas.",
      "\"Then he continued like this when he joined the first team to train with them. He always wanted to improve. We also had something in place to look at the parameters on which goalkeepers are judged.",
      "\"You see the potential of the goalkeeper based on what they do in games; so their positioning, their decision-making and so on, and Senne was always quite high in these areas.",
      "\"The only bad luck that he had was that the first-team goalkeeper was Simon Mignolet. He's an amazing goalkeeper, so it was difficult for Senne to stay over there in the role of No.2.",
      "\"That would have also blocked his growth, so it was good for him in the end to make the step to go to Antwerp and he did a tremendous job there. It was amazing to see how fast he adapted.\"",
      "Milkon pictured during his stint with Club Brugge (he now manages F.C.V. Dender).(Image: )",
      "Milkon continued: \"I think for us at Club Brugge, it was very clear to everyone that Senne was a top goalkeeper. He would have been the perfect fit for Club Brugge to be the No.1.",
      "\"That was not possible because Mignolet was there. But the parameters that we used to judge his performances indicated he was ticking so many boxes already, and he was consistently doing it.",
      "\"There weren't ups and downs with his performances. He was consistently really high and when you compare this to the top goalkeepers, you have a benchmark to say 'Ok, what potential does this guy have?'",
      "\"He had some chances with the first team at Club Brugge and made a mistake, or maybe two, but in the end it was very clear to everyone that he was a top goalkeeper.",
      "\"It was impossible to try to extend his contract because, again, you have Mignolet, and you cannot block a guy like this. You know he has to go out, he has to play, and he will improve even more.\"",
      "When asked about Lammens' strengths, he said: \"I would say that his decision-making was very good. He is very calm, he sees the solutions on the pitch, he has a quick reaction time and understands the balance between risk and reward, and which decisions are the right ones to make.",
      "\"His clean passing is great, his footwork was really good, and he's just an amazing goalkeeper with the shot-stopping. He made some incredible saves back then already. He's quite a complete goalkeeper.",
      "\"But making the right decisions at a very young age, being very mature with this, was really impressive. And the fact that he is good with both feet is another big strength.",
      "\"For me, Senne is a very calm guy and has all the qualities to be a top professional. That was my impression when I first met him when he was younger and he never changed.\"",
      "A baby-faced Lammens playing for Club Brugge in 2021. (Image: 2021 BSR Agency)",
      "Lammens joined Royal Antwerp on a free transfer in the summer of 2023. He was handed his debut a few months later and served as an understudy that season, but earned first-choice status for 2024/2025.",
      "His performances drew attention from the Belgian media. Lammens saved four penalties across a successful first full campaign and received a call-up to Belgium's senior squad in March.",
      "Milkon said: \"I was not surprised when I saw Manchester United had come calling. And to record his first clean sheet, I was really happy for him. Senne is a potential No.1 for the Red Devils - the Belgium national team.",
      "\"He got his chance, he took it, and we're all really proud of him, but we knew it would happen. I believe he has all the capabilities to become the best in the world, so I wish him all the best. I'm sure he will have a very good career in England, and Manchester United should return to the big club they used to be.",
      "\"He will have a positive impact on that, for sure, and hopefully he will be Belgium's first-choice goalkeeper soon. I believe he has the potential, the skillset and the personality to do that.",
      "\"For me, it was just having a tiny little part in having an influence on him at Brugge, but it was the most positive memories of our relationship that we had during this spell.",
      "\"I'm very proud that he is reaching these high levels and not surprised. I believe he will be successful because he is a guy who will not change his focus or start to do something different. He is calm, that's his personality and character, and he wants to succeed. He is hungry and will keep working to be his best.",
      "\"He is so calm, and you have to be patient in football. You cannot worry too much and want things too early, but finding the balance between not being impatient and, at the same time, pushing and demanding what you deserve in a good way, means everything will sort itself out.\"",
      "Lammens in action for Royal Antwerp in 2024. (Image: Photonews 2024)",
      "United staff who have worked with Lammens at Carrington have echoed Milkon's sentiments. He has been described as \"really mature for his age\" and is said to have taken the move in his stride.",
      "Lammens is understood to have impressed coaches during training sessions and a United source said that lots of people have been speaking positively about him. He has already relocated from the luxury hotel where he was initially staying and into a house.",
      "It's no surprise that Lammens likes to play basketball at 6ft 3in, but he is a keen golfer, which is common ground with the likes of Tom Heaton, Luke Shaw, Mason Mount and Harry Maguire.",
      "Matthijs de Ligt, Amad, Maguire and Shaw jogged straight to Lammens to congratulate him after full-time against Sunderland. \"Are you Schmeichel in disguise?\" was chanted at Lammens from the Stretford End.",
      "It remains to be seen whether Lammens will start against Liverpool on Sunday, but it would be a surprise to see him on the bench after delivering a strong debut before the international break.",
      "There would be nothing boring about keeping another clean sheet - this time at Anfield.",
      "Kitbag has slashed the price of Man United kits and merch with up to 50% off select items.",

      "Man Utd interim boss Michael Carrick is likely to be “in the mix” to become the permanent Red Devils manager in the summer, according to David Ornstein.",
      "The Red Devils sacked Ruben Amorim a fortnight ago as they looked to turn around their results and performances this season.",
      "After Darren Fletcher had taken the next two matches, Man Utd appointed Carrick as their interim boss until the end of the campaign.",
      "Man Utd made an incredible start under Carrick by beating arch-rivals Man City 2-0 but the scoreline could have been even more impressive for the Red Devils.",
      "The Red Devils will decide on a permanent replacement for Amorim at the end of the season with numerous managers linked to the job in the summer.",
      "And now, according to Ornstein of The Athletic, Carrick stands a decent chance of landing the full-time gig in the summer despite losing his job at Championship side Middlesbrough earlier this season.",
      "READ: Paul Scholes should ‘f**king grow up’ as shock four-man Manchester United midfielder shortlist ‘revealed’",
      "Ornstein revealed in conversation with Duncan Castles on The Transfers Podcast: “Carrick will naturally enter the conversation depending on how well he does. But I don’t think this is binary, as it was with Ole Gunner Solskjaer. United should run their process properly: speak to available coaches, assess those in work where permitted, look at data, styles and profiles.",
      "“Last time, it came down to Thomas Tuchel and Erik ten Hag. Others like Frank and Pochettino were considered. There are weeks and months now to do that work. Carrick could play himself into contention, or he might decide it’s not the right moment.",
      "“There’s nothing firm right now. It’s hypothetical. But given his qualities, what he showed in his brief United spell before, and his work at Middlesbrough, there’s no reason he shouldn’t at least be in the conversation – much like Kieran McKenna was previously.",
      "“Carrick could be in the mix, but that doesn’t mean he’ll get the job. It’s very much a case of wait and see how it unfolds.”",
      "And Ornstein thinks Carrick ticks one crucial box for the Man Utd hierarchy as they look to bring in the right man to succeed Amorim in the summer.",
      "Ornstein added: “I also understand why United went for a figure with a connection to the club. Lifting spirits, restoring smiles and confidence matters, even if it sounds trite. It’s not everything, but it helps.",
      "“A lot has lifted off the club since the change. That’s no disrespect to Amorim, who I think will go on to have an excellent career.”",

      "Paul Scholes will be neither apologising nor shutting up about Lisandro Martinez, while Manchester United have ‘revealed’ a four-man midfielder shortlist.",
      "It is almost impossible to perceive the names Manchester United will be targeting in their summer midfield overhaul.",
      "But we start with the story that just will not die despite one side keeping their counsel.",
      "Big fan of Paul Scholes discussing his ongoing and almost entirely one-sided feud with Lisandro Martinez on The Overlap and admitting that “what we said probably wasn’t great”, “the way we described it probably wasn’t great and we probably shouldn’t have done that”, and “I can see why he was offended by it and we probably worded it not in a great way”.",

      "A couple of points:",
      "1) Is it still Martinez who needs to “f**king grow up”?",
      "2) Is anyone going to tell Scholes or Butt to stop talking about it, or is that advice preserved only for the footballer who responded to one journalist’s question and has remained silent since on both social media and the world’s many billion podcasts?",

      "If something else happened, the reaction would not be the same. Yes. That is a true thing to have said, Joleon. You are correct.

      "As a Man United fan, 4-4-2 raised me. Two proper strikers (even though early Rooney and Ronaldo as mutated 10s and 9s still give me chills). Wingers who actually crossed and celebrated acrobatically after goals. Fullbacks who knew their only job was ‘run and vibes’. This formation won leagues, broke Arsenal (a fave past time), and made defenders fear actual human beings instead of inverted zombies.",

      "In my view, much has been made of Arsenal’s reliance on set pieces this season, as evidence of a limited / pragmatic / neanderthal approach (take your pick). I think this misunderstands both the cause and the context.",
      "For the last decade and a half, elite football was dominated by positional, ball-heavy systems (70% possession, extreme technical prowess, territory control, cut-backs from the edge of the box) perfected by Guardiola’s genius. The natural response to that dominance for teams with lesser (but not insignificant) resources was resistance: better-coached mid-blocks, aggressive man-marking, and sophisticated rest-defence structures, especially among mid-table PL sides (who, remember, have more money and thus better players – not comparable to the best teams tactically, but fit for purpose of the type of game they planned to play).",
      "In other words, the league got better at stopping positional football.",
      "That tactical shift reduced open-play volume for everyone, including Arsenal (remember the fluent team of 22-23). Set pieces, IMO, are not the cause of this evolution but a rational response to it. Arsenal and a few others (notably Chelsea) have leaned into them because they are one of the few remaining repeatable advantages against compact, well-drilled defences.",
      "Arteta’s use of set pieces, to me, looks less like dogma and more like a stopgap i.e. an efficient (if not aesthetic) solution while the next attacking evolution is being worked out. Guardiola, interestingly, has not yet leaned into that lever to the same extent. His old road’s rapidly agin’, but if anyone can come up with an elegant solution, it’s him.",
      "The broader point is this: set-piece dominance is not evidence of regression. It is evidence of adaptation in a league where defensive organisation has finally caught up with positional purity (and I would say bettered it). A more elegant attacking solution will emerge. It always does. But dismissing the current phase as ‘set-piece FC’ misses the tactical story entirely.",

The point of using Dynasty as a term was not that it was a direct alternative to ‘DNA’ but because DNA is being used so ephemerally, with no concrete concepts other than attacking and exciting (which any team could say they want and have had iterations of their team that have done that before), but that Dynasty implies a one-time event.  It doesn’t flow over to a later version of the team 10, 20 or more years later. Whether we like ‘Americanisations’ or not, it better reflects what happens for teams that dominate an era than DNA. Especially when it is trotted out, again, after one win. My other point was that the confidence that oozed through a team of round pegs in round holes was far more instrumental in the win than DNA.",

      "Arsenal v Man United and Newcastle v Aston Villa are games that give us all a chance to stop and consider just how much things have changed since August, while also confirming that, for the millionth Premier League weekend in a row, it is once again officially Big. A Big Weekend.",
      "There’s also Mo Salah back in Premier League action post-AFCON, while who knows how many more chances we have left to enjoy Oliver Glasner at Crystal Palace before he huffs right off for good?",
      "",
      "A fun thing about this weekend is that it’s the return fixtures from the opening game of the season. It’s just nice to see how different teams’ seasons have panned out and what clues or misdirections were evident back in the sunny days of August.",
      "At Old Trafford on the first Super Sunday of the season, Arsenal ran out slightly fortunate 1-0 winners in a game that prompted significant outpourings of optimism from home supporters despite the result.",
      "Arsenal, meanwhile, offered only unconvincing early evidence that this could at long last be their season, and Viktor Gyokeres looked like he might be a dud.",
      "It soon became clear that Man United were still quite cack, and that it was in fact Arsenal’s season. Good call on Gyokeres, though, who is truly Dud of Dud Hall.",
      "Ruben Amorim has gone, of course, and Michael Carrick continues his gentle start to life as United’s latest sacrificial Fergie Boy by attempting to follow up last weekend’s Arsenal-assisting win over Man City with a Man City-assisting win over Arsenal.",
      "If he does it, they’ll probably give him the permanent job on the spot, because this is a football club that simply refuses to learn.",
      "More likely is that Arsenal win in rather more convincing fashion than they did at Old Trafford and it all takes a little while longer before Carrick manages to stumble home in fifth and claim a Champions League spot on the back of the effort of the teams who are actually in it this season. And then gets appointed to the permanent job, because this is a football club that simply refuses to learn.",
      "Arsenal will by that point have long been crowned champions, with the bald truth that there really doesn’t seem like there’s much anyone else in the division can do about it. The bigger question is how many other pots and pans they might take home.",
      "",
      "Let’s continue the theme of August reminiscences, because in few places would the contrast appear more initially stark than at Aston Villa.",
      "They began the season with a grim goalless draw against the Newcastle side that had pipped them to Champions League football on the final day of 24/25 in a game that very much continued the trending themes at the time for two clubs who had endured awkward and unsatisfactory summers.",
      "For Villa it would set a trend that would extend into September and a five-game winless run to start the season that didn’t even contain a goal until that fifth game.",
      "Then they just won pretty much all the games for an extended period of time to become brief yet genuine title contenders.",
      "But the reopening of the transfer window has brought back familiar doubts and truths, and despite Villa occupying an enviable position in the table and appearing certainties for Champions League football next season there is now once again a distinct sense of a buzz harshed.",
      "Frustration at rules that bind them while being more easily navigated by the established big clubs, of simply not being allowed to compete on even terms with Newcastle, never mind the cosseted Big Six. Even the stupidest members of that group are annoying Villa. Especially the stupidest members.",
      "A look at the table suggests this angst is misplaced; Villa remain closer to Arsenal than they do to fifth place, which will almost certainly be enough to achieve what Villa set out to achieve this season and which they looked a million miles away from doing back in August.",
      "But time and results and other factors all have a funny way of shifting those sands beneath your feet. And with a slight dip in results and the return of the transfer window with its now familiar frustrations, there’s just a nagging sense that Villa are neither as happy as they should be, nor as they were just a few short weeks ago.",
      "",
      "Liverpool’s wildly unconvincing yet improbably lengthy unbeaten run featured a rarity on Wednesday night, as a truly convincing performance put a dangerous Marseille side to the sword in a richly deserved 3-0 triumph.",
      "Liverpool impressed from front to back, while Arne Slot got pretty much everything right as well in dealing with an awkward and ever-shifting opponent.",
      "But perhaps the best thing about the night for Liverpool was that at the end of it almost nobody was talking about Mo Salah. He went straight into the starting line-up on his return from AFCON and had neither an eye-catchingly good nor poor game – there was one glaring late miss which he somehow contrived to send away from goal rather than towards it, but apart from that.",
      "Yet it didn’t ever really feel like it was of desperate importance. It would have seemed mad to think a month ago when Salah left for AFCON with his entire Liverpool future seemingly up in the air that his return six weeks later could be so low-key, such a footnote on a night of good news.",
      "His first Premier League appearance since December 13 is likely to attract more eyeballs and greater attention, though. We eagerly await to discover what kind.",
      "",
      "We now know for sure it’s when not if as far as Glasner’s Palace exit is concerned. Technically it’s not supposed to happen until the end of the season, but it feels absurd to suggest this now clearly broken marriage can stagger on that long. Especially if Palace continue on their current downward trajectory that sees them without a Premier League win in their last seven games and suffering the FA Cup’s biggest ever giant-killing.",
      "Carrying on doesn’t look like it’s going to do much good for either Palace or Glasner in the long run. Palace find themselves now slipping uncomfortably close to the fringes of relegation bother, while continuing with Palace for much longer could yet see Glasner play himself out of what currently looks like a near-certain shot at a Big Six job next season.",
      "It’s not inconceivable that four of that group could be seeking a new permanent manager in the summer, and Glasner is high in the lists for all of those jobs.",
      "But he won’t be if he spends the next three months angrily losing to everyone to prove his undeniably valid point about the lack of support he’s received.",
      "If he’s not careful, he’ll end up with Tottenham as his best option, which would be a real daftness in the current climate.",
      "",
      "Funny old time for Middlesbrough, who are busy trying to get themselves back into the Premier League while watching their two most recent managers getting themselves appointed into it.",
      "Michael Carrick has failed upwards to Manchester United, while Rob Edwards surely couldn’t have imagined an undeniably impressive few months at the Riverside would so swiftly get him back in the big time.",
      "Boro have kept on keeping on, though, under Kim Hellberg and still firmly in the hunt for automatic promotion with the play-offs looking like a worst-case safety net.",
      "Preston are themselves still very much part of that picture, still just inside the top six going into this weekend despite consecutive defeats to Derby and Hull. This does feel like a pivotal spell of the season for their promotion hopes; after Boro comes another trip to a team eyeing an automatic return to the Premier League in Ipswich.",
      "",
      "Still an absurd amount of life left in the Serie A title race, where Inter now appear solid favourites but Roma down in fourth are still only seven points adrift and not without their chances.",
      "They surely can’t afford to slip 10 points off Inter’s pace and also fall seven points adrift of Milan this weekend, though. Victory over the team in second would lift them within a single point of Milan, which itself seems an oddity given Milan have lost one league game all season while Roma have already lost seven.",
      "What Roma simply refuse to do at all, you see, is draw. Milan love a draw, so let’s see how this pans out.",
      "",
      "A clash between the two recent powerhouses of English women’s football that neither can afford to lose.",
      "Chelsea cannot afford to let a flying Man City get any further away from them, while for third-placed Arsenal the concern now is more behind them than in front. Spurs are level on points with them, and Man United only a point further back in what appears to be a three-horse race for the final Champions League spot.",
      "With Spurs facing bottom-of-the-table Liverpool this weekend and United doing so next weekend, Arsenal could do really do with a result this weekend to keep them at bay.",
      "Paul Scholes will be neither apologising nor shutting up about Lisandro Martinez, while Manchester United have ‘revealed’ a four-man midfielder shortlist.",
      "Michael Carrick loves his DNA but probably won’t be bringing back a Manchester United tactic which ‘broke Arsenal’ for a few fairly obvious reasons.",
      "Mikel Arteta has meticulously removed three monkeys from his back this season – and has an unexpected shot at another when Arsenal face Manchester United.",
      "We know Oliver Glasner will leave Crystal Palace at the end of the season (or sooner) but who is set to take over?",
      "Are Liverpool about to sack Arne Slot? They actually really might be after a run of drab Premier League draws. And now Xabi Alonso is available…",

      "Signed from Real Madrid for over £60million in August 2022, Casemiro penned a four-year contract, with the option of an additional year, worth more than £300,000 per week.",
      "At the time, the Erik ten Hag signing was viewed as a solid one. Casemiro had established himself as one of the best defensive midfielders in the world at Madrid, where he won five Champions League titles.",
      "However, signing a 30-year-old for such a monumental fee, on such high wages, for a minimum of four years, was always a financial risk and not a particularly wise one.",

      "The Real Madrid legend thrived in Amorim’s 3-4-2-1 system and has remained a key player since Michael Carrick took charge for the remainder of his United career.",
      "With just over four months left at Old Trafford, Casemiro has no silverware left to play for but will hope to help guide the club back into the Champions League.",

The offer being prepared in Riyadh surpasses any known standard, both in salary and media impact.",
      "‘Al Hilal wants Bruno to be the face of their international project, a symbolic signing that would reinforce the Saudi league’s image as a destination for established stars. For the Portuguese player, the offer would be virtually impossible to refuse from a financial standpoint, placing him among a select few footballers in history.’",
      "It is also said that the final decision regarding Fernandes hinges on three ‘factors’; ‘the sporting project presented by Manchester United, Bayern Munich’s ability to entice him with their competitive offerings, and, above all, the size of the Saudi Arabian offer’.",

Without Fernandes, United suddenly get a lot worse but also far less interesting. They will need a replacement ready to come in and light up Old Trafford and Palmer is one of very few we would fancy to thrive in that spotlight.",
      "That being true, why would Chelsea sell?",
      "Because Chelsea are Chelsea. They chase trades as hard as trophies. Arguably, football is the side hustle to Clearlake’s investment portfolio.",

      "Selling Palmer might spare the new manager a tricky decision. Because Chelsea can cope without Palmer far better than United without Fernandes.",
      "Does Palmer even get in Rosenior’s best team right now? Ludicrous question though it may seem, in the new manager’s preferred shape, there is room for only one attacking midfielder ahead of a double-pivot. Which pits Palmer against Enzo Fernandes for the no.10 position.",
      "Palmer has played off the right flank for Chelsea but, unquestionably, he is best used centrally. The same is true, though, of the Blues’ £107million Argentinian investment. And Rosenior is unlikely to grant Palmer the freedom to roam off the right that Mauricio Pochettino afforded him in 2023/24.",
      "Not only could United offer Palmer his Manchester home comforts – assuming that is as relevant as some are suggesting – but if Fernandes is not long for Old Trafford, the no.10 position would be his.",

      "The Premier League has gone a little bit sack crazy. Managergeddon is upon us and we are entirely here for the drama.",
      "Five clubs have changed manager since September. One has already done so twice, and another may very well be about to follow that path. If/when that happens Nuno Espirito Santo will have lost not one but two Premier League jobs within mere months of getting Nottingham Actual Forest into Europe.",
      "It is a wild ride and, at the top/bottom of this particularly vomit-inducing rollercoaster it now appears to be a straight fight between Nuno and the impossibly beleaguered Thomas Frank, among whose latest crimes is wandering around Bournemouth with a little Arsenal coffee cup in his hands and also losing to the aforementioned Nuno in El Sackico. And – this bit feels important – serving up some of the least watchable football on Premier League record. It is surely ‘when’ not ‘if’ territory there. But could someone else still beat Frank to the finish? Oliver Glasner and, even more interestingly, Pep Guardiola are now very much involved in the conversation.",
      "Frank, of course, only moved to Spurs in the summer to replace Ange Postecoglou who has already been hired and sacked by Nottingham Forest since then, while the true lay of the land at big clubs is laid bare by the fact two of the Big Six have binned off managers not for unacceptable results on the pitch but for unacceptable failure to acknowledge infallible wisdom and brilliance of their boardroom superiors. It is immensely modern football and there is almost zero chance we’ve seen the last of the managergeddon for the season. Not by a long chalk.",
      "Meanwhile, here are possible replacement managers currently between jobs, any one of whom really could, if they’re not careful, accidentally end up manager of Tottenham before the season is out.",
      "Rankings based on the latest best prices available at Oddschecker.com…",
      "",
      "An earlier version of this oft-updated piece speculated on what might happen to Mikel Arteta should Arsenal suffer from their Nightmare Start. What if they lost a few early games? What then? We concluded this:",
      "It’s far likelier that Arsenal emerge blinking into the autumn sunshine broadly unscathed from their nightmare horrors. No denying that this season does represent one in which Arteta might completely lose the plot and go entirely off the rails. Or the one where he wins the league by 10 points. Feels like we’re odds-on to get one or the other.",
      "Arsenal emerged duly unscathed, and cashed in on the shift to easier fixtures of their own alongside much tougher ones for Liverpool to take top spot and control in the Premier League.",
      "Only question that remains, therefore, is what Arsenal do from here. We are absolutely certain that it either involves p*ssing the league by 10 points or a complete and total meltdown. Nothing in between is acceptable or even conceivable. Both options now appear gloriously possible, but current forecasts clearly point more to the former.",
      "READ: Who will be the next manager of Arsenal if Mikel Arteta is sacked?",
      "",
      "Doing so well that even suffering the ultimate embarrassment of defeat at Old Trafford hasn’t dampened spirits for the most impressive promoted club in quite some time.",
      "Eight wins in the bag already and more points than any of the promoted-relegated teams managed in the entirety of 24/25. Widespread expectation that tougher games would bring Sunderland back down with a bump have thus far proved wide of the mark; there won’t be many teams unhappy at taking four points from two games against Chelsea and Arsenal this season. The comeback victory over Bournemouth was evidence, if indeed it was still required, that Sunderland are proper, as was beating beleaguered Palace at home.",
      "Success against Newcastle on derby day has us firmly into ‘manager of the year’ territory for one of the big pre-season Sack Race favourites.",
      "",
      "Extraordinary season for Emery already. Began the campaign right at the outside of this market with your Artetas and – unlikely as it now sounds – Slots. Then jumped right up to third favourite when Villa’s rankling disappointment at how last season ended leaked into a six-match winless start to this campaign.",
      "But then along came four Premier League wins in a row to thoroughly lift the mood at a club where a few short weeks earlier it really did feel like they’d come to the end of something special without ever getting the definitive moment of success it deserved.",
      "That run reached 12 wins in 13 Premier League games to lift Villa right through the mid-table slop, then into the top four, and then genuine title contention. And for the first 45 minutes at the Emirates it really did look like they might stick around for much longer.",
      "They didn’t and haven’t. But let’s not pretend that ‘slipping out of likely title contention’ is some kind of catastrophe for Villa. However disappointing that second half collapse was, they ended 2025 in a stunning place.",
      "Five wins in six games have a distinctly winnable Europa League campaign bubbling along nicely, too. An astonishing shift from what felt like an inexorable downward spiral not that long ago.",
      "We could all learn something from that, but we won’t.",
      "",
      "The continuity candidate in the summer, and looked to have received the ultimate hospital pass. How much continuity could there be at Brentford given they’d sold Bryan Mbeumo, Yoane Wissa and Christian Norgaard, while Thomas Frank took most of the remaining coaching staff with him to Tottenham? It was a very Brentford move to promote from within and we’ll hold our hands up and admit we thought it would go far, far worse than it has.",
      "With Newcastle and Sunderland added to Liverpool and Manchester United on the list of Gtech victims this season, it’s an undeniably impressive effort in trying circumstances, lifting Brentford all the way for now into what is very likely a Champions League-qualifying position.",
      "That Brentford now sit a whole six points clear of their former manager and his supposedly greener pastures is quite something.",
      "",
      "Fine end to 24/25 put a different complexion on Brighton’s season than at one time appeared likely. Ending up a clear best of the rest outside the quickly established top seven represented at least a passing grade and they’d have had to make a truly awful start to the season to get in any kind of managerial-change bother.",
      "The win over Newcastle to go with victory at Chelsea to go with a win over City reaffirmed Brighton’s big-boy-bothering calibre, but does also make some of their other results – draws with Fulham and Spurs (from 2-0 up) and Wolves and West Ham (twice), for instance – a bit annoying.",
      "We still subscribe to the view that every team between seventh and 14th is equally good/bad and that no major judgement for good or bad should be based on whichever arbitrary position has been handed to them this week.",
      "",
      "Backed in to a hot favourite as the whispers began before the international break. But just when we thought it might be time to accept something is fundamentally broken here as a relegation fight bubbled up, an impressive win over Sunderland and a restorative visit to Tottenham have sorted things out.",
      "Six wins and two draws in 11 Premier League games since the November international break have lifted Fulham well away from the relegation battle and into the mid-table strivers, significantly lessening the real risk that either Silva or Fulham might do something they live to regret.",
      "",
      "The hard-nosed yet valid argument persists that Leeds could and perhaps should have taken drastic action in the summer even after their very good week. It would have made Spurs’ decision to sack Europa League-winning Ange Postecoglou look positively kind, Leeds – and Burnley for that matter – might now be better off had they thanked the managers who secured 100 Championship points and got them back into the big time and then sent them on their way.",
      "Farke had a dreadful Premier League record of only six wins and 26 points from his 49 games in charge of Norwich, a team he twice led to promotion from the Championship with 94 and 97 points.",
      "As well as fighting his own record in this competition, Farke faced the added burden of expectation levels very different to those at just about any other club that could possibly find itself promoted into the Premier League in this current era where that represents the most bittersweet of successes.",
      "Defeat at Burnley was honking, but bouncing back to win another six-pointer against West Ham eased the stress significantly before a paddling at Brighton and events elsewhere – including West Ham themselves – left Farke desperately short of immediate cover before a desperately poor show in a six-pointer at Nottingham Forest.",
      "Another painful defeat having gone in front, against Villa this time, saw Leeds drop into the bottom three ahead of a brutal run of games, but that run has gone surprisingly well. The narrow loss to Man City preceded a rare home win against Chelsea and comeback draw against Liverpool.",
      "The question now is whether Leeds and Farke have really hit on something sustainable, or this is merely delaying the inevitable. After the 4-1 win against Crystal Palace and a very decent point at Sunderland, it really does start to look like it might be the latter which has enormous repercussions for both Farke and several other names around him on this list.",
      "Enormously impressive even in heartbreaking defeat at Newcastle in a wild 4-3 that earned instant classic status. Key now is to ensure that it doesn’t throw them off course, because once the initial pain subsides there is no reason why it should.",
      "",
      "A 4-1 thumping of Everton followed a simply huge and wildly unexpected win over Manchester City. Had Newcastle lost that, as all pre-interlull indications suggested they would, then the spotlight would have been harsh indeed on Howe and his team. They would at that point find themselves slap bang in the muck of a relegation scrap; instead they have lifted themselves back into the mid-table morass and – with absolutely nobody in there being actually any good at all – have now managed to get themselves right to the very top of it, firmly back into the Champions League equation, via nothing more complicated than three straight wins.",
      "The 4-3 victory over Leeds was admittedly quite complicated, but also just tremendously exciting. Pure Newcastle heritage. The drab 0-0 at Wolves, not so much.",
      "",
      "Sounds preposterous, but there really is a non-zero chance Moyes gets punished for easing Everton’s immediate relegation fears and they seek some more enterprising football from a squad that is, in fairness, capable of that as climbing into the top six demonstrates. Does feel like a very familiar Everton story, though, and one that ends with them 16th, chastened, and bringing in another firefighter.",
      "",
      "Still among the least sackable managers in the top flight despite Bournemouth now being in the depths of one of the familiar lows that have always existed alongside the highs under Iraola.",
      "A streaky manager of a streaky team, but he must still be in credit overall given the prognostications of doom when he had to sell pretty much his entire defence in the summer. It’s hurting him and Bournemouth now but they still – for now, just about – remain outside the real relegation scrap and that’s impressive enough on the back of such a challenging summer.",
      "But after an 11-game run without a win, he and Bournemouth desperately needed something to kickstart another of those runs of Champions League form. And sure enough, along came Dr Tottenham with the prescription, and Antoine Semenyo with a wonderful parting gift.",
      "",
      "Instantly unseated Eddie Howe and Thomas Frank at the top of the list of Premier League managers to sound most like a High Performance Podcast guest with that absurd cack about ageing men.",
      "This is Chelsea, so he absolutely could be gone before the end of the season. But this is managergeddon, and there’s almost no chance at least one other poor sod doesn’t go first. Which is for the best. We’d hate to think of Rosenior being forced out of Chelsea before he’s had any real chance to age any men at all.",
      "",
      "Might actually have made Wolves… quite good? Certainly a lot less bad, anyway. It is still almost certainly too little, too late, but that’s also not really Rob Edwards’ fault either.",
      "The first win of the season was a cathartic dismantling of a doom-laden West Ham, and it didn’t come out of a clear blue sky either. There had been signs of life even in defeat at Arsenal and Liverpool, before running away giggling from Old Trafford with a point.",
      "After a draw at Everton and another at home to Newcastle, it’s now six points from their last four games. That’s a pretty big deal when you’ve only managed two from the previous 18 games.",
      "Stranger things have happened, but admittedly not many. And most of them in the actual Stranger Things. On balance, Wolves would also probably rather believe in a wild conspiracy theory that suggests this current season has actually been entirely fake and that the real ending is yet to be revealed.",
      "",
      "Has done more than could ever have been expected given the chaos he walked into. That epic pants-pulling at Anfield and joyful spangling of Tottenham should be enough to buy any manager coming into a relegation-haunted club serious time.",
      "But Mr Marinakis’ lair is never a safe place for any manager to lurk, and there have been a pair of honking defeats against Everton and a weirdly rubbish performance against Brighton as well that will have had one of 2025’s key supervillains twitching over his big red sack button once more.",
      "Looked in very serious trouble when trailing at half-time against West Ham; Forest’s first win in a Premier League game they’d been losing at half-time since 1997 was enormously well timed. Going out of the FA Cup at Wrexham not so much.",
      "",
      "Decision time for Burnley. There are two options available, and they prompt inevitable questions.",
      "Option one: Burnley decide to really try and beat relegation, and must decide whether they think Parker is the best man for that job.",
      "Option two: Burnley accept their overwhelmingly likely fate, and must decide whether Parker the best man to get them back up again.",
      "Parker’s job prospects likely rest on the decision. Because if it is indeed option two, he has a compelling case. Option one? He’s f*cked.",
      "But the longer he remains in place, the greater the chance that option two is the one. And right now he’s doing just enough to keep the wolves (literal and figurative) from the door.",
      "",
      "Impossible to avoid the conclusion that Slot’s reaction to Liverpool’s mini-crisis becoming actual-crisis was poor. He went Full Klopp with his salty loser behaviour when Manchester United committed the crime of altering their tactics to give themselves the best chance of success against Liverpool, and the headloss continued after another chaotic and unstructured performance led to a 3-2 defeat at Brentford.",
      "Having ticked ‘opposition doing tactics wrong’ off his rattled manager bingo card, he can now add ‘losing his mind over entirely uncontroversial refereeing decisions’ with his response to both the Cody Gakpo non-penalty and Virgil van Dijk penalty at the Gtech.",
      "It has to be a worry for Liverpool that Slot has for the first time in his Anfield career found himself under any kind of pressure after a chastening run of defeats, and suffered severe and instant headloss as a result.",
      "Funny to think of a manager who’s beaten Real Madrid in the Champions League being under threat, but defeat at the Etihad was miserable before Nottingham Forest came along and achieved the amusing feat of being the first team to shut Liverpool out in the Premier League at Anfield since Nottingham Forest.",
      "And then there was a new nadir against PSV. That really was very, very bad. West Ham were wonderfully welcoming hosts on Sunday, but to such an inexplicable extent that it’s hard to know just how much to read into Liverpool’s 2-0 win at the London Stadium against opponents who were barely there. Predictably, they were poor in a 1-1 against proper team Sunderland and showed no backbone in the collapse at Leeds United, which was then followed by a distinctly unwelcome MO SALAH BOMBSHELL that does leave things looking distinctly like either he or the manager will have to go.",
      "A run of four consecutive wins cooled the immediate temperatures, but it all felt extremely precarious. The wins over Spurs and Wolves lacked any real authority. And then there were careless draws against Leeds and Fulham.",
      "There was another draw at Arsenal, though this was comfortably the most promising of their most recent stalemates. Still, this has not stopped Liverpool from coming up with a ‘contingency plan’, which might be enacted after drawing at home to Burnley in what is fast becoming the world’s least convincing unbeaten run ever.",
      "",
      "It’s been quite a year for Nuno. He ended 2024 as our manager of the year; he ended 2025 looking in imminent danger of his second sacking of the season.",
      "Seven points from three games against Newcastle, Burnley and Bournemouth left things looking far comfier than might have been expected for a manager who, when the Magpies took an early lead at the London Stadium, looked to be heading for a second sack of the season long before the Christmas decorations went up.",
      "But quite why Nuno had to be so very Nuno in the way he, on the back of 3-1 and 3-2 wins and a 2-2 draw, decided to approach a home game against a Liverpool team that had just suffered three consecutive three-goal defeats, is puzzling, irritating and, above all, a reminder that he is here as a firefighter and that the marriage to a fanbase with limited patience for drab and functional let’s-not-get-relegated football is merely one of convenience.",
      "Especially as we still await truly compelling evidence that this football won’t, in fact get them relegated. They are in the bottom three and a long, long way adrift of safety after a rotten defeat to Nottingham Forest, who sit just the other side of the trapdoor but still five points away despite West Ham collecting the inevitable from a trip to Dr Tottenham.",
      "",
      "A sacking remains out of the question despite continued (relative) struggles. There hasn’t been a Premier League manager since Fergie in his pomp with more credit in the bank than Pep.",
      "But is there still a distinct chance Guardiola decides he’s had enough and simply walks away? We reckon there is as they eye ‘two’ alternatives, and it’s always worth remembering that we’re talking Next Premier League Manager To Leave here, and that the traditional ‘Sack Race’ shorthand is a bit misleading.",
      "If, as now seems likely, City are unable to muster a meaningful challenge to Arsenal at the summit, it’s not impossible to imagine a scenario where Champions League failure prompts Guardiola to sod it all for a game of soldiers. Crucially, though, there is still almost no chance of any of that coming to pass before at least one of the genuine misery-guts clubs pressing the panic button.",
      "",
      "Definitely leaving at the end of the season, and very probably before that given the extent to which this relationship now appears to be breaking down.",
      "He’s currently among the names being considered by Manchester United for the permanent manager’s job that is set to be available this summer. And that’s before we mention Liverpool and Spurs. He really does deserve a crack at a big job; it’s just a shame really that they are all, in their way, so very silly.",
      "Also does need stating, for the record, that Palace are currently quite sh*t. They are without a win in ten games – a run that even includes airily dismissing the help of Dr Tottenham – and have achieved an FA Cup first as a top-flight side in managing to be eliminated by a sixth-tier one. This is all either very bad or very clever timing, depending on how you view the desirability of those various Big Six options.",
      "The prospect of Glasner walking long before his contract expires sounds very real.",
      "",
      "",
      "",
      "There have been good days and bad – losing at home to West Ham felt like the latter – and our whole pondering of Frank’s situation at Spurs has been about determining which of the two would eventually win out. The harrowing NLD-PSG-Fulham week was the first time he really did look f*cked.",
      "Spurs were timid and abysmal in the North London Derby, the second big London derby in a row which Frank had approached more in the manner of a League One manager attempting to avoid a paddling in the FA Cup third round than a legitimate rival facing a familiar foe.",
      "There was some encouragement in a 5-3 Champions League defeat at PSG, but even the very fact it’s possible to write the words ‘some encouragement in a 5-3 Champions League defeat’ is in its own way damning.",
      "But at least those two defeats came against what genuinely might be the two best teams in Europe at this time. With all due respect to Fulham and the sterling work of Marco Silva in recent years, they are not one of the two best teams in Europe at this time, and they were still much better than Spurs who torpedoed themselves inside the opening seven minutes to extend their extraordinarily – and in fairness largely pre-Frank – awful home record in the Premier League to three wins in 21 games since an increasingly odd-looking 4-1 win over Aston Villa in November last year.",
      "Frank’s response to the booing of Guglielmo Vicario after his hideous blunder was firmly in the ‘That’s true, but he shouldn’t say it’ category. And the way he went about it was all wrong.",
      "There should have been some acknowledgement that the booing of Vicario, unsavoury and unhelpful as it may have been, did not burst forth from a clear blue sky but instead a bubbling frustration from fans who pay among the highest ticket prices in the country to watch what is now among the worst and least effective football in the country.",
      "To instead label those supporters – and the boos did not come from a tiny minority inside the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium – not real Spurs fans was another gaffe that pushes the manager further towards the exit.",
      "Until that point we’d felt the obvious comparisons between Thomas Frank and Nuno Espirito Santo didn’t quite fit.",
      "But it’s certainly starting to look uncomfortably similar in familiar ways; the small-time approach to big games has not been well received and the fear grows that he just doesn’t understand what this job requires. The fact almost no manager in Premier League history has managed to understand what this job requires is cold comfort at this time.",
      "However, from there Spurs went to Newcastle and got a draw (albeit a ludicrous one) before they had a dominant 2-0 win against Frank’s old club Brentford, which everyone at Spurs sorely needed. It was easily their most convincing Premier League performance since the win at City on matchday two and a result that could have been even more compelling.",
      "They then pretty much secured a Champions League play-off round spot at the very least with a fine 3-0 win over Slavia Prague.",
      "But Spurs are Spurs, so they followed that with the worst performance yet of Frank’s reign in a truly inept and miserable 3-0 defeat at Nottingham Forest.",
      "Bringing Joao Palhinha and Ben Davies on to try and hold on to a 2-0 defeat and not even managing that feels uncomfortably like the infamous Nuno Moment against Manchester United.",
      "Have reached the kind of state where a dreadful home defeat to a very poor Liverpool is being dressed up as ‘signs of encouragement’. In reality, it might have been the worst possible result; still a defeat, yet one that risks extending the increasingly obviously doomed reign of the latest manager to be chewed up and spat out by the country’s most preposterous football club.",
      "The win at Palace was welcome if deeply unconvincing, while the sheer small-timery of a mind-meltingly dull goalless draw at Brentford really might have hurt Frank more than any of the many, many defeats. Or at least we thought that before they somehow contrived to Dr Tottenham their way to a 3-2 defeat at a Bournemouth side on a horrific streak while Frank was holding an Arsenal-branded cup.",
      "That and the fact the winning goal was scored by Antoine Semenyo with his last kick for Bournemouth before toddling off to pass the next two years on Man City’s bench were just the latest reminders that Spurs are a club where ridiculous things happen routinely, and that Frank simply isn’t and never will be capable of dealing with that.",
      "And in a strange way, that’s to his credit. It does look like Spurs are determined to try and muddle through the season with the obviously doomed Frank at the wheel, and in an odd way his immediate future might have more to do with West Ham than Spurs. It really might take further signs of life from across the capital and genuine, mortal danger of relegation to rouse the Spurs suits from their current slumbers. Although Cristian Romero has had a go there too.",

      "After the latest check on the pulse of the nation with regard to Mason Greenwood’s return to Manchester United, we can confirm that people remain grimly fascinated by the possibility and that it’s still really not OK.",
      "It’s an uncomfortable truth that football journalists are now all too aware of that Greenwood is a name which does good business. In part because he’s an excellent footballer who looks destined for great(er) things, but also because of the manner of his exit from Old Trafford and how his possible return continues to split opinion.",
      "Greenwood faced charges for rape and assault in October 2022 but the Crown Prosecution Service discontinued the case against him four months later after the withdrawal of key witnesses significantly reduced the chances of a conviction. He was not – as Greenwood said in a statement afterwards – “cleared” of the charges. We all heard the audio.",
      "Manchester United tested the waters. They gave inside scoops detailing his reintegration into the squad and were met with disgust from fans and (some) members of the media.",
      "In a lengthy statement, Female Fans Against Greenwood’s Return said the possible return of Greenwood “tells us, as women, that we don’t matter”.",
      "It added: “It tells us that men who make the club money matter; not us, our fellow fans, mothers, sisters or daughters.”",
      "To avoid a PR disaster, Greenwood was sent to Getafe on a season-long loan, before – after further suggestions that he may return to Man Utd were shot down – he was sold to Marseille for £26m in the summer of 2024.",
      "And now 42 goals in 63 appearances for the Ligue 1 side, links to Barcelona and Premier League alternatives, and sell-on and buy-back clauses combine to make his future a particularly intriguing prospect for click-hungry websites. We’re aware that we’re having and eating cake.",
      "Thursday morning saw multiple old Greenwood articles re-nosed for publication. What’s ‘Tuchel’s stance on an England recall’? Still a hard no. We particularly enjoyed Jurgen Klopp ‘making his feelings clear on Greenwood’ as one outlet looked to crowbar two of the most Google-able names into the same headline.",
      "The flurry was no coincidence. Editors will have been on at their minions to push Greenwood on the back of him facing Liverpool for Marseille last night, sensing an opportunity for traffic with him front of mind for more English fans than usual. They will have been praying for a goal or two from the 24-year-old to provide a further boost.",
      "One report claims ‘Man United officials have internally discussed the idea of bringing Mason Greenwood back to the club’. Who says? ‘Sources’ do. Could be groundsman No. 5 or – because it’s not ‘club sources’, just ‘sources’ – literally anyone. I’m a source, you’re a source.",
      "That’s preferential on a moral level than if the ‘news’ has come from inside Manchester United, as that would suggest that they are again looking to gauge public opinion over his possible return. Newsflash guys: it’s never going to change.",
      "People who believe he deserves a second chance and that everyone makes mistakes, who sign up to the view that ‘she’s OK with it so why aren’t you?’ left their morals at the door long ago and aren’t about to recover them.",
      "Those of us who see the preservation of his career as a stain on football and want the verified social media accounts championing him to get in the bin aren’t about to forgive and forget on the basis of him scoring quite a lot of goals.",
      "Just to be clear: It will never be okay for Manchester United to re-sign Mason Greenwood.",
      "Saudi Pro League side Al-Hilal have reportedly made an offer to sign Marseille striker Mason Greenwood amid rumours he could return to Man Utd.",

      "There are a couple of league tables that feel pretty significant this morning.",
      "The first is a Champions League table that has five Premier League teams camped inside the all-important top eight, and a non-zero chance that after the matchday-eight madness that number is actually six.",
      "And then there’s the newly published Deloitte Football Money League that has every member of the Premier League’s Big Six inside its top 10, with only the continental behemoths of Real Madrid, Barcelona, Bayern Munich and Paris Saint-Germain ahead.",
      "Perhaps more striking still is that three more Premier League sides – Aston Villa, Newcastle and West Ham – all make the top 20. And it only gets more absurd the further down the list you go; half the top 30 are Premier League teams. Brentford had higher revenues in 24/25 than any South American club.",
      "It’s a reminder, along with the recent domestic struggles of your Tottenhams and Manchester Uniteds in an increasingly competitive division, of just how huge the Premier League’s baked-in advantage over the rest of Europe and therefore the world now is.",
      "There is no other country that could even conceive of having six teams cruising through the Champions League league stage as the English clubs have this season. A quick look at the worst-performing team from the other big leagues – none of whom, of course, have as many as six entrants to begin with – is stark.",
      "Villarreal sit second bottom with just a point to their name after seven games. Eintracht Frankfurt have fared little better and are also out of contention altogether before the final matchday of a league format specifically and deliberately designed to minimise jeopardy. Napoli currently sit outside the top 24.",
      "And even above them, any or all of Marseille, Leverkusen, Monaco and Athletic Club could yet tumble and miss even the play-off safety net.",
      "England’s worst-performing team is Manchester City, who even in the absolute worst-case scenario can now finish no lower than 18th.",
      "And this at a time when five of the Big Six would consider themselves to be, in general, underperforming this season. Even not in peak condition, these six teams remain among the very best in the Champions League, their superiority baked in yet further by the added advantage of being kept apart from each other throughout the league phase. Five Champions League places already feels inevitable for next season.",
      "Tottenham are the 14th best team in England but the fifth best in the entire continent. You’re tempted to say ‘make it make sense’ but it’s actually pretty depressingly easy to make it make sense. The bloated Champions League league stage is a lower overall standard than the Premier League.",
      "The only real surprise in Spurs’ lofty standing is the fact three Premier League teams sit below them.",
      "You could chuck plenty more Premier League teams into the Champions League and they would most likely also finish in the top 24 qualifying positions.",
      "Aston Villa and Manchester United most obviously, but really anyone currently above Spurs in the table has proof of concept.",
      "There are other factors of course. There’s little doubt that Spurs specifically are playing with far greater freedom with the pressure off to an extent in a Champions League where relatively little is expected of them and failure is legitimately hard to achieve; they are clearly less burdened and shackled by fear and tension on European nights at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, where they haven’t lost any of their last 24 games, than on Premier League days.",
      "The fact Spurs have won as many Champions League games as Premier League games on their own patch since the start of 2025 is both hilarious and ridiculous, but also revealing.",
      "English clubs, in truth, underperformed in last season’s Champions League. Yet they still produced a semi-finalist, a quarter-finalist and a team that dominated the league stage only to find themselves unfortunate to come up against what was by the time of the first knockout round the best team in the competition.",
      "And it still took members of the tiny handful of European powerhouses who can still vaguely compete with any of the Premier League big guns on an even keel to eliminate them: Real Madrid knocked out Man City, and PSG took care of Liverpool, Aston Villa and Arsenal – notably finding each of them far harder nuts to crack than finalists Inter.",
      "And the three members of the Premier League’s Big Six who found themselves outside the Big Cup just casually dominated the lesser trophies, with Spurs beating Man United in the Europa League final and Chelsea winning the Conference League while yawning and absent-mindedly scratching their arse throughout.",
      "But the Deloitte numbers also show why, even now as it feels like it’s disintegrating on the Premier League pitch, it is still correct to talk about the Big Six. Spurs’ revenues still dwarf those of Villa and Newcastle, never mind supposed European giants like Atletico Madrid or Juve or the Milan clubs.",
      "The fact Villa’s wage bill is significantly higher than Tottenham’s – and terrifyingly close to Manchester United’s – is a sign of a problem approaching rapidly over the hill for the midlands club rather than evidence they have compellingly displaced silly Spurs.",
      "And here too another reminder that while Villa’s frustration and anger at what they perceive as rules designed to protect that Big Six and force them to operate with one hand behind their back is understandable, their direction for that irritation is entirely misplaced.",
      "Villa should not look at Spurs and think ‘unfair’. They should look at Spurs as the example to follow. Not on the pitch, obviously. Don’t do that, whatever you do. But off the pitch.",
      "For all their myriad faults, their undeniable and unending banter-club status, the one thing Spurs have got impressively right over the last two decades is making that elite cabal a Big Six in the first place, and how they went about it. Say what you like about Spurs – and we do, frequently – but they did not bet the house on shortcutting their way in as Villa are currently attempting or follow Newcastle’s own dubious attempt at the Man City or Chelsea approach.",
      "And that’s why even now, as Spurs reel around on the fringes of a genuine relegation fight and Villa have at this time thoroughly and conspicuously overtaken them on the pitch, those Deloitte numbers and Champions League table still tell a tale of how and why the idea of the Big Six persists and prevails."

      "With six English teams participating in this season’s Champions League, and the league stage reaching the Christmas break, it’s already worth having a look to see just how many Premier League teams might get a crack at the Big Cup again next season.",
      "There will once again be 36 rather than 32 teams in next season’s Champions League, and two of those extra places will once again be awarded to the leagues who have been deemed to have performed best in Europe this season.",
      "In six of the last eight seasons, England would have claimed one of those two spots. The first time it actually mattered, they didn’t; England trailed in behind Germany and Italy, with Newcastle and Man United’s pre-Christmas exits from Europe a key early factor before a series of disappointments across all three competitions in the knockout stages.",
      "It proved to be quite a significant sliding doors moment; had England secured a fifth spot that season it would have gone to Tottenham, who instead went off and won the Europa League.",
      "They are thus the sixth Premier League entrant this season, with Newcastle’s prize for finishing fifth upgraded to a Champions League spot with England – unsurprisingly – coming out miles ahead at the top of the overall rankings on the back of winning two of the three trophies as well as having a losing finalist and semi-finalist.",
      "And the whopping nine English teams in European competition this season have already made a strong start in the quest to secure another bonus spot next season.",
      "The system for working out the co-efficient rating that decides which leagues come out on top is (relatively) simple.",
      "Every win in Europe – whether Champions, Europa or Conference League – is worth two points to your country’s tally, and every draw one. There are then assorted bonus points to be awarded based on finishing positions in the bumper final league tables as well as further points for reaching different knockout rounds.",
      "All teams competing in the Champions League phase are awarded six points just for being there – a huge early boost to England’s tally with two thirds of their nine teams in that competition. You get an additional 0.25 points for finishing 24th in the final table, with an extra 0.25 points on offer for each position from there up. So 23rd gets 0.5, 22nd gets 0.75 and so on all the way up to six points for the table-toppers. The Europa League has no bonus points for competing, but again offers 0.25 points to the team that ends 24th and six to the team finishing first on the same sliding scale as the Champions League.",
      "Just to keep us all on our toes, it’s slightly different again in the Conference. Here you get 0.125 points for 24th, and an extra 0.125 points for each position up to ninth, and then 0.25 points for each extra position you can climb in the top eight.",
      "Long story short, the table-toppers in the Champions League get 12 points altogether, Europa League toppers six points, and Conference League four.",
      "Champions League teams then get an extra 1.5 points for each knockout round they participate in (last 16, quarter-final, semi-final, final), Europa League teams one point for each round, and Conference League teams 0.5 points. There are no bonus points on offer for reaching the playoff round that teams finishing between ninth and 24th in each competition have to deal with, but you do still get result points.",
      "So if you qualify for, say, the Champions League quarter-final by winning both legs of your last-16 clash, you collect 5.5 points for your country’s tally: two for each win and a bonus 1.5 points for reaching the next stage. If you get through with a win and a defeat it’s 3.5 points (two for a win, plus the qualification bonus). And so on.",
      "The total number of points accrued by all teams from a particular league are then divided by the total number of teams from that league who began the season in European competition to obtain an average rating that determines the all-important standings.",
      "This also therefore means individual match wins are worth more to the score for a country that had fewer teams involved to begin with; a win for any Portuguese side this season, for instance, is worth 0.400pts to the final tally because it is two points divided by the five teams they had in contention when the season began, while for England a two-point win is worth only 0.222pts to the total after it has been divided by nine.",
      "",
      "Could pay some price down the line when teams inevitably start being eliminated and those that are left see their points still being divided by nine, but England are streaking clear and creating a healthy buffer over their major rivals. The six bonus points awarded to each of the six Champions League teams are a huge help, but they are also picking up consistently solid results across all three competitions.",
      "All six of England’s Champions League representatives are now assured of play-off spots at worst. Arsenal will definitely finish in the top eight and go straight to the last 16, while it’s not inconceivable that all of the other five could do so. Remember, there are bonus points on offer based on your finishing positions and last-16 participation, so that will all help boost the pot.",
      "Villa and Forest are in good shape in the Europa League, while Crystal Palace are in the Conference League play-offs. England are going to be scooping up plenty more points for a good while yet. It would already be a huge shock if one of those extra Champions League places doesn’t once again come the Premier League’s way.",
      "Total points: 125.375\nTotal teams: Nine\nTeams still active: Nine\nPlay-off round: Crystal Palace (UECL)\nLeague stage: Liverpool (UCL), Arsenal (UCL), Manchester City (UCL), Chelsea (UCL), Newcastle (UCL), Tottenham (UCL), Aston Villa (UEL), Nottingham Forest (UEL)",
      "",
      "Yes, it’s a surprise name currently in second place until you scratch the surface. First, with only four teams in European competition every individual win is worth half a point. Add in the fact that all four of Poland’s teams are in the Conference, where the league stage is over and the bonus points for finishing positions dished out, and it all starts to make sense.",
      "Will obviously fall off as the stagger unwinds, but they will still be picking up points here and there for a while yet.",
      "Total points: 54.500\nTotal teams: Four\nTeams still active: Three\nLast 16: Rakow Częstochowa (UECL)\nPlay-off round: Lech Poznan, Jagiellonia Bialystok (both UECL)\nEliminated: Legia Warsaw (UECL)",
      "",

      "Finished second in the list last year to scoop an extra place and will be right in the mix again, but Villarreal are already out of contention in the Champions League, with Athletic Club also at risk of missing even the play-offs. But the big three will all be fine, as should all three of their Thursday night teams.",
      "To no great surprise, it looks like Spain in a scrap with Italy and Germany to pick up an extra spot alongside England.",

      "Adopting the opposite approach to Ruben Amorim, using Harry Maguire as a dressing-room influencer and ignoring loud-mouthed former players are among the keys to Michael Carrick’s nine-day revolution at Manchester United.",
      "The Red Devils couldn’t have got off to a better start on the pitch under the interim boss, as they tore Manchester City apart in a hugely impressive 2-0 victory on Saturday, in a display which drew parallels with the Sir Alex Ferguson era for the first time in a very long time at Old Trafford.",

      "And a report from Mirror has also detailed some of the changes Carrick has made behind the scenes to transform what was a downbeat mood under his predecessor.",
      "Upon interviewing Carrick, the report claims that both Joel and Avi Glazer, along with Sir Jim Ratcliffe, were ‘engrossed in the words which spilled from his lips’ before presumably going for a cold shower.",
      "He told them he was ‘invested in quality more than quantity’ in training and match preparation, insisting ‘being honest was just as valuable as having the ball at their feet on the training ground’. Club sources claim Ratcliffe was impressed with his “calm and intelligent demeanour” in those discussions.",
      "Recognising there would likely be a ‘step-up in enthusiasm and energy’ upon his arrival – a new-manager bounce – Carrick spoke to Steve Holland ahead of the first training session to ensure they ‘took full advantage of an improved mood’ before handing the assistant coach ‘free reign to plan and take sessions at Carrington’.",
      "According to the report, ‘the players have been impressed with the attention to detail’ in what have been ‘shorter and more intense’ sessions than they were used to under Amorim.",
      "Meanwhile, Maguire was enlisted to ‘make it clear to his teammates how United had re-hired someone with the club’s principles running through his blood’.",
      "Carrick has also encouraged the squad not to rush home after games as he ‘wants relationships to build and flourish’ and so that he can ‘see which ones work and which ones don’t’, while taking the time to speak to individual players, particularly those who feel they’re on the fringes of the squad.",
      "He’s also taking ‘the opposite attitude’ to Amorim when it comes to feedback. While the Portuguese boss would often send players home after games without talking to them, Carrick insists on ‘no-one leaving the home dressing room without feeling appreciated’.",
      "United will arrive for games later than they did under Amorim to avoid them ‘hanging around before kick-off’ and to ensure ‘his squad get the best greeting possible’ from the fans.",
      "The last week, while hugely positive in general for United, has also seen some toxic punditry – if we can even call it that – from Paul Scholes and Nicky Butt make headlines.",
      "Carrick has ‘refused to get involved’ and has ‘made it clear to his players and coaching staff that there are far more pressing – and important – problems to fix’.",

      "We reported how Tottenham’s CEO, Vinai Venkatesham, opened initial talks with the Dutch international’s camp over the summer. He views a new deal for the defender as a top priority.",
      "However, Spurs are also aware that given their current struggles, there is little chance of persuading van de Ven to sign, so those talks are not progressing at any sort of pace.",
      "Sources indicate that Liverpool are fully aware of Van de Ven’s situation at Tottenham and very much like the 24-year-old as a long‑term defensive solution.",
      "Manchester United, meanwhile, are keeping pace, having tracked the centre-back since his Wolfsburg days and viewing him as an ideal profile for their rebuild.",
      "Both clubs admire his blend of recovery pace, composure, and left‑sided balance – attributes that are increasingly rare and, as it turns out, extremely expensive.",
      "Want more breaking transfer lines from original sources? Add TEAMtalk as a preferred source on Google to your favourites list for news you can trust.",
      "Given the interest gathering around Van de Ven, we understand from sources with knowledge of the situation that Tottenham have slapped the £100million price tag on him.",
      "Should Van de Ven leave for £100million, he would become the most expensive defender in football history, surpassing the £80million United spent on Harry Maguire in 2019.",
      "Sources suggest Spurs are fully aware that such a valuation will deter most suitors, but with their season faltering and uncertainty creeping in, they know they cannot afford to look weak in the market.",
      "Tottenham remain hopeful they tie Van de Ven down to an even bigger, long‑term contract, rewarding him for his rapid rise and cementing him as a cornerstone of their future.",
      "But given the club’s current trajectory, insiders admit there is little chance the Dutchman will commit to fresh terms.",
      "That leaves Spurs in a precarious position: a prized asset attracting heavyweight attention, a player reluctant to extend, and a valuation designed to keep the vultures at bay – at least for now.",
      "Liverpool and United will continue to monitor the situation closely, but so will others and we are told Real Madrid and Bayern Munich are fully aware of the situation, too.",
      "Meanwhile, my colleague, Dean Jones, has reported that Tottenham are still planning to make a ‘major’ signing before this month’s transfer window closes – and they are focusing on bringing in a new winger.",
      "With Yan Diomande unavailable and Antoine Semenyo joining Manchester City, they have switched their attention to West Ham star Crysencio Summerville.",
      "In other news, manager Thomas Frank remains under intense scrutiny, despite Spurs’ 2-0 win over Borussia Dortmund in the Champions League on Tuesday.",
      "Behind the scenes, the club’s hierarchy are doing their due diligence on potential replacements. However, reports suggest that former United manager Ruben Amorim, who has been linked with the role, is not an option for Spurs.",

      "According to reports, Manchester United are ‘in talks’ over re-signing Mason Greenwood, while an update has emerged regarding Bruno Fernandes.",
      "Greenwood progressed through the ranks at Man Utd and was expected to be a key player for his boyhood club for most of his career.",
      "However, Man Utd had no choice but to offload Greenwood after he faced charges relating to attempted rape and assault.",
      "The Crown Prosecution Service eventually discontinued the case against Greenwood as the withdrawal of key witnesses significantly reduced the chances of a conviction.",
      "Man Utd also conducted an internal investigation into the matter and they faced a PR disaster by keeping Greenwood, who was sent on loan to La Liga side Getafe in the 2023 summer transfer window.",
      "READ: Ranking the 20 biggest PL summer transfers as Man Utd pair storm into top three",
      "Greenwood impressed on the pitch for Getafe and joined Marseille in the 2024 summer transfer window for around £26m.",
      "Man Utd sold Greenwood below his market value, but they have a couple of clauses in their favour, including a 50% sell-on clause and a potential buy-back clause.",
      "The 24-year-old has 42 goals and 12 assists in his 63 appearances for Marseille over the past 18 months and has been heavily linked with moves elsewhere, with Barcelona and Atletico Madrid among those linked with him.",
      "These possibilities would benefit Man Utd financially as they would stand to receive an extra £25m+ with their sell-on clause, but a new report from Football Insider claims they are ‘in talks’ over ‘bringing Greenwood back’ to the club.",
      "Man Utd chiefs should hang their heads in shame if there is any truth to this report and it would still be a PR nightmare if they or another English side sanctions his return to the Premier League.",
      "The report from Football Insider adds: ‘Man United officials have internally discussed the idea of bringing Mason Greenwood back to the club, sources have told Football Insider.",
      "‘The Red Devils included a buy-back clause when they sold the 24-year-old right winger to Marseille in the summer of 2024, where they can sign the attacker for a knockdown fee less than his worth in the current market.’",
      "This deal is surely unlikely, but Man Utd are far more likely to sign at least two midfielders in the summer and could sell captain Bruno Fernandes to raise funds for these moves.",
      "Fernandes has been heavily linked with a potential move to the Saudi Pro League over the past year, but a new report from ESPN claims the Red Devils are keen for him to remain at the club beyond this season.",
      "The report explains: ‘Manchester United are planning talks with captain Bruno Fernandes about his future ahead of the World Cup with club bosses poised to tell the midfielder they want to keep him at Old Trafford for at least one more year, sources have told ESPN.",
      "‘Fernandes came close to joining Al Hilal last summer and there is expected to be more interest in the Portugal international at the end of the current campaign. However, the club’s preference is to keep their captain in what will be another transitional summer with a new permanent manager set to arrive to replace Ruben Amorim.’",
      "Saudi Pro League side Al-Hilal have reportedly made an offer to sign Marseille striker Mason Greenwood amid rumours he could return to Man Utd.",
      "According to reports, Manchester United captain Bruno Fernandes could join Saudi Pro League side Al-Hilal in the coming months via a ‘historic offer’.",
      "Chelsea fans won’t like it, but selling Cole Palmer to Man Utd might make sense for Clearlake and co with the England star one of few fit to replace Bruno ...",
      "We can confirm that people remain grimly fascinated by Mason Greenwood’s possible return to Manchester United and that it’s still not OK.",

      "Transfer expert Fabrizio Romano has revealed that an “internal meeting” at Man Utd is planned for “this week” regarding transfers.",
      "“There will be an internal meeting at Manchester United at the beginning of this week involving Michael Carrick,” Romano said.",
      "“Carrick does not make the final decisions, but he will be involved in discussions after a very strong start, including winning the Manchester derby. United will decide whether to pursue an opportunity in January, possibly in midfield or attack, or to keep the current squad until the summer.",
      "“At the moment everything is very quiet and the big investments are expected in the summer with a permanent manager in place. In Italy, clubs like Roma and Juventus are waiting to see if United open the door for players such as Joshua Zirkzee, but for now United have not decided.”",
      "READ: Ranking the 20 biggest PL summer transfers as Man Utd pair storm into top three",

      "Neves retains a strong reputation after having a brilliant spell with Wolves in the Premier League and he could return to England this month.",
      "The 28-year-old is due to become a free agent in the summer, but Al-Hilal could let him leave this month so they get a fee for the centre-midfielder.",
      "A report from Spanish outlet Fichajes claims Man Utd have been given a free run at landing Neves as Real Madrid have ‘closed the door’ and ‘rejected’ the chance to sign him for a fee this month.",
      "Neves, meanwhile, ‘would accept a significant pay cut’ to seal a move to Man Utd, who are ‘accelerating’ for the signing.",
      "The report claims: ‘They have already submitted a formal offer. The proposal is around 20 million pounds, just under 23 million euros. A significant sum considering the player’s contract expires in six months.",
      "‘At Old Trafford, they see it as a market opportunity. They prefer to pay now and secure the signing rather than enter a summer bidding war. Furthermore, Rúben Neves himself would be willing to facilitate the transfer.’",
      "Man Utd have now made a final decision to keep Kobbie Mainoo at Old Trafford after getting “instant trust” from Michael Carrick, says Fabrizio Romano.",
      "According to reports, Manchester United have lodged a ‘formal offer’ as they look to sign former Wolves midfielder Ruben Neves from Al-Hilal.",
      "Man Utd are still keeping their options open over a potential midfield signing in January with Ruben Neves still a possibility, according to reports.",
      "Transfer hijacks are really fun and we need some to save this January window. Here’s how Liverpool and Manchester United could be forced into action…",
      "Man Utd are reportedly keen on signing Ruben Neves, who is available for £20m in a transfer that has the potential to be the signing of the year.",

      "Kobbie Mainoo has 18 months remaining on his Manchester United contract, plus the option of a further year; 20-year-old did not start a Premier League game this season under Ruben Amorim but was restored to the XI in Michael Carrick's first game",
      "By Rob Dorsett and Vik Varange",
      "Friday 23 January 2026 11:58, UK",
      "On the day when United confirmed that one key midfielder will leave Old Trafford, with the soon-to-be-34-year-old Casemiro departing at the end of this season, it can now be revealed they are keen to tie down another, much younger, midfielder with a vastly improved deal.",
      "It is understood there has been initial contact with Mainoo's representatives, with a plan to sit down and discuss the details of a new and improved contract - one which would see his wages brought more in line with his team-mates and his standing at the club.",
      "Having come through United's academy, Mainoo's salary is among the smallest of all the members of the first-team squad. But with the 20-year-old not part of former head coach Ruben Amorim's plans, and with 18 months remaining on his current deal - plus a further year option - it was not seen as a priority for the club to open fresh talks.",
      "Mainoo did not start a single Premier League match this season under Amorim but was selected at the first opportunity by new head coach Michael Carrick last weekend as he put in an impressive performance as United beat City 2-0 in the Manchester derby.",
      "\"It's a significant time.",
      "\"On the day Manchester United announce Casemiro will be leaving the club at the end of the season, the club want to tie down another, much younger player in Mainoo, who they see as a key player for the future.",
      "\"It's a significant change for Mainoo.",
      "\"Under previous coach Ruben Amorim, he didn't start a single game this season.",
      "\"There was also interest in him in Europe but Michael Carrick has come in and he starred in the win over Manchester City.",
      "\"Manchester United now feel that this is the right time, while they are putting their house in order, they want to tie down some of their younger players who are important to the club's future. Mainoo is at the heart of it.\"",
      "The Mainoo news comes as Casemiro will leave Manchester United at the end of the season, ending a four-year stay at Old Trafford.",
      "The decision also gives Casemiro clarity for the rest of the season as he also prepares to represent Brazil in the World Cup in the summer.",
      "As SSN previously reported in the autumn, Casemiro is one of the highest earners in the squad and it was unlikely United would renew his contract as the freed up wage capacity will allow more space for future investment/signings in the midfield area.",
      "Casemiro has had a renaissance at the club in the last 12 months. After being out of the team under Ruben Amorim initially, he was praised by Amorim for his willingness to fight for his place and has been a key part of the team since then - he started the Manchester derby under Michael Carrick in his first game as well.",
      "Looking ahead to the summer, Manchester United have an interest in the likes of Carlos Baleba, Elliot Anderson and Adam Wharton.",
      "\"It's very interesting because we knew Casemiro's contract was running out this summer.",
      "\"Harry Maguire is also someone to talk about because his contract also runs out this summer. No fresh talks have happened with him, either.",
      "\"But especially with Casimiro, he is one of the highest earners at the club, and with that freed up wage space, we've been reporting in not just this window how Manchester United are targeting the summer to reinforce their midfield.",
      "\"We've already talked about the likes of Adam Wharton at Crystal Palace, Carlos Baleba at Brighton, Elliot Anderson and Nottingham Forest, to name a few.",
      "\"And through INEOS taking really control of the football operations, they've tried to change the way structures are streamlined a lot more.",
      "\"They're hoping that all of this capacity freed up can allow for more signings in the future, and with the midfield as a priority, it will mean that they definitely have to now sign someone in the summer.",
      "\"They'll only have Manuel Ugarte, Kobbie Mainoo, who looks like a new player under Michael Carrick, based on the Manchester derby.",
      "\"But Bruno Fernandes, now moving to No 10, they won't have many options in that position. INEOS will have to act quickly.\"",

      "🔴 Jesus over Gyokeres for Arsenal?💪 Miley's versatility for Newcastle🔍 A player to watch this weekend",
      "Gabriel Jesus and Viktor Gyokeres were seen to have given Mikel Arteta a selection dilemma against Manchester United in Arsenal's win over Inter Milan. But what if their goalscoring displays actually proved their suitability to their roles on the night?",
      "Arsenal looked a far more fluid attacking force with Jesus starting up front. The flurry of passes that led to their opening goal was untypical of Mikel Arteta's side this season and included a deft lay-off from Jesus to Mikel Merino before his instinctive finish.",
      "Jesus continued to knit things together, pulling to the flanks to combine with Arsenal's wide players, creating space for Eberechi Eze, feeding team-mates with his back to goal and, at one point, even driving forward with the ball and playing Bukayo Saka through.",
      "His performance, on only his third start this season, was reminiscent of the electrifying displays that followed his arrival from Manchester City in 2022, before the first in a succession of injuries struck.",
      "There was a set-piece goal too, of course, as he nodded his second over the line from a corner. But it was in open play that his impact was most apparent. Arsenal looked a different proposition thanks to their striker's imagination and technical security.",
      "They are qualities Gyokeres lacks. But by coming into the game as a substitute, when Inter were chasing an equaliser, he was able to show what he can do, attacking space on the break to latch onto Gabriel Martinelli's ball in behind before finishing superbly.",
      "It was a goal Jesus probably wouldn't have scored. Just as the opening goal by Jesus, with the intricate interplay that preceded it, was one Gyokeres probably wouldn't have scored.",
      "The first half of the season has exposed the limitations in Gyokeres's game. But it is also true that the conditions he found for his goal on Tuesday have rarely been available to him in the Premier League, where space is at a premium and compactness reigns.",
      "The moments when opponents become stretched tend to occur late in games, when they are tiring and, often, chasing goals. By that point, Gyokeres, who has started all but three of his 20 Premier League appearances so far, has usually been substituted.",
      "Arteta's hand has been forced, at least to some extent. Injuries to Jesus and Kai Havertz left Gyokeres as his only available striker for much of the season. But the option to change his role is there for the Arsenal manager now and the need for it is clear.",
      "Arsenal have won 13 out of 17 league games with Gyokeres starting but that is largely thanks to a reliance on set-pieces. They have only scored 13 open-play goals in those 17 games compared to 10 in the other five. There is a gap in open-play expected goals too.",
      "It is no coincidence that many of Arsenal's best and most fluent attacking performances this season, against Bayern Munich, Tottenham and now Inter Milan, have come when Arteta has started with either Mikel Merino or Jesus in the No 9 role over Gyokeres.",
      "Like Havertz, they bring more in the role. More touches, more passes, more duel-winning ability and, perhaps most damningly, more goals. Erling Haaland proves low-touch volume is not necessarily an issue for a striker. But only if that striker is scoring.",
      "Gyokeres, without a non-penalty Premier League goal since November 1, is simply not doing that. In his 17 starts up front in the competition, he has a worse shot conversion rate than any of the players with whom he is competing for the No 9 spot at Arsenal.",
      "All of which is not to say Gyokeres cannot be useful to Arteta. It might just require a recalibration of his role.",
      "At £64m, it is safe to assume he was not signed to be a substitute. But it is surely better to use him in the manner in which he can be most effective, as a relentless runner against tiring defences, than wait for him to become something he is not.",
      "Of course, the situation might look different had Havertz been available to share the minutes up front, instead of joining Jesus on the sidelines with a knee injury in August. A lighter workload, and more outings off the bench, might have suited Gyokeres better.",
      "It also would have made life easier for Arteta.",
      "Havertz's finishing has been a source of frustration to Arsenal supporters during his time at the club. But while the signing of Gyokeres was intended to add greater cutting edge, Havertz surely remains their first choice in the position when available.",
      "It is worth noting that at the time of the groin injury that curtailed his season last term, Havertz had scored 15 goals, putting him on track for the highest-scoring campaign of his club career.",
      "Across 31 Premier League starts as a forward for Arsenal overall, he has 24 goal involvements, with 15 goals and nine assists. And that is on top of everything else he brings to the role.",
      "They are hugely impressive numbers which underline the potential significance of a return to fitness which, frustratingly for Arsenal, is taking longer than expected. Havertz was an unused substitute against Nottingham Forest and Inter despite previously making cameos in the wins over Portsmouth and Chelsea.",
      "Jesus, of course, is still only recently returned from injury too.",
      "But if it is a choice between him or Gyokeres against Manchester United, events at the San Siro might have shown the way forward.",
      "The potential absence of Bruno Guimaraes against Aston Villa on Sunday following his injury against PSV Eindhoven is a worry for Newcastle. But in Lewis Miley they do at least have a player ready to step in and deliver whatever is asked of him.",
      "The 19-year-old ensured their captain was not missed in the second half of Wednesday's game. Having displayed maturity and composure in midfield, he ended up at right-back, taking the captain's armband off Kieran Trippier as he went off.",
      "It was a special moment for the academy product, who has been switching between positions all season. Having impressed as a makeshift right-back, he might now be needed back in midfield, where he has already slotted into a variety of different roles.",
      "Will Bryan Mbeumo be used as a No 9 again when Manchester United go to the Emirates Stadium on the back of their win in the Manchester derby? He can cause problems for the team against whom he made his United debut back in August.",
      "The last column made the case for Manchester United's new head coach Michael Carrick to go on the attack against Manchester City, something he did to great effect. There was also a look at Bruno Fernandes's return to No 10 and Antoine Semenyo's impact.",

      "Thursday 22 January 2026 22:40, UK",
      "Our football betting expert Jones Knows provides his insight across the Premier League weekend.",
      "Enzo Le Fée has quietly slipped under the radar of wider footballing circles but not the eyes of Sunderland supporters.",
      "Le Fée's season pivoted the moment he was moved into a more central role. Freed from the touchline and given licence to operate between the lines, his influence has surged. He's dictating tempo, demanding the ball and, most importantly for this bet, shooting more. The numbers back it up.",
      "Le Fée has scored in his last two matches and across that run has hit four shots on target.",
      "At 5/4 with Sky Bet to hit one or more shots on target the market still hasn't caught up with his positional shift or his growing assertiveness in the final third.",
      "A 1-1 draw with Liverpool doesn't mask the bigger picture for Burnley, which is damning. Across all the key underlying metrics, Burnley sit rock-bottom in the Premier League. Expected goals for, expected goals against, shots conceded, box entries allowed - it's a clean sweep of concern.",
      "Spurs' ceiling is miles higher than Burnley's. When they click, they can overwhelm teams. Tuesday's win over Borussia Dortmund was a reminder of what this side can look like when intensity meets quality. Aggressive pressing, fast ball movement and a very solid structure in defence.",
      "Playing away from home hasn't been a negative for Spurs this season - quite the opposite. They've already gone to Manchester City, Crystal Palace, Leeds and Everton and come back with wins. The idea that Turf Moor is an impenetrable fortress doesn't stack up against this Spurs profile.",
      "The Evens for an away win looks generous.",
      "We can get very caught up in just picking a side in the prediction game. Home win or away win. But sometimes the smartest bet is the one nobody wants to back - and Fulham vs Brighton has draw written all over it.",
      "Just one point separates these two in the Premier League. Both teams are capable of beating good sides on their day, but neither consistently dominates teams of a similar level. When Fulham and Brighton face opponents in this bracket, games tend to settle into long spells of balance.",
      "The draw is the biggest price of the three outcomes and it's the bet nobody wants to back. Punters gravitate towards winners. Bookmakers know that. So, draw prices often drift organically beyond where the true probability sits, especially in evenly matched fixtures like this. It can be backed here at 9/4 with Sky Bet.",
      "This is a fixture that automatically drags the goal line up. Manchester City at home, Wolves in town. The market instinctively leans towards a goal-heavy afternoon. But backing this Wolves defence under Rob Edwards has quietly become a profitable strategy. They're tighter, better organised, and far more disciplined without the ball. Over their last eight Premier League games, Wolves rank second best for expected goals against. That's elite defensive process.",
      "Then factor in Manchester City's week. Chaotic is the word. Distractions, noise, pressure and that often leads to pragmatism rather than expression. City don't need to win big here. Any win will do. Control, manage, move on.",
      "Yet, at 1/5 with Sky Bet they are a favourite worth swerving. Of those two win market options, I'd much rather back a Wolves win at 10/1.",
      "That opens up multiple paths for an under goals bet and it's the under 3.5 line at 4/5 with Sky Bet that stands out as the main play.",
      "Florian Wirtz's start to life in the Premier League has been a slow burn - but the signs are starting to show that we must start paying attention to him across the prop markets.",
      "The early weeks after his £116m summer move from Leverkusen were awkward. New league, new tempo, new expectations. All that jazz.",
      "Wirtz's end product has caught fire recently though. He's now averaging close to a goal involvement every 102 minutes across his last eight appearances in all competitions.",
      "After failing to score in his first 22 Liverpool appearances, he's now hit the net in four of his last seven. That's a player finding rhythm, timing and trust in his surroundings.",
      "He is 8/1 to open the scoring with Sky Bet.",
      "Some bets don't need overcomplicating. You look at the venue, you look at the numbers and the picture becomes clear. Brentford at home is one of those situations and the 10/11 with Sky Bet against Nottingham Forest is very hard to turn down.",
      "The Gtech has quietly become one of the toughest places to go in the Premier League. Brentford have taken 24 points from a possible 33 at home, the fourth-best home record in the division. That's not built on soft fixtures either, it's a repeatable edge driven by structure, intensity and crowd energy.",
      "Brentford are aggressive in duels, strong in second balls and ruthless in moments that matter. They turn games into uncomfortable experiences for visiting teams.",
      "Oliver Glasner's impending departure at the end of the season matters. Even the most professional squads feel it when leadership has an expiry date. Messages lose a fraction of their bite. It doesn't mean Palace will down tools but it does mean focus can blur at the margins and at this level fine margins decide Premier League games.",
      "Chelsea, fresh from their own off-field shake-up, arrive with something Palace lack right now: clarity. No looming exits. No major distractions. Just points to chase and a clear objective under Liam Rosenior to finish in the Champions League places. In matches like this, that mental clarity is an underrated edge and does make Chelsea an interesting betting proposal at Evens with Sky Bet.",
      "Joelinton and emotional control have always lived on opposite sides of the street. He plays on the edge because Newcastle need him to. Intensity, duels, aggression - it's his job description. And against Aston Villa, that edge has repeatedly tipped into yellow card territory.",
      "Joelinton has been booked in five of the last seven meetings between Newcastle and Villa. That's not a coincidence. Villa bring the kind of technical ball carriers and intelligent movers that force Joelinton into recovery challenges, late tackles and tactical fouls.",
      "Morgan Rogers, Youri Tielemans and Ollie Watkins are card magnets. Since the start of last season, that trio have collectively drawn 48 cards from opposition players. They're clever with their movement, sharp on the turn and excellent at inviting contact in dangerous areas.",
      "The 9/4 with Sky Bet for Joelinton to be carded is a serious runner.",
      "Bukayo Saka's current run of 12 games without a goal in all competitions is his joint-longest drought for Arsenal. From a surface view, that type of run would put people off selecting him in the goalscorer markets. But I see it differently. Trends in football always snap. And timing is everything when it comes to snapping them for profit.",
      "Saka is still Arsenal's creative heartbeat, the outlet for danger and the player most likely to exploit half-chances in the final third. Arsenal are likely to control large portions of this game and Saka will be central to creating or finishing chances.",
      "From a betting standpoint, the question isn't whether Saka will score eventually - it's when. This looks the time to jump on at 7/4 with Sky Bet.",
      "Dominic Calvert-Lewin facing Everton for the first time in his career is a classic \"ex-factor\" scenario. A player with motivation, familiarity and unfinished business - all variables that can't be factored into his goalscorer prices. Add in his current form and this becomes a very juicy angle for punters. Calvert-Lewin has been in electric mood. Eight goals in his last 10 Premier League appearances underline his finishing sharpness and consistency.",
      "He's leading the line for a Leeds team that have netted 17 goals in their last nine Premier League games - second only to Manchester City (18), which paints a picture of a confident team. You can get 2/1 on Calvert-Lewin finding the net.",

      "Thursday 22 January 2026 18:29, UK",
      "Casemiro will leave Manchester United at the end of the season upon the expiry of his current deal at Old Trafford.",
      "The announcement of his departure brings an end to a four-year stay at Old Trafford, which has seen him score in a League Cup final victory in 2023 and reach two FA Cup finals, winning the competition in 2024.",
      "Casemiro was also part of the United side that reached the Europa League final in May of last season.",

      "The decision also gives Casemiro clarity for the rest of the season as he also prepares to represent Brazil in the World Cup in the summer.",
      "\"I will carry Manchester United with me throughout my entire life,\" Casemiro said in a statement.",

Casemiro was all over the place and his legs had gone - as had his confidence.",
      "There was a feeling that the midfielder United had splashed £70m on in 2022 was no longer fit for purpose. Now, as he approaches his Old Trafford swansong, he leaves with his reputation fully intact.",
      "Some eyebrows were raised when a 30-year-old five-time Champions League winner traded the Spanish capital for a spot in Erik ten Hag's Manchester United.",
      "However, a stellar first season that saw United finish third was some justification as a 'quick fix' appeared a stroke of real genius. Naturally on the wane, tougher seasons and poorer performances would follow but his importance would remain a fixture.",
      "Leaning on his experience, Ruben Amorim grew to rely on Casemiro in midfield after initially opting against fielding the veteran. Important goals like the one that helped United end a six-year trophy drought in the form of a Carabao Cup continued as Casemiro would prove clutch across various periods.",
      "Now Michael Carrick, a world-class midfielder himself during his playing career, has also recognised his importance as Casemiro started and impressed in his derby-day bow at Old Trafford.",
      "Success is relative, especially in regards to what Manchester United are now compared to the Real Madrid side Casemiro left. However, like Raphael Varane before him who made the same switch, Casemiro's significance in a side battling through transition will be a point in his career he looks back on fondly.",

      "But do not rule out other clubs emerging either as it gets closer to the deadline, which is just 11 days away.",
      "Clubs interested: Juventus, Aston Villa",
      "Mateta has told Crystal Palace he wants to leave the club this month. He has wanted to leave since last summer when multiple clubs tried to sign him and he did not agree a new contract with Palace.",
      "The strongest team on him has been Juventus, but they have other options too such as Youssef En Nesyri. Aston Villa are also interested in Mateta but appear to be prioritising Tammy Abraham at Besiktas. Those two are not the only clubs.",
      "However, Crystal Palace are not actively trying to sell Mateta and it would require a significant offer for the club to be tempted to sell.",
      "They still value Mateta around £35m and, as things stand, an exit is not close. In the background is uncertainty around head coach Oliver Glasner and the club are trying to stabilise a rocky point in their season.",
      "So far, Juventus are prepared to pay around £26m (€30m) to sign him in a proposal that would involve an initial loan for £1.7m and then a £24.3m obligation to buy in the summer.",
      "Sky in Italy's Gianluca Di Marzio has reported Palace have rejected an initial offer from Juventus. The Serie A club are willing to offer Mateta a four-year deal too with a significant pay rise.",
      "Palace turned down bids for Mateta from Champions League clubs in the summer and there was also a late enquiry - but no bid - from Tottenham Hotspur before they signed Randal Kolo Muani on loan from Paris Saint-Germain on Deadline Day.",
      "Atalanta, AC Milan and several Premier League clubs were also interested in Mateta in the summer but a move did not happen.",
      "Since Glasner's first Premier League game in charge of Palace in February 2024, only Erling Haaland and Mohamed Salah have scored more league goals than Mateta (35).",
      "At 28, he wants to play for a Champions League club or for a club who have a good chance of playing in the competition next season.",
      "He also wants to play for France in the World Cup after he was called up for the first time in October and he scored his first goal away at Iceland. But he faces tough competition for a place in a highly talented squad.",
      "Palace executive chairman Steve Parish is a notoriously tough negotiator, and he has always been reluctant to let any players leave on the cheap. And Palace want to strengthen their squad this month after selling Marc Guehi to Manchester City.",
      "They want to try and win the Conference League and finish as high as possible in the Premier League, keeping Glasner for the rest of his contract in the process.",
      "Club interested: Aston Villa",
      "Aston Villa have been stepping up their efforts to sign Tammy Abraham after Villa officials and the player's representatives watched him play for Besiktas in Istanbul on Monday night. The club were in Turkey to play Fenerbahce on Thursday night.",
      "Villa want to strengthen their squad after selling Donyell Malen to Roma on January 16 but money remains tight at the club and they are conscious of ensuring they meet their PSR obligations.",
      "Villa's high wage bill relative to their revenue means they have to be careful when it comes to spending in the transfer market. UEFA fined Villa £9.5m in July last year for breaking their financial rules.",
      "It is believed Besiktas now own Abraham's registration after he met the criteria to join them permanently amid an initial loan deal from Roma - and he is believed to keen to return to Villa, whom he spent time on loan at from Chelsea earlier in his career.",
      "Abraham spent a hugely successful 2018-19 season on loan at Villa from Chelsea. He scored 26 times to help Villa win promotion back to the Premier League via the play-offs.",
      "Other clubs - in the Premier League and in Europe - are also interested in Abraham this month and Villa now have injury problems in midfield, with John McGinn joining Boubakar Kamara on the sidelines.",
      "Villa have already been in for midfielders this month, missing out on signing Conor Gallagher to Tottenham Hotspur. They are also trying to find a solution for Harvey Elliott, whom they do not want to play any further to avoid having to sign him permanently from Liverpool for £35m.",
      "Clubs interested: Leeds, Nottingham Forest, West Ham",
      "Leeds United are the latest of multiple clubs to make enquiries to Wolves for striker Jorgen Strand Larsen.",
      "The 25-year-old, who is valued at £40m by the struggling bottom side, is also attracting interest from West Ham, Nottingham Forest and Crystal Palace.",
      "Leeds are aware of the competition for Strand Larsen and have to be cautious with PSR in this transfer window. As things stand, they have simply expressed their interest in the player with Wolves.",
      "Departures could help Leeds to make room for incomings, and Jack Harrison has now joined Fiorentina. Joel Piroe could also leave in the next days. However, as things stand Leeds believe he wants to stay and fight for his place and the club will not push him out the door.",
      "Crystal Palace are believed to have made an enquiry too, and that is one to watch considering the growing uncertainty around Mateta's future at the club.",
      "Since their own Strand Larsen enquiry, West Ham have signed two new forwards in Pablo and Taty Castellanos, with Callum Wilson also increasingly likely to stay.",
      "Nottingham Forest are the other club to be keen on Strand Larsen but they appear to be focussing on Lorenzo Lucca on loan from Napoli.",
      "Norway international Strand Larsen was the subject of intense interest from Newcastle in the summer, and since he has scored only three times for struggling Wolves this season, in 13 appearances, his value has depreciate somewhat.",
      "Wolves are weighing up what they can do in the market to make themselves more competitive but also protect the long-term, which may include a period in the Championship.",
      "Clubs interested: Everton, Nottingham Forest",
      "Everton and Nottingham Forest have enquired about Sunderland striker Wilson Isidor.",
      "No concrete approach has been made yet as both clubs are also considering or waiting on other targets, whom are on this list.",
      "The Frenchman also has interest in him from multiple clubs overseas, and he is one to watch with 11 days left of this window.",
      "The 25-year-old's contract is up in 2028 and he has fallen down the striking pecking order at Sunderland behind Brian Brobbey and sometimes Eliezer Mayenda.",
      "Isidor has not been in a Premier League squad since New Year's Day and has not started two games in a row since November.",
      "Isidor has scored only four Premier League goals this season, and none since October.",
      "Clubs interested: Everton, Nottingham Forest, Juventus, Napoli, Sevilla",
      "Youssef En Nesyri impressed as Morocco reached the AFCON final and it has ramped up interest in him from a number of clubs across Europe.",
      "The Fenerbahce striker, known to Premier League clubs for some time after his impressive stint at Sevilla in Spain, is firmly on the radar of Nottingham Forest and Everton this month.",
      "There is competition from two Italian giants, however, in Juventus - exploring him as an alternative to Mateta - and Antonio Conte's Napoli, who are preparing to lose Lorenzo Lucca to Forest or elsewhere on loan.",
      "According to Sky in Italy, even former club Sevilla have made an inquiry about getting En Nesyri back to the club.",
      "Aston Villa play against Fenerbahce on Thursday night in the Europa League and although it is not clear how much they like En Nesyri themselves, a match-winning performance for the Turkish club would be hard to ignore if that is what he produces.",
      "Clubs interested: Nottingham Forest, Besiktas, Benfica",
      "Nottingham Forest have agreed loan terms with Napoli for Lorenzo Lucca, according to Sky in Italy, but the striker has not given a final decision over his future and discussions continue.",
      "Pisa - his former club - are also interested in Lucca and have offered him a chance to stay in Italy so the situation remains in the balance and down to the player.",
      "Forest are therefore also working on other options, some mentioned above, and also including Evan Ferguson.",
      "Forest have made signing a striker a priority following an injury to Chris Wood and uncertainty over the progress of Arnaud Kalimuendo, who has gone to Germany on loan for his development.",
      "Lucca is a 25-year-old Italy international who is technically on loan at Napoli from Udinese. However, Napoli hold an obligation to buy him and so would execute that obligation before he would be able to move anywhere else.",
      "Therefore, if Forest do indeed loan him, it would be from Napoli and not Udinese.",
      "Club interested: Roma",
      "Roma will begin preparing a proposal for Manchester United forward Joshua Zirkzee this week, according to Sky in Italy.",
      "They have been waiting in the wings to move for the forward while United had Bryan Mbeumo away at AFCON and the change of head coach at Old Trafford needed time to conclude.",
      "However, against Manchester City in Michael Carrick's first game in charge, Zirkzee was not even in the matchday squad. It was said he had a minor injury.",
      "A strong Roma advance will almost certainly test the resolve of both player and club if it comes.",
      "Clubs interested: Nottingham Forest, Fulham",
      "With Roma aiming to make changes to their forward line, including potentially bringing in Zirkee from United, Evan Ferguson's situation on loan there is in doubt.",
      "Napoli and Forest are keeping an eye on the situation and the decision is down to Roma, with Brighton deputy chair Paul Barber confirming earlier in the window that they do not have the option to recall him.",
      "\"It's very unlikely, I would say (that he returns to Brighton),\" Barber said. \"We don't have that option, so if he were to come back it would be because the club that has him at the moment doesn't need him in the second half of the season.",
      "\"At the moment it seems very unlikely - he's playing well and scoring goals, it's not really one that is in our gift.\"",
      "Fulham have also long looked at Ferguson as a way of strengthening at centre-forward but their priority remains to sign PSV Eindhoven's Ricardo Pepi.",
      "If Ferguson's loan is terminated and he arrives back at Brighton, there is expected to be increased interest from other clubs in taking him on loan for the second half of the campaign.",
      "Although Roma are exploring changes, Ferguson has impressed there. He has scored five goals in 21 appearances including two in five games in the Europa League. It has been a positive step in his development so far, playing in Italy.",
      "Callum Wilson (West Ham), Joel Piroe (Leeds), David Datro Fofana (Chelsea/Fatih Karagümrük), Ricardo Pepi (PSV Eindhoven), Artem Dovbyk (Roma)"

      "United's first goal against City on Saturday evoked something for those present at Old Trafford. You could not help but feel something.",
      "Instantly my mind went back to iconic goals scored against Arsenal. Whether that was in the Champions League second-leg in 2009 - led by Cristiano Ronaldo, Park-ji Sung and Wayne Rooney - or a year later in the Premier League where Nani and Rooney (again) led their own devastating counter-attacking display against the Gunners.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo's opener was not just a classic counter-attacking goal. If you look at that second goal I just mentioned - it mirrored Rooney's lung-bursting run among five Arsenal players to receive the ball from Nani to score. Amad Diallo and Mbeumo showed the same urgency when Bruno Fernandes found himself in the perfect position to lead the counter.",
      "Context is then required. The weeks of tension and impatience building from the Old Trafford crowd after dour and frustrating performances against Wolves, West Ham and Burnley in the last month had led to most thinking: where was their next win going to come from?",
      "The Manchester derby was an impressive victory for Michael Carrick and his backroom staff, but there is also a hesitance to get too carried away. Despite that being the best 90 minute performance in years, this United team have shown they can deliver in one-off games.",
      "But I am already more curious as to how this team will perform in the games after Arsenal when Carrick's side face Fulham, Tottenham and West Ham.",
      "This is where we will find out whether they are in serious contention for a Champions League place.",
      "I said similar in November and December when they had a run of games against 'lower' positioned opposition and they failed to capitalise during that time which eventually led to Ruben Amorim's departure.",
      "This is a second chance.",
      "It was quite clear watching some of United's training session this week and speaking to those around the club as they prepared for Arsenal that there have been some subtle changes.",
      "Carrick addressed the players at the start of the session, as Amorim would, but it was still intriguing to see how hands on Carrick was in his role as head coach as they began their drills. This was the first time we had a glimpse of training with our Sky cameras in attendance.",
      "From the open section we saw, watching Carrick, Jonathan Woodgate and Steve Holland run the session in unison was fascinating.",
      "Holland, in particular, made an impression - pushing and encouraging the players to maintain a high level. It sounds obvious but Holland's experience carried a certain authority that was notable from where we were standing.",
      "One change under Carrick and his backroom staff has been shortening the sessions while increasing the intensity within them. There has been a notable and positive reaction among the first team in response.",
      "Although we were not able to see this in the open part of the session, from what I understand another positive change has been the increase in individual work with different players in the squad.",
      "It was widely understood under Amorim, the team would spend a lot of time on the training ground walking through systems and formations they would set up in.",
      "Despite Amorim saying this time on the training ground would yield more positive results the more this side trained on the pitch, that did not happen. This is not a criticism of the Portuguese coach but whatever the team worked on, it did not lead to the consistency needed for him to succeed.",
      "The shorter but intense sessions coupled with an increased amount of time spent on individual work has led (albeit one game in) to a positive atmosphere being created under Carrick.",
      "But there is also important messaging from Carrick and his staff.",
      "As mentioned before, no one inside or outside Carrington will get carried away with one win against Manchester City because of the false starts under previous coaches.",
      "But as Carrick announced to the media during his first week in charge, he has told his players they should enjoy playing for the club and while not getting carried away, embrace the responsibility and privilege that comes with the shirt.",
      "Time will tell whether these changes will have a short-lived impact on the team or whether they will be the foundations of a successful second-half of the season for United.",
      "What is clear is that this coaching staff have made an impression on this group of players and after such a challenging 14 months under Amorim if they can start enjoying their football again then they may just find themselves in the Champions League next season.",

      "The Red Devils were once regarded as the blueprint for commercial success in football and have topped the Money League in 10 of its 29 editions, most recently in 2017.",
      "However, United are down in eighth in the 2026 table, in part due to broadcast revenue dropping from €258m [£216.72m] to €206m [£172.9m] because of their absence from the Champions League in 2024-25.",
      "The club are set to generate even less matchday revenue in the current season due to their total absence from European competition, and their failure to go past the first hurdle in either domestic cup means they will play only 20 competitive fixtures at Old Trafford in 2025-26.",
      "\"The clubs with the biggest football club brands and position in the market have an opportunity to broaden their reach and offer more to fans on a matchday, offer more to fans on a non-matchday, and become a more 365-days-a-year touch point,\" said Tim Bridge, the Sports Business Group Leader at Deloitte. \"United are probably only just starting that journey now, because of the reported stadium development.",
      "\"If you went back 10 or 15 years, and you looked at Manchester United's matchday revenue it was the industry leader. If you looked at their ability to generate commercial revenue, it was the benchmark by which everybody then went to market and set their strategy. I don't think that remains the case.",
      "\"The opportunity remains for Manchester United. They are arguably still the biggest global football club brand, and therefore they have the opportunity to maximise that in a way that is only possible for a select few.",
      "\"But to do that requires fit-for-purpose facilities. As the industry evolves, clubs should ask themselves whether there is a need to rethink how they engage with fans and how that relationship works. With reports of the new stadium, it is clear they have started to do some of that, so it's very clear they're thinking in that way. Their timing of making that change is behind Real Madrid and Barcelona, but the opportunity remains.\"",

      "Liverpool sit fifth after their return to the Champions League in 2024-25 and a seven per cent increase in commercial revenue from non-matchday events at Anfield.",
      "It is the first time there has not been an English team in the Money League top four, with Real, Barcelona, Bayern Munich and Paris Saint-Germain all benefiting from going deep in the newly expanded Champions League and the expanded FIFA Club World Cup in the summer.",

      "Premier League teams may expect to fare better generally in the 2027 Money League, which will be the first to reflect the new broadcast deal which runs to 2029, but Bridge said the best-performing clubs would continue to be those who match on-field success with diversification off it.",
      "\"The trick to staying [in the top five] is maintaining both of those. It used to be you only had to maintain one of them. Now, in 2026, we're at a point where the highest revenue generating clubs are probably broader than football,\" he said.",

      "For a fourth year, the Deloitte Football Money League profiles 15 of the top revenue generating women's clubs globally. In another record-breaking year, these clubs reported average revenues in excess of €10m [£8.4m] for the first time, with cumulative revenues of €158m [£132.72m], marking an increase of 35 per cent on last year's total.",
      "Arsenal Women tops the list this year, dethroning FC Barcelona Femení for the first time, with revenues of €25.6m [£21.5m], an increase of 43 per cent from the previous season. Significant investment into fan data and activation helped garner attendances exceeding 35,000 on five separate occasions across the 2024/25 season.",
      "Chelsea Women ranks in a close second [£21.3m] while generating the highest commercial revenue among the top 15 [£16m]. FC Barcelona Femení [£18.5m] completes the top three after another successful domestic season.",
      "\"While growth has developed significantly in women's football in recent years, the shift from the start up phase to the established phase requires consistent time, investment, and effort to develop the foundations in the right manner,\" said Jennifer Haskel, knowledge and insight lead in the Deloitte Sports Business Group.",
      "\"As further milestones are hit, including new and expanded competitions on the biggest stages, industry leaders must continue to innovate, while also protecting the wants and needs of fans and players to foster a more sustainable future for the game.\"",

      "Diogo Dalot's challenge on Jeremy Doku in Manchester derby was worthy of a red card according to PGMOL chief Howard Webb; But VAR was right not to intervene in 10th-minute incident that saw the Man Utd defender only shown a yellow",
      "Tuesday 20 January 2026 15:48, UK",
      "PGMOL chief Howard Webb is unconvinced that Diogo Dalot’s challenge on Jeremy Doku in Man Utd’s 2-0 win over Man City was worthy of a red card - but is convinced that VAR was right not to intervene.",
      "Dalot escaped a red card for a 10th-minute tackle on Doku, which ex-Premier League referee Mike Dean believed was \"100 per cent\" a sending off.",
      "The Man Utd defender was only shown a yellow card by referee Anthony Taylor, with VAR Craig Pawson backing the on-field decision.",
      "Analysing the decision on Mic'd Up, Webb said: \"Is there excessive force? Some will say, yes. I'm not quite there, but I can see that there could be.",
      "\"It's a subjective judgment…but I'm absolutely aligned that once that decision is taken on the field, we leave it as referee's call and we don't intervene with the VAR.\"",
      "He added: \"I think it's one where the referee's call should stand on the field. That's what we've said we'll do where there's a mix of considerations.",
      "\"I think there is a mix, and therefore in this situation, it was right to leave it as the referee's call.",
      "\"If a red had been given, I would have expected the red card to stand as well, in the same way.\"",
      "Man City boss Pep Guardiola felt Dalot should have been sent off after an early foul on Jeremy Doku.",
      "But VAR Pawson stood by Taylor's on-field decision, believing the contact was \"glancing and not with force\".",
      "Webb said: \"At full speed, when you play it in real time, you can see there's not a great deal of speed in the action, not a lot of intensity.",
      "\"We were heavily criticised a few years ago for using slow motion and freeze frames because people said, this is not reality. It's not how the game is played. When you slow it down, it can look a lot worse - and it does. When you freeze frame it, you can make a lot of situations look like red card offences.",
      "\"So it's difficult for me to hear people make a judgment on this just by analysing freeze frame and slow motion, coming to the consideration that it's red on that basis.",
      "\"Yes, it could be red, but you have to think about the need to look at it at full speed. We've done that for some time now. We thought it was a fair criticism some time ago when people said, 'Stop using slow-mos as the main way of analysing these situations'. And we've listened, and we agree. And we play it at full speed. Then we slow it down a little bit to see the exact point of contact to factor that in as well.",
      "\"But without speed and force and intensity, it's unlikely to be a red card.\"",
      "Speaking at half-time at Old Trafford, Keane said: \"Doku definitely helps him [by not staying down]. I'm no expert on red cards, but I think it's a red.\"",
      "Richards said: \"He [Dalot] is on top of his knee. That is as clear a red card as you are going to see. What more do you want?!\"",
      "Ex-Premier League referee Dermot Gallagher speaking on Ref Watch:",
      "\"I thought it was a red card.",
      "\"He's gone in high and with a straight leg. He's hit him with his studs on the knee. The ball is not there, it's gone, so for me, it's a red card but for others, it is not.\"",
      "Former Cardiff and England striker Jay Bothroyd agreed with Gallafger on Ref Watch:",
      "\"I can't believe Dalot has tried to appeal the yellow card. It's a terrible challenge.",
      "\"The priority for the referees is player safety. When you see challenges like that, Doku could have ended up really hurt.",
      "\"To me, it wasn't a glancing blow. His studs are up and it is above the ankle. I don't understand how it is not a red card.",
      "\"It's a terrible decision. That's going to be one of the worst decisions of the season.\"",
      "On Mic'd Up, the full transcript between referee Taylor, VAR Pawson and assistant VAR, Adrian Holmes, was released and showed how the officials concluded staying with Taylor's on-field yellow card decision...",
      "Ref: \"I'm going yellow card, it's a glance.\"",
      "VAR: \"Yeah, he does, he's glancing contact on the knee. There's no force, but there is glancing contact. He's tried to play the ball, and he catches it with glancing contact. Glancing contact, there's no force. He's tried to play the ball, he flicks, he misses the ball, he catches him with a follow-through. I'm happy to confirm the on-field decision.\"",

      "Jamie Carragher has outlined his four-man shortlist to be the next Manchester United head coach, suggesting that their next permanent boss must be a candidate with the right \"energy\" and \"drive\" to lead the club forward.",
      "United parted ways with Ruben Amorim earlier this month after a disastrous 14-month reign at the club and have since appointed Michael Carrick as head coach until the end of the season.",
      "Carrick secured an impressive 2-0 win against rivals Manchester City in his first game at the helm, but Carragher has insisted Old Trafford needs a \"special\" leader.",
      "Here are the options and what Carragher had to say...",
      "Current role: England manager",
      "What Carragher said: \"He's been in the Premier League before. He's obviously a top manager. The thing I like about him is I still think he's got that energy and drive and spikiness about him.",
      "\"He's gone into the England squad, and he's ruffled feathers with some of the biggest players there. Now I'm not saying that has to happen in every job he's in, but there's something about him.",
      "\"He just feels like he would go to war for your club, and he'd be fighting against the other clubs, and he'd have something about him.\"",
      "Current role: Paris Saint-Germain",
      "What Carragher said: \"You would absolutely have him all day. Now we see him as the best manager in Europe. He didn't have a good time at Celta Vigo, he didn't have a good time at Roma, but Barcelona still appointed him.\"",
      "Current role: Newcastle United",
      "What Carragher said: \"I'm a huge fan of Eddie Howe. The type of football when Newcastle are at their best is high energy going forward, but the real thing I like is that you have to be able to handle the pressures of Manchester United.",
      "\"When you're in Newcastle and you live in that city, it's constant and he handles it brilliantly. Where I think he could also help is that Manchester United have a problem with young players - a lot of them don't go on to fulfil their potential - but I think Eddie Howe is a great coach.\"",
      "Current role: Germany",
      "What Carragher said: \"I don't know everything about him but I do look at a coach with a big reputation, with a lot to prove in some ways.\"",
      "What Carragher said: \"I'm crossing out Michael Carrick. I go back to this question - do I believe this guy can win the league? I have to believe he can. I don't believe Man Utd will win the league with Carrick, or Chelsea will with Liam Rosenior. I'm not trying to be disrespectful, but you have to be special. I might be proven wrong.\"",
      "Carragher also highlighted why other candidates, such as Xabi Alonso, Diego Simeone and Oliver Glasner, aren't suitable for the role.",
      "\"Jurgen Klopp will not be managing Manchester United. That is out. Xabi Alonso - he cannot do that. He can't, his affiliation with Liverpool. That can't happen.",
      "\"Carlo Ancelotti, for me, wouldn't have the energy or drive to get Man Utd back. Zinedine Zidane is a younger version of [Carlo] Ancelotti, but maybe I am wrong. Enzo Maresca is a no, but he is a really good coach.",
      "\"Xavi is one, at Barcelona, he won the league but enough experience for Manchester United? He only has a couple of years of experience as a manager.",
      "\"Roberto Martinez, if he does a brilliant job at Portugal, there is no doubt that Roberto is ready. The one thing he has not done in his career is manage an elite football club.",
      "\"He'd have to do something really special. Mauricio Pochettino is the same as Ancelotti. Chelsea went with Enzo Maresca as they wanted a young and energetic coach.",
      "Oliver Glasner, straight away, I'd say no because of the system. Andoni Iraola has done a brilliant job and is linked with top jobs but Bournemouth to Man Utd is a big jump.",
      "\"This is the same for Marco Silva. I think the next step for them would be Tottenham. It feels more Tottenham-like for them. Roberto De Zerbi is a brilliant coach but he is liable to go to war with the owners within six weeks.",
      "\"Diego Simeone is an interesting one. I was speaking to Gary Neville about United's DNA. It is interesting that Roy [Keane] and Gary have both mentioned Simeone at different points.",
      "\"That goes away from what a club's DNA is because he is a defensive coach. You can't ask a manager to change.\"",
