      "Manchester United are reportedly planning to bolster their wing-back and midfield options next summer, but they haven't ruled out making moves in the upcoming transfer window. ESPN reports that the Red Devils will likely approach January with caution.",
      "The club had a busy summer, welcoming six new faces to Ruben Amorim's squad, sparking rumours that more signings could be on the horizon. Benjamin Sesko, Bryan Mbeumo, Matheus Cunha, Senne Lammens, and Diego Leon all made the move to Old Trafford during the summer transfer window, costing the club a hefty £236million.",
      "Carlos Baleba of Brighton and Hove Albion was also heavily linked with a move to United, but a deal failed to materialise. ESPN suggests that alongside Baleba, Elliot Anderson and Adam Wharton are among the names being considered as potential midfield targets. United have also reportedly been eyeing up moves for Wolves pair Joao Gomes and Andre, as well as Angelo Stiller and Conor Gallagher.",
      "It's believed that United's recruitment strategy for next summer will focus on bringing in 'at least one' top-level midfielder.",
      "Casemiro, whose contract expires in the summer, could be offered a new deal on reduced terms.",
      "However, United may decide to sever ties and seek a long-term solution. Despite this, Manuel Ugarte has yet to prove himself as United's first-choice defensive midfielder.",
      "While a bit of transfer activity could be on the cards in January, ESPN suggests that 'nothing has been ruled out,' but the majority of their dealings are likely to be postponed until the summer.",
      "Next month, Amorim will have to make do without Mbeumo, Amad and Noussair Mazraoui due to their commitments at the Africa Cup of Nations, while Sesko is currently nursing a knee injury he picked up against Tottenham.",
      "Meanwhile, it seems that Marcus Rashford and Jadon Sancho, two of the club's top earners, may be heading for pastures new away from Old Trafford.",
      "Despite splashing the cash on new signings last summer, the club feels that 'there are limitations' with the squad currently available to Amorim.",

      "Manchester United is a better place without Marcus Rashford and Jadon Sancho. That's the view of former United star Louis Saha, who reckons Ruben Amorim's dressing room less poisonous, now Rashford and Sancho have left.",
      "Rashford has joined Barcelona on-loan, with a view to making the move permanent next summer. Sancho is on-loan at Aston Villa, and will leave United on a free transfer in the close season.",
      "Saha said: \"The squad is much more harmonious. It's the best transfer you can make. When you have one player that is not pulling their weight, you can just about manage.",
      "\"You can leave them out of the side, and the rest of the squad can cope. But when you have three or four players who are really talented, but just arent at the races, then it drags the team down a level.",
      "\"It's really hard for the manager to turn that situation around, so I think it's very important to act decisively in situations like that.",
      "\"So Amorim got rid of them. He replaced them with (Benjamin) Sesko, (Bryan) Mbeumo and (Matheus) Cunha, and now United are playing at a higher level than what we had before.",
      "\"These three work hard, they're willing to defend, they don't think they’re bigger than the team. With a negative attitude, a team is in big trouble.\"",
      "Speaking to Pundit Arena, the former France international added: \"I think that was the main goal for United in the transfer market. Players who thought about themselves above the team, they needed to go.",
      "\"The squad is more balanced now. You need at least three quarters of your team to be dedicated, willing to sacrifice, and talented too.",
      "\"You can afford a few flair players who might not always have that attitude, but it has to be a small minority. Back when I was there, we had Gary and Phil Neville, John O’Shea, Wes Brown. They made life easier for us.\"",

      "Manchester United's Patrick Dorgu has stirred the pot by liking a social media post criticising Ruben Amorim's midfield selection of Casemiro and Bruno Fernandes. The Red Devils have had a rocky start to the season, currently sitting 10th in the Premier League with just five victories from their first 12 matches.",
      "Despite impressive wins such as their triumph over Liverpool at Anfield, their recent defeat to Everton at Old Trafford has dampened spirits. A key feature of United's strategy this season has been the midfield duo of skipper Fernandes and Casemiro.",
      "Both players were on the pitch for the disappointing 1-0 loss to the Toffees on Monday night, until Casemiro was replaced by Kobbie Mainoo just shy of the 60-minute mark after picking up a booking.",
      "However, it seems not everyone in the dressing room is on board with the manager's current player use. Dorgu gave his approval to an Instagram post arguing that Fernandes and Casemiro should not be playing together.",
      "The post, shared by \"mufcunion\", featured a screenshot from X which read: \"Any coach that sees Casemiro and Bruno Fernandes as a viable pivot is one that isn't serious.\"",
      "The caption of the Instagram post declared: \"Bruno Fernandes and Casemiro CANNOT play together,\" and received a like from Dorgu, who joined United from Lecce for £25m earlier this year. The wing-back has made 12 appearances across all competitions this season, contributing one assist.",
      "Fernandes and Casemiro have been a formidable duo for Manchester United this season, starting together in 10 out of the club's 13 matches across all competitions.",
      "The only exceptions were during a heavily rotated squad against Grimsby Town in the Carabao Cup second round, and two league games against Brentford and Manchester City.",
      "In those matches, Manuel Ugarte was chosen to partner Fernandes in place of Casemiro. However, the selection for the Brentford match was enforced due to Casemiro receiving a red card in the previous game against Chelsea.",
      "Casemiro's future at Old Trafford is currently up in the air as his contract nears its end. Despite having a better season compared to the last, it remains unclear whether the 33-year-old Brazilian will extend his stay with United.",
      "This has led to United being linked with several midfield reinforcements over the summer, including Brighton's Carlos Baleba, while Nottingham Forest's Elliot Anderson is the latest name to be thrown into the mix ahead of the January transfer window.",
      "However, such social media activity from Dorgu criticising the manager's selection decisions does not bode well for him, the manager or his teammates.",

Ighalo joined United from Shanghai Shenhua on-loan in 2020, going on to score just five goals in 23 appearances. But Ighalo had to give up a £200,000-a-week deal in China in order to fulfil his dream of playing for United.",

      "Manchester United academy graduate Toby Collyer has suffered a major injury setback with a persistent hamstring injury continuing to plague him. The 21-year-old joined Championship side West Bromwich Albion in a season-long loan deal in the summer.",
      "A hamstring injury has limited the midfielder to just three Championship starts so far this season. Collyer returned earlier this month and was even deemed fit enough to start in Wednesday evening’s clash with Birmingham City.",
      "But Collyer’s return to the starting line-up lasted for just 11 minutes before he picked up another issue and was forced to depart. And West Brom boss Ryan Mason has claimed that his issue is a recurrence of an injury that has been blighting him for the past few years.",
      "\"It's a muscle injury, yes,\" Mason said. \"I think it's challenging for him, it's disappointing.",
      "\"He had a few last season at Man United, that's why I was very patient with him this season because I wanted to give him the best opportunity to grow into the demands of this league.",
      "\"But for something to happen after 10 minutes, it's disappointing. It looks like it (a hamstring issue). We'll assess him in the next couple of days and see where we're at with that.\"",
      "Collyer’s issue represents a fresh blow to the midfielder's hopes of adding some much-needed experience to his CV. Speaking earlier this month, Mason said: \"Toby's a young player, but we know we're going to need him and he's going to help us. I've wanted Toby for a few weeks now. He's someone that I really believe in, which is important and I have that belief in all of my players.",
      "\"But when you go on loan to somewhere, I think you need to feel like you're wanted from the club and the manager and he certainly is that. Hopefully we can help him because if we help him improve and grow as a player, then it's certainly going to be beneficial to us.",
      "\"I think there's loads of room and loads of growth to develop. That's certainly going to happen on the training pitch. The reality is the game is the best teacher.",
      "\"The more game exposure you can get, the better, especially at a young age. I'm sure and I expect that Toby knows that I believe in him, which for me is super important.",
      "\"I'm going to put a lot of energy, the same amount of energy that I've put into him as every other one of my players, to help them grow and improve.\"",

      "David Moyes' side went on to secure a 1-0 victory despite being reduced to 10 men for more than 80 minutes. Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall netted the only goal shortly after Gueye's dismissal, and the Toffees managed to hold firm and claim a massive three points.",
      "You can listen to brand new episodes of In The Mixer on Spotify and Apple Podcasts!",
      "Lescott, who played alongside Gueye at Aston Villa during the 2015/16 season, has since spoken with his former team-mate. And he offered reassurance to the Senegal international, as revealed on the latest episode of In The Mixer, brought to you by Sky Bet",
      "\"We've seen it with Idrissa as well, and I spoke to him after that and he was like, 'That was so out of character,'\" said Lescott. \"But I said, this happens, you're allowed to be out of character for one moment, you know what I mean? It's not like it's happened every week. It is okay.\"",
      "Everton took all three points from Old Trafford despite managing only 30% possession. They also registered just three shots at goal compared to United's 25, with goalkeeper Jordan Pickford making one particularly vital save from Joshua Zirkzee.",
      "Former England goalkeeper and podcast guest Joe Hart even suggested Gueye's dismissal could have been a blessing in disguise. While Everton wouldn't deliberately choose to play with 10 men, the team responded magnificently to the early blow and showed tremendous character when their task became significantly harder.",
      "\"Actually, in the hindsight of them winning the game, it's a massive moment. It can be a really big moment, good moment,\" said Hart. \"But it didn't feel right at the time. I was watching it thinking, 'What?' These are these are high emotional moments, you know.\"",
      "Gueye has since apologised to his Everton team-mates and reportedly spoke directly to Keane following Monday's result. However, he must still serve a three-match suspension that will rule him out during a crucial part of the winter schedule.",
      "In all probability, Gueye will link up with Senegal for the Africa Cup of Nations and would have been unavailable regardless. Nevertheless, he will miss at least the forthcoming matches against Newcastle, Bournemouth and Nottingham Forest.",
      "Lescott completed his final campaign in English football with Villa, while Gueye was still establishing himself in the Premier League when their paths crossed. After receiving support from his former colleague on Monday, Gueye issued a public apology for his conduct and abandoning his team-mates.",
      "\"I want to apologise first to Michael Keane,\" he said in a heartfelt post on social media. \"I take full responsibility for my reaction. I also apologise to my teammates, the staff, the fans and the club.",

      "One year after bringing the curtain down on a decorated career, City icon Hart has moved into the world of punditry himself. But the retired No. 1 is eager to stick to the facts and not allow his personal perceptions cloud his judgement.",
      "At least that's how he views Keane's past judgement of him as a person. And during a recent appearance on In The Mixer, brought to you by Sky Bet, Hart was asked about his reaction to Keane's \"cocky\" jibe and how he views those comments today.",

I was willing to work out what he was as a person. Was this something that he harboured deep inside him? He just says stuff.",
      "\"I doubt he wouldn't have been able to recall that moment. He don't care. But I take huge responsibility in my new role. Huge responsibility. I know the impact of my words. I know the impact, especially now social media, I know how that can bring needless attention to someone who's minding their own business and going about.\"",
      "It was back in 2012 that Keane suggested Hart had grown \"cocky\" in his England duties. The following year, he moved on by dubbing him outright \"arrogant\" and suggested he deserved to be dropped.",
      "In The Mixer regular Joleon Lescott, who spent five years playing alongside Hart at City, came to his old team-mate's defence. And it was his assertion that pundits should stick to commenting on what happens on the pitch, rather than delving into personal opinions of player personas.",
      "Hart continued: \"I agree with Joel, but I also think, 'You do you.' If that's how you want it, that's what you think and that's what's going to work for you. Like, I can't tell anyone how to behave. I've actually come into the punditry role now. Sometimes I question myself and I think, 'What is my job here?'",
      "\"Because sometimes early on in my career, I've been asked questions and I've gone, 'I don't want to answer that.' You know, constantly now, a conversation will come around someone's jobs. 'Do you think pressure’s starting to mount?'",
      "\"I just go, 'Look, I'm not talking about pressure [mounting]. That's someone's job, that's someone family'. I'm not gonna talk about it. You want me to talk about the results or how I think the team's playing? Not a problem. I'm not heaping any pressure on anyone's job or anyone's place in a team. That is not for me to do.\"",

      "An early red card for Idrissa Gueye after a clash with his team-mate Michael Keane did not help United’s cause. Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall still put the away side in front before the break and David Moyes’ team held on to claim a memorable three points.",
      "United’s lack of European football means Amorim has several days to mull over where his team went wrong. In terms of their hopes of returning to European competition, United currently sit 10th in the table but are still just three points off a Champions League spot.",
      "Ruben Amorim has hit back at claims that he refuses to change his tactics. The United boss has routinely been criticised throughout his tenure for sticking with his preferred back-three formation, with some pundits and sections of supporters arguing that his squad are not best suited to the system.",
      "Earlier this season, Amorim claimed that not even the Pope could get him to change his system. However, the United boss has now admitted that he is willing to tweak his tactics and make in-game changes, referencing the fluid attack he adopted at Sporting CP which often saw Viktor Gyokeres operate out wide.",
      "\"We did it against Liverpool, it wasn't with Bryan Mbeumo, it was with Cunha,\" Amorim explained to DAZN Portugal. And it's an option that we have, and nowadays, everyone, I think not only in the English league but in the Portuguese league, in all leagues, there's a great variation in how things are structured.",
      "\"We might say it’s a 4-4-2, but five minutes later it’s a 4-3-3 or a 3-4-3. And therefore I'm willing to do anything, contrary to what many people think that I'm too fixated on one thing. I simply start with a basic foundation, but obviously, we can use it in the future.\"",
      "Manchester United are set to decide whether to send a trio of young prospects out on loan in the January transfer window. The Daily Mail reports that defender Ayden Heaven will be one of those under consideration as the 19-year-old has struggled for regular minutes this term and faces increased competition from a returning Lisandro Martinez.",
      "Summer signing Diego Leon could be another to seal a temporary move away from Old Trafford. The 18-year-old full-back has featured in matchday squads but is yet to make his first team debut and has been linked with a loan move to Nice.",

      "Bayer Leverkusen chief Simon Rolfes has revealed that making the fastest sacking in Bundesliga history by parting ways with Erik ten Hag was best for both parties. The club's Managing Director for Sport said it was his job to be decisive when he saw the partnership was not heading in the right direction.",
      "Ten Hag replaced Xabi Alonso at Leverkusen in the summer but was afforded just three games in the dugout. The Dutch coach saw a comfortable win over fourth-tier side SG Sonnenhof Grossaspach in his first match, before giving up leads against Hoffenheim and 10-man Werder Bremen to take a single point in the league.",
      "The German side now sit third in the Bundesliga after 11 matches, and defeated Manchester City in the Champions League last time out, under the tutelage of Kasper Hjulmand. Goals from Alejandro Grimaldo and Patrik Schick put City to the sword as Pep Guardiola was left to consider his mistakes.",
      "Rolfe spoke ahead of that game at the Etihad and was plain in his reasoning over the decision. \"At the end of the day it is about the connection with the people,\" he said.",
      "\"And we had the feeling it wasn't working out or heading on a good direction. So that's why it is better to stop, for both sides, and thats why we made the change.",
      "\"If you're not convinced, then this is my role as a leader. Then I have to take decisions - I only think about what's best for results.\"",
      "The dismissal saw Ten hag given the boot for the second time in less than 12 months. The former Ajax boss was sacked by Manchester United last season. The Dutch coach criticised Leverkusen following his exit.",
      "\"The decision by Bayer Leverkusen this morning to put me on a leave of absence came as a complete surprise. To part ways with a manager after just two league matches is unprecedented,\" said Ten Hag.",
      "\"This summer, many key players who were part of past successes left the squad. Building a new, cohesive team is a careful process that requires both time and trust.",
      "\"A new coach deserves the space to implement his vision, set the standards, shape the squad and leave his mark on the style of play.",
      "\"I started this job with full conviction and energy, but unfortunately, the management was not willing to grant me the time and trust I needed, which I deeply regret. I feel this was never a relationship based on mutual trust.",
      "\"Throughout my career, every season I have been able to see through to the end as a coach has brought success. Clubs that placed their trust in me have been rewarded with success and silverware.\"",
      "Ten Hag has already rejected another opportunity after turning down the chance to return for a second spell as Ajax manager. The Dutch giants sacked Johnny Heitinga earlier this season after a disastrous run of just two wins in 11 games.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Manchester United are considering letting three youngsters head out on loan once the January transfer window opens. United’s lack of European football this season and their early exit from the Carabao Cup has left Ruben Amorim with few opportunities to rotate and give fringe players minutes – and that could prompt action in the New Year.",
      "The team are generally only in action once per week, which means Amorim has been able to keep a level of consistency in his selections. While this did appear to be bearing fruit in a five-game unbeaten run in the Premier League before the 1-0 defeat by Everton on Monday, it has had some knock-on effects.",
      "United have a history of giving opportunities to academy graduates, but they have been thin on the ground this season. The situation is shown by Kobbie Mainoo’s struggles for game time, with the 20-year-old midfielder getting just 260 minutes across nine appearances so far this season, with his only start coming in the shambolic defeat by Grimsby in the Carabao Cup.",
      "Top young stars like Harry Amass and Radek Vitek left on loan to Sheffield Wednesday and Bristol City respectively and there are further plans in the works. The Daily Mail reports that Diego Leon, Sekou Kone and Ayden Heaven could be sent out on loan in January in order to get more game time.",
      "Leon joined United in a deal worth a potential £7million from Paraguayan side Cerro Porteno in the summer. But the 18-year-old left-back is yet to make his United first-team debut, with Luke Shaw and Patrick Dorgu among those ahead of him in the pecking order.",
      "He arrived with high hopes of breaking into Amorim’s plans, but has only made it onto the bench on four occasions this season. Having initially been reluctant to consider a loan move, Leon is frustrated by only playing for the under-21s and French side Nice – who are also owned by Ineos – could represent a good fit for him.",
      "Kone, a 19-year-old midfielder, joined United in the summer of 2024 and has been playing for the under-21s. He suffered a concussion in a National League Cup tie at Tamworth, which saw him taken to hospital last month, but has since returned to action.",
      "Heaven is highly rated by Amorim but has managed just 92 minutes of action this season. The centre-back was an unused substitute against Everton on Monday and faces further competition for places through the imminent return of Lisandro Martinez.",
      "The three youngsters’ exits are being weighed up, but those of Mainoo and Joshua Zirkzee are less likely to be sanctioned. Both players are unhappy with their lack of regular minutes for United, but Amorim has made the club’s position clear ahead of the Africa Cup of Nations starting next month, when United will lose Bryan Mbeumo, Amad Diallo and Noussair Mazraoui.",
      "\"I was a football player,\" he said on Monday. \"I understand everything, and I want to help my players in every situation. I understand the frustration of some players, seeing the World Cup is there. I know what it means.",
      "\"But the first thing is that the club comes first. If I can help the club and the players, I will be happy. If not, I have to think about the team.\"",

      "Former Manchester United ace Timothy Fosu-Mensah is reportedly on the radar of Sheffield Wednesday. The 27-year-old has been without a club since parting ways with Bayer Leverkusen in the summer of 2024, with current Real Madrid boss Xabi Alonso believed to have played a part in his early contract termination.",
      "Fosu-Mensah made the switch to the German outfit in a £1.8million move during the January transfer window of 2021 after spending five years at Old Trafford. Despite suffering serious knee and hamstring injuries that limited him to just 30 appearances over three-and-a-half years, he was part of their historic Bundesliga title triumph.",
      "Even though he hasn't played competitively since April 2023, the Star suggests that Sheffield Wednesday are considering bringing Fosu-Mensah on board. The Championship's bottom club is staring down the barrel of relegation to League One following a 12-point deduction.",
      "However, the Owls seem determined to stave off dropping into England's third tier next season, as evidenced by their interest in a player of Fosu-Mensah's calibre. Among those impressing at Hillsborough this season is United loanee Harry Amass, despite Sheffield Wednesday managing just a single win.",
      "Fosu-Mensah was given his first taste of senior team action at United by Louis van Gaal on the same day Marcus Rashford made his debut. He went on to make 30 first-team appearances, with 11 of those coming under the stewardship of Jose Mourinho.",
      "The right-back has been singing praises for the Portuguese manager, revealing that he played a significant role in his development.",
      "Speaking to The Sun in February 2024, he said: \"I spent the full season with the first team and, as a result, completed a full pre-season with them for the first time.",
      "\"I was still a teenager when Jose Mourinho arrived, and he helped me mature into becoming a man in footballing terms.",
      "\"Jose was tough on young players with his demands, but in a good way, because he wanted you to be ready to represent a club the size of Manchester United.\"",
      "However, despite Mourinho's guidance, Fosu-Mensah found it difficult to secure a regular spot at Old Trafford and decided to leave for more playing time.",
      "Fosu-Mensah explained: \"It was my decision. The manager was good to me but at the end, I was not playing a lot. When you are 22, 23, or 24 years old you need to be playing.",
      "\"I didn't play much and I wanted to. It was the best decision in the end to go somewhere else where I would get more minutes.\"",
      "Sadly, he only managed to clock up just 1,050 minutes for Leverkusen, but the former United academy star is clear about his goals for the future.",
      "In an interview with World Football Index last year, he stated: \"I have had a few spells out with injury so I want to stay injury free in order to play and perform at the highest level.",
      "\"Of course, I want to win more trophies in my career but the most important thing is to be able to enjoy my football and play at the highest level of the game.\"",

      "Manchester United chiefs accept that Ruben Amorim's squad is still limited despite allowing him to spend more than £200million on new players in the summer.",
      "The Portuguese boss, off the back of the club's worst ever Premier League showing, bought in Benjamin Sesko for £74m as well as Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo for a combined fee of over £120m. Senne Lammens also came in and has made the No 1 shirt his own.",
      "Despite the quality now available to him those at Old Trafford are tempering their expectations, acknowledging that Amorim can only do so much with the team he has. A number of positions still need to be strengthened before the head coach can be expected to produce regularly.",
      "United saw their momentum halted on Monday when they were beaten by Everton, ending a run of five games without defeat. They sit tenth after 12 games this term.",
      "The January transfer window opens in just over five weeks but, despite the need to bolster certain positions, ESPN reports that United are looking to bypass the mid-season window and instead do their business next summer.",
      "That said they remain open minded and will act if it is in their best interests. Injuries to key personnel may alter their stance but finding quality players for good value can often be a challenge midway through the season, when clubs tend to hike their prices.",
      "United believe their financial position will allow them to continue to invest in the squad, despite their notable outlay in the summer. They believe a number of top earners, the likes of Marcus Rashford and Jadon Sancho, will depart in the next sixth months, which will give them more freedom financially. A return to Europe would also aid their cause.",
      "Adding a central midfielder is among their priorities, likely in the summer. Several proven Premier League performers are already on their shortlist - the likes of Elliot Anderson, Adam Wharton and Carlos Baleba. They have also assessed Wolves duo Joao Gomes and Andre.",
      "The club also believe that Amorim needs more depth at wing-back - especially given their importance in his system. Early enquiries have been made about the availability of a number of targets with United largely using conventional full-backs in those positions.",

The Portuguese tactician has faced scrutiny for persisting with his system, despite enduring difficult periods in his 12 months at Old Trafford.",

      "During their run, they beat fierce rivals Liverpool to further assert that they are not pushovers, after previously finding the Anfield club difficult customers prior to his arrival from Sporting CP.",
      "United have proved that they can mix it with their Premier League rivals, but often struggled against lesser teams. Amorim was under immense scrutiny going into this season after failing to heed the slump last season, when he succeeded Erik ten Hag.",
      "High-profile former footballers have taken aim at Amorim throughout his tenure in the Premier League over his failure to resist changing his system, including club icons Gary Neville and Wayne Rooney.",
      "Amorim has already had to defend his decisions and tactics to United legends criticising him and rejected claims again that he is unwilling to change in light of the defeat to Everton, saying: \"We did it against Liverpool, it wasn't with Bryan Mbeumo, it was with Cunha. And it's an option that we have, and nowadays, everyone, I think not only in the English league but in the Portuguese league, in all leagues, there's a great variation in how things are structured.",
      "\"We might say it’s a 4-4-2, but five minutes later it’s a 4-3-3 or a 3-4-3. And therefore I'm willing to do anything, contrary to what many people think that I'm too fixated on one thing.",
      "\"I simply start with a basic foundation, but obviously, we can use it in the future. And we've already thought about that with Bryan [playing central] because he's very strong in transitions.",
      "\"I do think it's the best position for him [out wide] because he likes to be hidden, he doesn't like people watching him. He can attack, be more dangerous on one of the flanks, either the right or the left, rather than as a striker, but it's a good option, therefore I'll be able to use it in the future as I did several times at Sporting.\"",
      "Amorim's comments will no doubt please Mourinho, who clearly feels that the best managers need to adapt when the going gets tough.",
      "The 40-year-old United boss previously reiterated that his system was not the issue. He said: \"It is normal and you cannot run away from the results and then you have baggage from last season but for me last season doesn’t matter.",
      "\"We had six games this season and we lost three. We have to look to the games we lost, if we lost against Arsenal due to the system, it is your job to make the opinions. City and Brentford the way we gave away goals and created chances, it is nothing to do with the system. If we look to the games we didn’t win, people have different opinions and that is okay.\"",

      "Former Arsenal striker Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang stole the headlines after scoring twice and drawing comparisons to Didier Drogba in Marseille's 2-1 victory over Newcastle in the Champions League.",
      "Marseille hosted the Magpies at the Stade Velodrome on Tuesday evening and endured a difficult start as Harvey Barnes gave the visitors a 1-0 lead inside six minutes. But Aubameyang struck twice in quick succession after the break to secure a 2-1 win and earned widespread acclaim from the French media.",
      "Ex-Manchester United forward Mason Greenwood also played a key role in the Ligue 1 side's second-half fightback, and Le Parisien observed that he \"brilliantly found\" Aubameyang in the first 45 minutes, though the team couldn't convert that dominance into goals.",
      "Get Football France awarded the ex-United player a 5/10 rating, but Aubameyang earned 7/10 for his display. Le Figaro highlighted that Greenwood provided some \"perfect crosses\" but suggested the 24-year-old still needs time before becoming the club's main attraction.",
      "Veteran forward Aubameyang, however, drew parallels with former Chelsea legend Drogba, with Le Parisien declaring he \"stole the show.\"",
      "In their match analysis, the French publication said: \"He and Drogba have followed different paths, but share a common thread: they both knew how to ignite the Vélodrome.",
      "\"They are those great African strikers who carry the city, who instinctively understand what this jersey represents, this raw fervor, this simple and magnificent injunction: to go towards the goal, always.",
      "\"Like Drogba in his day, Aubameyang is now one of the providers. In a cauldron of a stadium, he scored more than just a brace: he perpetuated the tradition, he honoured the motto, he held Marseille close to his heart. Straight to the point. Always.\"",
      "French publication Le Figaro were similarly effusive in their praise of the former Arsenal striker, as they added: \"More than 20 years after the OM-Newcastle match in 2004, people in Marseille are still talking about Didier Drogba's exploits in that game.",
      "\"That might not be the case for Aubameyang. But his performance on Tuesday was still invaluable.\"",
      "Marseille weren't the only side to triumph over English opposition on Tuesday evening, with Bundesliga leaders Bayer Leverkusen claiming a memorable 2-0 victory against Manchester City at the Etihad Stadium.",
      "Barcelona proved the exception amongst European clubs facing Premier League sides, suffering a harsh 3-0 defeat to Chelsea at Stamford Bridge.",

      "Manchester City have been told that Pep Guardiola leaving the Etihad will be like when Sir Alex Ferguson stood down as United boss. Fergie retired back in 2013 after winning one final Premier League title.",
      "But his departure coincided with a serious decline in United's fortunes. Since Fergie rode into the sunset, United have not been crowned English champions or come remotely close to winning the Champions League.",
      "Guardiola is under contract at the Etihad until 2027 and will complete a decade's service before the start of next season. The Spaniard has said he has no plans to stand down - and could continue in his role until 2035. But club bosses know the Spaniard will call time on his incredible spell in charge at some stage.",
      "And former City defender Danny Mills reckons the impact of him leaving will be similar to when Fergie left United.",
      "\"It’s going to be very difficult to replace Pep Guardiola at Manchester City,\" Mills told BetWright. \"He’s brought such a unique style of play and coaching, which has been embedded in the club for almost a decade.",
      "\"The owners will have to consider whether they want to maintain that style, or move to a 'win at all costs' mentality, and totally rebrand. Up until a few seasons ago, I would've suggested Mikel Arteta as a potential replacement for Pep, but that obviously won't happen now given what he’s achieved and built at Arsenal.",
      "\"A lot depends on when Guardiola leaves the club, and who is available to replace him. \"I don't think the managerial role will be in high demand - it could be considered as a lose-lose situation for whoever succeeds Pep.",
      "\"When David Moyes replaced Sir Alex Ferguson, he was never going to replicate the success of the past, but the expectation was there.",
      "\"It’s highly unlikely that anyone will be able to better Pep's achievements, so it's going to be very difficult for the club and succeeding manager.\"",

      "Chelsea sent shockwaves through Europe on Tuesday night, as they demolished Catalan giants Barcelona 3-0 at Stamford Bridge. The task of welcoming Barca in the Champions League was always going to be daunting, given the calibre of their team.",
      "This was evident early on when Ferran Torres had a clear shot at goal but astonishingly missed, leaving the crowd in disbelief. Chelsea seized the moment, scoring off a smart corner routine which resulted in a Jules Kounde own-goal, just before Barcelona were reduced to 10-men due to Ronald Araujo receiving his second yellow card before half-time.",
      "Enzo Maresca's side kept up the pressure, with Estevao's superb solo effort doubling their lead after the break. It was further capitalised on when Pedro Neto found room behind the Barca defence, setting up Liam Delap for an easy goal.",
      "Three goals, three points and a resounding message to the rest of Europe that Chelsea mean business summed up a triumphant night for the Blues. Among the standout performers was Estevao, whose dazzling footwork and skills echoed those of many legendary players at Stamford Bridge, thrilling the fans.",
      "Following another stellar performance, the young Brazilian has received heaps of praise, including a comparison from Thierry Henry. Speaking on CBS Sports, the former Arsenal player said of Estevao: \"You wouldn't like to play against him.",
      "\"I'm not saying that you wouldn't be able to stop him, but he's coming at you all the time. He's reminding me of, I know it's early doors, but that's why I think Ryan Giggs was one of the best because he was coming at you for all the game.",
      "\"Whether he's having a good game or not a good game, he's trying to test you all the time and see if you're going to stop him or not. That's how it is as a winger.\"",
      "It's significant praise for the teenager, who's adapted well to the Premier League and Champions League. The 18-year-old officially arrived from Palmeiras during the summer in a transfer worth £29million, which may well prove exceptional value if he maintains his current trajectory.",
      "In only 17 appearances, Estevao has netted five times and provided one assist, while being carefully integrated into the squad by Maresca. Should he achieve anything approaching Giggs' illustrious career, it would represent an outstanding success - the Welsh legend featured in over 900 matches for Manchester United, recording 168 goals and 270 assists.",
      "When questioned after the match about managing Estevao's minutes, and whether it becomes more challenging to limit his game-time given such performances, Maresca replied: \"No, to be honest. Because, for when he doesn't play, Pedro Neto plays wide in his position.",
      "\"And Pedro is good. And we're happy with Pedro. We try just to defend the game plan, we use 11 players. Tonight, we decided, probably in the most difficult game of the season, we decided to play with Estevao.",
      "\"So I'm not a manager that I don't allow players to play minutes. It's just the game-plan. The game-plan always decides the first XI. It's the reason why we changed so much.",
      "\"And you say that we are unpredictable. But it's the game-plan. The game-plan defines the first 11. Now, the next one is Arsenal. The game-plan is not always good, sometimes it's also wrong.",
      "\"It defines the first XI. And Estevao, when the game plan is for him, he's going to play. And for sure he's going to play many games because he's very good.\"",

      "Kai Rooney could finally follow in his dad's footsteps by debuting at Old Trafford next month. The 15-year-old son of Manchester United legend Wayne Rooney has been turning heads at academy level, showcasing his skills both as a centre-forward and on the wing.",
      "However, due to his age, he hasn't yet had the chance to play on the hallowed turf of the Theatre of Dreams. This could all change come December, when Darren Fletcher's Under-18s squad face off against Peterborough United in the third round of the FA Youth Cup.",
      "Last season, the team were denied the opportunity to play at Old Trafford in the fifth round of the competition, with Sir Jim Ratcliffe and Ineos looking to cut costs across the board, according to the Daily Mail. Instead, the match was held at Leigh Sports Village.",
      "Rooney is currently nearing the end of his recovery from an injury that has kept him out of action for most of the season. He managed just two appearances this term before suffering the setback in September.",
      "In recent months, he has hinted at a successful recovery and has even returned to training on grass. However, it remains to be seen whether he will be fully fit in time for next month's clash.",
      "Unfortunately, his father, Wayne, may not be able to watch him make his debut at the Stretford End. It has recently emerged that Manchester United and England legend is unable to attend his son's football matches due to his own fame.",
      "During her time on ITV's I'm A Celebrity...Get Me Out Of Here! last year, Wayne's wife, Coleen, revealed: \"That's the thing with kids I think, it's hard to go on days out. Kai told Wayne to stop coming to football games, when he played grassroots tournaments and stuff because he used to get swarmed and he couldn't even watch the game.",
      "\"How do you say to all of these kids, 'Go away, I'm watching my son?' Adults, it's different you could speak to them, so he [Kai] just said, 'Oh, dad there's no point you coming because you don't even watch me play anyway.'",
      "\"Which is sad, but it can't be helped anyway. At the same time, the fans help you along the way and get you where you are.\"",
      "Despite not being able to watch his son compete in person, Wayne has shared that he still plays a significant role in his son's development by offering advice at home. Speaking on The Wayne Rooney Show last month, the 40-year-old explained: \"I'm quite lucky where I live as I've got a little pitch there and when the kids say, 'We're coming on the pitch', all they're gonna do is tie the balls on the top corner.",
      "\"So when I say to them when I was younger, I remember setting a little square to practice passing into it and just playing off the wall. So I'm very similar, [I tell them] 'You need to work on your speed, you need to work on your technique and control.' Otherwise, you go out and you're just like, 'Watch me hit the ball in the top corner.'\".",
      "Speaking about his son's development, he added: \"He's just playing, he's a 15-year-old boy playing his football, enjoying it. Of course he gets different attention to a lot of his team-mates but I think he handles that really well.\"",

      "The Reds have been linked with several players ahead of the January transfer window, which opens in the New Year.",
      "Joao Gomes, Carlos Baleba and Zeki Celik are among the latest names under consideration for a move to Old Trafford. With December approaching, Ruben Amorim is set to lose Bryan Mbeumo, Noussair Mazraoui and Amad to the Africa Cup of Nations.",
      "Their absence could increase the urgency for United to strengthen in the upcoming window. On the field, United's five-game Premier League unbeaten run came to an end with a narrow 1-0 defeat to ten-man Everton on Monday.",
      "Amorim will now be aiming to restore momentum when his side travel to Selhurst Park to face Crystal Palace this weekend. Elsewhere, Marcus Rashford is on loan at Barcelona, who hold an option to make the move permanent at the end of the season.",
      "Rasmus Hojlund has joined Napoli on a temporary deal that includes a conditional obligation to buy for £38 million. Follow all the latest Man United news and transfer rumours with the MEN throughout the day.",
      "Manchester United continue to be linked with possible options to improve their midfield ranks, but the presence of Bastian Schweinsteiger could well cause an issue with one particular target for Ruben Amorim.",
      "It comes as the side face some questions over the future of their central options within the squad, with Casemiro's contract expiring in 2026. On top of that, there are question marks over how much influence Kobbie Mainoo and Manuel Ugarte could have in the role as one of the two pivots.",
      "That has naturally created some talk over possible transfer targets, with Brighton's Carlos Baleba, Nottingham Forest's Elliot Anderson and Crystal Palace's Adam Wharton among those heavily linked with moves to United. He isn't the only one, however, as VFB Stuttgart's Angelo Stiller has emerged as a top target who could be more affordable for the club in the next few months.",
      "Brighton and Hove Albion head coach Fabian Hurzeler has insisted talk surrounding Carlos Baleba and a transfer to Manchester United needs to end as the midfielder searches to regain his form. United looked at Baleba in the summer transfer window, but after being told Brighton's asking price was £100million the Reds agreed to delay their pursuit until next summer.",
      "Since then, the Cameroonian has struggled for form and he did not impress during Brighton's visit to Old Trafford in October as United won 4-2. The 21-year-old was a topic of conversation in Hurzeler's press conference on Thursday morning after he was substituted at half-time in the 2-1 victory over Brentford. Brighton's manager insisted that talk of Baleba leaving for United must now end as he looks to get his season back on track.",
      "Manchester United will reportedly look to strengthen their options at wing-back and midfield next summer, though movements in upcoming transfer window have not been ruled out. According to ESPN, United are likely to approach January with caution.",
      "It was a busy summer for the club with five new additions to Ruben Amorim's squad and there already is speculation that more players could be signed soon. Benjamin Sesko, Bryan Mbeumo, Matheus Cunha, Senne Lammens, and Diego Leon all moved to Old Trafford during the summer transfer window costing the club £236million.",
      "Brighton & Hove Albion's midfielder Carlos Baleba was also heavily linked but a transfer did not come to fruition. ESPN note that alongside Baleba, Elliot Anderson and Adam Wharton are among the names in the frame as midfield targets. United have also reportedly explored moves for Wolves duo Joao Gomes and Andre, as well as Angelo Stiller and Conor Gallagher.",
      "Manchester United are set to appoint Kyle Macaulay as head of senior scouting. It is understood Macaulay has been identified as the right person for the job after a four-month search to fill the vacancy.",
      "Christopher Vivell and Macaulay worked together at Chelsea between 2022 and 2023, the former as technical director and the latter as head of scouting while Graham Potter was at the helm. Macaulay has also worked with Potter at Ostersunds, Swansea City, Brighton and West Ham.",
      "With this being such a key role in United's recruitment set-up, Macaulay will be expected to hit the ground running when he starts his new job. The January transfer window is on the horizon and plans will already be in the works for next summer's window.",
      "Former Manchester United star Lee Sharpe believes a new left wing-back could be on the club's radar in the January transfer window. Last January, the Reds decided to splash the cash to bring Patrick Dorgu to Old Trafford after Ruben Amorim identified the left wing-back role as a position in need of strengthening.",
      "While Dorgu continues to adapt to the Premier League, he has struggled to hold down the position ahead of Diogo Dalot. The Portuguese full-back looks more comfortable on the right but due to Amad's good form has been moved to the left. With neither man quite doing enough to make the position their own, Adventure Games ambassador Sharpe explained to MEN Sport why he feels this is where the Reds could strengthen.",
      "Cunha has received the backing of Brazilian legend Robert Carlos to lead his nation at the World Cup.",
      "\"I like Matheus Cunha. Joao Pedro is still very young. European football is helping Pedro develop,\" he said. \"But in my opinion, Matheus Cunha is a better player today. I think with Neymar is doing well, Vinicius is doing well.",
      "\"Rodrygo, Matheus Cunha, Richarlison, Joao Pedro, Estevao, Brazil has a lot of players. They just need to adapt without the ball. With the ball, they have a lot of quality, but without the ball, that’s a big problem. But I think little by little, Brazil is improving to reach the World Cup and at least be able to play in the final since R9 retired.\"",
      "Although Manchester United have tended to struggle without Casemiro on the pitch this season, Ruben Amorim was happy to hook him before the hour mark against Everton on Monday.",
      "Casemiro started poorly and didn't make a single tackle during his 58-minute appearance. He looked like a 33-year-old, and the display was a reminder of why he shouldn't be given a contract extension. The fact that there has even been a conversation about whether Casemiro merits an extension (his current deal expires in June) is a credit to himself, but it would be a mistake to keep him beyond this season.",

      "Stiller spent 11 years at Bayern, progressing through the youth academy and Bayern Munich II. During that time, he made three first-team appearances before moving on to Hoffenheim and later Stuttgart in 2023.",

      "Here, MEN Sport has taken a look at the three positions in the team that should be on Macaulay's radar.",
      "According to BILD, Serhou Guirassy has a release clause in his contract specifying certain clubs that would be able to activate his release clause.",
      "Man United, Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester City, Real Madrid and Barcelona are reportedly included, though the transfer fee for any of those sides would be significantly higher.",
      "Another possible scenario is a lucrative offer from Saudi Arabia.",
      "Manchester United star Patrick Dorgu has liked a post on Instagram slamming Ruben Amorim's use of midfielders Casemiro and Bruno Fernandes.",
      "One of the staples of United's tactical structure this season has been a midfield pivot of captain Fernandes and Casemiro. The pair started the 1-0 loss against the Toffees on Monday night, before the latter was substituted for Kobbie Mainoo just before the hour mark.",
      "However, it appears the manager's use of players in the current system isn't universally accepted within the dressing room. Dorgu liked a recent post on Instagram claiming that Fernandes and Casemiro cannot and should not play alongside each other.",
      "A post shared by the handle \"mufcunion\" included a screenshot taken from X which stated: \"Any coach that sees Casemiro and Bruno Fernandes as a viable pivot is one that isn't serious.\" The Instagram post was captioned: \"Bruno Fernandes and Casemiro CANNOT play together,\" and was liked by Dorgu, who signed for the Manchester club from Lecce for a fee of £25m earlier this year. The wing-back has made 12 appearances across all competitions this term, registering one assist in that time.",
      "Former Man United man Antony has revealed he couldn't sleep after receiving a red card for kicking the opposition player in the face.",
      "Antony said: \"I had no intention. That’s why we’re going to try to appeal. I won the body. When I did the [overhead] there, I didn't see it, I was looking at the ball.",
      "\"It was the VAR decision, the referee knows that I had no intention. It was very hard to sleep. I stayed at home thinking all night, I slept very little.\"",
      "The winger left Man United for Real Betis in the summer following a disastrous spell at Old Trafford.",
      "Brighton and Hove Albion head coach Fabian Hurzeler has insisted talk surrounding Baleba and a transfer to United needs to end as the midfielder searches to regain his form.",
      "United looked at Baleba in the summer transfer window, but after being told Brighton's asking price was £100million the Reds agreed to delay their pursuit until next summer.",
      "When asked specifically about the United rumours, Fabian Hurzeler said: \"I think it has gone now. We are now four months into the season so we can’t speak about these rumours any more.",
      "\"It’s about being a Brighton player, it’s about performing well here and it is about getting him back to his best level. Avoid the noise, avoid all the rumours and focus on the things you can influence and the things you can do best and that’s football.\"",
      "Man United are reportedly keen to sign centre-back Jeremy Jacquet from Rennes.",
      "Daily Briefing claim United have been monitoring the 20-year-old, who is regarded as one of the most promising defenders in Ligue 1. However, they face competition from Chelsea, Tottenham, Crystal Palace and RB Leipzig.",
      "United have reportedly scouted the youngster and were left 'impressed.' It's said that his price tag shouldn't exceed £35million.",
      "Swedish outlet Expressen has relayed quotes from Malmo FF goalkeeper Melker Ellborg on the interest from Man United.",
      "Reports in Sweden claimed that United have been scouting him live in action. \"It came a bit out of nowhere but of course it's fun to be on those clubs' radar. It's awesome,\" Ellborg said.",
      "\"But for now, a rumour is just a rumour. As long as there’s nothing concrete, it’s not something I focus on. The deal between me and my advisors is that I get on with it and focus on my own. They take care of the rest.\"",
      "Wolves star Joao Gomes is continuing to be linked with a move to United ahead of the January transfer window. United have been heavily linked with going back into the market for a midfielder since this summer.",
      "The Brazilian is reported to be valued at around £44million by the Molineux outfit, who have new manager Rob Edwards at the helm following the departure of Vitor Pereira.",

      "There was a bizarre situation last weekend when Matheus Cunha was forced to miss an appearance to switch on Christmas lights in Altrincham. The organisers of the event posted on social media to say Cunha had pulled out due to “medical reasons.”",
      "Manchester United sources confirmed Cunha had suffered a knock in training. The issue was described as minor, but it was serious enough for him miss the Everton game on Monday. Amorim was asked to clarify the situation ahead of the clash with the Toffees, telling MUTV: \"It was a knock in training so I don’t know how long he’s going to stay out, I think it’s nothing serious.\"",
      "In a separate interview with NBC, Amorim said: “Let’s recover Cunha, and we’ll see if he will be ready for the next game.\" The Reds are next in action against Crystal Palace at Selhurst Park and the expectation is that Cunha will return to the squad, which is a boost after a shocking defeat against Everton.",
      "Everton had 10 men on the pitch for 77 minutes and United could not score. They struggled to create clear-cut opportunities and the few chances that were carved out landed to Zirkzee in the box. Zirkzee is not good enough to be starting for United in the Premier League, and fans will be desperately hoping for a positive update on Cunha ahead of this weekend.",
      "Palace have the second-best defensive record in the top flight this season, with only Arsenal conceding fewer goals (six) than Oliver Glasner's side (9), who are sitting fifth in the table. Glasner has done a magnificent job since his appointment in Croydon. Palace will be hard to break down on Sunday, and Cunha has the quality to create chances or find the back of the net himself.",
      "It would be a boost for Harry Maguire to return to the squad, which will depend on whether the England international has recovered from the hamstring injury he suffered before the international break.",
      "Everton dominated aerial duels at Old Trafford earlier in the week and Maguire's presence at the back was missed. If Maguire passes a fitness test this week, he should come into the starting team for Leny Yoro.",
      "Yoro struggled against Everton. He was culpable in the build-up to Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall's goal from the edge of the box, failing to commit to the challenge, which allowed the Everton man to shoot.",
      "Maguire would have played himself back into the England squad by now if not for picking up a few minor injuries, and Amorim will give an update on his recovery at his press conference on Friday afternoon.",
      "The potential returns of Cunha and Maguire feel crucial for Amorim to pick his strongest possible XI this weekend. United started November with draws against Nottingham Forest and Tottenham, and fingers will be pointed at Amorim again if they end the month with back-to-back defeats.",
      "Amorim was named Premier League manager of the month for October and November was an opportunity to build further momentum ahead of the winter schedule, so the Palace clash is another big fixture.",
      "Mason Mount deserves a recall to the team and Diogo Dalot will likely start in the left wing-back role because Patrick Dorgu had another performance to forget against Everton. Dalot and Dorgu have both been unconvincing on the left this season and United need a new signing for that position.",
      "Strongest XI to face Palace: Lammens, De Ligt, Maguire, Shaw, Amad, Dalot, Casemiro, Fernandes, Mbeumo, Mount, Cunha.",

      "Manchester United are set to appoint Kyle Macaulay as head of senior scouting. It is understood Macaulay has been identified as the right person for the job after a four-month search to fill the vacancy.",
      "Christopher Vivell and Macaulay worked together at Chelsea between 2022 and 2023, the former as technical director and the latter as head of scouting while Graham Potter was at the helm. Macaulay has also worked with Potter at Ostersunds, Swansea City, Brighton and West Ham.",
      "With this being such a key role in United's recruitment set-up, Macaulay will be expected to hit the ground running when he starts his new job. The January transfer window is on the horizon and plans will already be in the works for next summer's window.",
      "MEN Sport has taken a look at the three positions in the team that should be on Macaulay's radar.",
      "New left wing-back",
      "Wing-backs are crucial in Amorim's system. On the right, United have Amad performing well and while defensively he can improve, he is the kind of outlet Amorim's system needs.",
      "The left is more of an issue. Patrick Dorgu has potential but he is still raw and his decision-making in the final third leaves a lot to be desired. Diogo Dalot and Noussair Mazraoui just don't look comfortable as left wing-backs.",
      "Diego Leon was signed in the summer but he is still raw and getting a feel for European football. Macaulay should be tasked with finding a new left wing-back to strengthen that position.",
      "Further attacking reinforcements",
      "Joshua Zirkzee started on Monday night against Everton but he showed he isn't the centre-forward the club need. Zirkzee is better as a No.10 and so Benjamin Sesko is the only out-and-out striker at the club.",
      "The Reds had success with the strikerless system when Matheus Cunha led the line, but there needs to be another centre-forward at the club to provide competition for Sesko.",
      "Midfield overhaul",
      "Even if Casemiro stays at Old Trafford beyond this season, a new central midfielder is needed. Kobbie Mainoo's future at the club is unclear and Manuel Ugarte is still struggling to find his feet after over a year in English football.",
      "Bruno Fernandes needs a partner in the middle and with Casemiro set to turn 34 before the end of the season, United would be wise to sign a new defensive midfielder. Plans for who United will target in the summer will already be being drawn up but Macaulay could still have his say.",

      "What makes a successful Manchester United team? That is the question which is undoubtedly spinning around the mind of Ruben Amorim this week after a disappointing defeat to Everton on Monday night. In the short-term, the answer seems simple.",
      "United need to purchase players who are going to drastically improve what they are currently offering. They started this approach in the summer with Bryan Mbeumo proving to be much better than those previously occupying the attack. The jury is still out on Benjamin Sesko and Matheus Cunha, albeit they have both had their moments.",
      "Meanwhile, Senne Lammens has been a revelation in goal. Even with his mistake this week, the Belgian has been a vast improvement on Altay Bayindir and Andre Onana. This transfer strategy is one which United will be looking to adopt moving forward but long-term, there needs to be a culture shift at Old Trafford.",
      "For too long there has been a sense of negativity around the club and a concern that too many players are here for the wage packet rather than to take the Reds back to the top. Amorim has worked hard to shape the club in an image which best suits his own.",
      "But changing the culture needs to be spearheaded by the players. And Amorim may find it difficult to replace one key man at the club. Speaking on the Inside Carrington podcast, Lammens was asked by Ben Foster who his 'big brother' was in the squad.",
      "He replied: \"Tom Heaton is the easy answer for me. Just the type of human he is with all the experience and making me feel at home as well. To be honest, the whole goalkeeping group is really good together.\"",
      "Third choice goalkeeper Heaton is out of contract at the end of this season and there is a feeling he may choose to retire this summer. But Lammens' comments are just further evidence of how difficult it will be to replace someone like Heaton in the dressing room.",
      "\"He (Amorim) feels quite strongly about having a group of players that have a strong influence on the dressing room and provides a little bit of support to Bruno [Fernandes],\" Heaton said of the role in August. \"I am obviously honoured as ever to be part of that and will try to have as much influence on it as I possibly can.\"",
      "Heaton is popular in the dressing room and is clearly a big help to Amorim and his staff. Amorim will have no shortage of options for the role if the 39-year-old does depart in the summer. It is about finding the right fit and personality for the dressing room who can use his experience, not only to help his fellow goalkeepers, but to create the perfect culture for success.",
      "Heaton does that role well as evidenced by Lammens' comments so United will need to be careful when it comes to finding a replacement.",

      "Brighton and Hove Albion head coach Fabian Hurzeler has insisted talk surrounding Carlos Baleba and a transfer to Manchester United needs to end as the midfielder searches to regain his form. United looked at Baleba in the summer transfer window, but after being told Brighton's asking price was £100million the Reds agreed to delay their pursuit until next summer.",
      "Since then, the Cameroonian has struggled for form and he did not impress during Brighton's visit to Old Trafford in October as United won 4-2. The 21-year-old was a topic of conversation in Hurzeler's press conference on Thursday morning after he was substituted at half-time in the 2-1 victory over Brentford. Brighton's manager insisted that talk of Baleba leaving for United must now end as he looks to get his season back on track.",
      "\"I think it is a constant thing that we try to do extra work with him,\" he said. \"Every player we try to develop, no matter if he is playing or not, every player we try to get back to his full potential and that is what we try to do, step by step, without putting these kinds of players under pressure.",
      "\"Don’t put Carlos Baleba under pressure and say ‘you must play well’ because of course he wants to play well. It is about the small steps. It is about how he asks for the ball, the positioning he has when he receives the ball. How often he is switched on in trying to react when we lose the ball.",
      "\"These are all kinds of things he can influence and then we try to work with him. Sometimes you need to be patient. Sometimes you need to be more demanding, more ruthless with the players but, overall, you always need to create the right environment and the right supporters around him to give him the right help.\"",
      "When asked specifically about the United rumours, Hurzeler added: \"I think it has gone now. We are now four months into the season so we can’t speak about these rumours any more.",
      "\"It’s about being a Brighton player, it’s about performing well here and it is about getting him back to his best level. Avoid the noise, avoid all the rumours and focus on the things you can influence and the things you can do best and that’s football.\"",

      "Ruben Amorim has been under pressure during his tenure so far, which recently hit the one-year mark, though some recent results have eased that somewhat.",
      "A run of three successive wins in the Premier League, which turned into five unbeaten, hinted towards the possibility of the side kicking on - though a recent defeat to ten-men Everton raised some further concerns.",
      "While the jury is still out on whether Amorim will succeed at Man United, a decision over his future may have to be made sooner rather than later, all because of their rivals, Liverpool.",
      "The Merseyside outfit have been on a wretched run of form, losing nine of their last 12 games across all competitions, the latest of which was a 4-1 thrashing at the hands of PSV Eindhoven.",
      "That has now put some pressure on Arne Slot, with the possibility of a sacking not out of the question, as performances and results fall short of expectations - especially after spending £450m in the summer transfer window.",
      "While that may well be to the delight of United fans, there could be a huge impact on the club in Liverpool making a change to their managerial ranks.",
      "That's because Oliver Glasner has shot up to second-favourite for the job at Anfield after an impressive few seasons at Crystal Palace.",
      "Glasner has been linked with Man United as a possible option if they ever decide to part ways with Amorim, with his system seemingly suiting the move to Old Trafford, given how the squad has been built around a back three.",
      "However, there is no doubt that the Austrian boss would be on the radar at Liverpool if they want to make a change, given his calm and collected manner and the way he has managed to get the Eagles playing.",
      "That could well push the United hierarchy into making a move sooner rather than later, if they do decide that Glasner is the option to take them forward, or if they have any lingering doubts over Amorim.",
      "United are content with Amorim at the moment, with Sir Jim Ratcliffe recently hinting that he's prepared to give the Portuguese boss three years to prove he is the right man for the job.",
      "However, football is a results business, and if United start to falter again, Ratcliffe's commitment to Amorim will be tested.",
      "One other thing that maybe should be considered is how the manager could help United grab two transfer targets, with Adam Wharton and Jean-Philippe Mateta on the club's radar, who have impressed under the 51-year-old.",
      "Glasner has taken charge of 81 games with Crystal Palace, guiding them to FA Cup and Community Shield glory, as well as a first foray into Europe.",
      "In those 81 matches in the dugout, Glasner has won 40 games with 23 draws and 18 defeats, making the side incredibly hard to beat.",
      "Whether that would translate well to either Man United or Liverpool remains to be seen, however, both teams will have their resolve tested over their management situations over the coming weeks.",

      "Former Manchester United star Lee Sharpe believes a new left wing-back could be on the club's radar in the January transfer window. Last January, the Reds decided to splash the cash to bring Patrick Dorgu to Old Trafford after Ruben Amorim identified the left wing-back role as a position in need of strengthening.",
      "While Dorgu continues to adapt to the Premier League, he has struggled to hold down the position ahead of Diogo Dalot. The Portuguese full-back looks more comfortable on the right but due to Amad's good form has been moved to the left. With neither man quite doing enough to make the position their own, Adventure Games ambassador Sharpe explained to MEN Sport why he feels this is where the Reds could strengthen.",
      "He said: \"It is a difficult one really because I think in the main they are playing pretty well. [Bryan] Mbeumo and [Matheus] Cunha have been fantastic.",
      "\"Defensively they have an abundance of defenders. Maybe a left wing-back to help cover Dorgu. He has been up and down in form recently but once he gets up to speed after a couple of injuries and a lack of form, I think he is going to be a really good player.\"",
      "United have seen a shift in their recruitment strategy since the arrival of Sir Jim Ratcliffe. The Ineos founder, of course, is in charge of football operations at Old Trafford and Sharpe feels the jury remains out on the British billionaire.",
      "He added: \"You would probably put him [Ratcliffe] in the same category as the manager - I think he has been a little bit indifferent with some of the decisions he has made. Waiting and spending a lot of money bringing Dan Ashworth in and then getting rid of him pretty sharpish, giving [Erik] Ten Hag a new contract and then getting rid of him pretty sharpish. The staff cuts, money cuts, not giving staff tickets for the [FA] Cup final and stuff like that, there are questionable decisions that he has made.",
      "\"But again, you have got to see the positives. They have gone out and got Mbeumo, Cunha, [Senne] Lammens. They have strengthened in the areas that they needed to strengthen in. We are creating more chances, playing better football, so things are coming good and you have to say that is partly down to him. As well as making a few mistakes, he has done a few good things as well.\"",

      "Ruben Amorim has rejected the idea that he is \"fixated\" with his tactics at Manchester United, while confirming that he is \"willing\" to tweak the team's approach to win games. Amorim has steadfastly stood by his 3-4-3 formation since his appointment from Sporting Lisbon, saying that not even the Pope could persuade him to change United's tactical system.",
      "The formation has been contentious, but Amorim was named Premier League manager of the month in October after overseeing wins against Sunderland, Liverpool and Brighton, which silenced speculation about his future. United have started November with two draws and a defeat to Everton, who claimed three points at Old Trafford, despite playing for 77 minutes with just 10 men due to a sending off.",
      "Amorim was accused of being stubborn against Everton, but he has insisted he is adaptable. DAZN Portugal has launched a new Q&A segment on YouTube, where fans have the opportunity to ask questions to the \"biggest Portuguese figures in world football\", and Amorim was the first guest.",
      "Amorim was asked whether he would return to he \"mobile attacking style\" he implemented at Sporting, where there was no fixed striker and the front line would constantly rotate. Although Viktor Gyokeres was the first choice striker during Amorim's time at Sporting, the shape was built around rotations, with Gyokeres asked to drift wide, link play and drop deep.",
      "The 40-year-old said United have already played with a fluid attack this season and, interestingly, said that he was \"willing\" to try new tactics, despite critics thinking he is \"fixated.\"",
      "Amorim said: \"We did it against Liverpool, it wasn't with Bryan Mbeumo, it was with Cunha. And it's an option that we have, and nowadays, everyone, I think not only in the English league but in the Portuguese league, in all leagues, there's a great variation in how things are structured.",
      "\"We might say it’s a 4-4-2, but five minutes later it’s a 4-3-3 or a 3-4-3. And therefore I'm willing to do anything, contrary to what many people think that I'm too fixated on one thing.",
      "\"I simply start with a basic foundation, but obviously, we can use it in the future. And we've already thought about that with Bryan [playing central] because he's very strong in transitions.",
      "\"I do think it's the best position for him [out wide] because he likes to be hidden, he doesn't like people watching him. He can attack, be more dangerous on one of the flanks, either the right or the left, rather than as a striker, but it's a good option, therefore I'll be able to use it in the future as I did several times at Sporting.\"",
      "Amorim has regularly insisted his system is not a problem. Speaking earlier this year, he said: \"The problem of our team is not the system. We have a lot of problems, we are trying to work on these problems, of course every system needs different characteristics. But I was always really clear. I have one idea.",
      "\"I am still really confident because I have an idea how to play football. I will not change that, no matter what. And I’m not talking about the system, it’s the way I see football, I will not change that.\"",

      "Although Manchester United have tended to struggle without Casemiro on the pitch this season, Ruben Amorim was happy to hook him before the hour mark against Everton on Monday. Casemiro started poorly and didn't make a single tackle during his 58-minute appearance.",
      "He looked like a 33-year-old, and the display was a reminder of why he shouldn't be given a contract extension. The fact that there has even been a conversation about whether Casemiro merits an extension (his current deal expires in June) is a credit to himself, but it would be a mistake to keep him beyond this season.",
      "It's been great to see Casemiro make such a strong start to the campaign, but there were always doubts about how long he could sustain that level. After all, he has entered the winter of his career so it seemed unlikely he would be able to perform like that for the entire season.",
      "Casemiro's performance against Everton was the kind of display expected from someone of his age. He looked pedestrian and struggled with Everton's physicality before the red card. There are bound to be more performances like that from Casemiro before the end of the campaign. And of course, there should be some more strong displays produced as well, but the point is that United need someone in that position who can deliver every week. They need someone younger.",
      "Casemiro will celebrate his 34th birthday in February, and he is the highest earner in the dressing room, so United would make an Ed Woodward-esque decision by extending his deal. Those who have argued for Casemiro's contract to be extended have said he should be kept on reduced terms and given a back-up role, but this is a player who has won five Champions League trophies.",
      "It seems unlikely Casemiro would accept a huge pay cut to sit on the bench in Manchester when the option of playing in his homeland - and still starting each game - could be on the table. Regardless, the option should be taken out of his hands. United need to move on and sign a replacement.",
      "There was another contract lesson to be taken from the performance against Everton because Harry Maguire's absence was felt at the back. Thierno Barry won 14 aerial duels, the most by a player in a Premier League game this season, which wouldn't have happened with Maguire on the pitch.",
      "Leny Yoro is an exciting prospect for the future, but he lacked aggression in several instances against Everton, and Maguire would have been the better choice had he been available.",
      "Everton are a physical side and dominated aerial duels. United are guaranteed to be dragged into battles like that on a few occasions across a season, and Maguire is indispensable in those scenarios.",
      "Maguire is out of contract at the end of the season, but it's logical for United to try to extend his stay at Old Trafford, provided he is happy to take a slight pay cut to continue at the club.",
      "The England international does not earn as much as Casemiro, which should make it easier for a compromise to be reached between both parties, while his role in the squad wouldn't change much.",
      "Set-pieces have become important again in the Premier League over the last two seasons and losing Maguire, who is more often than not imperious in the air, would be a huge blow.",
      "Amorim recently said about Maguire's future: \"We are really happy with Harry. It is not the time to talk about that again because that gives the idea that we are thinking so far away. We are really happy with Harry. He is a really important for us, but we need to focus on the next game.\"",
      "The United boss was asked whether he was pleased with Maguire's renaissance and said: \"Yes. I think it was good for him to play with the three centre-backs. I think he feels more comfortable.",
      "\"He doesn't need to go to the side so much. Sometimes, you help some players with the way you play. Sometimes, it is the opposite with some players. I am really pleased. I think he is not young, but he can learn a lot. He can improve. I think he can be so much better with the ball because he has that quality.",
      "\"He needs to show that. Nowadays, with the set-pieces that you see, the amount of men that you put in the box, every cross from the opponent, everyone is playing the pass.\"",
      "Maguire's stock rose without him playing against Everton, while Casemiro's didn't do himself any favours.",

      "Manchester United will reportedly look to strengthen their options at wing-back and midfield next summer, though movements in upcoming transfer window have not been ruled out. According to ESPN, United are likely to approach January with caution.",
      "It was a busy summer for the club with five new additions to Ruben Amorim's squad and there already is speculation that more players could be signed soon. Benjamin Sesko, Bryan Mbeumo, Matheus Cunha, Senne Lammens, and Diego Leon all moved to Old Trafford during the summer transfer window costing the club £236million.",
      "Brighton & Hove Albion's midfielder Carlos Baleba was also heavily linked but a transfer did not come to fruition. ESPN note that alongside Baleba, Elliot Anderson and Adam Wharton are among the names in the frame as midfield targets.",
      "United have also reportedly explored moves for Wolves duo Joao Gomes and Andre, as well as Angelo Stiller and Conor Gallagher.",
      "They claim that the Reds' recruitment plan next summer is believed to revolve around bringing in 'at least one' top-level midfielder.",
      "With that said, Manuel Ugarte has yet to convince as United's first-choice defensive midfielder.",
      "While some movement could be expected in January and ESPN report that 'nothing has been ruled out,' the bulk of their transfer business is expected to be left until next summer.",
      "Next month, Amorim will temporarily be without Bryan Mbeumo, Amad and Noussair Mazraoui due to their involvement in the Africa Cup of Nations while Sesko is currently recovering from a knee injury he suffered against Tottenham.",
      "Meanwhile, the futures of Marcus Rashford and Jadon Sancho, two of the club's highest earners, are expected to be away from Old Trafford.",

      "Manchester United star Patrick Dorgu has liked a post on Instagram slamming Ruben Amorim's use of midfielders Casemiro and Bruno Fernandes.",
      "It's been a mixed start to the campaign for the Red Devils, who sit 10th in the Premier League with five wins from 12 games so far. Despite big wins against the likes of Liverpool at Anfield, the latest loss against Everton at Old Trafford has taken the wind out of their sails.",
      "One of the staples of United's tactical structure this season has been a midfield pivot of captain Fernandes and Casemiro. The pair started the 1-0 loss against the Toffees on Monday night, before the latter was substituted for Kobbie Mainoo just before the hour mark.",
      "However, it appears the manager's use of players in the current system isn't universally accepted within the dressing room. Dorgu liked a recent post on Instagram claiming that Fernandes and Casemiro cannot and should not play alongside each other.",
      "A post shared by the handle \"mufcunion\" included a screenshot taken from X which stated: \"Any coach that sees Casemiro and Bruno Fernandes as a viable pivot is one that isn't serious.\"",
      "The Instagram post was captioned: \"Bruno Fernandes and Casemiro CANNOT play together,\" and was liked by Dorgu, who signed for the Manchester club from Lecce for a fee of £25m earlier this year. The wing-back has made 12 appearances across all competitions this term, registering one assist in that time.",
      "Fernandes and Casemiro have started alongside each other in 10 of United's 13 games across all competitions so far this season. The only exceptions have been a heavily rotated side against Grimsby Town in the Carabao Cup second round, as well as two league games against Brentford and Manchester City.",
      "In Casemiro's place, Manuel Ugarte has started alongside Fernandes in those matches. However, the Brentford selection was enforced, given Casemiro had received a red card in the game prior against Chelsea.",
      "The Brazilian faces something of an uncertain future at Old Trafford as his contract enters its latter stages. The 33-year-old has certainly had a better season so far compared to last, but it is not yet clear whether he will extend his stay at United beyond his current deal.",
      "As a result, United were heavily linked with midfield reinforcements over the summer - most notably Brighton's Carlos Baleba - while Nottingham Forest's Elliot Anderson is the latest name to dominate headlines ahead of the January transfer window.",
      "That said, such social media activity is certainly not a good look for Dorgu, the manager or his team-mates. Especially when it involves a post heavily critical of the manager's selection decisions."

      "Manchester United continue to be linked with possible options to improve their midfield ranks, but the presence of Bastian Schweinsteiger could well cause an issue with one particular target for Ruben Amorim.",
      "It comes as the side face some questions over the future of their central options within the squad, with Casemiro's contract expiring in 2026.",
      "On top of that, there are question marks over how much influence Kobbie Mainoo and Manuel Ugarte could have in the role as one of the two pivots.",
      "That has naturally created some talk over possible transfer targets, with Brighton's Carlos Baleba, Nottingham Forest's Elliot Anderson and Crystal Palace's Adam Wharton among those heavily linked with moves to United.",
      "He isn't the only one, however, as VFB Stuttgart's Angelo Stiller has emerged as a top target who could be more affordable for the club in the next few months.",
      "The 24-year-old has been a consistent presence for the Bundesliga team, with 18 appearances across all competitions, scoring once and assisting five times in that spell.",
      "It's no surprise that Stiller continues to be linked as an option, but it's not only United who are keeping tabs on his availability for the coming transfer windows, as Bayern Munich appear to be interested as well.",
      "With that in mind, former United midfielder Bastian Schweinsteiger has urged the German international to make a move to Bavaria, over a switch to the Premier League, if the opportunity arises.",
      "Speaking at a King's League event, the 41-year-old said: \"Angelo is a very interesting player. I would very much like to see him back at FC Bayern.\"",
      "Stiller came through the ranks with Bayern Munich, spending 11 years with the club in their academy, while he also made three appearances for the senior team, before his eventual departure.",
      "With Schweinsteiger having played for both Bayern and United in his impressive career, he may be able to give a little insight into the culture surrounding both clubs, which may help inform Stiller of a move, one way or the other.",
      "The former midfielder enjoyed a 13-year stint in the Bundesliga before he made the switch to the Premier League, though his time with United was different to that of Bayern.",
      "Schweinsteiger lasted just 20 months at Old Trafford, falling out of favour before his exit to Chicago Fire in 2017, having been seen as surplus to requirements.",
      "The World Cup winner explained how he was banished from training with the team during his time when speaking on Stick To Football last year.",
      "He said: \"I was training alone for at least three months with a fitness coach. I trained before and after the (first) team.",
      "\"(Mourinho) never let me train with the first team. I guess they wanted to get rid of me. In that moment, I was still super happy at United. I loved to wear the jersey; I loved it.",
      "\"I was thinking that maybe it was just a period, I will train now and keep myself fit, and maybe one day they'll change their mind. My dream was to always step back out into Old Trafford.\"",
      "In the end, it was a bitter way for Schweinsteiger to leave, and while Man United seem to hold a special place in his heart, his recent stance could end up hurting them in the transfer market, while Bayern Munich could benefit.",

The Manchester United loannee was absent for their La Liga win over Athletic Club this past weekend because of illness with that also playing a part in Flick's decision.",
      "Even without Rashford, Barca strode to victory back at the Camp Nou for the first time in a few years by scoring four goals while also keeping a clean sheet.",
      "Torres grabbed a brace in that game and Flick therefore rewarded him for that by naming him in the starting XI for their trip to Stamford Bridge",
      "Flick, as quoted by Mundo Deportivo, said: \"Ferran scored two goals on Saturday, and Marcus had been out for three or four days due to his injury, but he’s ready to play at any moment.\"",
      "That latter phrase was confirmed by Flick at half-time with Rashford coming on for Torres, who had missed a great opportunity in the first half, before things unravelled for his side. A Jules Kounde own goal and Ronald Araujo red card saw Barcelona a man and goal down at the interval.",
      "Rashford struggled to get into the game with Chelsea able to extend their lead through a dazzling Estevao Willian strike and clinical Liam Delap finish.",
      "The 28-year-old is unlikely to be judged for his display in west London given the challenging circumstances with Flick a big fan of Rashford as he made perfectly clear when asked about his return to the fold.",
      "He said: \"I'm really very happy [he is back]. We will decide tomorrow [Tuesday] if he plays from the beginning or if he comes in from the bench. But as I said, I'm happy to have him in our team.",
      "\"Last time when we played Newcastle, I also said this. I have followed him, I think, his whole career. I was impressed about him, with his quality, what he is doing in the box, what he is doing in front of goal.",
      "\"He has also showed it in Barcelona, which is really good. But for him, this change to live in another culture. The people in Barcelona are fantastic, we have nice weather. For me, it's amazing.",
      "\"You can see now he is also smiling a lot, and if he can enjoy the atmosphere we have, it is also good for him.\"",
      "The decision to sign him permanently from United is unlikely to be made by Flick but 13 goal contributions this season shows he is putting himself in a great position to have the £26million buy-option in his loan switch activated.",
      "Ruben Amorim could certainly do with Rashford at the moment after his side failed to score against 10-man Everton on Monday evening.",
      "Matheus Cunha and Benjamin Sesko missed the game through injury with the latter set to miss the next few weeks. Bryan Mbeumo will also be absent for a period across the New Year as he competes in AFCON for Cameroon.",

      "Made an excellent challenge at the beginning of the second half and tried to rally his teammates as Everton held onto their one-goal advantage. 5",
      "Noussair Mazraoui",
      "Didn't offer much going forward in the first 45 minutes and was hooked at the interval in a tactical tweak from Amorim. 4",
      "Casemiro",
      "Although Casemiro has become an influential figure again this season he looked like a 33-year-old and was passive. It wasn't a surprise to see him substituted in the 58th minute. 4",
      "Bruno Fernandes",
      "His passing was sloppy at times and he resorted to shooting from distance in an effort to get United back into the contest. Wasted a big chance from close range with 20 minutes remaining. 4",
      "Patrick Dorgu",
      "Looks low on confidence and was poor again at Old Trafford. He missed a decent chance in the first half - his end product must improve - and is likely to be replaced by Dalot at the weekend. 3",
      "Bryan Mbeumo",

      "Amad",
      "Was probably the pick of a bad bunch in the first half. Amad relocated to right wing-back when Mazraoui was brought off and he was still involved in most attacking phases of play. 5",
      "Joshua Zirkzee",
      "The highlight of Zirkzee's first half was his heated exchange with James Tarkowski. The Dutchman made his first start of the campaign and didn't do much until drawing a late save from Pickford. 4",
      "Mason Mount",
      "Made a difference when he came on. 6",
      "Diogo Dalot",
      "An improvement on Dorgu. 5",
      "Kobbie Mainoo",

The Premier League said on the decision: \"The referee’s call of red card to Gueye for violent conduct was checked and confirmed by VAR – with the action deemed to be a clear strike to the face of Keane.\"",

Idrissa Gana Gueye was unhappy with Michael Keane, and he slapped his own teammate in a moment of madness. Gueye was shown a red card and was red in the face as Jordan Pickford held him back.",

Thierno Barry was goalless in 11 league appearances but was given the nod to start, which meant Beto (one goal in 11) was on the bench. However, Iliman Ndiaye looked threatening at times and Jack Grealish was involved on the left.",
      "United started so badly that Gueye's sending off didn't stop Everton from being on the front foot. The travelling Evertonians chirped and erupted when Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall opened the scoring.",
      "\"Hit it,\" shouted the Everton analyst. Leny Yoro didn't commit to the challenge and Lammens should have done better. The goalkeeper's starting position was poor and the shot was saveable.",
      "Kobbie Mainoo and Lisandro Martinez returned to the squad after recovering from their respective injuries, although the latter's return was more significant given the length of his lay-off.",
      "Martinez had been sidelined for nine months with a cruciate ligament injury. It was great to see him back in the squad and he received a warm reception when he emerged to warm up.",
      "There was further applause for youngster Shea Lacey, who was named in a senior squad for the first time, reward for delivering consistently strong performances in academy fixtures. Lacey has a high ceiling and his squad inclusion is expected to be the first of many.",
      "Mani from The Stone Roses sadly passed away this month. United played \"I Want To Be Adored\" as kick-off approached, and \"This Is The One\" carried more meaning as the players walked out.",
      "The first half performance was reminiscent of last season. United must brush teams like Everton aside at home if they want to secure Champions League qualification next season. November started with draws against Nottingham Forest and Tottenham, but Everton was a much bigger setback.",
      "Most of those in red shirts looked disinterested in the first half, and Amorim hooked Noussair Mazraoui at the interval. Mason Mount was introduced and Amad relocated to right wing-back.",
      "Patrick Dorgu had another game to forget and was hauled off before the hour mark. The problem is his replacement, Diogo Dalot, has also been unconvincing from the left this season. The huge cheer for Mainoo as he replaced Casemiro showed what fans think about the handling of him.",
      "Amorim was widely praised after an excellent October, but United have not entered the winter as they would have liked. The games come thick and fast, and they must find another response.",
      "There were joyous scenes in the Everton section at the full-time whistle. Yoro slumped to his knees and Fernandes complained. The United captain should look at himself first after such a poor display.",
      "Moyes claimed an away win at Old Trafford on his 18th attempt. He'll argue it was worth the wait.",

      "The ex-England manager and Premier League legend has teamed up with the Every Minute Matters campaign to offer his services to a Sunday League team for a day.",
      "Big Sam has managed over a thousand games in his career and will come back for one more in a special Mirror Sport competition.",
      "The former Bolton, Newcastle, West Ham, Sunderland and Everton boss will oversee selection, tactics and deliver the pre-match, half-time and full-time talks for one lucky amateur team.",
      "Allardyce is one of the football personalities backing a Sky Bet and British Heart Foundation (BHF) initiative to raise awareness of life-saving CPR amongst everyone in grassroots football",
      "It is part of the pioneering Every Minute Matters campaign – a unique partnership between Sky Bet and BHF and supported by the English Football League - which has already successfully inspired over 350,000 people to start learning CPR since the campaign launched in May 2024.",
      "To have a chance of signing Big Sam for the day, simply send your name, contact details, the name of your team and your league, in the form below. If you can't see the form,  click here.",
      "The winner will be drawn on December 1 and Sam will take charge of a game between January 1 and April 30, 2026.",
      "All entrants need to be part of an adult over 18s men’s or women’s 11-a-side team. Teams from walking football can enter.",
      "Allardyce was inspired to help the Every Minute Matters campaign by the shocking experience suffered by Fabrice Muamba, whose heart stopped beating for a total of 78 minutes after he suffered a cardiac arrest in an FA Cup match at White Hart Lane in 2012.",
      "Allardyce explains: “I can still vividly remember what happened to Fabrice a couple of years after I left Bolton. Thanks to immediate CPR and defibrillation, Fabrice made a full recovery. But most grassroots football teams don’t have a medical team on site, which is why it’s critical anyone who plays amateur football – at any level – knows how to perform CPR and use a defibrillator.",
      "“Too many people still think you have to be a medical professional to step in, but that’s simply not true. Anyone can learn these lifesaving skills and if someone collapses, you need to have the confidence to act. “And that confidence comes from training. That’s why I’m urging everyone in grassroots football to take 15 minutes to learn CPR and defibrillation with the BHF’s brilliant free online tool, RevivR.”",
      "This competition closes at 12pm on the 1st of December 2025."

      "Manchester United legends Paul Scholes and Nicky Butt have revealed how they were once consulted over some potential transfer arrivals to the club in a secret meeting.",
      "The pair claim it happened during a spell when Ryan Giggs was named as the interim manager, which occurred during the 2013/14 season following the dismissal of David Moyes.",
      "At the time, Manchester United were looking to rebuild following the end of the Sir Alex Ferguson era, with plenty of big-name transfers following in an attempt to get the side back in the Premier League title picture.",
      "With that in mind, the executive vice-chairman at the time, Ed Woodward, sought out some help from Scholes and Butt to discuss transfer targets, with a four-man shortlist proposed to the pair.",
      "Speaking on The Good, The Bad & The Football podcast, the United legends were asked about how that meeting with Woodward led to Paul Pogba's return.",
      "Butt responded and said: \"I just remember Ryan [Giggs] took control of the club for four or five or six games at the end of the season... then me and Scholesy did it [the meeting] with him and Phil as well.",
      "\"And I remember obviously they were looking for the right manager to come in and take the job, so they obviously needed targets to go and get in the summer.",
      "\"So I had left the training ground and got called back, and there was a meeting with myself, Scholesy, Ryan, and Ed Woodward, and I think Ed Woodward was on a Zoom call; it wasn't so much face-to-face, I think he was in London, and it was like 'Who would you get?'",
      "\"And he gave us a list of midfielders, I know Pogba was one, Kroos weren't you saying? Fabregas might've been one.\"",
      "Scholes added: \"I think Fabregas might've been one as well, I think even Modric might've been one as well.\"",
      "Butt continued: \"I remember we were all discussing pros and cons to them all, and the end of the conversation was 'go for both of them, Kroos and Pogba, because we're Man United and we need to get back to the top'.",
      "\"And if you get one, it's like yin and yang, we mentioned it a while ago, about if you get centre-backs, with Harry Maguire, and you need a footballing player next to him, it's a bit of the same with midfielders.",
      "\"We're not all the same, and you need a bit to complement each other, and that was how it was left, and then they went all-out for Pogba.\"",
      "United went on to re-sign Pogba in August 2016, in a deal from Juventus that could have reached up to £93m with all of the add-ons included.",
      "The French midfielder went on to make 233 appearances for the club, scoring 39 goals and assisting 51 times for his teammates, before leaving in 2022 on a free transfer.",
      "Pogba's career is often reflected on in different ways, with many remembering the magic he could conjure up, while others believe he never found it consistently enough to match the large fee paid for him.",
      "Perhaps the addition of Toni Kroos, Luka Modric, or Cesc Fabregas alongside him could've changed those fortunes, with the former pair impressing at Real Madrid for many more years to come, while the latter had a spell back in England with Chelsea, before featuring in France and then Italy.",

      "Senne Lammens wore a polo shirt and a navy sweatshirt when he visited Old Trafford after signing for Manchester United. The young goalkeeper looked as though he could be joining United to work in their HR department.",
      "The same observation was made when Lammens reported for international duty with Belgium last week - the 23-year-old was dressed in a beige collared jacket, a khaki t-shirt and chinos.",
      "\"By accident, I saw an article saying he was wearing something boring when he reported for international duty and fans saying they hoped he stays like this,\" laughed Hayk Milkon, one of Lammens' former coaches.",
      "\"This 'boringness' is just the way Senne is, he's really calm and no excesses. He focuses on what he needs to focus on and is open with the people around him. He keeps his feet on the ground.\"",
      "If Lammens looks like someone who could work in an office, every workplace would love to have him in their five-a-side team. United believe they have signed a young goalkeeper with huge potential, and fans who were present at Old Trafford against Sunderland left the stadium buzzing about his debut.",
      "The quirk is that Lammens appears to be a different person when he wears his goalkeeper kit. He made a supremely confident United debut, aggressively commanded his area and kept a clean sheet.",
      "Milkon coached Lammens during their time together at Club Brugge. Milkon is now the youngest manager in the Belgian top-flight and Lammens plays for the biggest club in England.",
      "\"It was Senne with his headphones on. He would go into the gym to do his recovery or some extra top-ups. Or he would just go to relax by playing basketball - he loved to play basketball.\"",
      "Milkon coached in different roles at Club Brugge. He was the assistant of Club NXT (their reserve team), served as their interim manager, was in charge of the Under-18s and eventually became a first-team coach.",
      "His time at Club Brugge coincided with Lammens progressing from the academy to their first team, so he is uniquely positioned to provide insight into United's new goalkeeper signing.",
      "Lammens joined Club Brugge's academy when he was 12. \"He was a guy with huge potential,\" said Milkon. \"As I learned from colleagues who had worked with him when he was much younger, I heard there was a moment that clicked in his head when he became super professional.",
      "\"He was one of the guys during Covid - when the players were not able to train - who was doing a lot at home, he was really going far with this to be the best in these types of areas.",
      "\"Then he continued like this when he joined the first team to train with them. He always wanted to improve. We also had something in place to look at the parameters on which goalkeepers are judged.",
      "\"You see the potential of the goalkeeper based on what they do in games; so their positioning, their decision-making and so on, and Senne was always quite high in these areas.",
      "\"The only bad luck that he had was that the first-team goalkeeper was Simon Mignolet. He's an amazing goalkeeper, so it was difficult for Senne to stay over there in the role of No.2.",
      "\"That would have also blocked his growth, so it was good for him in the end to make the step to go to Antwerp and he did a tremendous job there. It was amazing to see how fast he adapted.\"",
      "Milkon continued: \"I think for us at Club Brugge, it was very clear to everyone that Senne was a top goalkeeper. He would have been the perfect fit for Club Brugge to be the No.1.",
      "\"That was not possible because Mignolet was there. But the parameters that we used to judge his performances indicated he was ticking so many boxes already, and he was consistently doing it.",
      "\"There weren't ups and downs with his performances. He was consistently really high and when you compare this to the top goalkeepers, you have a benchmark to say 'Ok, what potential does this guy have?'",
      "\"He had some chances with the first team at Club Brugge and made a mistake, or maybe two, but in the end it was very clear to everyone that he was a top goalkeeper.",
      "\"It was impossible to try to extend his contract because, again, you have Mignolet, and you cannot block a guy like this. You know he has to go out, he has to play, and he will improve even more.\"",
      "When asked about Lammens' strengths, he said: \"I would say that his decision-making was very good. He is very calm, he sees the solutions on the pitch, he has a quick reaction time and understands the balance between risk and reward, and which decisions are the right ones to make.",
      "\"His clean passing is great, his footwork was really good, and he's just an amazing goalkeeper with the shot-stopping. He made some incredible saves back then already. He's quite a complete goalkeeper.",
      "\"But making the right decisions at a very young age, being very mature with this, was really impressive. And the fact that he is good with both feet is another big strength.",
      "\"For me, Senne is a very calm guy and has all the qualities to be a top professional. That was my impression when I first met him when he was younger and he never changed.\"",
      "Lammens joined Royal Antwerp on a free transfer in the summer of 2023. He was handed his debut a few months later and served as an understudy that season, but earned first-choice status for 2024/2025.",
      "His performances drew attention from the Belgian media. Lammens saved four penalties across a successful first full campaign and received a call-up to Belgium's senior squad in March.",
      "Milkon said: \"I was not surprised when I saw Manchester United had come calling. And to record his first clean sheet, I was really happy for him. Senne is a potential No.1 for the Red Devils - the Belgium national team.",
      "\"He got his chance, he took it, and we're all really proud of him, but we knew it would happen. I believe he has all the capabilities to become the best in the world, so I wish him all the best. I'm sure he will have a very good career in England, and Manchester United should return to the big club they used to be.",
      "\"He will have a positive impact on that, for sure, and hopefully he will be Belgium's first-choice goalkeeper soon. I believe he has the potential, the skillset and the personality to do that.",
      "\"For me, it was just having a tiny little part in having an influence on him at Brugge, but it was the most positive memories of our relationship that we had during this spell.",
      "\"I'm very proud that he is reaching these high levels and not surprised. I believe he will be successful because he is a guy who will not change his focus or start to do something different. He is calm, that's his personality and character, and he wants to succeed. He is hungry and will keep working to be his best.",
      "\"He is so calm, and you have to be patient in football. You cannot worry too much and want things too early, but finding the balance between not being impatient and, at the same time, pushing and demanding what you deserve in a good way, means everything will sort itself out.\"",
      "United staff who have worked with Lammens at Carrington have echoed Milkon's sentiments. He has been described as \"really mature for his age\" and is said to have taken the move in his stride.",
      "Lammens is understood to have impressed coaches during training sessions and a United source said that lots of people have been speaking positively about him. He has already relocated from the luxury hotel where he was initially staying and into a house.",
      "It's no surprise that Lammens likes to play basketball at 6ft 3in, but he is a keen golfer, which is common ground with the likes of Tom Heaton, Luke Shaw, Mason Mount and Harry Maguire.",
      "Matthijs de Ligt, Amad, Maguire and Shaw jogged straight to Lammens to congratulate him after full-time against Sunderland. \"Are you Schmeichel in disguise?\" was chanted at Lammens from the Stretford End.",
      "It remains to be seen whether Lammens will start against Liverpool on Sunday, but it would be a surprise to see him on the bench after delivering a strong debut before the international break.",
      "There would be nothing boring about keeping another clean sheet - this time at Anfield.",
      "Kitbag has slashed the price of Man United kits and merch with up to 50% off select items.",

      "However, the 27-year-old Uruguay international, who has won LaLiga thrice and the Champions League twice with Madrid so far in his career, has failed to make a huge impact in Alonso’s system and has also been forced to play at right-back because of injuries.",
      "IN DEPTH 🔴 Ranking all 25 midfielders Man Utd have been linked with and why Premier League star should be No. 1 target",
      "E-Noticies is a Catalan news outlet, so the report about Valverde and Man Utd has to be taken with a pinch of salt, given the intense rivalry between Barcelona and Real Madrid.",
      "However, in fairness to E-Noticies, it has noted that Madrid have not made ‘a definitive decision’ on the future of Valverde and are ‘remaining cautious’",
      "While ‘there will be no drastic moves in January’, if Valverde gets back to his best by the end of the season, then Madrid will ‘close the door without hesitation’.",
      "This is not the first time in the Spanish media that rumours linking Valverde with Man Utd have emerged.",
      "In September, a report claimed that Man Utd were so keen on Valverde that they were ready to include Kobbie Mainoo in a deal.",
      "At the time, TEAMtalk’s transfer insider, Dean Jones, noted that Valverde will not drop down a level and join Man Utd.",
      "Jones said on September 22: “There feels pretty much no chance Man Utd will sign Valverde – even as the noise grows that they want to.",
      "“That’s the message I’m getting from people close to the Spanish end of this story, and it’s not really surprising.",
      "“He’s been around the club for almost 10 years now and has become a brilliant, crucial and adaptable player for them.",
      "“There is no need for him to drop down a level to join Man Utd, and that’s truly what it would be.",
      "“His profile would be great for Man Utd, but it just seems too ambitious to me.",
      "“The clubs may be on a similar level in terms of global status, but Madrid’s current team is in a much better place than Man Utd’s, and he is a key part of it.”",
      "It is late November now, but it is hard to think that Valverde’s stance on a potential move to Man Utd has changed.",
      "Meanwhile, Man Utd are growing in ‘optimism’ about their chances of signing a Brazilian midfielder, whose club are now ready to sell him.",
      "A Man Utd defender is ready to leave Old Trafford despite having only just arrived at the Premier League club.",
      "And finally, sources have told TEAMtalk’s transfer insider, Dean Jones, about the chances of Man Utd agreeing a new contract with Harry Maguire."

      "Manchester United’s redemption has taken Ruben Amorim out of immediate contention, with Vitor Pereira a clear frontrunner before Wolves decided to get rid.",
      "That put Nuno Espirito Santo and West Ham in clear and present danger of both seeking their third appointment of the season already, but he’s pulled off a couple of wins to ease those fears. Even Nottingham Forest have been a different beast under Sean Dyche, and it all leaves Daniel Farke under the harshest glare of the Sack Race spotlight.",
      "Meanwhile, here are possible replacement managers currently between jobs.",

      "An earlier version of this oft-updated piece speculated on what might happen to Mikel Arteta should Arsenal suffer from their Nightmare Start. What if they lost a few early games? What then? We concluded this:",
      "It’s far likelier that Arsenal emerge blinking into the autumn sunshine broadly unscathed from their nightmare horrors. No denying that this season does represent one in which Arteta might completely lose the plot and go entirely off the rails. Or the one where he wins the league by 10 points. Feels like we’re odds-on to get one or the other.",
      "Arsenal emerged duly unscathed, and have already cashed in on the shift to easier fixtures of their own alongside much tougher ones for Liverpool to take top spot in the Premier League.",
      "Only question that remains, therefore, is what Arsenal do from here. We are absolutely certain that it either involves p*ssing the league by 10 points or a complete and total meltdown. Nothing in between is acceptable or even conceivable. And it really is looking more and more like it’s the first one.",
      "READ: Who will be the next manager of Arsenal if Mikel Arteta is sacked?",
      "",
      "A sacking remains out of the question despite last season’s (relative) struggles. There hasn’t been a Premier League manager since Fergie in his pomp with more credit in the bank than Pep.",
      "But is there still a distinct chance Guardiola decides he’s had enough and simply walks away? We reckon there is, and it’s always worth remembering that we’re talking Next Premier League Manager To Leave here, and that the traditional ‘Sack Race’ shorthand is a bit misleading.",
      "Still, though. Almost no chance at this point that any of that could happen swiftly enough for nobody else to have been canned first. Even if defeat at Newcastle does raise the serious prospect of a second consecutive season without a meaningful title challenge.",
      "",
      "One of the key early-season imponderables for 25/26 was just how big and what kind of impact the Club World Cup might have on the way Chelsea and Man City start the season. Would they hit the ground running, or would they be a bit tired and out of sorts? For both, it’s been a little from column A, a little from column B.",
      "Maresca definitely still has some hearts and minds to win at Chelsea despite the fine finish to the season that saw them tick off Champions League qualification while completing their collection of UEFA pots and pans and then winning the actual Club World Cup.",
      "A home draw with Crystal Palace wasn’t ideal, but the paddling dished out to West Ham has what really should at least be some kind of halfway credible title bid up and running at least. And we strongly suspect Fulham won’t be the last team left scratching their head after losing to Maresca.",

      "That win over Liverpool was big, though, and a particularly good one for Maresca himself. The second half thumping of Forest was handy, too, albeit inevitably saying far more of their opponents than it did of Chelsea. Home defeat to Sunderland saw awkward questions resurfacing, but it’s been three wins from three since then to leave Chelsea quite incongruously second in the league.",

      "Five wins in the bag already, a seven-point lead over Newcastle, and more points than Southampton managed in the entirety of 24/25. Widespread expectation that tougher games would bring Sunderland back down with a bump have thus far proved wide of the mark; there won’t be many teams unhappy at taking four points from two games against Chelsea and Arsenal this season.",

      "Fine end to 24/25 put a different complexion on Brighton’s season than at one time appeared likely. Ending up a clear best of the rest outside the quickly established top seven represented at least a passing grade and they’d have to make a truly awful start to the season to get in any kind of managerial-change bother.",
      "The win over Newcastle to go with victory at Chelsea to go with a win over City reaffirms Brighton’s big-boy-bothering calibre, but does also make some of their other results – draws with Fulham and Wolves, for instance – a bit annoying.",
      "Still, though. Top six after 12 games is fine work whichever way you slice it.",

      "Nailed it in the Community Shield, but as ever for clubs on Palace’s level there’s a positive-and-negative scale to be balanced by your manager catching the eye so conspicuously. Glasner absolutely could be poached with bigger beasts surely paying attention to the work he’s done at Selhurst Park.",
      "And if that poaching comes from outside the Premier League, then it comes with the possibility of making Glasner the next Premier League managerial casualty. But still very unlikely.",

It was a very Brentford move to promote from within and we’ll hold our hands up and admit we thought it would go far, far worse than it has.",

Three wins in four have a distinctly winnable Europa League campaign bubbling along nicely, too. An astonishing shift from what felt like an inexorable downward spiral not that long ago.",

Had Newcastle lost that, as all pre-interlull indications suggested they would, then the spotlight would have been harsh indeed on Howe and his team. They would at that point find themselves slap bang in the muck of a relegation scrap; instead they have lifted themselves back into the mid-table morass where – luckily for them – absolutely nobody is any good at all and the chance of re-establishing themselves in there and even emerging out the top is very real indeed.",
      "There are multiple reasons for Newcastle making such a sticky start to the season and very few of them are directly the fault of a man who did deliver the club’s first trophy in bloody ages last season. That one seismic result against City had vast implications for the title race – in that it confirms there almost certainly won’t now actually be one – but was so big for Newcastle and their manager themselves.",
      "",
      "Burnley really did have a horrible fixture list in these opening weeks under a manager with a horrible record at this level, and were given an opening-day reminder by the team that finished 17th last season of just how much harder the ‘simply don’t concede any goals at all’ tactic might be to deploy in the Premier League.",
      "Essentially, Burnley have got back to this level the same way Homer Simpson got to a heavyweight title fight. And Spurs and City have already given them a pummelling.",
      "Victories over Sunderland and Leeds were an impressive and necessary reminder that it might still be enough against teams more on their level, and while a 3-2 win at Wolves was not exactly The Burnley Way it’s still three points against an established – if struggling – Premier League side.",

He appeared to have already thoroughly De-Anged the lot of them only for them to then turn up against Bournemouth and defend like an Ange team while attacking like a Mourinho one.",
      "You know who else won their first couple of games, including one against Man City, after stepping up to Spurs from a smaller but less daft Premier League club? That’s right. But while the Nuno comparisons are obvious, it doesn’t quite feel like the same situation despite some rumblings of discontent.",
      "Crucially, there was no undignified scramble to find a new manager this time. Whatever your thoughts on the timing and manner of Ange Postecoglou’s sacking and the identity of his replacement, it’s also clear Spurs have got the man they wanted in a way they very obviously didn’t when Nuno came in.",
      "But it’s certainly starting to look uncomfortably similar in familiar ways; the small-time approach to big London derbies against Chelsea and Arsenal has not been well received and the fear grows that he just doesn’t understand what this job requires. The fact almost no manager in Premier League history has managed to understand what this job requires is cold comfort at this time.",

      "Still think both club and manager would live to regret parting ways, but it’s a dicey time.",
      "",
      "Impossible to avoid the conclusion that Slot’s reaction to Liverpool’s mini-crisis becoming actual-crisis was poor. He went Full Klopp with his salty loser behaviour when Manchester United committed the crime of altering their tactics to give themselves the best chance of success against Liverpool, and the headloss continued after another chaotic and unstructured performance led to a 3-2 defeat at Brentford.",
      "Having ticked ‘opposition doing tactics wrong’ off his rattled manager bingo card, he can now add ‘losing his mind over entirely uncontroversial refereeing decisions’ with his response to both the Cody Gakpo non-penalty and Virgil van Dijk penalty at the Gtech.",
      "It has to be a worry for Liverpool that Slot has for the first time in his Anfield career found himself under any kind of pressure after a chastening run of defeats, and has suffered severe and instant headloss as a result.",
      "Funny to think of a manager who’s just beaten Real Madrid in the Champions League being under threat, but defeat at the Etihad was miserable before Nottingham Forest came along and achieved the amusing feat of being the first team to shut Liverpool out in the Premier League at Anfield since Nottingham Forest.",
      "Liverpool are now, hilariously but unacceptably, in the bottom half of the table only a few short months after completing a run of five straight wins to begin the season. They, and Slot, just look unbelievably rattled.",

      "Surely doomed now, and the hard-nosed yet valid argument persists that Leeds could and perhaps should have taken drastic action in the summer. It would have made Spurs’ decision to sack Europa League-winning Ange Postecoglou look positively kind, Leeds – and Burnley for that matter – might now be better off had they thanked the managers who secured 100 Championship points and got them back into the big time and then sent them on their way.",
      "Farke had a dreadful Premier League record of only six wins and 26 points from his 49 games in charge of Norwich, a team he twice led to promotion from the Championship with 94 and 97 points.",
      "As well as fighting his own record in this competition, Farke faces the added burden of expectation levels very different to those at just about any other club that could possibly find itself promoted into the Premier League in this current era where that represents the most bittersweet of successes.",
      "Defeat at Burnley was honking, but bouncing back to win another six-pointer against West Ham eased the stress significantly before a paddling at Brighton and events elsewhere – including West Ham themselves – left Farke desperately short of immediate cover before a desperately poor show in a six-pointer at Nottingham Forest.",
      "Another painful defeat having gone in front, against Villa this time, sees Leeds drop into the bottom three ahead of a brutal run of games, with Man City and Chelsea next before some hope of respite against mid-table Liverpool.",
      "According to reports, Manchester United are about to step up their efforts to keep three players set for the African Cup of Nations for an extra game.",

      "The question Vinicius and his representatives must now be asking is which clubs in world football could offer the £150m likely required to sign him, at least match his £350,000-per-week wages and be comfortable with the reality of him having to be The Man at their club for fear of him throwing a hissy fit if that’s not the case.",

      "Guardiola did say in that same press conference that Doku “will never be a top, top scorer” and City could really do with some goals from their forwards beyond Erling Haaland’s contribution that Vinicius would provide.

      "Vinicius would have just turned eight when Ronaldo, Wayne Rooney and Carlos Tevez were leading the line for United in the 2008 Champions League final win over Chelsea. They weren’t just one of the biggest teams in world football then, they were actually one of the best. Chances are they would have been somewhere near the top of a Vini Jr dream football club list.",
      "Amid reports that a sponsor will ‘cover the cost’ of his transfer for Manchester United the immediate thought is that INEOS are doing things a bit differently to their predecessors. No whopping contracts for quick-fix superstars. Not buying British but buying British based at least; achieving some success in doing so with Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo.",

      "It doesn’t reflect at all well on Vinicius that a team as impeccably well-drilled and brilliant as Arsenal has to be able to cope with having him in the team. While the quality he would provide in attack may not be enough to offset his lack of contribution in defence for others in the Premier League, Mikel Arteta’s side may just be at a stage in his ‘process’ where they can afford a defensive passenger who can make such a difference in the final third.

      "Getting Cristiano Ronaldo off is a genuine disgrace – but Gianni Infantino has plenty of form for being an awful, narcissistic dick.",

      "All teams competing in the Champions League phase are awarded six points just for being there – a huge early boost to England’s tally with two thirds of their nine teams in that competition. You get an additional 0.25 points for finishing 24th in the final table, with an extra 0.25 points on offer for each position from there up. So 23rd gets 0.5, 22nd gets 0.75 and so on all the way up to six points for the table-toppers. The Europa League has no bonus points for competing, but again offers 0.25 points to the team that ends 24th and six to the team finishing first on the same sliding scale as the Champions League.",
      "Just to keep us all on our toes, it’s slightly different again in the Conference. Here you get 0.125 points for 24th, and an extra 0.125 points for each position up to ninth, and then 0.25 points for each extra position you can climb in the top eight.",
      "Long story short, the table-toppers in the Champions League get 12 points altogether, Europa League toppers six points, and Conference League four.",
      "Champions League teams then get an extra 1.5 points for each knockout round they participate in (last 16, quarter-final, semi-final, final), Europa League teams one point for each round, and Conference League teams 0.5 points. There are no bonus points on offer for reaching the playoff round that teams finishing between ninth and 24th in each competition have to deal with, but you do still get result points.",
      "So if you qualify for, say, the Champions League quarter-final by winning both legs of your last-16 clash, you collect 5.5 points for your country’s tally: two for each win and a bonus 1.5 points for reaching the next stage. If you get through with a win and a defeat it’s 3.5 points (two for a win, plus the qualification bonus). And so on.",
      "The total number of points accrued by all teams from a particular league are then divided by the total number of teams from that league who began the season in European competition to obtain an average rating that determines the all-important standings.",
      "This also therefore means individual match wins are worth more to the score for a country that had fewer teams involved to begin with; a win for any Portuguese side this season, for instance, is worth 0.400pts to the final tally because it is two points divided by the five teams they had in contention when the season began, while for England a two-point win is worth only 0.222pts to the total after it has been divided by nine.",
      "",
      "Could pay the price down the line when teams start being eliminated and those that are left see their points still being divided by nine, but for now England are streaking clear. The six bonus points awarded to each of the six Champions League teams are a huge help, but they are also picking up consistently solid results.",
      "All six of England’s representatives there look set for the knockout stages, with none currently lower than 16th despite a ropey set of results on matchday five, while Villa and Palace also look near certainties to progress from the Europa and Conference respectively. For all their nonsense, Forest ought to be fine in the end too.",

      "Hugo Ekitike? Not a back-up. Another Liverpool forward soon to be mentioned? Very much a back-up.",

      "According to reports, Manchester United are about to step up their efforts to keep three players set for the African Cup of Nations for an extra game.",
      "Man Utd crashed down to earth on Monday night as Everton ended their unbeaten run in the Premier League.",
      "They had been praised for their improved form under head coach Ruben Amorim as his tactical tweaks and the positive impact made by summer signings contributed to their five-game unbeaten run in the Premier League.",
      "This is why the 1-0 loss to 10-man Everton was so disappointing, with this result putting Amorim and his players back under intense scrutiny.",
      "Man Utd will look to return to winning ways this weekend as they travel to face Crystal Palace at Selhurst Park, but they will soon be dealt a further blow as Bryan Mbeumo, Amad Diallo and Noussair Mazraoui are set to feature at next month’s African Cup of Nations.",
      "READ: Revealed: The date Ruben Amorim will be sacked and why with this ‘as bad as it gets’ for Manchester United",
      "The AFCON is running between December 21 and January 18, with Man Utd facing being without Mbeumo, Amad and/or Mazraoui for a maximum of eight Premier League matches.",
      "At the moment, Man Utd’s game against Wolves at Molineux on December 8 is due to be their final match before the major tournament, but a report from The Daily Mail are reportedly trying to keep them for the match against Bournemouth on December 15.",
      "United are said to be ‘scrambling to keep this star trio for an extra game’ and they ‘will accelerate discussions’ over their ‘release dates’ in the coming days.",
      "It is also noted that they ‘will seek assistance from the three national federations after Everton exposed the lack of depth in Amorim’s squad’, while they could repeat a ‘struck deal’ with Andre Onana before the 2023 AFCON.",
      "The report claims:",
      "‘Confidential revealed that United struck a deal with Cameroon so Andre Onana ended up missing only one game during the last AFCON two years ago, and Amorim confirmed last week that the club are exploring ways to hold onto Mbeumo, Diallo and Mazraoui for as long as possible.’",
      "Amorim, meanwhile, has issued a warning to summer signing Benjamin Sesko and explained why he is not guaranteed to start for Man Utd when he’s fit.",
      "“We did that against Liverpool. It wasn’t with Bryan Mbeumo, it was with Cunha, and it is an option we have,” Amorim claimed.",
      "“Nowadays, not only in the English league but also in the Portuguese league and across all leagues, there is a big variation in how teams build their play. We do not control it fully. We can call it a 4-4-2, but after five minutes it becomes a 4-3-3 or a 3-4-3.",
      "“I am willing to do anything. Contrary to what many people think, I am not fixed on just one idea. I simply start from a base, but it is obvious that we can adapt in future.",
      "“We have already considered that with Bryan, because he is very strong in transitions. I do not think it is his best position, because he prefers to stay hidden and not be so visible. He can attack and be more dangerous on either side, whether on the right or the left, than as a central forward.",
      "“But it is a good option and something I could use in future, as I have already done several times in the past.”",
      "Daniel Farke is clear Sack Race favourite as Leeds slump into the bottom three, but Arne Slot is now second as the Liverpool collapse continues.",
      "Ruben Amorim earned himself a little time with an unbeaten Manchester United run, but that defeat to Everton was rotten.",

      "Manchester United may need to remodel their left side, especially if Ruben Amorim is sticking around, while two midfielders must be replaced…",
      "Much of Amorim’s first summer in charge at Old Trafford was spent trying to shift players he did not want or saw no future for. It will be a similar story next year if United are serious about a rebuild.",
      "As Amorim marks a year since his first game, here are five players who ought not to be around in 12 months…",
      "",
      "It has been a rough week for Shaw, who bore the brunt of Gary Neville’s frustration on Monday night.",
      "Neville, irked by United’s lack of intensity while chasing the game against Everton, might have been venting but he wasn’t wrong. Shaw was ‘ambling’.",
      "It is an apt description of the former England defender who seem to have become more and more one-paced since entering his 30s. His defending can be passive and though he doesn’t get the same opportunities to bomb on as part of a back three as he might as a wing-back or full-back, you would have to question if Shaw is still capable of that.",
      "At least he is available. He has started all 12 games, compared to just 16 starts over the previous two seasons. Only once in the last four seasons has he started more than half of United’s Premier League games.",
      "Next summer, Shaw will have turned 31 and be entering the final year of a contract that makes him joint fifth among United’s highest earners. Those numbers don’t add up when it comes to INEOSonomics. They already decided the last one was a mistake in 2023.",
      "",
      "We have all held our hands up and admitted we were wrong to write off Casemiro. Some did so more forcefully, disrespectfully than others. This season, the Brazilian has once more become one of United’s most important players.",
      "It is safe to assume, though, that there is little longevity in that status. He will be 34 in February and in the last four months of his massive contract at Old Trafford.",
      "If INEOS were p*ssed about Shaw’s contract, Casemiro’s terms left Sir Jim Ratcliffe apoplectic. The Brazilian is the highest earner at the club, on a salary it is hard to envisage United ever offering again on Ratcliffe’s watch.",
      "More to the point, United desperately need a top-class central midfielder, maybe two. If Casemiro is still the first-choice no.6 next season, we know something has gone terribly wrong with their recruitment.",
      "",
      "Speaking of terrible recruitment…",
      "Ugarte, unfortunately, is damned by Scott McTominay’s stunning success at Napoli. United sold the Ballon d’Or nominee and put that money towards the £50million sent PSG’s way – presumably, much to their astonishment – in an effort to replace Casemiro.",
      "It is perhaps an unfair comparison, but hard to ignore given the trajectories of the two midfielders. McTominay has made himself one of Europe’s most wanted; Ugarte can’t get a game for a team in dire need of his supposed profile.",
      "It takes time to adapt to the Premier League, but it’s been almost a season and a half now. This was the season he needed to step up. And Ugarte looks further away than he ever did.",
      "Having worked with Amorim at Sporting Lisbon, it was thought that Ugarte would be one of the main beneficiaries of the manager’s appointment. But Amorim has been left stunned at the difference in player he bossed at Sporting Lisbon compared to the one who sits on his bench. “He is struggling in the moment,” said Amorim. “He needs to improve, especially in training.” That last part is damning indeed.",
      "Alarm bells were ringing immediately after United signed Zirkzee when no one could really identify what he was. When the question was put to the man himself he admitted that he was neither a no.9 nor a no.10. “I am what I call a false striker. Not a No 9, not a No 10. I am a 9.5.”",
      "It is bad enough when United sign players for positions that are not a priority, but signing a player in a position that does not actually exist was a new low.",
      "So it can come as no surprise that Zirkzee has struggled to adapt. A year after his arrival, United felt it necessary to buy a whole new strikeforce, which left the Netherlands forward in no doubt over his prospects.",
      "Injuries to Benjamin Sesko and Matheus Cunha gave Zirkzee an opportunity to lead Amorim’s line against Everton. “He did alright,” said Amorim, damning the 24-year-old with the faintest of praise. It is not an opportunity he is likely to get again any time soon, assuming Cunha is back for the trip to Palace on Sunday.",
      "",
      "All we’re prepared to commit to here is that if United are to persist with wing-backs, they need a new one for the left flank.",
      "Neville effectively wrote off the entire left side as an attacking threat against Everton, and he wasn’t wrong. Which makes the looming AFCON all the more worrying for United since they will lose Amad Diallo and Bryan Mbeumo, the two players that make their right side so much more potent.",
      "On the opposite side, Amorim seems to favour Dorgu but it’s a close-run thing since neither the Dane nor Dalot have been able to pin down the role as their own.",
      "That’s maybe more understandable in Dalot’s case since he is right-sided. Even if he starts high and wide – not his natural habitat – he is only ever going to drive inside into traffic. Dalot’s versatility has come in useful for numerous managers now since Jose Mourinho signed him while telling the world the Portuguese could be United’s right-back for 10 years. Almost eight years later, he’s not that.",
      "Dorgu, 21, is still a relative rookie having joined United from Parma less than a year ago. But in that time, in 32 appearances, he has as many red cards as assists (one) and no goals.",
      "Beyond the numbers, it is hard to recall any contribution of note. Just a run, a cross, a shot. Anyone?",
      "Dorgu seemed a strange signing given he was a relative rookie and the importance of wing-backs in Amorim’s system. Already, they need another.",
      "Martin Zubimendi is one of four defensive midfielders in our top 10 Premier League signings of 25/26, highlighting the importance of having an elite No.6.",
      "With racism in football refusing to f*** all the way off, we want to hear your views and your experiences on one of the thorniest issues in the game…",
      "Getting Cristiano Ronaldo off is a genuine disgrace – but Gianni Infantino has plenty of form for being an awful, narcissistic dick.",
      "Is it as simple as Liverpool being so rotten because they are grieving Diogo Jota? There is an argument that no coach could combat that.",
      "It seems Jurgen Klopp has already given Liverpool two names to replace Arne Slot and one of them is Steven Gerrard.",
      "Are Liverpool about to sack Arne Slot? They actually really might be after that absolute sh*t-show against PSV."

      "When David Moyes said Manchester United “must improve in a number of areas”, he listed three facets of their game. Or, well, the entire sport: “Passing, creating chances and defending.”",
      "He did not cite whipping balls into the box. Little wonder, as exactly two months later his team was breaking the record for the most crosses attempted by a team in a single Premier League game.",
      "Rene Meulensteen called the Manchester United approach “quite straightforward” and “easy to defend against”. Dan Burn had “never headed that many balls since the Conference” and was “happy for them to play like that”. Darren Bent “knew that was going to happen” and was also “happy for them to play like that,” having had as many touches in his own box as the opposition’s despite scoring a last-minute equaliser.",
      "And Moyes admitted it was “as bad as it gets”, with his P45 ultimately swung in 72 days after those 81 crosses epitomised his reign.",
      "This was worse. This was weeks of steadily building progress completely squandered, and Ruben Amorim’s most damaging proclivities coming to the fore again.",
      "It was Moyes securing his first ever Premier League win as a visiting manager at Old Trafford in 18 attempts dating back to 2002, Manchester United suffering their first ever Premier League home defeat after seeing the opposition have a player sent off, and Everton not failing to have a single shot after their goal, but instead rather sagely identifying the distinct lack of any need to try.",
      "They had Idrissa Gueye dismissed for a baffling moment of self-destruction in the 13th minute but produced a performance of determined grit and organised obduracy which had both managers praising the infighting post-match.",
      "MORE ON THE MANCHESTER UNITED MESS FROM F365\n👉 Neville slammed for ‘thinking he’s second coming of Guardiola’ with verdict of ‘ambling’ star\n👉 Amorim ‘furious’ with two stars for ‘completely disregarding instructions’ vs Everton\n👉 Ruben Amorim ‘asking for’ sack with Manchester United tactics v 10-man Everton",
      "“I quite like when my players have a fight,” said Moyes, resisting the obvious temptation to say only that the situation would be handled internally. “I don’t want them to accept someone not doing well enough.”",
      "“I hope my players, when they lose the ball, they fight each other,” Amorim added.",
      "But when the Portuguese also describes it as “my fault” that said players “didn’t understand the moments of the game during the 90 minutes,” and that he needs to better “explain to the players how to play in every situation of the game,” it is difficult to see how Casemiro scrapping with Matthijs de Ligt over a misplaced pass would help.",
      "At least Jose Mourinho controlled the “brain” if not the body of only Luke Shaw, the manager “making every decision” for a player who “cannot play with my understanding of the game”.",
      "Amorim has taken on that responsibility for an entire team which apparently cannot think for itself even when confronted by an opponent with one win in four games, reduced to ten men for 77 minutes and without a win of any kind at that stadium since December 2013, during the mess of the Moyes season when it felt like a team would record their first win at Old Trafford in decades every other week.",
      "If this group needs a coach to issue reminders about the need to raise their intensity and diversify their course of attack somewhat against a team down one player then it is yet again difficult to envisage quite how this arrangement ultimately works.",
      "Manchester United put in 38 crosses against Everton, bringing into question Amorim’s claim about having spent the international break watching what opposition managers do before coming to the conclusion that James Tarkowski and Michael Keane might struggle under an aerial assault.",
      "That is not even close to touching those absurd numbers posted against Fulham but still nine more than their previous season high across 120 minutes on that miserable evening at Grimsby, and their most in a Premier League game since October 2018.",
      "That was when Mourinho was to be sacked regardless of the result delivered against Newcastle, only for Alexis Sanchez to grant him a stay of execution with a last-minute winner in a wretched game.",
      "Mourinho was finally shown the door 73 days later, lasting about 24 hours longer than Moyes after he bore those 81 crosses.",
      "Perhaps that represents a harbinger of doom for Amorim, whose rollercoaster would finally end on February 5 going by that timeline. Manchester United’s last match before that execution date being at home to Fulham is almost too narratively satisfying.",
      "This was every bit as desperate as those displays under patently doomed managers, every inch as uninspiring a gameplan and reaction. That it was so thoroughly exposed by Moyes, long but no longer the poster boy for Manchester United’s era of sustained failure post-Ferguson, was most damning of all.",
      "The list of things Manchester United must improve remains painfully long more than a decade later; despite that slight recent upturn, the manager is still towards the top of it after all these years.",

      "Post-shot expected goals is expected goals based on how likely the goalkeeper is to save the shot. When the number of goals they have conceded is subtracted, we are left with the figures below.",
      "FBREF explains that positive numbers suggest better luck or an above-average ability to stop shots.",
      "Including only those who have played three or more games, here’s how the Premier League shot-stoppers are performing this season.",
      "And here’s who was the best goalkeeper in 2024/25.",
      "",
      "Henderson had serene outings against Brentford, Brighton and Wolves, keeping consecutive clean sheets as Palace firm up again. The England keeper will doubtless fancy himself as Thomas Tuchel’s No.1 in USA next summer. Any chance?",
      "",
      "… Not with Pickford in his form. Consecutive clean sheets and a string of saves at Manchester United, who failed to score from a PSxG of 1.8, see the Everton stopper climb here. Pickford just needs to avoid a crash in form to cruise into the World Cup as Tuchel’s No.1.",
      "",
      "Spurs being wretched against Chelsea wasn’t bad news for everyone at Spurs – Vicario padded his stats by conceding just one from a PSxG of 3.2. But six goals conceded in the draw with Manchester United and the miserable north London derby defeat came from a combined PSxG of 4.6.",
      "",
      "Replacing clean sheet machine Trafford at Burnley, Dubravka has made a very solid start at Turf Moor. Which is handy since he has faced more shots than any other goalkeeper. Might already have save of the season tied up after preserving Burnley’s win at Wolves in the dying seconds but should have done more to prevent West Ham’s second and third goals.",
      "What a save from Dubravka 🧤 pic.twitter.com/YmY4Lq2abB",
      "",
      "Verbruggen’s rotten record last season didn’t stop him once again being linked with the likes of Bayern Munich in the summer. In recent weeks, the Dutchman looked more like a goalkeeper who might catch the eye of the big boys after a shakier start to the season and the late, win-preserving penalty save against Brentford sees him climb here.",
      "",
      "Fat lot of good topping this list after the first three games did Trafford. This is likely to be his number for the rest of the season unless Gianluigi Donnarumma suffers a misfortune.",
      "",
      "Sunderland fans have been raving about Roefs after his start to life on Wearside and everyone else is starting to see what the fuss is about. Only Dubravka has made more saves and no-one has a higher saves percentage (79.2%).",
      "",
      "The massive Italian has emerged as City’s undisputed No.1 to the shock of no one and the horror of James Trafford. Donnarumma has made a solid start to life in the Premier League but showed for the first time against Bournemouth some vulnerability to crosses.",

      "His England recall was scuppered by a concussion suffered at Brentford and a run of five clean sheets in the first seven games has been followed by none in five.",
      "",
      "Lammens dazzled United fans with some simple competency but the first questions were asked of the Belgian after Everton’s win at Old Trafford from 0.4 PSxG. Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall’s shot was within reach, but Lammens was caught off balance and forced to push off the wrong foot, reducing the distance he could dive.",
      "",
      "A big climber after matchday 12 at Bournemouth, moving from 23rd to here and into the black after conceding twice from a PSxG of 4.1. Still has some way to go to convince Hammers fans he should be their long-term No.1.",
      "",
      "Life is rarely quiet when Martinez has the mitts on. He began the season well, then tailed off quite alarmingly, but a clean sheet and a penalty save against Bournemouth was more like it. Then he went to Leeds and conceded a shocker.",
      "",
      "Last season’s joint winner of the Golden Glove award had a wretched few weeks, falling 13 places in this list before facing Leeds then Liverpool. In no game have Forest faced fewer shots on target than Arne Slot’s side managed at Anfield.",
      "",
      "Johnstone has been more reliable than Jose Sa but Sunderland’s opener cut the ex-England keeper in half; Burnley’s first took him by surprise; and he might feel he could have kept out the first of Fulham’s three. Harsh? Probably. At Chelsea, he was powerless to stop any of the Blues’ three second-half goals and it was a similar story in the defeat to Palace.",
      "",
      "It almost doesn’t matter what Sanchez does, everyone has already decided that Chelsea need an upgrade. And they are probably correct.",

      "Alisson’s return came as a relief after five games out but even he was powerless to stop Liverpool caving against Forest, who scored three from a PSxG of 2.5.",
      "",
      "Leno was bouncing back from a poor season by his own high standards with an impressive start to this campaign but defeats at Villa and Bournemouth were expensive for the German when it comes to this particular metric. Clean sheets against Wolves and Sunderland have provided a small boost.",
      "",
      "Raya faced more shots on his target at Sunderland than the previous four games combined. He kept out neither of them. Then he conceded to Spurs from their only shot on target which had a PSxG of 0.1.",

      "Literally no one views Bayindir as a credible No.1, including Ruben Amorim. Since he was dropped for Lammens, United haven’t lost. Coincidence?",

There have been goals for which the big Georgian was beaten rather easily so a clean sheet against Villa was much-needed for his confidence. Only to be stitched up by Virgil van Dijk at City, where saving an Erling Haaland penalty couldn’t spare him from falling here.",

      "Alternatively, Man Utd could sanction a cheaper move for Wolves star Joao Gomes. Earlier this week, a report claimed a deal worth £44m is already ‘close’ to happening as he is keen to join the Red Devils.",
      "However, Ornstein has poured cold water on these reports as “there’s been no talk at this point”, but he has explained why he thinks Wolves could “cash in”.",
      "“There has been reports about Joao Gomes. Sources around Molineux are sort of playing it down,” Ornstein said on NBC Sports.",
      "“There’s been no club–club talks at this point, but of course if Wolves are staring at relegation come January, they might look to cash in on him then…",
      "“Other options Manchester United clearly like are Elliot Anderson, Adam Wharton, and Baleba too.”",
      "Man Utd could also sign a new striker to provide competition for Sesko and ex-Arsenal defender Bacary Sagna has explained why they should prioritise Crystal Palace star Jean-Philippe Mateta.",
      "“It would make sense if Jean-Philippe Mateta went to Manchester United,” Sagna said.",

      "“It could be difficult for him as a new player coming into a club where there are a lot of new players and transferring his skills across from Crystal Palace, but a move to Old Trafford would be good for him and the club.",
      "“It will also be difficult for Palace to keep hold of him, and it’s the right moment for him to move if he wants the test of playing for one of the biggest teams in the Premier League.",
      "“He’s not a young player anymore and it might be one of the last moves of his career, so he will probably push for it if the opportunity arises.”",

      "Luke Shaw came under fire as Man Utd's defeat to Everton raised more questions of Ruben Amorim's system; Gary Neville on Luke Shaw against Everton: \"He's ambling. You can't do that. He should be running forward every single time\"",
      "By Nick Wright, Oliver Yew and Adam Smith",
      "Tuesday 25 November 2025 15:06, UK",
      "Gary Neville slammed Luke Shaw's lack of intensity as Manchester United slumped to another low under head coach Ruben Amorim with their 1-0 defeat to 10-man Everton.",
      "The 30-year-old, playing as the left-sided centre-back in Ruben Amorim's back three, was singled out for \"ambling\" forward as Manchester United tried, and failed, to recover from a goal down.",
      "Shaw is one of four Manchester United players, along with Matthijs De Ligt, Bruno Fernandes and Bryan Mbeumo, to have started every Premier League game this season. It has been a rare period of availability for a player dogged by fitness issues.",
      "Last season, he only completed 90 minutes once in the Premier League, having only done so seven times in the campaign before that. You have to go back to 2022/23 for the last time he managed to feature consistently across a full season.",
      "Staying fit has proved a major challenge for Shaw.",
      "Once a marauding full-back with the energy to shuttle between the two boxes, his physicality is not what it used to be. His lack of intensity against Everton riled Neville with Manchester United trailing against 10 men and needing a goal.",
      "\"You have Shaw, [Leny] Yoro and [Matthijs] De Ligt behind the ball,\" he said on co-commentary. \"Shaw is getting forward more, but he's ambling forward, let's be clear. He's been bugging me for the last 20 minutes. He's ambling. You can't do that.",
      "\"He should be running forward every single time. I don't care. Yoro, I have a little bit more sympathy for but Shaw? That's a waste of time. I don't care. It's not conning anybody. I'm not having it.\"",
      "Shaw's physical decline can be seen in the numbers. There is a caveat in that he has been used in a role which requires less running under Amorim, as a centre-back rather than a full-back, but the drop-off in many areas predates the head coach's arrival.",
      "Shaw's sprints and kilometres covered per 90 minutes have followed a downward trend and his attacking output has also declined.",
      "Shaw has steadily contributed fewer crosses, goal involvements and chances created over the course of the last five seasons.",
      "Gary Neville says Manchester United's performance in the 1-0 defeat to 10-man Everton \"smelt of complacency\" and will \"erode trust\" in Ruben Amorim's team.",
      "Despite Shaw's limitations, Amorim's system once again came under intense scrutiny.",
      "Still trailing, Amorim made changes to try and get back into the game, bringing on Diogo Dalot for Patrick Dorgu and Kobbie Mainoo for Casemiro. They were like-for-like substitution as the United boss left Shaw, De Ligt and Yoro on the pitch, sticking with his three-at-the back system for the full 90 minutes.",
      "It was a move that left many Man Utd fans frustrated, particularly bringing on the right-footed Dalot to play in front of Shaw as the pair ended up getting in each other's way on Manchester United's left side.",
      "\"You have to have urgency and make the pitch as big as possible, and you have to put as many players as possible in forward areas,\" said Neville.",
      "\"Ruben Amorim has a question to answer,\" he added.",
      "\"Bringing Dalot on over there in front of Shaw? I don't quite see it. You have five at the back, why? Embarrassing.",
      "\"This should be like the Alamo. Really quick, high-tempo passing side-to-side, getting into good wide areas, putting crosses in, getting bodies in attack, sustaining attacks. It's very slow from United. There is no presence in the box whatsoever.\"",
      "Once again, Amorim being wedded to his 3-4-3 formation and his reluctance to change in-game proved costly for United. His devotion to playing three at the back has come to be seen as a flaw, especially when trying to chase games.",
      "Questions will be asked again of Amorim and his flexibility. It's hard to see why he kept his three central defenders on the pitch and didn't throw extra attackers on against Everton when it was obvious they were lacking a focal point in the absence of the injured Benjamin Sesko and Matheus Cunha, something which was also highlighted by Jamie Carragher after the game on Monday Night Football.",
      "\"Ruben Amorim feels like the first manager I've seen who sticks with a system rather than an idea of how to play,\" Carragher said. \"It feels like the formation is his baby and to not change it or alter it in certain situations like that [against Everton], I don't understand how you can stick with it so steadfastly.",
      "\"If you have to stick with the system, put a midfielder in defence, which we have seen managers do in the past, because you are going to have so much of the ball.",
      "\"It's not about losing the three points against Everton, I think it is one of those moments where people will really question the manager. He will take a lot of the blame.\"",
      "Amorim still has Lisandro Martinez to return from injury. The Argentina international will likely slot back into the left-sided centre-back role, but Shaw looks unsuited to playing at wing-back and Amorim's other options are also underperforming.",
      "At Sporting, his wing-backs were attacking outlets vital in making his system work. In his final full season in charge, in 2023/24, Nuno Santos, Geny Catamo and Ricardo Esagio, his three most-used wing-backs, contributed a combined total of 26 goals or assists between them in league games alone.",
      "Amorim's wing-backs at Manchester United have contributed half as many goals or assists across a similar number of league games.",
      "And nine of their 13 goals and assists, roughly 70 per cent, have come from Amad Diallo, with the others used in the position, Dorgu, Dalot, Noussair Mazraoui, Harry Amass and Tyrell Malacia, only managing four between them in a combined 67 starts at wing-back.",
      "The struggles of Amorim's wing-backs raise further questions about Amorim's devotion to his system. If they are not contributing offensively, then what are they really bringing to the table?",
      "It is just one of many questions for their under-fire head coach, who can add Shaw's decline to a growing list of problems.",

      "\"I see the ideal Manchester United midfielder as being able to do everything.\"",
      "The words of former Old Trafford metronome, Paul Scholes.",
      "United's midfield remains a problem. Ruben Amorim's system continues to be drawn into question, a set-up with its frailties further scrutinised as a result of an insistence on leaving two players anchoring in the middle of the park.",
      "Whether it be personnel or instruction, United's inability to consistently control games continues to cost them.",
      "In a test of Amorim's system against 10-man Everton on Monday night, United had very few answers. Instead, Amorim's rare unbeaten run of five matches fell to a dismal end as United were outplayed, outfought and outthought.",
      "With 718 appearances for United, 155 goals and a trophy haul to rival most English football clubs, very few have taken to the Old Trafford midfield like Scholes once did.",
      "As he sat in central London, given an opportunity to mull over the past ahead of a live event for his podcast, The Good the Bad, The Ugly, being asked \"What makes a Manchester United midfielder?\", the proverbial gears began to turn.",
      "\"It's a little bit different when I played because you hear these number 6s, number 8s, number 10s, I suppose, come into that midfield role as well,\" Scholes says.",
      "\"You can attack, you can defend, you can be part of everything. That's your job as a midfield player for Manchester United.\"",
      "Scholes did it all in the middle of the park. He partnered the greats in a traditional 4-4-2, spent a spell as a shadow striker and in the latter days, relied on a superior reading of the game to drop into a deeper role.",
      "While his career spanned over nearly two decades, it was an era that rarely referred to the number like today, instead, characteristics and traits defined your position.",
      "\"I go back to Brian Robson, Roy Keane, Nicky Butts, [they] are capable of doing everything,\" Scholes says, reeling off names cast into United's successes of the past.",
      "\"You have to be capable of doing that. The game's changed. There's a holding midfield player, there's maybe two attacking midfield players.\"",
      "Perhaps United's issue is that the club lack the all-rounders Scholes is eulogising about. Have the discernible roles harmed United's midfield? Or will United be able to find a happy medium?",
      "\"I think it [the Man Utd midfield] has got better. Casemiro's been really good this season.",
      "\"Are you going to win the league with Casemiro and Bruno Fernandes in a central midfield partnership? I'm not too sure, it still seems a little bit away from that. But on the whole, the midfield has looked a little bit better.\"",
      "But while marginal improvements are evident, United's midfield seemingly feels aeons away from what it needs to be to close the proverbial gap on the league challengers. Is the answer closer to home?",
      "Kobbie Mainoo emerged as a key player for Erik ten Hag when he made his debut in 2023. That 'Everton debut' that fans reminisce about didn't see him deployed as a No 10, nor as a No 8. Instead, an 18-year-old Mainoo was United's deepest midfielder when he impressed.",
      "An England debut followed in the summer, where at the 2024 European Championship, England's performances improved when Mainoo started alongside Rice as a No 8 as the competition drew on.",
      "Mainoo started the Euro final for England but just two camps later, found himself hurled into the shadows as Rice's partner gained new suitors. Now 20, Mainoo is now on the periphery of United's first team plans, yet to start a Premier League game this season. It's the apparent stunting of a talent that hits Scholes personally.",
      "\"Kobbie Mainoo came on the other night [against Everton], he needs games of football, it looks like he was a little bit off the pace of the night because he's not played. You could expect that.",
      "\"One of the most disappointing things for me is Kobbie Mainoo not being involved in this Manchester United team,\" Scholes admits.",
      "\"We saw how good he was 18 months, two years ago, and for some reason it's not quite happened for him. The manager doesn't seem to quite fancy him, but we all know the qualities he has.",
      "\"But the manager's just for some reason preferring somebody else, and that's something he has to deal with.",
      "\"I think he's dealt with it quite well at this minute, but at some point, he will get frustrated.",
      "\"As I'm frustrated with watching Manchester United at times as well, and especially with Kobbie Mainoo, because home-grown talent, we don't have many of them anymore, and we want him in our team.",
      "\"He [Amorim] possibly doesn't trust him physically at the minute. Casemiro isn't the most physical, but he's streetwise. He knows the position, he's done it for so many years in a great Real Madrid team, so he's got that experience.",
      "\"Kobbie hasn't quite got that experience yet. I think Kobbie, if he's going to play, he needs to play in a midfield three, really. Manchester United don't do that.\"",
      "\"They've got a midfield two with two 10s. So, for him to get one of those positions is something he's got to work his way into doing now. Maybe you need two Bruno Fernandes.",
      "\"You need a Bruno Fernandes to be the playmaker, and one to be a No 10 as well. I think Kobbie Mainoo is more than capable of being that playmaker, next to a Casemiro or a [Manuel] Ugarte.",
      "\"I think he's clever enough in possession, but for some reason the manager doesn't seem to think he's the answer at the minute.\"",
      "Unfortunately, United don't have two Fernandeses. Much to the delight of Premier League officials. So United's problems remain. How have United both unsuccessfully and to some avail solved their conundrums in the past? A flashy new toy, a transfer for fans to enjoy for as long as they feel they are performing.",
      "So if given the choice, who would one of United's most esteemed performers choose as the club's midfield saviour?",
      "\"I think all three of them are really good players. Baleba is very young, but they're all quite young, aren't they?",
      "\"But Baleba is very young. Quality-wise, is he quite there? I think he's almost in a Caicedo type of way.",
      "\"He's done really well at Chelsea, don't get me wrong, but is that the type of player Manchester United need? I'm not sure.",
      "\"Adam Wharton is, again, a really good player. Can he get around the pitch? Old Trafford's a big pitch. It's a really big pitch to get around, and you need to have some physicality. You need to have legs in that position.",
      "\"I'd say, going off the England form, this has surprised me more than anything is Elliot Anderson. I really liked him when he was at Newcastle, but I thought he was more of an attacking player, maybe play the 8 or 10. I don't like saying numbers, but he looks more of an 8 or 10.",
      "\"He's come into that role for England and looks very accomplished, very stylish. Keeps the ball really well, will pass it forward as well. I'd like to see all three of them.",
      "\"I'd probably say I'd go Wharton. I still don't think they're any of the Manchester United style midfield players, they're more the style of football these days.",
      "\"I just think Wharton's got a little bit more quality. That's tough saying that. I think he's got more quality than Baleba.",
      "\"Baleba's got more legs, so that evens itself out a little bit. It's close between Elliot Anderson and Wharton. I'd just pick Wharton.\"",
      "Hypotheticals were something Scholes rarely dealt in as a player. A fully functioning midfield was part of the furniture for many years at Old Trafford. Unfortunately for him, his ideal United midfield man remains just an if, but and a maybe.",
      "One thing is for certain, though, United will continue the season, waiting for the midfielder that \"can do everything\".",

      "\"Everton dominated them with 11 men and with 10 men, in a different way of domination, but they dominated them through their fight and their spirit.",
      "\"It's complacency, and complacency will kill you. The minute that you think as a football player that you just have to turn up on that pitch and you're Manchester United and you can play or any football club, you're done.",
      "\"It just smelt of complacency [from United]. They weren't at it from the beginning. That is a bad one for United.",
      "\"You can't go from the fight that they showed in certain games to that. It just erodes confidence, it erodes trust. We're trying to build a trust in a manager, we're trying to build a trust in a team.",
      "\"The fans booed collectively at the end. It was loud, and rightly so. That was a really poor performance. It's almost as if you've gone sort of like two or three steps forward, everyone's feeling a little bit better about themselves, and you've just gone back to the start again.",
      "\"You can lose football matches, but you can't lose them like that. That's nowhere near good enough, it's not acceptable.\"",
      "Carragher added: \"This is a bad night for the manager. There was an awful long time left in that game [after 10-man Everton went ahead].",
      "\"I don't understand how you can stick with something so steadfastly in a situation like that when it's basically one guy up front who's not really up front, you don't need three players [at the back] there.",
      "\"It's one of those moments where I think a lot of people will really question the manager on the back of that defeat. They'll look at the players, and we know the players should do better, but the manager will take a lot of the blame for tonight.\"",

      "Tuesday 25 November 2025 00:05, UK",
      "Ruben Amorim's Manchester United era hit a new low as they lost 1-0 to an Everton side playing over 75 minutes with 10 men after Idrissa Gueye's red card for striking team-mate Michael Keane.",
      "In extraordinary scenes at Old Trafford, Gueye got into an argument with centre-back Keane early in the first half and replays showed the midfielder raise his hands to the Everton defender's face. Gueye apologised to his team-mates at full-time.",
      "That moment should have allowed United to completely control of the game - if anything it did the opposite. Amorim's side looked like the team with 10 men - and Everton deservedly took the lead through Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall's stunner from distance.",
      "The midfielder's solo run got him to the edge of the box before he fired past Senne Lammens' outstretched gloves and into the net - with more questions falling to a United goalkeeper this season.",
      "United failed to take full advantage of their extra man in the first half, with their players booed off after their best chance was a Bruno Fernandes 30-yard strike which Jordan Pickford simply saved.",
      "United - missing Benjamin Sesko and Matheus Cunha through injury - started the second half in a similar vein. Half-time substitute Mason Mount put two chances wide, while Bryan Mbeumo saw an effort saved by Pickford.",
      "\"You have five at the back, why?\" said Neville. \"They still don't win the first ball or second ball. Embarrassing.",
      "\"The subs have taken him down a cul-de-sac. There's no agility or flexibility firstly from the coach, but also the players.\"",
      "Man Utd: Lammens (4); Yoro (5), De Ligt (5), Shaw (3); Mazraoui (4), Casemiro (3), Fernandes (4), Dorgu (4); Amad (4), Zirkzee (3), Mbeumo (5)\n\n\nSubs:  Mount (4), Dalot (4), Mainoo (4)\n\n\nEverton: Pickford (9); Coleman (n/a), Tarkowski (8), Keane (8), Mykolenko (7); Gueye (1), Garner (7), Dewsbury-Hall (9); Ndiaye (8), Barry (8), Grealish (8) \n\n\nSubs:  O’Brien (7), Beto (n/a), Iroegbunam (n/a), McNel (n/a), Alcaraz (n/a)\n\n\nPlayer of the Match:  Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall",
      "United almost found a way through when Joshua Zirkzee, starting his first United game for 225 days, forced Pickford into two wonder saves, before he then headed a Kobbie Mainoo cross wide.",
      "More boos rang out at full-time as former United coach David Moyes got his first win at Old Trafford as a visiting manager. For Amorim, this is a massive low.",
      "\"Frustration, disappointment with the way we played the game. They were the better team with 11 men. They defended really well with 10 men for 70 minutes. We deserved to lose. We didn't play well, with the right intensity.",
      "\"We are not there, not even near the point that we should be to fight for the best positions. We have a lot to do. We have to be perfect to win games, we were not perfect to win games.",
      "On the Everton red card: \"Fighting is not a bad thing. Fighting doesn't mean they don't like each other. Fighting is if you lose the ball, I will fight you because we will suffer a goal. That was my feeling with that red card.",
      "\"I don't agree with that sending off. We can fight with team-mates. I know it's violent conduct, the referee explained it, I don't agree with that. I hope my players, when they lose the ball, they fight each other. I hope they don't get sent off, but that is a good feeling not a bad feeling.",
      "\"My players showed in many games we can do it. Today, we didn't. I need to help them. We need to be better in the future.\"",
      "\"It's complacency, and complacency will kill you. The minute that you think as a football player that you just have to turn up on that pitch and you're Manchester United and you can play or any football club, you're done.",
      "\"It just smelt of complacency. They weren't at it from the beginning. That is a bad one for United.",
      "\"You can't go from the fight that they showed in certain games to that. It just erodes confidence, it erodes trust. We're trying to build a trust in a manager, we're trying to build a trust in a team.",
      "\"The fans booed collectively at the end. It was loud, and rightly so. That was a really poor performance. It's almost as if you've gone sort of like two or three steps forward, everyone's feeling a little bit better about themselves, and you've just gone back to the start again.",
      "\"You can lose football matches, but you can't lose them like that. That's nowhere near good enough, it's not acceptable.\"",
      "\"If nothing happened, I don't think anyone in the stadium would have been surprised. I thought the referee could have taken a bit longer to think about it.",
      "\"I got told that the rules of the game that if you slap your own player, you could be in trouble.",
      "\"But there's another side to it: I like my players fighting each other, if someone didn't do the right action. If you want that toughness and resilience to get a result, you want someone to act on it.",
      "\"I'm disappointed we get the sending off. But we've all been footballers, we get angry with our team-mates. He's apologised for the sending off, he's praised the players and thanked them for it and apologised for what happened.\"",
      "\"Rollercoaster game. I'll sleep well tonight, put it that way. So genuinely happy for the lads and how hard they worked. A fantastic performance of gritting away, getting a goal and keeping that spirit. So glad we got the three points.",
      "\"We started really well - the situation happened. It was a moment of madness, avoidable. But all I can say is Idrissa has apologised to us at full-time, said his piece and that's all he can do. We move on from it. The reaction from us, was unbelievable. Top tier. We could have crumbled but if anything, it made us grow.",
      "On what Moyes said at half-time: \"He just said: that's done now. We'll deal with that another time.",
      "\"It was about keeping to the plan we had. He made sure we do the right things, continue what we're dong, we can't change that now, in the second half we continued to do that.\"",
