      "Manchester United are riding the high of three rare victories on the bounce ahead of this weekend’s Premier League fixture. Recent wins against Sunderland, Liverpool and Brighton have marked Ruben Amorim’s best spell since he took the reins exactly a year ago.",
      "The Red Devils will be hoping that form continues when they make the trip to Nottingham Forest on Saturday afternoon. Amorim will be well aware that Forest have struggled all season long and a win over a team that recently appointed their third manager of the campaign will take them even beyond their current sixth-place standing.",
      "Barcelona goalkeeper Wojciech Szczesny has revealed how impressed he has been with Marcus Rashford since the United loanee’s move to Spain in the summer. The forward, 28, has scored five goals and notched another seven assists in 13 games already this season for Hansi Flick’s side.",
      "Rashford has made no secret of the fact he wants to secure a permanent move to Barcelona at the end of this season. And he appears to be on the right path, with Szczesny providing a glimpse into how Rashford has been carrying himself in training and in matches.",
      "\"He's an excellent player, I love him a lot,\" he said. \"Direct in his play, attacks with speed, and he's contributed to a lot of goals. I think he's a complete player, and I remember him since he was 18 or 19 in the Premier League. I knew he was special back then.\"",
      "The Polish goalkeeper added: \"He has fewer goals than he deserves, because in training, when he's having a good day, you can't stop him. If he shows that magical right foot more in matches, he'll be very dangerous.\"",
      "Wayne Rooney has shed light on the best advice Sir Alex Ferguson ever gave him. The striker played under the former Old Trafford boss for nine years, winning five Premier League titles and the Champions League.",
      "Despite a sometimes strained relationship, there is no doubt that the Scot played a crucial role in developing Rooney into the legendary striker he became. And the BBC pundit has now recalled one memorable conversation he had with Sir Alex during his career that sticks with him today.",
      "Rooney said on the latest episode of The Wayne Rooney Show: ”I always remember the one thing he said and he said it a few times, ‘The hardest thing to do in life is work hard.’ That stuck with me. Whatever job you're doing, that can apply to anything really.",
      "“I think in football we have talent, we have ability, but sometimes we don't look at working hard every day. And you'd think that's normal. You should do that if you play at a big club. But some players don't. And so that was the one thing which stuck with me.”",
      "Former United star Nani has refused to rule Amorim’s side out of the title race this season. The 38-year-old former winger, who won four league titles in his seven seasons with the club, made the hugely optimistic comment in light of the Red Devils’ recent form.",
      "Discussing a potential title charge, he told Covers.com: “Why not? They are building a strong team and are trying to get back into real competition with the teams that are always at the top of the table: Arsenal, Liverpool, Chelsea, and Man City.",
      "\"So, they are there now. They have the possibility. If they win the next few games, everything can change. So, we never know. Let’s keep on winning games and then we’ll see.”",
      "Given that they are already six points off leaders Arsenal, predicting a title push this season seems somewhat premature, but Nani claims the lack of European football could aid his former side. The Portuguese added: “If it’s not this year, maybe they will get the confidence for next season. So, let’s see.",
      "“Not being in Europe helps on one side, yes, but obviously everyone likes to see the team in European competitions because in the middle of the week, when you don’t see your team there, you get frustrated.”",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Manchester United will look to maintain their recent Premier League surge following three consecutive victories, though Liverpool legend Emile Heskey reckons they're not realistic challengers for anything beyond an eighth-place finish.",
      "Triumphs over Sunderland, Liverpool and Brighton have boosted morale within the squad, with a challenging away fixture at the City Ground against Nottingham Forest up next. The East Midlands outfit suffered their maiden league defeat under new boss Sean Dyche - a 2-0 defeat to high-flying Bournemouth last weekend.",
      "United are displaying encouraging signs of improvement under Ruben Amorim, chalking up three successive victories - their first such run since between May to August 2024. The positive atmosphere has returned to Old Trafford as they occupy sixth position in the standings.",
      "Nevertheless, Heskey reckons the immediate target for United should be clinching a top-eight spot in the Premier League. Discussing their recent upturn in form, Heskey told Dream Vegas: \"He [Amorim] adapted to the way he needed to play against Liverpool, so it looks like he's understanding a bit more the squad and understanding a bit more the players and understanding a bit more the league as well.",
      "\"I do believe that they see something in him that they believe is long-term, so I don't see them sacking him. The next step is probably top eight, and then just keep putting their foot on the pedal and moving up the table to where they believe a club of the stature of Manchester United should be.",
      "\"They should be challenging in the top four eventually, but at this moment, they're miles off that. The next step top eight and then get top six. I think that's a successful season for me.\"",
      "Amorim has been under the microscope throughout his time at Old Trafford, but a trio of vital victories appear to have temporarily quelled doubts about his role.",
      "\"It was a journey, a big journey,\" Amorim reflected on his inaugural year at the helm. \"It was tough, really tough, good moments and bad moments.",
      "\"I learned a lot that is really important. I found out that even in my lower moments I can stick with the things I believe and that is a good thing for anyone to understand. Today the answer is different from three weeks ago.",
      "\"One of the biggest honours of my life to be here and I want to continue here for many years.\" United's trip to Forest will mark one year since Amorim took over the reins, succeeding Erik ten Hag as manager.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Former Manchester United assistant manager Rene Meulensteen reckons Ruben Amorim's squad remain in contention for the Premier League crown. The Red Devils are six points adrift of table-toppers Arsenal and have strung together three consecutive victories under the Portuguese boss.",
      "Currently sitting sixth, United trail local rivals Manchester City and Tottenham Hotspur, along with surprise contenders Bournemouth and Sunderland. Life at Old Trafford has been challenging after experiencing some of their most difficult displays in the club's top-flight history.",
      "Meulensteen reckons the new arrivals are starting to find their feet, and with the benefit of no midweek European commitments, the Dutchman believes this campaign could mark their return to prominence in England's elite division.",
      "\"When I first said that, I'm 100 per cent sure people were scratching their heads and asking what is he talking about? But the reason why I was saying it, and I still back it now, is that if you look at it United are only six points behind Arsenal,\" he told compare.bet.",
      "\"Yes, people sometimes get blindsided by how poor of a start United had but they are starting to gain momentum.",
      "\"I can see them also beating Forest and Spurs and suddenly that's five games in a row and they start to look stronger and stronger because Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo are settling in. [Benjamin] Sesko is going to get his minutes on the clock. They're finding their way bit by bit and that confidence will grow.",
      "\"They've got no midweek games, no midweek stress. They don't have to do a lot of squad rotation.",

      "United are back in Premier League action on Saturday when they host Sean Dyche's Nottingham Forest. Victory would make it four successive wins and strengthen their bid for Champions League football.",
      "Despite being in sixth placed, Meulensteen insists they are well placed to maintain their momentum as potential dark horses. He added: \"They might not say it themselves, and they might not believe it yet, but I honestly think they can do it.",
      "\"I've been one of the biggest critics for the reasons why they haven't kicked on because of Amorim's stubbornness with the system but if they do go on a run and everything clicks then you have to hold your hands up and say Amorim, listen, fantastic job. You stuck to your system and it's working.",
      "\"Has it got longevity? I still have my doubts. However in sport it can come down to factors you can't quite put your finger on. Form, flow, karma. Look what's happening to Liverpool. Last year, nobody would have seen what has happened now. It was just easy sailing. Now they're in the worst storm they could have ever imagined and maybe don't know how to get out.",
      "\"United have had these bad spells and suddenly, for whatever reason, something is starting to fall into place and people gain form and the negatives are turned into positives. That's the role United can play this season, and it wouldn't surprise me to see them in contention for the title. I would love to see them emerge from this dark horse position because nobody gave them a dime to do anything this season.",
      "\"It would be a great position to be in unless suddenly something bad happens and they fall back into a run of not performing and winning. The three wins haven't cemented the base that we all would love to see just yet.",
      "\"Do not underestimate the time that Amorim will now have to work with the players and work on the plan for the next opponent rather than managing a two day turnover between games in Europe and in the league. He will now have five to six days turnover. Sometimes seven.",

      "Manchester United minority shareholder Sir Jim Ratcliffe was reportedly left unimpressed by the list of candidates for his previous managerial decision. Ruben Amorim is nearing the one-year mark of his tenure at Old Trafford and, almost exactly 12 months on, he's finally hitting his stride as the club's head coach.",
      "The appointment from Sporting CP was made with Dan Ashworth, Omar Berrada and Jason Wilcox in the hierarchy but Ashworth, the former Newcastle United chief, left the club abruptly shortly after Amorim's arrival. Despite facing pressure at points last season and during the current campaign, the Portuguese tactician has weathered the storm to guide United to three consecutive wins and on the brink of the top four.",
      "However, it could have been a different story according to The Guardian, a Premier League shortlist was drawn up which featured Eddie Howe, Graham Potter and Thomas Frank. The report adds that suggestions over Gareth Southgate's prospects to become the man in the Old Trafford hotseat were played down by United sources.",
      "The former England manager was also linked as a potential replacement for Amorim recently. As was Newcastle boss Howe.",
      "Reports suggest that Ratcliffe deemed the shortlist \"uninspiring\" as he turned to Ashworth for a definitive roster of potential successors. Yet the report indicates that Erik Ten Hag's struggles and the hunt for his replacement sparked a revelation from United's chief that Ashworth wasn't the figure he envisioned spearheading the club's future.",
      "The ex-Newcastle sporting director allegedly advised against making a bold appointment and presented a catalogue of Premier League contenders before United plumped for Amorim. Following the Europa League final defeat last season and a dismal Premier League star, plus the stunning Carabao Cup loss to Grimsby Town, speculation intensified around the 40-year-old's prospects.",
      "Nevertheless there has been a revival in fortunes and it arrives just weeks after Ratcliffe spoke openly to back Amorim and dismiss suggestions he might face the managerial axe. \"He has not had the best of seasons,\" he told The Business podcast.",
      "\"Ruben needs to demonstrate he is a great coach over three years. That's where I would be. The press, sometimes I don't understand. They want overnight success.",
      "\"They think it's a light switch. You know, you flick a switch and it's all going to be roses tomorrow.",
      "\"You can't run a club like Manchester United on kneejerk reactions to some journalist who goes off on one every week.\"",

      "A smiling Ruben Amorim breezed into Manchester United 12 months ago admitting he loved to dream. But it didn't take too long for the Portuguese to realise he was living a nightmare.",
      "Amorim's honeymoon period might well be the shortest in living memory. Portman Road was packed to the rafters to witness his first game in charge, when United travelled to take on Ipswich Town.",
      "And when Marcus Rashford scored after just 81 seconds, following a sweeping and sensational move which ripped Ipswich to pieces, members of the media looked at each other in the press box like United had hit the managerial jackpot.",
      "Then it all started to go wrong. United failed to win that game - and headed home following a frustrating 1-1 draw. Bonfire Night had been and gone, but a fire would start to rage at United. And for months on end, Amorim proceeded to pour petrol on it.",
      "Stubborn to the extreme, Amorim persisted with his tactical beliefs and obsession with how football should be played. The problem was, he just didn't have the players either capable, or willing, to carry out his instructions.",
      "Over the Christmas and New Year period of 2024, United went six games without a win. From April 1, United had become even worse, following a run of seven matches without a win.",
      "And the biggest fools at Old Trafford appeared to be Amorim and the bloke who appointed him, Sir Jim Ratcliffe. There were excuses Amorim could lean on, even if he refused to.",
      "He took the job during a season, when he didn't want to. He'd had no pre-season to work with his squad - and wanted to start the role in the summer of 2025.",
      "But Ratcliffe had been insistent. And to make matters worse, Amorim had inherited a squad which, unbeknown to him, had become toxic from within.",
      "It culminated in United failing to secure European qualification, let alone winning silverware, Amorim facing increasing speculation he would be sacked, and the man himself having to block a group of five players who wanted out, from returning to pre-season training.",
      "That 'Bomb Squad' just happened to include Rashford, the bloke who'd handed Amorim that dream start all those months ago in Suffolk. Rashford has now gone, along with the likes of Jadon Sancho and Alejandro Garnacho.",
      "Amorim might have felt locked into a thankless task at times, but he has taken no prisoners when it comes to ridding United of divisive influences. He's been honest at all times. Too honest, perhaps.",
      "He warned supporters there would be more hardships ahead. He claimed his United might just be the worst one on record, were in a relegation battle, and that he felt \"embarrassed\" to be responsible for so many defeats.",
      "Amorim even offered to resign if Ratcliffe & Co thought a huge mistake had been made. But Ratcliffe held his nerve. He made it clear how long Amorim needed to get the English giants back to the big time.",
      "And as Amorim reaches his first anniversary, he does so with genuine signs he's turned a corner. That happier times are ahead. He masterminded a stunning win over champions Liverpool at Anfield.",
      "And following three straight league wins, United find themselves sixth in the table, above their bitter rivals, and just six points adrift of leaders Arsenal. It's been one heck of a rollercoaster ride.",
      "One with far more lows than highs, to leave all those associated with United feeling quite nauseous at times. But Amorim has at least shown he has the stomach for the fight ahead.",
      "And from the wreckage of the last 12 months and beyond, he appears to be building something, that might just make all the pain he's been through worthwhile.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Manchester United goalkeeper Senne Lammens has opened up about how he's adapted to life alongside his new team-mates. The 23-year-old summer arrival has provided much-needed steadiness as United's new number one, with previous first-choice Andre Onana being sent out on loan to Trabzonspor.",
      "The choice to bring in Lammens to address United's goalkeeping troubles on deadline day came as a shock to many, considering his limited top-level experience. He had only established himself as Royal Antwerp's first choice last season and has yet to earn his first international cap for Belgium.",
      "The assurance that his early displays have instilled in the squad feels worlds away from the anxiety that frequently accompanied Onana's stint between the sticks, and Lammens has revealed he has already earned the trust of his United colleagues.",
      "\"Honestly? I was a bit scared at first,\" Lammens told Belgian outlet HLN. \"You always think players at big clubs are more independent. And that you're more on your own.",
      "\"The opposite is true. Everyone welcomed me. Captain Bruno Fernandes, a player I look up to, immediately reassured me. But of course, you have to perform. If you really want to be embraced by the team, you have to prove yourself. And so far, that's worked.\"",
      "Lammens getting encouraging slaps on the back from the United defence has become a regular sight during his opening trio of matches.",
      "\"That was the best part of the past few weeks,\" Lammens said. \"You're playing with guys who have a lot of experience. Big names in football. When they show they're happy with you in goal, it gives them a lot of confidence. I've been able to give them the feeling they can count on me.\"",
      "Whilst Lammens is thriving in his position as United's first choice, his predecessor Onana is also relishing his spell away from Old Trafford. The 29-year-old's final outing for United before his loan departure was in the club's shock Carabao Cup elimination to Grimsby.",
      "The ex-Ajax and Inter Milan shot-stopper has subsequently turned out six times for Trabzonspor, where his distribution skills have earned plaudits. In what seemed like a subtle dig at United, Onana suggested his improved displays were down to his new environment.",
      "\"As I always say, most of the time, it's my teammates who give me the options when I'm building up the game,\" he said, per Sporx (via Sport Witness). \"If they help me, the work looks much better.\"",
      "Meanwhile, Lammens will be concentrating on helping United prolong their winning streak this weekend. Amorim's squad are scheduled to take on Nottingham Forest at the City Ground on Saturday.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Barcelona are said to be tracking Manchester United-linked Karl Etta Eyong as a potential long-term successor to Robert Lewandowski – a move which could impact Marcus Rashford's future at the Nou Camp. The Red Devils loanee has enjoyed an excellent start to life in Spain.",
      "Rashford has netted five times and provided seven assists in 13 outings so far this season. The temporary switch includes an option for the La Liga giants to make his stay permanent at the end of the season, which is believed to be in the region of £26.2m (€30m).",
      "Both club and player are understood to be satisfied with the arrangement, and barring any setbacks, the England international is expected to complete a permanent transfer to the Nou Camp. Hansi Flick has predominantly deployed Rashford on the left, with Lewandowski operating through the middle and Raphinha on the right.",
      "However, the Englishman demonstrated his versatility by excelling in a central role during a win over Olympiacos in the UEFA Champions League earlier this month. Speaking to reporters after the 6-1 thrashing, Flick commented on Rashford's versatility.",
      "\"Marcus can be a No.9 or a No.11,\" said the Barcelona boss. \"When we think of him, we value the fact that he can play in more than one position. He has given us a lot of positives and, of course, he can play as a centre-forward.\"",
      "Lewandowski has been managed carefully by the Spanish champions in what might prove to be his final season at the club. It remains unclear whether the 37-year-old striker will pen a contract extension, but speculation has already begun to circulate, suggesting the club is preparing for his exit.",
      "The report suggests that the release clause for Spanish clubs is set at €30m (£26.4m), while Premier League teams would have to pay a significantly higher €40m (£35.2m) to secure his services. Having kicked off the season with Villarreal before switching to Levante at the end of the summer transfer window, Eyong would be ineligible to play for Barcelona if they were to snap him up in January.",
      "Fanatics has slashed up to 60% off football kits and merch. Until Sunday, fans can find discounts on products from Premier League clubs including Man United, Man City, Liverpool, Everton, Arsenal, Spurs and more.",
      "This is due to La Liga regulations, which permit players to represent more than two teams in a single season. For Rashford, Eyong's potential arrival might not cause much of a stir. His adaptability on the pitch has already been praised by Flick, with his ability to operate both out wide and centrally likely to prove advantageous.",
      "The United loanee will be hoping to continue his excellent vein of form when Barcelona return to action this weekend. On Sunday afternoon, the Catalan giants will host Elche as they look to get back to winning ways after losing to Real Madrid in El Clascio.",

      "Manchester United goalkeeper Senne Lammens has responded to the new nickname given to him by fans of his new club. The Belgian shot-stopper joined the Premier League side during the summer alongside a raft of high profile recruitments which included the likes of Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha.",
      "Earlier in the month, Lammens' former coach Hayk Milkon said he could become the best goalkeeper in the world. He also noted that he'd noticed articles describing the \"boring\" clothes Lammens wore when reporting to international duty, but he insisted \"it's just the way Senne is\", adding that it emphasises his calm nature and ability to keep his feet on the ground as an elite sportsman.",
      "Now, in a new interview, Lammens himself was asked about a new nickname - 'The Boring One'. Of course, he has affectionately been given this nickname.",
      "\"I understand I might come across as 'boring,' but that's the goalkeeper I want to be,\" he said, while grinning, to Belgian media outlet HLN. \"I don't do anything crazy. In recent years, players have come through here who... weren't boring. But I want to stand for consistency. Staying calm, in good times and bad.",
      "\"If you want a successful career, you have to have that quality, I think. I saw that in Simon Mignolet (at Club Brugge) and Jean Butez (at Antwerp). They were my role models. I was able to steal from them with my eyes.\"",
      "When asked if he's queried Thibaut Courtois for advice, he nodded, before answering: \"We talked about English football during the last international break, together with Matz Sels. They know what it's like to be a goalkeeper in the Premier League. Being able to train with them in the national team also makes me better.\"",
      "United fans have also been chanting \"Are you Schmeichel in disguise?\" referring to legendary 'keeper Peter Schmeichel. When asked about this in his interview, he revealed he loves the praise.",
      "He explained: \"It was wonderful to hear the supporters sing that to me. A huge compliment, especially after my first match. But I'm not getting too carried away with their enthusiasm. I still have a lot to prove to be mentioned in the same breath as Peter Schmeichel, you know.\"",
      "Despite speaking with such maturity, Lammens is still only 23 and has played just one full season of senior football. He signed for The Red Devils on transfer deadline day after a drawn out saga that linked Emiliano Martinez with the Old Trafford club.",
      "Seen as the less luxurious option as a goalkeeper, the transfer has worked out so far with plenty of positives to take from his first few months in the north west.",
      "Next up for United is a short away trip to the Midlands, where they'll face Sean Dyche's Nottingham Forest. With nine games played, United are in sixth place with 16 points.",

      "Manchester United star Senne Lammens claims Peter Schmeichel’s suggestion that they should NOT have signed him ‘makes sense’. The Belgian goalkeeper was signed in a £18m deal with Royal Antwerp in the summer as the Red Devils attempted to fix their problem position.",
      "Lammens has since firmly established himself as Ruben Amorim’s number one following a series of standout performances at Old Trafford. Despite that, United icon Schmeichel had some reservations and suggested that the club should have looked at more experienced options.",
      "Speaking this summer, he said: “As for Lammens, I’ll be honest, I’d never heard of him until the link came up. I know his stats are excellent across the top 10 European leagues. But that was with Antwerp in Belgium, in a team that finished fifth.",
      "Schmeichel added: “Lammens could turn out to be the best signing ever – but right now, it feels like a hopeful one, and that’s not what United need at this moment in time.",
      "“If we’d signed him alongside Martinez, that would have made perfect sense: a proven World Cup winner as number one, with a talented young keeper developing behind him. But instead, we’re left asking who’s going to be number one.”",
      "And Lammens has now responded by joking about Schmeichel’s comments, while he also claimed he might have had a point. On their meeting, he said to Belgian outlet HLN : “Weren’t you the one who said they should have bought Donnarumma or Martinez?",
      "“No, not really. It makes sense that he also had reservations. When I signed, he simply didn’t know me yet. I don’t think he had watched many Antwerp matches.",
      "“During one of the first matches he came to the sidelines for a little chat. He was very friendly. He tried to make me feel at ease, said I just had to do my thing and give confidence to my defence.”",
      "Lammens has made three appearances for the Red Devils so far, keeping one clean sheet. United fans have hailed him by chanting ‘are you Schmeichel in disguise’. While Lammens is happy with the praise, he is not getting too far ahead of himself.",
      "He added: “That’s England for you. If things go badly, they can bury you deep, but if things go well, they praise you to the skies.",
      "“I take that with a grain of salt, because to be mentioned in the same sentence as Schmeichel, I’m going to have to prove myself many more times. But I did find it a very nice compliment.",
      "“I hope to play here for 10 years and be important, so that, like Schmeichel and Van der Sar, I can leave a legacy.”",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Alan Shearer believes that Jadon Sancho’s poor attitude could be the reason behind his struggles after his Aston Villa embarrassment on the weekend. The Manchester United loanee was introduced as a substitute against Manchester City only to be hooked later on by manager Unai Emery.",
      "Sancho has made a slow start to life at Villa in his third loan spell away from United in the past few years. Villa took a punt on the winger on transfer deadline day in September after he spent last season with Chelsea, where he contributed five goals and 10 assists in 41 games.",
      "The 25-year-old is desperate to secure some regular game time, but that hasn’t materialised yet – and his opportunity against City turned into something very different. Sancho was sent on to replace the injured Emi Buendia in the first half but then suffered the humiliation of being taken off with 16 minutes still to play.",
      "That was his second substitute appearance in the Premier League for Villa, with his game time totalling just 52 minutes. Premier League record goalscorer Shearer has little sympathy and believes the United loanee simply needs to knuckle down and prove himself to Emery in order to turn things around.",
      "Shearer told Betfair: \"I don't know what's going on with Jadon Sancho in terms of his training or his life, but he's got an opportunity at Villa now, and if it doesn't work out here, people will look back and say, 'Hang on, you've been given so many opportunities.' You can only have so many.",
      "\"I guess it is humiliating when you're put on as a sub and then taken off again. It hasn't worked out yet for him, but there's only one way around it and that is hard work. Get your head down, get your attitude right, and if you do that, things will turn around.\"",
      "Emery admitted that his decision was \"embarrassing\" for Sancho, but explained that he isn’t the first player to go through it. “Yes, sure he's (Sancho) not happy but I did it before with Morgan Rogers, with Emiliano Buendia, with Leon Bailey, and he played 60 minutes on Thursday,” Emery said after the 1-0 win.",
      "“Today when he (Buendia) was injured, my plan was maybe in case he (Sancho) was going to play 30 minutes, but I decided to play more and he played 45 minutes. But my plan was when he was swapped with Emiliano Buendia, the idea was maybe not playing all the minutes until the last moment. And I told him as well, he can feel it, it's embarrassing.”",
      "While Shearer believes hard work is the route forward, former Liverpool striker Emile Heskey has suggested Sancho needs to find his way back to Borussia Dortmund, where he has shown the best form of his career, before a £73million move to United derailed things.",
      "“Jadon has a great rapport with Dortmund in the Bundesliga, so that is an avenue he could go down,” he said. “When he went back on loan there, he was in the Champions League final. So it's possible, and you would think he could always go back there, especially on a free transfer.”",

      "Paul Scholes has expressed his gratitude for the outpouring of support he has received after opening up about caring for his 20-year-old son Aiden, who has autism. The former Manchester United star confirmed this week that he has quit live TV work to focus on spending time with his son.",
      "Scholes made the revelation in a candid and emotional episode of the \"Stick to Football\" podcast, alongside his former teammates Gary Neville and Roy Keane. The 50-year-old, who also revealed that he had split from his wife of 26 years, Claire, explained that stepping away from media work would help his son, who is non-verbal, maintain his routines.",
      "In a heartfelt Instagram post, Scholes thanked those who had shown him support following the announcement of his major career decision.",
      "He wrote: \"Would just like to thank everyone for all your kind messages since the Overlap interview regarding Aiden. There's been loads and tried to read as many as possible.",
      "\"The response from families (especially Dads) shows how much speaking about it helps so many... There was one quote from a parent in a similar position that's just got me... 'my job is to stay alive for one day longer than my son/daughter'. Anyway, it's the weekend, let's have a few drinks and watch the football. Come on, Salford.\"",
      "During the podcast, Scholes, who has regularly worked as a pundit or commentator for a number of broadcasters since retiring in 2013, revealed how his son's needs had reshaped his work commitments. \"I made a decision this year 'cos of Aiden,\" he shared.",
      "\"Obviously, due to his special needs, you might know about. All the work I do now is just around his routines, 'cos he has quite a strict routine every single day, so I just decided everything I'm going to do is around Aiden.\"",
      "Scholes further clarified: \"Everything I'm going to do now just works around him. I do studio work, but everything is built around his day.",
      "\"Last season on Thursday nights, I'd do the Europa League for Man United, that's the night I'd usually have him, so he was getting all agitated, biting and scratching. He knows the pattern's not there straight away.",
      "\"And I did that for years, really, always thinking I've got to stop this at some point, so I had the chance to do the podcast (The Good, The Bad and The Football), and I thought that would suit me more - well, not me, Aiden.\"",
      "Scholes also discussed his weekly routine following his split from Claire, Aiden's mother and his wife of 26 years. \"I'm not with Claire anymore,\" he said, \"so we have him three nights each, and Claire's mum has him on a Friday night.",
      "\"We always do the same things with him, as he doesn't know what day or time of the week it is. But he'll know from what we're doing what day it is.",
      "\"I pick him up every Tuesday from his day care, and we go swimming. Loves swimming, then we get his pizza on the way home.",
      "\"Thursday, pick him up, go for something to eat, and go home. Sunday, I pick him up from Claire's house, and we go to Tesco, where he buys a trolley full of chocolate.",
      "\"So, he doesn't know what day or time it is, but he knows from what we're doing what day it is. He'll be 21 in December.\"",

      "Erling Haaland wasn't included in Wayne Rooney's hypothetical current Premier League five-a-side team, as the Manchester United legend opened up on his playing and managerial career. The England legend recently launched The Wayne Rooney Show with the BBC.",
      "And in the most recent instalment, Wazza took part in a Q&A session as fans worldwide were keen on picking his brain. On top of speaking about his tenure at Old Trafford under the legendary Sir Alex Ferguson and his stance on Rockport boots, Rooney was asked who would make his five-a-side team if he had to select a squad of current Premier League stars.",
      "The 40-year-old was quick to pick Manchester City talent Phil Foden as the first name on his team sheet, before justifying his selection by saying: \"It would be 5-a-side, Phil Foden... tight areas, brilliant.\"",
      "Rooney then listed Cole Palmer, Moises Caicedo, Bukayo Saka and Mohamed Salah to make up the rest of his side - hilariously snubbing the option to take a goalkeeper.",
      "However, in doing so, he surprisingly omitted any Manchester United stars currently performing under Ruben Amorim - despite the likes of Bruno Fernandes, Amad Diallo and Bryan Mbeumo excelling as of recent.",
      "When Kae Kurd was asked by Kelly Somers to pick up on Rooney's choices, the comedian added: \"Do you know what? I would pick Haaland though, just purely because of the fact he's so big and whatever. I'm going for like outmuscling the rest of the lads, and I think Haaland is quite big.\"",
      "However, Rooney then noted how in such a small space, the likes of Foden, Saka and Palmer would knock the ball around taller players, saying that Haaland \"wouldn't get near them\" or the ball.",
      "Kurd then added that he would take Kobbie Mainoo, with Rooney agreeing: \"Yeah, Kobbie would be good,\" before Somers joked: \"So he got some minutes?\" nodding to limited game-time seen under Amorim as of late.",
      "Elsewhere in the show, Rooney was asked by a fan what his biggest career regret was. Looking toward his managerial terms rather than his playing days, the Englishman highlighted how he rues the circumstances in which he took the Birmingham City role.",
      "After enjoying coaching stints with Derby County and DC United, Rooney took up tenure with Birmingham in October 2023 on a three-year deal. There, he succeeded John Eustace, who had helped the Blues achieve their highest points tally since 2016 and built an incredible rapport with fans before he was dismissed due to a \"misalignment with the leadership of the Club.\"",
      "Speaking about joining Birmingham, Rooney said: \"Biggest regret was the timing I went into Birmingham. It was in management. For sure. And the whole thing about it really is probably what I regret.",
      "\"The owners were great, from that point of view. It was just the timing and John Eustace was doing a good job and obviously that's nothing to do with me when they got rid of John.",
      "\"But going in at the time, and the fans like John. And they'd started okay in the league and I just wouldn't do it again if I was in that situation again.\"",
      "Rooney lasted just 15 games at St Andrews before he was handed his walking papers in January 2024, with Birmingham ultimately facing relegation to League One as the season drew to a close. However, he wasn't out of a job for long, finding himself appointed the manager of Plymouth Argyle just months later in the May.",
      "It wasn't meant to be for Rooney, however, as he left the club by mutual agreement last December, having won just five games from 25 matches. He is yet to return to management since, instead seemingly focusing on punditry.",

      "Borini made the purchase four years ago after Woodward was targeted by a gang of supporters who were discontent over how he was running the Red Devils. A smoke bomb and fireworks were set off at the property in 2020 in chaotic scenes.",
      "The mob also rang an intercom on the large gates at the entrance to the home before spraying it with red paint in unsettling visuals. Woodward, his wife, and their young twins were not at home when lit flares were thrown into the grounds.",
      "When the former United chief executive was ready to sell, Borini was more than happy to capitalise on the concerns of other prospective buyers. The forward, who was playing his trade with Turkish side Fatih Karagumruk in 2021, is now able to share the home with his wife Erin and his two young children, Stella and Lando.",
      "Borini said: “We bought the house four years ago, actually from the former CEO of Man United, Woodward.",
      "“Because of the protests outside, everybody was worried, so I said, ‘Don’t worry I’ll buy it, get the price down!'\"",
      "The Cheshire home has come in clutch with Borini now playing for Salford City in League Two. The 34-year-old last spent two years with Sampdoria in Serie B but made just 11 appearances last term after scoring nine goals in 23 matches in his first term.",
      "Borini was more than happy to embrace Salford's project and to provide his own input into the team. A summer conversation saw him sign on the dotted line earlier this month.",
      "He told the Times: “I spoke with Alex over the summer about the possibility and said I’m open to the opportunity of coming to Salford even if it was League Two.",

      "Dads across the world can rejoice at the news that even David Beckham embarrasses his kids at times. The England and Manchester United legend has one of the most recognisable faces on the planet, but even 'Golden Balls' is capable of cringe.",
      "Beckham's \"heartbreaking\" moment of realisation came after one particular school run. And it was after daughter Harper asked to be dropped off slightly away from the school that he discovered he wasn't as cool as he'd perhaps like.",
      "Wife Victoria made the revelation during an appearance on the Armchair Expert podcast in 2022. David has in the past made fun of his partner for getting dropped off at school by father Tony in a Rolls Royce as a child, and Victoria harked back to those times.",
      "\"We had the Rolls Royce, but because he was an electrical wholesaler he also had a van,\" she said. \"Me and my sister used to say like 'please drop us [off] in the van.'",
      "\"I think more kids at school were being dropped off in a van and so when we were in the Rolls, we'd be like 'oh please drop us down the road.' Nowadays, I'd be like literally pull up right to the front gate. And I'd be proud to get out of that Rolls.\"",
      "Harper, who was 11 at the time of recording, had her own similar moment of realisation after hitting the same point in her development. And the episode left its mark on Beckham as he struggled to come to terms with the fact his daughter was growing up.",
      "\"David was having this conversation the other day when he was dropping off Harper,\" Victoria continued. \"She was like, 'Daddy can you drop me a little bit away from the school?'",
      "She went on to say David was \"heartbroken\" before explaining: \"She's our youngest daughter, and he was like, 'Oh really, this is happening.' And then he was like, 'If it's uncool that David Beckham's your dad...' I mean let's be honest, what hope do most of the other kids have?\"",
      "Dads worldwide can take comfort from the fact even David Beckham isn't exempt from being sidelined. The former Real Madrid and LA Galaxy midfielder wasn't accustomed to playing a background role on the park, but fatherhood can clearly be more brutal than any manager.",
      "That being said, if there's anyone who can get away with distancing themselves from Dad, it's Harper. The Beckhams have three older sons in Brooklyn, 26, Romeo, 23, and Cruz, 20, but it's their 14-year-old daughter who will always be the apple of David's eye.",
      "\"Having a daughter is a whole new thing: it changes you,\" he once said of his experience being a girl-dad. \"I have no power with that little girl, no power whatsoever.",
      "\"I love all my children, of course, equally. But I am definitely stricter with the boys than I am with Harper. I can’t say no to her. I think I only said no to her once; her bottom lip started shivering and I was like: 'Never again.'",
      "\"She’s amazing. She’s a princess with Victoria – obviously she’s a big mummy’s girl – but she’s also a big daddy’s girl, which I love. I think she’s the best.\"",

      "Despite Iraola insisting he is happy at Bournemouth, the coach will continue to be linked with other clubs as his contract nears its end. With his future remaining uncertain, the 43-year-old has already explained that he does not take a short-term approach to his managerial career.",

      "Barcelona goalkeeper Wojciech Szczęsny has lifted the lid on just how brilliant Marcus Rashford has been in training since his switch from Manchester United, branding the England star 'unstoppable'. Rashford made the move to the Spanish giants on a season-long loan deal during the summer, with Barcelona holding a £26.2million option to make the transfer permanent.",
      "The 28-year-old has netted five times and laid on seven assists in 13 appearances for Hansi Flick's side this campaign. Since the start of the season, he has made no secret of his ambition to seal a permanent switch to the Nou Camp when his loan spell concludes.",
      "Now Szczęsny has become the latest figure to sing Rashford's praises, offering insight into the forward's attitude and displays during training sessions.",
      "Despite Rashford's high number of goal contributions, Szczęsny thinks the England star 'deserves more' considering what he's been doing to his Barcelona team-mates in training.",
      "Chatting to Barcelona's official YouTube channel, the ex-Arsenal shot-stopper said: \"He's an excellent player, I love him a lot.",
      "\"Direct in his play, attacks with speed, and he's contributed to a lot of goals. I think he's a complete player, and I remember him since he was 18 or 19 in the Premier League. I knew he was special back then.\"",
      "He added: \"He has fewer goals than he deserves, because in training, when he's having a good day, you can't stop him. If he shows that magical right foot more in matches, he'll be very dangerous.\"",
      "Szczęsny's glowing praise of Rashford's training ethic follows further commendation at Aston Villa. After joining in the January transfer window, the forward contributed to 10 goals in 17 matches before an injury limited his playing time.",
      "Cole Brannigan, an Under-18s striker who often trained with Rashford, confessed in a chat with The News Letter that the United loanee is \"by far the best player\" he had witnessed technically with the ball. \"He was absolutely ridiculous,\" he exclaimed.",
      "\"I couldn't believe what I was seeing. We have a family group chat and I just put in 'Marcus Rashford is absolutely ridiculous'. Having Marcus Rashford at the club, he's someone for me to look up to.\"",

      "Manchester United are in a confident mood after earning three consecutive Premier League wins. It is the club’s best run of league results since Ruben Amorim took charge last year, and the Red Devils will hope to extend their good form against Nottingham Forest this weekend.",
      "After a slow start to the campaign, United lifted themselves to sixth in the table through their 4-2 victory over Brighton. Goals from Matheus Cunha, Casemiro and a Bryan Mbeumo brace contributed to the feel-good performance at Old Trafford.",
      "The summer additions of Cunha and Mbeumo have helped bolster United’s frontline, while young forward Benjamin Sesko has also continued his development. Following the team’s string of positive results, United’s director of football Jason Wilcox has given an insight into the club’s future transfer strategy.",
      "Jadon Sancho endured the unfortunate experience of being replaced after coming on as a first-half substitute during Aston Villa’s win over Manchester City on Sunday. The 25-year-old came under scrutiny following his 45-minute display, though Villa manager Unai Emery explained that the decision was made to help with Sancho’s fitness levels.",
      "The former Borussia Dortmund star was one of the most coveted players in European football when he completed his £73million transfer to United. He has since struggled to reach those same heights, but former Villa striker Emile Heskey believes there is still time for Sancho to prove his doubters wrong.",
      "“It's a tough time for the lad, but he’s only young. He’s only 25, so the reality is that he can get his career back on track, but he really needs to figure out what he wants from his career,” Heskey told 10bet Casino, as reported by Birmingham Live. “He needs to start knuckling down and playing regular, consistent football.",
      "“We’ve seen little glimpses of it, but we aren’t seeing enough of it. Unless you play regularly, it’s hard to get that fitness up to where it needs to be.",
      "“Jadon needs to get sharper and work hard, because technically he’s as good as anyone. He’s probably technically better than all the other Villa players, but everyone else is ahead of him because they are delivering on the pitch while he isn’t.",
      "“That’s sad to see, given the heights he was at. He was flying at Dortmund, moved to United, was in the England team. Really at the top of the game, with the best platform. Now he’s down here, but the fascinating thing is he can still build himself back up.",
      "“For example, I went from Liverpool, then four years without England football, I knew I could build myself back up. I knew I could get back in, and he can do that too. I played at the World Cup, and he’s at a similar age to do the same.”",
      "Sancho's contract at United is set to expire at the end of this season but the Red Devils have the option to extend his deal for a further year. The winger has made five appearances in all competitions for Villa so far this term, including two starts.",
      "Jason Wilcox has indicated the type of players Manchester United will target in future transfer windows. Wilcox, who was named the club’s director of football in June, gave his verdict on United's summer business, which included a trio of forwards and new goalkeeper Senne Lammens, and believes the Red Devils can continue to improve by recruiting with the right mentality to succeed at Old Trafford.",
      "“We have got a clear plan. We know what we have got to do, we know the areas of the team that we have got to improve,” Wilcox told MUTV. \"For us to get in the top four and consistently challenge for Champions League places, win Champions League, win Premier League, we have got to invest in the squad. We have got to buy the right players.",
      "“The right players who are talented but also who can deal with the pressure, who can take the squad forward. It is not always about just signing elite talent, they have got to have the right character and be somebody who can bring something different to the team. We are really happy with where we are.",
      "\"We know we have got to improve and, you know, the players, they will never be satisfied, Ruben will never be happy, I will never be happy, it is just how we are built. We are always looking to improve. Anybody who works at Manchester United should be thinking the same and they do, with the standards we are driving every day.”",

      "And ex-United forward Saha has seen enough to believe that Amorim could put together a title challenge at Old Trafford. Speaking to Covers.com, the Frenchman said: \"Why not?",

      "The Red Devils’ current situation is a remarkable contrast to earlier in the season where Amorim’s position was being called into serious question. And Saha is confident that United can extend that form this weekend against Nottingham Forest",
      "\"It's amazing,” he added. “Like I've been saying, the club, the players, they need time because we know the history behind them. It's not easy for anyone to just arrive and continue that story.",

      "“Now we are in a good environment, a good mode. We've won three games, and I believe the next game will be the fourth victory.",

He hinted that the job could be enticing and the scenario might eventually become a reality.",

That turnaround comes after comments from Dyche earlier this year, in which he claimed that he would 'win more games' at Old Trafford by reverting back to basics.",
      "While Amorim recognised that, he seemed wedded to his more comlex philosophy. But ahead of the pair’s meet-up this weekend, Dyche has suggested that the United manager has actually followed his advice.",

      "“The basics may have worked better was my suggestion and they have changed their style, so fair play to him. They are playing quicker forward and longer, a bit tighter in getting back into their shape. That's management, that's coaching.\"",

      "“We’ve got to be aware of that, but equally – if you look at our performance against Porto – that was a performance that we think would win against a lot of teams.",

      "Manchester United loanee Andre Onana's form since moving to Trabzonspor in September has been described as \"outstanding\".",
      "Onana was allowed to leave Old Trafford in the summer after Senne Lammens arrived at Old Trafford. After defeat to Fenerbahce on his Trabzonspor debut, Onana has not lost since.",
      "His side are currently on a four-game winning run which has lifted them to second in the table ahead of Saturday's trip to league leaders Galatasaray. Ahead of that match, MEN Sport spoke to Trabzonspor sports reporter Hasan Tuncel to discuss Onana's time at the Turkish club so far.",
      "\"In one word: outstanding,\" Tuncel said when asked how Onana had fared in his early months at the club. \"Onana’s debut came in the match against Fenerbahce. Trabzonspor lost 1–0, but the story of that game was far deeper than the scoreline.",
      "\"A Trabzonspor goal was controversially disallowed, creating real tension on the pitch. During that chaos, Onana’s leadership stood out - he calmed his teammates, used his experience, and pulled off some remarkable saves.",
      "\"From that moment on, not just the fans in Turkey but everyone watching internationally saw that he is still a top-level goalkeeper. He has maintained the same standard in the following matches.",
      "\"His performance against Kayserispor was phenomenal - he practically saved every shot on target. In the match against Eyupspor, his two crucial saves were instrumental in keeping Trabzonspor’s title hopes alive.",
      "\"So far, he’s been flawless. Beyond his goalkeeping, he’s become a leader in the dressing room.",
      "\"He personally mentors three young goalkeepers — Onuralp Cevikkan, Ahmet Dogan Yildirim, and Erolcan Colak — guiding them during and after training sessions. This mentorship has earned him great respect within the club.\"",
      "Tuncel admitted the reaction to Onana's arrival within the Trabzonspor fanbase was one of caution. Onana represented a significant investment for the club and his woes at United had been well-documented in Turkey.",
      "However, the welcome he received upon his arrival was on a different scale to high-profile signings of the past. \"In Trabzonspor’s culture, big-name signings are usually welcomed with great passion - but Onana’s arrival was something beyond the usual,\" he explained.",
      "\"We’ve seen large crowds at the airport before for players like Daniel Sturridge or John Obi Mikel, yet Onana’s reception had a different atmosphere. Because he arrived with his family, the club decided to organize a more personalized and emotional welcome.",
      "\"Fans interacted with him directly, telling him: 'Don’t worry, we’re with you all the way.' That moment, combined with Onana’s smile, created a very symbolic image.",
      "\"Players who come with their families usually adapt much faster - and that’s a crucial factor in professional football. Onana taking this process seriously and settling in with his family was seen as a very positive sign by both the club and its supporters.\"",
      "There is a sense that Onana has found the right environment to thrive but the chances of him signing permanently look to be slim. \"The club is extremely happy with his performances, but given the transfer fee Manchester United paid for him, a permanent deal looks financially difficult at the moment,\" Tuncel admitted.",
      "\"However, if Onana continues at this level and United lower their asking price, I have no doubt Trabzonspor would be interested in making a formal move.",
      "\"For now, the focus is on having Onana mentor the club’s young goalkeepers and help them grow. But if conditions become favourable, Trabzonspor would definitely love to keep him permanently.\"",

      "United fans chanted 'are you Schmeichel in disguise?' at Lammens on his debut. \"I don't listen to it too much during the game, but I saw it afterwards,\" he said about the chant.",
      "\"I'm not Schmeichel in disguise. I am just Senne Lammens trying to help the team. It is an amazing compliment to get, but you have to be realistic. He is one of the best goalkeepers ever. I have to prove a lot more to be in the same conversation as him. I want to have a long career here.",
      "\"Then, maybe in the end, I can be in the conversation with people like Schmeichel and [Edwin] Van der Sar and [David] De Gea. That would be really nice.\"",
      "Lammens added on his start at United: \"Of course, you hear from other people there is a lot of pressure coming here and playing for this team. But I welcome that. Firstly, it is nice you can play for such a big team. There should be a lot of pressure. I'm not really scared of it.",
      "\"There has been a lot of talk about tactics but it is not about that. It is about the way we play and the intensity. It is also about being realistic and knowing, against Liverpool, it won't be the prettiest game in terms of build-up. It was more about being direct and playing for the second balls.",
      "\"If we are high up the pitch, with the players we have, we can always make it difficult for the opponent. It is also not making it too difficult for ourselves. Building from the back can sometimes hurt you more than it helps.",
      "\"I have been trying not to take too many risks and trusting the qualities of the guys up front and in midfield. Sometimes we need to get the ball there as fast as possible.\"",
      "Lammens also discussed his relationship with United's defenders, revealing that Harry Maguire and Matthijs de Ligt had told him what they expected to see from him. \"They told me I don't need to be the most amazing or special goalkeeper, just to be there in important moments to give the team trust,\" he said.",
      "\"It makes them more relaxed knowing someone is behind them who can help them. One of the key points of a goalkeeper is helping the defence with communication.",
      "\"I am proud of being calm and collected. But when the time is needed, I can be harsh or shout at teammates. To have both characteristics is good.\"",

      "Paul Scholes has emotionally thanked his social media followers for the messages they have sent him after speaking out about caring for his 20-year-old son Aiden.",
      "Scholes openly discussed his son's autism earlier this week on episode 100 of the \"Stick to Football\" podcast alongside former Manchester United team-mates Gary Neville and Roy Keane.",
      "And taking to Instagram on Friday, Scholes shared on his story: \"Would just like to thank everyone for all your kind messages since the Overlap interview regarding Aiden.",
      "\"There have been loads and tried to read as many as possible. The response from families (especially Dads) shows how much speaking about it helps so many...",
      "\"There was one quote from a parent in a similar position that's just got me... 'my job is to stay alive for one day longer than my son/daughter'. Anyway, it's the weekend, let's have a few drinks and watch the football. Come on, Salford.\"",
      "\"Obviously, due to his special needs, you might know about, all the work I do now is just around his routines. 'cos he has quite a strict routine every single day, so I just decided everything I'm going to do is around Aiden.\"",
      "Scholes further explained: \"Everything I'm going to do now just works around him. I do studio work, but everything is built around his day.",
      "\"Last season on Thursday nights, I'd do the Europa League for Man United, that's the night I'd usually have him, so he was getting all agitated, biting and scratching. He knows the pattern's not there straight away.",
      "\"And I did that for years, really, always thinking I've got to stop this at some point, so I had the chance to do the podcast (The Good, The Bad & The Football), and I thought that would suit me more - well, not me, Aiden.\"",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "Scholes also spoke about his weekly arrangements after splitting up with Aiden's mother and his wife of 26 years. \"I'm not with Claire anymore, so we have him three nights each, and Claire's mum has him on a Friday night.",
      "\"We always do the same things with him, as he doesn't know what day or time of the week it is. But he'll know from what we're doing what day it is.",
      "\"I pick him up every Tuesday from his day care, and we go swimming. Loves swimming, then we get his pizza on the way home.",
      "\"Thursday, pick him up, go for something to eat, and go home. Sunday, I pick him up from Claire's house, and we go to Tesco, where he buys a trolley full of chocolate.",
      "\"So, he doesn't know what day or time it is, but he knows from what we're doing what day it is. He'll be 21 in December.\"",
      "This week’s Stick to Football podcast with Paul Scholes is available now on YouTube and all leading podcast platforms.",

      "Hello and welcome to our live Manchester United transfer blog on Friday, October 31.",
      "The January transfer window is now just two months away, and United are preparing for another busy period. While business is often challenging to conduct in the winter window, Ruben Amorim's men have been linked with a host of players.",
      "United are in red-hot form at the moment after claiming their third win in a row against Brighton last weekend. After beating Sunderland and Liverpool, the Reds will be hoping to maintain their form against Nottingham Forest tomorrow afternoon.",
      "As well as all the build-up to that game, we will bring you the latest transfer talk from Old Trafford. A new midfielder continues to be heavily linked with a move, alongside Angelo Stiller, Carlos Baleba, and Morten Hjulmand.",
      "This week, new links to West Ham United's Lucas Paqueta and Lille's Ayyoub Bouaddi have also emerged. The possible signing of a new operator in Amorim's midfield could spell the end of Kobbie Mainoo's time at the club, for the rest of the season at least, with Napoli preparing a move.",
      "Stay tuned below to stay up to date with the latest transfer news and build-up to the Nottingham Forest game...",
      "Speaking on talkSPORT, Steve Bruce compared Ruben Amorim to Mikel Arteta. The former United defender said: \"He’s had a great few weeks, they’ve won five out of the last seven.",
      "\"So there’s certainly been an upturn in their performances,\" added Bruce. \"I have to say, he’s made a big call in the dressing room to get rid of big players, with big reputations.",
      "\"It reminds me a little bit of Arsenal, what Arteta did a few years ago where he cleared out the dressing room where people are looking from afar thinking ‘wow, that’s a big call’. So he’s made some big managerial calls.\"",
      "In a recent interview with United’s in-house media channels, Jason Wilcox outlined United's long-term vision. The director of football at Old Trafford said: \"We have got a clear plan.",
      "\"We know what we have got to do, we know the areas of the team that we have got to improve. For us to get in the top four and consistently challenge for Champions League places, win Champions Leagues, win Premier Leagues, we have got to invest in the squad.",
      "\"We have got to buy the right players. The right players who are talented, but also who can deal with the pressure, who can take the squad forward...\"",
      "According to GiveMeSport, United are seriously considering rejecting proposals for Joshua Zirkzee in the January transfer window, with Bryan Mbeumo set to play for Cameroon at the Africa Cup of Nations.",
      "The report claims that the Reds could block the Dutchman's attempts to leave, despite having attracted interest from across Europe. It's said that Ruben Amorim, who will have limited attacking options, wants to keep Zirkzee.",
      "According to Defensa Central, Chelsea and United are keen on signing Kerim Alajbegovic from RB Salzburg. The report claims that the 18-year-old winger has attracted interest from some top clubs with his impressive performances in the Austrian top-flight.",
      "It's said that Real Madrid have also been keeping tabs on Alajbegovic, who has scored seven goals so far this season.",
      "\"Onana’s debut came in the match against Fenerbahce. Trabzonspor lost 1–0, but the story of that game was far deeper than the scoreline. A Trabzonspor goal was controversially disallowed, creating real tension on the pitch.",
      "\"During that chaos, Onana’s leadership stood out - he calmed his teammates, used his experience, and pulled off some remarkable saves.",
      "\"From that moment on, not just the fans in Turkey but everyone watching internationally saw that he is still a top-level goalkeeper...\"",
      "According to TeamTalk, West Ham have joined the race to sign Joshua Zirkzee ahead of the January transfer window. The United striker has struggled to force himself into Ruben Amorim's plans, and he faces an uncertain future at Old Trafford.",
      "The report claims AC Milan are also interested in securing Zirkzee's signature. It's said that Brighton, Aston Villa, and Everton have all registered interest in the Dutchman, while Sunderland are eyeing a potential loan deal.",
      "According to The Daily Briefing, United have held internal talks about Ayyoub Bouaddi. The 18-year-old midfielder has caught the eye for Lille in the French top-flight this season.",
      "The report claims that United have 'extensively' scouted Bouaddi, Christopher Vivell said to be a big fan. It's said that there's a long list of top European clubs, including Arsenal, keeping tabs on the teenager.",
      "Speaking on talkSPORT, Troy Deeney claimed Real Madrid could try to sign Antoine Semenyo if he continues to impress at Bournemouth. According to the Metro, United, Liverpool and Tottenham Hotspur are interested in signing the forward.",
      "The former Premier League striker said: \"I just don’t know if Semenyo can keep it up – do you know what I mean? If he does, then my God – he’ll probably end up playing for Real Madrid.",
      "\"I think he’s very good, very powerful, very direct. I just don’t know whether he’ll keep it up.\"",
      "In a column for GiveMeSport, Fabrizio Romano has reported that Angelo Stiller has attracted interest from Bundesliga clubs ahead of the January transfer window, but Stuttgart are yet to receive an offers.",
      "The report claims that Jason Wilcox has been monitoring the midfielder's progress for a while now as Ruben Amorim looks to bolster his options. It's said that a bid in region of £53m could be enough to sign Stiller.",
      "According to TBR Football, one of United's most lucrative contracts, a shirt sleeve sponsorship deal with DXC Technology, expires at the end of the season. The report claims that the club and the American IT and consultancy firm are now considering their options.",
      "United struck a deal with DXC Technology ahead of the 2022/23 campaign, reportedly worth £20m a season. When the partnership was announced, it was described as a 'multi-year' arrangement, and it remains to be seen whether or not it will be renewed.",
      "Red Bull Salzburg wonderkid Kerim Alajbegovic is wanted by Manchester United but Ruben Amorim's men face competition from Real Madrid and Chelsea.",
      "Defensa Central have claimed that Madrid are ready to rival the two Premier League teams to sign the prospect. Alajbegovic, a Bosnian international, has scored six goals for Salzburg this season and is attracting interest.",
      "Man United are in a three-horse race with Manchester City and Arsenal to sign Levante's Karl Etta Eyong.",
      "The striker has scored six goals and registered three assists from 10 mathces this season and Mundo Deportivo have claimed that the three Premier League teams are battling with Barcelona and Real Madrid to sign the 22-year-old.",
      "Barcelona see Eyong as a replacement for Robert Lewandowski. Eyong's contract includes a €30m release clause for La Liga teams and €40m for Premier League teams.",
      "Man United are keeping tabs on Juvents star Kenan Yildiz, but face an uphill battle in beating Chelsea to his signing.",
      "Team Talk have claimed that the Blues have held discreet talks with Yildiz's representatives and have submitted a \"very exciting proposal\" to bring him to Stamford Bridge.",
      "Yildiz is said to cost around €90million and United, alongside Liverpool, are also keen.",
      "Fabrizio Romano has reported that West Ham United have contacted Man United over a possible loan move about Joshua Zirkzee and Kobbie Mainoo.",
      "It comes after United were linked with Lucas Paqueta amid uncertainty over his future at the London Stadium. Both Zirkzee and Mainoo are both likely to be the subject of strong interest ahead of January.",
      "However, it's claimed Ruben Amorim does not want to allow either to depart.",
      "Reports in Spain have claimed that Man United are willing to offer Real Madrid Kobbie Mainoo in order to bring Endrick to Old Trafford.",
      "Defensa Central have claimed that Los Blancos are keen on Mainoo, but would like to send the striker the other way. Endrick hasn't played for Madrid this season and is almost guaranteed to secure a loan move in January.",
      "And it's good news for Man United. Football365 have claimed that the Reds have 'taken the lead' in the race to sign Adam Wharton.",
      "United's interest in the Crystal Palace star is said to have 'shocked Real Madrid management' with them working on a deal worth £61.5m.",
      "Adding another attacking midfielder has been touted by Man Unitd with Football365 suggesting that an approach has been made to West Ham over a possible move for Lucas Paqueta.",
      "The report claims they have 'asked for more details' to determine a fee for the Brazilian. It comes after The Times confirmed Paqueta's decision to leave the relegation-threatened club in January.",
      "Paqueta, 28, is under contract until 2027.",
      "Napoli are preparing a new attempt to sign Kobbie Mainoo in the January transfer window.",
      "The Italian champions wanted to sign him in the summer but Ruben Amorim was keen on keeping the midfielder. Gazzetta dello Sport have now claimed that Napoli are exploring a loan proposal, either a straight loan or a loan with performance-related clauses.",
      "Man United are reportedly actively monitoring Lille superstar Ayyoub Bouaddi.",
      "GIVEMESPORT have claimed that United have kept tabs on the midfielder since 2023 with Christopher Vivell maintaining a close eye on him in recent months.",
      "Bouaddi's contract in France expires in 2027 and it's said a fee of £40m could be enough to get the deal over the line.",
      "Yesterday, it was revealed that Lisandro Martinez is back in training with his Man United teammates as he continues his rehabilitation from an ACL injury.",
      "The defender has been out since February. Forest comes too soon for him but there is a chance he's in the squad for the Tottenham clash next week.\"Licha is on the final straight,\" Amorim said.",
      "\"He is a soldier who works so hard. He is always in the gym working hard. He works hard both on and off the pitch. He is a machine that works so hard. He is one those players who love to work hard. It is a pleasure to have him here.",
      "\"He works so much. We arrived at 9am, it's now 4pm and he continues working. He has the experience to know when to work hard. I am so glad - not just me, everyone - because he is an essential player at the club.\"",
      "AC Milan are reportedly keen on signing Joshua Zirkzee in January in a plan to replace Santiago Gimenez.",
      "Goal have claimed that the Dutchman is their main target for the transfer window with CEO Giorgio Furlani and sporting director Igli Tare scouting alternatives.",
      "Ruben Amorim has admitted that his side will struggle without Bryan Mbeumo and Amad when they go to the African Cup of Nations.",
      "\"We will have time to suffer,\" Amorim laughed. \"We are going to struggle a little bit, but we already knew it's going to be an opportunity. When I watch the training, there are players that should be playing.",
      "\"But it's hard with one game to take some players from the team, because they are doing well also during the training in games. So other players are going to have the opportunity to help us.",
      "\"They are understanding the way we want to play, so if we are improving on that, the change of characteristics is not going to change the idea or the momentum of the team. But let's use Amad and Bryan in these games and we will see in general.\"",
      "Man United are not currently pursuing AIK's young striker Kevin Filling.",
      "United's academy is essentially limited to a UK-based recruitment search due to Brexit rules.",
      "Filling is 16 years old, which means he could not join United in January, as reports have suggested.",
      "Read the full story here.",
      "Hello and good morning, Manchester United fans!",
      "Off-the-pitch, transfer business is heating up. Stay tuned and we'll bring you all the latest news..."

      "Manchester United are looking to win four games in a row for the first time since February 2024 when they travel to Nottingham Forest this afternoon.",
      "The Reds head into the game sixth in the table. Forest are in the relegation places and come into this game following a 2-0 defeat at Bournemouth last week.",
      "Ruben Amorim confirmed in his pre-match press conference that Lisandro Martinez is the only player certain to miss the game. However, he is back in training after an ACL injury. Harry Maguire remains a doubt having missed the clash with Brighton.",
      "Here's how our United writers think United should line up against Forest:",
      "Steven Railston",
      "There is no need to change the starting line-up after last weekend's win against Brighton. Amorim should make no changes and continue with the players who were responsible for that 4-2 victory at Old Trafford.",
      "Casemiro has become an important player again and should start alongside Bruno Fernandes in the centre of midfield. Amad is developing an excellent understanding with Bryan Mbeumo down the right.",
      "Benjamin Sesko came close to scoring against Brighton and should have chances to find the net against a struggling Forest side.",
      "Jack Flintham",
      "Amorim said before the Liverpool game that he did not pick Sesko as Virgil van Dijk and Ibrahima Konate enjoy the aerial battle. Forest's centre-back pairing of Murillo and Nikola Milenkovic will be very similar so there's no harm in adopting the striker-less tactic again.",
      "Mount is fit again and while Sesko did well at home to Brighton, he is the obvious player to drop out.",
      "Doubts surrounding Maguire's fitness mean Leny Yoro should be guaranteed a start again this weekend. A nervy moment up against Yankuba Minteh aside, he had a good game against Brighton so deserves to keep his place.",

      "Mainoo has not started in the Premier League this season. The midfielder has been limited to substitute appearances and his only start came against Grimsby Town in the Carabao Cup second round.",
      "Amorim was asked whether Champions League qualification was the target after a brilliant October and name-dropped Mainoo when discussing the importance of returning to Europe.",
      "\"No, it's not,\" Amorim said about Champions League qualification being the target. \"We need to go to Europe, because of everything. Our club needs to be in Europe.",
      "\"It's hard to have a very, very good scout. Imagine what it's like for me to have Kobbie Mainoo with the minutes that he's playing, he needs more games for me to make a rotation.",
      "\"Because with one game it's really hard, I have to take one of the guys that is playing to put another. When you have more games, you can divide, you can manage the group in a different way.",

      "\"We have to go to Europe. To be in the top four is really hard for our moment, but we never know, we just need to focus on winning the next one and then we will see.\"",
      "Amorim was asked about keeping the players who aren't playing happy and said: \"Because around the training ground, the mood seems so much brighter than it was.",
      "\"First of all, they understand, I prove that anyone can play, and everyone has to do the same things, not in the same way, but there are some things that everyone, no matter what is your name, you have to do it to play for Manchester United.",

      "Ruben Amorim wants Luke Shaw to play himself back into the England squad, but he would not mind if the defender was overlooked if it means he stays fully fit for Manchester United.",
      "Shaw has started every Premier League game this season and has remained injury-free.",
      "The 30-year-old seemed to pick up a knock against Brighton, but Amorim later confirmed he was substituted during the second half because he had been suffering from a virus in the days leading up to the game.",
      "Shaw struggled against Manchester City in the Manchester derby, but his performances have otherwise been strong and he could earn a recall to the England squad later this month.",
      "Gareth Southgate included Shaw in his England squad for Euro 2024. The defender has not received a call-up since that tournament, but his form could be rewarded by Thomas Tuchel.",
      "Amorim spoke at his pre-match press conference on Thursday and was asked whether he believed Shaw deserved a recall to England's squad. \"It's hard, it's hard here, it's hard in Portugal,\" he said.",
      "\"I have the same questions about the players, it's really hard to choose the players. People point a finger at you if you are the national manager, if you choose this one or the other one.",
      "\"And England has a lot of good players, and you can choose two teams to win a World Cup, I know it's tough for you guys, it's harder than Portugal, but it's an opinion.\"",
      "Amorim sympathised with the international selection process, adding: \"It's the way you play, it's the way you see the opponents you have. In the next two games, it will change what kind of player you want to call up. So I think he deserves it, but also a lot of players deserve to be back.",
      "\"For me, I want him to go to the national team, but I also want Luke Shaw to train with me, recover with me, and be prepared for my game, so I'm a little bit selfish on that, so if he's not going to the national team, for me it's fine, because I can control better what he's doing.\"",
      "Tuchel explained his decision to overlook Shaw during the October international break, saying: “It was a very close call. I just want him to have a little bit more minutes. He looks very fit.",
      "\"He looks very determined. I think he has the quality, the experience to play and to make us better straight away. But I want to keep him back a little bit, when he has more rhythm than he has right now.\"",

      "Victories against Sunderland, Liverpool and Brighton have lifted spirits in the dressing room and up next is a tough trip to the City Ground to face Nottingham Forest. The East Midlands side lost their first league game under new manager Sean Dyche - a 2-0 defeat at high-flying Bournemouth last weekend.",
      "United are showing shown signs of progress under Ruben Amorim, recording three straight wins - their first since between May to August 2024. The feel-good factor has returned to Old Trafford as they sit sixth in the table.",
      "However, Heskey believes the next step for United is securing a top-eight finish in the Premier League. Speaking about their recent resurgence, Heskey told Dream Vegas: \"He [Amorim] adapted to the way he needed to play against Liverpool, so it looks like he’s understanding a bit more the squad and understanding a bit more the players and understanding a bit more the league as well.",
      "\"I do believe that they see something in him that they believe is long-term, so I don’t see them sacking him. The next step is probably top eight, and then just keep putting their foot on the pedal and moving up the table to where they believe a club of the stature of Manchester United should be.",
      "\"They should be challenging in the top four eventually, but at this moment, they’re miles off that. The next step top eight and then get top six. I think that’s a successful season for me.\"",
      "Amorim has faced scrutiny for much of his tenure at Old Trafford, but three crucial wins seem to have eased concerns about his position, at least for now.",
      "\"It was a journey, a big journey,\" said Amorim when reflecting on his first year in charge. \"It was tough, really tough, good moments and bad moments.",
      "\"I learned a lot that is really important. I found out that even in my lower moments I can stick with the things I believe and that is a good thing for anyone to understand. Today the answer is different from three weeks ago.",
      "\"One of the biggest honours of my life to be here and I want to continue here for many years.\"",
      "United's visit to Forest will mark a year since Amorim took charge, succeeding Erik ten Hag as manager.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Former Manchester United assistant manager Rene Meulensteen believes that Ruben Amorim's side are in the title race. United sit six points off league leaders Arsenal and are enjoying their best run under the Portuguese tactician after three successive wins.",
      "They sit sixth in the table behind neighbours Manchester City and Tottenham Hotspur, as well as surprise packages in Bournemouth and Sunderland. Fortunes at Old Trafford have been far from fruitful after enduring some of their worst performances in their history in the top-flight.",
      "Meulensteen believes the new signings are beginning to come into their own and without the added stress of midweek European football, the Dutchman feels that this season will be the one they can fight back in England's top-flight.",
      "“When I first said that, I'm 100 per cent sure people were scratching their heads and asking what is he talking about? But the reason why I was saying it, and I still back it now, is that if you look at it United are only six points behind Arsenal,\" he said, speaking to compare.bet.",
      "\"Yes, people sometimes get blindsided by how poor of a start United had but they are starting to gain momentum.",
      "“I can see them also beating Forest and Spurs and suddenly that's five games in a row and they start to look stronger and stronger because Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo are settling in. Sesko is going to get his minutes on the clock. They're finding their way bit by bit and that confidence will grow.",
      "“They've got no midweek games, no midweek stress. They don't have to do a lot of squad rotation.",
      "\"They will grow and grow and grow. I’m telling you, Manchester United could be a surprise package who find themselves in second place soon and suddenly people will be saying what’s going on here and a completely different level of belief kicks in.",
      "\"Not only for the players but the manager as well, and the fans, and Manchester United are this force to be reckoned with again that everybody is looking at slightly differently.\"",
      "United return to Premier League action on Saturday as they take on Sean Dyche's Nottingham Forest. They can make it four wins in as many matches and reaffirm their status as Champions League contenders. Despite sitting sixth, Meulensteen claims they are in a good position to kick on and continue as dark horses.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "He added: “They might not say it themselves, and they might not believe it yet, but I honestly think they can do it. I’ve been one of the biggest critics for the reasons why they haven’t kicked on because of Amorim’s stubbornness with the system but if they do go on a run and everything clicks then you have to hold your hands up and say Amorim, listen, fantastic job. You stuck to your system and it’s working.",
      "“Has it got longevity? I still have my doubts. However in sport it can come down to factors you can’t quite put your finger on. Form, flow, karma. Look what's happening to Liverpool. Last year, nobody would have seen what has happened now. It was just easy sailing. Now they're in the worst storm they could have ever imagined and maybe don't know how to get out.",
      "“United have had these bad spells and suddenly, for whatever reason, something is starting to fall into place and people gain form and the negatives are turned into positives. That’s the role United can play this season, and it wouldn’t surprise me to see them in contention for the title. I would love to see them emerge from this dark horse position because nobody gave them a dime to do anything this season.",
      "“It would be a great position to be in unless suddenly something bad happens and they fall back into a run of not performing and winning. The three wins haven't cemented the base that we all would love to see just yet.",
      "“Do not underestimate the time that Amorim will now have to work with the players and work on the plan for the next opponent rather than managing a two day turnover between games in Europe and in the league. He will now have five to six days turnover. Sometimes seven.",
      "“With that time you can work, you can let the players relax a little bit. They can come back fresh, mentally fresh, not tired by travelling. I know all these things add up. It has an impact.”",

      "Manchester United minority shareholder Sir Jim Ratcliffe was reportedly left underwhelmed by the list of candidates to replace Erik ten Hag. Ruben Amorim is approaching the anniversary of his appointment at Old Trafford and nearly exactly 12 months on, he is finally enjoying his best period as the club's head coach.",
      "The appointment from Sporting CP was made with Dan Ashworth, Omar Berrada and Jason Wilcox in the hierarchy but Ashworth, the former Newcastle United chief, left the club abruptly shortly after Amorim's arrival. Despite facing pressure at points last season and during the current campaign, the Portuguese tactician has come through the tough times to steer United to three consecutive wins and on the edge of the top four.",
      "It could have been a different story however, according to The Guardian, a Premier League shortlist was drawn up which featured Eddie Howe, Graham Potter and Thomas Frank. The report adds that suggestions over Gareth Southgate's prospects to become the man at the Old Trafford helm were played down by United sources.",
      "The former England manager was also linked as a potential replacement for Amorim recently. As was Newcastle boss Howe.",
      "It has been said that Ratcliffe felt that the list was \"uninspiring\" as he looked to Ashworth to provide a conclusive list of successors. However, the article suggests that the failure of Ten Hag and the search for his replacement triggered a realisation from the United's chief that Ashworth wasn't the man he wanted to lead the club forward.",
      "The former Newcastle sporting director was said to have suggested not to make a risky appointment and pitched a list of Premier League candidates before United opted for Amorim. After defeat in the Europa League and a poor start in the Premier League, as well as the shock Carabao Cup defeat to Grimsby Town, pressure ramped up on the 40-year-old's future.",
      "However there has been an upturn in form and it comes a matter of weeks after Ratcliffe spoke publicly to defend Amorim and rubbish the suggestion he could be on the managerial chopping block. “He has not had the best of seasons,” he told The Business podcast.",
      "\"Ruben needs to demonstrate he is a great coach over three years. That’s where I would be. The press, sometimes I don’t understand. They want overnight success.",
      "\"They think it’s a light switch. You know, you flick a switch and it’s all going to be roses tomorrow.",
      "\"You can’t run a club like Manchester United on kneejerk reactions to some journalist who goes off on one every week.”",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "It's funny what can happen in just 12 months in football - you only need to ask Casemiro.",
      "Casemiro was hooked at half-time against Liverpool at the beginning of September 2024 and replaced by Toby Collyer, which felt like the beginning of the end for the Brazilian.",
      "Erik ten Hag had stood by Casemiro after his horror show at Selhurst Park near the end of the previous season, but his patience had worn thin, resulting in the removal of the midfielder at the interval. \"It was tactical because we were 2-0 down,” said Ten Hag about his substitution.",
      "Collyer had usurped Casemiro in the pecking order, but he was loaned to West Brom in the summer, and the Brazilian has enjoyed a renaissance to become an important player again.",
      "After Brighton, Ruben Amorim said: \"I think he gives a lot of experience, he is an example for everyone. In the beginning, he was behind every midfielder, even Toby [Collyer].",
      "\"But he fought and worked and now he is back in the national team. He is so important to us. He ran a lot, today he had to fight and press, and then return. I'm really pleased with him.",
      "\"And the other guys need to look at Casemiro. To understand that football can change really fast. You just need to work for me. If I think you are the best one to play a game, then you will.\"",
      "United were leading 3-0 against Brighton last weekend when Casemiro was replaced in the 70th minute. Brighton scored two goals following the substitution to set up a nervy end to the game.",
      "United have only conceded three goals this season when Casemiro has been on the pitch. They have conceded 16 goals in all competitions and 13 have gone in when Casemiro has not been on the field.",
      "Casemiro has started every Premier League game except against Brentford due to a suspension. United lost that match 3-1 at the Gtech Community Stadium and Manuel Ugarte looked off the pace in midfield.",
      "Amorim has relied on Casemiro during this campaign. The player deserves credit for an unlikely resurgence, although his improvement can be traced back to Ruud van Nistelrooy's interim tenure last year.",
      "Van Nistelrooy immediately put an arm around Casemiro and leaned on his experience. He started Casemiro in each of his four games as interim manager and launched a passionate defence of his squad role after United's dominant 5-2 win against Leicester City in the Carabao Cup.",
      "Casemiro scored two brilliant goals in that game, and Van Nistelrooy said: \"I was delighted for Casemiro. The way he's been training and helping the team, the club, it's such an example.",
      "\"If you see him train and prepare for games, with the history and all he's achieved with five Champions Leagues, he's an example for us and that was part of my celebration - I was happy for him.\"",
      "Van Nistelrooy lifted Casemiro at a time when it seemed like everything was going against him. The Dutchman placed his trust in him and reminded him of what he was still capable of.",
      "Casemiro had to prove himself to Amorim following his appointment from Sporting Lisbon. By the end of January, Casemiro had started in four of Amorim's 18 games in charge.",
      "Amorim suggested Casemiro no longer had the \"characteristics\" to start regularly, but everything changed in the spring. Casemiro was instrumental in the Europa League campaign, better-suited to the pace of the competition, and he delivered a midfield clinic in the quarter-final comeback against Lyon.",
      "Casemiro won the penalty in the 114th minute against Lyon, he found Kobbie Mainoo for the equaliser and he assisted again with a wonderful cross into the box for Harry Maguire's winner.",
      "Amorim lept off his feet on the touchline and perhaps that performance was the turning point. Casemiro started alongside Bruno Fernandes in the Europa League final, with Ugarte named on the bench.",
      "Casemiro has forced his way back into Amorim's plans. He has showcased the character that propelled him to become the world's finest defensive midfielder during his nine-year stint at Real Madrid.",
      "Now, there is a conversation among supporters about extending his contract. Casemiro has entered the final year of his deal and the club has the option of extending by 12 months.",
      "Regardless of how well Casemiro has performed and his importance to the team, his contract should not be extended. United must take a long-term view and it's not logical to extend Casemiro's contract when he's in the winter of his career. This season should be his swansong.",
      "The fact that there is even a conversation among some fans about extending Casemiro's deal is a credit to him, but United must allow him to leave in the summer and sign a replacement.",
      "Casemiro will be 34 in February. How long he can keep up this level of performance is up for debate. Amorim will hope the kinder schedule will help him maintain his current performances.",
      "United must return to the Champions League and securing a top-four finish will be a fitting way for Casemiro to bow out.",

      "Manchester United loanee Andre Onana has insisted that he does not fear any opponent on the football pitch and would not define himself as a loser since moving to Trabzonspor on loan in September.",
      "Onana began the season as back-up to Altay Bayindir after suffering an injury during pre-season. The Cameroonian was given his chance to impress against Grimsby Town but a poor performance sealed his fate at Old Trafford.",
      "On deadline day, Senne Lammens joined United and after the window closed, the Reds took advantage of Turkey's extended market to allow Onana to leave on loan. The deal with Trabzonspor is a straight loan switch with no option to buy, but the goalkeeper has impressed his new club.",
      "He has not lost a game since his debut against Fenerbahce and has kept two clean sheets in his last three appearances. In an interview with Sporx this week, Onana spoke confidentally about his style of play and attitude towards being a goalkeeper.",
      "\"I never fear anyone. Because in this life, I only fear God,\" he explained.",
      "\"Therefore, to be honest, no one can scare me. For me, most of the time, the important thing is to try to do what's best for the team.",
      "\"If I need to play out from the back, I first analyse. Is the opponent pressing? Are they pressing with the winger, the striker, or are their centre-backs stepping up? These are the things I need to see when the ball is at my feet.",
      "\"I track how the opponent moves and look at the options before making my decision.\" United fans would argue that Onana did not distribute the ball as well as was expected during his time at the Theatre of Dreams, but the 29-year-old refuses to see that as a failure.",
      "\"Looking back, my career has really been amazing,\" he continued. \"There have been many ups and downs in this process, but that also meant a lot of learning moments, a lot of experiences.",
      "\"Coming from Cameroon and playing in Barcelona, Ajax, Inter, Manchester, and now in Trabzonspor is magnificent. Coming from there and looking at today, seeing what I've achieved in the last 10-11 years - amazing, really amazing.",
      "\"Every time I put on my boots or gloves, I want to win. Because at the end of the day, that's what we play for.",
      "\"We play to win, and I’m not afraid of anyone. When I step onto the pitch, I either win or I learn. I don’t see myself as a loser. If I don’t win, I take it as an opportunity to learn.",
      "\"Let me give you an example: my first match here was against Fenerbahce. We played well, but we didn’t win. But I don’t see it as a loss. I learned something, for instance, I learned how the referees are here.\"",
      "Onana's Trabzonspor now sit second in the Super Lig table and are just five points behind league leaders Galatasaray. Next up for them is a trip to the table-toppers on Saturday evening.",

      "He was initially given a yellow card before England was advised by VAR to review the incident on the pitch-side monitor. After a brief check, the decision was overturned and Dorgu was sent off.",
      "At the time, England was seen explaining the decision before brandishing the red card and former PGMOL chief and ex-FIFA referee Keith Hackett admitted that it opened the referee up to backlash.",
      "\"The red card issued by Darren England is correct, this is a challenge with excessive force, that endangers the safety of his opponent,\" he told Football Insider. \"Frankly, [when refereeing myself] I monitored the player leaving the field of play without engaging in any discussion, it is easy in the heat of the situation to be accused of saying something.",
      "\"You should monitor for sure, but there is no point of explaining why the player is being sent off, it is pretty obvious when you make a challenge with such force.”",

      "Amorim said before that game that he hoped to have Maguire back this week, but there was no sign of him in the footage released by the club. It may be that he was just not picked up by the cameras, but Amorim will hope he's available for the weekend.",

      "Manchester United winger Marcus Rashford is enjoying a career revival at Barcelona.",
      "When he left Aston Villa at the end of last season, Rashford's career was at a crossroads. Yes, his performances at the West Midlands club were improving, but he was still some way off his best, leading to questions over which Rashford we would see the following season.",
      "To Barcelona's credit, they took a gamble despite the warning signs. Now, it seems that gamble is paying off.",
      "Last week saw Rashford grab a brace and an assist in the 6-1 thrashing of Olympiacos. He followed that up with an assist in El Clasico and while Barcelona lost to Real Madrid, it was another milestone on Rashford's journey back to top form. Rashford now has five goals and seven assists for the Catalan club in 13 appearances.",
      "Plenty of United supporters will see Rashford's numbers and wonder whether there is a scenario whereby he returns to Old Trafford. Unfortunately for them, it feels like that is impossible and his recent comments confirm just that.",
      "Speaking before the clash with Real Madrid, Rashford told ESPN: \"It was so many years in one place. People forget this, but 24 years, 23 years of my life was with Manchester United. So sometimes you just need a change.",
      "\"I think maybe this is the case with me and yeah, I'm enjoying everything.\"",
      "Rashford is benefitting from a change of scenery, culture and team. It is not a case that the 27-year-old has suddenly been relieved of all pressure, because United and Barca are comparable on that front.",
      "But in England he was under the spotlight daily and, in a struggling side, he was expected to be the main man. Eyes aren't always on Rashford to be the key man in Barcelona.",
      "United and Rashford will always be linked but that chapter is now closed.",

      "Matthijs de Ligt urged his Manchester United teammates to cut out mistakes and take responsibility when he spoke after the disappointing Brentford defeat in September.",
      "United suffered a big setback at the Gtech Community Stadium. Ruben Amorim's future subsequently dominated headlines, but Amorim has enjoyed an October to remember.",
      "Amorim must be in contention to win manager of the month after impressive wins against Sunderland, Liverpool and Brighton, which have seen United climb up to sixth in the table.",
      "So what has been the difference? Amorim has made a few tweaks. Senne Lammens made his debut against Sunderland before the international break and the goalkeeper punted most of his goal kicks long.",
      "Benjamin Sesko was found regularly by Lammens and speaking after the victory, Mason Mount said about the goalkeeper's impressive impact: \"It was a solid performance. Any danger of them pressing, he puts it into Ben [Sesko] and we work off that. I think he kind of released the pressure a lot.\"",
      "Amorim hinted that supporters could see the same against Liverpool. \"I think if you look at nowadays, every time the ball goes to the goalkeeper, most of the teams play man-to-man,\" he said.",
      "\"Sometimes you don't have anyone to play and you try to use the first ball with the second ball and try to win. When you have players with a lot of power in front and now we have it. If we win one second ball, we can take all that build-up from the game and have the opportunity to score.",
      "\"I think everyone is doing that. Senne has one ability that is really good. He can play with both feet. It's harder for the opponents to try to make the pressure from one side or the other.",
      "\"They know that he can kick the ball with both feet and I think that is really important. But he also needs to be ready. People are seeing the games. Understanding that it takes a little bit of time to choose.",
      "\"He needs to be ready for the Premier League. It's something that you use if it's man-to-man in front. You are not building up. You can put the ball in one against one up front and that is the play.\"",
      "Arne Slot complained about United's effective approach, but Amorim refused to respond to the comments from the Liverpool manager. \"Liverpool is in the past, I don’t want to comment,\" he said last Friday.",
      "\"It is not important, it is important what Fabian [Hurzeler] said - to try to understand what is going to happen [against Brighton]. I understand everything, I am really pleased that the team can play different games.",
      "\"It was an important win but I was the first one to say we need to play better with the ball. I don’t care what Slot is saying, what people are saying about our team.",
      "\"I can watch the game and say we can do better and we need to do better in the future but sometimes you need to adapt to the game. So I don’t need anyone to evaluate my team. I can evaluate my team and I am really clear that we should play better with the ball and we are going to try to do that in this game.\"",
      "United have gained confidence, helping the back-three to push up to squeeze the opponent more aggressively. \"That was the plan [defenders pressing with aggression],\" said Amorim after Brighton. \"When we have Harry Maguire we can defend better our box so we can play a little lower.",
      "\"But when you have players that can press high... Luke is not really tall, but he's fast and aggressive. We can press a little higher and we know if we win the ball we have players in front of the goal. They [United's attackers] are so good that we just need one chance when we win the ball.\"",
      "Amad has hit form after suffering from a family bereavement. The 23-year-old's understanding with Bryan Mbeumo has blossomed and the pair were crucial against Liverpool and Brighton.",
      "\"He's a working machine,\" said Amorim about Mbeumo. \"He's so good in transitions. He's improving when we are organising the final third. The connection with Amad is really hard to beat these two guys because they change positions. They are really fast, they are good in one against one.\"",
      "The pieces have fallen into place and United are now officially an in-form team.",

    "body": [
      "Casemiro made a beeline for Ruud van Nistelrooy in the Old Trafford tunnel on his return with Leicester City in February.",
      "Van Nistelrooy, a fluent Spanish speaker, was the conduit between Casemiro and Erik ten Hag after his Portuguese-speaking assistant Mitchell van der Gaag left. Van Nistelrooy started Casemiro in all four of his matches as caretaker manager. Casemiro lingered as Van Nistelrooy spoke, as attached to him as a comfort blanket.",
      "At that time, Casemiro had not started for United in 39 days. He did not get a kick between December 30, the night of the Newcastle United debacle, and January 30. He emerged on 70 minutes in Bucharest with United 2-0 up. The transfer window was still open but the chances of United shifting Casemiro were, like the Trinity test igniting the atmosphere, near zero.",
      "People at United's Carrington training complex noticed Casemiro's personality never wavered during a trying first half of the season. They have always found him to be a warm presence.",
      "His transformation at United in the past two months has been as unexpected as their 3-0 triumph in Bilbao. This is the midfielder who was dropped for last year's FA Cup final and replaced by Toby Collyer with United 2-0 down to Liverpool at half-time eight months ago. Casemiro’s declaration that he was keen to see out his contract in March was framed as more bad news for the club.",
      "Casemiro used his head before Athletic lost theirs in San Mames. Returning to Spain emboldens Casemiro. In San Sebastián and Bilbao, he has reminded Spanish audiences he can still cut it nearly three years on from leaving their shores. United supporters serenaded Casemiro on Thursday night.",
      "The draw with Real Sociedad in mid-March has marked a late turning point in Casemiro's third season in Manchester. With Manuel Ugarte out injured, Ruben Amorim had little choice but to turn to the older defensive midfielder.",
      "Casemiro has since been a fixture in the United starting XI, his importance highlighted by the early withdrawal at Bournemouth last week to preserve him for Bilbao. Ugarte admitted this week he is copying him.",
      "Within a matter of months, Casemiro has gone from unsellable to undroppable. If or when United reach the Europa League final, Casemiro is a shoo-in in midfield. The 3-4-2-1 system Amorim swears by has closed the yawning gaps that developed between the defence and midfield under Ten Hag and Casemiro has the safety net of a third centre back.",
      "United have adjusted Casemiro’s running and pressing triggers. “I think he has improved a lot also,” Amorim opined. “You can see not the way he plays but the way he runs. You can see it, we have the data to show him where he worked really hard.",
      "“He is a very good example. Even Toby sometimes was playing in front of him and [that] it is hard to take for Casemiro. So it is a lesson for all the players in Manchester United.",
      "“No matter what is the past or the last month, everything can change in one moment. Then we understood that he cannot jump all the time pressing high. We need to let him understand and sometimes it is better to put three defenders and let him be the fourth defender and put the wing-backs pressing high. These are all things we are understanding and trying to cope with all the criticisms of the team. But the credit is for Casemiro.”",
      "Amorim has been impressed by how hard Casemiro has worked to meet his demands to regain his place in the team. He noticed that he never complained during those winter weeks warming the bench.",
      "Selflessness is a natural trait of Casemiro's. It was also his undoing this time last year. With United depleted at centre half, he dropped back and was humiliated in the 4-0 drubbing by Crystal Palace.",
      "With Kobbie Mainoo and Christian Eriksen a flimsy shield and Jonny Evans his creaking partner, Casemiro abandoned his position to engage Michael Olise, overcommitted, lost his balance and Olise scored. Six days later, he trundled out of the United third and played Arsenal winger Gabriel Martinelli onside to square for Leandro Trossard’s tap-in. Sofyan Amrabat was ushered back in from the cold and played his way into the FA Cup final XI.",
      "Jamie Carragher urged Casemiro to “leave the football before the football leaves you”. Casemiro had been pencilled in to flank Amorim for pre-match press duties against Athletic and he would be a worthy choice at Carrington next week. He is a positive story again and one of the squad’s figureheads. United view Casemiro as a quiet leader, mind.",
      "The 33-year-old shared Raphael Varane’s view that a “disconnect” had developed between the players and Ten Hag. It is not a coincidence that Casemiro scored two goals in the first game after Ten Hag was finally sacked. He was committed enough to claim the last goal of the Ten Hag era at West Ham.",
      "When Casemiro discussed the possibility of joining United, he wanted to know three things: where he would live, where he would train and where the stadium was. During FaceTime conversations, he requested to see the club’s gymnasium at Carrington.",
      "United sources have been struck by how leaner Casemiro is this season. People in Madrid said Casemiro used to be in the club's Valdebebas gym at 8am and he often has gym sessions before and after training at Carrington.",
      "Casemiro has struck up a close rapport with some of the masseurs and his English is now a very good level of conversational. He understood our questions in the mixed zone two years ago, when his handshake grip was as tight as a vice. Casemiro's wife, Anna, and children Sara and Caio, are happy in Manchester amid the prospect of a fourth year in England's north west.",
      "Staff at Carrington regard Casemiro as one of the most respectful players they have encountered and that he is strident in protecting the club's image. Sir Jim Ratcliffe dubbed Casemiro as \"overpaid\" and \"not good enough\" in March. Three days later, Casemiro trumped his first-leg performance against Sociedad in the 4-1 win at Old Trafford.",
      "His steep decline over 18 months - dropped for Amrabat, substituted for Collyer, omitted from the Brazil squad - makes Casemiro’s revival so singular. If United win the Europa League it would be churlish to argue someone who has won three trophies in three seasons has been an unsuccessful signing.",
      "Casemiro drove United to a successful 2022-23 season. Without him, they would not have qualified for the Champions League. Ten Hag dubbed him the “cement between the stones”, essentially the glue in the team. Casemiro was central to the Latino rebranding of the United defence that kept the most clean sheets in the Premier League.",
      "Casemiro has returned to that level of influence he wielded in his first season. In Europe, at least. The concern if United do not triumph in Bilbao again this month is Casemiro could be redundant in a campaign devoid of Champions League midweeks. His recent domestic form has been inoffensive but not stellar and United need a young and dynamic new central midfielder in the summer.",
      "The senior figures made the difference in Bilbao, though. Casemiro and Bruno Fernandes, two 30-something Portuguese speakers, are naturally close.",
      "“We've got a lot of senior players who need to step up in their moments,” Harry Maguire explained. “I think Case was brilliant tonight. Bruno as well. So we have senior players who need to handle these moments really well.”",
      "Van Nistelrooy, a champion of Casemiro’s, merits credit for that.",

      "Man Utd have hit their stride in recent weeks as the pressure on head coach Ruben Amorim has eased after he looked on the brink of the sack at the start of this campaign.",

      "Summer signings Senne Lammens, Bryan Mbeumo, Matheus Cunha and Benjamin Sesko have made a positive impact in recent matches as the optimism at Man Utd has risen, with the Premier League giants sitting sixth in the table after nine matches.",

      "READ: Ornstein touts Mbappe to Arsenal with Man Utd told to sign £100m man",
      "“The system is the same, but they have done it a bit differently this season. They’ve been harder to beat, they’ve made more chances because they have better front players and they look a bit more organised.",
      "“His problem has been, in certain games, I think is playing the playing personnel in the wrong roles in that system which is a bit different.",
      "“But if they were to go and win, I’d say they’d have a great bit of momentum, good run, feel-good factor, and the pressure drops.",
      "“Then they have a realistic chance of top six, top seven, maybe even top four if they have an amazing run, but I don’t think so because they are heavily reliant on a couple of the front boys.”",
      "Murphy has also argued that Man Utd’s wing-backs need to do “more”, with the pundit pointing the finger at Amad Diallo, Patrick Dorgu and Diogo Dalot, who have had the most minutes on the flanks this season.",
      "“I still think they could get a bit more from their wing-backs,” Murphy added.",
      "“When I think of teams who have played that system and been really successful, wing-backs have done really well.",
      "“When Chelsea won the league playing that 3-4-3, they had Alonso and Moses both chipping in with goals and assists regularly.",

      "When asked how they could do more, Murphy continued: “Goals and assists. If you’re playing wing-back, you are getting in great areas, you really are. I’m not talking double figures but they need to chip in [with goals and assists].”",

      "According to reports, Manchester United have submitted an ‘offer’ as they look to sign a former Barcelona star, while they are also eyeing Vinicius Junior.",
      "In this summer’s transfer window, Man Utd did positive business as they have rebuilt after finishing 15th in the Premier League and failing to win a trophy in 2024/25.",
      "Club chiefs raised funds through player sales as they offloaded Marcus Rashford, Rasmus Hojlund, Antony, Alejandro Garnacho and Jadon Sancho.",
      "This enabled the Red Devils to spend around £230m to overhaul Ruben Amorim‘s attack by signing Benjamin Sesko, Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha, while they acquired Senne Lammens to replace Andre Onana as their No.1 goalkeeper.",
      "Each of these signings have made a positive impact as Man Utd have won three Premier League games in a row to move up to sixth in the table, though they are likely to be active in the next two transfer windows.",

      "It has been widely reported that their next priority will be to sign a No.6 after failing to sign Brighton star Carlos Baleba in the summer, with Crystal Palace’s Adam Wharton and Nottingham Forest’s Elliot Anderson also mooted as targets.",
      "However, a report from Spanish outlet Fichajes claims they are also keen for more attacking reinforcements, with it claimed that they have made an ‘offer’ worth 50 million euros (around £44m) for former Barcelona forward Vitor Roque.",
      "The 20-year-old joined Barcelona in 2023 and he only had a short spell with the Spanish giants as he reportedly had a fallout with club chiefs.",
      "Roque had a loan spell at Real Betis last season before returning to Brazil by joining Palmeiras in a record deal worth over £21m towards the start of this year.",
      "Roque has 17 goals in 47 appearances for Palmeiras and Fichajes are saying that he is on Man Utd’s ‘target list’.",
      "The report claims:",
      "‘Next summer’s transfer window could mark the decisive moment for Vitor Roque if Palmeiras decides not to retain him any longer. The figure of 50 million euros is mentioned as a starting point for negotiations.",
      "‘Palmeiras warns that it “will not let him go for less than his true value” and intends to benefit from his offensive explosion before a hypothetical departure.’",
      "Another report from Fichajes claims Man Utd are among the contenders to sign wantaway Real Madrid star Vinicius, who has reportedly had a fallout with head coach Xabi Alonso.",
      "It is claimed that the Red Devils are willing to ‘break their limits’ with a huge offer worth around 200 million euros (£175m) for Vinicius.",
      "The report explains:",
      "‘The arrival of Manchester United’s offer of €200 million, while still speculative, forces Real Madrid to make a decision: retain him during this period of transition or accept a figure that few clubs could match.",
      "‘Sources in the Spanish capital have stated that Vinícius is not for sale below his astronomical release clause, but have admitted that a €200 million offer could spark serious negotiations. This amount represents a sum that could force Real Madrid to rethink its attacking structure and transfer policy.’",
      "Wantaway Real Madrid star Vinicius Junior has reportedly already made a ‘firm decision’ on his preferred next move amid interest from the Premier League.",
      "Real Madrid superstar Vinicius Junior has issued a statement amid claims he could leave the Bernabeu with Man Utd and Chelsea linked.",

      "Man Utd? Liverpool? Arsenal? PSG? There’s just one option for Vinicius Junior, who says he wants to leave Real Madrid after his El Clasico hissy fit.",
      "Real Madrid are reportedly willing to sacrifice any player, except Kylian Mbappe, to land Juventus forward Kenan Yildiz. So, Vinicius Jr to Man Utd then?",
      "Real Madrid superstar Vinicius Junior reportedly ‘will be sold’ in the summer if he rejects a contract offer, with a £300million bid coming, per an insider."

      "Man Utd have had a great couple of weeks as they have won back-to-back Premier League games for the first time under Amorim by beating Sunderland and Liverpool before following that up with a victory over Brighton.",
      "Therefore, there has been an injection of optimism at Old Trafford, with their situation helped by summer signings Senne Lammens, Benjamin Sesko, Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha hitting the ground running.",

      "READ: Was October 2025 the greatest Man Utd month since Sir Alex Ferguson retired?",
      "In January, the Red Devils invested around £25m to sign Patrick Dorgu from Serie A side Lecce as he’s a natural wing-back that fits into Amorim’s preferred 3-4-3 formation.",
      "The 21-year-old has impressed in fits and starts over the past ten months, though he has dropped in the pecking order of late. He has come off the bench in Man Utd’s last three Premier League matches.",
      "Despite this, a new report from The Sun claims Amorim has given his full backing to Dorgu, who has been ‘told’ that he could become the ‘best left-back in the world’.",
      "This is said to be dependent on Dorgu learning from PSG standout Nuno Mendes, who previously worked with Amorim at Sporting Lisbon.",
      "The report also claims that Amorim is ‘obsessed’ with helping Dorgu reach his full potential, with it noted that three of the defender’s qualities are fuelling the head coach’s confidence.",
      "An ‘insider’ for The Sun said: ”Dorgu has had some ups and downs this season, but Amorim is fully behind him.",
      "“He believes Dorgu’s athleticism, skillset and mentality can make him United’s left back for the next ten years.",
      "“The goal is to make him more decisive in attack — more assists, more goals, more involvement in second balls — like what Amad gives them on the opposite flank.”",
      "They added: “They’ve even worked with him on covering the left side of central defence, the way Mendes sometimes does at PSG.",
      "“Amorim is obsessed with helping Dorgu reach that level as quickly as possible. He genuinely sees him as the next Nuno Mendes.”",
      "Does the combination of Ruben Amorim implausibly righting the Man Utd ship while Liverpool plunge into crisis make October 2025 the best post-Fergie month of all?",
      "We had three favourites in the Sack Race this weekend, and that is undeniably pure Barclays. Ruben Amorim is surely safe for now.",
      "In a career where you can fail upwards, we’ve taken our best guess at where every Premier League boss will be come 2030.",

And Senne Lammens has been something of a revelation after coming into the team in recent weeks as the new No.1 goalkeeper.",
      "All four signings would be classed as hits rather than misses at this early stage of their Old Trafford careers, and Wilcox is delighted with the way they’ve settled at the club.",
      "He said: “Yeah the guys have settled in really, really quickly. I think especially when you look at Matheus and Bryan, they have played in the Premier League and they have lived in England, so there is a quicker transition.",
      "“I think for Benji and Senne, you look at their transition and they have transitioned really well. We are really pleased. They are two young players, two for the future, but they have settled in amazingly well.",

      "When asked by our friends at Planet Football who he would sign if he was in Arteta shoes, Ornstein replied Mbappe.",

      "Andre Onana’s performances for Trabzonspor following his Manchester United exit have been summed up “in one word” as the chances of a permanent transfer have been revealed.",
      "Onana joined Man Utd from Inter Milan for £47m in the summer of 2023 but was allowed to leave the club in September after his less than convincing displays for the Red Devils last season.",
      "A four-game winning run has moved Trabzonspor into second place in the Turkish Super Lig and Onana hasn’t tasted defeat for his new club since his debut loss against Fenerbahce.",
      "And Trabzonspor correspondent Hasan Tuncel was full of praise for the 29-year-old when asked for his assessment of his performances, describing his contribution as “flawless”.",
      "“In one word: outstanding,” Tuncel said. “Onana’s debut came in the match against Fenerbahce. Trabzonspor lost 1–0, but the story of that game was far deeper than the scoreline.",
      "“A Trabzonspor goal was controversially disallowed, creating real tension on the pitch. During that chaos, Onana’s leadership stood out – he calmed his teammates, used his experience, and pulled off some remarkable saves.”",
      "“From that moment on, not just the fans in Turkey but everyone watching internationally saw that he is still a top-level goalkeeper. He has maintained the same standard in the following matches.",
      "“His performance against Kayserispor was phenomenal – he practically saved every shot on target. In the match against Eyupspor, his two crucial saves were instrumental in keeping Trabzonspor’s title hopes alive.",
      "“So far, he’s been flawless. Beyond his goalkeeping, he’s become a leader in the dressing room.",
      "“He personally mentors three young goalkeepers – Onuralp Cevikkan, Ahmet Dogan Yildirim, and Erolcan Colak – guiding them during and after training sessions. This mentorship has earned him great respect within the club.”",

      "On how Onana was welcomed to the club, Tuncel added: “In Trabzonspor’s culture, big-name signings are usually welcomed with great passion – but Onana’s arrival was something beyond the usual,” he revealed.",
      "“We’ve seen large crowds at the airport before for players like Daniel Sturridge or John Obi Mikel, yet Onana’s reception had a different atmosphere. Because he arrived with his family, the club decided to organize a more personalized and emotional welcome.",
      "“Fans interacted with him directly, telling him: ‘Don’t worry, we’re with you all the way.’ That moment, combined with Onana’s smile, created a very symbolic image.",
      "“Players who come with their families usually adapt much faster – and that’s a crucial factor in professional football. Onana taking this process seriously and settling in with his family was seen as a very positive sign by both the club and its supporters.”",
      "Despite Onana’s excellent form, it’s unlikely Trabzonspor will have the wherewithal to complete his permanent signing",
      "Tuncel continued: “The club is extremely happy with his performances, but given the transfer fee Manchester United paid for him, a permanent deal looks financially difficult at the moment,” Tuncel admitted.",
      "“However, if Onana continues at this level and United lower their asking price, I have no doubt Trabzonspor would be interested in making a formal move.",
      "“For now, the focus is on having Onana mentor the club’s young goalkeepers and aid their development. But if conditions become favourable, Trabzonspor would certainly love to keep him on a permanent basis.”",
      "Here is our ranking of every Premier League No.2 goalkeeper. Liverpool will need to call on theirs soon to make his English top-flight bow due to injury.",
      "Man Utd are ‘expected’ to place a £60m bid for Everton centre-back Jarrad Branthwaite in the January transfer window, according to reports.",
      "Manchester United have been “blamed” for one Red Devils star becoming a “sacrificial lamb” during his time at Old Trafford.",
      "Man Utd were given more indications over the weekend that they could be the problem as Marcus Rashford and Andre Onana shone out on loan.",
      "Ruben Amorim’s Manchester United squad was ‘relieved’ to see Andre Onana leave the club for one reason, according to a report.",
      "Andre Onana is the latest Erik ten Hag signing to leave under Man Utd head coach Ruben Amorim, with the goalkeeper joining Trabzonspor on loan."

      "“They first demonstrate sacrifice for the team, they run. Sometimes we can see them run too much and then they get tired in the middle of the second half, but that’s good because we know they will get their reward later in the season.",
      "“They will score goals, run less, and play more relaxed—that’s football. But so far, these three players add a lot of quality to the team and are helping a lot. They’ve been scoring goals, being very productive, and involved in every match. And that’s what we want for each player who comes to the club.”",

      "They’ve won a few trophies and there were some good times under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and then Erik ten Hag, along with other glimmers of joy, but the combination of Ruben Amorim implausibly righting the sinking Old Trafford ship while Liverpool simultaneously plunge into crisis has created a satisfaction stew which might just have made October 2025 the most enjoyable month for a Manchester United fan since Sir Alex Ferguson retired.",
      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe came out in support of Amorim when reports of his sacking and talk of possible replacements were still rife despite a face-saving victory over Sunderland at the start of the month.",
      "The co-owner said he needed three years at Old Trafford to prove he’s a “great” coach; we gave him three weeks, still wholly unconvinced both by Amorim’s ability to turn things around and by the veracity of Ratcliffe’s backing of a manager with the worst record of any Man Utd boss since the halcyon Fergie days. But what a three weeks it’s been.",
      "Having incredibly failed to win consecutive Premier League games since joining the club last November, Amorim’s now won three(?!) on the bounce, with victory over fourth-placed Sunderland followed by their first win at Anfield in nearly a decade and then their latest triumph, over Brighton.",
      "And they were proper wins too, featuring some tactical nuance, game management, surprising confidence and some outstanding performances from summer signings to shift the narrative in dramatic fashion, to the point where we’re wondering what’s stopping United from qualifying for the Champions League next season.",
      "No midweek football thanks to the Europa League final and Grimsby Town defeats, while meaning scant opportunity for backups like Kobbie Mainoo, is granting Amorim plenty of time on the training ground with the players to hone ideas and implement a philosophy which they now appear to be finally getting to grips with.",
      "Senne Lammens has been a revelation in goal and Casemiro’s rejuvenation has, at least for the time being, put a stop to claims Amorim and United were doomed to perpetual false dawns at best until they signed a new No.6. Rumours of interest in Carlos Baleba, Elliot Anderson and others have been conspicuous by their absence in the last couple of weeks.",
      "The centre-backs are all playing well, with the question now not which three are less likely to screw up but which in-form defender Amorim should leave out. Lisandro Martinez’s return looks set to raise those standards even higher.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha are doing excellent work in relieving the creative pressure on the shoulders of Bruno Fernandes, who looks increasingly like the leader of Man Utd rather than a guy whining while wearing an armband.",
      "And although the jury may still be out on Benjamin Sesko, it’s testament to the work of his fellow forwards that he’s being allowed the space to ease into life in the Premier League rather than being harangued for not scoring regular goals as Rasmus Hojlund was.",
      "It’s all going swimmingly for them, and whether because of some mystical requirement for one of the two greatest English teams to be in crisis at any one time, or simply thanks to a glorious twisting of fates for the Red Devils, the aversion of their club emergency has coincided with Liverpool’s mini-crisis becoming fully fledged in October.",
      "It’s seen the Reds lose three Premier League games before dumped out of the Carabao Cup, making it six defeats in seven. Mohamed Salah has lost it. Virgil van Dijk might just be past it. Their two £100m+ players have been stratospheric flops. And Arne Slot, while making excuses that would make Jurgen Klopp or Arsene Wenger blush having been a beacon of objectivity last season, is now second in the sack race. Amorim is eighth.",
      "Having been eight points behind Liverpool after five games, after nine Man Utd are above them. And while we can’t yet know whether October 2025 will act as a line in the sand, the point when Amorim’s Man Utd truly discovered their identity before going on to great things while Slot’s Liverpool scrabbled to recover theirs to no avail before his sacking, there’s no doubt that it’s been a standout month for Red Devils fans in the post-Sir Alex era; maybe the most enjoyable of all.",
      "According to reports, head coach Ruben Amorim has informed one Manchester United star how he can become the “best in the world” in his position.",
      "We had three favourites in the Sack Race this weekend, and that is undeniably pure Barclays. Ruben Amorim is surely safe for now.",
      "In a career where you can fail upwards, we’ve taken our best guess at where every Premier League boss will be come 2030.",
      "Man Utd legend Rio Ferdinand insists Ruben Amorim is “playing Russian Roulette with his job” after refusing to change his tactics.",
      "Manchester United legend Rio Ferdinand has hit out at his former club for letting one player leave who “should have stayed”.",
      "Ruben Amorim once said that Bruno Fernandes ‘is always there when we need a goal and an assist’. That finally wasn’t the case and Man Utd should be thrilled"

      "According to reports, Manchester United have submitted a request to Premier League rivals West Ham United as they are ‘very keen’ to sign Lucas Paqueta.",
      "Man Utd‘s poor recruitment has been one of their biggest failings since club legend Sir Alex Ferguson retired, though they did buck that trend in the summer.",
      "Club chiefs recognised that a huge squad overhaul was required after Ruben Amorim‘s side finished 15th in the Premier League and failed to win a trophy in 2024/25, so they had a very busy summer.",
      "For most of the window, Man Utd focused on overhauling their attack as they invested heavily as one of the biggest spenders in Europe to sign Benjamin Sesko, Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha, while they also landed Senne Lammens to replace Andre Onana as the club’s No.1 goalkeeper.",
      "United reportedly had a limited budget at the start of the summer, though they raised funds through sanctioning several notable exits that were finalised on their terms. Permanent deals or future fees via loans with buy clauses were secured as they offloaded Rasmus Hojlund, Marcus Rashford, Alejandro Garnacho and Antony.",
      "This has reaped rewards on the pitch in recent weeks as Man Utd have hit form to ease the pressure on Amorim.",

      "For the first time under Amorim, Man Utd won back-to-back Premier League games by beating Sunderland and Liverpool before following that up with a victory against Brighton at the weekend.",
      "Lammens, Sesko, Mbeumo and Cunha have made a huge impact in recent weeks as Man Utd appear to be on track, but they still have areas to improve in the coming transfer windows.",
      "It is widely known that they need to sign a new No.6, but a report from a respected account on X with a ‘team of five elite reporters’ has revealed that they are keen on West Ham star Lucas Paqueta, who has reportedly made it clear that he wants to leave the relegation candidates in January.",
      "They tweeted: “Exclusive: Manchester United have asked for more details from West Ham regarding Lucas Paqueta transfer valuation.",
      "“We understand @ManUtd are very keen to make the deal in January at fair market valuation.",
      "“The contact was made on Wednesday lunchtime.”",
      "Regarding the No.6 department, Carlos Baleba remains one of their options after a summer deal did not go through and former coach Benni McCarthy thinks he would be a “perfect” signing for the Red Devils.",
      "“I think Carlos Baleba from Brighton. I think United needs more muscle. They need legs. They need power. And Baleba would be perfect,” McCarthy told MyBettingSites.",
      "“Alongside Kobbie, Casemiro, he’d be ideal with either of them. With Mainoo, both of them are so young, the future could not get any brighter. That would be my ideal.",
      "“They need explosiveness. They need a beast in that midfield because Casimiro is now past his best.",
      "“He’s ageing, so the club needs to start thinking about life after Casimiro, when he eventually leaves Man United, and then he leaves the team in capable hands.”"

      "Arsenal are running away with it on a tide of relentless competence, while the silliness literally everywhere else sees Tottenham third despite having four points from four games at home, Bournemouth second despite selling all of their defenders in the summer, and newly promoted Sunderland sat looking down on four of the Big Six a quarter of the way through the season, just like everyone predicted.",
      "Manchester United’s redemption has taken Ruben Amorim out of immediate contention, leaving Vitor Pereira a clear frontrunner and Nuno Espirito Santo in clear and present danger of losing his second job of the season, and title-winning Arne Slot a genuine contender as the Liverpool crisis deepens further.",
      "Meanwhile, here are possible replacement managers currently between jobs.",
      "",
      "An earlier version of this oft-updated piece speculated on what might happen to Mikel Arteta should Arsenal suffer from their Nightmare Start. What if they lost a few early games? What then? We concluded this:",
      "It’s far likelier that Arsenal emerge blinking into the autumn sunshine broadly unscathed from their nightmare horrors. No denying that this season does represent one in which Arteta might completely lose the plot and go entirely off the rails. Or the one where he wins the league by 10 points. Feels like we’re odds-on to get one or the other.",
      "Arsenal emerged duly unscathed, and have already cashed in on the shift to easier fixtures of their own alongside much tougher ones for Liverpool to take top spot in the Premier League.",
      "Only question that remains, therefore, is what Arsenal do from here. We are absolutely certain that it either involves p*ssing the league by 10 points or a complete and total meltdown. Nothing in between. We’re definitely leaning towards the former, though.",
      "READ: Who will be the next manager of Arsenal if Mikel Arteta is sacked?",
      "",
      "Doing so well that even suffering the ultimate embarrassment of defeat at Old Trafford hasn’t dampened spirits for the most impressive promoted club in quite some time.",
      "Five wins in the bag already, a five-point lead over Newcastle, and more points than Southampton managed in the entirety of 24/25. It will very much do, and importantly provides a significant buffer for Le Bris and his team as they continue a tough little run of games.",
      "",
      "It is still very early days and still too early to tell which way a promising-but-not-flawless start eventually breaks for Frank and Spurs.",
      "He arrived to a club and squad with an awful lot of mess to sort out at history’s funniest ever Champions League qualifiers. He appeared to have already thoroughly De-Anged the lot of them only for them to then turn up against Bournemouth and defend like an Ange team while attacking like a Mourinho one.",
      "You know who else won their first couple of games, including one against Man City, after stepping up to Spurs from a smaller but less daft Premier League club? That’s right. But while the Nuno comparisons are obvious, and a world in which Frank doesn’t make the November international break entirely possible, it doesn’t quite feel like the same situation.",
      "Crucially, there has been no undignified scramble to find a new manager this time. Whatever your thoughts on the timing and manner of Ange Postecoglou’s sacking and the identity of his replacement, it’s also clear Spurs have got the man they wanted in a way they very obviously didn’t when Nuno came in.",
      "That surely buys Frank a bit of time even if things do get hairy, which they will if that abysmal home form (three wins from 18 Premier League games in the last 11 months, and just one from four very winnable ones this season) can’t be sorted out. Certainly a few others going to get canned before he does. Probably.",
      "",
      "At various points we’ve expended daft amounts of energy attempting to manifest a ‘Howe Sack’ crisis because we’re messy bitches who live for drama. But we’ve never managed to make it stick even a tiny bit and we started the summer thinking there was little imminent prospect of going for it again with Howe the hero of the Geordie Nation for delivering silverware and more lovely, lovely Champions League football.",
      "Now, though, after a traumatic summer and the Alexander Isak Saga and a sometimes iffy start to the season, our Spidey Sense is tingling once more. Currently four points outside a largely daft top six, and that won’t do, no matter what the mitigation.",
      "",
      "Among the least sackable managers in the top flight, and the only club we could really picture trying to lure him away this summer was Spurs and that’s now safely off the table.",
      "It was a difficult summer for Bournemouth but Iraola had masses of credit in the bank and the excellent start they’ve made despite everything is only strengthening his standing.",
      "In truth, we can’t quite understand why he’s only mid-table here. Feels like he should be out there with Arteta. It would only make sense for him to be here if a big job were currently available, and not even Forest is available for the next six weeks or so.",
      "",
      "A sacking remains out of the question despite last season’s (relative) struggles. There hasn’t been a Premier League manager since Fergie in his pomp with more credit in the bank than Pep.",
      "But is there still a distinct chance Guardiola decides he’s had enough and simply walks away? We reckon there is, and it’s always worth remembering that we’re talking Next Premier League Manager To Leave here, and that the traditional ‘Sack Race’ shorthand is a bit misleading.",
      "Still, though. Almost no chance at this point that any of that could happen swiftly enough for nobody else to have been canned first. Especially with even a currently not entirely convincing City perhaps remaining the only halfway plausible contenders should Arsenal suffer any kind of a wobble.",
      "",
      "Funny old season for Emery already. Began the campaign right at the outside of this market with your Artetas and – unlikely as it now sounds – Slots. Then jumped right up to third favourite when Villa’s rankling disappointment at how last season ended leaked into a six-match winless start to this campaign.",
      "But it’s now been four Premier League wins in a row to thoroughly lift the mood at a club where a few short weeks ago it really did feel like they’d come to the end of something special without ever getting the definitive moment of success it deserved.",
      "Still feels like it could go either way, for club and manager, but that’s still significant progress on where they were a month ago when it felt far more certain. And not in a good way.",
      "",
      "Things would have to go unbelievably wrong unbelievably fast, but this is Everton so, you know. Maybe. And there are few things that straddle the blessing-curse divide in football quite like a new stadium.",
      "The benefits Everton should accrue come in the long term. In the short term there’s the loss of familiarity and – something that feels specifically important in this particular case – atmosphere while everyone gets used to the new surroundings.",
      "Defeat at Leeds on the opening weekend was distinctly squibbish, but Everton have bounced back in some style since to suggest they could not just survive but thrive. With Jack Grealish in impish early-season form, they might even be fun. Ending Crystal Palace’s unbeaten run in such dramatic circumstances was certainly that. Consecutive defeats without scoring against Man City and Spurs not so much.",
      "",
      "One of the key early-season imponderables for 25/26 was just how big and what kind of impact the Club World Cup might have on the way Chelsea and Man City start the season. Would they hit the ground running, or would they be a bit tired and out of sorts? For both, it’s been a little from column A, a little from column B.",
      "He definitely still has some hearts and minds to win at Chelsea despite the fine finish to the season that saw them tick off Champions League qualification while completing their collection of UEFA pots and pans and then winning the actual Club World Cup.",
      "A home draw with Crystal Palace wasn’t ideal, but the paddling dished out to West Ham has what really should at least be some kind of halfway credible title bid up and running at least. And we strongly suspect Fulham won’t be the last team left scratching their head after losing to Maresca.",
      "There was some talk of ‘Maresca out’ after a draw with Brentford but that was surely only a minority view. After losing to Manchester United in shambolic fashion, there were more on the bandwagon.",
      "That win over Liverpool was big, though, and a particularly good one for Maresca himself. The second half thumping of Forest was handy, too, albeit inevitably saying far more of their opponents than it did of Chelsea. Home defeat to Sunderland sees awkward questions resurfacing, though, ahead of what feels a particularly significant trip to Spurs at the weekend.",
      "",
      "Fine end to 24/25 put a different complexion on Brighton’s season than at one time appeared likely. Ending up a clear best of the rest outside the quickly established top seven represented at least a passing grade and they’d have to make a truly awful start to the season to get in any kind of managerial-change bother.",
      "The win over Newcastle to go with victory at Chelsea to go with a win over City reaffirms Brighton’s big-boy-bothering calibre, but does also make some of their other results – draws with Fulham and Wolves, for instance – a bit annoying. Beating three of last season’s top five in your first eight games and still being only 10th in the table feels a little bit silly.",
      "",
      "",
      "The continuity candidate in the summer, and looked to have received the ultimate hospital pass. How much continuity could there be at Brentford given they’d sold Bryan Mbeumo, Yoane Wissa and Christian Norgaard, while Thomas Frank took most of the remaining coaching staff with him to Tottenham? It was a very Brentford move to promote from within and we’ll hold our hands up and admit we thought it would go far, far worse than it has.",
      "With Liverpool added to Manchester United on the list of Gtech victims this season, it’s an undeniably impressive start in trying circumstances.",
      "",
      "Won’t be sacked, obviously, because Palace are absolutely punching with an elite-level manager who is quietly delivering astonishing results in trying circumstances.",
      "But with reports he was willing and ready to walk out if Marc Guehi was sold without a replacement point to new strains on a relationship that is bound to be tested in the weeks and months ahead.",
      "Nailed it in the Community Shield, but as ever for clubs on Palace’s level there’s a positive-and-negative scale to be balanced by your manager catching the eye so conspicuously. Glasner absolutely could be poached with bigger beasts surely paying attention to the work he’s done at Selhurst Park.",
      "And if that poaching comes from outside the Premier League, then it comes with the possibility of making Glasner the next Premier League managerial casualty. But still very unlikely.",
      "We’d imagine the lowering of the threat level for a Ruben Amorim Sack at United has eased some nerves at Selhurst Park.",
      "",
      "Forget everything we ever wrote about Ruben Amorim being doomed; he has just engineered a 2-1 win at Anfield and it’s now three wins in a row after a rollicking good fun 4-2 win over Brighton.",
      "With Forest and Spurs up next there is real scope for this to become a decent little run. That lad off the internet might even be able to get his hair cut in a couple of weeks. Amorim, meanwhile, knows ‘a couple of weeks’ is no longer the amount of time he possibly has left in the job. Everybody’s happy.",
      "",
      "Burnley really did have a horrible fixture list in these opening weeks under a manager with a horrible record at this level, and were given an opening-day reminder by the team that finished 17th last season of just how much harder the ‘simply don’t concede any goals at all’ tactic might be to deploy in the Premier League.",
      "Essentially, Burnley have got back to this level the same way Homer Simpson got to a heavyweight title fight. And Spurs and City have already given them a pummelling.",
      "Victories over Sunderland and Leeds were an impressive and necessary reminder that it might still be enough against teams more on their level, and while a 3-2 win at Wolves was not exactly The Burnley Way it’s still three points against an established – if struggling – Premier League side.",
      "This season is already a perfect reminder of just how much more fun the Premier League is when the promoted teams are capable of competing as all three are this season. We’re approaching a quarter of the way through this season, and the three promoted teams already have over three-quarters of the total points last year’s trio managed.",
      "",
      "Won his first game in charge against Porto in the Europa, and Forest played rather well too. But it’s the Premier League where Dyche will and must be judged, with getting out of relegation trouble the most obvious of primary targets. And losing as they did against Bournemouth ahead of an upcoming run that includes a resurgent Manchester United, Liverpool and a six-pointer against Leeds means it’s already quite possible to imagine the calm and thoughtful Mr Marinakis being forced into another calm and thoughtful decision about a manager he’s just appointed.",
      "",
      "It would have made Spurs’ decision to sack Europa League-winning Ange Postecoglou look positively kind, but there remains a decent case that Leeds – and Burnley for that matter – could or even should have thanked the managers who secured 100 Championship points and got them back into the big time and then sent them on their way.",
      "Farke had a dreadful Premier League record of only six wins and 26 points from his 49 games in charge of Norwich, a team he twice led to promotion from the Championship with 94 and 97 points.",
      "As well as fighting his own record in this competition, Farke faces the added burden of expectation levels very different to those at just about any other club that could possibly find itself promoted into the Premier League in this current era where that represents the most bittersweet of successes.",
      "Defeat at Burnley was honking, but bouncing back to win another six-pointer against West Ham eases the stress significantly.",
      "",
      "Fulham have hit a serious rough patch just as Silva was starting to be talked about for other jobs. Might be coincidence, might not, but the timing wasn’t great. A last-gasp defeat at Newcastle means it’s now four straight defeats, which is only keeping the Cottagers clear of the bottom three because those three teams are all currently just unspeakably awful.",
      "Still feels very much to us like Fulham and Silva are both better with each other than without, and would advise against anything hasty. Does need some points from somewhere soon, though. The good news? Wolves next.",
      "",
      "The mini-crisis has reached full-blown levels, and the uncomfortable truth is that Slot has reacted poorly. He went Full Klopp with his salty loser behaviour when Manchester United committed the crime of altering their tactics to give themselves the best chance of success against Liverpool, and the headloss continued after another chaotic and unstructured performance led to a 3-2 defeat at Brentford.",
      "Having ticked ‘opposition doing tactics wrong’ off his rattled manager bingo card, he can now add ‘losing his mind over entirely uncontroversial refereeing decisions’ with his response to both the Cody Gakpo non-penalty and Virgil van Dijk penalty at the Gtech.",
      "It has to be a worry for Liverpool that Slot has for the first time in his Anfield career found himself under any kind of pressure after this chastening run of defeats, and has suffered severe and instant headloss as a result.",
      "It’s now six defeats in the last seven games, and five straight losses in domestic competition. Slot and Liverpool simply have to pull out of this tailspin soon, or something truly extraordinary really could happen here to a man who sauntered so impressively to the Premier League title in his very first season. And there is nothing obviously helpful on the immediate horizon with Aston Villa, Real Madrid and Man City to come before an interlull Slot genuinely yet ludicrously might not survive.",
      "",
      "As a rule of thumb, you really don’t ever want to be this prominent in the Sack Race this early in the season in what is already your second job of that season. It really has been an extraordinary few months for a manager who has already this season watched his Forest side tear Brentford apart, then watched his Forest side be torn apart by West Ham, and then watched his West Ham side torn apart by Brentford.",
      "Though Nuno would be way down any list of people to blame for the Hammers’ incompetence, we do already start to wonder whether he’s the answer to any of those problems. He absolutely could be sacked twice by Christmas, with defeat at Leeds leaving West Ham already four points adrift of safety.",
      "",
      "It is the history of the Wolves. They absolutely love a sh*tbone awful start and enforced managerial change around November. The loss of key players and a disappointingly limp finish to last season after that thrilling run of wins through March and April mean those old doubts were nagging away even before a woeful pre-season, an opening-day paddling from new-look, old-destructiveness Man City and further defeats to Bournemouth, Everton, Newcastle United, Leeds and now, really damagingly, Sunderland after a pair of encouraging draws.",
      "Pereira should theoretically be fine after the work he did in steering Wolves so comfortably clear of any relegation trouble last season contributed heavily to him being give a new three-year contract in September. But making terrible starts that leave them in apparent relegation trouble before surviving comfortably in the end after a managerial change appears to now be ingrained in the club culture, an issue that transcends players and managers.",
      "Looked set to get the full benefit of good ol’ Dr Tottenham before having to settle for a point that really should have been three; they were much the better side in a low-quality caper.",
      "Sent off in the 1-1 draw with Brighton for ‘irresponsible behaviour in the technical area’. Which we just love. Was he running with scissors? Did he return to a lit firework? Purchase alcohol for some youths?",
      "But defeat to Burnley in a rollercoaster six-pointer leaves things looking bleak indeed for Pereira.",
      "According to reports, head coach Ruben Amorim has informed one Manchester United star how he can become the “best in the world” in his position.",
      "Does the combination of Ruben Amorim implausibly righting the Man Utd ship while Liverpool plunge into crisis make October 2025 the best post-Fergie month of all?",
      "In a career where you can fail upwards, we’ve taken our best guess at where every Premier League boss will be come 2030.",
      "Man Utd legend Rio Ferdinand insists Ruben Amorim is “playing Russian Roulette with his job” after refusing to change his tactics.",
      "Manchester United legend Rio Ferdinand has hit out at his former club for letting one player leave who “should have stayed”.",
      "Ruben Amorim once said that Bruno Fernandes ‘is always there when we need a goal and an assist’. That finally wasn’t the case and Man Utd should be thrilled"

      "",
      "Okay, someone asked for some considered opinions, and, as we’re a quarter of the way through*, here goes…",
      "*Quiet at the back!",
      "Arsenal – can’t criticise them for not winning it (note, not ‘bottling’) and then criticise them for trying to win it however they so desire. Will they even concede another goal?! I think they finally do win it, and people still complain. Hey Stewie!",
      "Bournemouth – selling that vast majority of their defence seems like a bold strategy that’s paying off. They’re pretty good at finding players, aren’t they?! Will fade a little, but I think a European spot may beckon.",
      "Spurs – Hang on!?! How are they 3rd? Fair play. Does the away from crack before the home form improves? They will finish 7th. Does Solanke have a chant to The Police’s ‘So Lonely’?",
      "Sunderland – Uh, have you not got the ‘please relegate yourself imposter’ memo? Xhaka the signing that’s made the biggest impact thus far. Will stay up comfortably. Possibly half way to the tally they need to do so. Hearing Isidor’s name always makes me want to watch Lord of the Rings. I know, I know, it’s Isildur.",
      "Man City – They’re just not quite them, are they. Their ‘title challenge’ will see them 4/5 points off all the way through.",
      "Man Utd – No jokes here. Definite strides being made. It just feels like that fragility (and an Amorim meltdown) could return at any time still. At the moment.",
      "Liverpool – Was a curious summer with some seemingly unnecessary signings. More bumps in the road to come (early CL exit) before steadying improvement post Jan. Won it last year, so it could be Wirtz.",
      "Aston Villa – The greasy breakfast seems to have finally allowed the hangover to be shaken off. Tielemans can’t come back soon enough. Win the Europa League and nothing else matters. Won’t do in Spurs style if they do, however.",
      "Chelsea – Champs League games (where they actually have to play a decent XI) taking a toll? I can see up and down season in store. Really though, I just don’t care either way. Which is a weird thing to say. Is Maresca the distinctly average one?",
      "Crystal Palace – Rightly lauded and yet somehow still sit 10th. It’s a skill really. Could see another cup win. Excellent fans.",
      "Brentford – Oh, Keith. Keith, Keith, Keith… Just stop it! Take your first management job from a fella who’d been there a while and was loved, lose your best forward players, and don’t give a shit. Excellent work you likeable so-and-so.",
      "Newcastle – It feels fine, and sort of is. But is it? Will report back later.",
      "Brighton – Same as it ever was. Which isn’t necessarily a bad thing. Cause the big boys trouble, look average elsewhere.",
      "Everton – A shiny stadium and a fun Jack Grealish. Just enjoy it all. No danger whatsoever.",
      "Leeds – Home form will dictate everything, and they will need 25+ points from their home games.",
      "Burnley – See above. Winning at Wolves doesn’t count.",
      "Fulham – Maybe try going to back to the mid table obscurity thing. This doesn’t look great. Will beat Arsenal at the Emirates just to get everyone jittery.",
      "Forest – The admiration and good graces of fans of other teams thrown away in the space of a few months. Almost impressive. I don’t like saying it, but I don’t think I’d be upset to see them relegated.**",
      "West Ham – ‘I’m addicted to you, don’t you know that I’m Toxic’. It looks bleak. Very bleak. Get out Jarrod. Get out! Villa Park is nice.",
      "Wolves – Not sure the ‘be crap to start with, sack the manager, and improve no end’ bit is going to work this season. They finish in 20th despite an excellent challenge from above.",

      "It is the responsibility of both teams to try and win a match. If one club goes to another, and sits all its men behind the ball, has no ambition to do anything other than defend and hope to get a counter, I would say the poor quality of the match and the football itself, is not the fault of the team trying to win the match, but the one trying desperately hard not to lose it.",
      "In this tortuous analogy, Arsenal are the team who actually want to win their matches, and their opponents are the ones desperate not to lose.",
      "So you can be upset that Arsenal score goals from set pieces and that might be ruining the ‘quality’ of the league, but at least we want to try and win. Considering our opponents average an xG against us of 0.8 per game, it tells me they aren’t even trying to score, whereas ours is 1.6 in comparison.",
      "Your craven clubs, with the hundreds of millions spent by them, are still too scared and lack the ambition to even want to try and win. So get mad at your own clubs and players for ruining the league. As an Arsenal fan, I love 1-nil results. I was raised on them. Bould at the near post flick on to someone in the middle. It was beautiful that George Graham was at the ground to witness our 1-nil against Palace (who are an excellent team).",

      "Suddenly, corners and set pieces are a widespread problem. I wonder why? The Arsenal freaks on Twitter are thankfully doing the Lord’s Work and pulling up tweets from official accounts of United or Liverpool or whoever, who are actually ‘bragging’ about their set piece specialists from once upon a time, while genuinely intelligent people such as Jon MacKenzie are asking if we should implement rule changes!! Wtf are we doing here honestly?",
      "Someone has also found a video of Jamie Carragher praising Chelsea’s ability to turn set pieces into goals about six years ago, while he and Freddie Ljungberg laugh together about how Arsene Wenger neglected the coaching of these scenarios in training, and that was probably a bit of a mistake. Quite funny, in hindsight.",
      "Honestly, you couldn’t make up what you’re seeing right now on the cesspit platform. All of this is the TLDR way of saying: Jamo, we are not bragging about anything. We are not yet in November and we’ve been burnt thrice in a row by one thing or another (our fault or otherwise), so you are clearly either looking in the wrong place or completely making it up.",

      "In an attempt to move on from the hyperbolic headlines, here is my attempt at diagnosing the problems and potential solutions to the poor run of form at Liverpool.",
      "Problems:",
      "Evolution from 433: Clearly this years’ signings marked an evolutionary move from Liverpool’s long serving 433 formation. Slot admitted that the signings were intended to give us more flexibility in the way we lined up against teams. Wirtz a clear number 10 means we were at times moving away from Klopp’s 6 and two 8s and Slot’s two 6s and an 8. It is also a clear move away from a team which gets its running and physicality from 3 midfielders with creativity provided by the full backs and the attackers. MacAllister and Wirtz are a long way from Hendo and Gini. Wirtz is most like Coutinho who didn’t fit within the 433 and had to leave. Buying Wirtz for 9 figures means we are moving away from 433 which will naturally unsettle some players who have played it for years. I see the logic in having someone like Wirtz to unlock the low block which Liverpool often face.",
      "The combined signing of Isak and Wirtz suggest a possible move away from 3 up front or certainly configuring the 3 differently. Is Slot’s ultimate long term vision 2 upfront, Wirtz at the tip of a diamond midfield behind, with Frimpong and Kerkez providing the width and legs?",
      "Leaking goals: Whether it’s the change in the formation, change in players or just poor form. Liverpool have leaked goals particularly of late.",
      "Missing Trent: I hope the long-time critics of TAA can see the error of their ways. Defensively Trent was never as bad as people alleged and Liverpool have not locked down the right hand side of the defence since he left. Issues on the right were never Trent being ‘the worst defender’ in the world. They were chiefly the result of Salah not tracking back and neither Milner or Henderson being replaced to fill in the gap.",
      "There is a Trent shaped hole in this team from an attacking perspective. It lacks creativity from deep and the ability to turn defence into attack with one quick pass",
      "Salah out of form: No one misses Trent more than Salah whose form has dipped noticeably. No one expected last year again but he has been poor. He has not found the right chemistry with teammates on the right. The lack of a consistent ball over the top (Trent!) means he is easier to mark. Putting Wirtz into midfield means there is one less person to do his running leaving us badly exposed to pace on the opposition left (Semenya, Eze, Mbuemo etc…). If I zoom out, I think in the absence of Trent, Salah is more likely to drift infield to an inside right position which I think is really where Wirtz would like to play. Really what we are seeing is the painful transition from a Salah led offense to a Wirtz led offence. It is now a question of how soon this happens.",
      "Big names, small performances: New signings have not settled. Isak in a red shirt is still miles from Isak in a Newcastle shirt. Frimpong is supposed to bring pace on the right to provide an overlap for Wirtz and others creating from midfield. He has had a shaky start and doesn’t seem to be a defensive upgrade from Trent. Wirtz has not looked like the best player in Germany and doesn’t seem to know where he should play. He looks for time he’s not going to get in the PL. Most disappointing for me has been Kerkez who isn’t adapting to a new league and should have been an immediate improvement on the left. He has been physically weak and reckless in tackles.",
      "MacAllister has been poor in every aspect of the game from tackling to passing and has rightly been dropped for Jones. Konate had a shocking start to the season and there is a risk his head has been turned. Salah, see above.",
      "Missing Allison: The new keeper does not look like the best young keeper in the world. He’s been nervous coming and dealing with crosses and dived too soon twice for Brentford goals. It was tough watching Kelleher for Brentford on Saturday. When you miss Allison you miss a keeper who makes saves he shouldn’t and is lethal in one on ones.",
      "Brass tax, Liverpool have conceded 7 in GM’s 3 PL games vs. 7 in Allison’s 6 PL games.",
      "Look at the 3 games and the goals conceded and ask would Allison save it? Mbuemo definitely, Caicaido he could have and the Brentford goals he would certainly have done better.",
      "Solutions:",
      "Sort the defence first. It applies to Sunday league and premier league alike. You cannot win games conceding too many goals. We need to get a defence sorted. For me that means putting Gomez at RB and Robbo at LB. Play a flat back 4. If the game requires it, start Endo at the base of MF until RG is fit again. This also means getting midfielders and wingers to put in a shift to cover the defence.",
      "Continue everyone is droppable: Salah and MacAllister have rightly been dropped for playing badly. This needs to be the case. Chiesa and Jones deserve their chances and if they don’t get them now then they have to leave the club. Past performances and big transfer fees shouldn’t guarantee a player a spot either. Isak and Wirtz similarly need to be droppable.",
      "Play Szoboszlai in MF: He’s our only shining light this season. Just start him in midfield every game, no messing around at RB. Play him at 6 or 8. With RG out we should start him at 6 for now.",
      "Use the injuries to settle the team: Injuries mean there are less options and allows the team to settle a bit. Isak being injured means continuing with 3 upfront and playing Hugo at 9. This should always have been the case but it’s easier to have the big transfer injured than dropped. Jones and RG being out means playing an offensive midfield 3 of Macallister, DS and Wirtz which makes the solid 4 at the back even more important. Hopefully this will see MacAllister and Salah settle and find their form but if that doesn’t happen Chiesa and Endo should be put in.\nPL from DL",

It was a Liverpool player who made that howler; if it was Mbeumo who did it then 150% stop play but it seems like something rife for gaming the system if play gets stopped because teammates run into each other and someone goes down holding their head. Ed more than welcome to tell me if I’m talking bollocks",
      "With regards to the stitches, having worked at sea for 10+ years, I’ve had (cumulatively) 7 staples and 12 stitches in my head over three separate occasions, it’s nothing more than an elaborate boo boo that McAllister definitely made the most of and considering there was no actual concussion test or anything that I saw, in hindsight, I think the ref got it right.",
      "Ryan, Bermuda: All salient points made, well done that man – and decent PS from Ed. Which leads me on to one of my bugbears in football. A defender can often come sliding through, absolutely clattering a striker after they have had a shot without any censure because of some weird logic that they’ve already had a shot without any consideration to the fact that an uncontrolled ~100kgs of defender sliding at the striker across the turf at 20km/h, may have in fact, put the striker off.",
      "Essentially, if the defender tackles late enough, he can put the striker off and foul him without any punishment. It is truly baffling and Ryan certainly is Me when I scratch my head at some of the rules, the opaqueness of their application and disaster refereeing. I know we have more chance of Maggie rising from her grave to vote for the Green Party, but I do think we should all, as Prem fans, start making more noise for the rules, VAR and refereeing to be MUCH MORE professionally applied to the Prem.",

      "We all nodded in agreement with Dave Tickner’s sage assertion that while Elanga might not be worth £55m to any other team he is to Newcastle because of their excellence in transition on the counter-attack, but are now very much distancing ourselves from that fool of a journalist/man. No goals, just one assist and now spending most of his time watching Jacob Murphy from the bench.",

He’s started just two Premier League games as Alejandro Garnacho is now Enzo Maresca’s preferred choice on the left, but did impress in the 5-1 win over Ajax in the Champions League.",
      "The German media claimed after another so-so performance from Wirtz in his national team’s victory over Northern Ireland that the poor lad ‘has forgotten his joy’, and that feels like a very accurate assessment of his Liverpool career to date.",
      "It’s impossible to know how big a problem he is in a sea of problems for Arne Slot, but he was never a solution.",

      "\"It's hard to say that. Sometimes, in some moments,\" he said. \"There were some moments that were tough to deal with, to lose so many games. That was so hard for me because this is Manchester United.",
      "\"The position that we had in the last year, putting all the attention on the Europa League and not winning. That was massive. I had some moments that I struggled a lot and I was thinking that maybe it's not meant to be.",

      "\"It's hard to say. We need to think positively, but we also need to be prepared that football is [up and down]. And we are not that team that I can say to you, no, no, no.",
      "\"Now we can lose here or there, but we are going to maintain. I trust in my players more. I think they trust me more. That will come with wins. And you can sense that because everyone now is saying that, how connected they are and they believe in the manager.",
      "\"It's about winning games. It didn't change a lot because against Arsenal, I saw the same team, so I don't know.",
      "\"I think that we are in a better place, but it's also really good to be always with that feeling and prepare that something can change. If we have that feeling, we'll pay attention to the details and we'll maintain that course of our path.",

      "The former Everton boss did also go on to say Amorim should get time to continue his work at the club.",
      "On Thursday, Amorim said: \"First of all, maybe it is true that if we play in a 4-4-2 we won more games. But I always say that I have a way of playing that is going to take a while and then in the future it is going to be better.",
      "\"We don't know that. I can look at Sean Dyche as a manager and a pundit. If you are a pundit and you don't say very strong things, I don't want to watch you. I am the same.",

      "\"He understands that there is one thing seeing the game and talking about it. It is another thing to coach a team.\"",
      "Dyche, also speaking on Thursday, said he didn't question Amorim as a person and that \"clickbait kills everything, it changes the whole story\".",
      "He added: \"They said, 'What would be a fair timeline?' and I said, 'Half a season to continue the work he was doing' but unfortunately, that doesn't make the story, we all know that.",
      "\"For the points tally, I was suggesting maybe the basics would have worked better. They have changed their style, fair play to him, his coaching staff, the players. They have changed their style, not necessarily their beliefs, but just their style.",
      "\"They are being a bit quicker to play forwards and longer, a bit tighter and getting back into their shape. That's management, that's coaching.",
      "\"That doesn't mean he's changed his whole philosophy, it just means he's adapting it to the challenge that's right in front of him. Fair play to him.\"",

      "Thursday 30 October 2025 20:52, UK",
      "Our football betting expert Jones Knows provides his insight across the Premier League and he isn't ready to trust Manchester United at short prices.",
      "A solid betting tactic to use is to give Brighton respect against the big boys and back them to be flaky against the rest.",
      "The Seagulls can turn Manchester City into mush one week, then turn into mush themselves the next against a team battling relegation. All three of Ipswich, Southampton and Leicester avoided defeat at the Amex last season and Brighton have already failed to beat Wolves this campaign when odds-on to do so.",
      "Against sides who sit in, frustrate and counter at speed, they often struggle to convert dominance into results. And Leeds possess the fourth best defensive process in the Premier League this season (9.23 expected goals against). They can make this another fiddly afternoon for the hosts with 10/11 with Sky Bet on Leeds double chance standing out.",
      "Some bets just make sense. Sometimes the obvious ones are the ones laced with the most value.",
      "You look at the numbers, you look at the patterns, you look at the opposition and you can almost hear the value whispering in your ear, saying \"back Arsenal to win to nil.\"",
      "Yes, the 10/11 with Sky Bet isn't going to change lives but it's a rock-solid play that over time will keep you ahead of the ledger in this battle against the oddsmakers. Arsenal's defensive record isn't just good, it's title-winning, elite, brick-wall good. They've now conceded just three goals in their last 14 matches across all competitions, winning 11 of those without conceding.",
      "If Arsenal win, they almost always do it whilst keeping their sheets clean. And Burnley, for all their endeavour, look ill-equipped to change that narrative.",
      "Yeremy Pino's start to life at Crystal Palace has been like a sparkler in a petrol station: lively, unpredictable and very dangerous. And that's exactly why Pino to either score or be carded at 5/4 with Sky Bet looks a cracking bet this weekend. Pino has the desire be involved - one way or another - with or without the ball.",
      "Since arriving in south London, he's been averaging 2.5 shots per 90, getting into the central areas of the box regularly and showing exactly the kind of low-centre-of-gravity menace that is hard to mark - as seen by his classy goal at Anfield in midweek.",
      "But there's a flip side. For all that flair, there's a fiery edge. He leaves a leg in when the ball's gone and doesn't take kindly to being kicked himself. He's already been carded in three appearances which backs up his card-happy data from Spain where he was booked 12 times last season at a very healthy rate of 0.52 per 90.",
      "Fulham's new attacking livewire Kevin looks to have finally found his feet after being integrated into Marco Silva's system. And for those of us sniffing around the shots on target markets, he's shaping up as a player to follow over the next few weeks. Over his last few appearances, he's been popping up in dangerous areas, pulling defenders apart with his movement and, most importantly, shooting.",
      "He had seven shots in the midweek win on penalties against Wycombe, hitting the target three times. It's time for him now to be trusted in a Premier League game and the 2/1 with Sky Bet for him to have two or more shots on target is brimming with potential.",
      "Some teams make you feel safe when they're hovering around Evens away from home: Manchester City, Arsenal and Liverpool, spring to mind.",
      "However, betting Manchester United at these prices is like going back to the ex who says: \"I've changed.\"",
      "You want to believe them, but deep down, you know exactly how this ends with hearts broken, fingers burnt and wallets bruised.",
      "This version of United under Ruben Amorim remain a deeply unreliable, defensively chaotic team. And that makes them punting poison at short prices like they are here at 21/20 with Sky Bet to win at Forest, meaning the home team on the double chance at 8/11 with Sky Bet is the confident play.",
      "Defensively, they're still hanging on by their fingernails. They've conceded 22 big chances in the Premier League this season, more than any other team. That's not bad luck, that's structural fragility, especially in the central midfield area.",
      "A low-scoring home win it is.",
      "You know a Premier League season has gone a bit rogue when Micky van de Ven, a centre-back who failed to score last season, is Tottenham's top scorer with five goals. But here we are. And for punters, that is where the value hides.",
      "Because at 14/1 with Sky Bet to score anytime against Chelsea, the Dutchman looks a cracking price in a season where defenders have suddenly become the headline acts.",
      "This Premier League season is producing record levels of goals from corners and free-kicks, something which still isn't being factored into the markets. Excluding penalties, 67 of the 241 goals scored this season have come via a set-piece (27.8 per cent). And 45 of those 241 goals scored have come via corners (18.7 per cent), a higher proportion than any other Premier League season.",
      "At 14/1 anytime, Van de Ven's implied probability is just 6.7 per cent. Given his form, Spurs' relentless set-piece output and Chelsea's defending, that number underplays the true probability.",
      "As Liverpool head into a pivotal stretch of their season, the smartest play might just be trusting Arne Slot to get it right again at a time where the narrative is portraying him as someone who is out of his depth.",
      "Because if the title-winning campaign taught us anything, it's that Slot knows how to manage chaos, rotate wisely and keep his squad peaking while others run out of steam.",
      "When Liverpool lifted the Premier League trophy last season, it wasn't just about tactics and in-game substitutions, it was about player management. Slot got the blend between rotation and rhythm spot-on. He trusted his fringe players and made brave calls in the league that left his stars fresh for the big days. That's what this fixture is for Liverpool: a big one.",
      "And Slot knows it, hence why he's sacrificed the Carabao Cup in order to reboot his key players. It's the product of a manager who understands when to gamble and when to protect.",
      "Slot's already proven he can navigate the chaos better than anyone else. He can get Liverpool moving in the right direction again - starting here where the home win is generously priced at 4/6 with Sky Bet.",
      "West Ham remain unfit for purpose in this Premier League season as they've become a plodding, predictable outfit who are easily bullied.",
      "And this is a terrible match-up for them against perhaps the most aggressive and intense team on these shores.",
      "Joelinton, Bruno Guimaraes, Sandro Tonali and Anthony Gordon all will be licking their lips at winning their individual battles and I'm expecting Newcastle to be at it from the first whistle in order to turn the pressure up on the home players in front of their own fans, who have now seen nine games without a win at home, including five defeats in a row.",
      "Eddie Howe is a marginal gains type of manager and he'll know a fast start to get the home fans turned will be a key tactic to win this match.",
      "So, the way to boost the 8/13 with Sky Bet on a Newcastle win is just to concentrate on the first half. West Ham have scored just four first half goals in their last 20 matches and none in the last seven. Back the Toon to win the first half at 11/10 with Sky Bet.",
      "Bournemouth are a punters pal when it comes to over goal lines away from home as 14 of their last 16 matches on the road have sailed over the 2.5 line. And since the start of last season their away games against last season's top five have averaged 3.9 goals per 90.",
      "However, with the Premier League only trending at 2.68 goals per 90 this season, which is almost 0.6 of a goal fewer than two seasons ago, I'm a little wary of backing over lines.",
      "The smarter play when your read on a game is for goals is to slide across into the goalscorer markets instead and chase a bigger price. Antoine Semenyo, who has scored eight goals in last 10 Premier League appearances, is the play at 7/2 with Sky Bet.",
      "Looking at the data, Bournemouth's aim is to get him into dangerous positions in transition and City will leave spaces to be hit via that tactic. In what should be a goal heavy game, simply backing him to score at 7/2 is the smartest way to get a goals and pro Bournemouth play on side.",
      "Everyone's talking about Jack Grealish, yet, he's not even Everton's best player.",
      "If you actually use your eyes rather than just concentrate on the Grealish love-in, it's Iliman Ndiaye who's running the show in the final third. He's the one drifting between the lines, wriggling into pockets of space defenders hate and, crucially for us punters, is getting into shooting positions with real intent. Something that Grealish isn't doing.",
      "Ndiaye has already scored three goals this season - two more than Grealish. He's had seven shots on target - three more than Grealish and his expected goals return is higher by 1.5 expected goals than Grealish.",
      "He's also the penalty taker for Everton, meaning the anytime goalscorer price of 3/1 with Sky Bet being dangled is too juicy to pass up. You're effectively investing at 3/1 in Everton's most advanced and most involved attacking player who also could have a free shot from 12 yards if the ref points to the spot."

      "His tally of six goals in only 760 minutes includes two ingenious flicked finishes, one against Union Saint-Gilloise and an even better one against Brighton. There was a penalty lifted into the top corner against Nottingham Forest as if struck with a pitching wedge.",
      "It is a fitting level of variety for a player who is difficult to define. Woltemade has the physical profile to play the role of a targetman. His presence has allowed Newcastle to send more passes long in line with the Premier League's shift towards directness.",
      "He has scored headed goals against Wolves and Arsenal as well Spurs. Not many strikers can claim to have bested Gabriel Magalhaes this season but Woltemade towered over him when scoring Newcastle's opener against the Gunners in September.",

      "His team-mates certainly value his all-round contribution. \"He is so big, it is a little bit easy for him to score goals with his head but he is a very good player,\" said Sandro Tonali after the Spurs game.",
      "\"He runs all 90 minutes every time. He plays with us, the midfielders and the defenders. He is the first defender and the first striker.\" Eddie Howe added that he \"set the tone\" for Newcastle's pressing.",
      "He is already loved by Newcastle supporters. His arrival, for £69m from Stuttgart in the summer, having previously been a target for Bayern Munich, has helped to ensure that, so far, at least, the departed Alexander Isak has not been missed.",
      "It has escaped nobody's attention that Woltemade has comprehensively outperformed his predecessor, who is yet to score in the Premier League for Liverpool, his only goal since his record £125m transfer coming in the Carabao Cup against Southampton.",
      "Yoane Wissa's injury absence has added to the pressure on Woltemade to perform and he continues to deliver. He has more Premier League goals, with four, than any of the 18 other strikers signed by Premier League clubs during a summer transfer window which featured unprecedented spending on forwards.",
      "It is all the more impressive given he has played fewer minutes than many of the other players in the list, including all of Chelsea's Joao Pedro, Arsenal's Viktor Gyokeres, Liverpool's Hugo Ekitike and Manchester United's Benjamin Sesko.",
      "He is of course a different type of player to the man he has replaced. He is not generating as many shots or creating as many chances as Isak last term but he offers an aerial outlet, wins more duels, makes more pressures and regains possession more frequently.",
      "His heat map shows a broader remit.",
      "While Isak was focused on stretching opposition defences with runs in behind, Woltemade is more likely to be seen further away from goal, helping to construct attacks as well as finish them.",
      "Woltemade is still acclimatising to certain aspects of the Premier League. Issa Diop and Calvin Bassey subjected him to rough treatment which often went unpunished against Fulham last weekend, much to the striker's frustration.",
      "But overall the speed of his adaptation has been hugely impressive. His challenge now is just to continue in the same vein.",
      "So, is his current scoring rate sustainable? Woltemade has scored four goals from four shots on target in the Premier League. Factor in his goals in the Champions League and Carabao Cup and, amazingly, it is six from six shots on target overall.",
      "He has reached that tally from chances worth only 3.46 expected goals, an overperformance which suggests a reversion to the mean may lie ahead. And yet, his actual goal total could easily be higher.",
      "Woltemade hit the post from close range in last weekend's 2-1 win over Fulham and struck the underside of the crossbar in the game against Nottingham Forest, during which he also had a goalbound effort blocked by defender Morata inside the six-yard box.",
      "Newcastle may ultimately need to service him with more scoring opportunities. They will need their wingers to contribute more goals too, with Jacob Murphy, Harvey Barnes, Anthony Gordon and Anthony Elanga having only found the net once in the Premier League between them so far this season.",
      "But in Woltemade right now, they have a player giving them exactly what they need, filling an Isak-shaped void, contributing a lot more than just goals, and, two months into the season, winning the battle of the Premier League's new No 9s.",
      "From Newcastle to Brighton, where it has been a slower start for Charalampos Kostoulas, another of the Premier League's newly-signed strikers having joined from Olympiakos for £31.4m in June.",
      "The 18-year-old came with a reputation as one of Europe's most exciting young frontmen and finally earned a first start in Brighton's Carabao Cup tie against Arsenal on Wednesday having scored his first goal from the bench against Manchester United.",
      "Unfortunately for him, it did not last long.",
      "Kostoulas looked menacing from the left flank in the first half at the Emirates Stadium but he was withdrawn at the interval with Fabian Hurzeler citing \"physical reasons\" afterwards.",
      "\"He needs to adapt to the intensity of the Premier League, he needs to adapt to the demands,\" said the Brighton boss.",
      "The 32-year-old talked up the importance of \"honest feedback\" having been firm with Baleba over his performances following a summer of transfer speculation. Hurzeler has taken him off at half-time on three separate occasions this season. \"Carlos won't get better if he only gets compliments and claps from outside,\" he said.",
      "Clearly, Hurzeler is pushing Kostoulas in the same way. And even if it feels uncomfortable, the striker should keep in mind that his team-mate appears to have benefitted. Baleba was Brighton's best performer against Arsenal, dominating the midfield in the first half and demonstrating the potential Hurzeler is trying to extract.",
      "No Dean Huijsen, no problem for Bournemouth. They have another young gem at centre-back in Veljko Milosavljevic.",
      "The 18-year-old Serb is pushing to face Erling Haaland and Manchester City on Super Sunday having helped Bournemouth keep a clean sheet against Nottingham Forest last time out.",
      "Sunderland host Everton on Monday Night Football. Tune in from 6.30pm ahead of the 8pm kick-off.",
      "Joao Palhinha, Rodrigo Bentancur and Tottenham's issues playing through midfield featured in last week's column. There was also a look at Bruno Fernandes' stunning record for Man Utd ahead of his 300th appearance."

      "Manchester United director of football Jason Wilcox has promised investment in the \"right\" signings in order to realise the club's long-term vision.",
      "United have hit a groove of positivity, having won three league games on the bounce for the first time since boss Ruben Amorim's appointment last November.",
      "Summer signings Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Senne Lammens have played their role in United's upturn in form, with fans impressed with not only their performances but their evident attitude.",
      "United's recent transfer success is a trend that Wilcox suggests will continue at Old Trafford as the club aim to re-establish themselves at the top of the Premier League, as well as being capable of competing in Europe.",
      "\"We have got a clear plan,\" Wilcox told the Man Utd website.",
      "\"We know what we have got to do, we know the areas of the team that we have got to improve.",
      "\"For us to get in the top four and consistently challenge for Champions League places, win Champions League, win Premier League, we have got to invest in the squad.",
      "\"We have got to buy the right players. The right players who are talented but also who can deal with the pressure, who can take the squad forward. It is not always about just signing elite talent, they have got to have the right character and be somebody who can bring something different to the team.\"",
      "United's summer transfer window is likely to be an important one given the fact that some members of the squad are approaching the final six months of their current deals, such as Casemiro and Harry Maguire. United had looked at possible options in the middle last summer but had prioritised other positions, especially up front. However, potential outgoings present an opportunity to strengthen in the middle of the park.",
      "The Old Trafford club have long been admirers of Brighton's Carlos Baleba - but he is just one of a number of midfielders they continue to monitor.",
      "Nottingham Forest's Elliot Anderson is another on the radar Old Trafford, given his impressive performances have continued into this campaign.",
      "While transfer business is not on the immediate agenda, Wilcox heaped praise on United's summer acquisitions, who he says are guiding the club in the right direction on the pitch.",
      "\"They are all good guys,\" Wilcox said.",
      "\"Even from last summer's window, they are top professionals, top players and we are really optimistic we are going in the right direction.",
      "\"I am sure there are going to be bumps in the road but we have just got to make sure we stay calm irrespective of the noise outside.",
      "\"I see the intensity, I am at training every day, I see the way that they train, the way they apply themselves, the way they communicate and get on with each other.",
      "\"Like I say, when you lose football matches you are always going to be a little bit disappointed and especially at this club.\"",

      "By Danyal Khan and Rob Dorsett",
      "Thursday 30 October 2025 09:23, UK",
      "Manchester United bosses are quietly satisfied with their progress after securing three straight wins for the first time in 18 months - but know there is still much to do before the men's team can compete regularly at the top of the table.",
      "The team's recent run of impressive results has not been met with overt celebrations in the executive offices at the Carrington training ground. Rather, it has reassured the club hierarchy that the tough decisions taken are starting to have an impact on the pitch and strengthened their resolve to continue with the long-term plan.",
      "Ruben Amorim has targeted a place in Europe for next season, and certainly chief executive Omar Berrada and director of football Jason Wilcox would be satisfied with a top-six finish. As Amorim continues to develop his squad, no one at the club is getting too high when the team are on a positive run, or too low when results are disappointing.",
      "Crucially, while there is abundant noise outside Old Trafford calling for some heavy investment in the squad in January, among the executives there is a determination to stick to the plan. United are not expected to spend big in the New Year.",
      "A new defensive midfield player is the priority to strengthen the squad, after last summer's focus on attacking areas. But because a No 6 is likely to mean a significant level of investment - with Elliot Anderson, Adam Wharton and Carlos Baleba all under consideration - it is much more likely to be addressed in the summer, as part of a broader review of the squad and the overall wage bill.",
      "The strategy was successful in the summer in terms of reducing a bloated and expensive squad, moving on many of the big-earning players who weren't part of Amorim's plans. But there is also an awareness that the futures of a number of Manchester United's highest-profile players are still up in the air.",
      "However determined Marcus Rashford is to pursue his career away from Manchester, he still has two-and-a-half years remaining on his United contract. Harry Maguire and Casemiro are both out of contract in the summer, and so any decision to let either move on would free up a significant chunk in the squad salary budget. Rasmus Hojlund's substantive move to Napoli is only guaranteed should Antonio Conte's side make the Champions League.",
      "All of those considerations will impact what incoming transfer business United can do, but there is a determination to avoid some of the recruitment mistakes of the past, which saw too many big names on big salaries sitting in the big Old Trafford stands.",
      "The summer focus on strengthening the attack seems to be paying dividends. Manchester United's xG has actually been lower over the last three matches compared to the first six games of the season - but the statistics make it clear United are being much more clinical in front of goal, with a very impressive 20 per cent of their shots producing goals this month, compared to just 7.4 per cent previously.",
      "The style of play has been tweaked, too, with United going more direct. Over the last three matches, they've averaged less than 44 per cent possession compared with over 53 per cent for the rest of the season. And with Senne Lammens between the posts, he has kicked long for almost 85 per cent of the time, compared to 43 per cent and 56 per cent under Andre Onana and Altay Bayindir, respectively.",
      "United had no plans to change goalkeeper in the summer, despite their long-term interest in Lammens. But Onana's dip in form, and Jadon Sancho's wages being removed from the overall bill, meant a deal could be done for the 23-year-old.",
      "The stats suggest he has made a difference on the pitch. A 78.6 per cent save rate is more than 11 per cent better than Onana's, and more than 25 per cent ahead of Bayindir.",
      "It is also significant that the focus on Amorim's chosen formation of three central defenders has waned.",
      "But there have been signs in the last few games that the Portuguese coach has adopted a more flexible approach to his team structure. Even though Manchester United line up with three at the back, that sometimes becomes a four when they are defending, with one or both of the wing-backs dropping deeper.",
      "An increasingly positive mood is becoming obvious to those inside Carrington. After the defeat to Brentford last month, it would have been characteristic of the recent United past for stories to start leaking out about certain players being unhappy, or others losing faith in the head coach. There were no such stories this time, which suggests there is greater unity in the squad than has been seen for a while, and a widespread buy-in to the coaching methods.",
      "United's bosses know they are still in the early stages of their revolution. And they expect some rocky roads ahead as they search for stability and, ultimately, silverware.",
      "But, for the time being at least, all is quiet at Carrington, as the club's power brokers feel things are moving in the right direction.",
      "Super 6 are starting the season by guaranteeing a £1,000,000 winner! Play for free."

      "Analysing some of the biggest talking points from the latest round of Premier League matches, including a new wave of set-piece creativity, Man City's lack of identity and Man Utd's recent momentum after three wins on the spin",
      "Monday 27 October 2025 14:28, UK",
      "Before Super Sunday, Everton were the only team yet to concede from a set-piece in the Premier League. Given the prolificacy of set-piece goals this season that fact is impressive. What followed in a 3-0 defeat to Thomas Frank's Tottenham, though, was Micky van de Ven tucking away twice from corners.",
      "It would seem no team is immune to the set-piece phenomenon sweeping through the league.",
      "This is not a radically new idea. And it's a matter of personal preference as to whether this development is having a positive or negative effect on entertainment value. Fashion isn't always about aesthetics. Sometimes it's about practicality. If the best wearing pair of jeans only look good on the hanger, then really they serve no purpose at all.",
      "Nineteen per cent of all English top-flight goals this season have come via corners (45/241), the highest proportion ever in a Premier League campaign. Arsenal are the masters of this art. Gabriel is so effective, in fact, Jamie Carragher has called him the \"most influential player in the league\" right now.",
      "It's true that Mikel Arteta has got his team delivering machine-like efficiency. Arsenal have scored 11 goals via set-pieces this season, two more than any other side (Chelsea are second on nine). 69 per cent of goals scored in 2025/26, in fact, have come via set-pieces (11/16). Arteta's squad has been assembled with physicality and power purposefully to operate in such a way. But they are not the only ones.",
      "Brentford have made the long throw their party piece, scoring eight times via that method since the season began. Michael Kayode catapults the ball into the mixer and asks a team-mate to make first contact. That bit is fundamental. And then it's about who reacts quickest. At the weekend it was Dango Ouattara to spark a 3-2 victory over reigning champions Liverpool. Every side are susceptible to this type of threat if it's choreographed well enough.",
      "If only Tony Pulis' Stoke side were alive and kicking to relish in this era.",
      "Romanticists might call this evolution boring, but it's actually initiating a levelling out of the league. Bournemouth, who have used set-piece threat to good effect five times this season, are second in the table. Spurs, boasting the same success rate from dead-ball situations, are third.",
      "Frank has long been an advocate of the benefits of set-piece ability because it offers realistic marginal gains. It's a product of dedicated training ground practice. When pass-heavy football was all the rage it was less transferable because far fewer players, often costing huge sums, have the specialist talent to play that way. They were ring-fenced for the top clubs.",
      "The formula is equally true of both ends of the table. Those teams who concede from set-pieces most regularly - Nottingham Forest and West Ham, both 10 - are 18th and 19th respectively. There is little point in resisting or ignoring the shift. \"If you're not doing it, you look like a bit of a dinosaur as a coach,\" said Jamie Redknapp on Super Sunday.",
      "This new, or perhaps just elevated, manuscript is here to stay. And if you can't beat 'em, you might as well join 'em.",
      "When Manchester City were the Premier League's most potent emerging force in the early 2010s, before Pep Guardiola, managers at the very top of the game criticised City's lack of clear identity. Carlo Ancelotti, when at Chelsea, once said City had \"skill and ability\" but were \"not a team\".",
      "Not once has that ever been said of a side under Guardiola's charge - not in any part of Europe. Not at Barcelona, not at Bayern Munich and never previously at Manchester City - until now. The scars from last year's well-documented meltdown are having a lasting effect on Pep's newly-shaped squad. And it's unclear exactly what they stand for.",
      "City's most recent defeat to Aston Villa - their third of the season - was indicative of a side caught between the style change that has glorified set-pieces over pretty passing patterns. Pep has publicly professed to want to embrace what he calls \"modern football\" but a lot of the ideas go against the fibres of what made him so famously successful at every club he's managed. He was the ultimate philosophy coach.",
      "Gary Neville has been critical of this recent erosion. \"Man City aren't even good to watch any more,\" he said on this week's podcast. \"They look like they can be beat in any game of football. The play is like a hybrid between direct, old Pep in terms of passing, a bit scruffy - I'm not quite sure what it is.\"",
      "This period of flux is evidently difficult to control for a perfectionist manager. Guardiola is not going to be enlisting the long throw any time soon. City are actually the only Premier League side yet to score from a set-piece this season, which gives an indication of just how seriously, or not, Pep has welcomed these new rules of engagement.",
      "Their latest downfall was engineered by a brilliantly worked Matty Cash strike, and it came from a corner.",
      "It was City's first loss since August, and just the second time they've failed to score all season, but their repeated predictability has meant falling short far more times than is necessary to seriously challenge for the Premier League crown.",
      "Guardiola blamed \"the last action\", needing \"to shoot better or to cross better,\" but really it was a lack of ideas that cost. And if City aren't strangulating teams in possession like they once were - keeping the ball in such a methodical way that opposition sides got fed up of chasing - then what exactly are they doing?",
      "Being more direct with fast wingers is ok if you have got the physicality to cope when play breaks down and City without the lesser-seen Rodri, arguably, do not. They won just 42 per cent of ground duels at Villa Park. Not for the first time, Unai Emery got his tactical setup spot on.",
      "Back to the drawing board for Pep, then. City need a new plan B.",
      "In case you didn't hear over the weekend, and you would have to live under a rock not to, Manchester United have won three consecutive Premier League games in the same season for the first time since February 2024. Ruben Amorim is nothing if not persistent, and his will has finally been rewarded.",
      "As he himself noted in the press room at Old Trafford after making a comfortable win over Brighton look difficult, though, a sense of \"suffering\" seems to surround Man Utd before any positive outcome is reached.",
      "Only they can comprehensively beat a team while simultaneously seeming like they survived a major scare. How can a performance so assured coincide with one so fraught with nervousness? Perhaps we will never know. This seems to be Amorim's brand and for now it's working.",
      "What is clear and admirable about this version of Man Utd, which is all the more tangible when you watch from the terraces of Old Trafford, is how devoted the players are to the manager's cause. \"The players really like Amorim,\" Neville said over the weekend. \"He's authentic and honest. The players want to do well for him.\"",
      "Bruno Fernandes in a sacrificial midfield role, Amad at wing-back, and Luke Shaw's willingness to slot into a back three are all evidence of the buy-in. The stars of this latest triumph, however, were undoubtedly Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo - recruited to fit a style that is starting to show promise.",
      "While Pep's might be lost in the post, Amorim has got the modern football memo. This is not a side who are going to dazzle with intricate build-up, but can clearly sustain threat with fast, direct play that puts Cunha and Mbeumo at the heart of each attacking phase.",
      "Cunha's opener was also evidence of his maverick quality, which is helpful too. Since the start of last season no player has scored more times from outside the box than him (seven).",
      "\"We feel like we can solve anything,\" Amorim said with a smile on Saturday, later revealing he enjoyed the performance against Brighton better than beating Liverpool the week prior. \"It was more complete,\" he added. Some semblance of coherence is certainly building but Amorim was right to caveat his excitement with realism. He cannot afford to get complacent.",
      "Trips to Nottingham Forest and Tottenham in consecutive weeks will stress-test just how much progress has really been made."
