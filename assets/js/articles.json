      "On-loan Marcus Rashford isn't inclined to give much away regarding a potential permanent move to Barcelona. The Manchester United forward has been sent to Catalonia for the upcoming campaign after falling out of favour under Ruben Amorim.",
      "Rashford's temporary move to Barca gives the reigning kings of La Liga a chance to sign the player for £30million. That figure represents a fraction of Rashford's value just a couple of seasons ago prior to his stock plummeting at Old Trafford.",
      "However, there are still slight doubts regarding Barca's financial state and whether Rashford will be registered in time for the start of the season. La Liga's financial fair play laws have seen the club run into issues of late, with Dani Olmo and Pau Victor's eligibility coming into question last season.",
      "Spain star Olmo even missed playing time last term while Barcelona sought approval over their salary cap issues. But Rashford gave a laid-back response when asked about any potential pitfalls, having already made a couple of appearances for his new side in pre-season.",
      "\"I'm not worried,\" he told Catalan newspaper Sport, when asked about his registration concerns. \"It's something the club needs to resolve, and I trust they will. I'm focused on training and being ready for the start of the competition.\"",
      "Rashford then made his feelings clear on a permanent exit from United, insisting he just wants to \"enjoy the moment\" rather than think too far ahead. Rashford, 27, made his Barca debut in a 3-1 friendly win over Japanese outfit Vissel Kobe at the end of July. However, the arrival appeared to go awry as the England international came off the bench, only to be substituted off again after 30 minutes.",
      "The incident was framed as somewhat embarrassing for the player, who spent the second half of last season on loan at Aston Villa. However, new boss Hansi Flick was quick to dismiss any notions of humiliation, insisting the decision was purely to manage the player's fitness.",
      "\"We're being very careful with Marcus because he just came from an injury and he hasn't started training completely with the ball,\" said Flick after that match. \"He’s a week behind the others. He hasn’t been training as much with the ball, and we want to look after him.\"",
      "Rashford impressed on loan under Unai Emery and helped Villa make a deep run in the Champions League. He should be back among Europe's elite this coming season, though the same can't be said for parent club United after they missed out on continental qualification altogether.",
      "It's also evident Rashford is putting his new team's needs ahead of any individual goals. And he believes his ability to contribute from different parts of the pitch puts him in good stead.",
      "\"I can play in different positions and score goals from any of them,\" he said. \"It's about creating chances from different areas and taking advantage of them.\"",
      "That's the kind of attitude that may just convince Barcelona to invest in his services in a permanent capacity. However, the United academy graduate has a long road ahead to prove he's worthy of the outlay.",

      "Manchester United’s £2bn new stadium is already in doubt with Sir Jim Ratcliffe reportedly refusing to pay the asking price for land required. The Red Devils unveiled stunning plans for a new home back in March.",
      "The plans involved their current Old Trafford base being demolished and replaced with a state-of-the-art, 100,000 capacity arena. Meanwhile, the whole area surrounding the stadium would be regenerated as part of a project anticipated to cost an eye-watering £2bn.",
      "There was initially hope that the stadium - dubbed the ‘Wembley of the North’ - would be finished by 2030. But the project has already been hit with a delay, with United struggling to buy land near to the site.",
      "According to The Guardian, the Red Devils need to own a critical site beside the ground currently belonging to freight company Freightliner. United currently value the land at around £40m to £50m but Freightliner instead have an asking price of closer to £400m.",
      "The disagreement has led to an impasse, with the difference in valuation delaying the plans for the new stadium for now. Manchester mayor Andy Burnham previously confirmed that no public funding would be used in the building of the stadium itself.",
      "But the government has offered their backing to the project, including the regeneration of the local area. A statement from Chancellor of the Exchequer Rachel Reeves earlier this year read: “The Chancellor revealed today that she is championing a regeneration project around Old Trafford in Manchester that will see new housing, commercial and public space as a shining example of the bold pro-development model that will drive growth across the region, with authorities exploring setting up a mayoral development corporation body to redevelop the area.\"",
      "Unveiling the project back in March, Ratcliffe said: “Today marks the start of an incredibly exciting journey to the delivery of what will be the world’s greatest football stadium, at the centre of a regenerated Old Trafford.",
      "“Our current stadium has served us brilliantly for the past 115 years, but it has fallen behind the best arenas in world sport. By building next to the existing site, we will be able to preserve the essence of Old Trafford, while creating a truly state-of-the-art stadium that transforms the fan experience, only footsteps from our historic home.",
      "“Just as important is the opportunity for a new stadium to be the catalyst for social and economic renewal of the Old Trafford area, creating jobs and investment, not just during the construction phase, but on a lasting basis when the stadium district is complete.",
      "\"The Government has identified infrastructure investment as a strategic priority, particularly in the north of England, and we are proud to be supporting that mission with this project of national, as well as local, significance.”",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Sofyan Amrabat was decisively clear in his intention to reject Liverpool before signing for Manchester United. The midfielder, 28, was a player in demand after his impressive performances for Morocco in the 2022 World Cup as the African nation made it all the way to the semi-finals.",
      "Playing for Fiorentina at the time, among Amrabat's reported suitors were the Premier League side, then led by Jurgen Klopp, as well as the Red Devils, who were heading into their second season under Erik ten Hag.",
      "The tough-tackling midfielder looked to have been an ideal fit for the Reds, given they eventually parted ways with Jordan Henderson and Fabinho, who left Anfield for the Saudi Pro League in the summer of 2023.",
      "Having been with the Italian side since 2020, the Serie A outfit were ready to cash in on their star player, given his lofty value, with the club willing to sell Amrabat should a team meet their £25.8million (€30m) asking price.",
      "While United's number one target was to buy a new No. 9 - which they eventually did in Rasmus Hojlund - Ten Hag was said to have been targeting additional reinforcements in midfield following the £60m signing of Mason Mount, with Amrabat among his targets.",
      "The Dutchman was certainly familiar with Amrabat's game given he'd come through the academy of FC Utrecht while the current Bayer Leverkusen boss managed the Eredivisie side.",
      "The familiarity between the pair not only worked in United's favour but damaged Liverpool's transfer plans simultaneously. According to Corriere della Sera, via GFNI, Amrabat told Klopp he wouldn't be signing for him because he favoured the idea of reuniting with Ten Hag at the Theatre of Dreams.",
      "After joining on loan for the 2023/24 season, he made 30 appearances in all competitions for United. Despite failing to impress for much of his stint, he improved at the end of the season and was praised for his performance in United's FA Cup final win over Manchester City.",
      "United opted not to sign him permanently, as he then joined Jose Mourinho's Fenerbahce on loan last season before securing a permanent transfer to the Turkish giants this summer.",
      "Following his departure from the Premier League, he opened up about his exit and claimed Ten Hag wanted to keep him, but a deal could not be agreed upon for his return.",
      "Ahead of United's Europa League clash against Fenerbahce last year, he told The Mail: \"I have a special relationship with Ten Hag since I was a 20-year-old at Utrecht. He wanted to keep me this summer so I wish him the best but not for Thursday. I hope they lose.\"",

      "Arsenal opted against the signing of Benjamin Sesko in order to sign Viktor Gyokeres after deeming the RB Leipzig striker a high risk. Mikel Arteta's side finally announced the arrival of the Swede last month in what had been one of the biggest transfer sagas of the summer window.",
      "The two key striker targets for the Gunners ended up being Gyokeres and Sesko, but it was the 27-year-old who was preferred, with Sesko now at the centre of a battle between Manchester United and Newcastle United.",
      "There was a time when the Slovenian, 22, looked set for a move to north London considering the club had amassed a year's worth of background work on his progress at RB Leipzig, according to ESPN.",
      "After engaging in preliminary talks with the Bundesliga outfit, Arsenal chiefs soon found that any deal for the promising forward would be too expensive for a player who has yet to realise his full potential.",
      "The story reported that there were three main reasons for a deal for Sesko setting off \"alarm bells\" including the mammoth fee Leipzig were requesting as well as his own personal terms.",
      "Having only had two seasons in a European top-five league - where he scored 21 goals across all competitions last season - sources said the club were wary about the mental demands Sesko would have to endure of being the player leading the Arsenal attack and whether he'd be able to handle the scrutiny.",
      "While Gyokeres has yet to establish himself in one of Europe's premier domestic leagues, his stunning record of 97 goals in 102 games for Sporting CP as well as the confidence Arsenal had in the strength of his character saw them pull the trigger on a move for the striker.",
      "Sesko is reportedly yet to decide his next move, with Newcastle seeing their bid of just under £70m rejected after they turned down Liverpool's £110m offer for Alexander Isak. While Ruben Amorim's side have yet to table a formal offer for the 22-year-old, they remain intensely interested in bolstering their attacking ranks with his signature.",
      "However, Arsenal's reasons for pulling out of a deal for him could spark some concern at United, who know all about spending big money on young strikers who end up struggling to justify their price tag.",
      "The potential arrival of Sesko could spell the end of Rasmus Hojlund's Old Trafford career as Amorim admitted he remains unsure of whether the Dane - who said he wants to fight for his place - will remain a United player by the end of the month.",
      "United spent £72m on the 22-year-old and are already aware that his value has dropped significantly since joining due to his low scoring rate. They have reportedly slashed his price tag and would be willing to listen to offers for him for just £30m.",
      "Speaking after the striker scored in United's 4-1 win over Bournemouth in pre-season, the Red Devils boss said: \"I'm really happy with Rasmus, but I don't know what is going to happen until the end of the market.",
      "\"The important thing is that the strikers who are here are working really well, they are improving, they are helping the team and that's the most important thing. The important thing is that Rasmus is scoring goals.",
      "\"He's connecting really well with the team. He's improving. Again, I don't know what is going to happen until the market is closed. We suffered a a lot because of the lack of goals last season. But I think not just the goals, but the way Rasmus connects the play.",
      "\"Every time we have to kick the ball, we are kicking the ball when we are more pressed. The ability for him to hold the defender and to connect in the support is helping us to play a lot better and we are playing better because he's playing better.\"",

      "Tottenham Hotspur are eyeing up a player who almost moved to Liverpool, as they now look to replace Son Heung-Min. The legendary Spurs forward dropped the bombshell announcement on Saturday that he had made the decision to leave north London.",
      "The South Korean forward relayed his intentions on Spurs' pre-season tour of his home country and he will leave a huge hole in Spurs boss Thomas Frank's final third. The Danish boss, while disappointed at the annoucement, will now have to quickly turn his attention to bolstering his frontline, with Paris Saint-Germain's Randal Kolo Muani reportedly at the top of his list.",
      "The France international was of interest to Spurs in January, but spent the second half of last season on loan at Juventus, where he scored 10 goals in 22 appearances. He has also courted many suitors in the past, famously Liverpool and Manchester United, while Cheslea have also been linked with the star.",
      "Back in January 2023, Sky Germany claimed that Kolo Muani decided against joining Jurgen Klopp at Anfield in what would have been a rumoured £88 million deal. The striker rebuffed the Reds in favour of staying at Eintracht Frankfurt.",
      "Kolo Muani claimed he felt at ease at the Bundesliga side. However, after scoring 26 goals in just 50 games for Frankfurt, Muani was snapped up by PSG for £76.2m in September of that year.",
      "The 26-year-old could have also made his way to the Premier League via Old Trafford. A report from The Athletic stated that Kolo Muani and Rasmus Hojlund were United's top two forward targets in 2023, but the latter's age, profile and slightly cheaper price gave him the edge.",
      "After leaving both Premier League giants red-faced, Kolo Muani had a solid debut season for PSG, starting 40 times and scoring nine goals. Yet he struggled for minutes at PSG last season, scoring twice in 10 Ligue 1 appearances, and so a loan to Juve followed.",
      "He flourished in Serie A, scoring eight times in 16 games and registering one assist. His form was so impressive that Juventus are in for him again, but face stiff competition from Spurs.",
      "No offers have been lodged yet, but both teams are looking to get a deal over the line. If Spurs are the team to finally bring him to the Premier League, the Frenchman will have big shoes to fill in replacing Son.",
      "The iconic South Korean was signed from German side Bayer Leverkusen in 2015 and has gone on to score 173 goals in over 450 appearances for Spurs, eventually helping them win the Europa League last season.",
      "Speaking of his decision, Son said: \"Before we start, I just want to share the information that I have decided to leave this club this summer,\" Son said. \"Respectfully, this club is helping me to make my decision. I just want to share this before we start.",
      "\"It was the most difficult decision I have made in my career. I have spent 10 years at Tottenham. The main reason is I have achieved everything I can at Tottenham. I need a new environment for a fresh challenge. I’m grateful the club have respected my decision and wish Spurs well for the next season.\"",
      "Son refused to comment on his next destination. MLS side LAFC appear to be leading the race for his signature while there is also interest in the player from Saudi Arabia.",

      "Morgan Schneiderlin admitted his regret for ending his Manchester United career early, revealing he lost himself in his short stint at Old Trafford. The Frenchman spent seven years at Southampton and had established himself as one of the Premier League's best defensive midfielders during his time on the south coast.",
      "His impressive performances saw him sign for the Red Devils in a £24million transfer in 2015, with Louis van Gaal keen to solve his side's midfield issues. Schneiderlin started 25 league games and played in 39 matches across all competitions in his debut season but never quite met the expectations that were placed upon him.",
      "He would make only eight more appearances for the club before deciding that his time at Old Trafford was to come to an end. With Jose Mourinho replacing Van Gaal in the summer of 2016, the Frenchman was a bit-part player under the ex-Chelsea boss and requested to leave in the January transfer window of 2017.",
      "Looking back on his decision to end his Manchester adventure, Schneiderlin, whose old sides United and Everton clash in pre-season today, admitted he was too hasty to leave in order to reunite with his former Saints boss, Ronald Koeman, at Goodison Park.",
      "\"I learned a lot from my departure from Manchester United,\" the now 35-year-old told L’Equipe in 2022. \"I had played 40 matches the previous season with Manchester. When I come back from the Euros, I take ten days off and I play very little for three, four months.",
      "\"Then, I have Ronald Koeman and Everton who are pushing hard to get me, every day, from October. I will remember it all my life: I should have played against Liverpool, starter, and the coach (Mourinho) comes to see me.",
      "\"He tells me he doesn’t feel me inside the group. I tell him that indeed, with what has happened in the last three months, I am not in it and I want to go to Everton. I regretted it very quickly.",
      "\"Even if it went very well at Everton, when you play for Manchester United, when you’re at a club like that, it’s not for a moment of doubt that you have to question everything. Look at Ander Herrera: the first year I arrived, he was on the bench; he persevered, and today he is at PSG.\"",
      "While he did win the FA Cup in his debut campaign - which was the first honour of his career - Schneiderlin admitted he struggled executing Van Gaal's instructions on the pitch which left him feeling like he lost himself as a player.",
      "\"I was too affected by what Louis van Gaal was asking from me,\" he explained. \"I lost me as a player. It was not me on the field. It was not just the manager's fault; it was my fault, too. My role was not the one I had at Southampton. I felt restricted in my game. I felt they wanted to change things in me.",
      "\"I was not thinking as me, I was thinking about what pleased the coach. When you reach that point, every pass you make, everything you do, you don't play free. Something stopped me from being who I was. I wanted so much to do well, and it is one of the most frustrating things ever.\"",
      "Schneiderlin spent three years with Everton and left in 2020 to return to his native France with Nice. After departing in 2023, he enjoyed brief stints in Australia, Turkey and Greece before retiring from the sport last year.",

United are pursuing a new forward, with RB Leipzig's £70m-rated Benjamin Sesko their top target, although they face competition from Newcastle for his signature.",
      "Hojlund scored the opening goal in United's 4-1 win over Bournemouth in Chicago on Wednesday and said afterwards he is determined to stay and fight for his place next season. But if United are successful in signing Sesko or another forward, Hojlund, 22, will struggle for game time next season, particularly because Ruben Amorim's side are not in Europe next season.",
      "Hojlund could go the other way to Leipzig, as part of a player-plus-cash swap deal with Sesko, but the Denmark international is understood to not want to go to the Bundesliga club. Last season Hojlund, who joined United from Atalanta for £72m in 2023, scored 10 goals in all competitions and just four in the Premier League, underlining the need for a more prolific striker to lead their attack.",
      "United have already seen Newcastle have a bid turned down for target Sesko. The Magpies offered £65.5m and more than £4m of add-ons but the Bundesliga side will hope competition from Old Trafford can drive up the Slovenia star's value.",
      "Sesko, who scored 13 times last season, was left out of RB Leipzig's matchday squad for their friendly against Serie A side Atalanta on Saturday. The forward is under contract until 2029.",
      "United have already held talks with both player and club, and despite significant spending on the likes of Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha this summer, the club can make the signing of a forward without first selling players. But Hojlund's future could become difficult if more competition arrivs.",
      "Asked if he had received any assurances from the club about his position earlier this week, Hojlund said: “Nothing so far.",
      "“I think the most important thing for me is just to keep working hard and stay focused and then obviously we'll see what happens. I think my plan is very clear and that's for me to stay and fight for my spot, whatever happens. Competition is fine with me, it sharpens me. I'm more than ready. I'm feeling sharp, so I'm welcoming everything that comes. I think it's good with competition and it only sharpens the team.",
      "“I'm still very young. I think people forget that sometimes. I'm only 22. Obviously, not every striker is scoring 100 goals at the age of 22. But I've learned a lot, I think you can see in my game.",
      "“I'm starting to develop and become even better at the basics. Now it's just about for me to sharpen myself and I've done very well in the pre-season, so far. Just focusing on continuing that.”",

This news comes as Newcastle United table a huge £65.5million bid for the RB Leipzig striker, amidst the ongoing Alexander Isak transfer drama.",

United are progressing with a deal to sign the Slovenian international after picking him as their preferred target over Ollie Watkins, but Newcastle could put a stop to this with their bid.",
      "Sesko has not commented on the prospect of a switch to the Premier League previously, meaning he has not given any clues or indications. Given this, it could all come down to who can provide the striker with the most attractive overall package, and that doesn't simply mean financially.",
      "Basanovic discussed the possibility of Sesko making a move to England earlier this summer, stating that the striker will be looking for a range of things before deciding where to play. The agent, who met former United football director John Murtough back in 2022 to talk about a potential move to Old Trafford, said: \"It's not correct to speak about the names of clubs that are interested in Sesko, but maybe it is right to clarify a few things.",
      "\"Let me tell you: Sesko is not competing with anyone. It's him vs him every day. We have a clear plan for the future and media speculation doesn't affect us. His numbers at his age are comparable to some strikers with already great careers.",
      "\"That confirms my words. He will move from RB Leipzig only when we recognise a special club. A special project with a special coach.\"",

      "\"Bruno's putting on a bit of a clinic at the moment, he's doing some crazy stuff. Him and Casemiro are having a little laugh there, you can see they are, they seem like the best two at the moment for me, Casemiro and Bruno.\"",
      "The video clip shows Fernandes and Casemiro effortlessly exchanging passes in a rondo drill, with their skillful touches highlighted in slow motion. Ferdinand went on to praise young talent Kobbie Mainoo as well, adding: \"Actually, Kobbie. Kobbie's good as well.\"",
      "United fans will be eager for Fernandes to continue his stellar performances at Old Trafford, especially with the latest surprising transfer news from the Saudi Pro League. Despite turning down Al-Hilal earlier this year, stating his ambition to compete at the \"highest possible level\", Al-Nassr are now rumoured to be eyeing a move for the 30-year-old during this transfer window.",
      "Al-Nassr, led by Fernandes' international teammate and ex-United star Cristiano Ronaldo, could be looking to bolster their squad following the appointment of head coach Jorge Jesus.",
      "Jesus, who was handed Fernandes his Sporting CP debut in 2017, might be keen to add the midfielder to his roster of Portuguese talents, which already includes Ronaldo, Joao Felix, and Otavia.",
      "Fernandes has previously expressed contentment at United, dismissing any notion of a departure. However, the enticing financial gain on offer from the Middle East has swayed some of football's top players.",
      "Discussing his career prospects in June, the midfielder said: \"Manchester United said they didn't want to sell me.",
      "\"They said if I wanted to go I could, but they didn't need the money. I spoke to coach Ruben Amorim who, throughout that period, he was pushing for me not to go.\"",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Xavi Simons, who has been linked with a switch to Chelsea, is also absent because of what the Bundesliga club described as a minor neck injury. They did not explain the reason for Sesko's omission.",
      "That follows news of Newcastle firming up their interest in the striker amid a separate saga over the future of their current top scorer Alexander Isak. The Toon have now lodged a bid of less than £70m for Sesko.",
      "Against that backdrop, Manchester United are braced for protracted negotiations with Bundesliga club Leipzig, who are determined to stand firm on their £70m valuation.",
      "United made their first approach for the Slovenian star last week, through intermediaries, who opened up dialogue over a potential deal. Those talks have progressed and will be stepped up this week, once United have returned home from their three-game tour of the US.",
      "Although United are looking to offload several players before the summer transfer window closes, they have scope to sign a striker without selling. Marcus Rashford's season-long loan move to Barcelona cleared £12m off their annual wage bill, with the La Liga club covering his entire salary.",
      "United also raised £20.7m from sell-on clauses including Anthony Elanga’s switch to Newcastle, moves for Alvaro Fernandez and Maxi Oyedele, and the £5m paid by Chelsea to pull out of their deal to sign Jadon Sancho.",
      "In addition, United's failure to qualify for Europe this season – for only the second time in 35 years - means they are not bound by UEFA'S limit of spending no more than 70 per cent of annual income on transfers and wages.",

      "Mbeumo, who joined United from Brentford in a deal worth up to £71million, sat out victories over West Ham and Bournemouth because he was behind the rest of the squad in terms of his pre-season fitness level. But the Cameroon winger, who plundered 20 Premier League goals for Brentford last season, will feature for Ruben Amorim's side as they sign off from the US tour against Everton in Atlanta's Mercedes Benz stadium.",
      "United boss Amorim said: “He's going to play. I'm really excited to see him playing and what he can give to our team. But I was also really excited to see the team playing the last game.",
      "“You maybe looked at the starting line-up and said 'nothing to see today' but I was so excited because I know we can do better. So I'm always excited, especially at this moment.”",
      "United have added Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha to their squad this summer, at a combined cost of £133.5m and are hoping to take their summer spending through the £200m barrier with the signing of £70m-rated striker Benjamin Sesko from RB Leipzig.",
      "Although Amorim has consistently said he is happy with his current squad, the one position that needes addressing was up front, with United having managed to score a paltry 44 goals in the Premier League last season.",
      "Despite his impressive work-rate and endeavour, Rasmus Hojlund has struggled to score consistently in the past two seasons since joining from Atalanta for a grossly inflated fee of £72m.",
      "The Denmark international, who scored the opener in United's 4-1 win over Bournemouth at Chicago's Soldier Field last Wednesday, only managed four Premier League goals last season, which is why Amorim has made signing a new No.9 a priority this summer.",
      "Asked if he hoped to add to his squad before the window closes, with a new goalkeeper another position that has come under scrutiny, Amorim said: “To hope is a strong word.",
      "“But we are always looking to improve the team and we have some characteristics that we would like to have.",
      "“But again, it depends on the market. It depends on the sales. We'll see. But I'm really happy.",
      "“I think even when you talk about Andre [Onana], you can see the other goalkeepers. Even Tom [Heaton] is linear, he's a different goalkeeper.",
      "“Altay [Bayindir] did really well and Andre is going to be better like the other guys who are getting better this year.”",
      "United begin the new season at home to Arsenal on August 17 and defender Ayden Heaven, who joined from the Gunners in January, said Amorim's players have created a tight bond during their pre-season tour.",
      "“We're a really tight bunch,” said Heaven. “It gets tighter every month and we're like brothers in the changing-room. We're only going to get a tighter bond between us.",
      "“We're working really hard in training to become a better team and as you can see in our recent performances and our last game of the season as well, we've been really good. We're going to focus on the Everton game and put in another good performance.",

      "The Spanish giants have a £30m option to sign him permanently come the end of the season. Rashford has since had a slow start to life with his new club.",
      "He was substituted on and then off on his debut against Japanese side Vissel Kobe. And while that would usually be embarrassing for footballers, Barcelona boss Hansi Flick explained it was simply for fitness reasons.",
      "\"We're being very careful with Marcus because he just came from an injury and he hasn't started training completely with the ball,\" Flick confirmed, before adding: \"He’s [Rashford] a week behind the others. He hasn’t been training as much with the ball, and we want to look after him.”",
      "Rashford then made his second Barcelona appearance against FC Seoul, where he was reunited with former United star Jesse Lingard. And Barcelona have now offered an exciting update on the forward, by claiming he will be at top form sooner rather than later.",

      "Giving his verdict on his move, Rashford claimed that Flick can help him rediscover his best form. He said: “I feel very good, it was a good performance, and it was truly wonderful to play in front of the Barcelona fans, and it was beneficial for physical fitness.",
      "“I’m looking forward to the upcoming matches. We won today, but it’s important to adapt to the team, get into the playing style and deliver good football.",

      "Matheus Cunha believes a midfielder Manchester United have been urged to sign can win the Ballon d'Or. Rio Ferdinand has advised United to abandon their pursuit of Benjamin Sekso and instead go all out for Brighton's Carlos Baleba.",
      "The Red Devils have already bolstered their attack this summer with the acquisitions of Cunha from Wolves and Bryan Mbeumo from Brentford. With Rasmus Hojlund and Joshua Zirkzee eager to make their mark at Old Trafford after challenging starts, Ferdinand reckons manager Ruben Amorim is well-stocked with forwards and should turn his attention to beefing up his midfield.",
      "Should United heed Ferdinand's advice and hunt for a midfielder, he has one name in mind -21-year-old sensation Baleba, who has been turning heads at Brighton since his transfer from Lille in 2023.",
      "Baleba himself has lofty ambitions, fuelled by encouragement from Ballon d'Or winner Rodri and others, including Cunha. He revealed his aspirations to The Sun in May, saying: \"Declan Rice, Matheus Cunha, Joelinton, they've all told me I've got it in me. I want to win the Ballon d'Or like Rodri.\"",
      "On his admiration for Rodri, he said: \"I watched him [Rodri] during the Euros and before his injury I played against him and time I got the ball, he was right in front of me. It was my first game against Manchester City, and it was very difficult.",
      "\"He made it so hard to dribble or pass. That showed his class. His success has opened the door for midfielders like us to believe we can win the Ballon d'Or someday.\"",
      "Ferdinand revealed why he rates Baleba so highly on his YouTube channel, saying: \"If I don't get a striker, I'd go midfield. There's only one name I'm thinking about, I've got to be honest, who I think fits the bill for what we need.",
      "\"An Amorim-type player as well. Physically great, can drive with the ball, can take it in all areas, very good tactically, great energy, great legs, Premier League experience, centre midfield. Baleba.",
      "\"That's who I go and get. That's my man. That's the one I go and get. I go and break the bank. So if I got the money for the four players that are surplus to requirements now, would I get a number nine or would I get Baleba?",
      "\"Would I get a number nine I'm not sure about, who's a bit young, inexperienced, or would I get Baleba with Premier League experience and know what he can do here? I'm going Baleba, sorry.",
      "\"I'm going to go with Baleba. I think he'll have a huge impact on this squad, on this team. You free up a few people in that midfield area as well to have a little less responsibility defensively because I think he's all-action. He can do it all.\"",
      "The Red Devils have switched their focus to Sesko after determining he represented a more achievable target than Aston Villa's Ollie Watkins. Newcastle are also pursuing the Slovenian forward, with mixed reports emerging regarding the 22-year-old's preferred destination.",
      "Initially, it was believed that the Red Devils were Sesko's favoured choice. However, reports from his home country now indicate that he is more inclined towards a move to Newcastle, who have turned down a £110m offer from Liverpool for Alexander Isak.",

      "Much of the transfer talk around Manchester United is centred around Benjamin Sesko.",
      "The Reds are pursuing a deal for the 22-year-old RB Leipzig forward and there is a confidence that the Slovenia international could be on his way to Old Trafford. His potential arrival would almost definitely push Ruben Amorim’s summer spend beyond £200million as United attempt to rebuild after a disastrous 2024/25 campaign.",
      "Sesko would follow Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo as big-money attacking additions and the trio would form a new-look United frontline.",
      "Whether Sesko - or another centre forward - arrives or not, United have already revamped the attack with their business to date and Sunday night’s friendly with Everton could offer the first glimpse of the future should Cunha and Mbeumo play together.",
      "The duo are earmarked for the two number 10 roles in Amorim’s set-up but Mbeumo has yet to pull on a red shirt having only joined shortly before the tour of America, while Cunha missed the midweek win over Bournemouth.",
      "The Brazilian has had two outings so far and the prospect of him lining up alongside Mbeumo is a tantalising one, particularly with Amad and Bruno Fernandes having impressed at right wing back and in central midfield respectively this summer.",
      "That quartet has a creative and prolific look about it and fans could have their first glimpse into the new-look United against the Toffees.",

      "United beat West Ham United 2-1 in their opening game in New Jersey last weekend.",
      "Ruben Amorim made six changes for the win over Bournemouth, meaning he could make a similar number of alterations again in Atlanta. Below, our writers have had their say on how they would like to see United line up...",
      "As much as United fans would love to see Bryan Mbeumo from the off, it's likely he will make his first appearance in United colours from the bench.",
      "Tom Heaton deserves to start over Altay Bayindir, with Leny Yoro, Harry Maguire and Ayden Heaven making up the back three. Amad should start at right wing-back with Dorgu on the opposite side.",
      "Kobbie Mainoo and Manuel Ugarte looked excellent together in United's first pre-season tour outing and they should be given another chance in midfield.",
      "That means Bruno Fernandes can start further forward, with Matheus Cunha coming back into the team. Hojlund has enjoyed an encouraging tour of the US so far and he can lead the line.",
      "Heaton was very unfortunate to be denied a clean sheet against Bournemouth and deserves to keep his place, with Yoro, Matthijs de Ligt and Heaven starting ahead of him in defence. Both De Ligt and Heaven appeared via the bench against the Cherries.",
      "Amorim has regularly addressed the importance of managing his players' workloads, meaning he could give Dorgu a breather against the Toffees and hand a recall to Diego Leon. Amad could start in the opposite wing-back berth.",
      "Mainoo deserves a recall to the starting XI, likewise Ugarte, meaning they could join forces in the engine room. They worked particularly well as a paring against West Ham.",

Ruben Amorim's side were excellent against West Ham before the usual glut of substitutions we see in pre-season disrupted the flow of the game. A 4-1 win over Bournemouth in the following game didn't flatter United at all.",
      "United have just two more friendlies scheduled before the season begins against Arsenal in two weeks' time and so it's important they keep the momentum going against Everton.",
      "Altay Bayindir has been United's second-choice goalkeeper since his arrival from Fenerbahce, but there's a chance Amorim could make a U-turn and promote Tom Heaton to second-choice. The veteran was solid against Bournemouth and deserves to start again.",
      "Leny Yoro, Harry Maguire and Luke Shaw started against the Cherries, and it could be the same back three, although it would be wise to manage Shaw's workload and replace him with Ayden Heaven.",

      "As he grinned about the prospects of one of Manchester United's new recruits in 2016, Jose Mourinho declared that his player had the potential to become 'one of the best around'.",
      "Such glowing endorsements are uncommon from the former Chelsea and Real Madrid boss, who currently manages Fenerbahce, with his belief in the defender crystal clear. However, despite following his manager's trajectory to some extent, the star Mourinho backed for greatness failed to reach such lofty expectations.",
      "This summer, Eric Bailly finds himself without a club at 31 and is battling to secure a new team for the upcoming campaign.",
      "Mourinho captured the Europa League and Carabao Cup during his stint at Old Trafford, but departed amid acrimony before returning to England with Tottenham, then moving to Roma and now Turkey. Yet for a brief period in Manchester, Mourinho was certain he possessed a remarkable talent.",
      "\"Eric has the potential to become one of the best around,\" Mourinho declared about the Ivorian centre-half.",
      "The Reds splashed out £30million to bring Bailly from Villarreal, marking the first acquisition of the Mourinho era, following two outstanding campaigns in La Liga. He launched his United journey brilliantly, claiming the Community Shield in a 2-1 triumph over Leicester and earning man of the match honours a week later in a victory against Bournemouth.",
      "The club awarded him Player of the Month for August. He managed only 70 league outings during that period and departed two years ago as a free agent.",
      "Bailly lasted merely three months at Besiktas before his deal was cancelled. He returned to Villarreal but parted ways with the Spanish side when his contract expired last month.",
      "Whilst seeking fresh employment, he has been proposed to Serie A outfits Cagliari and Cremonese, according to Calciomercato. However, both clubs have declined the opportunity to recruit the former United defender due to his salary expectations, believed to be around £860,000 for the campaign.",
      "Recent years have represented quite the decline for Bailly, who appeared destined for greatness when he joined Mourinho at Old Trafford. Nevertheless, the duo maintain a close bond as Bailly revealed the chat he had after contacting the renowned manager following his dismissal at Tottenham.",
      "\"When he [Mourinho] was sacked from Tottenham I sent him a message and when he signed for Roma I spoke to him on the phone,\" Bailly told The Times. \"We had a few laughs. He's a coach I've always been good with. Hopefully, we'll meet in the future.\"",

      "Manchester United's plans to build a huge new stadium have reportedly stalled over issues buying the land needed to begin the ambitious project.",
      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe, the minority owner of the club, previously announced plans to build the 'Wembley of the North' as a new 100,000 seater home for the 20 time league champions. He said the project would cost at least £2 billion, and would be built on land next to United's historic home ground.",
      "Sir Jim argued that the plans, devised by Mancunian architect Lord Norman Foster and his firm Foster + Partners, would help regenerate the wider area, including creating up to 92,000 new jobs and more than 17,000 new homes.",
      "But the plans are reportedly being affected by a stand-off in negotiations for land which United hope to buy for the project. The Guardian reports that the club want to purchase land used as a rail freight terminal, which is owned by transport firm Freightliner.",
      "Never miss a story with the MEN's daily Catch Up newsletter - get it in your inbox by signing up here",
      "The paper reports that the firm is willing to relocate to St Helens, but wants £400 million for the land. Whereas United are said to value the land at between £40 million and £50 million.",
      "A source told the paper that Freightliner 'have United over a barrel', and discussions are reported to have reached stalemate. The issue could delay United's ambitious timeline to develop and open the new ground by 2030 at the earliest.",
      "The club have not yet received planning permission for the plans. Ambitious plans were set out earlier this year by Lord Foster.",
      "The new ground and surrounding development, named the Old Trafford Regeneration project, would bring an additional £7.3bn per year to the UK economy and attract an extra 1.8m visitors every year, it has been claimed.",
      "Lord Foster said the new stadium would bring fans 'closer than ever' to the pitch. Acoustically, the stadium would cultivate a 'huge roar', he said, and it would be contained by a vast umbrella which would harvest solar energy and rainwater while sheltering a new public plaza that would be twice the size of London's Trafalgar Square.",
      "The stadium would also have three masts, up to 200m tall symbolising the Red Devils' trident which would be visible from 40km away. Lord Foster claimed the new stadium could be built in as little as five years due to 'pre-fabrication', with some parts being built off site before being transported to Old Trafford.",
      "Explaining how it could be done, Lord Foster said: \"By using the network of Manchester Ship Canal, bringing it back to a new life, shipping in components - 160 of them, Meccano-like.\"",

      "After joining Barcelona on loan, Marcus Rashford remains tight-lipped about a potential permanent move from Manchester United. The forward has moved to Catalonia for the forthcoming season after falling out of favour under Ruben Amorim at Old Trafford.",
      "Rashford's temporary switch to Barca provides the reigning champions of La Liga an opportunity to secure his services for £30million. This sum is significantly less than Rashford's value just a few seasons ago, before his standing took a hit at Old Trafford. The Spanish side are also covering his salary, saving United in the region of £12million over the course of the year.",
      "However, there are uncertainties surrounding Barcelona's financial health and whether Rashford will be registered in time for the season's kick-off. La Liga's financial fair play regulations have recently caused problems for the club, with the eligibility of Dani Olmo and Pau Victor being questioned last season.",
      "Spanish star Olmo even missed some game time last season while Barcelona sought approval over their salary cap issues. Yet when asked about any potential stumbling blocks, having already made a couple of pre-season appearances for his new team, Rashford responded nonchalantly.",
      "\"I'm not worried,\" he told Catalan newspaper Sport (via The Mirror), addressing his registration concerns. \"It's something the club needs to resolve, and I trust they will. I'm focused on training and being ready for the start of the competition.\"",
      "Rashford then clarified his stance on a permanent departure from United, emphasising he simply wants to \"enjoy the moment\" rather than think too far ahead. The 27-year-old made his Barcelona bow in a 3-1 friendly triumph against Japanese side Vissel Kobe at the end of July.",
      "Yet the cameo seemed to go awry. The England star entered as a substitute, only to be hauled off again after 30 minutes. The episode was portrayed as rather awkward for the player, who spent the latter half of last season on loan at Aston Villa.",
      "Nevertheless, new manager Hansi Flick was swift to reject any suggestions of embarrassment or shame. And he maintained the choice was purely to manage the player's fitness levels.",
      "\"We're being very careful with Marcus because he just came from an injury and he hasn't started training completely with the ball,\" said the German after that match. \"He's a week behind the others. He hasn't been training as much with the ball, and we want to look after him.\"",
      "Rashford excelled on loan under Unai Emery and assisted Villa in making a historic run in the Champions League. He should be back among Europe's elite this coming season, though the same cannot be said for parent club United after they missed out on continental qualification altogether.",
      "It's also clear Rashford is prioritising his new team's requirements ahead of any personal ambitions. And he believes his capability to contribute from various areas of the pitch puts him in good stead.",
      "\"I can play in different positions and score goals from any of them,\" he said. \"It's about creating chances from different areas and taking advantage of them.\"",
      "Such an approach could well persuade Barcelona to secure his services on a permanent basis. Nevertheless, the United academy graduate faces a considerable journey to demonstrate that he merits the move, having copped criticism from pundits and United icons alike for not 'deserving' the transfer to Spain.",

      "If Manchester United's fortunes are going to change during Ruben Amorim's first season in charge of the club, a big indicator will be the form of Patrick Dorgu in his first full campaign.",
      "Amorim has been wedded to his 3-4-2-1 formation that brought him great success at Sporting CP but there have been teething issues when implementing it at Old Trafford.",
      "United chiefs have full faith in the Portuguese's methods and the thinking is that while United suffered short term pain last season - their 15th place finish was their worst ever Premier League campaign - the long term benefit of players getting to grips with Amorim's methods will be worth it in the long run.",
      "Amorim, of course, places huge importance on wing-backs and it was telling that his first signing in the January transfer window was Dorgu.",
      "Manchester United have launched their new away kit for the 2025/26 season, inspired by the club's early-1990s Adidas snowflake kit.",
      "United paid Italian side Lecce £30million to prise him from Serie A and despite United's struggles last term, there were some positive signs from the 20-year-old.",
      "And the Dane has made a strong start to pre-season, too, scoring in the 4-1 win over Bournemouth on United's tour of the USA.",
      "\"I feel like the pre-season is helping everyone to understand Ruben's ideas even more,\" Dorgu told club media after that win over the Cherries.",
      "\"The more training we have, the more we will grow into his ideas and I feel like it is being seen a little bit on the pitch already. We just keep improving.",
      "\"Every game is a chance to improve and be ready for Arsenal. Every game is important and we will just take it game by game.\"",
      "While pre-season is never the most reliable barometer to gauge a team's form, United have looked much better than they did last term.",
      "The players look like they understand Amorim's ideas more clearly and the arrivals of Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo have given the whole club a lift.",
      "Whether Dorgu succeeds or fails at United this season will reflect hugely on how Amorim is viewed, given he was his first signing and is so important to the success of his much maligned system.",
      "The signs have been positive in the summer and Amorim will hope that continues into the Premier League later this month. If it does, with United not challenging on the European front next season, it could send a warning to their top flight rivals.",

      "The reaction from a Manchester United staff member was one of near incredulity at Patrick Dorgu's performance in Chicago.",
      "\"Proficient\" was the word the suit used to describe Dorgu's start at the club. Dorgu, a left back by trade, is developing into a pure winger on the evidence of pre-season.",
      "Those selected for the wide roles in United's 3-4-2-1 system are routinely referred to as \"wing-backs\" when they have to be viewed as wingers. They are picked to service the striker. Dorgu did just that for Rasmus Hojlund's first goal against Bournemouth.",
      "\"We have a very good relationship,\" Hojlund said in the Soldier Field mixed zone. \"There's only one year between us and we have a lot of common friends. We come from the same sort of area in Denmark as well and we're really starting to bond.\"",
      "Dorgu also got on the scoresheet for the first time in United colours. The 20-year-old is more attack-minded and more intense than he was during his sheepish first few months, admittedly in a team that literally could not string two Premier League wins together.",
      "\"I feel like I play the same way,\" Dorgu opined. \"I just came in at a difficult moment and I think the team is improving a lot through the pre-season. I think it's more like a collective than an individual.",
      "\"I feel like we need to attack more and I feel like me and Amad did well today to be attacking and always be a threat in behind.\"",
      "Ruben Amorim struggled to find the right balance with the United team in his first six months. He often picked eight defensive players, hardly in keeping with the club's ethos.",
      "The indecision was apparent in the days leading up to the Europa League final when Bruno Fernandes was suddenly moved back to midfield to accommodate Mason Mount, a decision that hammered the final nail in Alejandro Garnacho's coffin.",
      "Now the defenders are going on the attack. In the absence of Lisandro Martinez, Leny Yoro is embracing the line-breaking role from centre back, spraying the odd pass from his own third into the opponent's.",
      "Fernandes was urgent in central midfield against Bournemouth, Dorgu was more of an attacker than a defender and Hojlund was ably supported by Amad and Mason Mount. It is a better balance.",
      "United have not put on a full open training session, as they have done on previous tours, due to the sheer amount of tactical work Amorim has presided over. Club media's lenses have not even been permitted entry for those sensitive segments. The players are playing as if they are being coached to within an inch of their lives.",
      "Jose Mourinho privately observed that Amorim's system revolves around \"providing depth to the striker\". United are more direct and pinging more forward passes towards Hojlund, not as isolated in possession.",
      "\"I'm not going to say every training session, but he (Amorim) makes sure that you go prepared for every game,\" Diogo Dalot said. \"We go to every game already knowing what's going to happen, more or less, with the opposition.",
      "\"Obviously, it can happen that they might change something, but the basics of every team, we try to go to every game prepared. We always do the walk-throughs and some tactical work, of course. He's very keen on that so we can be prepared.",
      "\"But at the same time, the message is really clear. There's not too much information, so everybody knows two or three things they need to do during the game.",
      "\"Once we get used to that, I think we will reach a point, hopefully, where we can almost play with our eyes closed. We already know where everybody is going to be on the pitch.\"",
      "Amorim personally oversees the tactical walk-throughs. Unlike the dogmatic Louis van Gaal, who infamously admonished a player if he took a shot without first controlling the ball, Amorim trusts the players to make their own decisions in a match environment. His assistant, Carlos Fernandes, continues to take charge of set pieces and certain drills.",
      "The United head coach has settled on a softer form of discipline than Erik ten Hag. Players have breakfast in the Waldorf Astoria from 7.30am and have to be on the coach to training at the Endeavor Health Performance Center by 9.15. There is gym work before the players head onto the grass at 10.30. Amorim usually hits the gym for an hour from 7am each morning.",
      "Ten Hag's dim view of tardy timekeeping caused congestion on the stairwell in United's Bangkok hotel during his first tour in 2022. The lifts in the Athenee hotel were so slow that players sometimes trekked up 40 flights of stairs to make meals on time.",
      "United have performed enterprisingly in their two tour games in New Jersey and Chicago. Their chance-conversion rate in the latter against Bournemouth was most unlike them: four goals from six attempts on target. Most pleasingly for Amorim, United won without either of their £133.5million signings in the squad at Soldier Field.",
      "The team look in sync after a chastening six months getting to grips with Amorim's formation. He has identified the most suitable position for certain players, such as placing Harry Maguire or Matthijs de Ligt in the middle of the back three. A minor adjustment but one that has emboldened Yoro and, to a lesser extent, Ayden Heaven on the left.",
      "Casemiro and Manuel Ugarte have not started together, so the outfield is not overloaded with defensive-minded starters. United were initially rigid in the 3-4-2-1 and now look fluid, with Amad and Kobbie Mainoo seamlessly shifting between different roles in the two tour games.",
      "\"More than the results, it's the way they are playing,\" Amorim replied when asked if there was a difference about United. \"I think it's really important. People cannot see that. I think they are playing better also because they are connecting better with each other. Not just on the pitch, but off the pitch.",
      "\"I think they are stronger, they are faster. In this moment, of course, it's a pre-season. But you can see the intensity is completely different. I can see the data from the minutes are completely different.",
      "\"So we are improving. But again, it's a pre-season game. The pressure is going to be so much different during the season. It's important for them to understand that the same players can play a different game. I think today was a good day.\"",
      "What we can see is this is the fittest United have looked on tour for several years. There was gallows humour in the press box that Matheus Cunha, who spent more time walking than any other outfield player in the Premier League last season, sat out the Bournemouth win due to fatigue. Amorim warned the players at the start of his tenure that they would have to \"run like dogs\".",
      "\"I think we will hopefully see a United team that is attacking more, that's on the front foot,\" Dorgu added, \"that's trying to dominate games, every game. We just take the rest of the pre-season to get even better.",
      "\"I feel like we're getting there, we're playing more as a team, we're running for each other, we just need to fight to win games, we need everyone to play 100 per cent and that's what we're trying to do.",
      "\"You can see it on the pitch that we're playing [as] a more active team. With the press, we run more for each other, so you can see that the pre-season has helped everyone.\"",
      "Mount revealed at the start of the tour that players were kicking each other more in training to up the intensity. The keep-ball activities at the start of sessions are usually lighthearted looseners. Fernandes was borderline overzealous on Tuesday, flying into Cunha.",
      "Well-placed sources have noticed how pleased the players are that Fernandes has stayed. Amorim quickly came to lean on him last season and his influence is so profound that Amorim regards Fernandes as the Mourinho to his Bobby Robson.",
      "Fernandes and Harry Maguire are the two players who spend the most time with the football staff. Fernandes joined club employees at the W Hotel bar on the post-season tour in Kuala Lumpur.",
      "The last time the majority of United's starters played for more than an hour in an opening tour game was in 2018 in Phoenix when Mourinho had to pick a shadow squad a week after the World Cup concluded. Lee Grant was his most senior available goalkeeper and Antonio Valencia, the captain, lasted a half against Club America. Nine days later, Mourinho accused Valencia of enjoying \"too much holiday\" in the close season.",
      "The current United players were all given an individual programme for the close season. Sources say much of it was a specific running drill that the players were tasked with replicating regularly back at the club's Carrington training complex, not dissimilar to a bleep test. The sports scientists have been impressed with the results, proof the players treated the programmes seriously, and the feeling is it has allowed United to hit the ground running in pre-season.",
      "Amorim has eschewed double sessions that have been commonplace on past United tours. From one o'clock onwards, the players are free to do as they please, with a midnight curfew set for them and staff.",
      "United have been based at the Chicago Fire's immaculate training complex that opened this year. United favour a base for their pre-season schedule and the delayed flight to New Jersey for the West Ham match was a minor matter owed to the stormy weather.",
      "Crucially, Amorim ensured United did not schlep across to San Diego to play at the Snapdragon Stadium to keep the sponsors sweet. That would have meant United heading west, where the time zone difference is eight hours as opposed to six in Chicago.",
      "Staff felt the schedule for the 2023 tour - New Jersey, San Diego, in and out of Houston and Las Vegas - affected United's form at the start of a sulphurous season. United seem to be the only football club that has to reiterate that football comes first but on this tour it has.",
      "They have been better than proficient.",

      "Manchester United have a battle on their hands to sign RB Leipzig striker Benjamin Sesko.",
      "The problem United have is that Newcastle are also in the running to snap-up Sesko this summer. Various reports have claimed that the Magpies have made an opening bid worth €80million (£70million) including add-ons.",
      "United are still understood to be in the running to sign Sesko, with the striker's decision to be confirmed. If United were to agree a deal for the RB Leipzig star, they would have the perfect welcome gift on offer.",
      "As is often the case when United confirm a new signing, they are soon given a squad number that they will wear during their time at Old Trafford. Matheus Cunha was awarded the No.10 shirt after his arrival from Wolves - while Bryan Mbeumo will wear the No.19 shirt following his move from Brentford.",
      "Sesko currently wears the No.30 shirt for RB Leipzig - as has been the case since his arrival in 2023. However, that number is currently occupied by summer signing Diego Leon, so will not be available to Sesko.",
      "However, another number from Sesko's past is available for him, or other new players, at United. The striker wore the No.29 shirt when he was with Red Bull Salzburg's academy set-up, and has also been available at United since Aaron Wan-Bissaka's move to West Ham last year.",
      "Sesko has previously worn the No.21 shirt earlier in his career, but that number is currently occupied by Antony - amid uncertainty over his future. It's possible, though, that No.21 becomes available to new signings with Antony being inked-in for an exit from Old Trafford this summer.",

      "\"I'm sorry to sound like a broken record, I'm aware of what is happening - but I am not dealing with it,\" Howe said via ChronicleLive. \"I woke up today and had two training sessions then came straight here.",
      "\"I'm finding out what is happening after it has happened, so we will try to bring the best to the football club, I will make that clear, but I can't talk about individual targets.\"",

      "With just two pre-season friendlies remaining, Manchester United head coach Ruben Amorim's focus will soon switch to his side's Premier League opener against Arsenal at Old Trafford.",
      "United will welcome the Gunners to Old Trafford on August 17 for their season curtain-raiser with the ambition of putting last season's struggles firmly behind them.",
      "Three games into their pre-season campaign, United have produced plenty to be positive about. The opening two games of their tour of the United States have produced two wins, six goals and two very encouraging performances.",
      "With Everton still to come in Atlanta on Sunday and Fiorentina visiting Old Trafford next Saturday, Amorim will be hoping to see two more uplifting showings from his players, who have bought into his plans so far this summer.",
      "But what could United's strongest matchday squad look like for their season opener against the Gunners in just over a fortnight's time?",
      "If he recovers from his hamstring injury in time, Andre Onana is likely to reclaim the gloves and start between the posts. He has not featured in pre-season after getting injured in the first week of training and it remains to be seen if he will be fit in time for the clash with Arsenal.",
      "United have plans to bring in a new goalkeeper ahead of the transfer window closing, but the chances of them recruiting a big-name starting goalkeeper would rest on them offloading Onana. It is understood they don't currently have any plans to sell him.",
      "Amorim has plenty of options to choose from at centre-back, meaning that area of the team could cause him the biggest selection headache. Leny Yoro should be a guaranteed starter after two excellent performances in the US so far, and he should occupy the right-sided centre-back berth.",
      "Matthijs de Ligt and Harry Maguire are jockeying to start in the middle of the back-three. Ayden Heaven is a strong contender to start on the left, but will face competition from Luke Shaw and eventually Lisandro Martinez.",
      "Although Bryan Mbeumo is yet to make his first appearance in United colours, he is highly likely to walk straight into Amorim's first-choice starting XI after scoring 20 Premier League goals for Brentford last term. His starting position will have a direct impact on Amad.",
      "Proven he is more than capable as a right wing-back in Amorim's system, Amad is the logical choice to occupy that role for the season opener. Patrick Dorgu, who was excellent in the recent wins over West Ham United and Bournemouth, is a shoo-in on the opposite flank.",
      "Bruno Fernandes will be one of the very first names on the teamsheet, meaning he is a guaranteed starter in midfield, but there is an ongoing debate about who should start next to him. Kobbie Mainoo and Manuel Ugarte are currently the leading contenders to start alongside Fernandes.",
      "Accounting for Arsenal's attacking quality, Ugarte is a more suitable partner for Fernandes amid his defensive capabilities. A midfield duo of Mainoo and Fernandes could leave United exposed.",
      "With Amad a logical choice at right wing-back, Mbeumo should start as the right-sided No.10. Matheus Cunha, who missed the win over Bournemouth due to fatigue, is the obvious pick at left-sided No.10.",
      "As things stand, Rasmus Hojlund, who has enjoyed a solid pre-season so far, is the leading candidate to spearhead United's attack for the season opener. However, the club hope to sign RB Leipzig striker Benjamin Sesko to become the new face of their forward line.",
      "The Reds face competition for Sesko from Newcastle United. If lured to Old Trafford, he will expect to be thrown straight in.",
      "As far as the substitutes are concerned, United are light on midfielders and strikers, meaning the bench risks having a defensive look to it. Tom Heaton has been more commanding that Altay Bayindir this summer, meaning he deserves to be promoted to second spot in the pecking order.",
      "Defensive cover can be provided by the likes of Diogo Dalot, Noussair Mazraoui, Maguire and Shaw. Diego Leon, however, will be hoping to creep into Amorim's thoughts.",
      "Mainoo is an obvious pick if he misses out on the starting XI. Mason Mount, who is more comfortable as a No.10, is also an option.",
      "Joshua Zirkzee and Hojlund can provide attacking over. However, Chido Obi will be hoping to become a regular fixture in the matchday squad this season.",
      "Starting XI: Onana; Yoro, De Ligt, Heaven; Amad, Ugarte, Fernandes, Dorgu; Mbeumo, Cunha; Sesko.",
      "Substitutes: Heaton, Dalot, Mazraoui, Maguire, Shaw, Mainoo, Mount, Zirkzee, Hojlund.",

      "The Red Devils have made the signings of Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Diego Leon this summer but they want to bring in more players before the deadline.",
      "Reports have indicated that INEOS want to bring in another striker, defensive midfielder and goalkeeper before the transfer window shuts in less than a month.",
      "RB Leipzig striker Benjamin Sesko has emerged as the top centre-forward target at Old Trafford with Man Utd looking to move players on in order to bring in new signings.",
      "The Man Utd ‘bomb squad’ of Jadon Sancho, Antony, Alejandro Garnacho and Tyrell Malacia all need to be moved on after Marcus Rashford was the first major departure a couple of weeks ago.",
      "Hojlund is one player who the Red Devils are willing to let go for the right price this summer with BBC Sport claiming that Man Utd ‘are prepared to sell’ the Denmark international for £30m.",
      "READ: Twenty most valuable footballers in the world: Yamal, Mbappe rank high as Arsenal duo included",
      "The striker ‘would be marginalised’ if Sesko arrived but Hojlund insisted earlier this week that his “plan” is to “fight” for his spot in the team in the upcoming season.",
      "Hojlund said: “The most important [thing] for me is to keep working hard and stay focused and then we’ll see what happens. My plan is very clear and that is for me to stay and fight for my spot.”",
      "After rumours that Hojlund could be used as a makeweight in a deal for Sesko, talkSPORT insist that the Dane has told Man Utd ‘he does not want to move to RB Leipzig’.",
      "Hojlund only scored four Premier League goals last term as Man Utd finished as the fifth lowest goalscorers in the division but former Blackburn Rovers and Chelsea striker Chris Sutton doesn’t think he got enough service.",
      "Sutton told BBC Sport: “Have United been providing him with the chances and the opportunities? The answer to that is no.",
      "“But also, you have to consider whether he has done well enough. Has he ever been a prolific goalscorer? That would be the nagging doubt and is something I have debated with United fans.",
      "“It is not to say he doesn’t have time on his side, and his attitude is good too.”",
      "And former Liverpool striker Stan Collymore reckons Hojlund would be a good fit for Aston Villa this summer if they looked to sign another striker.",
      "Collymore told Caught Offside in June: “Aston Villa could afford the transfer fee and wages.",
      "“Man United will be looking to recoup money from him, and that could involve loaning him back to several clubs in Italy. But by doing this, he would never be settled. He’s still a very young man.",
      "“I really like him as a striker, I think he’s got the basic attributes. But he went to Manchester United and it’s basically completely shattered his confidence. Rasmus Hojlund, as a young man in his early 20s, is aching for somebody to put their arm around him.",
      "“This is the bit of the development process that you should have had. He should have gone to someone like Aston Villa first, scored you 25 goals and then gone to Manchester United two or three years down the line.”",
      "Man Utd have told RB Leipzig their ‘formal bid’ for Sesko is ready but Amorim is clashing with INEOS over the Red Devils’ striker plans this summer.",
      "According to reports, Manchester United have decided to perform a ‘U-turn’ on the ‘crazy’ sale of one Red Devils star, who is ‘happy’ to remain at the club.",
      "Rasmus Hojlund arrived before INEOS’ partial takeover of Manchester United and the new decision-makers are said to be dubious about the striker.",
      "Man Utd fans may have to settle for another year of Rasmus Hojlund up top after Ruben Amorim suggested he was happy with the Dane leading the line.",
      "Manchester United have received a blow in their desire to offload Antony, though there is fresh interest in another expensive flop, according to reports.",

      "Transfer expert Fabrizio Romano has revealed that Man Utd are now “ready to bid” as soon as Benjamin Sesko “decides to join them”.",
      "The Red Devils have have already made three signings this summer with Mathueus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo arriving from Premier League clubs Wolves and Brentford respectively, while Paraguayan youngster Diego Leon has joined from Cerro Porteno.",
      "Widespread reports indicate that Man Utd are looking to sign three more players before the end of the transfer window with Ruben Amorim wanting a striker, a midfielder and a goalkeeper.",
      "Man Utd look to have settled on RB Leipzig’s Sesko as their top centre-forward target after reported interest in Aston Villa’s Ollie Watkins.",
      "However, the Red Devils face serious competition from Newcastle for Sesko with Newcastle having a bid worth €80m rejected by RB Leipzig on Saturday.",

      "READ: Twenty most valuable footballers in the world: Yamal, Mbappe rank high as Arsenal duo included",
      "Jacobs wrote on X: ‘Leipzig have rejected Newcastle’s €75m+€5m bid for Benjamin Sesko. €75m fixed fee met their quoted valuation, but overall package not deemed acceptable in terms of both total and structure.",
      "‘Leipzig not yet dropping their demands from when Arsenal were working on the transfer before Viktor Gyökeres. Manchester United yet to bid, but remain in the race having held club-to-club and player talks. Leipzig hoping, and some sources say waiting, for an #MUFC offer to create competitive tension.",
      "‘Sesko has still not, as of Saturday afternoon, indicated to either club which one he prefers to join despite reports from Slovenia he has already picked Newcastle. Prior to Newcastle’s bid, there were some fears within the club that Sesko was holding out for Manchester United.’",
      "And now Romano has claimed that it’s a “very open” race between Man Utd and Newcastle with the Red Devils waiting on a green light from Sesko before bidding.",
      "Romano said on his YouTube channel: “Newcastle have sent a bid and there is an ongoing negotiation with Red Bull Leipzig.",

      "Man Utd are also hoping to sign a defensive midfielder, a striker and a goalkeeper before the transfer window shuts in just under a month’s time.",

      "One player who looked likely to be heading for a departure earlier this year was Fernandes with Al-Hilal making a big push to sign the Portugal international from Man Utd.",
      "It is understood that the Saudi Pro League club offered €120m to the Red Devils, while Fernandes was proposed a deal that would see him earn €70m a year.",
      "READ: Twenty most valuable footballers in the world: Yamal, Mbappe rank high as Arsenal duo included",
      "But now Portuguese newspaper A Bola claims that Al-Nassr boss Jorge Jesus ‘wants’ to unite Man Utd midfielder Fernandes with Portuguese team-mates Ronaldo and Joao Felix in Saudi Arabia.",
      "It is understood that ‘money won’t be a problem’ and that ‘having Jorge Jesus in charge and Cristiano Ronaldo leading the squad would be enough to help convince the Red Devils midfielder’ to make a transfer U-turn.",
      "A Bola adds: ‘Possible contact has already taken place in the last few hours between two of the three parties: it is natural, at this stage, that the first approach is between the player and the club interested in signing him and also interested in knowing whether any advances with Old Trafforf could make sense.",
      "‘After securing João Félix, in a lightning operation that ended up stealing the winger from Benfica, JJ and CR7’s Al Nassr are now looking to secure another key player for the National Team and, in this particular case, for Manchester United, led by Ruben Amorim, who will certainly do everything to keep Bruno Fernandes.’",
      "However, it would seem unlikely that Fernandes would cave in to a move to Saudi Arabia after making it clear that he wants to remain “at the highest level”.",
      "Explaining his decision to reject Al-Hilal a couple of months ago, Fernandes said: “There was an opportunity.",
      "“The [Al-Hilal] president called me and asked if I wanted to go there. They were waiting for me. I spoke to coach [Ruben] Amorim. He asked me not to go.",
      "“Manchester United didn’t want to sell me. They don’t need the money. If I had wanted to leave, they would have made it happen.”",
      "Fernandes added: “It was an easy move, even at a family level.",
      "“I had João Cancelo there, my children are used to playing with him in the national team. We have a great friendship.",
      "“But I want to maintain myself at the highest level, playing in the big competitions and I feel capable of it.”",
      "People paid to write about Manchester United are acting like Bruno Fernandes in central midfield is a ‘tactical tweak’. Keep up…",
      "Some have scoffed at Man Utd for chasing soon-to-be-30 Ollie Watkins. But they have good form for signing veteran goalscorers…",
      "Premier League teams other than Man Utd have been adept at selling players this summer. Chelsea are the masters thanks to the absurdity of Joao Felix.",
      "Saudi Pro League side Al-Nassr have reportedly made an ‘offer’ to Man Utd for Antony as Cristiano Ronaldo’s team ‘continue to explore Europe’.",
      "Liverpool will hope Alexander Isak can become one of the finest signings made by a Premier League champion, but Manchester United will take some budging.",
      "According to reports, Cristiano Ronaldo wants Al-Nassr to buy a Liverpool star as he has ‘requested’ a ‘crazy signing’ for this window."

      "19) Marc Guehi – Crystal Palace to Liverpool\nFootball Insider’s Mick Brown is hearing things again, folks. Guehi to Liverpool could accelerate following Luis Diaz’s transfer to Bayern, apparently.

      "18) Alejandro Garnacho – Manchester United to Aston Villa \nUnited are said to have spoken to Chelsea and Villa in an effort to lump Garnacho in as part of a deal to sign a striker. Chelsea’s valuations of Garnacho and Nicolas Jackson are miles apart, but there could be some common ground with Villa. For the purposes of PSR, they would need to be separate transactions, but Villa are in a stronger position than United given they know Garnacho has got to go somewhere before the deadline, whereas they would be quite content to keep Watkins. Regardless, there is a deal to be done here.",
      "",
      "17) Gianluigi Donnarumma – PSG to Manchester United\nDonnarumma has been in a contract dispute with PSG but we’re starting to think there might be more to this than his representatives using United’s name and the oldest trick in agent’s book. PSG are signing Lucas Chevalier from Lille and appear more likely to sell Donnarumma now than allow him to leave for nothing next year. United certainly need a goalkeeper, but they also need a striker and neither can be paid for with brass buttons. Still, one to watch…",
      "",
      "16) 🆕 Arnaud Kalimuendo – Rennes to Brentford\nAfter scoring 17 goals in 33 Ligue 1 games last season, Kalimuendo is a wanted man. AC Milan are keen but Brentford have reportedly ‘made contact’. This link shows a willingness to sell Yoane Wissa, which is great news for Newcastle.",
      "",
      "15) Dominic Calvert-Lewin – Everton to Aston Villa\nCalvert-Lewin left Everton at the end of last season and Villa reportedly see the ex-England striker as a cheap way to bolster their attacking options. Newcastle and AC Milan are thinking along similar lines but Villa currently appear to be favourites.",
      "",
      "14) 🔽 Ollie Watkins – Aston Villa to Manchester United\nThis one picked up again after reports that United are to choose between Watkins and Benjamin Sesko. Of course, we’d expect Villa might want a say in that. And, if asked, they’d say they want £60million. United, apparently, reckon they can get Villa down to around £45million. But they thought they could haggle with Brentford and ended up paying more for Bryan Mbeumo. Watkins might find himself as United’s preferred option just because they could offer Garnacho to Villa.",
      "",
      "13) James McAtee – Manchester City to Nottingham Forest \nForest are said to have had a bid rejected for the England Under-21 star, whose minutes at City are threatened by Rayan Cherki’s arrival. McAtee has interest from Eintracht Frankfurt and Borussia Dortmund, while Palace are keen too. But Forest aren’t far off with their £25million bid. We suspect this will come down to the player’s preference: stay in the Premier League, or a gap season or two in Europe?",
      "",
      "12) 🔼 Darwin Nunez – Liverpool to Saudi\nJuventus have been linked more than any other European club in recent weeks, but a transfer to the Middle East seems much more likely. It just depends on whether Nunez is up for it or not. Liverpool will pray he is.",

      "",
      "10) Benjamin Sesko – RB Leipzig to Manchester United\nOn Wednesday morning, we were told that Watkins was the priority; by Wednesday evening, it’s Sesko. As always, it seems United are fighting themselves, with some lobbying for Watkins, while head of recruitment Christopher Vivell is pushing for the player he’s credited with signing for RB Leipzig six years ago. Has anyone asked Ruben Amorim? Either way, players are “scared” to join Newcastle and not a team that just finished 15th in the Premier League. United’s boost is Newcastle’s blow. Until it isn’t. United are now behind their league rivals in the race for Sesko.",
      "F365 SAYS: Manchester United brief over striker shortlist and transfer ‘process’ makes them look foolish yet again",
      "",
      "9) Jadon Sancho – Manchester United to Juventus\nIt was reported ages ago that agreements had been reached between the clubs and the player, but still we wait. The reason, we suspect, is Juve stalling for time. They do need to sell, but they also know there is no other market for Sancho, If they sit tight, United will grow more desperate, as might the player, and better terms will almost certainly become available. Indeed, United’s price has come down again to between £15million and £17million (so, £16million?) and Sancho’s agent was in Turin last week in a vain attempt to speed things along.",
      "",
      "8) Yoane Wissa – Brentford to Newcastle\nNewcastle are having a ‘mare of a summer, but some rare good news came in the form of Wissa’s desire to move to St James’ Park. However, and quite reasonably, we’ll add, Brentford are intent on keeping the forward having already lost their manager, captain and best player this summer. If Newcastle really want Wissa, they’ll have to pay over £40m for a player who was reportedly told last summer that he could leave for £26m at the end of 2024/25, prompting him to go on strike. With Brentford due back in London from their pre-season camp, we can expect some clarity here soon. The Bees have shown they are no pushover but Wissa isn’t f***ing around either.",

Full-backs Jeremie Frimpong and Milos Kerkez have joined for £29.5m and £40m respectively, and we have also added the £25m on Giorgi Mamardashvili as that transfer will be counted in this summer’s accounts."

      "The Premier League kicks off in two weeks. Some clubs are ready; others are miles off it. We’re ranking all 20 by how catastrophically screwed they are – from the ones cruising to the one contemplating its very existence.",
      "",
      "20) Liverpool\nNot f**ked in the slightest. The reigning champions have strengthened beyond belief in the summer transfer window, smashing their transfer record for 22-year-old attacking midfielder Florian Wirtz, replacing Trent Alexander-Arnold with Jeremie Frimpong, improving at left-back by signing Milos Kerkez, adding one of the Bundesliga’s best players in Hugo Ekitike, and likely signing Alexander Isak from Newcastle United.",
      "Even without Isak, Liverpool are ridiculously strong. Adding him would just take the p*ss quite frankly.",
      "Their ambitious summer transfer window has been enabled by the club’s shrewd transfer business in recent seasons. Before the 2025 summer window opened, they were tenth in the five-year Premier League net spend table. They’re currently seventh and buying Isak wouldn’t take them into the top four unless Arsenal sell Bukayo Saka for £200million before then.",
      "Arne Slot won the title after signing one player for 2024/25; Federico Chiesa started four times across all competitions and will leave after just one year at Anfield. You can’t blame the club’s hierarchy for not backing the manager heavily last summer, and having gathered the strongest evidence possible, they know they have an elite title-winning head coach and spending big on players he wants makes absolute sense. The Reds have played it to perfection.",
      "Manchester United should be taking notes after giving Erik ten Hag hundreds of millions in his first transfer window, and going all in on players for Ruben Amorim’s system, knowing that if it goes tits up, they’ll likely appoint a manager who doesn’t want half of the playing squad…again.",
      "TL;DR: Liverpool won the league comfortably and have strengthened like no champion has before. They are title favourites and signed all of their pre-planned transfer targets weeks before the Premier League season kicks off.",
      "MORE: Liverpool keep or sell: Eight Reds sold as Nunez, Elliott help fund record Isak transfer",
      "",
      "19) Chelsea\nThese guys are set…for the next five years. They can and should relax a bit, but we all know they won’t. They must fuel their transfer addiction. Chelsea have always been erratic and ambitious in the transfer window, but things have been cranked up a notch in the Clearlake era.",
      "Joao Pedro and Liam Delap are excellent striker additions, Jamie Gittens is a questionable one for £50m, but we’re not writing him off, Andrey Santos is Like A New Signing, and Estevao is a genuine wonderkid. We like this Chelsea squad and their title credentials.",
      "",
      "18) Arsenal\nNow that a striker is through the door, it has to be said that Arsenal are only an elite left-winger away from having the perfect squad. And that signing is more desirable than required, with Gabriel Martinelli, Leandro Trossard and Noni Madueke capable options on that side for now.",
      "Signing Viktor Gyokeres was the big one for the Gunners, with Martin Zubimendi’s addition in midfield also significant. It’s always been about the need for an out-and-out centre-forward, though. The big Swede made his debut against Spurs in Hong Kong on Thursday, but could not prevent a 1-0 defeat that we are not looking into too much, even if Mikel Arteta’s side were toothless in attack and many of the same issues from last season were on display. Not looking into it, though.",
      "All in all, the club’s transfer activity has been uncharacteristically ruthless, but still well planned out and meticulous. They took their time weighing up their options before picking Gyokeres over Benjamin Sesko, for instance.",
      "If this isn’t Arsenal’s year, then it’s never happening under Arteta, whether it’s in the Premier League or Champions League. Although Arsenal are where they are because of the Spaniard, it does feel like do or die for him. After so much money spent and five years of his #process, this club needs something tangible to show for their improvement, and it might take a proven winner in the dugout for that to happen.",
      "",
      "17) Manchester City\nPep Guardiola got the majority of his transfer business done early this summer due to the club’s involvement in the Club World Cup. Tijjani Reijnders, Rayan Ait-Nouri and Rayan Cherki were all through the door in time to play in the United States, and Norwegian wonderkid Sverre Nypan and goalkeeper James Trafford have since signed.",
      "They are all set for another season under Guardiola and you wouldn’t put it past them steamrolling to the title, even if the two clubs who finished above them last term have improved.",
      "Rodri is back, but Kevin De Bruyne is gone, so it’s not easy to predict how City’s year will pan out.",
      "One potential issue is the lack of a right-back signing. Matheus Nunes can’t be the long-term option in that position. Then again, Guardiola is probably planning to make natural centre-back Abdukodir Khusanov the best right-back in the league, and there’s nothing anyone will be able to do about it.",
      "",
      "16) Brighton and Hove Albion\nFor me, Clive, Brighton had to get a new centre-back in early doors, and they did just that with Diego Coppola, who was among Europe’s top aerial duel winners last season.",
      "For good measure, they added Olivier Boscagli from PSV on a free transfer. He could end up being the bargain of the summer. Let’s not look past Maxim De Kuyper as well. He’s why Pervis Estupinan left without a fuss.",
      "They might have lost Joao Pedro, but £30m wonderkid Charalampos Kostoulas and Stefanos Tzimas have joined. Brighton won’t just be fine, they’ll be looking at the clubs above them who are stumbling through this transfer window, thinking there’s an opportunity.",
      "",
      "15) Manchester United\nSo, United look pretty decent. Their pre-season performances have been promising, and Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha are two excellent additions.",
      "This is a huge summer for the club, with Ruben Amorim’s players needing to adapt to his 3-4-2-1 system after over half a season of being unable to do so. This break – and reset – was needed.",
      "The Red Devils could obviously add more players to up the expectations even more, but we think the only position they *need* to improve is centre-forward.",
      "",
      "14) Sunderland\nWe’re big fans of the business conducted by newly-promoted Sunderland. Granit Xhaka, in particular, is a ridiculously good signing. He’s a Champions League midfielder, for crying out loud.",
      "The Black Cats have been ambitious, but so were Burnley, Ipswich and Luton Town over the last two seasons. It’s going to be tough, but this team is becoming well-equipped to survive.",
      "",
      "13) Nottingham Forest\nAfter signing a striker, replacing Anthony Elanga was Forest’s top priority, and they’ve done so excellently with the addition of Switzerland international Dan Ndoye.",
      "For Forest, keeping their best players was the most important thing, though bulking up the squad is necessary after Nuno Espirito Santo’s men ran out of steam in their Champions League pursuit last term. They successfully scared off Spurs and extended Morgan Gibbs-White’s contract, and haven’t been forced to deal with any serious interest in Murillo, Callum Hudson-Odoi or Elliot Anderson.",
      "Last season exceeded every Forest fan’s expectations, but we’re predicting another fun year, especially with a European campaign to look forward to. The City Ground under the lights on Thursday nights will be special.",
      "",
      "12) Tottenham Hotspur\nMohammed Kudus improves an area of the pitch Spurs needed to improve, and some of their depth issues were addressed in January, so the Europa League holders don’t need to do too much.",
      "Another midfielder is needed, and there are reports of Joao Palhinha coming in. He’d add something different to an energetic midfield, but after missing out on Gibbs-White, we wouldn’t be surprised to see Thomas Frank go for Harvey Elliott, or someone similar.",
      "And on Frank, that’s a top appointment. Getting the managerial situation sorted quickly was vitally important and Daniel Levy did exactly that.",
      "",
      "11) Leeds United\nQuestion marks over Daniel Farke’s future were squashed before Leeds’ transfer business started, and their business has been impressive for the most part. Anton Stach is the standout signing, while Lucas Perri and Jaka Bijol are savvy additions for a newly-promoted side.",
      "It will be a long season for the Elland Road faithful, but there are ten clubs, six of which they’d fancy pulling into a relegation battle, who are in a worse position going into it.",
      "",
      "10) Burnley\nBurnley haven’t necessarily found themselves in a position where they are, per se, f**ked, but they’re hardly filling us with confidence. Kyle Walker is past it but remains a solid addition; we rate the Marcus Edwards deal, and think Sam Johnstone would be a good replacement for James Trafford.",
      "Whatever happens between now and the start of the season, just know that Scott Parker isn’t making it to Christmas. We don’t make the rules.",
      "",
      "9) Fulham\nMarco Silva’s only summer signing so far is back-up goalkeeper Benjamin Lecomte. Not ideal, that. But maybe the Portuguese head coach is happy with his squad. Keeping Rodrigo Muniz seems to be Fulham’s top priority right now, but there’s a definite need for a new wide forward. Raheem Sterling has been mooted and we think it’s a great fit for the player and club; he wouldn’t even need to move house.",
      "This club needs a deep cup run or European push, and they’re going to need to get moving if either is to become a realistic objective.",
      "",
      "8) West Ham\nGraham Potter surely hoped for more of a rebuild at West Ham this summer. So far he’s lost Kudus, been forced to sign Jean-Clair Todibo permanently, added Kyle Walker-Peters on a free, and signed young wing-back El Hadji Malick Diouf for £19m.",
      "This is a team lacking top quality and athleticism in forward areas. There’s only so much Jarrod Bowen can do.",
      "One big positive is that Lucas Paqueta no longer has a potential ban hanging over his head, having been cleared of spot-fixing charges. Hopefully for the Irons, this will relieve pressure, tension and be a huge weight off the Brazilian’s shoulders, and they’ll enjoy watching him back to his best. There is talk of him leaving for as little as £25m, though, which might be off the table following the result of his case with the FA.",
      "",
      "7) Crystal Palace\nThe Eagles’ pre-season preparation has been heavily impacted by the ongoing uncertainty surrounding their first-ever European campaign. It’s contributed to the club only making two signings – back-up goalkeeper Walter Benitez for nothing and left-back Borna Sosa for £2m.",
      "Oliver Glasner knows there has to be more transfer activity: “Even though all the players are still here, we haven’t made the most of the transfer window so far. I was promised that we would be more active and bring in the new players earlier this year. As of now, I have 17 outfield players. I hope we don’t lose any more. If that happens and we get four new ones on deadline day like last year, another false start is possible.”",
      "Openly discussing a broken promise with the board is an ominous sign. Of course, the board’s focus is elsewhere, but Glasner’s concentration is fully on getting his team prepared for the season, and that preparation isn’t going to plan. Yes, he’s still got Jean-Philippe Mateta, Eberechi Eze and Marc Guehi – but for how long? Palace have reportedly turned down £30m from Atlanta United for Mateta, Arsenal are expected to sign Eze, and Guehi is a Liverpool target in the last year of his contract.",
      "Another key figure in their final 12 months is Glasner. The club are in discussions, but it’s hard to envision the Austrian head coach agreeing terms if those promises aren’t fulfilled. Palace going down isn’t realistic, but they are threatening to start 2025/26 very slowly. With a Thursday-Sunday schedule to contend with, they might not get up and running fast enough to make this upcoming campaign half as memorable as the last one.",
      "",
      "6) Bournemouth\nThis is not based entirely on losing 4-1 to Manchester United in pre-season, though we couldn’t be blamed if it was.",
      "We don’t think they’re in relegation trouble, but Bournemouth’s defence has been ripped apart, and they’ve only signed a left-back to replace Milos Kerkez. Dean Huijsen still hasn’t been replaced and Illia Zabarnyi is a top Paris Saint-Germain target. For months, we’ve been saying that the Cherries need a right-back with Adam Smith past his best and Julian Araujo struggling, but now that’s the least of their worries.",
      "Andoni Iraola has, at least, secured the signing of a new goalkeeper after being unable to make Kepa Arrizabalaga’s loan permanent. Djordje Petrovic is an excellent signing and arguably better than Chelsea’s first-choice goalkeeper, Robert Sanchez.",
      "Bournemouth are relaxed. Having made £90m alone from Huijsen and Kerkez, they’re under no pressure to sell Zabarnyi, but the Ukrainian wants to join PSG. He hasn’t stayed at home or gone to train at his old club to force the move, though. Fair play.",
      "The fact of the matter is, they aren’t close to signing a centre-back after failing to sign Lille’s Bafode Diakite, and they need two of them. It’s also been suggested that they want to sign a striker on loan with Enes Unal injured until November.",
      "There’s still plenty to do, but Bournemouth have extended Antoine Semenyo’s contract and are expected to keep hold of him, Evanilson and Justin Kluivert.",
      "",
      "5) Wolves\nThere is a serious threat of relegation looming at Molineux, and the fact that fans are furious over Nelson Semedo’s departure says a lot about the state the club is in. No offence, Nelson.",
      "There’s a concerning lack of quality throughout Vitor Pereira’s squad, and the man who carried Wolves through most of last season, Matheus Cunha, is long gone. Replaced by Fluminense’s Jhon Arias, Wolves should have plenty of money left over, having made over £60m from the Brazilian’s sale.",
      "Jorgen Strand Larsen joining permanently is a boost, and Arias could be as exciting and influential as Cunha, but this is another transfer window that the Midlands club are failing to take advantage of.",
      "It’s easier said than done to just replace Cunha with someone as good. Unfortunately, that’s not realistic, unless head coach Pereira can bring the absolute most out of someone unexpectedly. We just can’t see it, and the lack of invention in midfield, attack and full-back spells trouble. Oh, and they need a goalkeeper.",
      "Also, we can’t explain why, but Pereira stinks of an acrimonious November exit. We look forward to it.",
      "",
      "4) Everton\nDavid Moyes expected more from Everton’s summer transfer window, and he’s not a happy bunny. He’s being left short all over the pitch, with his side struggling in pre-season, drawing against Accrington Stanley and losing to Blackburn Rovers and Bournemouth.",
      "“The truth is we’re not getting them over the line at the moment – that’s a fact,” a frustrated Moyes said to reporters in the United States. “We’re not getting a lot of the deals done which we’re hoping to do, so we’re continually reassessing and moving on, while maybe things are not coming to fruition… We’re desperate to get things moving on because we know time’s running out.”",
      "Everton enjoyed themselves (for once) in the second half of last season and had reason for optimism in 2025/26, especially as they’re moving into a new stadium. With two weeks to go until they open their season with a trip to Leeds United, Moyes needs a winger, midfielder, right-back and centre-back. Not much, then.",
      "",
      "3) Aston Villa\nOne of the clubs most restricted by the Premier League’s Profit and Sustainability rules, Villa have been worryingly inactive in the summer transfer window.",
      "The addition of Yasin Ozcan is their only signing for a fee, and only Fulham (£437k) and Crystal Palace (£2m) have spent less. There have been some striker rumours involving Samu Aghehowa and Lois Openda, but most of the club’s transfer stories are about sales, not signings.",
      "One sale could be Ollie Watkins, and there’s also a possibility that Morgan Rogers leaves, while Leon Bailey, Jacob Ramsey and Emiliano Martinez have been linked with exits.",
      "The position the Villans are in is very surprising. This time last year, they were looking forward to a Champions League campaign after unsettling the status quo with a fourth-place finish in the Premier League. Now, they are worried about being dismantled while their rivals strengthen at pace and they remain shackled.",
      "The need for attacking reinforcements was underlined by the loan signings of Marco Asensio and Marcus Rashford and the permanent arrival of Donyell Malen from Borussia Dortmund in January. Asensio and Rashford were only on loan and contributed to 29.3% of Villa’s goals scored between February and the end of the season. They also had seven assists. Malen should have a bigger role next season after being cast aside following Rashford’s arrival, being left out of Unai Emery’s squad for the Champions League knockout rounds.",
      "Losing over a quarter of your goals must be addressed, and Villa’s lack of signings emphasises the need for a big sale. Rogers would be a gut-wrenching departure, but you have to break eggs to make an omelette. Getting clarity on players like Rogers, Watkins and Martinez is imperative, and it’s clear that Emery needs reinforcements all over the pitch.",
      "The one positive is that Boubacar Kamara has signed a new five-year contract. Positive Villa fans will tell you that’s more significant than any signing they make this summer.",
      "",
      "2) Brentford\nKeith Andrews’ Brentford are firmly in ‘We fear for them’ territory. The loss of Thomas Frank is gargantuan, and replacing him with a rookie head coach is extremely risky. Then you have the exits of club captain Christian Norgaard and star player Bryan Mbeumo, which was inevitable but still stings, and the Yoane Wissa debacle.",
      "Wissa reportedly feels betrayed by the club, who promised him a £26m transfer this summer if he stayed for 2024/25. He did, yet he’s not been allowed to join Newcastle following Mbeumo’s move to Manchester United.",
      "Too many key figures have departed for Brentford fans to be anything but sceptical of their survival chances this season. Relegation has not been a threat since their promotion in 2021, but with no Frank, Norgaard, Mbeumo and Wissa, it’s looking rather bleak.",
      "",
      "1) Newcastle United\nShambolic doesn’t begin to cover whatever is going on at Newcastle this summer. It’s baffling, disgraceful, and everything in between. Some things are out of their hands, but there’s no decisiveness in their transfer pursuits, which has seen several targets slip through their grasp like a lubed-up mini egg.",
      "The Magpies have botched pursuits of Joao Pedro, James Trafford, Hugo Ekitike, Liam Delap and could miss out on Benjamin Sesko because he’s “scared” he’ll be blocked from a future move. Losing out on the RB Leipzig striker to Manchester United will be the final straw for some fans.",
      "After winning the Carabao Cup and qualifying for the Champions League, this was supposed to be a monumental summer for the club. Instead, it’s been a monumental disaster. And we haven’t even got into the Alexander Isak ordeal yet…",
      "There’s not much they can do, but the black and white wounds are already well-salted. The biggest question is: why now, Alex? The timing is baffling and the spotlight is on a club in disarray.",
      "Villa might be in a bit of bother, but we fear for Eddie Howe and his players in their first Premier League game of the season away to Emery’s side.",

Nine-figure sums are simply what’s required for world-class central midfielders these days.",

      "",

      "15) Jack Grealish (Aston Villa to Manchester City, £100m): £127m\nA key part of City’s treble-winning team in 2022/2023, but it is odd for him to be City’s club-record signing.",
      "",
      "14) Faustino Asprilla (Parma to Newcastle, £6.7m): £127m\nAsprilla would probably be labelled a flop as a result of 18 goals and 19 assists in 63 appearances had he been signed for such a high fee in the last five to ten years. Thank goodness we were gifted Apsrilla before the joy was sucked out of football.",

Burnley away\nThis one comes with a ‘dynamic tonal graphic, designed using real soundwave patterns’ captured from recording crowd noise at Turf Moor, which is precisely the sort of sentence designed to make our teeth itch, but we’re willing to overlook it on this occasion because the result is very lovely indeed.",
      "While we do consider ourselves members of the ‘away kit colours are a free-for-all’ tribe in that particular war, that doesn’t mean we aren’t as partial as the next kit obsessive to the beguiling simplicity of simply inverting the colours of the home kit.",

We don’t hate metallic or neon detailing on a black shirt, but there’s something to be said for leaning into the monochrome simplicity, and Nike have done that beautifully here.",
      "The square ‘SPURS’ pattern in the fabric gives just the right amount of detail to hit the sweet spot where you get a nice, clean, unfussy top but avoid the ‘just a black T-shirt’ pitfall.",

The light blue pinstripes pop beautifully between the stripes/panels/whatever, and the elegance with which the umbro mark and Bournemouth badge sit within the two blue stripes is just very lovely indeed.",
      "And while we’re on the subject: just look at that badge. We are suckers for a club crest re-rendered in the appropriate colourway for an away kit and this is just an absolutely fabulous example of it. More excellent use here of that lighter blue that really pulls the whole kit together.",

The vibrant yellow and navy is a classic Tottenham change kit colourway, the Total 90 template remains sensational even if we do find the very idea that anything from a year beginning with a ‘2’ might now be considered fair game for raking in the retro-nostalgia coin slightly uncomfortable.",
      "We already wake up every morning with at least three new aches and pains; we really didn’t need any further reminders of our own march to decrepitude and the freewheeling passing of time.",
      "Where were we? Yeah. Cracking kit. Lovely old Spurs badge from the before times when we could put socks on standing up. But look where they’ve put that badge. It’s in the middle, isn’t it? Where it shouldn’t be, and with the Nike swoosh all the way out on the breast.",
      "We’ve said it before and we’ll say it again: if you must deploy a central club crest, you simply must also centralise the maker’s mark. It’s a basic question of balance. This example of this unacceptably frequent misstep upsets more than most, given the otherwise 10/10 shirt they’ve decided to slightly spoil for simply no good reason.",

      "We like this one a lot, especially for the clever use of the ‘snowflake’ imprint. It’s a motif whose association with United goes all the way back to that belting early ’90s away kit, and a design adidas have since leant on for United with even more enthusiasm than they have Arsenal and the lightning bolt. They even did it last season and have gone back to the well again.",
      "But if it works, it works. And what they’ve done for United here that maybe isn’t quite so true of the (nevertheless strikingly excellent) Arsenal away kit is do something new and different with it. In this case that means making it all massive.",

      "It is so, so much better than last year’s away kit when, instead of drawing inspiration from a beloved Arsenal kit from the past a rare yet gigantic mis-step from the Germans saw them instead influenced by a bottle of Lynx Africa.",
      "The only minor grumble one could reasonably have here is the similarity to a third kit Arsenal had a few years ago, and thus the fact that this shirt could be argued to represent the running out of ideas, with adidas leaning on the lightning bolt motif yet again on yet another retro-inspired Arsenal shirt.",
      "To this we say: Yeah, whatever, just look at it. It is lovely. And that’s the real quiz.",
      "Another thing in this shirt’s favour is that we vastly prefer the simple cannon logo to Arsenal’s full shield badge. We know why they don’t, but we strongly feel they should always just have the cannon. It is better."

      "Newcastle have made a bid worth roughly £70m for RB Leipzig's Benjamin Sesko while Manchester United are also keen; Slovenia international has impressed in Germany and drawn style and stature comparisons with Manchester City's Erling Haaland",
      "Saturday 2 August 2025 14:19, UK",
      "Newcastle, Manchester United and Arsenal have all shown an interest in signing Benjamin Sesko this summer - but what makes the RB Leipzig striker so appealing?",
      "Arsenal's interest is over after they opted to sign Viktor Gyokeres from Sporting CP but Newcastle have bid £70m and Manchester United are also considering a move.",
      "Sesko has scored 39 goals in 87 games for RB Leipzig since joining from Red Bull Salzburg two years ago but what qualities would the 22-year-old bring to the Premier League?",
      "And could he really be the next Erling Haaland?",
      "His scoring record is modest by comparison but Sesko is a rare breed of striker with a similar physical profile to Haaland. At 6ft 4in, he is exactly the same height and similarly quick.",
      "His stature allows him to play the role of a targetman, holding the ball up, bringing team-mates into play and providing an outlet for long passes, crosses and set-piece deliveries.",
      "Like Haaland, he combines those qualities with explosive pace.",
      "Last season in the Bundesliga, Sesko's top speed of 35.69 km/h put him 26th among 492 players to feature in the competition. He ranked even higher in the previous campaign, at 15th.",
      "His pace no doubt forms a significant part of his appeal to Newcastle as they face the prospect of having to replace Alexander Isak, and to Manchester United as they look to add more explosiveness to their attack following the signing of Bryan Mbeumo from Brentford.",
      "Sesko's speed can stretch and destabilise defences. It is also a devastating weapon on the break and on transitions, something he has demonstrated throughout his time in Germany.",
      "RB Leipzig are known as one of the country's most effective counter-attacking teams - their total of 17 counter-attack goals since the start of last season is the second-highest among Bundesliga sides, behind only Eintracht Frankfurt - and Sesko has been a big part of it.",
      "His total of five fast-break goals across the last two Bundesliga seasons puts him third in the division, behind his RB Leipzig team-mate Lois Openda and former Eintracht Frankfurt forward Omar Marmoush, who have scored six each.",
      "Sesko's most recent example came during a 3-3 draw with Bayern Munich in May, when he accelerated away from Eric Dier to latch onto a Xavi Simons pass and send a superb, first-time finish past stranded goalkeeper Jonas Urbig from long range.",
      "That attack saw the ball travel from the edge of RB Leipzig's box to the back of the Bayern Munich net in a matter of seconds and it was enabled by the speed and ruthless efficiency of Sesko.",
      "It is also worth noting that it is not just in open spaces that Sesko is able to carry the ball upfield.",
      "Unusually for a player of his stature, Sesko is also an accomplished dribbler with the technical skill to beat defenders in tight spaces before accelerating towards goal.",
      "His average of 1.46 successful take-ons per 90 minutes was in fact the highest of any out-and-out striker in the Bundesliga last season, highlighting another area of strength.",
      "Sesko's scoring rate dipped slightly as RB Leipzig endured a poor campaign last term but his penchant for the spectacular remains, thanks largely to his outstanding ball-striking ability.",
      "That opening goal against Bayern Munich in May, curled around Urbig using the outside of his boot from 40 yards out, was one of four he has scored from outside the box in the Bundesliga since the start of last season. Only a handful of players have scored more.",
      "Even fewer can claim to have found the net from distance with the same level of ferocity.",
      "Sesko is able to generate astonishing power with his shots, as seen most memorably with his stunning strike against Werder Bremen in January, rifled into the top corner from 25 yards out. The ball was later revealed to have travelled at a speed of 126.43 km/h.",
      "That goal against Werder Bremen, like the one against Bayern five months later, was hit with his stronger right foot but he can muster similar power using his weaker foot too.",
      "Playing for Slovenia in a Nations League game against Sweden in September 2022, he scored a sensational, left-footed volley which drew comparisons with Marco van Basten.",
      "Sesko's willingness to shoot from improbable angles and unlikely positions can, on the flip side, be frustrating. His shot map for the last two Bundesliga seasons shows a high percentage of his shots were statistically unlikely to result in goals.",
      "It is also worth noting he has significantly overperformed relative to his expected goals at RB Leipzig, scoring 27 times in the Bundesliga from only 17.7 xG across the last two seasons. The numbers raise questions over whether his scoring rate is sustainable.",
      "At the same time, though, knowing what he is capable of, it is easy to see the logic behind his ambitious shot choices. Sesko has shown he can score from just about anywhere. His directness is another part of his appeal.",
      "Another of Sesko's biggest attributes is his prodigious leap.",
      "He was a promising basketball player in his teens and the agility honed on the court can now be seen in the way he challenges for headers and controls high balls on the pitch.",
      "Coupled with his height, it gives him an edge in the opposition box, as seen when he leapt above the outstretched hand of Eintracht Frankfurt goalkeeper Kevin Trapp to head home a rebound before Trapp could reach it during a 2-1 win in December.",
      "That goal was one of eight Sesko has scored with his head across the last two Bundesliga seasons. It is the fourth-highest total in the competition behind Harry Kane, Serhou Guirassy and Tim Kleindienst, and underlines the extent of his aerial threat.",
      "That threat is particularly pertinent to Manchester United as they aim to increase their set-piece threat. They rank as the Premier League's lowest scorers from set-pieces over the last three seasons.",
      "Sesko is not yet the finished article having only turned 22 at the end of May. Some elements of his game are still raw. His goals tend to come in bursts rather than consistently.",
      "A move to the Premier League would come with considerable pressure and high expectations but his age ensures he has plenty of room to grow and develop.",
      "There is of course an element of risk in signing Sesko ahead of a more established option. He does not boast the same prolific scoring record as Haaland when he made the move to England. Haaland had scored 86 goals in 89 games for Borussia Dortmund whereas Sesko has scored 39 goals in 87 games for RB Leipzig.",
      "But his potential is huge and the parallels in style are clear. The pair have even followed similar routes, with Sesko effectively brought in as Haaland's replacement at former club Red Bull Salzburg.",
      "It is also worth noting that, at only 22, Sesko has already amassed considerable experience, making more than 250 appearances for club and country, featuring at Champions League level, and reaching double figures for goals in five consecutive campaigns.",
      "He has done all that while avoiding any serious injury setbacks. That durability is another factor in his favour, and another source of encouragement to Newcastle and Manchester United.",

      "Thursday 31 July 2025 15:41, UK",
      "Ruben Amorim says Manchester United \"look like a different team\" after they earned their second victory in the Premier League Summer Series.",
      "United followed up their 2-1 win over West Ham by beating Bournemouth 4-1 on Thursday morning, even without new signings Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha.",
      "There are indications that the same players who struggled last season in the Premier League are now more comfortable in Amorim's shape.",
      "\"It was a good game. We played with intensity. We were aggressive and that is something that we need to improve from last season,\" said Amorim. \"We had better possession compared to the last game, so they are listening.",
      "\"Of course, scoring first in the beginning of the games can change the confidence of the team. We changed some positions and you feel that they know what to do in different positions.",
      "\"It was a good test. We controlled quite well the runs of Evanilson and Semenyo one against one. Luke Shaw was also really strong. So it was a good day.",
      "\"It was just a pre-season game but the feeling with the same players, even being a pre-season game, if you look at the same players now playing, it looks like a different team and that is a good sign.\"",
      "Amorim also indicated that United's improvement has come from a better culture as the club looks to offload Alejandro Garnacho, Jadon Sancho, Antony and Tyrell Malacia, having sent Marcus Rashford on loan to Barcelona.",
      "Amorim said: \"More than the results is the way they are playing. They are playing better also because they are connecting better with each other, not just on the pitch, but off the pitch.",
      "\"They are stronger. They are faster in this moment. Of course, it's pre-season, but you can see the intensity is completely different. I can see that the data from the minutes are completely different.",
      "\"We are improving, but again, it's a pre-season game. The pressure is going to be so much different during the season, but it's important for them to understand that the same players can play a different game.\"",
      "Rasmus Hojlund opened the scoring for Man Utd amid the club's move for RB Leipzig striker Benjamin Sesko.",
      "Amorim believes United have improved because of the improvement in Hojlund's performances.",
      "\"People focus on the goals and we suffer a lot because of the lack of goals,\" said Amorim. \"I think not just the goals, but the way he connects the play every time we have to kick the ball [long]. The ability for him to hold the defender and to connect in support is helping us a lot to play better and we are playing better because he's playing better.",
      "\"I'm really happy with Rasmus. I don't know what is going to happen until the end of the market. The important thing is that the strikers that are here are working really well, are improving, are helping the team and that is the most important thing.\"",
      "Bournemouth head coach Andoni Iraola was also full of praise for United.",
      "\"We are very far right now from United,\" he said. \"They are a hell of a team. They have signed very well and today they showed they are above us in this moment.\"",
      "Amorim had insisted all along that perhaps the changes that he wanted to make at Old Trafford would be easier to implement during a summer and there were encouraging signs in Chicago that the worst of his time at United could now be behind him.",
      "There were plenty of positives in this performance against Bournemouth that went deeper than the result. In difficult conditions, United moved the ball impressively and played with real intensity and no little cohesion. In other words, it was different.",
      "There were interchanges between Bruno Fernandes and Mason Mount, the latter adding weight to the theory that Amorim's system will suit him in the long term. Patrick Dorgu, having shown himself to be a useful outlet last season, suggested he can build on that promise.",
      "This is pre-season and there are dangers in reading too much into it - particularly given that new signings Cunha and Mbeumo did not feature. But perhaps that is also a good sign. The same players looked a lot better. Light at the end of a long tunnel for Amorim.",

      "Newcastle United are also interested in the player, but it is thought, as it stands, Manchester United is Sesko's preferred destination.",
      "The interest in Sesko is being driven by recruitment director Christopher Vivell - he is widely credited for scouting Sesko for Red Bull Salzburg when he was 16.",
      "United's interest in Sesko is long-standing, having kept an eye on his development for a number of years.",
      "While the focus is clearly on player sales, United have done due diligence on a number of strikers in this window.",
      "Talks have been held with Aston Villa over Ollie Watkins, while there was also a tentative interest in Chelsea's Nicolas Jackson.",
      "However, the prices and structure for those players have been deemed too high at this stage.",
      "While Sesko would cost more than Watkins overall, it's thought a more favourable structure could be struck with Leipzig.",

      "Sesko has scored 39 goals in 87 games for RB Leipzig since joining from Red Bull Salzburg two years ago, but what qualities would he bring to Old Trafford? And could he really be the next Erling Haaland?",
      "His scoring record is modest by comparison but Sesko is a rare breed of striker with a similar physical profile to Haaland. At 6ft 4in, he is exactly the same height and similarly quick.",
      "His stature allows him to play the role of a targetman, holding the ball up, bringing team-mates into play and providing an outlet for long passes, crosses and set-piece deliveries.",
      "Like Haaland, he combines those qualities with explosive pace.",
      "Last season in the Bundesliga, Sesko's top speed of 35.69 km/h put him 26th among 492 players to feature in the competition. He ranked even higher in the previous campaign, at 15th.",
      "By targeting Sesko, Manchester United are continuing a theme of trying to add pace to their attack this summer having already signed Bryan Mbeumo, who recorded a top speed of 36.63 km/h last term, making him the fourth-fastest player in the Premier League.",

      "Manchester United defender Luke Shaw has suggested there are no longer any \"stragglers\" in the squad as a result of Ruben Amorim's tough approach.",
      "The new season provides fresh opportunity for United to avenge what Amorim himself labelled a disaster season as United recorded a record low Premier League finish of 15th, while also suffering defeat to Tottenham in the Europa League final in May.",
      "Defeat in the final meant United finished the season empty-handed and now prepare for just their second season without European football in 35 years.",
      "Despite the 1-0 defeat in Bilbao, Shaw was quick to defend manager Amorim after the game, explaining that the Portuguese is the right man to lead the club forward. Asked to further explain his comments during United's training camp in Chicago, Shaw doubled down on his stance.",
      "\"I think his mentality, his demands [show he's the right man],\" Shaw said.",
      "\"He's extremely tough on the group. He leaves no stone unturned and I think there are no stragglers in this group anymore. I think everyone has to put the team first. He's made that very clear.",
      "\"I think he's picking players on how he feels will be best for the team and that's his choice. As players, we're fully behind him and fully behind on his ideas and what he wants to implement in this team. We feel like a real team, especially this pre-season.",
      "\"Since I've been back, the group is so together and I think that's something that we need to keep to make us more of a family and everyone all together and we're all driving in the same direction.\"",
      "While there were some lows for Shaw both personally and United as a team, Shaw believes the spirit in pre-season should spur them on to lofty ambitions like winning the Premier League.",
      "\"I can't be any worse than it was last season,\" Shaw said.",
      "\"I was so low last season, so I think anything but that. I feel good and I think especially this pre-season.",
      "\"Obviously, I didn't have a pre-season last season either, so I think it's really benefiting me to be able to just be fit and train with the team and get minutes.",
      "\"I'm enjoying that. Aims-wise, I think the aim has to be winning the Premier League.",

      "\"Even the manager, I'm sure he probably wouldn't say it in the press, but we all have to have the same beliefs and ambitions. Like I said, that real family feeling together, and we all strive for the same thing.\"",

      "After Rashford's departure, United continue to work on exits for Sancho, Antony and Malacia - as well as Garnacho.",
      "Manchester United are focusing on sales, but work continues behind the scenes around the potential recruitment of a striker.",
      "United have been in the market for a striker regardless of Rasmus Hojlund's future amid interest in him from Italy.",
      "Work has been done to explore potential deals for Aston Villa's Ollie Watkins and RB Leipzig's Benjamin Sesko.",
      "Nicolas Jackson is another player the club have looked at, but Chelsea's valuation of the striker is understood to be considered far too high.",
      "United have approached Villa about Watkins, who they have a long-standing interest in.",
      "However, Villa do not want to sell and he is thought to carry a value of around £60m.",
      "The interest in Sesko is understood to be driven by recruitment director Christopher Vivell, who signed the striker as a 16-year-old for Red Bull Salzburg.",

      "\"They look more like Manchester United's style of players, with a bit more pace and power, and that physicality to get from box to box.",
      "\"The other thing I like about those two is they've not proved themselves at the highest level in the game so they should be really desperate to prove themselves on a huge stage, which is Old Trafford.",
      "\"That hunger hasn't always been there in the last 10 years with players that have come to the club.",

      "Match report as Ruben Amorim's team recorded their first win of pre-season at the Summer Series in the US; Man Utd raced into a two-goal lead courtesy of a Bruno Fernandes double; Jarrod Bowen pulled one back for sloppy West Ham",
      "Sunday 27 July 2025 11:44, UK",
      "Bruno Fernandes scored twice as Manchester United grabbed their first win of pre-season with a 2-1 victory over West Ham in the Summer Series.",
      "The game was played at the MetLife Stadium in New Jersey - where, in just under a year, the World Cup final will be held - and the two underachievers from last season played out a friendly with a competitive feel.",
      "Man Utd starting XI: Bayindir, Yoro, De Ligt, Heaven, Amad, Mainoo, Ugarte, Dorgu, Fernandes, Cunha, Hojlund.\n\n\nMan Utd XI after 65 minutes: Bayindir, Shaw, Fredericson, Maguire, Leon, Dalot, Fletcher, Casemiro, Collyer, Mount, Obi",
      "United put in a first-half performance that Ruben Amorim described as \"completely different from last season\", when speaking to MUTV.",
      "His side hit the post through Rasmus Hojlund inside two minutes but didn't have to wait long for the opener from the penalty spot after Alphonse Areola fumbled a cross and then fouled Ayden Heaven inside the area. That allowed Fernandes to slot home from 12 yards.",
      "West Ham really struggled to play through the Manchester United press with Patrick Dorgu and Hojlund doing some excellent work out of possession, although Hojlund's finishing again let him down on 18 minutes when dragging a shot wide.",
      "West Ham starting XI: Areola; Wan-Bissaka, Todibo, Kilman, Aguerd; Diouf, Guido Rodriguez, Ward-Prowse, Soucek, Bowen, Fullkrug",
      "It was left to Fernandes again to find the quality to make a difference as he doubled the lead just after the break. Again, it was a high press from United that did the damage - this time Kobbie Mainoo taking advantage of a slack Areola pass which allowed Fernandes the opportunity to curl one home from 20 yards in typically assured fashion.",
      "Amorim waited until 65 minutes to completely change his starting XI with the likes of Luke Shaw, Harry Maguire and Mason Mount given time to impress off the bench. New signing Bryan Mbeumo was expected to make his first appearance for the club, but although the 25-year-old arrived at the MetLife Stadium with the rest of the United team he wasn't deemed fit enough to make the squad.",
      "Those changes did disrupt United's flow, and the Hammers hit back when Jarrod Bowen rifled home a majestic finish from the angle - but it ended up being just a consolation.",
      "\"I felt good. Training has been very good. We have been doing very well. It's good to win the game, even it being a friendly and to go into the season in a positive way.",
      "\"Overall the game was good. We was good on the ball. In some moments we could have kept possession for longer as the manager was asking - we rushed a bit in the final third when trying to score our goals. We will work on that.\"",
      "On Cunha: \"The Brazilians are very loud, very happy. He's a very funny guy and has settled very quickly with everyone. That's good as we need to him to connect with every player and get the best out of him.\"",
      "Man Utd boss Ruben Amorim:",
      "On Bruno Fernandes during his press conference: \"Now he has more players, I feel, to help him to lead the group and that is a good thing. He is our leader and really important, not just on the field, but off the field. He leads by example. He works really hard, is always available and, sometimes, he plays with pain. Sometimes, the problem is he gets frustrated and loses a little bit of focus of his job. Sometimes, he wants to help his teammates so much, it is not the best thing to do.",
      "\"Last year, I felt sometimes I pushed him back to have more possession in the build-up and we miss Bruno near the box. With different characteristics from Bryan [Mbeumo] and Matheus Cunha, and I really like Kobbie Mainoo's game, he will have more help this season.",
      "\"Bruno runs a lot, maybe in the sprints he is a different player but he runs a lot. He has a lot of endurance and he is smart. It's not about that. Physicality with Bruno is not a concern, playing him deep or as an attacking midfielder.\"",
      "On whether he's made a decision on his team for opening PL fixture vs Arsenal: \"It was a strong team and we need to prepare all the players, and we don't have a lot of weeks or a lot of games to prepare all the team.",
      "\"That can change, you saw in the second half, there are players who can play in the first game. It's not a decision I made already.\"",
