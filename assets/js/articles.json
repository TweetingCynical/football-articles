      "Benjamin Sesko faces the prospect of missing up to eight Manchester United matches, after the full severity of his knee injury was disclosed. The big-money summer signing was substituted during their 2-2 stalemate vs Tottenham - with several updates surfacing throughout the November international period.",
      "Slovenia manager Matjaz Kek initially indicated that no correspondence had been received from United prior to their fixture against Kosovo. That's while also emphasising that the national side warranted respect.",
      "Following defeat in that encounter, which meant Slovenia and Sesko will not be at next summer's tournament in the United States, Kek provided a further update that clearly outlined his position on various matters.",
      "\"Completely expected from the English media,\" he remarked regarding his earlier comments being blown out of proportion. \"But I emphasise, once again, the moment that communication was established between us and the Manchester United medical team, the problem was solved in five minutes.\"",
      "The essence of that discussion was, presumably, to confirm his unavailability, with United also bracing themselves to be without their No.30 for several weeks at minimum. The Athletic have reported that Sesko is now expected to be side-lined for approximately one month with a knee complaint.",
      "They have also highlighted that contingent on how his rehabilitation progresses, the 22-year-old could be absent for anything between three to five weeks. Should it prove to be the shorter timeframe, Sesko would potentially miss home fixtures at Old Trafford against Everton and West Ham United, as well as away journeys to Crystal Palace and Wolves.",
      "A five-week absence would also see him miss Premier League clashes against Bournemouth and Aston Villa, with a potential return on Boxing Day at home to Newcastle United. United will be keen for Sesko to be fit by then, especially as key attackers Amad and Bryan Mbeumo are set to represent Ivory Coast and Cameroon respectively at AFCON.",
      "Before Sesko's injury at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, Harry Maguire and Casemiro were both substituted but appear to have escaped injury. Casemiro has since played and scored for Brazil, while Maguire, who was clutching his hamstring, has been seen putting in the effort at the gym.",
      "Long-term absentee Lisandro Martinez is also nearing a much-needed return. However, it's likely his comeback will be carefully managed given that he hasn't played since February.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Manchester United have been told that signing Antoine Semenyo would take Ruben Amorim's side to the 'next level' - and Bournemouth will be powerless to stop them. Semenyo, 25, started the season on fire with six goals and three assists in six Premier League games.",
      "The Red Devils have prioritised signing players who are proven in the English top flight since Jason Wilcox became their sporting director, evidenced by the big-money arrivals of Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo. United are also keen on the likes of Elliot Anderson, Carlos Baleba, Joao Gomes and Adam Wharton, further proof that their focus is on domestic deals.",
      "Semenyo was a target for the Red Devils this summer, with Amorim reportedly meeting him for a meal in London to assess the forward's character. Since then, Semenyo's stock has risen rapidly, prompting links with Liverpool and Tottenham.",
      "It's recently emerged that the Ghana international has a £65million release clause which can be activated in January. Bournemouth therefore know that they won't be able to block Semenyo from leaving if he wishes, despite him signing a new five-year deal in July.",
      "A club would have to trigger his clause within the first two weeks of the transfer window in order to give the Cherries sufficient time to find a replacement for the 25-year-old. United have a golden opportunity to sign Semenyo, and former Arsenal and Manchester City right-back Bacary Sagna thinks that Old Trafford would be a 'good destination'.",
      "\"Looking forward, if he was to leave Bournemouth and stay in the Premier League, I think Manchester United would be a suitable option for him,\" Sagna told Oddspedia. \"He could definitely help the club get back to the top end of the league and if he did join them, he'd be regarded as the player which made the difference and take United to the next level.",
      "\"He's young, fresh and has proven he can shine in big games this season - so I think Old Trafford could be a good destination for him.\"",
      "However, the Frenchman doesn't believe that Semenyo should quit Bournemouth just yet. \"If I was Antoine Semenyo, I would stay at Bournemouth until the end of the season,\" Sagna added.",
      "\"As a player, moving clubs in the January transfer window can be disruptive; it's much better to stay until the summer and then make a decision, and integrate into the team properly - rather than joining midway through a campaign.\"",
      "Semenyo will have the chance to audition at Old Trafford when Bournemouth make the visit on December 15. United aren't expected to spend big in January but in order to steal a march on their rivals, Wilcox and Co. might have to pull the trigger.",

      "Matheus Cunha has hailed Manchester United boss Ruben Amorim as ‘a winner’ and admitted he sees his best role as a 'false nine'. The Brazilian forward was tempted to move to Old Trafford by Amorim this summer after the Red Devils activated the £62.5m release clause in his Wolves contract.",
      "So far, Cunha has had a slow start to life at Old Trafford, having scored just once in his opening 11 appearances for the club. That form has coincided with a rollercoaster start to the season for United.",
      "The club endured a woeful first few months of the season, which saw the pressure crank up on Amorim. That has alleviated over recent weeks and Cunha has now made his feelings very clear on the Portuguese coach and teammate Bryan Mbeumo.",
      "Speaking to Hayters while on international duty with Brazil, he said: “Amazing. What a player [Mbeumo]. You asked me some questions to think about United, right now my mind is in Brazil.",
      "“But it’s amazing to be there and it’s amazing to play with big players like Bryan. And to be coached by a winner is always something I feel privileged about.\"",
      "Cunha has played a number of roles throughout his career, both with his former clubs and current employers. Asked what his favourite position was, the 26-year-old claimed he was just happy to play, albeit preferred to take to the pitch as more of a withdrawn forward.",
      "He added: “My favourite position is to be on the pitch and help my team of course. Right now in Brazil, I have a different job to come a little bit and help the team in the build-up and attack as a striker.",
      "“I feel fine playing as a false nine, exactly, this kind of participation in the build-up and get on the ball more.”",
      "Cunha played just over an hour for Brazil earlier this week as they took on Senegal at the Emirates Stadium and he could be back in action on Tuesday evening against Tunisia. He will then turn his attention back to United.",

      "Antoine Semenyo's future could be one of the biggest talking points of the January transfer window. Notching six goals and three assists in Bournemouth's first six games of the Premier League season, the forward started the campaign on fire.",
      "Two of those came on the opening night against Liverpool, as the Cherries came from behind to level the scores at Anfield - only to lose 4-2 in the dying embers. Although Semenyo, 25, hasn't scored or assisted since the start of October, interest in him persists.",
      "It emerged on Monday that the Ghana international has a £65million release clause, adding to the simmering speculation over his future. Semenyo signed a new contract with Bournemouth in July, supposedly keeping him on the south coast until 2030.",
      "But Liverpool and Manchester United could test the Cherries' resolve this winter, with Tottenham also linked. It wouldn't be the first time that Semenyo has spoken to one of the so-called 'Big Six' either.",
      "While Bournemouth aren't pushovers by any means, they do have to accept reality. That's why chiefs at the Vitality Stadium have reluctantly accepted that they're powerless to stop Semenyo from leaving as soon as January, despite wanting to keep him until at least the end of this season.",
      "The Athletic were first to report news of his £65m release clause as well as Bournemouth's acceptance that a departure could be just over six weeks away. Notably, the proposed buyer - which can be any club at home or abroad - must activate the clause by a specific date in order to allow Bournemouth a couple of weeks to find a replacement.",
      "In a recent interview, Tim Bezbatchenko, general manager at Bournemouth, admitted that he'd struggle to deny Semenyo a move to an elite club and even mentioned Liverpool. \"When a club like Real Madrid, Liverpool, PSG come in and they're competing for Champions League positions, who are we to say, 'No, you can't go, you can't fulfil your dream',\" Bezbatchenko told the Business of Sport podcast.",
      "\"No it wouldn't be like that for all clubs because not everyone is Real Madrid. But there is an opportunity and everybody wins right? I think that's what we're trying to find, this commonality where everybody can win.\"",
      "With the signings of Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo, and interest in the likes of Elliot Anderson, Carlos Baleba and Adam Wharton, it's clear that United want to recruit Premier League-proven stars. That explains why Ruben Amorim reportedly had dinner with Semenyo in London at the end of last season to assess his character.",
      "Old Trafford chiefs Omar Berrada and Jason Wilcox are also said to have held talks with Bournemouth, with United willing to pay £55m. But it's claimed via The Transfers Podcast that Semenyo rejected their advances after discovering that United intended to offer him less money than their other targets.",
      "Liverpool may've spent £320m to reshape their attack just a few months ago but the Premier League champions are still looking to add to their squad. Multiple reports say that Liverpool are keeping tabs on the 25-year-old, who joined Bournemouth from Bristol City for £10m in January 2023.",
      "On paper, Semenyo would find it hard to find a place in Arne Slot's side but their form this season suggests that a readymade goalscorer could be exactly what they need. But can they afford another expensive outlay in the same financial year?",

      "Manchester United are set to bide their time come January in their pursuit of Crystal Palace starlet Adam Wharton. A pair of United legends agree that the 21-year-old is full of quality going forward.",
      "Ruben Amorim was given some new attacking tools to work with over the summer as Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko arrived at Old Trafford. According to new reports it is his midfield that will be bolstered next.",
      "United supposedly have a long shortlist of midfield talent they will look to recruit and Palace ace Wharton is high in the club's estimations. Despite both Roy Keane and Rio Ferdinand agreeing that one aspect of his game is game-changing, it is thought that any approach will have to wait until next summer.",
      "Since Wharton arrived at Selhurst Park in January 2024 for £18.5million from Blackburn Rovers, he has quickly and seamlessly transitioned into one of the Premier League's finest young midfield stars.",
      "He is usually employed as a deep-lying playmaker, with a defensive engine, high IQ and a wide range of passing, which has been praised by United icons Keane and Ferdinand.",
      "Wharton is already in contention for England caps and he was in from the start in their latest 2-0 win against Albania. It was in this tie that Keane picked out what he thinks is the youngster's greatest quality.",
      "\"I do like Adam Wharton,\" said Keane after the win. \"A lot of the modern midfielders, their first option seems to be, 'Can I go sideways or backwards?'",
      "\"What I like about him, the first option he seems to look at it is, 'Can I pass it forward?' and that's a big strength to have. This is where he can mature over the next year or two if he's playing at the top level.",
      "\"Put demands onto people. Shout at players, go, 'Give me the ball!' That's what I used to do, I used to fall out with people a lot. 'Give me the ball!' Put demands on your team-mates.",
      "\"He's still new to it, so I'm not going to be too harsh on him. But as he matures and starts playing more games, put demands on your team-mates.\"",
      "Ferdinand agrees and is equally as impressed with Wharton's attacking transitions. He said on his Rio Ferdinand Presents YouTube channel: \"I would sign another central midfielder this summer to play alongside Manuel Ugarte. That player needs to be able to take the ball and transfer it up the pitch. You know who I would go for? Adam Wharton.",
      "\"I would go get him. The reason I would take him is that he can get on the ball and transfer it up the pitch. Wharton has got a great range of passing. I think he would be a great addition to the United squad. He reminds me of Michael Carrick a bit.\"",
      "However, though it may be tempting to approach Wharton in January, ESPN report that United have a detailed plan regarding recruiting a midfielder. They suggest that Wharton is on the club's radar, but any move will be put off until next summer.",
      "United will reportedly shave off up to £1m per week in wages after players such as Casemiro, Harry Maguire and Jadon Sancho depart with their contracts set to expire in 2026. Marcus Rashford is also a high earner that the club are hoping can be offloaded after his loan move to Barcelona.",
      "The club are set to bide their time during the January window and then allow these stars to depart come the summer, which should free up some funds to pursue their top targets. These reportedly include Wharton, as well as Brighton's Carlos Baleba and Stuttgart's Angelo Stiller.",

      "Mikel Arteta's side was one of the driving forces behind the proposed introduction of 'anchoring', which would limit Premier League clubs to spending five times the figure paid in prize money and broadcast revenue to the side that finishes bottom of the division.",
      "Based on the most recent figures available from the 2023-24 campaign, clubs would be able to spend £550million based on the money Sheffield United earned after finishing 20th that season, receiving £109.5million.",
      "However, The Times claim that the departure of Tim Lewis from the Emirates Stadium, the former Arsenal executive vice-chairman, has softened the Premier League leaders' stance and plunged the plans into doubt.",
      "The report claims eight clubs are 'habouring reservations' over changes to the rules ahead of Friday's shareholder meeting. It adds that some clubs believe financial restrictions will impact Premier League clubs' performances in Europe and run the risk of missing out on world-class talent to rival leagues.",
      "Any change to impose anchoring would need a majority vote of 14 clubs voting in favour, with Arsenal among the 16 clubs to vote in favour of exploring anchoring last year.",
      "However, both Manchester United and Manchester City are opposed to introducing new regulations, and the Gunners' change in stance could seriously threaten the proposals.",
      "When contacted by The Mirror, the Premier League said: \"It is the League’s objective to maintain the Premier League’s value, competitive balance and ensure clubs operate in a financially sustainable way.",
      "\"We are engaging with our clubs, and they will continue to evaluate the proposals. They will have the opportunity to vote on them later this month.\"",

      "A spokesperson from the PFA warned: \"We've been clear with the Premier League that it is something we will oppose, but the Premier League themselves know that, even before the PFA does this, there will be clubs within their own room who will legally challenge the measure.",
      "\"The only ones who end up winning are the lawyers. We want to talk about football, we don't want to talk about legal bills. There are ways to engage on measures around financial sustainability, but this cannot be imposed unilaterally; it needs to be negotiated, and there are mechanisms (to consult) that need to be respected.\"",
      "In an official statement to Mirror Sport, responding to the above claim, a Premier League spokesperson said: \"We disagree with the PFA’s views regarding the proposed financial rules and the extensive consultation process we have been conducting with our clubs and other stakeholders.",
      "\"The PFA has had numerous opportunities since March 2024 to provide feedback on, and shape, the proposals and the principles that underpin them. Where the League has received feedback on the New Financial System from stakeholders, including the PFA, we have considered it carefully and, where appropriate, incorporated it into formulating the draft rules.",

Camp Nou was always one of my favourite stadiums and one I wanted to play in. But to play on it for Barcelona is going to be a different feeling. I cannot wait to be on the pitch.

      "Brighton have harnessed a reputation as one of the most effective talent factories in the Premier League over recent seasons. But the Seagulls have not been afraid of selling their star men.",
      "The next off of the conveyer belt looks set to be Cameroonian midfielder Carlos Baleba. United are long-term admirers of the 21-year-old and attempted to sign him in the summer.",
      "They are expected to renew their interest in the near future but may have to pay up to £100m to secure his signature. Speaking earlier this season, Brighton chief Tony Bloom said: “I don’t think Baleba was a saga. There was interest from Manchester United, and we said that he wasn't available this summer and they went away.",
      "“So we've had many bigger sagas in the past. But Carlos Baleba, his improvement has been immense. Massively important player to this football club, and just delighted that he's with us for this season.”",
      "This one looks unlikely in January - but could become a real option next summer.",
      "Despite Wolves’ rotten season so far, Brazilian midfielder Joao Gomes has been a bright spot. The 24-year-old has emerged as one of the Black Country side's best players since his 2023 arrival from Flamengo.",
      "Recent reports have suggested that Man United are keeping a keen eye on him, with £44m thought to be enough to seal his services. In the meantime, former Wolves star Matheus Cunha has also shared his admiration of his compatriot.",
      "There are some caveats to a potential move though. Gomes only signed a new deal back in April, while Wolves might not be too keen on cashing in during the January window as they attempt to rescue their Premier League spot.",
      "Wolves have also promised new boss Rob Edwards that they won't be selling any key players in the winter window. Of course, that could change should United make an offer way in excess of Wolves' reported valuation. United will certainly be keeping an eye on developments ahead of any potential swoop.",
      "The former Chelsea star enjoyed an impressive debut season with following his permanent move to Spain, but Gallagher has fallen out of favour this term and has made just two league starts.",
      "It has already been suggested that the Red Devils have submitted an enquiry regarding the England star. And while Gallagher has revealed that he is ‘not satisfied’ with his current situation, he is not actively looking for a move away.",
      "He said: “No, no, of course not. I'm not satisfied. I don't think anyone is if they're not playing as much as they'd like, but I'll keep working very hard to help the team whenever I have the chance, and hopefully more opportunities to be a starter will come.",
      "“I'm very happy here. My goal is to win titles with Atleti and I want to have a bigger role in the team. And, as I've said, I'm going to keep working as hard as I can to play more minutes and help the team.”",
      "Gallagher remains under contract with Atletico until 2029. As it stands, he looks to be the most likely option for the Red Devils.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Former Premier League referee Mike Dean has denied Manchester United bias following complaints from rival supporters. The issues have been sparked following high-profile decisions being made during high-stakes matches in the Premier League.",
      "There has been a stigma surrounding United and referees for a number of years, which came to a head when former Liverpool winger Ryan Babel posted a picture of referee Howard Webb in a Manchester United kit following their encounter in 2011, landing him a £10,000 fine.",
      "Current top-flight referee Anthony Taylor has been in charge of a number of showdowns between the two North West clubs in recent years, which often sparks anger due to Taylor's affiliation with Greater Manchester, having grown up in Altrincham, also supporting the National League side.",
      "But the Wirral-born referee was keen to dismiss the notion of refereeing bias against any Premier League club, using Taylor as an example.",
      "\"I get where you’re coming from and Anthony [Taylor] is from Altrincham, he has supported them. He does Man United against Liverpool,\" he said speaking on the Overlap's Fan Debate. \"Having said that, Liverpool fans never complained when I officiated them and I’m a Tranmere fan. I get where you’re coming from and there could be a bit more thought in that.",
      "\"Sometimes, unfortunately, the best refs that we have live in certain areas, so there’s nothing you can do. You’re not going to have Man City vs Liverpool refereed by a guy who has only done one or two years in the Premier League, whether it's Oliver, Brooks or Kavanagh. It was like when Stuart Attwell did a game at Everton and gave a penalty, did someone complain?\"",
      "The game Dean is referencing involved Everton and Luton Town, where the Hatters were awarded a penalty. Luton picked up an important win during a crucial time in the Premier League relegation battle.",
      "The decision angered Nottingham Forest, leading to a social media post from the City Ground club, which ultimately landed the club an unprecedented fine of £750,000.",
      "Dean also discussed a so-called bias towards the Premier League's big six. But the 57-year-old feels that officials are making big calls against those teams on home soil now, more than ever.",
      "He said: \"You’ve got to ref what’s put out in front of you, if there’s a big call, make a big call. Refs aren’t afraid of big calls if it’s for the so-called, as you say, teams at Man U, City or Liverpool.",
      "\"If it’s an unpopular call, it’s an unpopular decision. You’ve got to referee 11 v 11 and forget what’s around. If you go to Burnley against Man City, I sent Sterling off for taking his shirt off, you could’ve said I overlooked it against a smaller team but you have to referee what’s in front of you.\"",
      "Liverpool recently lodged a complaint with the PGMOL (Professional Game Match Officials Limited) after Virgil van Dijk's header was ruled out for offside against Andy Robertson. The Reds didn't cite any foul play but were unhappy with the reasoning behind the Dutchman's header being chalked off.",
      "The referee for the encounter was Chris Kavanagh, with Michael Oliver on VAR. Meanwhile, Arne Slot was left aggrieved during their defeat to Manchester United after Bryan Mbeumo's opener early on.",
      "Alexis Mac Allister went down with a head injury after a collision with Van Dijk, but play continued, leading to United earning the lead. The referee in the middle for that was Michael Oliver as Harry Maguire scored late on to inflict further misery on the Reds.",
      "Taylor has managed more Liverpool matches than any other club, 12 more times than the likes of Arsenal and Chelsea, while he has officiated 55 United games and 49 Manchester City outings.",
      "In his last 10 matches involving the Premier League champions, he has been in charge of games against either City or United on three occasions.",

      "Manchester United boss Ruben Amorim will move to strengthen his midfield in January to bolster the club's Champions League hopes.",
      "United are unbeaten in five Premier League outings, their best run under Amorim since his appointment 12 months ago, and there is real belief at Old Trafford that they can return to European football's top table next term. As such, they're ready to build on what club chiefs believe was an extremely positive summer transfer window when the new year hits.",
      "Having spent £200million to rebuild the club's ailing attack and finding themselves a new No.1 in the shape of Senne Lammens, adding more quality to United's midfield ranks is the next port of call. Casemiro and Bruno Fernandes have emerged as Amorim's preferred options, but the Brazilian's long-term future remains in question, while there is also speculation that Uruguay international Manuel Ugarte could be sold to raise funds.",
      "There are also questions over the future of Kobbie Mainoo, with Amorim uncertain over his best role and the player having seen his World Cup hopes dwindle due to a lack of playing time.",
      "Nottingham Forest and England midfielder Elliot Anderson is well liked at United, but the likes of Liverpool and Manchester City are also keeping tabs on a player whose reputation is growing fast, while Brighton's Carlos Baleba is a long-term target. However, both would likely cost in excess of £100m.",
      "But, as first reported in Portugal, Wolves' Joao Gomes has emerged as an alternative. The Brazil international, hailed previously as \"unbelievable\" by United No.10 Matheus Cunha - a team-mate with the Selecao and during their time together at Molineux - has extensively been watched by United chiefs over the past 18 months and could be available for much cheaper than the aforementioned £100m duo. A £44m price tag has been mooted abroad.",
      "And that includes something akin to a gentleman's agreement with their new head coach not to sell the club's prized assets in January to give them the best possible chance of staying in to the Premier League. And that means keeping the ex-Flamengo star.",
      "Of course, that could change if United made an offer worth greatly in excess of Wolves' valuation of Gomes. But that figure would need to be well above the mooted price.",
      "For Gomes' part, he has a World Cup with Brazil next summer to think about and knows he needs to be playing regularly in the Premier League to give himself the best possible opportunity of being in Carlo Ancelotti's squad. He gets that at Wolves and may not initially in Manchester. However, a move to United may not still be there for him in summer, if United have other options on the table.",

      "Manchester United have seen their interest in Wolves ace Joao Gomes given the green light by Matheus Cunha, who has hailed the Brazilian as \"unbelievable\". Recent reports suggest that the Red Devils are keen on signing Gomes in the January transfer window.",
      "Some rumours have even gone so far as to suggest that a £44million deal could bring the Brazilian to Old Trafford in the New Year - although Wolves insist he's not for sale as they fight for their Premier League place. Gomes has previously been linked with a move to United, with rumours intensifying as the January window approaches.",
      "United are in the market for a new midfielder, with several names being thrown into the mix, including Carlos Baleba of Brighton and Elliot Anderson of Nottingham Forest.",
      "Given the ongoing speculation, United may be tempted to enter the running to sign Gomes give his price tag is much less than half the price of other rumoured targets.",
      "The 26-year-old revealed in an interview in July 2024 why he sees similarities between Gomes and United star Casemiro, who has become his teammate at both club and international level. The United No.10 also hinted at why Gomes would be a welcome addition to Amorim's squad, describing the midfielder as 'humble'.",
      "\"Maybe Casemiro,\" Cunha said last year when asked which players reminds him of Gomes. \"He is a bit older now, but I put Casemiro's name there only to show where Joao Gomes could arrive.",
      "\"I think Joao has the possibility to arrive. He is very humble, and he works a lot. The good teams come like a gift when you do that.\"",
      "\"He is unbelievable on the pitch,\" Cunha added. \"I feel very secure. I feel like I can lose the ball when I have my midfielders behind me. He played very well for the national team, too.\"",
      "Casemiro has already won two major trophies during his time with United with triumphs in the FA Cup and Carabao Cup. Not to mention, the 33-year-old was part of a Real Madrid team that won three La Liga titles as well as five Champions League trophies.",

      "Manchester United face off against Everton after the international break. Ruben Amorim's side haven't lost a Premier League match since late September.",
      "Head coach Amorim's days in Manchester seemed numbered to begin with this campaign but a remarkable turnaround sees his team sitting just six points off second place. A host of players are currently away with their respective nations but will return later this week as they prepare to face the Toffees.",
      "Club captain Bruno Fernandes has been starring for Portugal and his country secured 2026 World Cup qualification on Sunday evening with a 9-1 thrashing of Armenia. Fernandes played in an advanced role on the night and sent a message to his club coach with his performance.",
      "In Portugal's 9-1 domination, Fernandes grabbed three goals. Manager Roberto Martinez played Fernandes as an attacking midfielder in a three, with two more defensive players just in behind him.",
      "He has not been playing in such an advanced role under Amorim, instead having to do a bit more defensive work as part of a midfield two, with either Casemiro or Manuel Ugarte beside him.",
      "For his country, Fernandes thrived further up the pitch and while two of his goals did come from the penalty spot, he bagged one from open play and also set up another in what was an accomplished display.",
      "The 31-year-old has done well in a more attacking midfield role for other United coaches but with the likes of Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo taking up wide positions, Amorim's setup seems not to allow for such a position. Fernandes' display sent a message nevertheless.",
      "United bolstered their attacking options over the summer with the signings of Mbeumo and Cunha, as well as Benjamin Sesko. Reports now suggest it is their midfield that will receive an overhaul next.",
      "ESPN reports that there are a plethora of midfield talents that the club have their eye on, namely Brighton's Carlos Baleba, Crystal Palace star Adam Wharton and Stuttgart's Angelo Stiller.",
      "In order to afford such new talent, it has been reported that the club will look to offload some of their highest earners. Jadon Sancho is one player mentioned in the report, as well as Marcus Rashford.",
      "The Englishman is currently on loan at Barcelona but his deal at Old Trafford nets him £325,000 per week. Casemiro and Harry Maguire could also depart, unless they agree new terms on dramatically lower wages.",
      "Another name that has been floated as a potential midfield target is former Chelsea star Conor Gallagher. The Englishman moved to Spanish side Atletico Madrid in the summer of 2024 and despite a strong start, he's found minutes hard to come by this season.",
      "Back in September, it was reported that United might launch a late loan move for Gallagher before the window closed. This never did materialise. But Gallagher has now addressed his lack of game time and transfer rumours.",
      "He told AS: \"I'm not satisfied. I don't think anyone would be if they don't play as much as they would like but I will continue to work very hard to, whenever I have the opportunity, help the team and hopefully more opportunities will come to be a starter.\"",
      "Gallagher added: \"I'm very happy here. My goal is to win titles with Atleti, and I want to have a bigger role in the team. And, as I said, I'm going to continue working to the maximum to play more minutes and be able to help the team.\"",

      "Arsenal players might publicly dismiss talk of them being title favourites this season, but deep down they will be well aware that this is their chance to end a 21-year wait. In fact, it is highly likely that Mikel Arteta, with his unique methods, has drilled it into their collective mindset that 2025/26 is their season.",
      "It has also been visible in the Champions League, where the north Londoners are one of three teams left with a 100% winning record after four games. There is no doubt that they are well equipped to win both competitions this season.",
      "Cristhian Mosquera was Arsenal’s least high-profile signing of the summer. When the Spanish centre-half’s arrival was announced, for a mere sum of £13million, few could have predicted that he’d deliver the kind of assured performances he has managed so far in his fledgling career in north London.",
      "Initially brought in as a back-up, Mosquera was thrown into the deep end at Anfield in August following an injury to William Saliba, where the 21-year-old’s calmness instantly eased the Gunners faithful’s nerves. His 12 appearances already this season, conceding only three goals in 10 hours of action, are a sign that he has the trust of his manager, something Arteta made clear from their very first conversation prior to his transfer.",
      "Mosquera told The Guardian: “Before I had decided [whether to join Arsenal], someone in my camp said, ‘The moment you speak to Mikel, there’s no way he won’t convince you.’ And that’s exactly how it happened. When the call finished, my destination couldn’t have been clearer.”",
      "He added when asked about his compatriot’s intensity: “Yes, totally, totally. He really lives for football, he was raised on it, experienced everything. You see that when he talks. He loves the detail, sees things other eyes might not. I’m so happy with him. He’s an incredible person and he’s helping me a lot. The staff have made it easy. Arsenal is an incredible club.”",
      "Arteta may need to use those same powers of persuasion if Arsenal ramp up their pursuit of Olympiacos starlet Christos Mouzakitis. The Greek central midfielder, 18, quickly became an important player for the reigning champions after breaking through last term.",
      "He has made 13 appearances this season, including a brief cameo against Arsenal when the two sides met in the Champions League in October, while registering two assists. His composure, ball-carrying ability and maturity have also earned him seven caps for the national team despite his tender age.",
      "With scouts from all over Europe regularly being spotted at Olympiacos games, there is believed to be an impending tug of war between Arsenal, Manchester United and Aston Villa over the talent. Caughtoffside claim Arsenal have sent scouts on over ten occasions this season alone, with Arteta said to be impressed with Mouzakitis’ passing range, technical ability and work off the ball.",

      "Karim Adeyemi was fined £396,000 after admitting to the possession of a pair of brass knuckles and a taser. The Borussia Dortmund forward saw his case concluded at a district court in Hagen in the state of North Rhine-Westphalia, and has avoided a public trial.",
      "He also will not be given a criminal record. Instead, he must cough up a fine which has been calculated at 60 daily rates of £6,600 (€7,500), 'in accordance with his salary.'",
      "The payments relating to the offence, which dates back to 2024, also started on October 30, as per The Athletic. German law prohibits the possession of either item, and can carry a sentence of up to three years behind bars.",
      "In an official statement, Adeyemi's club said: \"BVB always takes criminal allegations seriously and uses them as an opportunity to discuss them with its employees while respecting confidentiality obligations,\" reports the MEN - who have approached both the German Football Association and the player's representative for comment.",
      "It comes as the 23-year-old is currently on international duty with Germany, who secured qualification to the 2026 World Cup on Monday night with a 6-0 thrashing of Slovakia thanks to goals from Nick Woltemade, Serge Gnabry, Ridle Baku, Assan Ouedraogo and a brace from Leroy Sane.",
      "Manager Julian Nagelsmann was also questioned about Adeyemi's situation by reporters during a press conference on Sunday, but remained tight-lipped. He said: \"The issue is a bit too big before such an important game, for all of us and for German football. Therefore, I will not comment on any further inquiries - regardless of their nature.\"",
      "Thanks to his performances on the pitch for club and country, Adeyemi has reportedly seen interest from numerous Premier League teams, including Manchester United. While the winger is under contract until 2027, he is said to be unsettled with Dortmund as the January transfer window looms.",
      "Adeyemi has three goals and five assists to his name from 14 appearances this term, but clashed with BVB manager Niko Kovac recently when he was substituted, throwing a bottle at the bench in frustration. Speaking about the incident, the head coach said: \"I think that's unnecessary. It's okay that he can be angry sometimes, but that's unnecessary; he's an adult.\"",
      "As per Bild, Dortmund are hopeful of negotiating a new contract with Adeyemi, but his agent, Jorge Mendes, wants a £70million release clause inserting into any new deal at the Signal Iduna Park. It comes as Ruben Amorim may not opt to add more firepower to his side when they January transfer window rolls around.",
      "The Portuguese tactician is currently reaping the benefits of bringing in Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko this summer, as United sit seventh in the Premier League standings - unbeaten in their last five outings. Many fans may also argue that the manager would be far better off strengthening the heart of his midfield, considering Bruno Fernandes has dropped into a deeper role alongside an ageing Casemiro.",
      "While United were linked with securing the services of Brighton and Hove Albion starlet, Carlos Baleba, for the majority of the summer, the Seagulls' £100m price tag proved too hot to handle. And while the club may choose to revisit their pursuit in a little over a month, they have also been linked with a number of other suitable players as of recent for a fraction of the cost.",
      "VfB Stuttgart's Angelo Stiller is one name who has come up in conversation, while Crystal Palace's Adam Wharton has also been speculated as a transfer target. Elsewhere, Nottingham Forest's Elliot Anderson has also been suggested as a good fit at Old Trafford, as well as Wolves midfielder Joao Gomes.",

      "If the projected recovery time of a month from the injury is accurate, he could be back in action for the Wolves match on December 8.",
      "This schedule could see Sesko sidelined for United's Premier League clashes against Everton, Crystal Palace and West Ham.",

      "Antoine Semenyo has a £65million release clause in his Bournemouth contract, which could leave Liverpool and Manchester United licking their lips. After finding himself linked with both clubs this summer, Semenyo committed his future to the Cherries.",
      "However, despite signing a new deal which should keep him at the Vitality Stadium until 2030, he could find himself on the move as early as January due to a new revelation.",
      "As per The Athletic, the Ghanaian's new contract holds a £65m release clause, which any club can trigger. It's said that Bournemouth have reluctantly 'accepted' that his future is out of their hands, and a January move could be possible.",
      "The report also details how Semenyo was valued at around £70m this summer, with his release clause allowing interested parties to secure his services for marginally cheaper come January. However, it is also claimed that Liverpool or United - or any other suitors for that matter - will have to activate his clause by a certain date to allow the Cherries to find a replacement.",
      "It comes as Semenyo recently dismissed claims that he was keen on parting ways with his current club. When pressed by Jamie Redknapp about his future recently, the Ghana international responded: \"I don't think about it too much.",
      "\"I try to stay present as much as I can. You see the news all the time, I see it as well, I'm not oblivious, but I try to keep focused.",
      "\"I'm enjoying my football here. If I'm not scoring goals, all of that goes away. I try to stay present, do the best I can for the team, score goals and whatever happens in the future happens.",
      "\"When they [his former team-mates] all left [in the summer], there was a lot of interest and back and forth with the club. But I knew in my head that the manager's got something up his sleeve this year.",
      "\"How we finished off the season last year was so good and we could continue, especially with the players we've bought in as well. I wasn't too sure at the start but we've kicked on like a house on fire. I'm glad I committed to staying here because I'm enjoying every moment.\"",
      "After bagging an impressive tally of 13 goals across all competitions last season, Semenyo found himself at the heart of speculation surrounding a transfer to United or Liverpool, while Tottenham also showed an interest. In the end, United snapped up Bryan Mbeumo, Matheus Cunha and Benjamin Sesko, while Liverpool welcomed the likes of Florian Wirtz, Alexander Isak and Hugo Ekitike.",
      "Spurs also snapped up Mohammed Kudus in a £55m deal with West Ham United. However, with six Premier League goals to his name this term thus far, the clubs could once again register an interest in the 25-year-old when the transfer window re-opens in January.",
      "Despite spending big this summer, Arne Slot has failed to inspire performances from Liverpool this season, with the defending Premier League champions languishing at eighth in the table at present with six wins and five losses from their opening 11 outings.",
      "And while Manchester United have started to come into good form under the stewardship of Ruben Amorim, questions still remain regarding the suitability of Sesko as a sole striker, given his age and lack of top-flight experience.",
      "Elsewhere, Spurs may sit fifth in the Premier League standings, but with Semenyo holding a lead of two goals on their top-scorer in Richarlison at present, they may be open to the idea of bringing in the Bournemouth sensation as an upgrade.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "The midfielder was given 75 minutes as Thomas Tuchel's side ground out a 2-0 win against Albania in Tirana and wrapped up their perfect World Cup qualifying campaign. Wharton created the most chances in the game (three) and made his case to be on the plane to North America next summer.",
      "At half-time, Keane was asked about the youngster, who joined Palace from boyhood club Blackburn Rovers for an initial £18million in January 2024. \"I do like Adam Wharton,\" Keane said on ITV.",
      "\"A lot of the modern midfielders, their first option seems to be, 'Can I go sideways or backwards?' What I like about him, the first option he seems to look at it is, 'Can I pass it forward?' and that's a big strength to have.",
      "\"This is where he can mature over the next year or two if he's playing at the top level, put demands onto people. He's a bit soft there. Shout at players.",
      "\"Go, 'Give me the ball!' That's what I used to do, I used to fall out with people a lot. 'Give me the ball!' Put demands on your team-mates.",
      "\"He's still new to it, so I'm not going to be too harsh on him. But as he matures and starts playing more games, put demands on your team-mates.\"",
      "Last week, Wharton - who's helped Palace win the FA Cup and Community Shield this year - was asked about the speculation linking him with a move to Old Trafford and he gave an interesting response. \"I don't really look into it or think too much about it,\" the 21-year-old told The Athletic.",
      "\"There are always rumours floating about on social media. Is it true? Is it not? You tell me. My friends, my family, my brothers, everyone will message me and be like, 'Is it true this club's interested?' I'm like, 'Thanks for telling me because I didn't know'.\"",
      "When pressed on United's interest, Wharton replied: \"I don't know who's spreading it or who at United is looking at it. I see it and I'm like, 'Okay', and then I carry on with my day.",
      "\"United, the big teams, they're all linked to 10, 20 different players. If I'm one of 20, then it's nothing special, so it doesn't really mean too much. I speak with my agent about planning ahead and possibilities.",
      "\"But at the end of the day, it is who's interested and who's willing to try and get you and if that becomes the case? You can speak about it, but you've got to represent that on the pitch and prove that you deserve it.\"",

      "Nottingham Forest are understood to have categorically ruled out selling Elliot Anderson in the January transfer window amid interest from Manchester United in the England midfielder.",
      "Anderson, 23, has been installed as one of the Red Devils’ prime targets as Ruben Amorim plots a complete overhaul of his midfield. A £100m price tag has been touted for the player, albeit it remains to be seen whether United would be able to stump up such a fee. And it has now emerged that Forest have no intention of sanctioning a mid-season sale with the January transfer window opening in a matter of weeks.",
      "According to The Telegraph, Forest will NOT be tempted into selling Anderson in the winter window as they attempt to turn their season around under their new head coach, Sean Dyche. They are anticipating interest next summer, though, with United and Anderson’s former club Newcastle known to be among those keen on signing him.",
      "Anderson, who signed for £15m from Newcastle last summer, penned a five-year contract at the City Ground. The report goes on to suggest that there is no buy-back or sell-on clause written into Forest’s agreement with Newcastle.",
      "Forest owner Evangelos Marinakis will set the club’s valuation of their star midfielder, which could rise over £100m. Speaking about Anderson recently, Newcastle icon Alan Shearer said: \"It [Anderson’s exit from Newcastle was the best thing. Although it was tough for Newcastle and it wouldn't have happened if it wasn't for PSR.",
      "\"But it was the best thing that happened to him, to get out and play. He wasn't going to get in Newcastle's midfield. You've got to give him credit. He wouldn't be far away now [from getting in Newcastle's midfield], I agree with that.",
      "\"He wouldn't have been able to do what he has done and is doing at Newcastle. Good for him. I'm delighted for him. He's gone from being a bit-part player at Newcastle to being one of the main guys at Forest and one of England's.\"",
      "Meanwhile, England boss Thomas Tuchel recently hailed Anderson as one of the most effective midfield players in the Premier League. He said: \"Anderson is a key player for us at the moment. He is one of the best midfielders in the Premier League - that's why he is with us and starting for us.",
      "\"He deserves it because he has been nothing but impressive. He has to keep on going now though. He is a very complete and mobile midfielder, and that's what he keeps showing me.\"",

      "Old Trafford chiefs already tested the water for Brighton's £100million-rated Carlos Baleba back in August and the Cameroon international remains on their wish-list. That's alongside Nottingham Forest star Elliot Anderson, who's set to be a key part of England's midfield at the 2026 World Cup.",
      "Should United get their way and sign both players, there'll no-doubt be repercussions for those who are already part of Amorim's squad, particularly the midfielders. Amorim has relied on a duo of Casemiro and Bruno Fernandes for most of this season, very much a short-term fix.",
      "Casemiro's contract expires in June while Fernandes hasn't ruled out a move away. Therefore, Amorim's midfield could look drastically different this time next year.",
      "Judging by United's plan to sign not one but two midfielders, it'd be a surprise to sign Casemiro to a new contract. The Brazilian is one of their highest earners and 33, his time at Old Trafford is likely coming to an end.",
      "Even if he were to stay by signing a short-term deal, likely on significantly lower wages, Baleba and Anderson would eat up most the minutes and prevent Casemiro from playing as regularly. The former Real Madrid stalwart certainly still has something to offer Amorim but he doesn't fit the profile of player which United are after.",
      "Although Fernandes has hinted that he'll re-evaluate his future after the World Cup, extra options in midfield would allow the United captain to play in a more natural role further forward. Fernandes, 31, is currently being used in a deeper position and isn't able to put up the same volume of of goals and assists that we're used to.",
      "But with Anderson and Baleba behind, he'd have license to play in one of Amorim's two No.10 slots and strut his stuff in the attack. That's if the Portugal star he stays, of course.",
      "Which midfielders should Manchester United sign next summer? Let us know your picks in the comments section.",
      "On the surface, Mainoo is an obvious loser in this scenario. The 20-year-old is already out of favour under Amorim and wanted to leave on loan before the end of the last summer window.",
      "Mainoo would be pushed further down the pecking order by Anderson and Baleba's arrivals - but could that actually be a good thing for him? Surely then United would sanction his departure and their academy graduate can begin a new chapter away from his boyhood club, where his career has stalled.",
      "Similarly to Fernandes, Mount hasn't been used in his natural position all that often by Amorim. His intelligence and work rate mean that he's a capable midfielder in the Red Devils' system, but the ex-Chelsea man will believe that he can offer a lot more.",
      "With the No.7 on his back, Mount will be hungry for goals and assists in a more attack-minded role at Old Trafford. Being used higher up the pitch - and potentially without Fernandes to compete with - could be what he's been waiting for.",
      "Despite thriving under Amorim at Sporting Lisbon, Ugarte hasn't been good enough at United. Still yet to acclimatise to the Premier League, the Uruguayan finds himself struggling for regular game-time like Mainoo.",
      "Like after his move to Paris Saint-Germain, Ugarte hasn't hit the heights expected of him and he'll be a candidate to leave Old Trafford as soon as January. Amorim reportedly slammed the 24-year-old in the wake of last season's Europa League final, criticising his efforts and accusing him of getting comfortable following his big move to Paris in 2023.",
      "How could we forget the manager? It's been reported on multiple occasions that Amorim wants more athleticism in his midfield, hence targeting Anderson and Baleba.",
      "The addition of two Premier League-proven players would be ideal for the Portuguese, whose stuttering rebuild is starting to show signs of life. With Anderson 23 and Baleba 21, Amorim's midfield future-proof and put them on track for long-term success.",
      "Finally, a player who Amorim took a liking to last season. Collyer regularly featured in United's matchday squads and across his 13 appearances, glimpses of the 21-year-old's talent could be seen.",
      "Now on loan at West Brom, Collyer is gaining experience and hopes to return to Old Trafford with a genuine chance of being a starter. But the signings of Anderson and Baleba would change the landscape and he'll face an uphill battle to stake his claim.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Manchester United midfielder Bruno Fernandes has delivered the perfect boost for his club following a sensational display for Portugal in World Cup qualifying on Sunday.",
      "Following their surprise loss against the Republic of Ireland last week, Portugal desperately needed a commanding performance to book their spot at next summer's tournament. They delivered emphatically with a 9-1 demolition of Armenia in Porto, with Fernandes amongst two players to net a hat-trick on the evening.",
      "This follows worries about the United star's condition during the previous international break, when he picked up a yellow card in the 2-2 stalemate with Hungary and was consequently ruled out of the Ireland defeat through suspension.",
      "At the time, the Portuguese media criticised Fernandes' showing and indicated he displayed signs of \"physical fatigue\", which would certainly have troubled Ruben Amorim and United's backroom team.",
      "Sharpness and fitness will prove vital heading into the winter schedule after the international break, and it could be suggested that Fernandes has satisfied both requirements during his time with Portugal since club football was temporarily halted. While it may not have been ideal for his national side, the fact that United's skipper didn't feature in the loss to Ireland means he's had less game time on his legs.",
      "Considering the concerns over physical exhaustion just a month ago in Portugal, a night off will have done wonders for the United midfielder.",
      "Fernandes' form is another positive, as he put on a top-notch performance during Sunday's match against Armenia.",
      "The Portuguese team secured their spot at next summer's World Cup with an all-round five-star display, but Fernandes' hat-trick will have boosted his confidence no end.",
      "Two of his goals came from penalties - one in each half - while his second goal was scored from open play, thanks to a well-timed pass from Goncalo Ramos that split the Armenian defence.",
      "Fernandes will now head back to Carrington, ready for a crucial series of matches that United should be able to win.",
      "Their first game back is against Everton on Monday Night Football, followed by clashes with Crystal Palace, West Ham, Wolves, Bournemouth and Aston Villa in the lead up to Christmas.",

      "There were several players from the academy sent on loan to gain experience. Some of those youngsters are excelling, while others have not made the impact they might have hoped. United loaned 18 players in total - and here is how they are faring this season.",
      "Sheffield Wednesday have been hit with a 12-point deduction due to their ownership situation, but they were able to promise regular game time to Amass, who has made 11 starts. The youngster scored his first senior goal against Southampton and United are delighted with his stint so far.",
      "Collyer was limited to seven substitute appearances after his arrival. He broke into the starting team against Millwall last month and retained his role in the next game, but he picked up a muscle injury.",
      "Ennis spent the second half of last season with promotion-winning Doncaster Rovers. The youngster joined Fleetwood on a season-long deal for this campaign and he has started eight league games. Has contributed two goals and an assist during his positive loan spell in League Two.",
      "Gore picked up an injury shortly after signing for Rotherham last January, but he made a strong impression in the time he was available, so he was re-signed for this season. Gore has been crucial for Rotherham in midfield. Has started in 15 games in League One and has been one of their best players.",
      "Onana has received praise in the Turkish media since his move to Trabzonspor, who have lost just once in the league from a possible eight games since he signed. The 29-year-old has recorded three clean sheets and helped Trabzonspor to third in the table.",
      "After missing the opening two games of the League Two campaign due to a minor injury, Harrison started the next four games for Shrewsbury Town before reporting for England Under-20 duty in September. In his absence, another young goalkeeper came into the side and has earned first-choice status over Harrison.",

      "Defender Aljofree started the first eight games of the campaign and notched a goal but he has lost his starting role over the last few weeks. The 20-year-old was not in the squad for Notts County played Harrogate Town last weekend.",
      "Solihull Moors are midtable in the National League. Jackson started in their first two games of the season, but he has struggled to make the XI since. The centre-back has been absent from their last five matchday squads.",
      "Hojlund made an excellent first impression in Naples, scoring twice against Sporting Lisbon in the Champions League shortly after his arrival, but he has scored just four goals in total. Hojlund has copped some flak from the Italian media for his recent performances. Napoli won Serie A last season but sit fourth.",
      "Kana-Biyik recently scored his first senior goal. He salvaged a point for Lausanne in a local derby and was called up to France's Under-20 squad for the November international break.",
      "Moorhouse has made 15 appearances for League One side Leyton Orient, but just four of those have been league starts. The youngster has shown glimpses of quality from the bench.",
      "Dave Hughes, who coached Ogunneye in United's academy, has just departed Newport County. That might impact Ogunneye's role in the squad, but the youngster has made 13 league starts in League Two so far and gained valuable experience, albeit in a struggling dressing room.",
      "Barcelona seemed a great fit for Rashford to rediscover his form. The United academy graduate has contributed six goals and nine assists in 16 appearances this season, and has looked back to his best.",
      "Rashford has been revitalised by leaving on loan - but Sancho continues to be in a slump. The winger has not started for Aston Villa in the Premier League and has failed to record a goal or an assist.",
      "Vitek has started every league game for Bristol City in the Championship, keeping five clean sheets. The 22-year-old has made some great saves. Bristol City manager Gerhard Struber recently said of Vitek to the Bristol Post: “He’s young, and he looks like an outstanding, experienced Championship goalkeeper.”",
      "Wheatley needed to leave on loan after outgrowing academy football. The young striker has made 13 starts in League Two for Northampton and has found the back of the net twice, as well as recording two assists.",
      "Williams is performing well north of the border. Has contributed a goal and three assists in nine appearances in the Scottish top-flight for Falkirk, who are exceeding expectations by sitting fifth in the table.",

      "The midfielder became the first British-born South Asian to represent Manchester United and the first to play in the Champions League. Iqbal came off the bench against Young Boys in December 2021 and at that stage in his career it looked only a matter of time until he was handed more regular opportunities.",
      "Chances may not have materialised at Old Trafford but Iqbal and his Iraq team-mates have a significant one tonight. A win against the United Arab Emirates in the home leg of their World Cup qualifying play-off will keep alive the dream of qualifying for the tournament next summer.",
      "Iqbal, who was the first Iraqi to play for United, came off the bench in last week's first leg, which ended 1-1 and leaves Iraq as marginal favourites to progress. Should they prevail they will enter a six team inter-continental play-off in March. Their world ranking is likely to see them go straight into one of the two finals and thus one win away from the World Cup.",
      "For Iraq that would be a first appearance since their sole qualification in 1986. For Iqbal it would be the latest piece of history and perhaps vindication for opting to leave United and move to Utrecht in the Netherlands.",
      "The tipping point for the now 22-year-old was a lack of opportunities and a seeming lack of trust from then manager Erik ten Hag in granting him a first team chance during the 2022-23 campaign.",
      "\"I thought I would get a chance and unfortunately I didn’t,\" said Iqbal in an interview last summer. \"I just wanted 10 minutes off a bench to show myself and it really frustrated me that the gaffer didn’t seem to rate me enough to give me a chance to show if I could sink or swim.",

From the outside, it looked amazing to all my friends because I was training and travelling with United’s first team. For me, it was mentally tough because I was just training and not allowed to play with the Under-23s. I thought to myself, 'I'm just like a number'.",
      "\"I was supposed to start a cup game against Charlton. I was in all the shapes and patterns in pre-match training. I was starting as a 10 and Lisandro Martinez came up to me and said: 'Now's your chance'. He talked to me and said, 'all of us are supporting you. Just show yourself, you're a good player. We're going to fight for you, make sure you're ready to fight'. It motivated me and it was nice from him, an aggressive leader in the team, a big player. I got tickets for family and friends to see me. Finally, my chance.",
      "\"Then I got to the stadium, looked at the whiteboard and didn't see my name. I was gutted. Then I thought I'd come off the bench. Nothing. That was the turning point for me. I didn't feel the manager respected me enough to play me.\"",
      "Iqbal turned down the chance to play at the Under-19 World Cup in April 2023 after Ten Hag told him he wanted to retain him as part of the United senior squad, but no club minutes followed and that summer he left for the Netherlands for a fee in the region of £1million.",
      "Injury has hampered his opportunity for regular minutes in Holland but he is closing in on 50 senior opportunities for the club and is a regular for the national team, scoring a crucial goal in a victory over Indonesia earlier this season. He'd love another against the UAE this afternoon (4pm), it would be the latest chapter of a history-making career.",

      "Manchester United head coach Ruben Amorim will be eagerly awaiting news on Benjamin Sesko's injury ahead of the clash with Everton.",
      "Joshua Zirkzee is the only other senior forward available to Ruben Amorim, but he has been on the fringes of first team action this season.",
      "United could be without Sesko for the visit of Everton next Monday, so how will they line up if the Slovenian is not fit?",
      "If Amorim continues to overlook Zirkzee when naming his starting XI, United will adopt a strikerless system against Everton. This could see Noussair Mazraoui retain his place at right wing-back with Amad in the No.10 role. Bryan Mbeumo could then move across to the left with Matheus Cunha leading the line in a 'false nine' role.",
      "This would give Mazraoui some more much-needed minutes having been eased back into action by Amorim following an injury. It also pushes Amad into a more offensive position, with the Ivorian having struggled with the defensive side of his role at right wing-back at times.",
      "However, if Everton play with a low block at Old Trafford, having an attacking outlet like Amad at right wing-back might be a good option. If he does start in that role, we can expect to see Mason Mount brought back into the starting XI to play alongside Mbeumo.",
      "Amorim is a big fan of Mount and he has so far managed to avoid any major injury concerns this season.",
      "United have looked impressive when playing in a strikerless formation at times this season and with plenty of options for Amorim to choose from, Sesko's absence might not be felt as harshly as you'd expect if he is ruled out.",

      "Modern football is often a reflection of the world surrounding it.",
      "When the older generations were watching the sport in the 1960s and 1970s, discussions surrounding the mental stability of a player or the squad was rarely aired. However, as the world became more aware of the challenges of mental health, football has accepted it and now each Premier League club takes into account the psychological fortitude of a player during every aspect of their career - all the way from scouting to the day they depart.",
      "Manchester United are no exception and within their current squad there are two players who are facing mental challenges which shall be putting them to the test. First, is Lisandro Martinez.",
      "Little more than a year after suffering a severe foot injury, the Argentine damaged his ACL and has been sidelined since February. He is now back with the United camp as he continues his recovery and his return to the pitch is expected before the festive period.",
      "But managing to navigate past the mental barrier of returning to professional football will be the crucial step in Martinez's recovery. Specialist in psychology at Manchester Metropolitan University Dr Martin Turner, who has worked with The FA and Scarlets Rugby, believes the 27-year-old could come back a stronger athlete.",
      "\"I imagine he [Martinez] will be worrying that it [his injury] would happen again,\" Dr Turner told MEN Sport. \"That is just sensible. That is just the reality.",
      "\"What you wouldn’t want a player like that to do is delude themselves that this will never happen again and everything is always going to be hunky-dory because sport is so unpredictable, and there is so much uncertainty that you can never really predict what is going to happen.",
      "\"But having gone through two quite difficult injuries, he will have learnt quite a lot and his personality and character would have had some shifts. From my experience of working with athletes who have especially had these back-to-back injuries and even sometimes surgeries, they do develop a shift in their personality.",
      "\"I wouldn’t say it is necessarily more resilience, but there is clarity there of what this means to them. They suddenly have a gratitude and thinking of: ‘Well, this could go away at any minute, so I am going to apply myself doubly compared to what I was doing before. I am going to really take care of this and do all the right things.'\"",
      "\"You can’t put it to one side and say that is done now because there will be monitoring that takes place after training and after performances around that injury and around recovery to make sure that everything is going well.",
      "\"There will be physical limitations because it will have been a long time since they have played to the intensity of a proper game.",
      "\"So it is not just a case of putting it to the back of your mind but about trusting the medical professionals you are working with to know that they would not let you step on this pitch, if you wasn’t physically right. Players have to take confidence from that and trust the people they are working with and then they can trust their bodies.\"",
      "Martinez's teammate Bryan Mbeumo is currently negotiating a different type of mental challenge heading out of the international break. Last week, Cameroon lost to DR Congo in World Cup qualifying meaning Mbeumo's national team will not be competing in the USA, Mexico and Canada next summer.",
      "Missing out on the World Cup, arguably the pinnacle of football, will have been a bitter blow for Mbeumo to take but Dr Turner believes that United do not have to fear the forward's confidence dropping upon his return to England.",
      "\"I am not sure they would have to do, or do anything special there,\" he explained. \"Experienced players are able to lift themselves, really, and move on quite quickly. One of the good things about football in particular is how quickly things move from game-to-game.",
      "\"Say you play badly and then you play well in the next game, it is sort of completely forgotten. Things move on so quickly so he would be expected to come back and hit the ground running and get his club mentality on.",
      "\"I think the direction of football, particularly in this country, is more of a club mentality and it is realised that is your bread and butter. I wouldn’t foresee any issues there and I wouldn’t expect staff to do anything in particular for that player.",
      "\"I might be wrong and I have no idea what is going on behind the scenes, but from my experience of being in environments like that, it would be an expectation to get back on your feet and go again.",
      "\"The more that you make a big deal of something that has happened or bring it into the room, the more that is going to affect other players so you have got to get him back moving, playing and within the mentality of the squad.\"",

      "Hello and welcome to our Manchester United transfer news live blog on Tuesday, November 18.",
      "With January fast approaching, rumours surrounding some big names are starting to whirl and United will almost certainly be involved. The newest of those involves Antoine Semenyo with it made clear just how much his release clause is and the likelihood of a winter exit from Bournemouth.",
      "Strengthening in midfield remains a priority for Ruben Amorim and after a failed pursuit of Carlos Baleba last summer, Nottingham Forest star Elliot Anderson is firmly on radar. The Brighton star is still of interest to those at Old Trafford, but Anderson is also a serious option.",
      "Crystal Palace's Adam Wharton is another name to have been linked while Joao Gomes of Wolves is an intriguing alternative that could be available in less than two months.",
      "With all of that being said, MEN Sport has you covered for all the latest transfer talk and you can stay up to date through all of it by following along below!",
      "Manchester United outcast Jadon Sancho appears destined to depart the club at the end of his contract next summer, but there is a scenario in which he moves on permanently in the January transfer window.",
      "CaughtOffside have claimed that 'discreet but meaningful discussions' have been held between Sancho's representatives and figureheads from Turkish league clubs Fenerbahce, Galatasaray, and Besiktas during the international break.",
      "Their report has added those talks took place at a luxury hotel and while it is unclear which team presented their long-term plans the best, it has been stated that Sancho would be willing to take a pay cut.",
      "The 25-year-old, currently on loan at Aston Villa, is earning more than £13million per-season.",
      "Manchester United face a big decision over whether or not to recall Elyh Harrison from his loan at Shrewsbury Town with the young goalkeeper having lost his place to Will Brook.",
      "United are following Harrison's situation at The Croud Meadow. The 19-year-old is highly regarded and Shrewsbury landed his signature due to their game time assurances.",
      "Almost every academy player who leaves United on loan has a recall break clause that can be activated after six months, which gives a chance to assess whether it's best for the youngster to stay on loan",
      "Manchester United could sign Antoine Semenyo for just £15million more than they were willing to pay this past summer.",
      "According to the Telegraph, Ruben Amorim's side and Tottenham saw £50million moves turned down by Semenyo, who went on to sign a new and improved contract at Bournemouth.",
      "A £65million release clause is in that fresh deal with United having the chance to pay it by a set date in January or part ways with less if he remains at the Cherries until next summer.",
      "Adam Wharton of Crystal Palace features on Manchester United's three-man transfer shortlist of midfielders.",
      "ESPN has claimed they are eyeing several midfield talents with Wharton joined by Brighton star Carlos Baleba and Stuttgart's Angelo Stiller. Nottingham Forest's Elliot Anderson is another option.",
      "The report suggests there is no plan to sign a midfielder in January which could rule out a move for Wolves' Joao Gomes.",
      "Marcus Rashford's wish to play at the Camp Nou is set to be granted after Barcelona announced their imminent return to the stadium.",
      "The Manchester United loannee has been in fine form with six goal contributions arriving in his last five matches.",
      "His happiness in Spain has come despite not being able to play at the club's iconic ground due to a £1.3billion refurbishment. Barcelona haven't played at the Camp Nou since 2023 and have instead hosted matches at the Lluís Companys Olympic Stadium.",
      "However, a return to the stadium is now in the pipeline for the Catalan club, who announced that they will play at the Camp Nou on Saturday when they welcome Athletic Bilbao.",
      "\"It’s a very nice feeling,\" Rashford said when discussing his experiences at the ground. \"It’s a beautiful stadium and when it is full it’s going to be unbelievable.",
      "\"Camp Nou was always one of my favourite stadiums and one I wanted to play in. But to play on it for Barcelona is going to be a different feeling. I cannot wait to be on the pitch. I will enjoy it.\"",
      "An update has emerged on Benjamin Sesko's injury after the striker handed Manchester United a scare earlier this month.",
      "The Slovenia international missed his nation's latest games with it now confirmed exactly how long he could miss.",
      "Alongside Antoine Semenyo, Wolves' Joao Gomes could be on the move in the January transfer window.",
      "The Brazil international has been in and out of the team at Molineux this season and with Wolves appearing destined for relegation, he could look to jump ship in the winter trading period.",
      "According to Record Portugal, he is under consideration by United for a January move with the player also not ruling out a mid-season switch. It has also been noted that he would cost around £44million.",
      "Given the timing, his quality and the immediate improvement in midfield depth he would offer Ruben Amorim, that is not a bad price at all.",
      "Despite Manchester United transfer updates involving Joao Gomes and Elliot Anderson, Brighton's Carlos Baleba remains their primary midfield target.",
      "According to transfer guru Fabrizio Romano, Baleba is keen on joining United with the club and his agents having a good relationship. The Cameroon international was pursued by those at Old Trafford last summer but no move materialised.",
      "His performances have dipped somewhat in the current campaign with Fabian Hurzeler reguarly taking him off at half-time. However, he appeared back to his best in the goalless draw against Crystal Palace earlier this month.",
      "Elliot Anderson is another name of interest to several Premier League clubs, but there is no chance of Nottingham Forest selling in January, according to the Telegraph.",
      "The 23-year-old midfielder has enjoyed a sensational rise over the last 14 months which has resulted in transfer interest emerging even though he only left Newcastle in the summer of 2024.",
      "It has been added in a recent report that Forest value him at over £100million with bids expected to arrive following the conclusion of the 2025/26 season.",
      "The biggest transfer news story in the Premier League at the minute is undoubtedly Antoine Semenyo.",
      "Having made such a brilliant start to the season with Bournemouth, links to the likes of Liverpool, Arsenal and Tottenham quickly emerged with United also interested.",
      "And one of those teams could have him on their books as early as January despite the fact he signed a new contract this past summer. That is because, as per the Athletic's David Ornstein, Semenyo has a £65million release clause with the Cherries potentiall powerless to stop him leaving in a few months.",
      "Their report has added that the sum must be triggered by a set date. Clubs could opt to return for him in the summer especially with it noted the clause will then be cheaper.",
      "Hello and welcome to our Manchester United transfer live blog right here on MEN Sport!",
      "For the latest updates and rumours on Antoine Semenyo, Elliot Anderson, Carlos Baleba, Joao Gomes and much more, follow along for the remainder of the day!"

      "Earlier this month, Manchester United fans were left scratching their heads as one of their best players this season was snubbed again.",
      "Luke Shaw endured a tough start to the season, following on from a campaign ruined by injuries. The 2024/25 season did not go according to plan for anyone in red, but Shaw in particular was being doubted after another season spent mainly on the sidelines.",
      "However, full credit must go to Shaw for the manner in which he has bounced back.",
      "Following the disaster at Manchester City, Shaw has been dependable for the Reds this campaign in a back three. He had to deal with plenty of criticism following that derby day defeat - notably from Roy Keane - and after addressing it, he set about making amends.",
      "Ever since that game, Shaw has got better and better for United and you can see him settling into his new role on the left side of defence. That's why it was surprising when England head coach Thomas Tuchel overlooked him for the final World Cup qualifiers this month.",
      "While being overlooked for selection will have been a blow to Shaw, Ruben Amorim will have taken the positives from the decision. He admitted himself, from a selfish perspective, he wanted all his players to be training and recovering at United during the international break. But he would still be delighted to see Shaw competing with England.",
      "\"For me, I want him to go to the national team, but I also want Luke Shaw to train with me, recover with me, and be prepared for my game, so I'm a little bit selfish on that, so if he's not going to the national team, for me it's fine, because I can control better what he's doing,\" Amorim said earlier this season.",
      "While missing out on the November camp was a big blow for Shaw, Tuchel has admitted it is not necessarily the end of his World Cup dream. \"First of all, it's my job now to make contact with everyone,\" the England head coach said at the end of the Three Lions' final international break this year.",
      "\"Players like Trent [Alexander-Arnold], players that are on our long list, 55, 60 players, to reach out to them, be in touch with them, explain to them why they were not here. Explain to them what they have to do, where they can improve.",
      "\"Can they even do something or is it just a choice, so this is my job in the next weeks and months.\"",
      "Shaw and Harry Maguire will be on Tuchel's list of 55-60 players who he is in contact with to discuss their spots in the England squad.",
      "That phone call should work to United's benefit. Shaw will know exactly what he needs to do over the next few months to put himself in contention and that can only help United.",
      "Shaw will be eager to show Tuchel that he was wrong to overlook him. The best way to do that will be to impress for Amorim and the Reds.",

      "Manchester United centre-back Matthijs de Ligt has admitted he is finding the five-at-the-back system under Ruben Amorim easier as time progresses.",
      "Amorim has been heavily criticised for his decision to stick with the five-at-the-back defence, with three centre-backs playing alongside two wing-backs. Some argued the Portuguese head coach needed to be pragmatic and revert to a traditional four-at-the-back system in order to secure results.",
      "Prior to the Burnley victory and with scrutiny mounting, the United boss told reporters: \"Guys, if I feel that it's best to change... I played all my life in the 4-4-2, 4-3-3. The only system that I didn't play one minute: 3-4-3.",
      "\"I just have one idea that we need to be so good in this way of playing, then we are going to adapt. It's like some coaches have a mentality that I'm going to put this system, and then I'm going to change.",
      "\"What I'm thinking is that we have one system that is going to adapt to different systems, and then when everyone is doing this with his eyes shut, I'm going to change a lot of things.\"",
      "United are on a five-game unbeaten run and sit a point outside the top four. Integral to this recent form has been De Ligt, who has started every Premier League match for Amorim this season.",
      "On Monday night, he played the full 90 minutes alongside Liverpool's Virgil van Dijk in a back four as the Netherlands beat Lithuania in their final World Cup qualifier to top their group. After the game, De Ligt was quizzed on his preference and the 26-year-old insisted that he does not have one.",
      "\"No, I don't really have a preference,\" he told Flashscore. \"We play with a five-man defence at Manchester United, but on paper, we defend with four.",
      "\"It didn't feel awkward today; it felt the same as always. I can play in both systems. I'm more experienced with a five-man defence now; the more experience you have, the easier it gets.\"",
      "In the last match before the November international break, you could see De Ligt's point in practice. United would often drop to a back four with Luke Shaw moving into central midfield.",
      "The Netherlands have now qualified for the World Cup and De Ligt expressed his delight post-match to have made his first start for his country since last November. \"Whether it's a comeback? Yeah, a bit,\" he admitted.",
      "\"I wasn't here last time, I haven't started for a long time, so I'm delighted with today. The season is going well so far.",

      "Former Premier League referee Mike Dean has rejected accusations of bias against Manchester United from Anthony Taylor, as the quality of refereeing in the top flight was brought into the spotlight.",
      "The Cheshire referee was appointed as the official for United's encounter against Liverpool last year, casting fresh light on the 47-year-old's association in the North West. Taylor supports Altrincham, of the National League, and grew up in the town, which led to some complaints regarding his appointment for matches involving both United and Manchester City.",
      "At the time of his appointment for last season's United vs Liverpool game, ex-Premier League referee Keith Hackett said: \"I do not understand why Anthony Taylor has been given the Liverpool game against Manchester United and I do not think he should be doing it.\"",
      "Expressing worries for the referee's personal safety, the former referee added: \"There is a risk to his personal safety and that of his family after the game if something was to go wrong. That is not right. The fact he lives so close to Old Trafford means he has been put under unnecessary pressure and it could have been avoided if the game had been given to another referee from the Select Group.\"",
      "Despite being on the border of Greater Manchester, the elite referee has overseen numerous clashes between the two North West rivals in recent seasons.",
      "His involvement in City and United's matches was brought up again this week during the Overlap's Fan Debate, but Dean was quick to shut down any suggestions of officiating prejudice towards any Premier League side and defended his appointments for their matches.",
      "\"I get where you're coming from and Anthony [Taylor] is from Altrincham, he has supported them. He does Man United against Liverpool,\" he said during an appearance on the Overlap's Fan Debate.",
      "\"Having said that, Liverpool fans never complained when I officiated them and I'm a Tranmere fan. I get where you're coming from and there could be a bit more thought in that.",
      "\"Sometimes, unfortunately, the best refs that we have live in certain areas, so there's nothing you can do.",
      "\"You're not going to have Man City vs Liverpool refereed by a guy who has only done one or two years in the Premier League, whether it's Oliver, Brooks or Kavanagh. It was like when Stuart Attwell done a game at Everton and gave a penalty, did someone complain?\"",
      "United icon Wayne Rooney interrupted with a surprising claim that Taylor has trained with United before and is actually a good player. He said: \"He’s a good player, he’s trained with us a few times… he actually did.\"",
      "According to PGMOL regulations, referees must not take charge of matches involving teams they support. Altrincham club president told The Athletic previously: “Anthony has always been an Altrincham fan.",
      "\"Even now, he gets a season ticket every year, despite the fact he can’t go to all the matches. People around here always ask if you’re a Red or a Blue. He’s actually a great advocate for non-League football and should be praised, not criticised.\"",

      "His happiness in Spain has come despite not being able to play at the club's iconic ground due to a £1.3billion refurbishment. Barcelona haven't played at the Camp Nou since 2023 and have instead hosted matches at the Lluís Companys Olympic Stadium.",
      "However, a return to the stadium is now in the pipeline for the Catalan club, who announced that they will play at the Camp Nou on Saturday when they welcome Athletic Bilbao.",
      "They revealed that a license was granted for their return with over 45,000 fans allowed to enter the ground to watch the action. The statement read: \"FC Barcelona informs that the match corresponding to matchday 13 of the League, against Athletic Club, scheduled for Saturday, November 22 at 16:15 hours, will finally be played at Spotify Camp Nou.",
      "\"This decision comes after obtaining the first occupancy license corresponding to Phase 1B, which allows increasing the capacity up to 45,401 spectators. This authorization includes the entire Lateral area and adds to the license already granted for Phase 1A, which covers the Tribune and South Goal.",
      "\"The Club continues working on Phase 1C to guarantee the resumption of activity in the North Goal, gathering all operational, security, and comfort conditions for members and fans.\"",
      "Representing Barcelona in their legendary stadium was a dream Rashford admitted he wanted to make true, and he did so earlier this week in an open training session ahead of Saturday's clash.",
      "Discussing his experience playing at the ground, he said: \"It’s a very nice feeling. It’s a beautiful stadium and when it is full it’s going to be unbelievable. Camp Nou was always one of my favourite stadiums and one I wanted to play in. But to play on it for Barcelona is going to be a different feeling. I cannot wait to be on the pitch. I will enjoy it.\"",
      "The renovation of the stadium is expected to be finished in 2027 where their capacity will rise to 105,000, making it the the fifth largest overall stadium in the world.",
      "In terms of Barcelona's plans for the rest of the season, the club made a request to UEFA to change their designated home ground back to the Camp Nou for the rest of their Champions League campaign.",
      "Rashford has racked up a team-high 15 goals and assists in 16 games across all competitions this season, with Barcelona just three points behind Real Madrid in La Liga.",

      "Benjamin Sesko could miss up to eight Manchester United fixtures with the extent of his knee injury now being revealed. The summer signing was forced off in the 2-2 draw against Tottenham with multiple updates emerging over the November international break.",
      "Slovenia head coach, Matjaz Kek, initially suggested no communication had arrived from United ahead of their game against Kosovo while also making it clear the national team deserved respect.",
      "Defeat in that clash meant Slovenia and Sesko won't be at next summer's tournament in the United States with Kek delivering another update which made his thoughts perfectly clear on several topics.",
      "\"Completely expected from the English media,\" he said in reference to his comments being exaggerated. \"But I emphasise - once again - the moment communication was established between us and the Manchester United medical team, the problem was solved in five minutes.\"",
      "The general basis of that conversation was likely to confirm he would not be available, with United also set to be without their No.30 for a few weeks - at the very least. The Athletic have claimed that Sesko is set to miss around one month with a knee injury.",
      "Their report has also noted that depending on how his rehab goes, the 22-year-old could miss anywhere between three to five weeks. If it's the former, Sesko would likely miss games at Old Trafford against Everton and West Ham United alongside trips to Crystal Palace and Wolves.",
      "United will be hoping that Sesko is back available from that date with key attackers Amad and Bryan Mbeumo heading to AFCON to represent Ivory Coast and Cameroon, respectively.",
      "Prior to Sesko being forced off at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, Harry Maguire and Casemiro were both also substituted, but look to have avoided injury. The latter has since played and scored for Brazil while Maguire, who had pulled up clutching his hamstring, has been spotted working hard in the gym.",
      "Long-term absentee Lisandro Martinez is also closing in on a welcome return, but it's likely he will be carefully managed having not featured since February.",

      "Ex-Premier League referee Mike Dean has boldly backed Wayne Rooney's claim of foul play surrounding Manchester City's 2012 title triumph. The former top-flight official has revealed that there were elements of QPR's performance against City that were surprising after they survived the drop.",
      "Manchester United needed to beat Sunderland at the Stadium of Light in order to keep pressure on Roberto Mancini's side, and the Reds knew they would win the league if City slipped up. United kept their side of the bargain as they overcame the Black Cats 1-0, and with the scores level in the North West, Sir Alex Ferguson's side were set to become Premier League champions.",
      "However, Sergio Aguero raced through, firing past Paddy Kenny to create the memorable title win.",
      "Rooney has been vocal over the years there was something not quite right about how City claimed the title, with QPR learning of their own safety from relegation while the game was still going on. There has never been any proof, though, of any intentional wrong-doing from QPR.",
      "Dean, who was in the middle for the game between City and the west London club, did reinforce Rooney's belief, however, as he described certain aspects of the game as \"strange\".",
      "\"It was one of those games, as all the referees that week when the appointments came out, we all wanted that game,\" he said.",
      "\"I couldn't believe I had the game, to get the game, the stakes and how it went. We always knew United were going to beat Sunderland, the way it transpired, we all thought City would win and it went the wrong way.",
      "\"What was strange about it, we elude to the end of the game but once QPR found out they were safe, I spoke to Clint Hill about it, once they knew they were safe, Jamie Mackie is on the pitch celebrating while the game is going on.",
      "\"They make it 2-2 and they just kick it back, and we were like, 'what's going on, why are they giving the ball back straightaway?' I said [that] in the ear piece.",
      "\"It was a strange one. To kick off and give the ball straight back to them. Neil Swarbrick, the fourth official, said, 'Keep switched on, something is going to happen.' You just knew something was going to happen. You could just tell.",
      "\"But I still can't get my head around why they kicked the ball straight back, I just couldn't... I don't know.\"",
      "Rooney added: \"They had loads of ex-City and Liverpool players in the team, I know Joey tried his best. But Djibril Cisse came out and said he was celebrating with City after it. Here's another charge.\"",
      "Former United striker Rooney has previously taken aim at some of the QPR players for their role in denying United another title under Sir Alex. Back in April, he said: \"Obviously that was a tough one that.",
      "\"But again didn't Paddy Kenny turn the ball in, two goals, QPR knew they were safe and City get it to 2-2, then they just boot the ball back to them.",
      "\"They had (Djibril) Cisse on the pitch, Joey Barton got sent off for acting stupid. Who else was it, Shaun Wright-Phillips and Nedum Onuoha diving about.\"",
      "Barton, however, has categorically denied any foul play on QPR's part. Speaking on the Common Sense podcast, he said: \"Sometimes people tell you stuff and you want to believe it because it fits your narrative; 'We didn't win the league because there was an agenda against us!'",
      "\"It might be the same fellas who say, 'If you get one more hair transplant it might grow back this time, this might be the time you get a fringe'. As you've found out, that is complete nonsense. Stop wasting your time on nonsense.",
      "\"The game at Man City was not thrown. Man City won the league, Man United never. Am I happy? Abso-f******-lutely because I hate Man United. But I didn't go out of my way to make City win the league. We were intent on QPR staying up, so to say me, Djibril Cisse, Shaun Wright-Phillips, Nedum Onuoha, or Paddy Kenny have somehow concocted to make sure you don't win the league is b*******. You should've got yourselves in a better position.",
      "\"Man City had to beat QPR on the last day at home, who are in the bottom four, to win the league. That's your fault. The fact you even had a sniff is a testament to QPR and the battle they put up because that was an easy f****** win for City.",
      "\"You wouldn't have f****** made them score two in injury time. You've won a load of leagues Wayne, but that wasn't a conspiracy that got away from you. That was just a f****** mad result on a mad day.\"",

      "Ruben Amorim has been told that Antoine Semenyo would take his Manchester United side to the 'next level' Semenyo, 25, has scored six goals and registered three assists in 12 Premier League games this season, helping Bournemouth make an impressive start.",
      "Since Jason Wilcox took over as sporting director, United have prioritised signing players with Premier League experience, as demonstrated by the arrivals of Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo. The club have also shortlisted players such as on Elliot Anderson, Carlos Baleba, Joao Gomes and Adam Wharton, further evidence of their new mandate.",
      "Semenyo was on United's radar this summer, with reports claiming that Amorim met him for a meal in London. The forward's stock has increased since then, sparking interest from Liverpool and Tottenham.",
      "On Monday, it emerged that Semenyo has a £65million release clause that can be activated in January. Despite the Ghana international signing a five-year contract extension in July, Bournemouth would be powerless to stop him if he wanted to leave.",
      "The cause is active for the first two weeks of January, allowing United the chance to sign Semenyo and steal a march on their rivals. According to former Arsenal and Manchester City defender Bacary Sagna, they should take that opportunity.",
      "\"Looking forward, if he was to leave Bournemouth and stay in the Premier League, I think Manchester United would be a suitable option for him,\" Sagna told Oddspedia. \"He could definitely help the club get back to the top end of the league and if he did join them, he'd be regarded as the player which made the difference and take United to the next level.",
      "\"He's young, fresh and has proven he can shine in big games this season - so I think Old Trafford could be a good destination for him.\"",
      "Nevertheless, Sagna believes that Semenyo would be best off rejecting a move in January. \"If I was Antoine Semenyo, I would stay at Bournemouth until the end of the season,\" the Frenchman added.",
      "\"As a player, moving clubs in the January transfer window can be disruptive; it's much better to stay until the summer and then make a decision, and integrate into the team properly - rather than joining midway through a campaign.\"",
      "Semenyo will get the opportunity to showcase his talents at Old Trafford when Bournemouth travel there on 15 December. The 25-year-old scored as the Cherries won 3-0 in the same fixture last season.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "The loan spell to Catalonia was the last throw of the dice for Rashford. His bridges were burnt with Ruben Amorim and, for all involved, the best thing to do was to let him leave.",
      "Rashford wanted Barca in January but an approach was not deemed viable by the La Liga giants. Fortunately for the United academy graduate, they returned in the summer and the deal was done.",
      "He joined the Camp Nou club on a season-long loan with the option to purchase him in the summer. If all goes according to plan for United, Rashford will impress, Barca will trigger that option and the winger's time in Spain continues.",
      "Six goals and nine assists in 16 appearances suggests Barca will want to keep Rashford. Whether they have the finances to do it is another issue. Barca can sign the England international for £28m in the summer but the financial pressures Barcelona face are well documented.",
      "No matter how well Rashford does at Barca or for England, he will not have a place to come back to at Old Trafford. Amorim has made his mind up and therefore the task would be to find him a new club.",
      "Kitbag has slashed the price of Man United kits and merch with up to 50% off select items.",
      "With that in mind, United know what they can't do. Sell Rashford to a Premier League rival. In Spain, El Nacional has reported that Chelsea and Tottenham Hotspur have both made early contact with Rashford's agent to try and persuade him to move to the Premier League. United can't let that happen.",
      "If he was to impress in the Premier League, suddenly Rashford becomes a more prominent issue for the United head coach. So ideally United must find a way of making things work with Barca. The alternative of him returning to England with Chelsea or Spurs is not worth thinking about.",
      "United can only hope that if it comes to it, Rashford still does not fancy a move down to London...",

And the midfield maestro turned the clock back as he scored in a 2-0 friendly win over Senegal at the Emirates Stadium on Saturday.",
      "He and Chelsea winger Estevao each contributed as the Selecao continue to make progress under former Real Madrid chief Ancelotti. And the response from Brazilian media suggests United star Casemiro will indeed have an important role to play at the 2026 World Cup.",
      "The major question for United fans is whether that will be as a United player, with Casemiro's contract due to expire next summer. The club hold the option to trigger a 12-month extension to his stay, and Casemiro has been making a strong case despite his eye-watering £350,000-a-week salary.",
      "News outlets in his home country have nevertheless been raving following his impressive performances for his national team this season, with his latest display showing he \"has evolved\" at a late stage in his career while also becoming his side's \"main leader\" ahead of next summer's World Cup.",
      "\"There is no longer any reason to divide the midfield, as was done in Brazil in recent decades, between the number five, number eight and number 10 shirts,\" read one report of the win against Senegal in Folha de Sao Paulo. \"They blend together. As Klopp, former Liverpool coach, said, more important than a good, classic number 10 is recovering the ball closer to the opponent's goal.",
      "\"Even better is having both options, the pressure and the star player, which happens in many teams. There is still room for midfielders who play more centrally and further back, who protect the defence and initiate offensive plays with excellent passes.",
      "\"They are the links between defence and attack. Great teams have this type of player. Casemiro, who has always stood out from midfield back, has evolved and is now a great playmaker.\"",
      "The 33-year-old has shown that in spades of late, having collected three goals and one assist in his last four outings for club and country. Casemiro, who was recalled to the Brazil squad by Ancelotti after a two-year hiatus, is expected to contribute in more areas for United than he was during his days at Real, and that has helped redefine his importance at both levels.",
      "After securing a new role as a playmaker in Ancelotti's side, it also appears the midfielder could well be heading to the World Cup with a starting spot following his latest impressive performance.",
      "\"But it was the creative and attacking players of the Brazilian national team who were the protagonists of last night,\" read an excerpt of Globo's report. \"Increasingly in sync, Casemiro and Bruno Guimaraes are consolidating themselves as the starting midfield duo for the World Cup.",
      "\"Since Ancelotti's arrival, both have demonstrated a good ability to alternate in chasing down opposing midfielders and participating in the build-up to attacking plays.\"",
      "Correio Braziliense piled on with their praise by suggesting Ancelotti has indeed found his preferred formula: \"Casemiro, one of the few remaining players from the last World Cup and the team's main leader alongside Marquinhos, sealed the result. Both goals were scored in the first half, a period in which the Brazilian team was flawless.",
      "\"The presentation suggests that Ancelotti has found a starting line-up. Or at least he's close to it. It's quite likely that the 11 who started the match in the English capital will be at the World Cup. And that some of them will be starters at the World Cup hosted in Canada, the United States and Mexico.\"",

      "Manchester United goalkeeper Senne Lammens has received the seal of approval from club legend Sir Alex Ferguson following an impressive run of form.",
      "The 23-year-old shot-stopper joined the Red Devils from Belgian side Royal Antwerp for just over £18million toward the end of the summer transfer window. Since then, he has established himself as the first choice under Ruben Amorim, starting each of the last five games.",
      "While he has kept only one clean sheet in that time - a 2-0 win over Sunderland - three victories mark a significant improvement on the start of the season and have lifted United to seventh in the table, just a point off the top four.",
      "Having missed out on Europe altogether after a dismal league finish last term, reclaiming their place near the top of the table is imperative for Amorim’s side this season.",
      "So far, so good for United, as Ferguson believes the signs are encouraging in light of recent results. Praise rarely comes higher from a United perspective, given what the Scot achieved during his lengthy tenure, and he has been particularly impressed by Lammens as well as Bryan Mbuemo and Matheus Cunha.",
      "“There are signs, the manager has had some good signs,” Ferguson said in an interview with Raceday RTV. “Particularly the goalkeeper - he’s been outstanding. He’s only played three or four games and he’s looking really good.",
      "“Of course, Mbeumo and Cunha, the new players from Wolves and Brentford, have added to it. I hope the manager gets a bit of success because at United you need to have success - and the signs are getting better.",
      "“I think back-to-back wins is something teams like United should always expect. But having gone through a cycle where improvement requires patience, they’ll enjoy it now.”",
      "The goalkeeper position has been something of a problem area for United in recent years following the departure of David de Gea in the summer of 2023. Andre Onana was initially signed as his replacement for a hefty £47 million from Inter Milan, but despite some positive moments, the Cameroon international never fully convinced as United’s long-term solution.",
      "Amorim handed Turkey’s Altay Bayindir an opportunity at the start of this season to stake his claim, but he too struggled to convince, prompting United to return to the transfer market. Now, just a few months into his time at the club, Lammens already looks like a smart piece of business and someone capable of making the position his own.",
      "After the international break, United face a crucial run of fixtures in the build-up to Christmas, with winnable matches against the likes of Everton, Crystal Palace, West Ham, Wolves, Bournemouth and Aston Villa. With full focus on Premier League football, climbing the table and breaking into the top four will be Amorim’s priority in the weeks ahead.",

Reflecting on the conversation he had with the legendary manager ahead of the release of his new book Pass Master, O'Brien told Chronicle Live: \"I didn’t expect him to be impressed with the news I had to tell him.",

      "Ruben Amorim has enjoyed a turnaround at Manchester United after an awful start to the campaign.",
      "United crashed out of the Carabao Cup second round against Grimsby Town and were hammered 3-0 by Manchester City, which cranked up the pressure on Amorim.",
      "Amorim had not won back-to-back Premier League games since his arrival, but the United boss enjoyed an outstanding October, winning three games on the bounce against Sunderland, Liverpool and Brighton.",
      "Here are how the players have rated so far this season:",
      "Senne Lammens",
      "The bar was low to impress between the sticks, but Lammens has made a huge impact since his strong debut against Sunderland. The Belgium international has made a supremely confident start to life at Old Trafford, and the \"are you Schmeichel in disguise?\" chants tell you how he has performed. 7",
      "Altay Bayindir",
      "It was only a matter of time before Bayindir lost his first-choice status. He made a mistake against Arsenal on the opening day of the campaign and another error against Burnley at Old Trafford. Made some good saves against Brentford at the Gtech Community Stadium, but still conceded three. 5",
      "Luke Shaw",
      "Has started every Premier League game on the left side of the back three. Shaw was poor in the Manchester derby, but he bounced back against Chelsea in the following week and hasn't really put a foot wrong since then. His passing has been a huge asset from the back. 7",
      "Harry Maguire",
      "Maguire started on the bench for the first four games of the campaign. Technically recorded an assist against Chelsea and scored the matchwinner at Anfield. Maguire has produced some memorable moments during his United career, but he will look back on that goal with particular fondness. 7",
      "Matthijs de Ligt",
      "De Ligt has markedly improved this season. He is showing the kind of form that saw him earn a reputation as one of Europe's best defensive prospects, and he is delivering consistent performances each week. He is still the only United player to have played every minute in the Premier League. 8",
      "Leny Yoro",
      "Yoro has started seven league games this season. He has been substituted off in five of those matches, with Amorim reshuffling his defensive line in the closing stages of contests. Looked to have scored for United at Craven Cottage in August, but it was marked down as an own-goal. 6",
      "Diogo Dalot",
      "It's been a mixed bag for Dalot this season. Has recently been asked to play at left-wing back, and he didn't look comfortable in that role - he is better on the right - against Sunderland and Nottingham Forest. Was dropped to face Tottenham last weekend. 5",
      "Patrick Dorgu",
      "Dorgu looked sharp in pre-season and started the campaign full of confidence, but he has delivered some unconvincing performances and his end product around the box must improve. Dorgu did not start once during United's excellent run of three wins on the bounce throughout October. 5",
      "Noussair Mazraoui",
      "Has played just over 200 minutes across five appearances this season due to injuries. Mazraoui performed well against Spurs last weekend and it felt harsh to remove him before the hour mark. 6",
      "Ayden Heaven",
      "Heaven started against Grimsby in August when Blundell Park felt like hell. The youngster has made just two substitute appearances in the league, but he provided an assist in the 4-2 win against Brighton. 5",
      "Casemiro",
      "Has become hugely important this season. United have conceded five goals when Casemiro has been on the pitch and 15 when he has been off it. Also contributed goals against Chelsea, Brighton and Nottingham Forest, so he's been one of the standout performers. 8",
      "Bruno Fernandes",
      "Fernandes' performance against Tottenham encapsulated his season so far - he was poor but played the corner into the box for the equaliser. Has scored two goals and recorded three assists in total, but missed penalties against Fulham and Brentford. Could easily go up another level. 6",
      "Mason Mount",
      "Looked bright without scoring when starting the first three matches of the campaign. Scored brilliantly to open the scoring against Sunderland and was industrious against Liverpool. 7",
      "Manuel Ugarte",
      "Was far too weak when allowing Wilson Odobert to breeze past him for Tottenham's first goal last Saturday. Ugarte was off the pace against Grimsby and has struggled when introduced from the bench. 3",
      "Kobbie Mainoo",
      "Mainoo has not really made a negative or positive contribution due to his lack of involvement. Was absent against Spurs due to a knock, and hopefully that injury is nothing serious. 5",
      "Amad",
      "His relationship with Bryan Mbeumo has blossomed as the season has developed. He assisted Mbeumo against Liverpool and Tottenham, and scored a stunning goal against Forest to salvage a point. Has delivered strong performances from right wing-back. 7",
      "Bryan Mbeumo",
      "Mbeumo is the current favourite to win the Sir Matt Busby Player of the Year award. The Cameroon international was unstoppable before the international break and he was named the Premier League Player of the Month for October. Six goals in 12 appearances for United. 8",
      "Matheus Cunha",
      "Has made a big impact since his arrival and scored his first goal for the club against Brighton, but Cunha would have liked to have more goals and assists to his name. 6",
      "Benjamin Sesko",
      "Sesko started on the bench for the opening three Premier League games of the season. He made his debut against Manchester City in September and notched his first goal against Brentford. Built on that by scoring against Sunderland, but has failed to fire since that game in early October. 5",
      "Joshua Zirkzee",
      "Can't mark Zirkzee higher or lower than a five - he hasn't started once. 5",

      "An update has emerged about Joshua Zirkzee's future at Manchester United amid continued speculation as the January transfer window approaches.",
      "United signed Zirkzee from Bologna in the summer of 2024 in a deal worth €42.5million (£37.5m). The Netherlands international moved to Old Trafford after being signed by former manager Erik ten Hag, but Zirkzee has found game time difficult to come by since Ruben Amorim's appointment 12 months ago.",
      "Zirkzee has made just five appearances for United so far this season, four of which have come in the Premier League, and he is yet to score his first goal of the campaign.",
      "Amorim has yet to name Zirkzee in the starting line-up in any match so far this term, with the striker being left as an unused substitute on seven occasions in the top flight.",
      "As a result, there has been frequent speculation linking Zirkzee with a move away from United during the January transfer window.",
      "However, The Sun have reported that this will not be the case as Zirkzee looks set to remain at Old Trafford. It has been claimed that the 24-year-old has \"no chance\" of leaving United in the New Year.",
      "The report claims that the upcoming Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON), which will be expected to see Bryan Mbeumo, Noussair Mazraoui and Amad Diallo be unavailable for several weeks, is influencing United's decision-making for the January window.",
      "It's because of this that Zirkzee has reportedly been told that a transfer in January will not be possible, with the expectation now that the forward will get more game time across December and January.",
      "Various reports have been claiming for some time that Zirkzee would seek a chance to leave United in January in search of more regular first-team football, but if the latest article is accurate then that may not be possible.",

      "Manchester United's Shea Lacey has long been touted as a star of the future - and it might not just be at club level.",
      "The 18-year-old has caught England's eye in recent weeks and months and again played a starring role on the international stage this week.",
      "The United prospect came off the bench to score for England Under-20s in their 1-1 friendly draw with Japan on Friday night, having only made his debut at that level last month.",
      "That outing came after the teenager was called up to train with the Under-21s - who beat Ireland 1-0 on Friday - where he received glowing praise from boss Lee Carsley.",
      "\"He's been in the pathway a good amount of time now and he's a player that we rate highly,\" said Carsley.",
      "\"It worked out well that we needed that position for the training we were doing and Shea was more than happy to come over and train with the Under-21s. You can see he's a good talent.",
      "\"I know he's struggled with injuries in the past, which has probably held back his development, but I think it's so important we don't rush these young players, we let them develop in their own time. I think he trained two sessions with us and I enjoyed having him.\"",
      "In October, Lacey spent time training with the England senior squad under the watchful eye of boss Thomas Tuchel when he was drafted in from age-group sides to assist ahead of the friendly win over Wales.",
      "His international showings are reward for a strong start to the season with United at Under-21 level. He's got five goal contributions in eight games across the Premier League 2 and EFL Trophy, while he was one of a clutch of youngsters who were alongside the senior group when United returned to pre-season training in the summer.",
      "The playmaker had an injury-hit campaign last term and was carefully managed as a result. His minutes at academy level were therefore limited, but he did travel on the post-season tour to Asia and was handed a senior appearance off the bench in the defeat to ASEAN All-Stars.",
      "That offered a glimpse of what he can offer, with his ability on the ball evident. Lacey, who featured for United's Under-18s aged just 14, signed a professional deal at the first opportunity last year and Old Trafford insiders believe he has the potential to break into the first team.",
      "At this rate it might one day be for club and country.",
      "Kitbag has slashed the price of Man United kits and merch with up to 50% off select items.",

    "body": [
      "Casemiro made a beeline for Ruud van Nistelrooy in the Old Trafford tunnel on his return with Leicester City in February.",
      "Van Nistelrooy, a fluent Spanish speaker, was the conduit between Casemiro and Erik ten Hag after his Portuguese-speaking assistant Mitchell van der Gaag left. Van Nistelrooy started Casemiro in all four of his matches as caretaker manager. Casemiro lingered as Van Nistelrooy spoke, as attached to him as a comfort blanket.",
      "At that time, Casemiro had not started for United in 39 days. He did not get a kick between December 30, the night of the Newcastle United debacle, and January 30. He emerged on 70 minutes in Bucharest with United 2-0 up. The transfer window was still open but the chances of United shifting Casemiro were, like the Trinity test igniting the atmosphere, near zero.",
      "People at United's Carrington training complex noticed Casemiro's personality never wavered during a trying first half of the season. They have always found him to be a warm presence.",
      "His transformation at United in the past two months has been as unexpected as their 3-0 triumph in Bilbao. This is the midfielder who was dropped for last year's FA Cup final and replaced by Toby Collyer with United 2-0 down to Liverpool at half-time eight months ago. Casemiro’s declaration that he was keen to see out his contract in March was framed as more bad news for the club.",
      "Casemiro used his head before Athletic lost theirs in San Mames. Returning to Spain emboldens Casemiro. In San Sebastián and Bilbao, he has reminded Spanish audiences he can still cut it nearly three years on from leaving their shores. United supporters serenaded Casemiro on Thursday night.",
      "The draw with Real Sociedad in mid-March has marked a late turning point in Casemiro's third season in Manchester. With Manuel Ugarte out injured, Ruben Amorim had little choice but to turn to the older defensive midfielder.",
      "Casemiro has since been a fixture in the United starting XI, his importance highlighted by the early withdrawal at Bournemouth last week to preserve him for Bilbao. Ugarte admitted this week he is copying him.",
      "Within a matter of months, Casemiro has gone from unsellable to undroppable. If or when United reach the Europa League final, Casemiro is a shoo-in in midfield. The 3-4-2-1 system Amorim swears by has closed the yawning gaps that developed between the defence and midfield under Ten Hag and Casemiro has the safety net of a third centre back.",
      "United have adjusted Casemiro’s running and pressing triggers. “I think he has improved a lot also,” Amorim opined. “You can see not the way he plays but the way he runs. You can see it, we have the data to show him where he worked really hard.",
      "“He is a very good example. Even Toby sometimes was playing in front of him and [that] it is hard to take for Casemiro. So it is a lesson for all the players in Manchester United.",
      "“No matter what is the past or the last month, everything can change in one moment. Then we understood that he cannot jump all the time pressing high. We need to let him understand and sometimes it is better to put three defenders and let him be the fourth defender and put the wing-backs pressing high. These are all things we are understanding and trying to cope with all the criticisms of the team. But the credit is for Casemiro.”",
      "Amorim has been impressed by how hard Casemiro has worked to meet his demands to regain his place in the team. He noticed that he never complained during those winter weeks warming the bench.",
      "Selflessness is a natural trait of Casemiro's. It was also his undoing this time last year. With United depleted at centre half, he dropped back and was humiliated in the 4-0 drubbing by Crystal Palace.",
      "With Kobbie Mainoo and Christian Eriksen a flimsy shield and Jonny Evans his creaking partner, Casemiro abandoned his position to engage Michael Olise, overcommitted, lost his balance and Olise scored. Six days later, he trundled out of the United third and played Arsenal winger Gabriel Martinelli onside to square for Leandro Trossard’s tap-in. Sofyan Amrabat was ushered back in from the cold and played his way into the FA Cup final XI.",
      "Jamie Carragher urged Casemiro to “leave the football before the football leaves you”. Casemiro had been pencilled in to flank Amorim for pre-match press duties against Athletic and he would be a worthy choice at Carrington next week. He is a positive story again and one of the squad’s figureheads. United view Casemiro as a quiet leader, mind.",
      "The 33-year-old shared Raphael Varane’s view that a “disconnect” had developed between the players and Ten Hag. It is not a coincidence that Casemiro scored two goals in the first game after Ten Hag was finally sacked. He was committed enough to claim the last goal of the Ten Hag era at West Ham.",
      "When Casemiro discussed the possibility of joining United, he wanted to know three things: where he would live, where he would train and where the stadium was. During FaceTime conversations, he requested to see the club’s gymnasium at Carrington.",
      "United sources have been struck by how leaner Casemiro is this season. People in Madrid said Casemiro used to be in the club's Valdebebas gym at 8am and he often has gym sessions before and after training at Carrington.",
      "Casemiro has struck up a close rapport with some of the masseurs and his English is now a very good level of conversational. He understood our questions in the mixed zone two years ago, when his handshake grip was as tight as a vice. Casemiro's wife, Anna, and children Sara and Caio, are happy in Manchester amid the prospect of a fourth year in England's north west.",
      "Staff at Carrington regard Casemiro as one of the most respectful players they have encountered and that he is strident in protecting the club's image. Sir Jim Ratcliffe dubbed Casemiro as \"overpaid\" and \"not good enough\" in March. Three days later, Casemiro trumped his first-leg performance against Sociedad in the 4-1 win at Old Trafford.",
      "His steep decline over 18 months - dropped for Amrabat, substituted for Collyer, omitted from the Brazil squad - makes Casemiro’s revival so singular. If United win the Europa League it would be churlish to argue someone who has won three trophies in three seasons has been an unsuccessful signing.",
      "Casemiro drove United to a successful 2022-23 season. Without him, they would not have qualified for the Champions League. Ten Hag dubbed him the “cement between the stones”, essentially the glue in the team. Casemiro was central to the Latino rebranding of the United defence that kept the most clean sheets in the Premier League.",
      "Casemiro has returned to that level of influence he wielded in his first season. In Europe, at least. The concern if United do not triumph in Bilbao again this month is Casemiro could be redundant in a campaign devoid of Champions League midweeks. His recent domestic form has been inoffensive but not stellar and United need a young and dynamic new central midfielder in the summer.",
      "The senior figures made the difference in Bilbao, though. Casemiro and Bruno Fernandes, two 30-something Portuguese speakers, are naturally close.",
      "“We've got a lot of senior players who need to step up in their moments,” Harry Maguire explained. “I think Case was brilliant tonight. Bruno as well. So we have senior players who need to handle these moments really well.”",
      "Van Nistelrooy, a champion of Casemiro’s, merits credit for that.",

At times I think Liverpool have maybe been a bit too risky with the three midfielders going forward when it’s probably not on. I think they do need that little bit of stability in front of that back four.”",

      "Manchester United are not going to be able to sign Adam Wharton from Crystal Palace in the January transfer window, sources have told TEAMtalk, amid speculation that the Red Devils have already ‘submitted’ a ‘bid’ for the midfielder that manager Ruben Amorim ‘loves’.",
      "It has been well-documented that Man Utd are on the hunt for a midfielder in the January transfer window, as Amorim aims to take advantage of the team’s promising results of late to make a serious push for the Premier League top four this season.",
      "Sources have told TEAMtalk’s transfer correspondent, Fraser Fletcher, that Nottingham Forest star Elliot Anderson is Man Utd’s top midfield target in January.",
      "TEAMtalk understands that Man Utd are confident of getting a deal done for Anderson for £60million (€56.8m, $65.5m).",
      "However, the Red Devils are not putting all their eggs in one basket, with Crystal Palace midfielder Adam Wharton also on Man Utd’s wish-list, as reported by Fletcher on September 23.",
      "A report emerged on November 17 claiming that Man Utd have submitted a bid for Wharton, with manager Amorim claimed to love the 21-year-old England international.",
      "The account on X, which has almost 700,000 followers and is run by a ‘team of five elite reporters’, wrote at 6pm: ‘My contact at the club are telling me that bid has been submitted for Adam Wharton.",
      "‘Ruben Amorim loves the player and believes he can sell the project to Adam before Liverpool contact the player.’",
      "While this rumour has to be treated with caution, given that no other media outlets have reported it, TEAMtalk’s transfer insider, Dean Jones, has revealed that the “information” that he has been given from sources is that Palace will not sell Wharton in the middle of the season.",
      "When asked if Palace could sell Wharton in January,  Jones told TEAMtalk: “There are no signs of it happening. I just don’t think deals like this are going to happen in January.",
      "“I would love to be able to reveal there was going to be a huge battle to sign him in a mega-money transfer, but all the information I have had on it just doesn’t lead to that.",

      "He’s in our Premier League team of the season so far, but he’s behind Bart Verbruggen (and probably Mark Flekken) with the Netherlands, though his move to – and outstanding subsequent form in – the Premier League did at least earn him a first call-up in September. He’s been sat on the bench ever since.",
      "",
      "Yes, he of the long throw and the being really quite excellent for Brentford. He has been extensively capped by his country at Under-18, Under-19 and Under-21 level but remains uncapped for actual Italy, which might be a blessing considering the absolute sh*t-show going on there.",
      "",
      "It’s really quite astonishing that Botman remains uncapped while his lofty Newcastle United teammate Dan Burn is merrily collecting England caps. But Botman faces some very, very tough Premier League competition in Virgil van Dijk, Micky van de Ven, Nathan Ake, Jan Paul van Hecke and Matthijs de Ligt.",

He’s roughly 25 injuries away from a call-up.",

But there is still a chance after he re-established himself as Fulham’s first-choice left-back. And England do have a left-back problem. And this uncapped XI had a left-back problem because Rico Henry went and played nine minutes for Jamaica.",
      "",
      "Very, very expensive for an uncapped player but City paid a January tax on Nico, who had represented Spain at every level bar the big one. He did not make himself indispensable in his first few months in England but he has proved to be a very valuable member of the City squad, starting and scoring in a dominant performance as they battered Liverpool 3-0.",
      "",
      "“He had an excellent Euros and won the title, Lee [Carsley] was full of praise and he did an excellent job in midfield with Elliot Anderson, who is now a regular starter for us. He was very impressive and then he took another step and has become a very regular starter for Bournemouth.",
      "“They are in the top third of the league, overperforming constantly, and he is a starter for them. He puts the intensity in and gets his minutes, so we thought this was the perfect time to reward him, get to know him and see what he can bring to our team.”",

      "There was A Clamour in March but Tuchel resisted, with Nwaneri fast-tracked into the England Under-21 set-up instead, and he is now firmly established in Lee Carsley’s starting XI. Unfortunately, Arsenal minutes are a little harder to come by after serious summer investment and he has found himself in the Carabao Cup team with Myles Lewis-Skelly. He could yet play for England but it feels a long way away now.",
      "",
      "A move away from Liverpool was supposed to bring more minutes and a greater chance of an England call-up, but Elliott has struggled to understand Unai Emery’s quite specific tactics at Villa and remains very much on the fringes there. Thankfully, there is so little competition for England in the No. 10 role, that he should walk straight in when he’s ready…",
      "",
      "He’s yet to log a Premier League goal or assist but he has at least established himself as one of four or five wide options at Chelsea, with the Carabao Cup win over Wolves providing something of a breakthrough moment.

      "World Cup qualification is very nearly over and with just a handful of games left to play before the play-offs in March, we bring you the top 10 Premier League players of a campaign which for some nations started way back in September 2023.",
      "Here’s who’s already qualified and here’s what’s next for Republic of Ireland and the other play-off hopefuls.",
      "And here’s a Premier League XI of players yet to be capped.",
      "",
      "10) Declan Rice (Arsenal and England)",
      "There’s a degree of crowbarring an England player in here, and with Premier League judas Harry Kane not available for selection, we’ve plumped for a man described by Lee Dixon on Sunday – with no hint of irony or any notable nod to Alan Partridge – as “the very best corner-kick taker on earth”.",
      "Only one of Rice’s four assists actually came from a corner, but two more from crosses, and while our guess is Mr Dixon’s assertion is largely based on televised Premier League and Champions League games, he is indeed a very fine courier of a football.",
      "",
      "9) Mohamed Salah (Liverpool and Egypt)",
      "A brace against Djibouti in October served as quite the moment of positivity amid the club-level sh*t for Salah, as the Egypt captain secured their place at the World Cup while also becoming the top goalscorer in African qualifying history with 20 to his name.",
      "His nine across the 2026 campaign was only bettered by Algeria’s Mohamed Amoura. Arne Slot may well take nine from him across the 38-game Premier League season on current form.",
      "",
      "8) Cody Gakpo (Liverpool and Netherlands)",
      "More Premier League goals and assists combined (5) than any Liverpool player this season and yet he’s still seen as a weak link by most, who would much rather have Luis Diaz back despite Gakpo going toe to toe with the Colombian for a starting spot last season. We suspect Gakpo would have Liverpool fans looking on just as wistfully had it been him who had made the move to Bayern Munich in the summer.",
      "And he’s got four goals and four assists for the Netherlands having started every World Cup qualifier under Ronald Koeman, taking his career tally to 19 goals and 10 assists in 46 games for his country. For context, Bukayo Saka has 14 goals and nine assists in 48 games for England.",
      "",
      "7) Mikkel Damsgaard (Brentford and Denmark)",
      "Those reading this north of the border will hope Damsgaard’s place on this list doesn’t act as some sort of harbinger of doom ahead of Tuesday night’s showdown at Hampden Park. Some advice to Steve Clarke, if we may: stop Damsgaard; stop Denmark.",
      "He has three goals and an assist in five games, chiefly from the left wing but with the license to cut inside and combine with Christian Eriksen in a more central area, behind Rasmus Hojlund. He’s infuriatingly neat and tidy, and his increased influence for Brentford in the last year has built up a level of confidence that he’s now arguably showing to an even greater degree for his country.",
      "",
      "6) Enzo Fernandez (Chelsea and Argentina)",
      "He played and thrived for Argentina, and continued to be heralded as an undroppable star player, through thin times at Chelsea, and Fernandez remains a key cog in Lionel Scaloni’s team now that things are rather thicker for him at Stamford Bridge.",
      "His and Argentina’s zenith came in a 4-1 win over Brazil in March, after which the local press marvelled at his “near to perfect” display. The 24-year-old “dominated” the game playing as the closest midfielder to Julian Alvarez, often with his back to goal, linking the play with the sort of time on the ball only afforded to the most technically gifted footballers.",
      "He’s one reason Argentina are top of our World Cup power rankings.",
      "",
      "5) Jeremy Doku (Manchester City and Belgium)",
      "Doku had been grouped in a herd of not-quite-good-enough Manchester City forwards, and may even have been bringing up the rear behind Savinho, Oscar Bobb and Omar Marmoush before a season in which he’s shown a significant improvement that we’re as guilty as anyone in believing he would never make. We assumed he was destined to be little more than a kick-and-run winger forever.",
      "He comes across as a very intelligent guy in interviews and something of a sponge for advice, previously hailing Thierry Henry for telling him how to improve his number of goals and assists rather than just insisting on the need for an increase. Both Manchester City and Belgium are reaping the rewards of Henry’s suggestion he cut out the “stutters” in his dribbling and avoid thinking he has to beat his man to deliver a cross.",
      "Only Lamine Yamal (7.5) completed more dribbles per game than Doku (5.6), but the key to Doku’s place on this list and his status now as something at least approaching a complete winger is his 3.1 key passes per game, which is the 14th most in European qualifying.",
      "",
      "4) Manuel Ugarte (Manchester United and Uruguay)",
      "Just as none of us can believe Ugarte has ever shown quality worthy of a £53m move to Paris Saint-Germain and then a £44m move to Manchester United given the almost comically lacklustre displays we’ve seen of him in the Premier League, we imagine Uruguayan nationals are similarly perplexed as to how the guy they’re seeing cleaning up at the base of their midfield isn’t having a similarly dominant effect for the Red Devils.",
      "No player has won more than Ugarte’s 33 tackles in South American qualifying, with Moises actual Caicedo behind him in second on 27 having played more minutes, and no player has made more than Ugarte’s 29 interceptions. Incredible.",
      "It is very gratifying indeed to know that no matter the degree to which the floppiness of an Old Trafford flop appears to be down to the player and not the club, it is in fact always Manchester United that is the problem.",
      "",
      "3) Martin Odegaard (Arsenal and Norway)",
      "There’s something of the Wales 2016s about this Norway side in that they’ve got an outstanding goalscorer and playmaker of a similar standing and influence to Gareth Bale and Aaron Ramsey.",
      "Like Wales, there is talent elsewhere in the side. They had Ashley Williams, Ben Davies and Joe Allen. Norway have Alexander Sorloth, Sander Berge and Kristoffer Ajer. They’re no mugs and would have been an outside bet to qualify anyway, but those questioning whether they can make any sort of mark at the tournament proper without Erling Haaland should have similar doubts over an Odegaard-less Norway.",
      "His seven assists in just five games was the most of anyone in Europe and no-one created more than his five chances per game.",
      "",
      "2) Mikel Merino (Arsenal and Spain)",
      "He’s started all of Spain’s five games and played every minute of the first four, scoring six goals, including a hat-trick in the 6-0 away win against second-placed Turkey.",
      "After two goals and an assist against Bulgaria in October, Spain boss Luis de la Fuente hailed Merino as “an exceptionally complete player with great adaptability”. That versatility is arguably costing him at Arsenal – for whom he’s started just four Premier League games – as he’s neither one thing nor the other, very good at everything but not the best at anything, but he’s made himself undroppable for Spain, and is now always shoehorned into the team, shining whether as a No.8 or No.10.",
      "",
      "1) Erling Haaland (Manchester City and Norway)",
      "He’s now scored an absurd 55 goals in 48 games for his country, stretching his lead as Norway’s all-time top goalscorer dramatically through qualifying, with Jorgen Juve second on 33.",
      "Haaland would be 20th on the list through this World Cup campaign alone, with his 16 goals in eight games just one less than Morten Gamst Pederson managed in 82 appearances.",
      "He scored twice as many goals as anyone else in European qualifying – Harry Kane, Marko Arnautovic and Memphis Depay all scored eight – and is the top scorer in qualifying across all continents, including those where teams play twice as many games.",
      "“We’ve not had someone who’s been an outright superstar in the way that Erling is,” said Norwegian journalist Lars Sivertsen. “I think there’s already a case to be made that he’s our greatest ever player.”",
      "Paris Saint-Germain are lining up a deal to sign Man City superstar Erling Haaland in the summer transfer window, according to reports.",
      "Erling Haaland has been a Premier League player for barely three seasons but has already outscored a legion of legends and is firing Norway to the World Cup.",
      "Relegation via a guilty FFP verdict would lead to a Manchester City exodus, so we have ranked their 26-man squad based on exit likelihood in this scenario…",
      "Here are the 10 current favourites for the Premier League Golden Boot with Erling Haaland disappearing over the horizon already.",
      "It is easy to see why Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta is the way he is when you consider who and what dominated English football when he first joined.",
      "Pro-VAR Manchester City forward Erling Haaland being a robot is no longer a playful joke – it actually might be true…"

      "If you’re of a mind to discount Erling Haaland as an all-round footballer and still see him purely as a goalscorer despite plenty of evidence to the contrary this season, there’s a fair case to be made that Antoine Semenyo has been the Premier League’s best player this term.",
      "Semenyo’s six goals and three assists puts him second behind Haaland (14 goals; 1 assist) in the Premier League goal-contribution charts and the Ghanaian passes the eye test with flying colours with his wonderfully rangey running style and an astonishingly rare ability to be just as devastating off his left or right foot.",
      "Amid interest from Tottenham and Manchester United in the summer and Manchester United and Liverpool now, it’s a case of when and not if Semenyo moves on from Bournemouth, and The Athletic’s David Ornstein has revealed the 24-year-old looks set to leave the Vitality Stadium at the earliest possible opportunity.",
      "Only a week ago Fabrizio Romano claimed it was “very unlikely” that Semenyo would leave in January, but Ornstein now says the Cherries ‘reluctantly accept they may be powerless to prevent his exit’ in the winter window, with his release clause ‘formally set at £65m’.",
      "It would be a significant blow to Bournemouth, but they have arguably (and incredibly) improved having sold left-back Milos Kerkez, winger Dango Outtara and centre-back pair Dean Huijsen and Ilya Zabarnyi in the summer. And Ornstein added that the clause ‘must be activated by a specific date, which would give Bournemouth a couple of weeks to replace their best player’. Probably with another gem to be sold for huge profit in future.",
      "The revelation is sure to bring more suitors than Manchester United and Liverpool to Semenyo’s door as £65m is a very reasonable price for a player of that much ability whose ceiling we suspect is yet to come into view.",
      "It’s been claimed Liverpool would be Semenyo’s ‘top choice’ as he ‘wants to win the Champions League this season’, which is quite the flight of fancy. And if – as that report suggests – Semenyo is a man focused on the short-term, we would actually put Liverpool’s advantage over United in this fight down to their side being an altogether easier one to a) get into, and b) make a significant difference in.",
      "While we’re not convinced Arne Slot has the stones to drop Mohamed Salah, such is the inevitable impact his sulking would have on the dressing room dynamic, part of the problem with leaving him out is there being no obvious worthy replacement for him. Let’s face it, the Liverpool love-in for Federico Chiesa is far more about the song than the football.",
      "Semenyo walks into Liverpool’s starting lineup, in place of Salah on the right or on the left for Cody Gakpo, who’s been one of the Reds’ better players this season and is often picked out as a weak link when he’s in fact been the strongest, but doesn’t have the game-changing knack of Semenyo.",
      "Let’s be clear, the Semenyo we’re currently seeing gets in the United team too, just as he gets in every Premier League team, and would cement Benjamin Sesko to the bench if Ruben Amorim was to play him down the middle in a position he’s operated in before.",
      "But fast starts for Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo at Old Trafford means Semenyo’s inclusion in one of the inverted ten spots isn’t a formality, and is part of the reason why he wouldn’t have the transformative affect on United as he would on Liverpool, which really is quite something 11 games into the season after Arne Slot’s side doubled the Red Devils’ points tally in winning the title.",
      "Liverpool have been in ‘direct negotiations’ for two months with Bournemouth as they look to sign Antoine Semenyo, according to reports.",
      "Antoine Semenyo has reportedly told Bournemouth that Liverpool ‘is his top choice’ for a January transfer as he looks to win the Champions League.",
      "Liverpool have made an offer to sign Rodrygo ahead of the January transfer window as they continue to monitor Antoine Semenyo, according to reports.",
      "Manchester United are reportedly ‘preparing to move fast’ to land a star Premier League winger in January before Liverpool and other big clubs can get there.",
      "Liverpool have learned their chances of a blockbuster January move for Semenyo amid strong new claims that he asked to leave Bournemouth.",
      "Liverpool target Antoine Semenyo has reportedly asked to leave Bournemouth in the January transfer window after the Reds made an approach."

      "England completed a successful 2025 in enormously predictable fashion.",
      "Another couple of wins. Another couple of clean sheets. Another couple of Harry Kane goals that don’t count. Another Daily Mail hatchet job on Jude Bellingham. Just your bog-standard international break for England these days.",
      "We already knew before it they’d be off to the World Cup, but are we any clearer now as to which specific players will be doing so?",
      "Here’s the latest all-important F365 England Ladder, with October’s rankings in brackets – you can read the full thing here.",
      "As ever, the rules of the Ladder are that this is not our ranking, but our best guess at what we think Thomas Tuchel is thinking. And he can be a tricky fella to read, sometimes, but we do think we’re starting to get a clearer idea now of what makes him tick.",
      "Which only makes it funnier just how far off the mark huge swathes of this will be by March.",
      "",
      "The easy part of the Ladder is still easy. We’re not even pretending to shuffle him down to two or three just to feel alive. He is still England’s most important and least-challenged player.",
      "Even when Thomas Tuchel made a bunch of changes for the dead rubber against Albania, Harry Kane remained. Even when Thomas Tuchel made a bunch of second-half substitutions in the dead rubber against Albania, Harry Kane remained. And then scored the two late goals to complete the flawless qualification campaign. Because that is simply what Harry Kane does.",
      "He now has more international goals than Pele (without scoring a single one that counts), and his next England goal will lift him into the top 10 all-time for men’s international goals, level with Neymar and just behind Ferenc Puskas. Joining Cristiano Ronaldo, Lionel Messi and the legendary Ali Daei in the 100 club is now very, very possible.",
      "With Ollie Watkins struggling for form and fitness and absolutely nobody else seemingly even in the frame, it’s even now possible that Kane winds up the only specialist No. 9 in Thomas Tuchel’s squad, with your Marcus Rashfords and Phil Fodens and the Cole Palmers of this world providing potential back up as nines of varying degrees of falseness. Tuchel himself described such a scenario as ‘possible’ but unlikely.",
      "And, of course, even describing Kane as a ‘specialist No. 9’ is to traduce one of the world’s very best players, who is also a more than handy No. 10, No. 4, No. 6 and No. 8.",
      "It’s a bit of a shame he went in goal that time for Spurs in the Lamela Rabona game and answered the question of whether he could play there too with such an emphatic ‘no’, because otherwise we’d strongly suspect he could.",
      "",
      "His usual serene, game-running self in the win over Serbia, but was one of several players left slightly discombobulated by Thomas Tuchel’s experimental approach to the first half in Albania.",
      "We’ve absolutely no problem with anything Tuchel tried in that first half – if not then, when? – and even the 3-2-2-3’s near total failure to launch taught the manager and us something useful. And equally we’re not really perturbed by the players struggling to get to grips with it.",
      "This was an experiment Tuchel justifiably felt able to implement because things were going so well; it will only be seen again if things are going so wrong.",
      "Rice was back to his usual self in the more familiar shape deployed in the second half, and remains as indelibly inked-in and integral as ever.",
      "Mandatory comment here about set-piece delivery and its potential outsized importance for the nitty-gritty of a major tournament.",
      "",
      "Kept another facile clean sheet in the first qualifier of the break, taking his personal clean sheet streak for England to 10 games since the 2-1 defeat to Greece at Wembley in October last year.",
      "Thomas Tuchel still hasn’t seen Pickford pick the ball out of his net in any England game he’s managed, which is a daftness no matter the level of opposition.",
      "Amusingly, the almost sarcastically under-employed Pickford was then rested for the final qualifier in Albania, and got to sit back and watch Dean Henderson have more to do in that one game than he’d had in the previous seven combined.",
      "",
      "It was a while before Tuchel was able to call on Stones, but since then he’s been a fixture in the side and that tells you something.",
      "There are still some who argue he’s in a three-way battle for two starting spots with Marc Guehi and Ezri Konsa, but we’re increasingly convinced that pair are fighting to start alongside Stones.",
      "Whatever the truth of it, those three are now head and shoulders clear of anyone else in the centre-back conversation.",
      "Tuchel had spoken before about Stones’ midfield potential, and it was interesting – if not particularly successful – to see him try it out in that final game against Albania.",
      "",
      "Lovely goal against Serbia to deliver on a direct request for more goal contributions, and then came off the bench to set up the opener for Kane in Albania in what was a slightly curious half-hour cameo that featured one odd decision to try and tee up a team-mate when another goal appeared certain had he gone for it himself.",
      "Either way, still absolutely no reason to doubt he’s a certain starter on the right of England’s attack if all things are equal next June, despite the estimable competition provided by Noni Madueke and Jarrod Bowen. Both are enormously capable, neither is in Saka’s class.",
      "",
      "The speed with which Elliot Anderson has become the undisputed first choice in what was one of England’s problem positions alongside Declan Rice is pretty extraordinary. It really is only something that’s come about across this season’s three international breaks.",
      "Quietly impeccable again against Serbia at Wembley, and even earned (most of) a night off in Albania as Adam Wharton got his chance to impress.",
      "As ever, the Ladder is our estimation of the England manager’s position on players and when he talks we listen.",
      "“Elliot and Declan are at the moment ahead in midfield. They are a very good pair, and they complement each other very well.”",
      "We cannot argue with that, and have no desire to do so.",
      "",
      "Tuchel couldn’t help but – in our view unnecessarily – stir the pot with a bit of an OTT reaction to Bellingham’s pretty standard frustration at being substituted late on in Tirana, but the fact he got that start, the fact he was so eye-catching even when not at his best and, most importantly, the fact he is simply a better footballer than Morgan Rogers means we do now have just about enough evidence that when it comes to it and the real business begins next summer, Jude Bellingham will be England’s No. 10.",
      "It really is no slight on Rogers to suggest that by next summer the idea that six months earlier it was even a meaningful debate at all will look a bit odd.",
      "Still, though, this is based on what we think Tuchel is thinking and we’re still not entirely sure he’s as convinced this is a closed conversation as we are, so Bellingham’s upward movement remains conservative for now.",
      "But Bellingham is a generational talent and Tuchel absolutely knows this. Sorry, Daily Mail, there really aren’t ‘serious questions over his World Cup inclusion’ no matter how much that boils your hateful acrid p*ss.",
      "",
      "The eighth player we believe to be inked in to England’s starting XI for June, and the only reason he isn’t three or four places higher up the list is that even with the Ladder’s usual rules about assuming everyone is injury-free, we simply cannot even comprehend a universe where Reece James is reliably injury-free.",
      "Which is really bloody annoying actually, because he’s entirely and reliably excellent in every other way.",
      "",
      "Must have feared the worst when ruled out of this break through injury, but two things are true.",
      "First, when given the opportunity to select Gordon, Tuchel has generally selected Gordon.",
      "And second, neither Marcus Rashford against Serbia nor Eberechi Eze against Albania did enough to really suggest they can rip the starting shirt away from the Newcastle man.",
      "Also, when you think about it, the fact both Eze (against Serbia) and Rashford (against Albania) were far more impressive when coming off the bench to make a late impact only strengthens Gordon’s case to be the starter out of that trio.",
      "As far as missed international breaks through injury go, that was an absolute belter for Gordon. The team didn’t suffer any unpleasant consequences whatsoever, but nor did anything happen to remotely diminish his own standing and prospects. You’ll take that in the middle of such a busy season.",
      "",
      "Like Gordon, he was missing from this camp, and like Gordon it probably hasn’t done him too much harm.",
      "We thought he was in a straight fight with Ezri Konsa to start alongside John Stones, and we still think that after watching Konsa look very good against Serbia and Dan Burn look…not so good against Albania.",
      "At the very, very least his place in that group of top three centre-back options hasn’t been challenged, with Burn having a rough time and Jarell Quansah finally getting a debut but getting it in a weird and confusing right-back/right-centre-back-of-three hybrid role that didn’t really give him the best foundations upon which to attempt a bit of claim-staking.",
      "We think Tuchel slightly favours Guehi over Konsa, and don’t think we’re doing that thing where we project our own instincts on to the manager. Either way, if the sort of selection debate we’re worried about when the World Cup comes around is ‘Guehi or Konsa’ we will sleep easy in our beds knowing we don’t much care either way because it’s going to be absolutely fine. Given some of the scenarios we’ve had before, this one feels like extremely small beer.",
      "",
      "One of the key things we’ve learned about Tuchel thus far is that when you’re in, you’re in until you’re not. He’s already made it a feature of his selection methods as an international manager – worth remembering this is all new to him as well – that players who do the job for him will not be replaced just because some bigger or shinier name comes back in the fold.",
      "One exception to this, we think, is at left-back. It’s the one position where it feels like Tuchel really is still experimenting because he needs to, rather than resting players because he can or adapting to the availability picture in front of him.",
      "As such, we’re not quite willing to say that Nico O’Reilly’s pair of wonderfully assured performances in that position in this break have cemented his place. But it does now feel like his shirt to lose, even if that is pretty harsh on Djed Spence – who was exemplary on both flanks in October.",
      "Does feel like there’s still a fight here, though, one that your Lewis Halls and Myles Lewis-Skellys may yet have their say in as well.",
      "",
      "Had one particularly eye-catching moment when marshalling Dusan Vlahovic expertly against Serbia and as we’ve already said, we think he’s in a pretty close scrap with Marc Guehi to partner John Stones, and we are extremely comfortable with whichever way that particular cookie crumbles.",
      "His ability to do a very tidy job at right-back might, in a weird way, hurt his starting chances; in a major tournament you might not want to risk having to separate your starting centre-back pairing because Reece James is injured again.",
      "But that versatility absolutely locks down a squad place. We’re still very much in ‘on the plane’ territory here.",
      "",
      "Slips outside the starting XI now, we think. Is unlucky really to have Bellingham as his direct competition, and may eventually suffer from offering less squad-building versatility than other players who could potentially play at 10 but also offer options out wide, like Eberechi Eze or Cole Palmer or even Phil Foden.",
      "But he’s played better for England in that 10 role than any of those lads, and we know Tuchel values that enormously highly. He can have no complaints about anything Rogers has done for him, and while it wouldn’t enter our heads to do so it still wouldn’t entirely surprise us to see Rogers’ name on that starting team-sheet in seven months.",
      "As ever when discussing Rogers v Bellingham, we’re aware we can come off quite disparaging to the Villa man. We don’t mean to be. He’s excellent, we would be entirely unconcerned if England need to use him in tournament conditions. He played in every single game of what was a uniquely successful qualifying campaign for England.",
      "He’s just not Jude Bellingham.",
      "",
      "Had a busier game against Albania than Pickford has had against anyone in an England shirt this year, but for Henderson that’s probably a blessing. He actually got the chance to show Tuchel what he can do after being one of the players to suffer in the Senegal game, and kept a clean sheet that was nothing like the formality of so many of Pickford’s.",
      "There were smart saves and some good decision-making from Henderson. Nothing that has any chance of unseating Pickford as No. 1, of course, but the Albania game has absolutely solidified Henderson’s claim on first-reserve status, with James Trafford simply not playing any football and Nick Pope unfortunately ruled out after a hard-earned recall.",
      "",
      "If you’d told us a couple of years back that Jordan Henderson would be a Thomas Tuchel regular for England with a significant and clearly-defined role at his big age we’d have been so alarmed we probably wouldn’t even have registered our surprise at Thomas Tuchel being England manager.",
      "Now, though? We’re fine with it. He brings experience and leadership to the squad and his role within the squad is clear; he’s maybe fourth or fifth choice to actually start in central midfield, but absolutely first-choice sub to come on in there when there’s a job that must be done.",
      "",
      "Still seems like a straight fight between him and Anthony Gordon to start on the left for England and while it would be no surprise to see Rashford continuing to deliver the more eye-catching contributions at club level, where all his problems really do seem to have been solved by the one neat trick of simply joining one of the biggest football clubs on earth, we know how high a value Tuchel places on the work people have done specifically for him.",
      "And, given the opportunity in this window by Gordon’s injury setback, we’re just not sure Rashford did quite enough to shift the needle on the starting XI. Especially when he actually strengthened the idea that his best contributions might come from the bench by having his best contributions come against Albania, from the bench.",
      "",
      "Brilliant cameo from the bench against Serbia, drab performance from the start against Albania. Not sure exactly where that leaves us or more specifically Eze really, but overall probably roughly back where we started, which is: brilliantly talented, game-changing bench option anywhere across the attack but probably not really in serious contention for any starting position.",
      "We’re okay with it. Worth noting also that Eze, with three goals, was the only person not called Harry Kane to score more than once for England during this qualifying campaign. Feels like that definitely ought to count for something.",
      "",
      "We know Tuchel is a big Madueke guy, to the extent that if we take him at his word he wouldn’t even have recalled Bukayo Saka in October had Madueke not been injured himself.",
      "It makes him among the harder players to place in this Ladder, but we do think the only real option at this time is to go with Tuchel’s confirmed high opinion of a player who should be back fit and firing by the time the next squad comes around in March.",
      "Before his injury, Madueke was statistically perhaps the most important non-Kane attacker for England during this qualifying campaign, leading the way in both chances created per 90 and dribbles per 90.",
      "Second on both those metrics? Look away, Daily Mail, but it was that awful prick Jude Bellingham.",
      "But back to Madueke, it feels certain to us that Tuchel will at least give him a chance to reassert his claims to be at least first reserve on that right-hand side come March, and we’d be pretty confident at that stage that he would take that chance.",
      "",
      "Even further away from rivalling Kane for a starting spot than ever before – it really is mad to think now how the sight of Watkins replacing a lumpen and grimly ineffective Kane at the Euros was a source of such joy – but now finds his squad place under threat.",
      "Not from any other striker – don’t worry, Ollie, there aren’t any of those – but from the slim possibility that Tuchel might not bother with one at all.",
      "Given the paucity of the back-up options, sadly now up to and including Watkins himself, the magnificence of Kane and the multi-faceted nature of England’s great many other attacking talents, it becomes a tempting option.",
      "If you don’t have another No. 9 you’d really trust, but you do have, say, Phil Foden and Marcus Rashford and Cole Palmer, do you really need another No. 9 in there for the sake of it?",
      "We do still kind of think that in a 26-man squad the answer is probably ‘Yes, don’t be silly, we do still need another proper striker’.",
      "Tuchel sees it similarly, having said he will likely pick another ‘classic number nine’. That keeps Watkins above the 26-man cutline for now, but even the fact Tuchel is talking about the possibility of not having one, and pointedly refusing to dismiss the idea altogether (“I cannot rule out that we go with one striker, but it’s more likely we have more than one classic number nine”) while also not specifically mentioning Watkins by name mean it’s looking dicier than it probably should for someone with literally no meaningful competition at this time.",
      "",
      "Back in the fold and given a couple of different roles in the Serbia and Albania games as Tuchel tries to succeed where others have failed and unlock Foden’s obvious talents in an England setting.",
      "We do like the false nine option deployed against Serbia; anything that reduces the need for unnecessary spare Kane back-ups in the squad in favour of more versatile players is to be encouraged.",
      "The collective will for Foden to show what he can do for England perhaps led to be a bit of an over-reaction to his assist for Eberechi Eze’s goal – described in at least one place as ‘putting it on a plate’ for the Arsenal playmaker. But we’re not having it as the easy-peasy straightforward pass some naysayers have insisted it was on the other side of the debate.",
      "One of the advantages of having skilled finishers in creative positions is they know exactly what pass they would want to receive if roles were reversed, and Foden’s pass to Eze was exactly that. Perfect weight, perfect line, so that Eze didn’t have to break stride and a difficult finish was made as easy as it could be.",
      "Against Albania, we even got a brief glimpse of the Foden-Bellingham-Kane triangle Tuchel had previously dismissed as impossible. So there’s definitely hope.",
      "It still feels like at least one ludicrously talented attacking player is going to miss out when Tuchel’s final 26 is named, but it’s less likely now than it was a fortnight ago for Foden’s to be that name.",
      "",
      "Appears to be fourth-choice centre-back. As sanguine as we are about the first three centre-backs, this fills us with some kind of dread.",
      "We would really very much like something more compelling and bit less cumbersome to make itself known by March, please and thank you.",
      "He’s a good lad is Burn, and it’s been a great story. But we really don’t think he’s good enough, and he’s now the one player we’ve got inside the 26-man cutline about whom we have those kind of deep-lying fears.",
      "",
      "Time is running out and others are making strong claims for all sorts of roles within England’s attack. As we’ve said time and again elsewhere, there are simply more excellent attacking players available to Tuchel than squad positions for them all and someone deserving of a place – probably multiple someones – is going to miss out.",
      "And there is a real risk that Palmer, who has played only 64 minutes for England under Tuchel in their least convincing performance (the 1-0 win over Andorra), is such a someone.",
      "Probably not. Still probably not. On balance, his ability and versatility still probably tip the scales far enough his way. Especially if he can recover sufficient goalscoring touch to convince Tuchel he can offer a meaningful option as the focus of England’s attack rather as well as one of its support riders.",
      "Does feel quite mad to be talking about someone we tried and failed to squeeze into the F365 England starting XI perhaps missing out on the squad altogether, but that’s the level of competition.",
      "There will, inevitably, be stuff in here that looks absolutely mental come March. Because that’s four months away, and there’s stuff that looks mental from one Ladder to the next when there’s only one month between them.",
      "But we really hope ‘Palmer might not even make the squad’ is one of the things that looks really crazy by March.",
      "",
      "A touch overpromoted in October on the back of our desire for neatness and trying to make the first 11 names on the ladder represent an actual starting XI, but despite being a non-playing member of the squad in this break he doesn’t fall too far.",
      "Tuchel’s obvious dislike of Spence’s infamous Thomas Frank snub after the Chelsea game felt a bit OTT and quite schoolmasterly to us – and also quite funny given Tuchel’s own history with handshakes at the end of games between Chelsea and Tottenham – but can’t be ignored either given the Ladder’s remit.",
      "But we still think Tuchel values Spence’s pure defensive ability as a full-back with tough major tournament tests in mind. He might not be first choice or even necessarily first reserve on either flank, but we’d still be surprised to see him left out altogether because he does offer that one-on-one ability to nullify the best, and that’s a powerful weapon to have in the arsenal for a player who is also perfectly capable of starting any game at full-back on either flank.",
      "",
      "Could return to Newcastle this weekend after missing their last nine games through injury, and no specialist has staked much of a claim to be the second right-back in the squad.",
      "Djed Spence, Ezri Konsa and Jarell Quansah have all been used there in addition to obvious first choice Reece James, and that can’t do Livramento any harm.",
      "And while Spence in particular offers a solid defensive option on that right-hand side, we’re still not sure you’d really want to be picking a 26-man squad in which Reece ‘Darren Anderton’ James is your only specialist right-back.",
      "Livramento, despite his own recent injury struggles, hasn’t really been usurped at all in the fight to be that second specialist right-back.",
      "",
      "We’ve desperately wanted to put him higher and higher in the Ladder but couldn’t because it’s the England manager’s Ladder, not ours. And for some inexplicable reason, we are not the England manager.",
      "We really do think Wharton, with his vision and line-breaking passing ability is the kind of high-risk, high-reward player you want in a tournament squad. There’s a make-something-happen quality to him that doesn’t really show itself in stats or data. He’s an old-school player who absolutely has to be watched to be appreciated.",
      "A bit unfortunate to get his chance in an experimental formation, one that confused more experienced international minds than his, but still did well even when often finding himself as a pretty isolated single-pivot in England’s midfield.",
      "Tuchel acknowledged as much after the Albania game, while also stressing that isolation was not Wharton’s fault. We’ve heard enough: Tuchel likes him, up the list he goes to join Rice, Anderson and Henderson among Tuchel’s World Cup midfield options.",
      "",
      "Lucky to get a reprieve and find himself in this squad with Nick Pope suffering cruel injury timing, and for now that means, with the clock ticking and only one more England camp before final squad choices are made, we’re leaning towards Tuchel sticking with what he knows for such a low-key position as third-choice keeper.",
      "But if by March Pope is playing well for Newcastle and Trafford is still riding the bench at Man City, he can have few complaints if he loses even that bench-warming position for his country.",
      "",
      "Was England’s best and most consistent attacking threat in that disjointed first half against Albania and we do really like the energy that Bowen brings to the table. Does feel like he offers a tangible point of difference as a right-wing option in comparison to Saka and Madueke.",
      "But Bowen surely sits behind that pair in Tuchel’s thinking when everyone’s fit, and that leaves the West Ham man in some significant danger of finding himself without a seat when the music stops next year. He’d be desperately unfortunate to miss out on the squad, but we’re finding it increasingly hard to work out how Tuchel can possibly pick a coherent, balanced squad without some enormously talented attacking players being desperately unfortunate.",
      "Unless there’s a wild injury crisis, and we really don’t want to wish that into existence no matter how much easier it would make this – ultimately trivial – Ladder to compile.",
      "",
      "Got a long-awaited and deserved debut, but got it at right-back. Or kind of right-centre-back in sort of a three-man defence but not really. In the hardest game of an admittedly easy group.",
      "It was not fertile ground for making a great impression, but Tuchel certainly seemed to like what he saw. Personally, we thought the ‘like he had 50 caps already’ quote was a bit odd and that Quansah had done, at best, a serviceable job in an unusual position that wouldn’t really be anyone’s speciality and certainly not his.",
      "What that ringing endorsement must do, though, is shove him up this Ladder a fair few places. That fourth centre-back spot is still there to be claimed, and incumbent Dan Burn is far from secure.",
      "",
      "Deserved his recall and was desperately unlucky to miss out on it through concussion. Still has every chance of unseating Manchester City bench-warmer James Trafford as the third-choice keeper, but time is now tight.",
      "",
      "Not as good as Jude Bellingham, and more importantly not as good for England as Morgan Rogers. And Thomas Tuchel seems wildly unlikely to find room in his squad for a third No. 10 when he has so many other elite and versatile attacking choices.",
      "",

      "Premier League • England",
      "Fabrizio Romano has named Manchester United’s ‘dream’ midfield signing and both he and sources at TEAMtalk have confirmed the player wants to join the Red Devils.",
      "It’s no secret Man Utd are on the hunt for impactful additions in central midfield next year. However, what’s less clear is which of the countless players they’re linked with they actually want to sign, and of those, who is number one on the shortlist.",
      "From just the Premier League, Adam Wharton, Carlos Baleba and Elliot Anderson are understood to be in Man Utd’s crosshairs. From further afield, the likes of Conor Gallagher and Angelo Stiller have been mentioned.",
      "United may yet make multiple additions in midfield, but obviously will not sign five new players in the same position. And per the latest from transfer guru, Fabrizio Romano, we now know who United will give priority to signing before all others.",
      "“There is a lot of confusion in the media [about] who is the dream target for Manchester United in midfield,” began Romano when speaking on his YouTube channel.",
      "“My information remains that there are several names, but I keep telling you since August, don’t forget Man Utd want Carlos Baleba.",
      "“Baleba wants to go to Man Utd. Man Utd want Baleba. The conversations with the player and his agents were very good but at that time in August, Brighton didn’t want to sell the player.”",
      "United made an official approach to Brighton for Baleba in the summer window, but were informed a deal could not be made at that time, irrespective of how much United bid.",
      "The Red Devils’ interest in the 21-year-old has maintained and Romano then stressed a winter window move will be “difficult,” with a summer swoop in 2026 the likelier scenario.",
      "“In January it’s likely to be a difficult deal,” the reporter continued. “Brighton insist on not selling the player [in January].",
      "“But for the summer, unless the stance changes in January, let’s see what happens… but the summer of 2026, for sure, Man Utd see Baleba as a priority target.”",
      "Romano concluded by stating Man Utd will “insist” on signing Baleba next year and and the player is “very keen” on making the move.",
      "At the time of United’s approach for Baleba in August, it was widely reported the Cameroon international was receptive to the interest but was not actively seeking to leave Brighton.",
      "However, Romano categorically stated Baleba now “wants to go to Man Utd” and that echoes what our own insider, Dean Jones, reported on Sunday.",
      "Jones revealed Baleba “clearly wants the move” and United’s summer approach – which may have been launched with one eye on turning the player’s head ahead of a move in 2026 – appears to have succeeded.",
      "The player is now unsettled on the south coast and would jump at the chance to move to Old Trafford. However, Brighton – who previously valued Baleba in excess of £100m – won’t go down quietly.",
      "Baleba is contracted to the Seagulls until 2028 and there’s an option for an extra season. As such, Man Utd’s biggest issue now is negotiating a more palatable fee with Brighton, but one that is still convincing enough to get their green light.",
      "Jones exclusively told TEAMtalk on Sunday: “It is being talked about again that Baleba is a priority target, but it has to be stressed that they [United] are not paying £100million for him any time soon.",
      "“The player clearly wants the move, and their attempt to turn his head in the summer has worked, but his form has actually been worse since then, and so I do not see United going close to the level Brighton value him at.",
      "“The message remains clear that United want a midfielder in January and also a midfielder in summer.",
      "“So they are working on targets that are attainable in each of those, and the ones from the Premier League seem unattainable in January. That’s how the picture is for now.",
      "“Obviously, these things can change, but Baleba is going to have to be very patient here because a lot is going on.",
      "“United do still like him; they do still think he would suit the role, but his form and valuation do not match up at the moment. And on top of that, Brighton don’t want to sell him in January.”",
      "In other news, insider Ben Jacobs has revealed it’s “absolutely true” that Manchester United want to sign a Newcastle star who director of football Jason Wilcox knows “incredibly well.”",
      "Elsewhere, Eric Cantona has told Sir Jim Ratcliffe he has “destroyed” the style of football created by Sir Alex Ferguson at Manchester United, and the legend has revealed his offer to help the club was rebuffed.",
      "Finally, Manchester United scouts will be patting themselves on their backs for identifying a young midfield gem who has won a major award, but the Red Devils will not find it easy to negotiate a deal with Nottingham Forest owner Evangelos Marinakis."

His current contract expires in 2027, he earns £350,000 a week, and the Old Trafford club wants him to stay but on a much lower salary: £130,000 a week . This figure is ridiculous, and Casemiro will likely reject it. If that happens, [Aurelien] Tchouameni is the Red Devils’ first choice.’",

Hours later he entered the plush luxury of the Mayfair Hotel near Hyde Park, where Chelsea wanted to hear for the second time how the Dane viewed the game, people and leadership.’",
      "‘Two meetings. Two of the world’s biggest clubs. On one and the same day. No contract was signed. United went with Rúben Amorim. Chelsea with Enzo Maresca. But for Thomas Frank, the day was proof that his name had now become one that was talked about in the finest circles.’",

      "Munoz told a press conference: “Everything I hear out there, all the talk about one club or another, if you ask me, for me it would be a dream to play for one of these clubs.",
      "READ: Chelsea beat Liverpool to ‘best player of his age in South America’ with five deals worth more than £56m confirmed",
      "“Whether it’s Barcelona, ​​PSG, Real Madrid, or Manchester United, I work towards that, I strive every day, so that maybe one day I can catch the attention of one of these clubs because it’s a dream for me.",
      "“But the truth is that I’m focused on my club, on doing things well at Crystal Palace, and I’m not really aware of what’s being said on social media.",
      "“I don’t have any information that any of these clubs want me or are interested in me. These days my focus is on Crystal Palace and, obviously, here with the national team.”",

      "“Our head scout, Dirk Schoofs, would always ask me to take a look at this guy or that guy.",
      "“We had been following Daniel for quite some time. After the first game of his that I watched, my recommendation immediately was to take him. Why? Because they were winning 3-0 in the 92nd minute and he was still going forward like an animal.",
      "“He can always sniff the right moment to attack the back post or be on the backs of the central defenders of the opponent, ready to pick up tap-ins or second balls. He has a feel for that and he also had the hunger and desire to score.”",
      "Ribeiro added: “I was surprised bigger clubs didn’t come in for him at Genk. Even now I’m surprised, with all the respect to Crystal Palace, that one of the top clubs in England hasn’t picked him up because he has a fantastic work ethic and attitude and he could help anywhere, at any club in the country.”"

      "They will have to wait a little while for Melia, whose move as the League of Ireland’s record sale cannot be officially ratified until he turns 18 because Brexit. That’s so long, in fact, that said Irish transfer record has already been broken again.",
      "The forward had a trial with Manchester City and counted Arsenal among his numerous suitors, having made his debut – and scored – at just 15. Frankfurt actually tried to bring him in as Omar Marmoush’s replacement in January.",

      "But Chelsea stole in to sort a deal out to bestow upon whoever they appoint as manager in summer 2026 a shiny new signing.",
      "Their willingness to let Quenda stay in Portugal for another season helped Chelsea beat a number of clubs and also negotiate a lower fee, which will still make him a mightily expensive teenager by the time he eventually joins. But not the most expensive in Premier League or even Chelsea history.",
      "",
      "The cousin of Arsenal centre-half Gabriel, attacking left-back Denner will join him in London some time after his 18th birthday next February.",

      "The centre-half will have to wait until the first transfer window after he turns 18 to make his move to the Premier League.",
      "Liverpool were said to be interested and the Daily Mail even referenced youth scouts calling Ordonez ‘the best player of his age-group in the whole of South America’.",

      "Wednesday 12 November 2025 13:02, UK",
      "It has been a breakthrough season for Radek Vitek.",
      "The Manchester United goalkeeper has enjoyed a hugely beneficial loan spell so far at Bristol City - a move that came around because City's previous No 1 Max O'Leary suffered an ankle injury at the end of last season which forced the club to move for a short-term replacement.",
      "Vitek was brought in on a season-long loan but has surpassed any expectations from when he first arrived at the club and is now keeping O'Leary out of the team having recovered from his injury, due to a run of dominant performances by the young Czech keeper.",
      "\"It's true it came a little bit out of nowhere,\" Vitek said. \"I knew I was going to go on loan this season because I had an agreement with the coach it was the best thing to do and get more experience at a higher level than last year.",
      "\"It was a no-brainer because to play in the Championship for a club such as Bristol City for me was really attractive.",
      "\"I said yes straight away after I spoke with Gerhard Struber.\"",
      "Vitek had previously been on loan at Accrington Stanley in League Two before spending a season in Austria but Vitek's impressive form for City has helped lead them to eighth in the table.",
      "\"I'm still quite young but I would describe myself as a goalkeeper who likes to be both dominant and also confident for the team in front of me so they can rely on me,\" Vitek explained.",
      "\"Everything since day one has come together. The people around the club, the city… everyone has been really nice to me since day one and the fans have been amazing.",
      "\"First game away from home, Sheffield Wednesday... to celebrate the win like that was an amazing memory. I don't think I'll ever forget this one.\"",
      "Having grown up in Czechia, Vitek admitted he was a shy kid growing up - perhaps more introverted than you would expect from a now 6ft 6in goalkeeper.",
      "Vitek admitted he did not start out his footballing journey in goal and he used to play every position when he was younger, but as with other kids who hit a growth spurt earlier than others, he was thrown into goal because he was always the tallest in his age group.",
      "Having joined Czech side SK Sigma Olomouc's academy, Vitek was soon invited to trial for different clubs in England after catching the eye in his home country.",
      "But for Vitek, at just 16-years-old there was only one club he was interested in signing for.",
      "\"I knew straight away that Manchester United wanted me,\" Vitek said. \"They told me straight after seven weeks' trial, they told me they want me to sign.",
      "\"It was the time when Covid hit though - I spent six months at home but I didn't have any doubts because I felt really confident with the conversations I had with the coaches in Manchester.",
      "\"Obviously my club knew as well about the interest and they already spoke with Manchester United about the contracts and everything like that so it was basically done - some of my team-mates couldn't believe it because it's not an everyday thing someone goes from a Czech academy to a club like Manchester United.\"",
      "Almost six years on from signing for the club, this feels like a huge milestone in Vitek's footballing journey and development.",
      "Playing regularly, showing what he can do at the size of a club like Bristol City is clearly doing him wonders.",
      "It was undoubtedly pleasing for those at Manchester United as well, as he is highly-rated at Carrington. Despite Senne Lammens impressing at United since his summer arrival, the No 1 shirt still feels there to be fought for at this moment in time.",
      "So could we see Radek Vitek in that shirt one day?",
      "\"I'm taking it step-by-step, we'll see next summer what's best for me,\" Vitek said. \"I speak on a regular basis with my goalkeeper coach from Manchester United who has come here to watch my games and I have a good connection with them.",
      "\"I know they're watching me and I really appreciate that I'm not just the guy who is being forgotten or anything.",
      "\"Obviously long term, I would love to play for Manchester United one day but also I'm realistic and I know that my pathway can lead somewhere different as well.\"",

      "By Rob Harris, Sky News",
      "Wednesday 12 November 2025 10:44, UK",
      "Manchester United have been accused of harming the career of a former player by failing to treat an injury \"promptly\" and \"appropriately\", leaving him with more serious long-term problems, according to a £1m lawsuit obtained by Sky News.",
      "While defender Axel Tuanzebe is still in the Premier League at Burnley, he blames United for no longer being able to play \"without restriction or impediment\", impacting his career and earnings.",
      "The landmark case has been brought by the footballer claiming clinical negligence - shining an unprecedented spotlight on the inner workings of a leading club's medical care and alleged handling of an injury.",
      "The lawsuit lodged at the High Court in London shows the 27-year-old Congolese player \"expects to recover damages in excess of £1,000,000\".",
      "An academy graduate at United, he left the club in 2023 after 17 years before going on to join Ipswich Town for two seasons and then signing for Burnley in June. United declined to comment.",
      "The case centres on stress fractures at the back of the spine, which the British Association of Spine Surgeons says footballers are vulnerable to.",
      "It's alleged Tuanzebe sustained a left-sided pars fracture in January 2020, which became chronic by July 2022 when he also developed a right-sided pars fracture.",
      "The lawsuit says: \"Appropriate treatment plans would, on the balance of probabilities, have resulted in the claimant avoiding the pain and discomfort set out below and would have resulted in him being able to play professional football at elite level without restriction or impediment.",
      "\"As it is, although he continues to play at an elite level, this has impacted his career and earnings.\"",
      "The details of the injury have never previously been reported.",
      "The case centres on how MRI scans in early 2020 were interpreted following a hamstring injury suffered in a League Cup match in December 2019 against Colchester.",
      "A suspected pars fracture was detected - referencing spinal stress fractures in the lower back, which athletes can suffer from repeated movements.",
      "The lawsuit says: \"It is the claimant's case that the defendant [United] negligently failed to properly investigate the claimant's pars fractures, failed to rest the claimant and failed to refer him to a specialist sports spinal surgeon.",
      "\"As a result, the claimant's symptoms significantly progressed to bilateral grade 4 fractures, and he developed a left-sided chronic spinal fracture.",
      "\"Had the claimant been appropriately rested, his left-sided pars fracture would not have developed into a chronic condition and the right-sided fracture would have been avoided altogether.\"",
      "The fractures, which developed by July 2022, caused Tuanzebe \"significant pain and discomfort since their development and deterioration.\"",
      "The lawsuit claims that in January 2020, United \"failed to refer him to a specialist sports spinal surgeon\" who would have apparently advised at least 12 weeks of rest to allow the fracture to heal.",
      "But Tuanzebe was back playing by March 2020 for United in the Premier League 2 development competition and returned to first-team action in October in the Champions League against French side Paris Saint-Germain.",
      "Then United manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer hailed \"a tremendous defender, a great leader\", adding: \"He's going to be a top player for us and he's got the character and the attitude that a Man Utd player should have.\"",
      "In December 2020, Tuanzebe told United he was suffering hamstring pain after sprinting. Despite concerns at the start of the year, the lower spine \"was not imaged on this occasion\", the lawsuit says.",
      "The lawsuit says: \"By allowing the claimant to train and play as normal from February to March 2020 and thereafter, he suffered more serious symptoms than he would have if he had been diagnosed promptly and treated appropriately with rest.\"",
      "It claims an \"appropriate treatment plan\" was only put in place three years later - in April 2023.",
      "The lawsuit says: \"Appropriate treatment plans would, on the balance of probabilities, have resulted in the claimant avoiding the pain and discomfort set out below and would have resulted in him being able to play professional football at elite level without restriction or impediment.",
      "\"As it is, although he continues to play at an elite level, this has impacted his career and earnings.\"",
      "It was while on loan at Napoli in January 2022 that left-sided lower back pain led to the Italian club sending Tuanzebe for scans.",
      "United were informed by Tuanzebe of difficulties getting out of bed and into his car.",
      "But Dr Steve McNally, United senior club doctor and head of sports medicine and science, who left the club after 16 years in December 2022 to take a role with the PGMOL, is alleged to have \"indicated no urgency\" for him to return home for an examination.",
      "Dr McNally is alleged to have told Tuanzebe it was \"most likely\" he had \"disc irritation or change in posture mechanics rather than a stress problem\" and that it \"usually resolves with physio\" rather than being serious.",
      "The lawsuit highlights the period from January 2020 to January 2022, claiming United \"failed to properly assess, record or attempt to treat the claimant's fracture in the acute phase\" when further regular medical examinations were required and appropriate rest from training and playing was needed.",
      "Examinations continued into the following month, February 2022.",
      "The lawsuit says while a stress fracture was excluded by Dr McNally following a CT scan, there could be an \"inflamed facet joint between the vertebrae\".",
      "But Napoli's club doctor said an analysis of a CT scan showed a potential stress fracture, described as \"chronic incomplete lysis of the isthmus of L5 with intact superior cortical profile\".",
      "Dr McNally is alleged to have responded by saying that it was already visible on a CT scan from 2017, so \"don't think that would cause your current pain\".",
      "Based on a referral by United, Tuanzebe was recommended pain relief injections in March 2022.",
      "Despite reporting pain in June 2022, Tuanzebe went on United's pre-season tour to Thailand the following month, but then asked to return to England for treatment.",
      "After further MRI and CT scans, a stress fracture of the spine was reported in medical reports in August 2022.",
      "He was able to return to full training by January 2023 and joined Stoke on loan until the end of the season, but ongoing discomfort limited him to five appearances.",
      "United then released Tuanzebe rather than triggering a one-year contract extension.",
      "The lawsuit says: \"By allowing the claimant to return to training and playing, including an intense strength and conditioning and running programme following August 17 2022, this has caused him to suffer more serious symptoms than he would have if he had been diagnosed promptly and treated appropriately with rest.\"",
      "The \"particulars of claim\", which sets out the basis for the case, was filed after being signed by Tuanzebe on October 27."

      "Thursday 6 November 2025 14:47, UK",
      "Manchester United boss Ruben Amorim has urged people to \"forget\" the past after Cristiano Ronaldo's scathing criticism of the club.",
      "Ronaldo delivered a damning verdict of United's current squad and suggested Amorim cannot perform \"miracles\" at Old Trafford.",
      "In another interview on Piers Morgan Uncensored, after his 2022 sitdown led to the premature end of his second spell at United, Ronaldo said: \"He's [Amorim] doing his best. What are you gonna do? Miracles? Miracles are impossible. We say in Portugal, miracles are only in Fatima.",
      "\"You're not gonna do miracles. Even the players. Manchester United have good players, but then some of them don't have the mind what is Manchester United?\"",
      "Asked about Ronaldo's comments, Amorim suggested that, despite Ronaldo knowing full well the impact that his words can have and mistakes in the past, improvements are being made at Old Trafford.",
      "\"He knows he has a huge impact in everything he says,\" Amorim said at his press conference.",
      "\"What we need to do is focus on the future. We know that we, as a club, made a lot of mistakes in the past, but we are trying to change that. So let's not focus on what happened.",

      "\"So let's focus on the way we are doing things; we are improving. Let's continue and forget a little bit [about] the past.\"",
      "Amorim was facing the media ahead of United's trip to Tottenham on Saturday lunchtime. It's the first time United will have met Spurs since a sobering 1-0 Europa League final defeat in May.",
      "A win for Amorim's side, who have shown an upturn in form on a current run of four without defeat, will see them move into second place in the Premier League. Amorim believes he will take a better United team to Tottenham than the one that lost to Spurs in Bilbao. Asked about the differences in his current side, Amorim said:",
      "\"First of all, the characteristics of the players. We have different characteristics in our team. We also have a lot of players who played last year, so we are a better team. We play better. We understand the game better.",
      "\"I think we are more confident. We reached that final confident that we could win because we were doing well in Europe. But in this moment, we play with a different confidence.",
      "\"We manage the moments of the game better. But if you remember that game, they have that shot on the goal; they won the game. So I expect a different game, that we can play better, but also to have a little bit of luck to help us to win the game.",
      "\"We believe more that we can win any game, and we already proved that we can win any game. The last game [at Nottingham Forest] was tough on us, because in some moments, we were not the team that we were supposed to be in every minute.",
      "\"And compare that to Brighton, and we suffer two goals against Brighton, but was a different thing. So we know that we cannot forget that we have a lot to improve.",
      "\"We are more prepared for anything that happens in the game, so that is also a good thing. So we are in a better moment, but we also know that we have a lot to do, a lot to improve, to be able to win more of this kind of game, and consistently win games in a row.",
      "\"So we know that we are capable, we are confident, but we also know that we struggle sometimes in games that we need to do better.\"",
      "Defeat in May and a 15th-place finish meant that United missed out on a place in this season's Champions League, while Spurs, who finished 17th, qualified for the competition.",
      "Despite a lack of European football for just the second time in Premier League history, Amorim maintains he sees the positives of the loss in the final.",
      "\"It's not the fact of seeing the positive is using the positives. So any situation that you have in your life, you can look in a positive way or in a bad way. If you ask me, you prefer to be here with a cup in the Champions League.",
      "\"Champions League, more money, more players? Maybe, of course, I will say yes, but you have the other side. You have more time to train, to know your players, to arrange everything, the connection between staff and to prepare the future.",
      "\"In the future will be with European competition. So we just tried to use the positive thing of not playing all the games during the week. So yes, I can see the positives.\"",

United have made signing a new midfielder a priority in the summer, but they might need to accelerate those plans.William Bitibiri",
      "For a team with ambitions of qualifying for next season's Champions League, Tottenham's home form is simply not good enough. No ever-present side has fewer home points in the Premier League in 2025.",
      "That run has continued under Thomas Frank, whose sole league victory this season at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium came on the opening weekend against promoted-side Burnley.",
      "When Richarlison glanced in Wilson Odobert's cross in the first minute of stoppage-time to make it 2-1 against Man Utd, it seemed certain that fact would change.",

      "That does not mean that Mikel Arteta's side are now going to be conceding goals left, right and centre, but it does mean that at the other end they will need to be more clinical.",
      "Arteta will point to the fact that he was without several attacking options. Viktor Gyokeres joined the likes of Kai Havertz, Gabriel Martinelli, Gabriel Jesus and Noni Madueke on the sidelines, but the Gunners still created 17 chances.",
      "Bukayo Saka and Leandro Trossard may have scored, but they also wasted good chances. William Saliba may not be the one you would point at to find the net, but he too will look back on today's game thinking they could have got his name on the scoresheet.",

Silly free-kicks, rushed decisions in the final third. Yes, they composed themselves after the break, but Sunderland left them rattled.",

      "That could be the day Chelsea establish serious momentum. Or the day their shortcomings are underlined.",

      "Watching him at West Ham always reminds me on the classic Whac-A-Mole game from the 1990s. Just when you think he has disappeared, out of sight from the first team and with too many whacks on the head to rise again, up he pops to make big contributions for the club.",
      "His role playing as the emergency striker in the final 15 minutes of this crucial clash with Burnley provided the spark that the Hammers were lacking as the game wore on. His legs may not move as quick as they once did but his game intelligence and the nuisance factor he brings certainly remains.",
      "\"Every time Soucek played against me, he was a nightmare,\" said his manager Nuno Espirito Santo, who has to take big credit for utlising Soucek in this role.

      "Fulham, though, will be left frustrated. They improved after the break, with Josh King and Rodrigo Muniz both forcing saves from Jordan Pickford, but their lack of quality in the final third once again proved their downfall as the pressure grows near the bottom.Sam Cohen",

      "\"When I think about the sporting department, we are making progress in every single area.\"",
      "In an interview aired on Tuesday, Cristiano Ronaldo gave a scathing review of United's current identity and lack of structure. Amorim, too, has received a fair share of scrutiny for his perceived rigid 3-4-3 system. However, Wilcox disagrees and believes the current work being done is helping to establish United's identity and game model.",
      "\"We've just got to continue to build the spirit,\" Wilcox said.",
      "\"Continue to build on Ruben's idea. He's got a very clear idea. It's a lot more flexible than people give him credit for.",
      "\"We've got to start with the end in mind and understand the game model, how Manchester United are, is really important.",
      "\"And we have to pull the jigsaw together. We would love to have all the pieces in place where we can see a very clear picture.",
      "\"But while we're building the picture, it's really important. It's even more difficult when you lose some football matches, because people start questioning things. But we're really clear, myself, Ruben, Omar [Berrada] and the ownership. We're really clear on the direction of travel. And this is really important.\"",
      "Transfers have been a mystery at Old Trafford for many years. While United have always been active in windows, the opaque nature of United's transfer strategy has opened the door for criticism for supposed slow dealings and reported missed targets.",
      "However, Wilcox lifted the lid on how United's hierarchy work with head coach Amorim to navigate transfers.",
      "\"The brief will come from me and Ruben,\" Wilcox said.",
      "\"It goes into Chris [Vivell], a lot of debate and discussion around the profiles of what we need, and then the scouts will go into the market.",
      "\"We'll combine that with the data team, and they'll just be in a constant dialogue. Right now, I'm having weekly meetings with the recruitment team on the different profiles.",
      "\"The different age brackets, the costs, are they attainable with Ruben as well. So it's a real joined-up approach.",
      "\"When we sign a player, there are so many people that are involved in the process, the data team are involved in the process.",
      "\"We will then focus all our attention on certain players. And it's really important then that we do the background checks around.",
      "\"Are they clean-living professionals? This is really important. This year we looked at Premier League-ready players.",
      "\"Certainly with Bryan [Mbeumo] and Matheus [Cunha], we couldn't take too much risk in this area.",
      "\"We needed players that we could plug in and play with little transition time. Senne [Lammens], we were always looking at goalkeepers who have got huge potential, and Senne was available. We decided to move but it wasn't a knee-jerk reaction.",
      "\"Tony Cotton [Man Utd goalkeeper scout] was putting Senne on my radar 12 months ago and he was relentless with it.",
      "\"'This guy is going to be a top signing for us. And he's started well, but he's got to keep it going. He's very reflective and he's very professional in his approach.\"",
      "Summer signings Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Senne Lammens have played their role in United's upturn in form, with fans impressed with not only their performances but their attitude.",
      "United's recent transfer success is a trend that Wilcox suggests will continue at Old Trafford as the club aim to re-establish themselves at the top of the Premier League, as well as being capable of competing in Europe.",
      "\"We have got a clear plan,\" Wilcox told the United website.",
      "\"We know what we have got to do, we know the areas of the team that we have got to improve.",
      "\"For us to get in the top four and consistently challenge for Champions League places, win Champions League, win Premier League, we have got to invest in the squad.",
      "\"We have got to buy the right players. The right players who are talented but also who can deal with the pressure, who can take the squad forward. It is not always about just signing elite talent; they have got to have the right character and be somebody who can bring something different to the team.\"",
