      "Bruno Fernandes' impact was on display for Manchester United against Manchester City(Image: AFP or licensors)",
      "Manchester United are keen to enter contract discussions with Bruno Fernandes ahead of the World Cup. Earlier this season, the Red Devils captain revealed he was on the brink of a move to Saudi Arabian team Al-Hilal last summer.",
      "Although the transfer didn't materialise, United will be preparing for further interest in the former Sporting Lisbon star. Fernandes, 31, has expressed his desire to make decisions about his future once the World Cup in the USA, Canada and Mexico concludes.",
      "However, it seems United are eager to understand his intentions before the tournament kicks off in the summer, despite his previous comments. ESPN reports club officials are planning a pre-World Cup meeting with Fernandes to clarify his decision.",
      "His current contract with the club runs until the summer of 2027 and United have the option to extend his contract for an additional year, keeping him at Old Trafford until 2028. However, it's suggested they are content to let him decide his next steps.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UTD FB PAGE! Latest United news and more on our dedicated Facebook page",
      "Nevertheless, it's believed United would prefer him to stay at the club for at least another season. Against Manchester City, he demonstrated exactly why United do not want to let go of him.",
      "Michael Carrick's second stint as interim manager got off to a flying start with a resounding 2-0 victory over City in the Manchester Derby. Fernandes played a pivotal role in the win over Pep Guardiola's side, setting up Bryan Mbeumo's goal.",
      "Bruno Fernandes was pivotal against Manchester City(Image: 2026 Getty Images)",
      "The board are keen for Fernandes to stay at Old Trafford to aid the transition to a new manager. Carrick has made a promising start, but it's unlikely he'll be given the role permanently.",
      "In December, Fernandes surprised club officials by telling journalists he believed United were ready to cash in on him. The midfielder suggested the club wanted to sell him, but didn't because then-manager Ruben Amorim wanted to keep him.",
      "Speaking to Portuguese TV station Canal 11, Fernandes said: \"The club wanted me to go [away]. I told the directors that, I don't think they had the courage to make that decision because the coach wanted me. But if I said I wanted to leave, even though the coach wanted me to stay, the club would let me.\"",
      "Fernandes provided the perfect pass for Mbeumo to score the opening goal against City(Image: DARREN STAPLES, AFP via Getty Images)",
      "He added: \"I was valued, what values me most has to be my club, although I feel, lately, that I'm a little on the tightrope. In England a player reaches 30 and they think he has to remodel.",
      "\"The issue of loyalty is not as well-regarded as it used to be. I could have left in this market, I was going to earn a lot more money, a season ago I was going to leave, I was going to win many trophies this season.\"",
      "Fernandes has scored nine goals and provided five assists in 19 Premier League matches this season, and also set up a goal in United's 2-1 FA Cup defeat to Brighton and Hove Albion.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Marcus Rashford is not guaranteed a permanent move to Barcelona(Image: Jose Breton/Pics Action/NurPhoto via Getty Images)",
      "Marcus Rashford's future seems to be heading in one direction, even following Ruben Amorim's exit from Manchester United. The striker appears set to prolong his stint in Barcelona after his loan period this season, though a transfer could still encounter some obstacles.",
      "Rashford moved to the Catalan side in the summer and has since notched eight goals and 11 assists across 29 outings. The 28-year-old has shone at Barca despite a wealth of attacking options, including Lamine Yamal and Raphinha, with the club eager to retain his services.",
      "The La Liga leaders possess a £26.1million option they can trigger to secure the player's permanent signature at the season's end. Rashford, who found the net from the substitutes' bench at the weekend, is also reportedly enthusiastic about remaining at Camp Nou.",
      "Barca continue to be pleased with Rashford's impact this campaign but are understood to harbour some reservations regarding his defensive work. The England star is not considered as effective at pressing as Raphinha, though his commitment and attitude are valued, according to The Athletic.",
      "This could still prove a consideration that gives Barcelona cause for reflection. The Spanish table-toppers have not been financially comfortable in recent campaigns, which might yet create hesitation come summer.",
      "Barca may explore alternative arrangements beyond activating the clause to strike a deal with United. The combination of the transfer fee and Rashford's wages could prove challenging for the club to accommodate.",
      "The report suggests that Barcelona could even U-turn on their plan to activate their purchase clause for Rashford - and consider signing him on loan for a second season instead. Rashford's contract with United runs until 2028.",
      "Barcelona manager Hansi Flick has certainly seemed delighted to have Rashford available. The German boss highlighted the loanee as a prime example of commitment to the club, despite an uncertain future.",

      "\"If you want to play with Barca, then it has to be 100 per cent with your whole heart. This is what I want to say to everyone: 100 per cent. These colours, you have to live for them. All the others, I don't want.\"",

Both of them should have been offloaded a long time ago, but they are still here collecting their paychecks.",

It is definitely a possibility that they just like being part of Manchester United and earning a lot of money, but that tells me a lot about their ambitions.

      "Rooney’s United were established winners, Arsenal have won one FA Cup in the past eight full seasons. United’s points per game ratio in 2006/07 and 2007/08 is better than Arsenal’s current 2.27 per game.",
      "In the 2007/08 Premier League season, United averaged 2.18 goals per game, Arsenal are currently scoring at a rate of 1.82 per game.",
      "Arsenal’s defensive excellence has been key to their superiority this season but, in the Premier League, they are still conceding at a higher rate to what United conceded at in 2007/08.",
      "Arsenal are letting in an average of 0.64 goals per match, the Premier League champions of 2007/08 let in an average of 0.58 goals per match.",
      "The current goal difference graph has Arsenal finishing with a figure of 45, United of 2007/08 finished with a goal difference of 58.",
      "United’s back line - based on the partnership of Rio Ferdinand and Nemanja Vidic - would have coped well with what Arsenal have to offer going forward while Rooney, Carlos Tevez and Cristiano Ronaldo would have given the much-vaunted Gunners defence a lot more trouble than what presents itself week in, week out in this largely underwhelming 2025/26 season.",
      "It would be a decent battle in midfield but, in the end, United would come out on top. Batter? Maybe not. Beat? Certainly.",
      "United were able to trot out a decent front three(Image: DAILY RECORD)",
      "These debates are always extremely hard to get right. In the 18 years since United won their third Champions League, football has changed dramatically. It could be argued that the current Arsenal team would be significantly fitter and also have the ability to use possession in a way which English teams struggle to do at that point.",
      "I would have no arguments if people either sit either side of the fence in the Rio Ferdinand and Nemanja Vidic or Gabriel Magalhaes and William Saliba debate. They are both truly elite. Declan Rice, Martin Zubimendi and Mikel Merino aren't a bad midfield three either and have some very different qualities to the players under Alex Ferguson.",
      "But where there is simply no argument, is in forward areas. United trotted out a barely believable trio of Wayne Rooney, Carlos Tevez and…Cristiano Ronaldo. If Arteta had any one of those players, they would be 15 points clear and near-certainties to win the Champions League. And that is where this debate ends.",
      "Call me a slave to nostalgia, but I'm taking that United side everyday of the week.",
      "A useful starting point in these sorts of debates is the trophy cabinet. A quick glance reveals that Manchester United won the Premier League, League Cup and the Club World Cup in the 2008/09 season, while finishing as runners-up in the Champions League and semi-finalists in the FA Cup. While Arsenal are still in all four competitions this season, they are yet to have their name inscribed on any silverware, so sweeping assessments are premature.",
      "United's squad contained some all-time great players: Edwin van der Sar, Rio Ferdinand, Michael Carrick, Paul Scholes, Ryan Giggs, Wayne Rooney and Cristiano Ronaldo. Arsenal's contains some exceptional stars of the present: Gabriel Magalhaes, Declan Rice and Bukayo Saka.",
      "The only way I can see Arsenal's current vintage coming out on top is if they end the 2025/26 season with multiple trophies. Right now, though, they still have some way to go until they can considered the equals of those who have actually been there and done it.",
      "Arsenal's strength in depth has been to clear for all to see this season(Image: Photo by David Price/Arsenal FC via Getty Images)",
      "First and foremost, these questions are already tedious. 'Maradona or Messi?' 'Van Dijk or Vidic?' You'll never find an answering comparing different eras, but let's try.",
      "United had the firepower to beat anyone in the world that season - and the two campaigns either side. In a one-off fixture, they'd likely batter Arsenal as Rooney says.",
      "Over the course of a season, however, Arsenal would stand a better chance of winning the Premier League. Their squad depth is borderline obscene and with William Saliba and Gabriel Magalhaes, they're a match for Rio Ferdinand and Nemanja Vidic.",
      "Overall, though, I'd pick United. We've got the evidence with them, whereas it won't be until May when we find out how good Arsenal really are.",

      "Loftus-Cheek, 29, is no stranger to Premier League teams after coming through the academy ranks at Stamford Bridge and boasts over 150 top-flight appearances to his name from his time with the Blues and loan spells at Crystal Palace and Fulham. The midfielder, who was handed an England recall by Thomas Tuchel last September, moved to AC Milan in the summer of 2023.",
      "Loftus-Cheek has gone on to make over 90 appearances for the Italian giants but could be loaned out this month after falling down the pecking order at the San Siro, with Villa now considering a move to bring him in.",

      "Villa were courting Loftus-Cheek's former Chelsea team-mate, Conor Gallagher, earlier this month, only for Tottenham to sign the England star from Atletico Madrid in a permanent deal. Loftus-Cheek, if signed, represent a ready-made replacement for the injured Kamara with Premier League pedigree.",

      "The former defender's arrival came just months after departing his position as loans manager. He's linked up with Steve Holland, Jonathan Woodgate and Travis Binnion on the coaching staff for the remainder of the season, a decision that has raised eyebrows from Keane.",
      "In footage posted on X by United, Maguire said: \"He's a great guy, he's really calm, a real good player. When I speak about underrated players, I'd say Jonny for me was probably the most underrated player I have ever played with.",
      "\"If I was a young boy and I was teaching someone to watch defending and watch body positioning and watch movement, I'd say watch Jonny Evans, he was that good at his body positioning and the way that he's so active in every part of the game.",

      "United are hopeful that Evans can impart his wisdom to the defenders on the training ground for the remainder of the season. However, his appointment led to some questions from Keane.",

      "Scott McTominay managed to avoid the ire of the Italian press following Napoli's \"unacceptable\" draw with Copenhagen. The Champions League future of the Serie A team is in jeopardy after they were held to a draw by the Danish champions, who were down to 10 men after Thomas Delaney was sent off on the 35-minute mark.",
      "Former Manchester United midfielder McTominay quickly put the visitors in the lead with his fourth goal in five matches, but Copenhagen rescued a point thanks to a Jordan Larsson goal with 18 minutes left.",
      "The result was a missed opportunity for Napoli, with much of the team, including United loanees Rasmus Hojlund, facing criticism from the Italian media. However, McTominay was largely seen as the standout player of the match, with both Il Messaggero and Gazzetta awarding him a top-of-the-class 7/10.",
      "Rome-based Il Messaggero described him as \"absolutely decisive,\" adding: \"He grew as the minutes went by and broke the deadlock, confirming his key role in the Champions League.\"",
      "The same publication gave ex-Copenhagen forward Hojlund, who was surprisingly jeered by the home crowd, a score of 5/10 and commented that he \"struggles too much.\"",
      "McTominay celebrates his latest goal(Image: SSC NAPOLI via Getty Images)",
      "Meanwhile, Corriere Della Sera noted about Hojlund: \"He came close to scoring several times, but as the minutes passed, he grew nervous.\"",
      "Viewers also made their opinions known, with McTominay being voted player of the match on the Eurosport website with 59 per cent of the vote. This would have been little consolation to the 29-year-old, who didn't mince words about the performance.",
      "Speaking to Sky Sport Italia, he expressed his frustration, saying: \"We should have won that game, it's unacceptable. We should have scored the second and third goals to close out the game, even if it was a difficult surface. It's really disappointing that we didn't.",
      "\"We've had a lot of injuries, but we've still tried to improve game by game. The subs have come on and done well, but we have to do even better.\"",

      "Clubs finishing outside the top 24 will be eliminated, meaning Napoli must secure a victory in their final league match against Chelsea next week to guarantee a spot in the play-off round.",
      "McTominay added: \"Obviously, this game has just ended and we have to look at the mistakes and try to improve. Chelsea are an excellent team. We have to try and give everything to improve in the Champions League. We have to be at our best.\"",

      "Lisandro Martinez has hit back at comments made by Nicky Butt and Paul Scholes.(Image: Getty Images)",
      "Manchester United stars are worried by the behaviour of the club's former players in the media - with anger becoming increasingly public.",
      "Lisandro Martinez called out Nicky Butt and Paul Scholes over comments made last week, before the duo duly replied to the Argentine international again on Monday, with Butt telling him to 'f*****g grow up. And there's growing unease within the club that certain criticism is becoming 'too personal' following remarks from Roy Keane about Michael Carrick's wife.",
      "Now Butt has reportedly joined the new social media platform Peek, where high-profile sports personalities share their opinions, with the Daily Mail claiming Scholes is also in discussions, as they pair seek to amplify their views further afield.",
      "Butt sparked Martinez's fury after declaring in the build up to the derby that Manchester City striker Erling Haaland 'would pick Martinez up and run with him,' likening it to 'a dad after school running down the road with a little toddler.' Scholes joined in the banter, chuckling that Haaland 'would score and then throw him in the net.'",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UTD FB PAGE! Latest United news and more on our dedicated Facebook page",
      "After silencing Haaland so effectively in the derby that Pep Guardiola substituted him with 10 minutes of regular time left, Martinez responded to Scholes' remarks stating: \"Honestly, he can say whatever he wants. I told him already, if he wants to say something to me, he can come to wherever he wants - to my house, wherever. I don't care.",
      "\"And I think for me, I respect the relations when they want to help the club because everyone can talk on the television, but when you see [them] here face to face, no-one says anything in your face. So for me, I don't really care what they say. I just put the focus on my performance, the performance of the team and I give everything to this club until my last day.\"",
      "In response, Scholes posted on Instagram: \"Someone's had a good game, was really happy for you...\" In response to Martinez's invitation, he added: \"Tea, no sugar pls.\"",
      "Butt revisited the issue on The Good, The Bad & The Football podcast, commenting that such reactions were not suitable for a club like United.: \"First and foremost, he was brilliant on the day and fair play to him. He's gone out and gone man to man against probably the best centre-forward in the world, possibly.",
      "\"Him and Harry, to be fair, were brilliant, so we could come on here now and say brilliant well done. But that is what is expected from a Man United player on derby day. For me, we are a podcast, and we talk like three lads in a pub having a conversation; we are not on Sky doing commentary on a game.",
      "Paul Scholes and Nicky Butt have addressed their spat with Lisandro Martinez(Image: Getty Images)",
      "\"It is tongue in cheek, and it is quite obvious that Haaland is not going to pick him up and run with him. It is f*****g obvious. It is a figure of speech. I just think when someone gets so upset about someone in the media or on a podcast saying something about them, to come out and basically say they can say what they want, come to my house and all that, f*****g grow up.",
      "\"It is literally if you are going to get so emotional about someone saying something and come out and react like that, you shouldn't be a big football club because I am telling you now he is going to get that for the rest of his career at Manchester United. You get your ups and downs and I got so much crap when I played at Man United and Newcastle, but then next week you get your plaudits and you get clapped at. There is no personal issue with us and Martinez. None.\"",
      "Butt continued: \"He's telling us to come knock on his house. I'm f*cking 50 years of age; I'm not going knocking on someone's house saying, 'Can we have a chat?' It's just ridiculous. And, if you're going to get that precious, you better be sh*t hot every week.\"",
      "Scholes meanwhile, attempted to clarify their intended message, explaining: \"The point we were trying to make is that physically, they are a mismatch. Now look, possibly we could have worded it better. It doesn't sound brilliant when you watch it back. But we're just having a laugh about it, and if it was about you, then you'd probably be upset, but you gotta give him credit, he was brilliant on the day.",
      "\"Look, we exchanged messages on Instagram quite some time ago.Yeah, he weren't happy with something I said, I can't remember what it was, and he just said that he lost all respect for me.",
      "\"I wouldn't have said this normally, but he's come out and said stuff, so why not? He said he lost all kinds of respect for me. When we got stick as players, you look at it and remember it. We used it as fuel, you don't go answering back.\"",

      "David Beckham has sent happy birthday messages to two of his former Manchester United teammates during the ongoing row engulfing his family. The Beckham family is in turmoil following the explosive statement issued by Brooklyn in which he made several accusations about his parents.",
      "Brooklyn’s unhappiness centres around David and Victoria’s apparent attempts to control the narrative about the family and, in particular, their alleged attempts to “ruin” his relationship with wife Nicola Peltz. The famous couple’s eldest child felt he had “no choice but to speak for myself and tell the truth” about the family feud.",
      "The most eye-catching claim was that Victoria had danced very inappropriately on him at his wedding in 2022 and had also allegedly \"hijacked\" his first dance with Nicola. Brooklyn’s comments have sparked renewed frenzy around the family, but David and Victoria have both tried to continue as normal on social media.",
      "On Wednesday morning he took to Instagram to post happy birthday messages to Nicky Butt and Phil Neville on his stories, with Victoria doing the same for Spice Girls bandmate Emma Bunton. David posted “Happy birthday mate” with a heart emoji alongside a photo of him with Butt during their time together at Manchester United, as well as one reading “Birthday Boy” alongside a photo of Butt celebrating a goal.",
      "Beckham also tagged Phil Neville and his twin sister Tracey Neville, who is the former head coach of the England netball team, on a photo of the two of them with the caption “Happy Birthday you 2” with two love hearts. Phil also received another message on a photo of the two of them celebrating from their United days.",
      "David was part of the Class of 92, a famous group of United stars who came through the club’s academy and went on to have impressive careers. They were Beckham, Butt, Phil Neville, Gary Neville, Ryan Giggs and Paul Scholes.",
      "The group have remained friends and were previously all involved as owners of Salford City, although since May 2025 only Beckham and Gary Neville are still part of the ownership group. The other four are still involved in the club and still are seen attending matches.",

      "Butt recently revealed that he doesn’t like the ‘Class of 92’ tag. “I cringe when I hear it. But it is what it is. It’s what we’ve been known for since we all came through with Sir Alex Ferguson,” he said to Scholes on the Football’s Greatest podcast.",
      "“And yeah, it’s something that I do cringe about and it just becomes something probably bigger than it really was, if I’m honest with you.”",

      "Mason Greenwood has been absent from international football for almost six years(Image: Photonews, Photonews via Getty Images)",
      "Mason Greenwood's success at club level has failed to replicate itself on the international stage. The ex-Manchester United striker has proved to be one of Ligue 1's most potent finishers since signing for Marseille in 2024.",
      "The 24-year-old won the league's Golden Boot last season, alongside Ousmane Dembele, with the pair both netting 21 goals. Greenwood has continued his form in front of goal during the current campaign, leading the league in scoring with 12 goals and netting 20 across all competitions.",
      "Prior to his £23million move to France, Greenwood was charged with rape, assault and controlling and coercive behaviour in 2022 before the charges were later dropped. Greenwood denied all allegations.",
      "During his time at United, he was regarded as a player who would star for club and country for years to come and even made his England debut in 2020 - his sole cap for the Three Lions.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UTD FB PAGE! ** Latest United news and more on our dedicated Facebook page**",
      "However, his legal issues ended his international career with England, and he has yet to be recalled to the squad. Ahead of Euro 2024, former national team boss Gareth Southgate said outright he wouldn't consider Greenwood, and current manager Thomas Tuchel previously admitted the forward was \"not in his thoughts\".",
      "The German said last year: \"I have not spoken to him until now. I have not spoken to him or his camp. My understanding was that he tries to play for Jamaica so we didn't give it another thought. He was not in the mix at the moment, and he is not in our thoughts for our team.\"",
      "Despite Greenwood filing papers in order to switch his international eligibility to Jamaica, he's yet to make his debut for the country, even after he was as expected to be available for selection for Jamaica's World Cup 2026 qualifiers against Bermuda and Trinidad and Tobago last September.",
      "Mason Greenwood has not played for England since 2020(Image: PA)",
      "With 42 goals in 62 games for Marseille, Greenwood has certainly been a bargain for the French giants, who paid United an extra £5m last season due to clinching Champions League football.",
      "The financial victories from selling Greenwood could yet still continue for the Red Devils, who inserted a staggering 40 per cent sell-on clause in his Marseille contract. Should the Ligue 1 side sell him, United will receive almost half of the profit from the transfer fee.",
      "Thomas Tuchel previously admitted he has no plans to recall Greenwood to the England squad(Image: Justin Setterfield/Getty Images)",
      "After playing a part in his side's 2-1 win against Newcastle United in November, an English opponent awaits Greenwood again as Liverpool travel to the Stade Velodrome this Wednesday. The striker has scored just once against the Reds in five games, with his lone strike coming in a 3-2 win for United against their rivals in the FA Cup fourth round in 2021.",

      "The days are ticking down in the January transfer window, with Manchester United among those actively looking in the market at potential deals. The club are weighing up options that could help them in the short term and the long term, with a particular focus on the groundwork that can be done for the summer.",
      "In the meantime, Michael Carrick will largely work with what he has to try and get Man United as high up the table as possible in his caretaker manager stint. That should help set the team up for the future, whether that is under the current staff at Old Trafford or under new leadership with a change in head coach.",
      "Either way, director of football Jason Wilcox is already starting to take a look at the options he can bring in to help improve the side in the weeks and months ahead. So, with that being said, here's a look at the latest Manchester United transfer news and rumours ahead of another busy day.",
      "Manchester United could have a transfer battle on their hands if they push forward with their reported interest in Ruben Neves in the near future. According to Spanish outlet AS, Real Madrid are also taking a keen interest in the midfielder as a possible option for the summer transfer window, though the player is looking at a possible move in January.",
      "The former Wolves star is currently playing for Al-Hilal in Saudi Arabia, but has just six months remaining on his contract with the club. That has sparked interest in a possible return to Europe, with the 28-year-old now entering what are the peak years of his playing career.",
      "A pre-contract agreement can be reached by clubs this month, up until he becomes a free agent in the summer, but it remains to be seen if any club will manage that. Man United's own interest comes at a time when they are keen to transform their midfield ranks, with Neves one of many potential targets.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UTD FB PAGE! Latest United news and more on our dedicated Facebook page",
      "Manchester United have been offered the chance to sign Ruben Loftus-Cheek this January transfer window, as an option to improve their midfield ranks. That's reported by talkSPORT, who claim that the club are considering a potential loan signing in midfield this winter to help bolster their options.",
      "Loftus-Cheek is said to be keen on making a move back to the Premier League, having struggled to feature regularly for AC Milan this season. The former Chelsea man was involved for England last year, making his return after a few years out of the setup, but will be keen to play more before the World Cup.",
      "While Loftus-Cheek is one option, the report adds that former Leicester City midfielder Wilfred Ndidi is also on Man United's radar this winter.",
      "Ruben Loftus-Cheek has been linked with a move to Manchester United(Image: (Photo by Mairo Cinquetti/NurPhoto via Getty Images))",
      "Manchester United have been linked with a potential move for Jean-Philippe Mateta in the transfer window, but could miss out to Premier League rivals Aston Villa. That's because The Athletic reports that the Villans have expressed their interest in the striker this month.",
      "It's claimed that the club are looking to bolster their forward ranks, with Mateta an option as he enters the final 18 months of his deal at Crystal Palace. The Eagles hold their own interest in Evann Guessand, which could open the path towards a swap deal in the weeks ahead.",
      "That may well take away a potential option for Man United, if they are looking to act on their striker transfer interest this winter, or even in the summer. Palace boss Oliver Glasner admitted last week that the club are open to a sale if the financial interests come forward in the transfer market.",
      "\"There will be a price where Crystal Palace say '18 months left in his contract, we do the deal if JP wants',\" Glasner admitted. \"If nobody pays this price then JP will stay.\"",

      "Ruben Amorim once briefly stopped by to watch part of an academy fixture at Carrington, but he failed to commit to properly attending a youth match throughout his one-and-a-half-year reign. His predecessor, Erik ten Hag, did turn up to watch an U21 fixture at Altrincham in September 2022.",

Towards the conclusion of Amorim's reign, he attracted criticism when he claimed Harry Amass was \"struggling\" on loan in the Championship and highlighted Chido Obi not featuring in every U21 match.",

      "Ruben Neves has recently set his sights set on a dream move to Real Madrid this month despite continued links to Manchester United and a possible return to the Premier League.",
      "The former Wolves playmaker, 28, currently plies his trade in Saudi Arabia after joining Al-Hilal back in the summer of 2023. But with Neves' contract up in the summer, he is understood to have suitors who are ready to bring him back to Europe before the end of the 2025-26 campaign.",
      "Manchester United are among those who have been linked and the Red Devils are looking for midfield reinforcements. It has now emerged, though, that Neves has eyes for another club amid interest from Old Trafford.",
      "According to Carrusel Deportivo, via AS, Neves has been identified as a target by staff at Real, who feel they need to sign a creative midfielder. Neves, despite having a lucrative contract offer on the table from Al-Hilal, is keen on the move - but not everybody is.",
      "The report adds that the Real Madrid board 'have doubts' over Neves and that the fact they would be able to land him on a free transfer in the summer means they would be unwilling to pay a substantial fee to sign him, making a deal unlikely.",
      "Neves boasts Premier League experience from his time with Wolves(Image: Getty Images)",
      "With Real not planning to do any significant deal during the current transfer window, Neves could decide to see out the remainder of his deal and assess all options in the summer.",

They have since replaced him with Michael Carrick but the former United midfielder is only on a contract until the end of the season, at which point they are expected to recruit Amorim's permanent successor.",

      "Ruben Amorim insisted on doing everything his way at Manchester United, which meant he ignored some easy wins, like making the effort to attend an academy game to show support for the club's young players. Amorim once walked over to observe some of an academy match at Carrington, but he did not make the effort to properly watch a youth game during his one-and-a-half-year tenure.",
      "Michael Carrick was appointed as interim last week and attended an Under-21 match just seven days later, sitting alongside Steve Holland, Jonathan Woodgate and Travis Binnion. Jason Wilcox, director of football, and head of the academy, Stephen Torpey, were present, while Darren Fletcher also attended after returning to his role as Under-18 following a brief stint as caretaker.",
      "It might not seem important that Carrick and his backroom staff made the effort to attend, but the truth is their presence is a symbol of support for the youth system and highlights that there is a pathway. Carrick planned to speak to the Under-21s after their game against Sporting Lisbon, another classy touch from United's interim head coach. Some academy players were disillusioned with Amorim's comments in the media, but Carrick has sought to provide encouragement in his first week in the job.",
      "Fletcher spoke passionately as he defended the academy in a recent press conference, and Carrick is expected to pick up that baton, despite only having assurances of the job until the end of the season for now. Carrick made 464 United appearances and understands the club's finest teams across the decades have included academy players. Followers of the academy argued that understanding was not there with Amorim.",
      "Carrick made an effort to attend the game.(Image: )",
      "Amorim overstepped the mark when he suggested Harry Amass was \"struggling\" on loan in the Championship, pointed to Chido Obi not starting every U21 game and namedropped Toby Collyer unprompted. The level-headed Carrick is guaranteed not to make such headlines.",
      "And Carrick was treated to a thoroughly entertaining first half at Leigh Sports Village, which saw James Scanlon score twice to give United a 2-1 advantage against Sporting. Woodgate was spotted pointing at the team sheet at the interval and might well have been saying 'the goalscorer looks like a good player'.",
      "Scanlon has already made a handful of senior international appearances for Gibraltar, who he qualifies to represent through his mother, and he has clearly outgrown academy football, which was further illustrated by him completing his hat-trick in the second half with a clinical finish in the box. Torpey is looking after loans after Evans' decision to step down from his role as head of loans and pathways, and he should arrange a move away for Scanlon before the end of the January transfer window.",
      "Tyler Fredricson wore the captain's armband against Sporting, a few days after sitting alongside Joshua Zirkzee and Matthijs de Ligt to watch the Manchester derby in the directors' box. From the players who started against Sporting, Fredricson is another obvious candidate for a loan in the second half of the campaign. The youngster has been given just two first-team minutes since being hooked against Grimsby Town in August and would benefit from playing in a competitive environment.",
      "Scanlon scored a hat-trick against Sporting.(Image: 2026 Manchester United FC)",
      "Carrick got a first glimpse of the Fletcher brothers in action. Jack Fletcher played from the bench in successive Premier League games against Aston Villa, Newcastle and Wolves in December, and he would have seen Sporting as an audition for further opportunities now Carrick has taken charge of the team.",
      "Tyler Fletcher has made three matchday squads in the Premier League without getting a chance to make his debut. He will look at what his twin brother has achieved and be motivated to do the same.",
      "It will be interesting to see how much Carrick uses academy prospects, given he has a practically full-strength squad at his disposal and just 16 games remaining in the topflight this season.",
      "Only the best young players from the academy will be able to earn minutes and Shea Lacey is the favourite to stay around Carrick's senior squad. He was not involved against Sporting after training with the first-team at Carrington, and he currently has the wind behind his sails after two bright cameos.",
      "United ultimately claimed a 3-2 victory against Sporting, but they will only learn whether they progress to the knockout rounds of the Premier League International Cup when the remaining group games are played. Carrick was at least treated to a five-goal thriller and a hat-trick from the talented Scanlon at Leigh.",

      "After beating Manchester City, Michael Carrick was pictured with his arm around Benjamin Sesko. It was as if Carrick was saying 'don't worry, you're going to be an important part of my plans this season'.",
      "Sesko had scored three goals in his last two matches for Manchester United, but Carrick decided to name him on the bench in favour of playing with a striker-less front three against City.",
      "The Slovenia international would have been disappointed to lose his starting place and not even get off the bench in the Manchester derby, however, Carrick got every aspect of his team selection correct.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FACEBOOK PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "It was heartening to see Carrick make a beeline for Sesko during the celebrations. The 44-year-old was a player himself and knows what it feels like to be dropped. Sesko would have appreciated the gesture from Carrick, who demonstrated his man-management skills in that brief moment.",
      "It felt like Sesko was coming to the boil just in time for the Manchester derby, and he will be desperate to continue his momentum when he receives the opportunity to feature again. His brace in the 2-2 draw against Burnley was brilliant and he followed that with a headed goal against Brighton in the FA Cup. Darren Fletcher was in charge as caretaker for both of those games, and he'd taken time to speak to Sesko individually before United's visit to Lancashire.",
      "\"I sat down with him yesterday and showed him some videos of his movement and how the opportunities are going to come, to just keep believing, keep making the runs,\" said Fletcher.",
      "\"The rest of the team have to look for him more as well. Like with all strikers, once you get that first goal, it builds your confidence, and hopefully they start flooding in from there. I think everyone can see his qualities.",
      "\"I thought he was fantastic tonight. I thought he led the line really well and he maybe could have gone on and had a hat-trick as well. He had a few other opportunities there, another snapshot. It's a real positive night for him and definitely probably the biggest positive from the night really is his two goals.\"",
      "Sesko scored twice against Burnley.(Image: )",
      "When Fletcher subsequently spoke at Carrington, he played down his involvement in Sesko's brace, saying: \"He's the one who crossed the white line and did it for himself.",
      "\"I said we showed some video, but Ben has been working really, really hard. He's a really diligent lad, he trains well and he reviews his games meticulously, so he's been striving for that moment. I'm just fortunate that it came in the game I was in charge of, so I'm more than happy for him.\"",
      "United need an in-form Sesko to qualify for the Champions League this season, which must be the target, and Carrick will now try to coax further improvement from the 22-year-old.",
      "Speaking ahead of the Manchester derby, Carrick admitted he enjoys the challenge of improving players. \"Helping individuals is a big part of what I enjoy. I think if you improve the individuals, then you create a better team,\" he said, and helping Sesko wouldn't be a bad place to start.",
      "Carrick knew what he was doing by putting an arm around Sesko and having a quiet word in his ear last weekend. The centre-forward is hoping to end his first season at the club as strongly as possible.",

It is a graveyard for players and coaches. Many players leave United and suddenly play well again. Manchester United need to look at themselves and what’s really going on there. What is the vibe? The vibe there is not good. But if you don't have the players, what do you do?”",

      "Kobbie Mainoo has the chance of a fresh start at Manchester United and he looks ready to take it(Image: )",
      "The sight of Kobbie Mainoo shimmying away from Antoine Semenyo near the halfway line at Old Trafford on Saturday was a valuable reminder of the technical quality possessed by the Manchester United midfielder. It was also a jolting reminder that, somehow, Mainoo was making his first Premier League start of the season on January 17.",
      "There is little desire to go back over the wreckage of the Ruben Amorim era now but had the Portuguese head coach not taken a wrecking ball to his position at the turn of the year, perhaps he would have limped on further into this season. Had that happened, then who knows where Mainoo would be now.",
      "Amorim always insisted that Mainoo was competing with Bruno Fernandes for a place in his team. Against Manchester City, the 20-year-old academy graduate and the 31-year-old captain co-existed perfectly in a finely balanced midfield.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FACEBOOK PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "That didn't seem likely a month ago. Had Amorim survived this month, then it is possible, maybe even probable, that Mainoo would have been forced to look elsewhere. A permanent exit was never on the cards, but he wanted to move to Napoli on the final day of the summer transfer window and the Italian champions remained keen.",
      "Any chance of a mid-season exit is now off the table. The embrace between Mainoo and Michael Carrick at full-time on Saturday was a visual sign of the faith the new head coach has shown in a young player whose confidence has taken a battering and development has stalled.",
      "Carrick said Mainoo was \"great\" in the 2-0 win and praised him for laying a platform alongside Casemiro. It's easy to remember how the pair of them often struggled together under Erik ten Hag, but this was evidence that if the structure is right, they can play together.",
      "There is competition still in that midfield. Manuel Ugarte has interest from abroad but will stay put for the rest of the season and Mason Mount will want to force his way back in, but it would be a surprise if Mainoo isn't starting between Casemiro and Fernandes for the next couple of weeks, at least.",
      "As promising a trio as that is, it's also one with uncertainty. Casemiro is out of contract this summer and although the one-year option in his contract will be triggered if he starts all 16 remaining Premier League games, that is very unlikely to happen. Fernandes has again put the focus on his own future recently, and he might have a decision to make in the summer.",
      "Mainoo looks the safest bet for the long-term, and the Stockport-born midfielder should be a United player for years to come. But while the departure of Amorim is one obstacle out of the way, contract talks between his camp and the club haven't gone smoothly.",
      "Although some performance bonuses have been triggered, Mainoo remains on the deal he signed in February 2023, when he was 17. It doesn't reflect the status he believes he now holds and if he does emerge from the second half of the season as a first-choice midfielder, that will again need revisiting.",
      "That deal expires at the end of next season and although United have the option to extend it by 12 months, it will go down as a failure if that is required. New and improved terms should be sorted by this summer.",
      "The onus is partly on Mainoo to show he is deserving of the pay rise he believes he warrants. He certainly looked it on Saturday. If that level is maintained, then director of football Jason Wilcox will have to act. He is the key figure in contract decisions now and it would now be a good look for an academy graduate at Mainoo's level to enter the final 12 months.",
      "There has been plenty of uncertainty around Mainoo over the last 12 months, but Saturday felt like a fresh start. That should give everyone involved the impetus to sort out his long-term future before the summer transfer window kicks into gear.",

      "Carrick was joined by his assistant, Steve Holland, and first-team coaches Jonathan Woodgate and Travis Binnion, who all sat together in a suite at Leigh Sports Village.",

      "Stephen Torpey, head of the academy, was also spotted on Tuesday. Torpey has looked after academy loans since Evans stepped down as head of loans and pathways last month.",
      "Amorim's lack of support for the academy did not go unnoticed, and fans questioned his faith in young players. Toward the end of Amorim's tenure, he made headlines when he suggested Harry Amass was \"struggling\" on loan in the Championship and pointed to Chido Obi not starting every U21 game.",
      "When asked whether Kobbie Mainoo could change his mind and earn a starting role, Amorim, without any prompting, said: \"[Harry] Amass is now struggling in the Championship. Chido is not always a starter in U21s. All these guys played when a lot of people were saying sack the manager.\"",
      "Amorim also mentioned Toby Collyer in the press conference, saying: \"He’s from the academy, he played here, went to West Bromwich, he’s not playing. He played for Manchester United.\"",

Manchester United looked like a completely different team as they put Manchester City to the sword. They played their game instead of City's and were rewarded for it.",
      "The reaction to Carrick's impact on this United team has been overwhelmingly positive but tinged with caution. While Ineos may not have been in charge of football operations at the time, they are fully aware of the dangers of appointing an interim to the full-time position.",
      "One brilliant result will not define whether Carrick is a realistic permanent appointment so, until a final decision is made, the search will continue for Ruben Amorim's long-term replacement. This week, Jamie Carragher weighed into the debate on who the permanent United head coach should be and named one of the more popular options on the market.",

      "Considering his stature in the game, many believe Tuchel will be on the hunt for a domestic position after the World Cup and he could have plenty of suitors if the Three Lions do well. Ineos are believed to think highly of the former Chelsea head coach and it is easy to see why.",
      "\"He's gone into the England squad and he's ruffled feathers with some of the biggest players there. Now I'm not saying that has to happen in every job he's in, but there's something about him. He just feels like he would go to war for your club, and he'd be fighting against the other clubs, and he'd have something about him.\"",
      "But if United are to appoint Tuchel, they already know what they will need to do. In July 2022, the 52-year-old sent a message to the Chelsea board. Less than two months later, he was gone.",
      "Thomas Tuchel pictured shortly before leaving Chelsea(Image: )",
      "After facing Arsenal in pre-season, he said: \"The last week proves my point. I would absolutely prefer not to be right. I did everything to prove myself wrong but at the moment I feel that I was right.",
      "\"I look at the last season and parts of the game where we struggled, parts of the season where we struggled, and then we got sanctioned and players left us and some players are trying to leave us, and this is where it is.",
      "\"So we had an urgent appeal for quality players, a huge amount of quality players. We got two quality players but we are not competitive like this. Unfortunately you could see it today.\"",
      "While United are highly unlikely to be hit by the same sanctions which necessitated Chelsea's rebuild, if Tuchel was appointed, he would be keen to overhaul the squad in his image. The German played a 3-4-2-1 system for the most part at Stamford Bridge but Amorim made it clear the current crop of players were not right for this tactic to compete.",
      "Many feel international management suits Tuchel because he has full control on which players are in his squad, and which are not. But to avoid a tenure at Old Trafford which crashes in on itself, like it did at Chelsea, United's hierarchy must know they would need to give him more control than Amorim was afforded.",
      "This is why the United vacancy will be so difficult for Ineos to fill, especially if they want a manager of the calibre of Tuchel. We are no longer in the era of Sir Alex Ferguson where a manager controls every aspect of the club - it is simply not feasible anymore.",
      "But Ineos would need to give Tuchel what he wants in the transfer window and more of a say in recruitment. It remains to be seen if United are willing to relinquish some of their power though to hire a proven winner.",

      "Oliver Glasner launched a stunning attack on his Crystal Palace bosses as he prepares to leave Selhurst Park(Image: )",
      "Having just got rid of one combustible head coach who rarely sticks to the script in public, Manchester United won't be rushing to appoint another. That's why Oliver Glasner's remarkable rant against his Crystal Palace bosses after defeat at Sunderland on Saturday was such a risk.",
      "Glasner's candidancy for the Old Trafford hotseat has dimmed a little in recent weeks, a downturn in results at Selhurst Park not helping him at a time when he needs his stock to be climbing. So getting the flamethrower out at the Stadium of Light on Saturday was an interesting strategy.",
      "Palace had just made it 10 games without a win when Glasner took studious aim at those above him for doing a deal with Manchester City for captain Marc Guehi on the eve of the game. Glasner had confirmed on Friday that he was leaving Selhurst Park at the end of the season, and much like Ruben Amorim did in his final weekend at Old Trafford, the Austrian decided one public meltdown wasn't quite enough.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FACEBOOK PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "\"The players gave everything they could. We made no substitutions - look at the bench, there are just kids there,\" he said. \"We feel like we're being abandoned completely. Selling our captain one day before a game - there is no understanding for this.",
      "\"We are preparing and then yesterday [Friday], I get told that our captain will be sold, but why not next week? At least he can play this game and then next week, other players are coming back. It makes me really upset.",
      "\"If your heart gets ripped out twice a year, with [Eberechi] Eze one day before a game in the summer and your captain one day before a game - I've just got no understanding.",
      "\"I've been in football for 30 years and never experienced this, not once. Now it happens twice in six or seven months. That's just where we are now.\"",
      "This is a remarkable attack on the club employing him and the comparisons with Amorim's stunning broadside at United executives at Leeds earlier this month are obvious. Amorim's position became untenable after his remarks, but Palace seem determined to limp on with the manager who only eight months ago won them their first major trophy.",
      "Ruben Amorim could be a loose cannon in press conferences at Manchester United(Image: Ash Donelon/Manchester United via Getty Images)",
      "In truth, this has probably been coming all season. Glasner threatened to quit at the end of the summer transfer window if Guehi was sold to Liverpool. He won the battle that day, but he was never going to win the war. Palace's business model doesn't allow players of Guehi's quality to leave for free, so City's £20million offer was £20million they couldn't afford to turn down.",
      "None of this should really come as a surprise. Palace chairman Steve Parish has made the business plan clear often enough. Glasner referenced Eberechi Eze as well, but that was another transfer that looked a certainty all summer and is just what clubs like Palace have to do.",
      "It is depressing for Glasner, depressing for Palace, and depressing for most football fans that any club with the cheek to lay down a challenge to the elite soon finds the vultures circling overhead.",
      "This is what happens when a hungry and ambitious manager ends up taking charge at one of the Premier League's upwardly mobile, middle-class clubs. Andoni Iraola probably deserves more credit than he is getting for biting his tongue at Bournemouth when his players are sold from under him as well.",
      "Glasner and Iraola are two of the standout candidates for the Old Trafford vacancy, but are now balancing disappointing runs of form at the worst possible time, and both have lost their best player during January. You can understand the frustration.",
      "Bournemouth and Crystal Palace have sold Antoine Semenyo and Marc Guehi in January(Image: )",
      "Granted, Glasner does have history here. He left Eintracht Frankfurt after disagreements with sporting director Markus Krosche over the strength of the squad, and at Wolfsburg, he clashed with Jorg Schmadtke over what he felt were broken promises to improve the squad.",
      "The common theme here is a manager pushing for more at clubs whose natural habitat is the middle ground. Is that enough to cast the 51-year-old as a loose cannon, or does a CV including a Europa League with Eintracht Frankfurt and an FA Cup with Crystal Palace suggest he has earned a crack at the highest level?",
      "His ambitions would be easier to meet at an elite club, while he's hardly alone in being a manager or a head coach who sometimes disagrees with those above him. The challenge for Omar Berrada and Jason Wilcox at United would be to manage that kind of personality rather than fall into the trap of a compliant yes-man.",
      "That's not to say Glasner is the outstanding candidate here. His CV does make him deserving of a crack at a bigger job, but there are concerns. Top of the list is that his best results have come with a back three, a system United will want to steer clear of. Recent results at Palace have also cost the club and Glasner momentum.",
      "Those are reasons for Berrada and Wilcox to think twice about approaching a manager who is on the market this summer and has Premier League experience. Worrying about what a boss with ambitions beyond the likes of Crystal Palace and Eintracht Frankfurt might say in public is not.",

      "Michael Carrick may as well have been lauded as a tactical genius after Manchester United produced a performance which shocked the Premier League to beat Manchester City 2-0 at Old Trafford. On another day, had it not been for marginal offsides and some incredible reflex stops by Gianluigi Donnarumma, it could have been more.",
      "But United fans are not greedy, particularly after a performance that inspiring, and the hope is there that they can continue this form as they push for a spot in the top four. The game plan Carrick implemented against City was not expected considering how he liked his Middlesbrough team to dominate the ball in the Championship.",
      "However, he was pragmatic and had confidence his defence could keep out City's threats and hit them on the counter attack. This tactic worked to perfection. Senne Lammens made one ill-advised save for a shot that was going well off target but otherwise, had nothing to do.",
      "Meanwhile, at the other end, the Reds had ten shots, seven of which were on target. It was a case of quality over quantity and all of this came from just 32 per cent possession. The beauty of Carrick's game plan was how positive it was without the need to dominate the ball.",
      "United were patient, picked their moments and deserved the victory. While this game plan will need changing for matches against teams who the Reds, on paper, should be dominant over, they can copy and paste it for the clash with Arsenal on Sunday.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FB PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "At Nottingham Forest this weekend, Arsenal had 60 per cent possession and tried their best to break down their opponents only to settle for a point. United sitting deep and then playing with pace on the break is arguably their best chance of stopping the runaway leaders.",
      "Mikel Arteta will be mindful of this but it is one thing knowing what is about to come, and another thing stopping it. However, what United need to be wary of, which they did not have to concern themselves with against City, is the Gunners' threat from set pieces.",
      "All the way back on the opening day of the season, United managed to hold their own against the north London club only to be caught out by a corner. There were suspicions of a foul which were waved away but Altay Bayindir was not strong enough and the goal was a poor one to concede.",
      "Last season, United were atrocious when it came to defending set pieces but they have managed to make some progress in the 2025/26 season. Lammens seems more commanding in the area and as a result, goals being conceded in this manner have dropped.",
      "But Arsenal are the specialists and you would expect this week, Carrick will be drilling in the importance of being alert at all times and how each set piece routine is a huge threat. The Gunners have the best squad in the Premier League and they are also a more physical side to most.",
      "Gabriel and William Saliba are wrecking balls at corners and United need to stand up and be counted. That is why you would expect Harry Maguire to start thanks to his aerial abilities.",
      "United have been accused of having a soft underbelly in the past but if they can replicate what they did against City at the Emirates Stadium, they will banish those criticisms.",

      "Benjamin Sesko, Bryan Mbeumo, Matheus Cunha, Amad and Zirkzee are the only senior forwards at United. Sesko was sidelined in November with a knee injury, while Cunha has missed three games this season.",
      "Zirkzee has made 16 appearances for United in all competitions this term.",

      "Casemiro and Diogo Dalot cel;ebrate Bryan Mbeumo's goal against Manchester City(Image: )",
      "It was *only* the League Cup but Manchester United's victory against Newcastle United at Wembley on the final weekend of February 2023 felt like so much more. It was a first trophy in six years and came just days after Barcelona had been vanquished at Old Trafford. There haven't been many better weeks for this club in recent history.",
      "It really did feel at the time like Erik ten Hag had got it sussed - which in itself is a reminder that nobody should be getting carried away now - and there are a few scenes from that final that still linger in the memory. A couple of them feature Casemiro.",
      "Given the highs and lows he has experienced at Old Trafford since a £70million move from Real Madrid, it is easy to forget now just how good the Brazil international was in his first season. But it wasn't just the quality of his football that stood out, it was the whole package.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FACEBOOK PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "At one point at Wembley, with United 2-0 up and the clock ticking towards half-time, Casemiro forced Joelinton out of play to earn a goal kick and celebrated wildly in front of the fans behind that goal. He turned back to the pitch and exchanged high fives and chest bumps with Diogo Dalot, Raphael Varane and Lisandro Martinez.",
      "Then, with the game in its dying stages and the United fans already celebrating, Casemiro let rip at Bruno Fernandes for not passing. It was still 2-0, the game was done, but in the eyes of a five-time Champions League winner, the decision of Fernandes not to pass to a teammate in a better position was still worthy of admonishment.",
      "A few days later Ten Hag was asked about Casemiro and his answers told us a lot about why United had spent so much money on a player entering his 30s, a decision that would later be questioned by Sir Jim Ratcliffe as he put together his investment into the club.",
      "Ten Hag explained he had wanted players with \"character\" and \"personality\" in his first transfer window and said Casemiro was already the man who set the standards at United. His argument with Fernandes at Wembley showed that \"good isn't good enough\".",
      "\"For me it’s always the same, you have players who win, and who win always, and players who lose and are always losing,\" said Ten Hag. \"You have to do your research and find the type who will win and who are cooperative in the dressing room, to be humble, but when on the pitch they take responsibility.\"",
      "That summed up Casemiro at the time and although his influence waned when it appeared his legs had gone, his performance against Manchester City on Saturday was a reminder that at his best, he is still a setter of standards and a winner at heart.",
      "In May 2024, Jamie Carragher famously said of Casemiro that \"football's left him at this top level\". Over the past 18 months he has managed to rediscover it and prove he still has a role to play, but it feels like the clock is ticking on his United career.",
      "His contract expires at the end of this season and a renewal isn't looking likely at the moment. There is a one-year option on that deal which will be triggered if he starts 35 games this season, a tally he will hit if he starts all of the remaining 16 games. That is considered extremely unlikely and given the option would mean Casemiro's deal extends for another year on his £350,000-a-week salary if United are in the Champions League, it is almost impossible to see happening.",
      "If there is any chance of the holding midfielder staying, it is only on reduced wages, but as it stands, a departure at the end of the season seems most likely, although the churn in midfield could have a part to play in any decision. Bruno Fernandes' future is uncertain, as is that of Manuel Ugarte, who has interest from Europe this month and is yet to establish himself at United.",
      "It does feel like this might be the time to say goodbye, however. Casemiro turns 34 next month and United's midfield needs a rebuild. His salary has dropped to closer to £300,000-a-week due to the lack of European football, but that is a big sum that could be reinvested in a younger midfielder. It's more than £14million a season.",
      "There is no doubt he would be missed. As good as he was on Saturday, the Casemiro scenes that made their way to social media were after he had been taken off. He celebrated Mason Mount's disallowed goal by jumping on Michael Carrick's back and then running on to the pitch for a big embrace with Martinez.",
      "The Brazilian and Argentine arrived in the same summer and both fitted the bill for \"character\" and \"personality\". Nearly four years later, they keep delivering on that front.",

      "Bryan Mbeumo is making a similar impact to Bruno Fernandes at Manchester United(Image: )",
      "The debate over Manchester United's best signing since the end of the Sir Alex Ferguson era is a short one. Bruno Fernandes stands head and shoulders above the rest in just about every category imaginable.",
      "The Portuguese is a big game player who has delivered time and again when it matters most. For quality, for impact, for longevity, he ticks every box. At the end of next week, he will celebrate six years at Old Trafford and he is still the best player at the club.",
      "United paid an initial £47million to sign Fernandes from Sporting and even if that fee rises to the potential £67million if every add-on is met, it will still be exceptional value. The 31-year-old could yet be approaching the endgame at Old Trafford, but if he does depart, it will leave a significant hole in the team.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FACEBOOK PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "Fernandes stands out for his quality, but also for his rarity. United's recruitment had been haphazard over the last 13 years and there haven't been anywhere near enough success stories to match Fernandes.",
      "Zlatan Ibrahimovic was a good free transfer, but his impact was short-term. Luke Shaw looks a good deal because of the length of time he has survived at the club. Ander Herrera was a solid acquisition, so too Casemiro, although his fee was big for a 30-year-old. Lisandro Martinez might be up there but for the bad luck he has suffered with injuries.",
      "It is early days, but United's summer spending spree looks like a better investment. Senne Lammens has been good, Matheus Cunha has flickered and Benjamin Sesko has shown promise for a young striker. But Bryan Mbeumo sticks out above them all.",
      "The 26-year-old produced another exceptional attacking display in Saturday's derby victory, taking his goal superbly and running himself into the ground in a centre-forward role that demanded he pull City's defenders out of position. Mbeumo forced Gianluigi Donnarumma into an excellent save and looked to be relishing the big occasion.",
      "He has made a habit of that since his initial £65million move from Brentford in the summer. The question for players when they make a step up of that size is how they will cope in the harsher spotlight. Mbeumo had Premier League experience, but a CV consisting of Troyes and Brentford couldn't prepare him for this.",
      "That he has hit the ground running is a positive sign. It is exactly what Fernandes did in the second half of the 2019/20 season, when he immediately looked like he belonged and took responsibility in a United shirt.",
      "Mbeumo's return of eight goals and an assist in 18 appearances for United is good, but just as encouraging is who he has made an impact against. There have now been goals against Liverpool, Tottenham and City. He is proving key in the biggest games and after his performance at the weekend, he will fancy a crack at Arsenal on Sunday.",
      "He has a long way to go to match the contribution Fernandes has made at United, but this has been an excellent start. For too long, United managers have had to rely solely on Fernandes as the big-game hunter. He has always been the player you turn to when the team needs a spark.",
      "Now, Mbeumo is showing evidence that he can be there as well. It was no surprise that the two of them teamed up to create the first goal against Pep Guardiola's side at the weekend.",
      "Recruitment has long been a major issue at United, but Mbeumo is shaping up to be a success story.",

      "Manchester United centre-back Lisandro Martinez(Image: Carl Recine/Getty Images)",
      "Incredibly, after one of the most impressive Manchester United performances in some time, the main sub-plot coming out of the Manchester derby is a rift between Paul Scholes, Nicky Butt and Lisandro Martinez. In the build-up to the derby, the former United midfielders gave a scathing critique of the Argentine on their podcast - The Good, The Bad and The Football.",
      "\"Martinez against [Erling] Haaland,\" Scholes said before wincing. Butt responded: “Haaland would pick Martinez up and run with him. You know when you see a dad at school running down the road with a little toddler?” The legendary midfielder added: “He’d score, then throw him in the net.”",
      "It was an outburst which raised eyebrows among the United fanbase as their comments went beyond normal punditry criticism, towards, at best, immature teasing of a professional footballer. Fittingly, Martinez started and impressed at Old Trafford on Saturday as he helped keep the Norwegian quiet, including producing a timely block to stop the striker.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FACEBOOK PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "With a 2-0 victory under their belt, it seemed the matter had been put to rest until the Argentine spoke in the mixed zone afterwards. \"Honestly, he [Scholes] can say whatever he wants. I told him already, if he wants to say something to me, he can come to wherever he wants.\"",
      "Unsurprisingly, Scholes was quick to respond. \"Someone's had a good game, was really happy for you... Tea, no sugar please Lisandro Martinez.\" For now, that is where the back and forth ends but the whole saga has threatened to overshadow what was a brilliant victory in Michael Carrick's return fixture.",
      "Martinez had every right to respond to Scholes after the victory over City and that result obviously empowered him to speak out. Scholes is also no stranger to ruffling a few feathers with his takes.",
      "Back in December, he branded Ruben Amorim's handling of Kobbie Mainoo as 'b*******' while Butt and Scholes agreed they would advise him to leave United if he to asked their opinion. Pundits should never be mere mouthpieces for the clubs they used to play for.",
      "But some pundits and ex United players are not holding back. Gary Neville was cited by Amorim over claims his criticism was influencing the club's decision makers while Roy Keane was scathing about the appointment of Jonny Evans to the backroom staff and took a pot-shot at Carrick's wife on the Stick to Football podcast after a social media spat during the midfielder's playing days.",
      "In an age where outrage sells, especially on social media, it is unsurprising to see punditry comments become a bit clos to the bone. Martinez and other United players should also be encouraged to respond to it, if they see fit.",
      "But, Martinez and his teammates are only in their right to respond if they are happy to hold their hands up when things are not going as well. It is telling when United win a match, social media is awash with posts from the squad celebrating and thanking the fans.",
      "Yet, when they lose, apologies are few and far between. Perhaps this is partly down to PRs advising their clients to keep quiet but it does come across as disingenuous to seemingly only comment after a win.",
      "Now that both men have had their say, it is time for a line to be drawn underneath this saga and for Martinez to continue doing his talking on the pitch. If he continues to perform well, the critics will have little reason to speak out.",

      "Amorim's decision to neglect one of the best young midfielders in English football felt bizarre and criminal in equal measure. And in the end it became self defeating. Because he no longer has a job at Old Trafford, while Mainoo does.",
      "His treatment of Mainoo left him so disillusioned he wanted to leave United. His hometown club. The one he grew up supporting. The one which scouted him at the age of six, and signed him at the age of seven.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FACEBOOK PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "Mainoo had spent the last few weeks speaking to Napoli. He had seen how former team-mate Scott McTominay had taken his game to new levels with the Italian champions. And he was keen to do the same for himself, under the guidance of Antonio Conte.",
      "He knew Amorim was ruining his season - not to mention his chances of being named in Thomas Tuchel's England squad for this summer's World Cup. But Napoli can forget about signing Mainoo now because Mainoo has forgotten about making a move to the Amalfi coast. Home is where his heart is again.",
      "Mainoo reminded everyone what a top class player he is during United's thumping of Manchester City at Old Trafford. The one who held United together at times in his breakthrough season. The one who started for England in the final of Euro 2024.",
      "Mainoo was the epitome of composure and class in a high-octane game. He was the outstanding midfielder on the pitch, one which also included Ballon d'Or winner Rodri. To such an extent that Rodri was insignificant from start to finish. All of this was achieved in a game which was his first league start of the season.",
      "It's understood Michael Carrick spoke to Mainoo after being appointed interim manager. He told him he would be part of his plans between now and the end of the season. He told him to focus on re-establishing himself in the team. He told him to prove Amorim wrong. And Mainoo has done.",
      "Amorim's stubbornness cost Mainoo half a season of football. While it might be too late for him to impress Tuchel enough to take him to North America. But at a time when United are crying out for some genuine quality in midfield, but seem unwilling to send the money to get it, the fallen giants will feel like a new signing has arrived shown up again.",
      "Mainoo will not turn 21 until April, and has a long career ahead of him. And United should make sure the bulk of it is with them - whoever happens to be the manager.",

      "Lammens made an impressive debut against Sunderland.(Image: Getty Images)",
      "Senne Lammens wore a polo shirt and a navy sweatshirt when he visited Old Trafford after signing for Manchester United. The young goalkeeper looked as though he could be joining United to work in their HR department.",
      "The same observation was made when Lammens reported for international duty with Belgium last week - the 23-year-old was dressed in a beige collared jacket, a khaki t-shirt and chinos.",
      "\"By accident, I saw an article saying he was wearing something boring when he reported for international duty and fans saying they hoped he stays like this,\" laughed Hayk Milkon, one of Lammens' former coaches.",
      "\"This 'boringness' is just the way Senne is, he's really calm and no excesses. He focuses on what he needs to focus on and is open with the people around him. He keeps his feet on the ground.\"",
      "If Lammens looks like someone who could work in an office, every workplace would love to have him in their five-a-side team. United believe they have signed a young goalkeeper with huge potential, and fans who were present at Old Trafford against Sunderland left the stadium buzzing about his debut.",
      "The quirk is that Lammens appears to be a different person when he wears his goalkeeper kit. He made a supremely confident United debut, aggressively commanded his area and kept a clean sheet.",
      "Milkon coached Lammens during their time together at Club Brugge. Milkon is now the youngest manager in the Belgian top-flight and Lammens plays for the biggest club in England.",
      "\"It was Senne with his headphones on. He would go into the gym to do his recovery or some extra top-ups. Or he would just go to relax by playing basketball - he loved to play basketball.\"",
      "Lammens celebrates against Sunderland. (Image: 2025 Ben Roberts - Danehouse)",
      "Milkon coached in different roles at Club Brugge. He was the assistant of Club NXT (their reserve team), served as their interim manager, was in charge of the Under-18s and eventually became a first-team coach.",
      "His time at Club Brugge coincided with Lammens progressing from the academy to their first team, so he is uniquely positioned to provide insight into United's new goalkeeper signing.",
      "Lammens joined Club Brugge's academy when he was 12. \"He was a guy with huge potential,\" said Milkon. \"As I learned from colleagues who had worked with him when he was much younger, I heard there was a moment that clicked in his head when he became super professional.",
      "\"He was one of the guys during Covid - when the players were not able to train - who was doing a lot at home, he was really going far with this to be the best in these types of areas.",
      "\"Then he continued like this when he joined the first team to train with them. He always wanted to improve. We also had something in place to look at the parameters on which goalkeepers are judged.",
      "\"You see the potential of the goalkeeper based on what they do in games; so their positioning, their decision-making and so on, and Senne was always quite high in these areas.",
      "\"The only bad luck that he had was that the first-team goalkeeper was Simon Mignolet. He's an amazing goalkeeper, so it was difficult for Senne to stay over there in the role of No.2.",
      "\"That would have also blocked his growth, so it was good for him in the end to make the step to go to Antwerp and he did a tremendous job there. It was amazing to see how fast he adapted.\"",
      "Milkon pictured during his stint with Club Brugge (he now manages F.C.V. Dender).(Image: )",
      "Milkon continued: \"I think for us at Club Brugge, it was very clear to everyone that Senne was a top goalkeeper. He would have been the perfect fit for Club Brugge to be the No.1.",
      "\"That was not possible because Mignolet was there. But the parameters that we used to judge his performances indicated he was ticking so many boxes already, and he was consistently doing it.",
      "\"There weren't ups and downs with his performances. He was consistently really high and when you compare this to the top goalkeepers, you have a benchmark to say 'Ok, what potential does this guy have?'",
      "\"He had some chances with the first team at Club Brugge and made a mistake, or maybe two, but in the end it was very clear to everyone that he was a top goalkeeper.",
      "\"It was impossible to try to extend his contract because, again, you have Mignolet, and you cannot block a guy like this. You know he has to go out, he has to play, and he will improve even more.\"",
      "When asked about Lammens' strengths, he said: \"I would say that his decision-making was very good. He is very calm, he sees the solutions on the pitch, he has a quick reaction time and understands the balance between risk and reward, and which decisions are the right ones to make.",
      "\"His clean passing is great, his footwork was really good, and he's just an amazing goalkeeper with the shot-stopping. He made some incredible saves back then already. He's quite a complete goalkeeper.",
      "\"But making the right decisions at a very young age, being very mature with this, was really impressive. And the fact that he is good with both feet is another big strength.",
      "\"For me, Senne is a very calm guy and has all the qualities to be a top professional. That was my impression when I first met him when he was younger and he never changed.\"",
      "A baby-faced Lammens playing for Club Brugge in 2021. (Image: 2021 BSR Agency)",
      "Lammens joined Royal Antwerp on a free transfer in the summer of 2023. He was handed his debut a few months later and served as an understudy that season, but earned first-choice status for 2024/2025.",
      "His performances drew attention from the Belgian media. Lammens saved four penalties across a successful first full campaign and received a call-up to Belgium's senior squad in March.",
      "Milkon said: \"I was not surprised when I saw Manchester United had come calling. And to record his first clean sheet, I was really happy for him. Senne is a potential No.1 for the Red Devils - the Belgium national team.",
      "\"He got his chance, he took it, and we're all really proud of him, but we knew it would happen. I believe he has all the capabilities to become the best in the world, so I wish him all the best. I'm sure he will have a very good career in England, and Manchester United should return to the big club they used to be.",
      "\"He will have a positive impact on that, for sure, and hopefully he will be Belgium's first-choice goalkeeper soon. I believe he has the potential, the skillset and the personality to do that.",
      "\"For me, it was just having a tiny little part in having an influence on him at Brugge, but it was the most positive memories of our relationship that we had during this spell.",
      "\"I'm very proud that he is reaching these high levels and not surprised. I believe he will be successful because he is a guy who will not change his focus or start to do something different. He is calm, that's his personality and character, and he wants to succeed. He is hungry and will keep working to be his best.",
      "\"He is so calm, and you have to be patient in football. You cannot worry too much and want things too early, but finding the balance between not being impatient and, at the same time, pushing and demanding what you deserve in a good way, means everything will sort itself out.\"",
      "Lammens in action for Royal Antwerp in 2024. (Image: Photonews 2024)",
      "United staff who have worked with Lammens at Carrington have echoed Milkon's sentiments. He has been described as \"really mature for his age\" and is said to have taken the move in his stride.",
      "Lammens is understood to have impressed coaches during training sessions and a United source said that lots of people have been speaking positively about him. He has already relocated from the luxury hotel where he was initially staying and into a house.",
      "It's no surprise that Lammens likes to play basketball at 6ft 3in, but he is a keen golfer, which is common ground with the likes of Tom Heaton, Luke Shaw, Mason Mount and Harry Maguire.",
      "Matthijs de Ligt, Amad, Maguire and Shaw jogged straight to Lammens to congratulate him after full-time against Sunderland. \"Are you Schmeichel in disguise?\" was chanted at Lammens from the Stretford End.",
      "It remains to be seen whether Lammens will start against Liverpool on Sunday, but it would be a surprise to see him on the bench after delivering a strong debut before the international break.",
      "There would be nothing boring about keeping another clean sheet - this time at Anfield.",

      "A terribly dull January was enlivened slightly last week when United were said to be in talks over a loan deal for ‘a secret midfielder’ who played abroad but had Premier League experience.",
      "That international man of mystery is Loftus-Cheek.",
      "The 27-year-old has played in all the Serie A games for which he’s been available this season but mostly as a substitute in a variety of midfield roles. Which makes it handy that, according to Maurizio Sarri and Milan director Igli Tare, Loftus-Cheek is a ‘complete’ midfielder.",
      "The ex-Chelsea star earned an England recall in September – he wasn’t in Thomas Tuchel’s October or November squads – and it would be intriguing to see him back in the Premier League. Though Wilfried Ndidi, currently of Besiktas, seems to fit United’s required profile rather better.",

      "Premier League rivals Manchester United and Tottenham Hotspur are both interested in signing Borussia Dortmund midfielder Felix Nmecha, according to reports.",
      "Tottenham and United are both looking to improve their squads, though a Nmecha saga is not expected to materialise in January.",
      "Nmecha has emerged as one of the most in-demand midfielders in the Bundesliga, with Premier League clubs monitoring his situation at Borussia Dortmund ahead of the summer transfer window.",
      "Thomas Frank’s side have been busy this month, adding ex-Chelsea midfielder Conor Gallagher in a £35million deal from Atletico Madrid and selling Brennan Johnson to Crystal Palace for a similar fee.",
      "The north Londoners are languishing in 14th place in the Premier League, so Frank will hope to add one or two more players this month, with RB Leipzig forward Yan Diomande strongly linked.",
      "United, meanwhile, do not have much money to play with this month but have also been linked with Diomande, as well as Al-Hilal and Portugal midfielder Ruben Neves.",
      "Adding a new midfielder was thought to be a priority heading into the winter window; however, Ruben Amorim’s departure has changed things and, with Michael Carrick in interim charge for the rest of the 2025/26 season, it is unlikely that the Red Devils will sign anyone in January.",
      "United will certainly be busy in the summer transfer window as Sir Jim Ratcliffe and company prepare to heavily back another manager.",
      "A midfield player will surely be on the agenda, with Crystal Palace’s Adam Wharton, Brighton’s Carlos Baleba and Nottingham Forest’s Elliot Anderson all under consideration.",
      "MAN UTD TRANSFER NEWS ON F365\n* Romano reveals ‘crazy’ Tottenham, Man Utd battle for £87m star as Liverpool ‘prepare concrete bid’\n* Man Utd ‘ready to use’ flop as ‘bait’ in swap deal to land PL star as cheaper Baleba alternative\n* Five-year net spend table sees Man City leapfrog Liverpool with January splurge",
      "However, Nmecha could be a wildcard option for the Red Devils, though it is Spurs who are preparing a ‘transfer attack’, according to Bild (via Sport Witness).",
      "The report claims Spurs were able to take a ‘closer look’ at the 25-year-old as Borussia Dortmund visited the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium in the Champions League on Tuesday.",
      "Nmecha played 67 minutes as Spurs won 2-0 and is ‘unlikely to come cheap’, with a €60million (£52m) valuation mooted.",
      "Dortmund are not preparing for life without Nmecha – who is under contract until 2028 – and are unlikely to accept an offer below that fee.",
      "The former Manchester City youth player was asked about playing in the Premier League in the future before Tuesday’s match against Spurs.",
      "He said: “Whether I want to play in the Premier League or not, I’m not going to say right now. I think for me it’s simply important that we win this game [vs Spurs] and that I hopefully enjoy this special day.”",

      "Undistributed amounts from each league phase draw – £608,000 – are also allocated proportionately to these ranking payments at the end of the league phase, so the prize money for positions will be higher.",
      "There is also extra money on offer for finishing in the top eight and for coming between 9th and 16th. This is how Liverpool made a fortune despite being knocked out in the last 16 last season.",
      "3) The ‘value pillar’ (£740.6m/35%) – a combination of payments based on club coefficient rankings and the TV pool. This can be harder to accurately calculate but will naturally reward the ‘bigger’ clubs and traditional elite.",
      "Paris Saint-Germain, Bayern Munich, Real Madrid and the Premier League’s four regular European qualifiers in Manchester City, Liverpool, Chelsea and Arsenal would be the biggest winners here, with Qarabag, Pafos and Kairat due more modest sums.",

      "On Saturday evening I posted on BlueSky that I didn’t think Oliver Glasner would still be Crystal Palace manager at the end of the season.",
      "However, I am not particularly surprised that the club’s response to his outbursts has been to keep him in post. This is, after all, a club that values its principles enough to stick to them even when straying from them would have brought more success, at least in the short term, according to an article I wrote for this site back in 2016. Jesus of Montreal I didn’t realise it was that long ago.",
      "I have some sympathy for Glasner, because the timing of the decision to sell Marc Guehi (and therefore withdraw him from selection for the Sunderland game) was about as bad as it could get. At the same time, it seems hugely unlikely that he would not have been aware of the negotiations taking place, and must have expected this would happen eventually, so there’s no real excuse for being caught out by it.",
      "Glasner’s main mistake, however, is not spinning the story his way. His previous comments have suggested he wants about 20 first team-calibre players but wants to pick the same starting XI when everyone is fit. The first of those is the preserve of the biggest clubs, and while it’s a nice ambition to have, there’s a reason clubs the size of Palace tend to fall into the second group.",
      "While his squad on Saturday was, as Harry Redknapp might say, down to the bare bones, it was almost the perfect opportunity to make his case to the board: “I used the players I had available but they’re not ready for the Premier League yet, we need reserves who are”. Instead, he made no substitutions, even with his team 2-1 down with 20 minutes to play, a move that came across as petulance bordering on unprofessionalism.",
      "This is where I have sympathy for the board: by their standards they did spend significant money (approximately £50m) in the summer on fleshing out the squad, something they likely did knowing they’d receive a big fee for Eberechi Eze. For Glasner’s talk of having his heart broken, Palace did make a good start to the season, even without Eze. If the timeline we’ve been told about is correct, then Glasner informed the board he was going to leave at the end of his contract. Despite knowing this, they still broke their transfer record to sign Brennan Johnson, a player described as a perfect fit for Glasner’s system, in January. It’s not reasonable to expect a club to spend a fortune every time their manager has a fit of pique, even if there will always be the lingering suspicion that a couple of judicious signings in the summer might have avoided all of this.",
      "Where the board deserve some credit is in (at least as of 3pm on Monday) not being so fragile of ego as to sack Glasner for his insolence. I don’t expect they’re happy about what their manager has said, but it’s definitely the reaction of a grown-up to treat it for what it is, an outburst rooted in frustration and a situation that can be mediated, if not fully repaired. It’s fair to say that plenty of club directors would not have given Glasner this much leeway and you have to wonder if potential employers are having second thoughts about appointing him.",

      "I see it’s been decided that Thomas Frank doesn’t have what it takes to be Spurs manager. He can’t deliver what Spurs fans want. But Spurs fans won’t say what ‘it’ is. What do you want? To be in the top 6 every year? Champions League every year? Title race? Ok, but ahead of who? There are 7 other teams who want all that and can realistically achieve it – which of those should Spurs be displacing? Which of the midtable sides – Everton, Sunderland, Brentford, Brighton, Palace, etc – are Spurs entitled to be ahead of?",
      "The fact bears repeating: Spurs finished *17th* last year. Obviously their fans immediately spring into action when this is pointed out: ‘oh, we won a European trophy!’ Brilliant, let me know how following in West Ham’s footsteps is working out for you. ‘Oh we were concentrating on Europe, we could have finished higher in the league, we just didn’t want to.’ Yeah ok. Maybe you shouldn’t have sacked the manager who masterminded this false rubbishness in that case? And just told him, g’day, we want to finish higher in the league this year mate. Yeah, 1st would be lovely actually mate. Have a VB.",
      "Some of this year’s games have been awful and hard to watch; some of the results have been terrible. Yes. And? Welcome to being a football fan. Everyone has to deal with this. Superclubs like Real Madrid, Bayern Munich, PSG, etc feel they’re entitled to skip this part of the experience. Spurs are not these clubs. Their fans think they are long-suffering. They are not.",
      "Look at the defensive players Frank has got to work with: Paulinha has the brain of a dog; Udogie and Porro are complete disgracia; Spence acts like a child on Supernanny. Spurs fans won’t hear anything said against their centre backs, but they are objectively average: Van der Ven can run fast and Romero kicks people and complains a lot, wow. Maybe stop people from scoring occasionally? And Vicario.",
      "But Frank is getting a better tune out of his back 6/7 than anyone since the last time Spurs finished above Arsenal. They’ve conceded over 60 goals for the last 3 seasons in a row; this year they’re on course to concede 50. And aside from Arsenal, they have the best away record in the league – a sign that when they can keep games tight and put the onus on the opposition, they can be successful. It’s not hard to find signs that Frank is actually improving this team, if anyone has the patience to look. Granted, not relative to the imaginary version of Tottenham that their mad fans have in their heads; but relative to the one in the real world that, apart from the worst set of promoted sides since the competition started, was the *worst team* in the premier league last season. Pretend this wasn’t true if it makes you feel better, knock yourself out.",
      "Obviously, Spurs’ problem in translating this quiet improvement into more points and better home form is, constructing coherent attacks and scoring a lot more goals. But how does a new manager fix this? Richarlison is their best attacking player. *Richarlison*. Unless Ryan Mason CDXXVII can give Maddison new legs and find a 20 goal a year striker down the back of the sofa, where do the goals come from? Tel? Simons? I mean, we’re immediately talking the transfer market aren’t we?",
      "Unless the plan is to hire a new manager and tell them, you can’t sign any new players because actually we already have one of the best 4 squads in the country. If so, I have some bad news. But if it is time to sound the warchest klaxon, then it’s implicit that the current squad is not good enough for what is apparently desired.

      "Having last season watched Rasmus Hojlund do a similarly ineffective job up top, I do get the instinct to defend Gyokeres. Having an inept striker can be an especially grating experience – even if the rest of your team is humming and producing cohesive build-up play, you’re never far from a move breaking down via the link in the team that should add that crucial iota of potency.",
      "It’s made all the worse when they show occasional flashes of quality or produce a smart finish. “See? The ability is there, consistency is what’s missing”, we tell ourselves. But when the required quality is lacking, you can’t expect a sub-standard striker to produce those flashes more regularly. Sometimes, your expensive frontman is only able to impact games sporadically because that’s his ceiling.",
      "Rob’s argument for Gyokeres doing fine doesn’t really touch on his ability though – it seems entirely based around Arsenal sitting pretty in mid-January with him in the team. Arteta picks him for the team top of the league, and he’s an actual football manager, so if you think he’s crap, you are clearly wrong sir. But it doesn’t work that way does it? Anyone who’s watched a middling amount of Arsenal this season will tell you that he’s struggled badly.",
      "Isn’t it possible, or even probable, that Arsenal would be in an even stronger position if they’d invested in a striker who was at a level consistent with the rest of their team? 10-15 points clear with no lingering doubts over their goal threat maybe? Gyokeres really doesn’t pass the eye test – poor goal return, minimal contribution, looks laboured and out of sync when he does get involved. The frequent rush to highlight his effort and attitude has been a giveaway to be honest – it’s a classic case of damning with faint praise. Hojlund often got the same sympathetic treatment when charging after a pass down a channel only for it to bounce off his knee out of play.",
      "You can be top of the league, top of the Champions League etc., but still have some weak links Rob. And it’s hard to term Gyokeres as anything other than that up to this point. You’re rightly happy with a season that’s well on track in spite of his struggles.

      "My problem with this is the way he has set up the team; it’s just so f**king boring to watch. My belief is it’s the system not the injuries or the bedding in. I’d honestly relinquish a few places in the table in exchange for some excitement. The infinite horseshoe tactic is the worst thing I’ve seen in all the years I’ve watched them play (mid 80s – god I’m old).

Quite unprofessional, but ball boys can sometimes be a bit cheeky… However Spain pulled the same trick in the semi-final and got away with it. Noting that match officials seem utterly non-plussed to these anticss and that Pickford needs to stay focused on the game, Dean Henderson comes over to keep the towel safe personally. Unpeturbed by this the ball boys and staff continue to play capture the flag with this towel and then, Spain’s subs start going tying in on the act.",

      "Man Utd have made Niko Kovac one of their top targets to succeed Ruben Amorim and Borussia Dortmund fans ‘would welcome’ his exit, according to reports.",
      "The Red Devils sacked Amorim, who only won three of his final 11 matches, over a fortnight ago after a miserable 14 months under the Portuguese head coach.",
      "Darren Fletcher was made caretaker manager for two matches against Burnley and Brighton, before former Man Utd midfielder Michael Carrick was appointed interim boss until the end of the season.",
      "Carrick could not have wished for a better start with a comprehensive 2-0 win over arch-rivals Man City on Saturday, thanks to goals from Bryan Mbeumo and Patrick Dorgu.",
      "However, the plan is still to appoint a permanent successor to Amorim in the summer with a number of managers linked to the position.",
      "With a number of top managers set to leave their positions in the summer and a World Cup around the corner, Man Utd thought it would be prudent to wait until the the summer to make a decision on a permanent appointment.",
      "READ: Lisandro Martinez given eight-word advice by old man shouting at clouds",
      "Our friends at TEAMtalk broke the news that Dortmund boss Kovac is ‘one of the names’ on the Man Utd shortlist to succeed Amorim in the summer.",
      "And now Spanish publication Fichajes insists that Man Utd ‘want’ Kovac with the story reiterating that the Bundesliga manager is on their shortlist, which has ‘generated surprise’ in Germany.",
      "Fichajes adds: ‘One of the names that has emerged in recent hours is that of Niko Kovac , the current Borussia Dortmund manager. The Croatian has been in charge of the German club for nearly a year, but his time at Signal Iduna Park hasn’t left a particularly positive impression on the fans.",
      "‘That’s precisely why his potential candidacy for Manchester United has surprised even in Germany. Kovac hasn’t managed to get the best out of a squad with talent, depth, and high aspirations. The team has shown inconsistency, a lack of decisiveness in key matches, and a style of play that hasn’t quite convinced. In fact, a significant portion of Dortmund’s fanbase would welcome his move to England.’",
      "It is understood that at Old Trafford ‘there’s a feeling that the problem can’t be solved solely with a heavy hand or a defensive structure, two of the traits associated with the Croatian manager.’",
      "And Man Utd are ‘keeping several options open’ as the Red Devils face a crucial summer decision as Jason Wilcox ‘continues to evaluate candidates for both an immediate solution and a strategic replacement in the summer’.",
      "Jadon Sancho is out of contract at the end of next season with former club Borussia Dortmund said to be keen…but only on one condition",
      "An insider has revealed the thoughts of Manchester United on Jadon Sancho, who is on loan with Aston Villa, with the final opportunity for his sale approaching.",
      "Man Utd are one of two clubs hoping to do a deal for Borussia Dortmund midfielder Jobe Bellingham in the winter transfer market, according to reports.",
      "England legend Sir Geoff Hurst has slammed the behaviour of Mark Bellingham after he complained about his son, Jobe, being substituted for Dortmund."

      "According to reports, Manchester United are ‘ready to use’ £42m flop Manuel Ugarte as ‘bait’ in a swap deal involving a Sunderland star.",
      "It is common knowledge that the Red Devils‘ top transfer priority this year is to overhaul their midfield.",
      "In the summer, Man Utd focused on revamping their attack and signing a new No.1 goalkeeper, having invested around £230m to sign Benjamin Sesko, Bryan Mbeumo, Matheus Cunha and Senne Lammens.",
      "Each of these signings, especially Mbeumo, Cunha and Lammens, have made a positive impact this season, but Michael Carrick‘s side are still sorely lacking in other departments and this is particularly the case in midfield.",
      "The Red Devils made an audacious attempt to land Brighton’s Carlos Baleba in the summer, but a deal was deemed impossible as they had limited funds after making those aforementioned signings.",
      "This means United are still crying out for a No.6 and Baleba remains an option, but they are also linked with other potential targets.",
      "READ: Martinez has made Butt look a right mug; Man Utd pundit the one who needs to ‘f***ing grow up’",
      "This includes Sunderland star Noah Sadiki, who has been a revelation since joining Regis Le Bris’ side in the summer for around £15m.",
      "Sunderland fended off competition from Leeds United to sign Sadiki, who is unlucky not to feature on our list of the best 2025/26 Premier League signings.",
      "Unfortunately for Sunderland, Sadiki’s form leaves them at risk of losing the centre-midfielder in the coming months, with it reported last month that Man Utd are prepared to ‘go all in’ for him if they decide to move away from Baleba.",
      "Sadiki is surely valued at much more than £15m currently, but a report from GiveMeSport claims Man Utd are ‘ready to use’ Ugarte as ‘bait’ in a ‘swap deal’ in an attempt to drive his price down.",
      "The report claims: ‘Ruben Amorim was willing to sanction the £42 million Uruguayan’s departure, but the Portuguese would have preferred it to be a permanent move.",
      "‘And talk inside Old Trafford is that if United do follow Amorim’s thought process and look to offload Ugarte, he could be used as swop-bait to land Sunderland’s ‘incredible’ 20-year-old midfield talent Noah Sadiki.’",
      "However, ex-Man Utd defender Mikael Silvestre has explained why he thinks his former club needs to prioritise Baleba and Crystal Palace’s Adam Wharton for their midfield rebuild.",
      "“Man United should sign a centre midfielder in January,” Silvestre told Esports Insider.",
      "“Casemiro isn’t getting any younger, and if the club are playing in Europe next season, they’ll need more depth in the middle of the park.",
      "“There are plenty of options available on the market too and I believe Adam Wharton at Crystal Palace and Carlos Baleba at Brighton would both be great additions to the squad. Former youth player James Garner is also a possibility – he’s at Everton now, but he might be tempted to return to Old Trafford if he was guaranteed minutes under Michael Carrick.",
      "“United are too light in that position at the moment. Casemiro, Kobbie Mainoo and Manuel Ugarte are good options to occupy a place in the centre midfield, but if one gets injured, you’ve got no backup options. They need a strong forth man to cover that position, especially if they’re playing in multiple competitions next year.”",
      "Man Utd have been ‘offered the chance’ to sign former Chelsea star Ruben Loftus-Cheek as they weigh up signing a midfielder, according to reports.",
      "Manchester United legend Rio Ferdinand has admitted that he has been “disappointed” by one Red Devils player who has not been good enough.",
      "Nicky Butt and Rio Ferdinand have both hit out at the Red Devils midfielder, who’s reportedly ‘agreed’ to leave in January.",
      "Man Utd are not planning on making any new signings in January as Michael Carrick will have to work with the current squad, according to reports.",
      "According to reports, Manchester United have turned to Atletico Madrid for a potential signing, while Manuel Ugarte “will leave” the Premier League giants.",
      "According to reports, a Manchester United star has reached an ‘agreement’ to leave the club this month, though this deal hinges on one condition."

But taking to social media afterwards to goad Scholes and his podcast partner Nicky Butt – who simply will not give a damn – over comments they made in the build-up was utterly self-defeating and only serves to fan the flames of an issue that new head coach Michael Carrick needs to die down as soon as possible.",

      "Three teams have been picked for more Premier League TV games than Arsenal, Liverpool and Chelsea this season. Manchester United, obviously, but also…",
      "Premier League clubs received a total of £2.83billion last season, which was comprised of six payments through the division’s ‘central revenue system’, something the Premier League says ‘ensures the most equitable distribution of funds of any major European league’.",
      "Liverpool were paid £174.9m as champions – short of Manchester City’s record £176.2m in 2022/23 – while Newcastle received just over £160m to chuck into their PSR black hole.",
      "Southampton were handed £109.2m for their efforts in finishing a distant bottom. It pays to be in the Premier League.",
      "Some of those payments are fixed. All 20 clubs automatically receive around £96.9m through an equal share distributed based on both the domestic (£29.8m in 2024/25) and international (£59.2m in 2024/25) broadcast deals – those TV rights are lucrative for a reason – as well as £7.9m each from central commercial revenue streams.",
      "The rest is variable, based on where clubs finish and how often their games are selected for broadcast.",

      "The Premier League merit payments are distributed on a sliding scale from 1st to 20th, made up of combined earnings from domestic and international broadcast deals.",
      "For the 2024/25 season, the difference in prize money was around £2.7m per position. Southampton were given as much for finishing bottom, all the way up to champions Liverpool receiving £53.1m. It basically helped pay for 97.4% of Giorgi Mamardashvili and Jeremie Frimpong.",
      "That can be expected to fluctuate with inflation and other factors – it was around £2.8m per position in 2023/24 – but it offers a rough guide as to what clubs should expect to earn this season.",

Arsenal had 29 matches and were paid £24.2m, while Manchester United (28 games for £23.4m), Aston Villa (27 games for £22.6m) and Chelsea (26 games for £21.8m) were televised frequently and rewarded handsomely.",
      "Ipswich were shown on the fewest occasions and received £8.9m in facility fees for their 10 live televised UK fixtures.",
      "This can lead to discrepancies in terms of those variable payments. Manchester United’s prize money after finishing 15th last season was £136.2m, more than the four clubs immediately above them – West Ham (£130.9m in 14th), Everton (£131.8m in 13th), Crystal Palace (£136.1m in 12th) and Fulham (£135.5m in 11th) – as Ruben Amorim’s side were picked for far more live TV games.",
      "Spurs were another massive outlier, earning more in 17th (£127.8m) than Wolves did in 16th (£123.1m) in part because they had nine more games picked for live UK broadcast.",

      "Unai Emery has foolishly been named Premier League Manager of the Month and then conducted a weird interview hinting at issues behind the Aston Villa scenes.",
      "That might not sound like a potent combination for a prompt sacking but in this particular season it is at least an inadvisable path to go down.",
      "Emery has followed an entirely doomed succession line of Premier League Manager of the Month award winners in 2025/26: Enzo Maresca, Ruben Amorim, Oliver Glasner and Arne Slot. And the two winners at the end of 2024/25 were Vitor Pereira and Nuno Espirito Santo.",
      "In the cases of Maresca, Amorim and the entirely miserable Glasner especially they were crowned against a backdrop of hierarchical and boardroom issues which ultimately helped trigger their departures.",
      "So Emery saying Villa “are not contenders to be in the top five” and venting about “other teams with more potential than us” in a nod to Spurs hijacking their move for Conor Gallagher and Donyell Malen being sold before a replacement was secured, did not sit right with many.",
      "Jamie Redknapp called it “one of the oddest interviews I have ever seen”. Ashley Young thought it was “weird”. Stuart Pearce wondered “whether the frustration going forward will be too much for him that he can’t take this team any further”. Brooklyn Beckham was asked for comment but he’s got a lot going on.",
      "The likelihood of Emery actually leaving this season is infinitesimal; the bloke just wears his heart on his sleeve and was understandably slightly rattled by having to play David Moyes’ Everton.",
      "But in the unlikely event he does leave a post in which he holds an unimaginable amount of power and leeway, Emery would not be the first Premier League Manager of the Month to resign or be sacked in the same season.",
      "He wouldn’t even be the first at Villa Park to be hit by the curse…",
      "",
      "Club: Tottenham\nNamed Manager of the Month: November 2020\nPosition when MOTM: 1st\nSacked: April 2021\nPosition when sacked: 7th",
      "The Mourinho boom and bust cycle was in full flow by November 2020 when Spurs beat Brighton, West Brom and Manchester City, rounding the month off with a draw at Chelsea to consolidate their place atop the Premier League a year after his appointment.",
      "That form soon turned and by the time Mourinho was sacked in April, Spurs were barely clinging to a qualification spot for the same Europa League that Dinamo Zagreb dumped them out of despite their coach being in prison at the time.",
      "Spurs tried to hit Mourinho where it hurts, cutting ties six days before the Carabao Cup final and preferring Ryan Mason to lead them out against Manchester City. But they underestimated the Portuguese, who just counts the trophy among his collection anyway.",
      "",
      "Club: West Brom\nNamed Manager of the Month: September 2010\nPosition when MOTM: 6th\nSacked: February 2011\nPosition when sacked: 17th",
      "“Our poor sequence of results stretches back more than three months,” explained West Brom chairman Jeremy Peace, mindful of what came shortly before that.",
      "The newly promoted Baggies felt compelled to act after winning three of 16 Premier League games and slipping into a relegation battle that seemed to be comfortably in the rear-view mirror by September. A home draw with Tottenham, derby spoils in a 3-1 win over Birmingham and a dramatic 3-2 victory at Arsenal, combined with beating Manchester City in the League Cup, had helped dampen the disappointment of a six-goal opening-day thrashing at the hands of Chelsea.",
      "As high as sixth at one stage, West Brom subsequently crashed towards the trap door and only the safety net of Roy Hodgson could rescue them and indeed any of us. But especially and always Crystal Palace.",
      "",
      "Club: Hull City\nNamed Manager of the Month: August 2016\nPosition when MOTM: 5th\nSacked: January 2017\nPosition when sacked: 20th",
      "Few neutral, critics and even fans gave Hull City a tiger’s chance in the ocean of surviving as a Premier League team in their most recent top-flight season. Promotion had been secured through the play-offs but Steve Bruce left less than a month before the campaign began, the first team contained 13 senior players at one point and a protracted takeover looked no closer to being completed.",
      "There seemed to be no hope, although the gallows humour among those who remained was strong.",
      "Against all odds, reigning Premier League champions Leicester were vanquished on the opening day and Swansea fell to Hull too. Manchester United only escaped from the KC Stadium with a win at the end of the month through Marcus Rashford’s stoppage-time strike as Phelan orchestrated an excellent start in his unfamiliar role of being anything other than Manchester United assistant.",
      "But one league win in 18 finally forced Hull into action, perhaps a little too late for Marco Silva to get to know the Premier League. By the time they had lost 6-1 to Bournemouth in October the good Phelan had already long worn off.",
      "",
      "Club: Aston Villa\nNamed Manager of the Month: September 2001\nPosition when MOTM: 4th\nResigned: January 2002\nPosition when resigned: 7th",
      "An unbeaten start to the 2001/02 campaign had the minds of Aston Villa supporters wandering once more. Title challenges had come and swiftly gone under John Gregory, while Ron Atkinson could not quite keep Manchester United’s pace in the inaugural Premier League season.",
      "September 2001 was particularly flattering as Liverpool, Southampton and Blackburn were swept aside, sandwiching a goalless draw with Sunderland. A Champions League tilt at least looked possible. But from November 3 to New Year’s Day they beat only Ipswich in 11 games and the damage was done when they surrendered a two-goal FA Cup third-round lead over United.",
      "Three days after beating Derby and Charlton in consecutive fixtures, Gregory resigned in quite hilarious circumstances due to fan disgruntlement and issues behind the scenes with chairman Doug Ellis.",
      "",
      "Club: Manchester United\nNamed Manager of the Month: October 2025\nPosition when MOTM: 8th\nSacked: January 2026\nPosition when sacked: 6th",
      "In only four of his months as Manchester United manager did Amorim win more than a single Premier League game. And to be fair, the effort it took to muster two victories in December of 2024 and 2025, as well as January 2025, made his only October in charge look generational.",
      "It all seemed to click when Sunderland and Brighton were both sent packing from Old Trafford, sandwiching a ransacking of Anfield in a month which mercifully included no participation in the cups and thus no opportunity for Manchester United to embarrass themselves.",
      "That was probably the peak of the entire experiment. Amorim won just three of his next 11 games, but most pertinently challenged the authority of the great Jason Wilcox, to fall on his sword within a couple of months.",
      "",
      "Club: Tottenham\nNamed Manager of the Month: August 2021\nPosition when MOTM: 1st\nSacked: November 2021\nPosition when sacked: 9th",
      "Only seven coaches in Premier League history have been named Manager of the Month more often than Nuno, who has more such awards than Sir Bobby Robson, Carlo Ancelotti, Claudio Ranieri, Unai Emery, Mauricio Pochettino and Mourinho.",
      "How so very Spurs, by the way, to deliver consecutive Manager of the Month sackings.",
      "Never a particularly natural fit in north London as a mid-table manager promoted beyond his station, Nuno started with three straight 1-0 wins over Manchester City, Wolves and Watford while navigating a Harry Kane transfer saga to send Spurs top.",
      "But it was all a facade: Spurs lost five of their next seven and Nuno’s fate was sealed by defeat in El Sackico.",
      "",
      "Club: Sheffield Wednesday\nNamed Manager of the Month: January 2000\nPosition when MOTM: 19th\nSacked: March 2000\nPosition when sacked: 19th",
      "Sheffield Wednesday resisted the temptation to simply cite the greatest lyricist of our times when parting ways with Wilson in March 2000.",
      "“We’ve got stars directing our fate, and we’re praying it’s not too late, ’cause we know we’re falling from grace” would have been a fitting way to say goodbye to the millennium’s first Premier League Manager of the Month.",
      "A draw with Arsenal and victories over Bradford and Tottenham offered a glimmer of survival hope at Hillsborough in January. What a month, huh? But of course, captain, it’s Wednesday – they won one of their next seven before Wilson was sacked and Peter Shreeves came in to steer the ship into the First Division.",
      "Wilson never managed in the Premier League again. It didn’t look particularly promising when David Blunkett led four Sheffield MPs in demanding Wednesday take action in mid-January as “this sort of situation would probably have been addressed back in November at most other Premiership clubs”.",
      "",
      "Club: Reading\nNamed Manager of the Month: January 2013\nPosition when MOTM: 17th\nSacked: March 2013\nPosition when sacked: 19th",
      "What was the quickest case of the curse striking came in 2013, when McDermott started February as Premier League Manager of the Month and barely made it to mid-March before being rendered unemployed.",
      "Reading went on two separate runs of seven consecutive league defeats that season but January brought brief and beautiful respite with wins over West Brom and Newcastle, as well as a comeback draw with European champions Chelsea. Three more points against Sunderland on February 2 were the last McDermott would collect in his first stint as manager at the Madejski, with defeats to Stoke, Wigan, Everton and Aston Villa plunging them back into the sort of danger even the Nigel Adkins diet could not salvage.",
      "A similar fate befell Adam Le Fondre. The striker was named Player of the Month for January in a Royal double after scoring five times in four games, yet he had to wait until May for his next goal. Le Fondre still set the benchmark that season.",
      "",
      "Club: Chelsea\nNamed Manager of the Month: November 2025\nPosition when MOTM: 5th\nSacked: January 2026\nPosition when sacked: 5th",
      "Maresca wasted almost precisely no time in starting the ball rolling towards his Chelsea demise after winning the Manager of the Month award.",
      "It was one day after being crowned for a month in which the Blues beat Spurs, Wolves and Burnley without conceding before underlining their title credentials with an impressive draw against Arsenal, that Maresca cryptically lamented his “worst 48 hours” in charge.",
      "He probably experienced even tougher times in the intervening period, winning only two of his final nine matches and having to deal with more medical professionals telling him Reece James and Cole Palmer will spontaneously combust if he keeps picking them.",
      "What Maresca clearly didn’t understand is that in English, “manage”, if you split the two words, it’s “man”, “age” – you’re ageing men. Or teenaged South American forwards.",
      "January is an odd window and these five possible deals that could be done before the deadline feel more particularly peculiar…",
      "Mikel Arteta would be ‘absolutely bonkers’ to make one selection call against Manchester United, while a ‘theory’ has emerged that Pep Guardiola will resign.",
      "We know Oliver Glasner will leave Crystal Palace at the end of the season (or sooner) but who is set to take over?",
      "It is starting to become clear why some ‘people seem to think Saka don’t pass to Gyokeres’. One unfancied Arsenal star did nothing to convince Mikel Arteta.",
      "Dominik Szoboszlai keeps making very silly decisions. And now he looks like he has been pulled into the Liverpool sludge.",
      "We’re giving Mikel Arteta a pass here because he is walking the walk but Liam Rosenior and David Brentford love the LinkedIn grift."

      "Diogo Dalot's challenge on Jeremy Doku in Manchester derby was worthy of a red card according to PGMOL chief Howard Webb; But VAR was right not to intervene in 10th-minute incident that saw the Man Utd defender only shown a yellow",
      "Tuesday 20 January 2026 15:48, UK",
      "PGMOL chief Howard Webb is unconvinced that Diogo Dalot’s challenge on Jeremy Doku in Man Utd’s 2-0 win over Man City was worthy of a red card - but is convinced that VAR was right not to intervene.",
      "Dalot escaped a red card for a 10th-minute tackle on Doku, which ex-Premier League referee Mike Dean believed was \"100 per cent\" a sending off.",
      "The Man Utd defender was only shown a yellow card by referee Anthony Taylor, with VAR Craig Pawson backing the on-field decision.",
      "Analysing the decision on Mic'd Up, Webb said: \"Is there excessive force? Some will say, yes. I'm not quite there, but I can see that there could be.",
      "\"It's a subjective judgment…but I'm absolutely aligned that once that decision is taken on the field, we leave it as referee's call and we don't intervene with the VAR.\"",
      "He added: \"I think it's one where the referee's call should stand on the field. That's what we've said we'll do where there's a mix of considerations.",
      "\"I think there is a mix, and therefore in this situation, it was right to leave it as the referee's call.",
      "\"If a red had been given, I would have expected the red card to stand as well, in the same way.\"",
      "Man City boss Pep Guardiola felt Dalot should have been sent off after an early foul on Jeremy Doku.",
      "But VAR Pawson stood by Taylor's on-field decision, believing the contact was \"glancing and not with force\".",
      "Webb said: \"At full speed, when you play it in real time, you can see there's not a great deal of speed in the action, not a lot of intensity.",
      "\"We were heavily criticised a few years ago for using slow motion and freeze frames because people said, this is not reality. It's not how the game is played. When you slow it down, it can look a lot worse - and it does. When you freeze frame it, you can make a lot of situations look like red card offences.",
      "\"So it's difficult for me to hear people make a judgment on this just by analysing freeze frame and slow motion, coming to the consideration that it's red on that basis.",
      "\"Yes, it could be red, but you have to think about the need to look at it at full speed. We've done that for some time now. We thought it was a fair criticism some time ago when people said, 'Stop using slow-mos as the main way of analysing these situations'. And we've listened, and we agree. And we play it at full speed. Then we slow it down a little bit to see the exact point of contact to factor that in as well.",
      "\"But without speed and force and intensity, it's unlikely to be a red card.\"",
      "Speaking at half-time at Old Trafford, Keane said: \"Doku definitely helps him [by not staying down]. I'm no expert on red cards, but I think it's a red.\"",
      "Richards said: \"He [Dalot] is on top of his knee. That is as clear a red card as you are going to see. What more do you want?!\"",
      "Ex-Premier League referee Dermot Gallagher speaking on Ref Watch:",
      "\"I thought it was a red card.",
      "\"He's gone in high and with a straight leg. He's hit him with his studs on the knee. The ball is not there, it's gone, so for me, it's a red card but for others, it is not.\"",
      "Former Cardiff and England striker Jay Bothroyd agreed with Gallafger on Ref Watch:",
      "\"I can't believe Dalot has tried to appeal the yellow card. It's a terrible challenge.",
      "\"The priority for the referees is player safety. When you see challenges like that, Doku could have ended up really hurt.",
      "\"To me, it wasn't a glancing blow. His studs are up and it is above the ankle. I don't understand how it is not a red card.",
      "\"It's a terrible decision. That's going to be one of the worst decisions of the season.\"",
      "On Mic'd Up, the full transcript between referee Taylor, VAR Pawson and assistant VAR, Adrian Holmes, was released and showed how the officials concluded staying with Taylor's on-field yellow card decision...",
      "Ref: \"I'm going yellow card, it's a glance.\"",
      "VAR: \"Yeah, he does, he's glancing contact on the knee. There's no force, but there is glancing contact. He's tried to play the ball, and he catches it with glancing contact.

      "Tuesday 20 January 2026 07:09, UK",
      "Jamie Carragher has outlined his four-man shortlist to be the next Manchester United head coach, suggesting that their next permanent boss must be a candidate with the right \"energy\" and \"drive\" to lead the club forward.",
      "United parted ways with Ruben Amorim earlier this month after a disastrous 14-month reign at the club and have since appointed Michael Carrick as head coach until the end of the season.",
      "Carrick secured an impressive 2-0 win against rivals Manchester City in his first game at the helm, but Carragher has insisted Old Trafford needs a \"special\" leader.",
      "Here are the options and what Carragher had to say...",
      "Current role: England manager",
      "What Carragher said: \"He's been in the Premier League before. He's obviously a top manager. The thing I like about him is I still think he's got that energy and drive and spikiness about him.",
      "\"He's gone into the England squad, and he's ruffled feathers with some of the biggest players there. Now I'm not saying that has to happen in every job he's in, but there's something about him.",
      "\"He just feels like he would go to war for your club, and he'd be fighting against the other clubs, and he'd have something about him.\"",
      "Current role: Paris Saint-Germain",
      "What Carragher said: \"You would absolutely have him all day. Now we see him as the best manager in Europe. He didn't have a good time at Celta Vigo, he didn't have a good time at Roma, but Barcelona still appointed him.\"",
      "Current role: Newcastle United",
      "What Carragher said: \"I'm a huge fan of Eddie Howe. The type of football when Newcastle are at their best is high energy going forward, but the real thing I like is that you have to be able to handle the pressures of Manchester United.",
      "\"When you're in Newcastle and you live in that city, it's constant and he handles it brilliantly. Where I think he could also help is that Manchester United have a problem with young players - a lot of them don't go on to fulfil their potential - but I think Eddie Howe is a great coach.\"",
      "Current role: Germany",
      "What Carragher said: \"I don't know everything about him but I do look at a coach with a big reputation, with a lot to prove in some ways.\"",
      "What Carragher said: \"I'm crossing out Michael Carrick. I go back to this question - do I believe this guy can win the league? I have to believe he can. I don't believe Man Utd will win the league with Carrick, or Chelsea will with Liam Rosenior. I'm not trying to be disrespectful, but you have to be special. I might be proven wrong.\"",
      "Carragher also highlighted why other candidates, such as Xabi Alonso, Diego Simeone and Oliver Glasner, aren't suitable for the role.",
      "\"Jurgen Klopp will not be managing Manchester United. That is out. Xabi Alonso - he cannot do that. He can't, his affiliation with Liverpool. That can't happen.",
      "\"Carlo Ancelotti, for me, wouldn't have the energy or drive to get Man Utd back. Zinedine Zidane is a younger version of [Carlo] Ancelotti, but maybe I am wrong. Enzo Maresca is a no, but he is a really good coach.",
      "\"Xavi is one, at Barcelona, he won the league but enough experience for Manchester United? He only has a couple of years of experience as a manager.",
      "\"Roberto Martinez, if he does a brilliant job at Portugal, there is no doubt that Roberto is ready. The one thing he has not done in his career is manage an elite football club.",
      "\"He'd have to do something really special. Mauricio Pochettino is the same as Ancelotti. Chelsea went with Enzo Maresca as they wanted a young and energetic coach.",
      "Oliver Glasner, straight away, I'd say no because of the system. Andoni Iraola has done a brilliant job and is linked with top jobs but Bournemouth to Man Utd is a big jump.",
      "\"This is the same for Marco Silva. I think the next step for them would be Tottenham. It feels more Tottenham-like for them. Roberto De Zerbi is a brilliant coach but he is liable to go to war with the owners within six weeks.",
      "\"Diego Simeone is an interesting one. I was speaking to Gary Neville about United's DNA. It is interesting that Roy [Keane] and Gary have both mentioned Simeone at different points.",
      "\"That goes away from what a club's DNA is because he is a defensive coach. You can't ask a manager to change.\"",

      "Sunday 18 January 2026 14:38, UK",
      "Lisandro Martinez has hit back at Paul Scholes and invited him to his house for talks after the former Man Utd midfielder criticised the defender ahead of the Manchester derby.",
      "Speaking on The Good, The Bad & The Football podcast ahead of Saturday's game, which United went on to win 2-0, Scholes and his former United team-mate Nicky Butt made fun of Martinez's 5ft 7in size.",
      "Butt joked Man City striker Erling Haaland, who stands at 6ft 4in, \"would pick Martinez up and run with him\" like a \"dad after school running down the road with a little toddler\" before Scholes laughed and said that \"he'd score then throw him in the net\".",
      "After shutting out Haaland as United kept a clean sheet against their rivals, Martinez was asked about Scholes' comments and said: \"Honestly, he can say whatever he wants. I told him already, if he wants to say something to me, he can come to me wherever he wants. To my house, wherever. I don't care.",
      "\"I think, for me, I respect the relations when they want to help the club because everyone can talk on the television. But when you see [them] here face-to-face, no one says anything in your face.",

      "Asked if such comments give him extra motivation, Martinez said: \"No, no, nothing. It doesn't give me anything. My motivation is my family. That's it.\"",
      "Scholes, having seen the interview from Martinez, posted on Instagram on Sunday: \"Someone's had a good game, was really happy for you. Tea, no sugar please…@lisandromartinezzz.\"",

      "Asked if much had changed since Carrick took over on Wednesday, Martinez said: \"So different, so different. Different mentality, different guy.",
      "\"He knows what it really means, this club. He sent us that message that he played here for a long, long time. He won everything.",
      "\"He's a big legend. He wants to help the club and I think we were in a tough situation and today was the best moment to change that.\"",
      "Martinez said \"the team today was different\", pointedly adding: \"When you have a coach like Michael Carrick, who really knows, who really can share with you the energy of the club and what it means, it's so different.\"",
      "The 28-year-old highlighted the new head coach's quiet confidence and the relentless backing from supporters.",
      "\"I feel amazing,\" Martinez said. \"I think we deserve to win this game.",
      "\"We were better on the pitch and I think we gave everything today. And when you give everything and you see the result, it's an amazing feeling and I'm so happy today.",
      "\"It's about the connection [with the fans], it's about how we represent them on the pitch. If they see us fighting like today, they will be with us.",

      "Tuesday 20 January 2026 01:14, UK",
      "Paul Scholes and Nicky Butt have continued their war of words with Manchester United's Lisandro Martinez, with Butt telling the Argentine to \"grow up\" over his response to criticism.",

      "\"I think when someone gets so upset about something in the media or a podcast…to come out and say, 'Come over to my house', f****** grow up.",
      "\"Literally, if you're going to get so emotional about someone saying something about you, you shouldn't be at a big football club because you'll get that for the rest of your career at Man United.",
      "\"I got so much crap when I played at United and Newcastle, but the next week you get plaudits and clapped at. There's no personal issue with us and Martinez, none.\"",
      "Scholes praised Martinez's display but said he still has some doubts about the 28-year-old.",
      "\"It fuels people,\" he said of criticism. \"I think we have to take a bit of the credit for Martinez's performance on Saturday!\"",
      "But he then warned: \"He's had one brilliant game, but when you start talking and shouting your mouth off, this game has a habit of coming and biting you back on the a***.",
      "\"I haven't changed my opinion yet. I'm still not sure you can win a league with him. He's got to do it over a period of time. What he did on Saturday, brilliant, but you've got to do it over a period of time.\"",
      "Butt said Martinez's reaction to their comments raised questions about his mentality.",
      "Butt pointed to the experience that he and the rest of United's 'Class of 92' had when Alan Hansen famously said on Match of the Day \"you can't win anything with kids\". A teenager at the time, Butt said that taught him to deal with criticism.",
      "\"I was 18, not 26 or 27,\" he said. \"I didn't want to go out of the house for weeks, but you man up and go and prove people wrong.\"",

      "With Bruno Fernandes the first man to create so many big chances against Pep Guardiola's Man City, Adam Bate looks at why Man Utd's playmaker needs to be in his best position. Also in The Debrief: Florentino's tackling and Newcastle's predictability",
      "Monday 19 January 2026 09:25, UK",
      "",
      "Manchester United's thrilling performance in their derby win over Manchester City on Saturday has naturally sparked talk of them being back, a restoration of sorts after Ruben Amorim's exit. That remains to be seen but for Bruno Fernandes it seems clearer.",
      "Back in his best position, restored to that No 10 role, he produced some performance at Old Trafford. Having been denied a goal and an assist by the offside flag in the first half, he eventually set up the opener - and made history against Pep Guardiola's City.",
      "In his decade in charge, no player had ever created four big chances in a Premier League game against them. In fact, Fernandes is the only player to do it against any team this season. And he has done it twice, having also achieved it in beating Wolves last month.",
      "Fernandes is responsible for three of the four occasions that a player has created four big chances in a Premier League game in the past three seasons, a reminder that while sometimes cast as part of the problem, he is surely among the victims of United's malaise.",
      "His efforts against City saw him bring up 600 chances created in his Premier League career, which is 168 more than Kevin De Bruyne, who is the next person on the list, since Fernandes' debut in the competition. Astonishing in what has often been an underwhelming side.",
      "Those numbers also indicate that he has not exactly been stifled under Amorim. In fact, he tops the charts for chances created this season too. Even so, it must make sense to get Fernandes closer to the opposition goal where he can do more damage from open play.",
      "The heatmaps from his Premier League career at United show that he was doing more of his work in his own half under Amorim, whose preferred formation does not have a natural role for a true No 10. Michael Carrick must be tempted to unleash him from there now.",
      "Because he can still make the difference. United's owners will look to Fernandes' age and the potential money that is on offer from Saudi Arabia and make their calculations. But there is also Champions League money to consider. And this Fernandes can deliver that.",
      "Florentino's performance in Burnley's surprise 1-1 draw at Liverpool did not showcase the same levels of creativity but he deserves huge credit for his attempts to shut down the reigning Premier League champions at Anfield. The midfielder made nine tackles.",
      "It is only the fifth time that a player has made nine tackles in a Premier League game this season - and Florentino has been responsible for two of them, having also done so against West Ham in November. This was perhaps his best game in a Burnley shirt.",
      "It was not perfect. He gave away a penalty that Dominik Szoboszlai missed. And some fans have been a little frustrated by his lack of care in possession. But his combative qualities were ideally suited to this particular challenge against Arne Slot's side.",
      "Perhaps Newcastle's goalless draw at Wolves should not have come as a surprise given that they started the season with three stalemates in their first three Premier League matches on the road. But it is just another example of their lack of cutting edge.",
      "Eddie Howe's side have now failed to score in three of their last four away from home. In fact, their only two Premier League victories on their travels have come after taking the lead inside two minutes. When charged with breaking teams down, they often struggle.",
      "Nick Woltemade has become something of a scapegoat for that, having not scored in his last seven appearances. But Newcastle's creativity problems run deeper. They are too passive in attack for a team that is at his best when showing real intensity in their play.",
      "Indeed, at Molineux they became the team to have registered the highest passing accuracy without a shot on target in the first half of a Premier League game since Opta began collecting such records. Wolves dropped deep. All Newcastle could do was cross the ball.",
      "Where was the movement inside, the movement around Woltemade? Wolves were happy to let Newcastle have the ball wide. Better chances might have come with some cute play in the half spaces. Without it, Howe's team can look a little one-dimensional.",

      "He also provided the cross for the late equaliser against Heidenheim at the weekend. Watching him up close on a bitterly cold day at the Volkswagen Arena, fans of the midfield maestro can rest assured that, even at the age of 33, the old Eriksen magic remains.",
      "His five chances created in the game were as many as his team-mates managed between them and included one lovely ball over the top that should have brought the opening goal. Playing off the right, he drops deep, floats around, has freedom to roam.",
      "In his pomp at Tottenham, Eriksen did all that and more and was arguably the Premier League's outstanding creative force. A big claim but the numbers support that. During his Spurs career nobody provided more assists or created more chances than the Dane.",
      "He also scored more goals from outside the box than any other Premier League player in that time. Wolfsburg fans have not seen one yet but this Rolls-Royce of a player feels at home in Volkswagen country. \"I just had a gut feeling it would suit me,\" he explains.",
      "\"I could see myself playing for Wolfsburg, trying the Bundesliga. It is a very open league. One team can be 3-0 up in the last 10 minutes and it can still end up 3-3. There is a lot going on and every team wants to play a little bit. It is an exciting league to watch and to play in.\"",
      "Remarkably, the Heidenheim game came 16 years to the day since Eriksen made his professional debut for Ajax. \"Has it been 16 years since my debut? I have had a fun 16 years,\" he says. \"It is still fun.\" But the hair is thinning and those team-mates are getting younger.",
      "\"All the new players coming up, they are born in the 2000s, even the late 2000s. That is weird,\" he says, smiling a little, amusing himself at the thought. \"I am around such young kids. At the same time, although in football terms I am obviously very old, I do not feel old.\"",
      "So, how exactly has football changed over these past 16 years, then? Where to begin. \"It has gone through different stages in terms of possession, then a bit of tactical work, then about possession again, then a lot of pressing, then a lot of athleticism,\" he explains.",
      "\"Now, there are a lot of stats going around, a lot of numbers you have got to hit, so there is a lot more time spent looking at the computer. You have to hit a certain amount of kilometres in training just to make sure you are in the right place for the next game.",
      "\"Years ago, that was not there. It was just on a hunch. Do you feel good? Okay, you are ready to go. Now, everything else is taken into consideration. What is your load? How many high-speed runs do you need to do? How many extra sprints do you need to do?\"",
      "He sounds a little bemused. \"Even strikers now are the first guys to press. Double runs, triple runs.\" But he has been able to adapt. And he has done so having come through that moment nobody will ever be able to forget at the European Championship in 2021.",
      "He almost lost more than his career that day in Copenhagen but recovered to add more chapters to his football story. Brentford offered a route back before he spent three seasons at Manchester United. But there was no role for him under Ruben Amorim.",
      "\"As a player, I did not feel he was going to look my way, in every sense. Of course, then you struggle a bit football-wise. But person-wise, we had a decent relationship, nothing wrong there. He has one idea. Maybe I was a style of player not really suited for him.\"",
      "He insists that he wants the best for the club and believes \"a new manager brings new ideas\" and sees it as a \"chance for everyone\" again. Kobbie Mainoo, especially? \"I hope for anyone, it does not matter if it is Kobbie or someone else. I hope the club has success.\"",
      "Eriksen is well placed to assess the issues at Spurs too, having played under Thomas Frank at Brentford. Is he surprised to see Frank's struggles? \"Yes and no,\" he says. \"I mean, the pressure is bigger. Of course, Brentford for a long time was a safe place.\"",
      "He adds: \"Now, he is in a new place with new eyes and people want something else. I hope he gets the time to change it and see what he can do. But I know football moves quickly and there are a lot of new ideas this week and then next week it will be another idea.\"",
      "If Eriksen sounds like he has seen it all in football, one wonders what is left for him. The World Cup playoffs in March are on his mind. \"The chance to play at the World Cup would be special. That is the first aim and to hopefully have a big tournament after,\" he says.",
      "His contract at Wolfsburg has another season to run after this and he is determined to see an improvement. \"We have lost way too many games this season. But we are on a better run now than we were before.\" As for the personal goals, well, they never change.",
      "\"Just to keep improving and just to have fun on a football pitch. I mean, that is what I have been doing for so many years,\" But does he cherish all this a bit more after what he has been through? \"I think I am just enjoying the moment, as I was before,\" he adds.",
      "\"But at the same time, I know what you can lose. So, I am happy with what I have. Maybe I am not cherishing it more but I am just enjoying what is ahead.\" What is certain is that we should cherish every opportunity we get to see Christian Eriksen playing football.",

      "Michael Carrick marked his Manchester United homecoming by restoring a familiar feeling as an attacking display secured his side derby day spoils with a 2-0 victory at Old Trafford.",
      "Having only been installed as head coach until the end of the season this week to replace the departed Ruben Amorim, United looked different and Old Trafford felt different.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo's opening goal, a fully deserved one, was one taken in vintage Man Utd fashion. Rayan Cherki's ball into the box, turned into a speedy three-pronged counterattack for United and Bruno Fernandes slipped in the goalscorer to net his seventh of the league season.",
      "Man Utd: Lammens (7), Dalot (6), Maguire (7), Martinez (7), Shaw (7), Casemiro (7), Mainoo (7), Bruno Fernandes (8), Dorgu (7), Mbeumo (8), Amad (7)\n\n\nSubs: Cunha (7), Ugarte (6), Heaven (n/a) Mount (7)\n\n\nMan City:  Donnarumma (7), Lewis (5), Khusanov (6), Alleyne (5), Ake (4), Rodri (6), Semenyo, (6), Foden (4), Bernado Siva (6), Doku (5), Haaland (3)\n\n\nSubs: O’Reilly (6), Cherki (5), Mukasa (n/a), Ait-Nouri (n/a), Reijnders (n/a)\n\n\nPlayer of the Match:  Mbeumo",
      "There were more shades of the past as Matheus Cunha, a second-half substitute, crossed into the area for Patrick Dorgu to finish.",
      "At that point, United had already had the ball in the back of the net twice with both finishes ruled out for offside. Both Amad Diallo and Fernandes thought they had given United the lead in the first half only to see the assistant referee's flag raised.",
      "It wasn't the last occasion, though, as Mason Mount came close to making it a derby day demolition when he thought he had added a third off the bench only for that to be struck off too.",
      "United's record number of offsides this season summed up a front-foot display that began when Harry Maguire's third-minute header crashed off the bar. Amad also saw a chance hit the goal frame late on with no side hitting the woodwork more than United in the Premier League this season.",
      "While United impressed, they were fortunate to have ended the game with 11 men after Diogo Dalot escaped what Mike Dean called \"100 per cent\" a sending off after a challenge on Jeremy Doku.",
      "Pep Guardiola, though, could only watch on as his side were played off the park as title-chasing Man City could only muster one shot on target, relying on five crucial Gianluigi Donnarumma saves to also avoid humiliation.",
      "City are now at risk of falling nine points behind league leaders Arsenal, who play Nottingham Forest later on Saturday. Man Utd, meanwhile, move up to fourth.",
      "\"Today was special. Putting things together quickly and trying to put an imprint on the team. Gathering together and emotionally getting attached to what we want to do. I felt that was unbelievable from the staff and the players.",
      "\"I am not getting carried away. It is one result, but it needs to be a regular feeling with that level of performance.\"",
      "\"The better team won. They had energy we didn't have. Congratulations to them.",
      "\"They had the chances at the end with crosses. We know they are a transitional team, but in general they were better.",
      "\"They start really strong, that's normal.",
      "\"We never made a threat, crosses or movement, but that's part of the energy.\"",
      "On Erling Haaland's substitution, Guardiola said the striker was taken off to introduce \"new energy\".",

      "Something about Manchester United's derby day was different, but it felt right.",
      "When Bryan Mbeumo scored his goal, the Stretford end roared. Not just because he had scored a timely goal in a dominant United display but because it represented what the Old Trafford faithful had explicitly or implicitly been crying out for.",
      "United galloped forward, led by Bruno Fernandes, flanked by Patrick Dorgu and Amad. Fearless, front foot and familiar. It was an attacking custom United have been used to.",
      "Though the 2-0 scoreline doesn't tell the story of United's control of the game, their season high of offsides that resulted in three disallowed goals reflect a tweaked style that got the best out of United's attacking array.",
      "Mbeumo down the middle, the player with the most runs in behind this season in the league per 90 down the middle proved a masterstroke. Fernandes, the league's chief creator, back in an advanced No 10 role was equally fitting as he made his ninth goal of the season.",
      "\"United's DNA\" has been questioned this week. Is it real? Should United underpin their whole plan on what feels like folklore? Should United move away from Sir Alex Ferguson-ball? Sir Alex was in the director's box smiling all afternoon long - why? Because Carrick made it all appear simple by taking it back to what United know best, in the best way, on the best possible occasion.William Bitibiri",
      "Tottenham are drifting towards a conversation they should never be part of.",
      "The 2-1 defeat to West Ham wasn't just another London derby loss to shrug off. It was a warning flare. Spurs are now priced at 50/1 for relegation, odds that still scream long shot, but it still tells an uncomfortable story. They are now just 10 points above the Hammers in the drop zone.",
      "And that, in itself, is the most damning indictment of all for Thomas Frank.",
      "Tottenham, a club in the Champions League and a holder of a European trophy, are better than this.",
      "Form is the driver of this narrative and it is ugly. Just four wins from the last 18 matches gives Frank a win percentage of 22 per cent. That is relegation-form. Spurs are leaking goals, losing control of games they should dominate and looking short on belief when momentum turns against them.",
      "There was a time when Tottenham pulled the trigger quickly in moments like this. Nuno Espirito Santo found that out the hard way. The irony will not be lost on Spurs supporters that the man now sitting in the West Ham dugout - having just beaten them - was dismissed with a 53 per cent win rate, more than double what Frank has delivered across the last 18 games.",
      "Frank was appointed to stabilise and progress the club. The opposite is happening.Lewis Jones",
      "Erling Haaland is Manchester City's greatest derby goalscorer of the Premier League era, but you would not have known it watching the 2-0 defeat at Old Trafford. This was a pale imitation of the machine-like striker that has devastated United on so many occasions.",
      "Pep Guardiola pulled him off once it was clear the game was over, soon after Patrick Dorgu crashed in United's second. The striker finished with 14 touches, three successful passes and not a single shot on target. City were lost without his goal threat.",
      "The fact Haaland was brought off for an 18-year-old midfielder, Divine Mukasa, with 15 minutes of prior Premier League experience shows how sparse the current attacking options are for Guardiola. Omar Marmoush's return from AFCON can't come soon enough.",
      "The City manager warned of Haaland being exhausted before the derby and his deteriorating output highlights the problem. The striker has not scored a non-penalty goal for seven games, his longest run without one since he signed for Borussia Dortmund in 2020.",
      "City have already signed winger Antoine Semenyo and are set to bring in centre-back Marc Guehi, but they could do with a striker to ease the burden on Haaland. Strength in depth has been a crucial factor behind Arsenal pulling away in the title race.",
      "There is still time to catch the Premier League leaders, although City's run of four games without a win does not instil confidence. No surprise that has coincided with Haaland's struggles in front of goal.",
      "The only world in which a title twist is imaginable is one in which Haaland is fit and firing on all cylinders. He looks in dire need of a rest. Until Haaland rediscovers some form, City have a big problem.Zinny Boswell",
      "Mikel Arteta has talked up the importance of rotation as Arsenal compete in four different competitions. They are on a gruelling run of four consecutive away games. But it still seemed strange that his most influential attacker was named on the bench against Nottingham Forest.",
      "There seemed no obvious need for it given Bukayo Saka had started only two of Arsenal's last four fixtures. Especially given the size of the opportunity presented by Manchester City's slip-up. What followed at the City Ground put the decision under even greater scrutiny.",
      "Arsenal laboured until Arteta's triple change early in the second half, after which Saka, on for Noni Madueke, looked by far the most likely player to make the breakthrough. He very nearly did, denied by Matz Sels at full-stretch when his header was bound for the corner.",
      "The draw is far from disastrous. Arsenal have added to their lead at the top of the table. But Arsenal supporters are entitled to wonder whether the outcome would have been different had Saka started the game rather than come into it late.Nick Wright",
      "Full-backs at Liverpool are going to be judged harshly. The shadow of those before you is long. But Milos Kerkez has stopped looking like a player learning his surroundings and started performing like one shaping them. Liverpool didn't get the result they wanted against Burnley but there were more positive signs that Kerkez is starting to look like the player they signed from Bournemouth.",
      "His game is built on intensity, but what has impressed most over recent weeks is control.",
      "After being likened to a youth player earlier this season by Gary Neville, there is a calmness to his positioning now, a better understanding of when to go and when to stay. Early-season exuberance has been refined into efficiency. He provided a real thrust down the left against Burnley and more assurance in his decision-making. No player created more chances (6) than him as he continually penetrated with conviction down the left flank.",
      "He looks stronger, sharper, and more attuned to the demands Slot wants. It bodes well for the future.Lewis Jones",
      "Chelsea won a game in which the spotlight once again shone firmly on Robert Sanchez - but this time, he stood up to it.",
      "The Chelsea goalkeeper has spent much of the last few seasons under constant scrutiny, with questions raised about his decision-making and reliability. On another afternoon, that pressure could easily have told. Brentford created enough chances to punish Chelsea, particularly in transition, and Sanchez was tested early and often.",
      "This was not a flawless Chelsea performance, but two things stood out.",
      "First, Sanchez’s response to pressure. The Spaniard produced several crucial saves, most notably racing off his line to deny Kevin Schade when the Brentford forward was clean through, moments that could easily have shifted the momentum of the game. For a player whose confidence has been questioned, those interventions mattered.",
      "Secondly, Chelsea’s growing ability to manage moments of danger. Even when Brentford threatened to force their way back into the contest, Chelsea remained composed enough to see the game out, with Sanchez providing a calm presence behind a defence that has not always looked settled.",
      "There will still be debate around Chelsea’s long-term solution in goal, but on this occasion, Robert Sanchez delivered when it mattered, and Chelsea took full advantage at the other end.",
      "Sometimes survival is just as important as style.Sam Cohen",
      "All is not well at Crystal Palace. The signs have perhaps been there for some times, certainly in terms of performances and results, but the last 36 hours have blown the roof off.",
      "First, there were the revelations that both Oliver Glasner and Marc Guehi were heading for the exit. Rumours had circulated for some time on both and were perhaps not a surprise, but the manner in which the Austrian manager delivered them was.",
      "Usually a calm character, Friday's news conference and Glasner's bombshells pointed towards a shift at the club - one that just nine months ago, were basking in FA Cup glory.",
      "And after a 2-1 defeat at Sunderland, in which Glasner says he was unable to bring on any substitutes to help the team, the manager took aim at the club's hierarchy over the timing of Guehi's departure.",
      "It's a direct challenge to the chairman - back me or sack me. So far, by Glasner's calculations, Parish hasn't done the former and managers who have challenged the club this season have often found themselves ousted not long after.",
      "On the pitch, it's now ten games and over a month without a win for Crystal Palace in all competitions. They are missing the likes of Ismaila Sarr and Daniel Munoz, although they should return soon.",
      "That will give the Eagles a much needed boost, but will likely do little to repair the relationship between manager and chairman. How that plays out for the remainder of the season will be an intriguing prospect.Charlotte Marsh",
      "The Stadium of Light has always been one of football's great grounds, and this season, Sunderland have made it their fortress.",
      "The Black Cats remain unbeaten there in the Premier League this season, which might come as somewhat of a surprise considering they lost their last three regular season games at the ground last term.",
      "Perhaps what is most impressive is the ability to come from behind to take points. They did so again against Crystal Palace on Saturday, and never looked harangued when going behind.",
      "Rege Le Bris praised the maturity and confidence of his team, and they certainly showed it. Especially in the second half, they remained patient before finally getting their deserved winner.",
      "Along with Leeds, the two promoted sides are harnessing the magic of their home support to help keep them in the league. In fact, Sunderland are just three points from the top four - a European push is more likely to happen than a relegation battle.",
      "It's been a sensational return to the Premier League for Sunderland and it will take some performance to end their unbeaten home league run.Charlotte Marsh",
      "It was one of those points that felt like considerably more than a point.",
      "Scott Parker's masterplan to take something from Anfield didn't involve conceding 32 shots, or Dominic Szoboszlai crashing a penalty off the bar, but it did without doubt revolve around the notion of staying in the fight.",
      "Burnley didn't flinch when Liverpool knocked on the door in the opening half hour. They didn't flinch when Florian Wirtz forced it open, either.",
      "Despite their lead it was Liverpool playing with urgency after the break. Without a second it was inevitable that Burnley would break out of their low block, if momentarily, and push for an equaliser.",
      "That part of the plan was executed to perfection. Ibrahima Konate nearly turned his ball into his own net moments before Marcus Edwards brought Burnley level.",
      "\"You never say die\" said Kyle Walker of his side's showing on Saturday. On a day when Leeds and West Ham won, Burnley's rope-a-dope point at Anfield could yet be pivotal in the battle to stay alive in the Premier League.Michael Morrow",
      "The screams of delight from Elland Road after Lukas Nmecha's last-gasp winner were so loud that you probably could have heard them from Barnsley.",
      "That's been the story at home for Leeds recently. They're now unbeaten across their last five Premier League home matches - gaining points from Chelsea, Liverpool, Man Utd, and now an in-form Fulham side - and that run doesn't look like ending any time soon.",
      "Farke's revamped side have embodied a powerful, gritty style of play that the home fans are finding it easy to get behind.",
      "Their win today was earmarked by two 10-minute periods in which the powerful Leeds attack terrorised the frail Fulham defence. Leeds' two best chances - Calvert-Lewin's inexplicable miss from six yards out, and Brendan Aaronson's scuffed half-volley one-on-one with Bernd Leno - came when the home crowd was spurring them on the most, and should've resulted in goals.",
      "Just when the game looked gone, and Fulham's defence grew in confidence, the Elland Road roar got Leeds back in the game, just in time to rattle Fulham into three mistimed tackles, in turn creating the winning opportunity.",
      "\"To play at Elland Road, we all know what it means. The home support is unbelievable and they make it hard for the opposition,\" said opposition manager Marco Silva before the game. \"It is never easy to play there.\"",
      "And so it proved, as it has for almost every opposition side of late.",
      "With Farke's side continuing to grind out results with the help of their home crowd, it's hard to see any team remaining unfazed with a trip to Elland Road on the calendar.Noah Langford",
      "Fulham's recent unbeaten run has been so impressive that recent clamour for reinforcements seemed to have taken a back seat.",
      "Today's loss at Leeds is a harsh reality check for Marco Silva and his men, and demonstrates what Fulham fans know all too well - that the club will stagnate without new signings imminently.",
      "New injuries to Sasa Lukic and Emile Smith Rowe may take the headlines, but they are the least of Fulham's problems. The whites had just seven touches in the Leeds United box, their fewest in a Premier League game since December 2024.",
      "With Rodrigo Muniz out until February and Raul Jimenez having a poor game, Silva's only option up top from the bench was Jonah Kusi-Asare, the 18-year old Bayern loanee who is yet to score a professional goal outside the German fourth division.",
      "There are two weeks left in the January window - despite being heavily linked with attacking reinforcements, Fulham are yet to make a signing.",
      "\"Everything we try and do this January, we are relying on it. We are completely aligned,\" Silva said at a recent press conference.",
      "\"For me, it's tougher than the summer. If you sign players, they have to make an impact. Not just short term, for the long term.\"",
      "Should they fail to bring new faces, Fulham will be left not just short of players to make a push for Europe, but also possibly short of a manager to match their ambition come the end of the season.Noah Langford",
      "Nottingham Forest had one of the best defences in the Premier League last season but clean sheets have been hard to come by this term. Saturday's stalemate with Arsenal was just their fifth of the campaign - all of them have come under Sean Dyche.",
      "Holding the Premier League leaders felt very much like a Nuno Espirito Santo display from last season and there was a reason for it.",
      "This was the first game since August when Forest could start Matz Sels, Ola Aina, Murillo, Nikola Milenkovic and Neco Williams in a match. That was the back five that gave opposition attacks so little joy last term and it was the same for Arsenal on Saturday.",
      "Milenkovic and Murillo made 15 clearances between them. Williams won seven duels when he was up against Noni Madueke and Bukayo Saka. Out of the back four, Aina won most possessions in the defensive and middle thirds.",
      "But in front of them was the star of the show in Elliot Anderson, winning 12 out of his 15 duels. Only William Saliba made more ball recoveries than the England international, who won the battle with Declan Rice in midfield.",
      "Forest may have been dragged closer to the drop zone by West Ham winning but if they keep defending like this, they will be fine in terms of survival.Sam Blitz",
