      "The Carabao Cup first round is nearly done and dusted - and now Premier League teams are preparing to come into the fray. That includes six-time winners Manchester United, who enter at the second-round stage for the first time in 11 years.",
      "That's because the Red Devils aren't one of the nine top-flight teams who've qualified for Europe this season. The last time that United played in the second round was in 2014, as League One MK Dons pulled off a famous 4-0 win against Louis van Gaal's side.",
      "Another club will be looking to stage their own giant-killing against United, and we've already had some in the first round. Doncaster Rovers humiliated Championship outfit Middlesbrough 4-0 in their own backyard while Bromley beat Ipswich Town on penalties.",
      "That was one of five penalty shootouts on Tuesday, as 29 teams booked their place in the draw. A further five will go through tonight, with only Tranmere Rovers' clash with Burton Albion - postponed due to a power cut - left to be played.",
      "Here are the ball numbers for the second round of the Carabao Cup.",
      "The competition remains split into northern and southern sections until round three.",

      "The young midfielder recently joined the club's pre-season tour of the United States and made an appearance in the second half of the 2-1 victory over West Ham United at the MetLife Stadium in New Jersey. He also came off the bench in the 0-0 draw against Leeds United that preceded the US tour.",
      "Despite scoring four goals in nine Premier League 2 appearances for United's Under-21s last season, the 18 year old is yet to make his competitive first-team debut for the club. However, he was named on the bench on seven occasions last season.",
      "As they prepare for Sunday's Premier League curtain-raiser against the Gunners, United are not exactly flush with midfield options. The club's website highlights just how thin on the ground United are in that particular department.",

      "Manchester United have been advised that they can secure a top-five finish by making one more crucial signing; Aston Villa goalkeeper Emiliano Martinez. Ruben Amorim has been hard at work reshaping his squad this summer following a lacklustre first season in the Premier League.",
      "United's attacking prowess has been significantly enhanced with the signings of Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko. Brighton star Carlos Baleba is also on United's radar as they aim to bolster their midfield options.",
      "However, Amorim still faces a conundrum in goal as he seeks to provide competition for current No. 1 keeper Andre Onana. The Cameroonian sat out United's pre-season due to a hamstring injury and was guilty of several high-profile blunders last term.",
      "Paris Saint-Germain's Gianluigi Donnarumma has been touted as a potential addition at Old Trafford. However, French newspaper L'Equipe reports that an agreement has already been reached between him and local rivals Manchester City, with Pep Guardiola seemingly set to thwart any move to United, despite having already brought back James Trafford from Burnley this summer.",
      "Ex-United and Wrexham shot-stopper Ben Foster has now urged his former club to refocus their attention on signing Villa's Martinez. A loan switch for the Argentinian was mentioned earlier in the transfer window, and was reportedly turned down by Villa.",
      "Foster reckons he could be the crucial component to help United secure a top-five finish this season, which would now guarantee them Champions League football for the subsequent campaign.",
      "Speaking on his Fozcast podcast, he said: \"United have got a better chance of doing it this year. I've loved United's transfer window. I think it's taken them and changed them from having another mid-table disappointment of a season to genuinely looking like competing alongside Newcastle and Villa.",
      "\"I think that if United get off to a good start, they can finish fifth this season. If they get another goalkeeper in, and if Emi Martinez has signed for Man United, they finish fifth this season.\"",
      "Martinez sparked concerns amongst Villa supporters that he was poised to depart the club after what seemed to be an emotional farewell at the conclusion of last season. As he left the pitch following the final home match of the campaign, he tearfully gestured to the fans before heading off the pitch.",
      "Villa are believed to have informed United that it would require an exceptional bid of around Â£40million to part with their first-choice keeper. Last month, The Athletic reported that the club would not be pursuing Martinez further due to the asking price and substantial wage demands.",
      "Meanwhile, former Arsenal defender Philippe Senderos has suggested that United should consider signing Inter Milan goalkeeper Yann Sommer.",
      "\"I think Yann Sommer is a very, very experienced player and a calming presence,\" Senderos told BoyleSports. \"He makes the defence better because of that presence.",
      "\"I can't really judge Andre Onana in this situation, but if United were to target Yann Sommer, I'd really believe he'd add invaluable experience.",
      "\"It's about how he is as a person, how he is on the pitch. He's a great character and amazing in what he brings to a defence. We've seen it with Inter Milan and Bayern Munich the year before.\"",

      "Benjamin Sesko has been reunited with his favourite No. 30 shirt at Manchester United, after fellow summer signing Diego Leon gave him the number. Sesko, 22, was unveiled at Old Trafford during United's recent friendly against Fiorentina.",
      "He arrived in a deal worth Â£66.4million with potential add-ons of up to Â£7.6m. There will be a lot of pressure on Sesko, as well as fellow forward recruits Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo.",
      "It has become apparent his new team-mates are doing their best to make himself feel at home. One star who has gone above and beyond is Leon, who gave up his first ever United shirt number to give it to the Slovenian international.",
      "Leon, who arrived shortly after Cunha from Paraguayan side Club Cerro Porteno, was initially given the No.30 shirt when he joined the club. After Sesko arrived, the young left back gave up his number - despite wearing it in friendlies against West Ham United and Bournemouth - so the forward can be handed his favourite shirt.",
      "For Leon, his move to United is a significant moment in his young career and it's likely his first United shirt will mean a lot to him. His decision to part with it and take the No.35 instead demonstrates his selflessness and ability to see the bigger picture.",
      "Sesko has worn the No.30 since 2020, when he was playing for RB Salzburg, before moving to RB Leipzig in the 2023-24 campaign. After his arrival on the red side of Manchester, he was paraded to jubilant United fans at Old Trafford, before his new side went on to draw 1-1 with Fiorentina.",
      "Shortly after securing his move, Sesko did not contain his excitement. He told the official Manchester United website: \"It's just a historical club that is unbelievable. For me, the team is great.",
      "\"It is getting better and better and that's why also there is just stuff that makes you come there, gives you this energy that you want to be part of. I think it's a great project, in general, and I can't wait to start, definitely.",
      "\"It's already been amazing. I can already feel that we're going to be a great family and it is a pleasure to be part of it. It feels good.",
      "\"The thing is it [the badge] fits well and I'm looking forward to just playing in it a lot and to represent the club in the best way possible.\"",
      "Big things will be expected from Sesko, who was also subject to immense interest from Newcastle United in the summer and from Arsenal, until the north Londoners opted to focus on Viktor Gyokeres instead.",
      "Last season, Sesko contributed 21 goals and six assists in 45 appearances in all competitions for Leipzig. He was particularly impressive in the Champions League, where he netted four goals in eight appearances.",

      "Rio Ferdinand and Paul Scholes are at odds over Manchester United's decision to splash out on Benjamin Sesko. Scholes fears the club is repeating past mistakes made with Rasmus Hojlund, but Ferdinand feels differently.",
      "The Slovenian international has officially put pen to paper on a five-year deal with the Red Devils after RB Leipzig accepted a bid of Â£66.4million plus Â£7.6m in add-ons. With a total package worth Â£74m, United pipped Newcastle to the post for Sesko's signature after the Magpies launched their bid earlier in July.",
      "Despite Newcastle offering the striker a more lucrative wage package than United, Ruben Amorim's project persuaded the 22-year-old to turn down the north east and the promise of Champions League football this season. However, United legend Scholes believes that Sesko may have made an error in choosing his former club. He fears the fans will scrutinise the young striker as they did previously with Hojlund.",
      "During The Overlap Fan Debate last week, the ex-United midfielder expressed his belief that Newcastle would have been a better place for young Sesko to develop. Scholes said: \"From the point of Sesko... he'll have more chance at Newcastle to develop which he needs. Now to be a Manchester United centre-forward, as we've found with Hojlund, a 22-year-old kid, you've got to be ready.",
      "\"It's got to be now. And Hojlund just isn't quite good enough for that as we've seen. But again, he's not had a chance to be developed â going to Newcastle might have been the best thing for him, for two or three years.\"",
      "However, the former England international recognised the potential for future success at Old Trafford, but remained adamant in his belief that Sesko should have opted for Eddie Howe's side. He added: \"Which club are going to be successful first? Are Man United going to win the league before Newcastle â if they ever do? Of course they are.",
      "\"That's why he wants to go there, but I'm saying, from a United point of view, is it the best bit of business? I still think you're in the same boat as having Hojlund.\"",
      "Despite Scholes' reservations, another former United legend believes that Sesko arrives at the club with considerably more experience than Hojlund possessed in 2023. Ferdinand continued the debate on his YouTube channel, Rio Presents, protesting that Sesko will thrive in Manchester.",
      "Ferdinand said: \"Now we've got someone who's not as experienced but he's more experienced than Rasmus Hojlund. He's played probably almost double the amount of games as Hojlund when he came, he's two years older than what Rasmus Hojlund was when he signed.",
      "\"And he's shown that he can score goals. He hasn't gone and blitzed it and scored a ridiculous amount of goals, but he's a kid. He's young. Again, we can't expect that. I don't see him coming in and scoring 25 Premier League goals, or 20 Premier League goals.",
      "\"If he comes and scores between 10 and 15, I think that's an unbelievable return.\"",
      "When quizzed on why he believes Sesko will fare better at United than Hojlund has managed, Ferdinand added: \"Well, I think it's more hope at the moment. I think we've got to wait and see man. I think because you look at it and go, when Hojlund came and when Amorim came during the season, it's a new way of playing, a new style, a new environment.",
      "\"The manager was finding his feet and also you have a number nine finding his feet. So under Amorim, that's the way it's been for him [Rasmus]. So hopefully, there's a clearer picture, a clearer identity given the preseason that we've had.",
      "\"There's more goals, like I said, and players that understand the Premier League getting more experience up top, in the top end of the pitch. You'd like to think that counts for a lot going into the new season, to help a new number nine coming into the building.\"",
      "Whilst the two United icons might disagree over Sesko's potential impact at Old Trafford, the most crucial viewpoint belongs to the striker himself â and he certainly believes in his ability to restore glory to the Theatre of Dreams.",
      "In an interview with MUTV, the 22-year-old said: \"For me, the team is great. It is getting better and better and that's why also there is just stuff that makes you come there, gives you this energy that you want to be part of. I think it's a great project, in general, and I can't wait to start, definitely.",
      "\"I've just been here for a couple of hours and it's already been amazing. I can already feel that we're going to be a great family and it is a pleasure to be part of it.",
      "\"It feels good, you know, the thing is it [the badge] fits well and I'm looking forward to just playing in it a lot and try to represent in the good ways possible.\"",
      "With speculation surrounding his future at United, current number nine Hojlund previously insisted he will fight for his place in the squad.",
      "During the recent pre-season tour in America, the Danish striker said: \"I think my plan is very clear and that is for me to stay and fight for my spot, whatever happens. I'm still very young. I think people forget that sometimes. I'm only 22. Obviously, not every striker is scoring 100 goals at the age of 22.",
      "\"Competition is fine with me. It sharpens me. I'm more than ready. I'm feeling sharp, so I'm welcoming everything that comes. I think it's good with competition and it only sharpens the team.\"",
      "Since then, however, it appears that Hojlund has warmed to the idea of a move to AC Milan. Only time will tell if he'll be giving Sesko a run for his money in the squad this season.",

      "Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko have all arrived at Old Trafford to bolster Amorim's squad, and Silvestre, who made over 350 appearances for the Red Devils, believes his job could be in danger should they enter crisis mode after a poor start.",
      "\"I don't think [Ruben] Amorim is under any more pressure than any other manager in the Premier League, to be honest,\" Silvestre exclusively told Ladbrokes.",
      "\"I think they're all under pressure, it's just that he's at Manchester United, and they've now spent a lot of money. It's the size of the club, coupled with the interest from the media which makes it feel like there's more pressure there.",
      "\"There might be some pressure from the owners this season, but I would say that's the same with every other club. Amorim will go into this season under the same amount of pressure as every other manager; it's a fresh start.",
      "\"But, if you start losing three games in a row, and find yourself in that kind of form, that's when the crisis will start. That's when there's real pressure. For now, everyone is on zero points, they should all be treated the same and everyone will be judged against their objectives for the season.\"",
      "On the back of some promising transfer activity, Silvestre thinks the aim for United this season should be European football, but perhaps not the Champions League.",
      "\"As for my expectations of the club this season, they need to be qualifying for Europe,\" he continued. \"The Champions League isn't necessarily the target, but European football of any kind definitely is.",
      "\"Of course, everyone will always talk about the Champions League, but I just think that given the lack of consistency last season, I'm sceptical about their chances on that front.\"",
      "The defender also feels that jumping from a 15th-placed finish to the top four could be too tall an order, and has predicted a more modest top-flight finish for his former club.",
      "\"As for where they finish in the table, I'd say maybe sixth or seventh? I don't see them in the top four or five,\" declared the Frenchman. \"It's crazy saying that, to be honest. It just sounds so unfamiliar when we're talking about Manchester United, but that's the position the club is in right now, unfortunately.",
      "\"You know, you've got to be realistic about what the team has been achieving in recent years. OK, there are new players in place now, and a completely new dynamic. But in terms of dominating other teams and getting consistency, there are still a lot of question marks, in my opinion.\"",

      "Manchester United have forced 'hurt' Barcelona to alter their transfer plans by completing the signing of Benjamin Sesko for Â£74million. Sesko, 22, joined the Red Devils last week on a five-year contract, keeping him at Old Trafford until 2030.",
      "The Slovenian is considered one of the best young strikers in Europe, having spent the last two seasons developing with RB Leipzig. Sesko scored 39 goals in 87 appearances for the German club, proving himself in both the Bundesliga and the Champions League.",
      "Amid their search for a new striker, United made him their top target and beat Newcastle in a fiercely-contested race for his signature. But it turns out that Newcastle weren't the only ones to miss out.",
      "Barcelona were in fact considering a move for Sesko next summer. Catalan outlet Sport claim that Barca's management are particularly hurt by the 22-year-old's switch to Old Trafford.",
      "Sesko is highly rated by Barcelona sporting director Deco, who's working on a signing a successor to Robert Lewandowski in the summer of 2026. Lewandowski, who turns 37 later this month, has entered the final year of his contract with Barca and is likely to leave at the end of this season.",
      "Barcelona chiefs were well aware that Sesko wasn't guaranteed to remain at Leipzig for another year, so they weren't taken by surprise when United swooped. It's added that the La Liga chiefs weren't in a position to challenge the Red Devils for his signature due to their well-documented financial woes.",
      "Now Barca will focus on alternative targets, having previously been linked with Atletico Madrid forward Julian Alvarez, Newcastle's Alexander Isak - who could also be changing clubs this summer - and Manchester City superstar Erling Haaland, who signed a mammoth 10-year contract extension in January.",
      "Haaland is reportedly Barcelona president Joan Laporta's dream signing, telling TV3 in May: \"Nothing is impossible. But we're not thinking about that right now. He also just signed a new contract.\"",
      "Who should Barcelona target as an alternative? Let us know your pick in the comments section.",
      "The Blaugrana head into the new campaign with Lewandowski as their only recognised No.9. The Pole will miss Saturday's opening game against Mallorca due to injury, leaving the door open for Marcus Rashford, Ferran Torres or Dani Olmo to fill the void.",
      "Rashford is on loan from United, who've given Barca the option to sign him permanently for Â£26m at the end of the season. Torres was an able deputy last term, scoring 19 goals.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Dominic Calvert-Lewin is poised to join Leeds after his summer search for a new club finally yielded a breakthrough.",
      "Calvert-Lewin has been looking for a new team after leaving Everton as a free agent on July 1. The 28-year-old striker spent nine years on the books at Goodison Park, scoring 71 goals in 274 appearances for Everton, but has struggled with injuries.",
      "He was linked with moves to Manchester United and Newcastle, but nothing materialised. Calvert-Lewin reportedly took the step of dismissing his agent to speed up the process and he now appears to have found a new home at Leeds.",
      "The Athletic reports that he has agreed terms in principle with the newly-promoted Premier League side and will undergo a medical. His lack of an agent will mean that Calvert-Lewin will be leading negotiations himself with Leeds, where he will compete with Joel Piroe and Lukas Nmecha for a place in Daniel Farkeâs side.",
      "He was offered a new contract by Everton last summer, but an agreement was never reached and, after another difficult campaign, the two parted company on good terms. âThis isnât something I chose lightly,â he said after leaving.",
      "âEverton has been my home since I was 19 years old. Itâs the place that saw potential in me, challenged me to grow, and shaped me both as a footballer and as a man.â",
      "His move to Leeds will please Rio Ferdinand, who had been baffled when the Red Devils were linked with a move for the striker, who has four goals in 11 appearances for England. Speaking on his Rio Ferdinand Presents podcast, he said: âDominic Calvert-Lewin cannot stay fit. Why are you bringing him into this club?",
      "âThis club is built on the academy. You have Chido Obi just sitting there. Play him if you're going to think about five or six games. Not somebody who is older and cannot stay fit.â United have since signed Benjamin Sesko, in a Â£74million deal from RB Leipzig, to play alongside Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha.",
      "The major black mark against Calvert-Lewin has always been his injury record. He played just 26 times for Everton, scoring three times, last season and David Moyes admitted that his difficulties in staying fit were the main reason behind his departure.",
      "âI'll make the final decision, but Dom has to show us he's robust and can be fit to play,â he said in May. âUndoubtedly he's got qualities other strikers don't have, and he has to show us all when he gets the opportunities that he'll take it. We need him to be ready to train, play, be competitive in more games than he's been available for.â",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Manchester United were warned about splashing the cash on under-fire forward Rasmus Hojlund before they parted with Â£72million for the striker in August 2023. After a promising debut season, Hojlund has struggled at Old Trafford.",
      "The recent arrival of Benjamin Sesko from RB Leipzig, in a deal worth Â£74m, has now also increased the competition for the young Dane in United's forward areas. Hojlund, 22, appears to have had a change of heart on his future too, despite claiming he would stay and fight for his place at United earlier on in the summer, with AC Milan now linked with a swoop.",
      "However, United could have avoided paying over the odds for a player that was once targeted by club co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe for underperforming. According to The Telegraph, Unitedâs data financial modelling claimed that Hojlund, who was playing for Atalanta in Serie A at the time, was actually worth Â£50m.",
      "Regardless, United chiefs stormed ahead with the move, paying Â£22m more than was recommended for the striker. Hojlund has since seen his valuation drop rapidly. The Denmark international, who has scored 26 goals in 95 games for the club, is now valued at around Â£30m by United.",
      "Not only did United's own data team warn about signing Hojlund, but his own manager at Atalanta, Gian Piero Gasperini, claimed the move to Old Trafford was coming too soon for Hojlund.",
      "The current Roma boss helped Hojlund become a force to be reckoned with in Bergamo, with the youngster scoring 10 goals and providing four assists in 34 games. But he harboured doubts on Hojlund continuing his development at United.",
      "\"I think so (Hojlund should stay one more season),\" the 67-year-old said. \"Then after that itâs difficult. He undoubtedly has great talent, but also great room for improvement. These things are visible in both senses, he must work to improve because he has the characteristics to become one of the strongest strikers in the world.â",
      "Gasperini's concerns were echoed by two top scouts as former United boss Erik ten Hag circled a move for the player. One said: \"Heâs still unproven and the Premier League is a very unforgiving place especially if youâre in a Manchester United shirt.",
      "\"Heâs left-footed, strong and powerful so inevitably there will be some comparisons with [Erling] Haaland but heâs not in his league. Haaland is a generational talent. Hojlundâs stats donât come anywhere near Haaland and his finishing can be erratic.\"",
      "Hojlund is only two years into a five-year deal at United but the club decided earlier this year to cash in if they recruited a new centre forward, something they have now done with Sesko. United had hoped to offload Hojlund on a permanent deal this summer, but Milan are seeking to bring him on loan to the San Siro.",
      "Hojlund was an unused substitute in United's pre-season 1-1 draw with Fiorentina, which actually marked the first time he did not appear in any of United's five pre-season matches this summer.",
      "Yet sources close to Hojlund felt he would have to leave United should they bolster their forward line with Sesko. Ruben Amorim has also refused to give assurances that the player would stay, suggesting Hojlund's time at Old Trafford now looks to be coming to an end.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "The recruitment team at Manchester United has been given a boost by the arrival of a key former ally to Lewis Hamilton. Michael Sansoni spent more than a decade working in Formula 1 for the Mercedes team and contributed to eight team's championships and six of the seven titles won by Brit Hamilton.",
      "An enormous amount of data is collected and analysed at every single F1 race and Sansoni has a wealth of experience when it comes to deciphering it. During his time at Mercedes, he rose to the position of performance engineer working specifically with Hamilton.",
      "But he left the team, which is one-third owned by Jim Ratcliffe through is INEOS petrochemicals company, earlier this year for a move to the British billionaire's flagship investment. Sansoni has been confirmed as the club's new director of data.",
      "\"Reporting to Omar Berrada, chief executive, Sansoni will be responsible for transforming the club's capabilities in data and artificial intelligence, drawing on his experience in machine learning and advanced modelling in Formula 1,\" a club statement read.",
      "\"He has been tasked with establishing Manchester United as a data-led organisation, embedding predictive and AI-driven decision-making across football and the wider club. To support these objectives, further recruitment is planned into a number of data, software and platform engineering roles in the coming months, as Sansoni builds out his team.\"",
      "And it seems their new recruit has begun in earnest. In a post on social media site LinkedIn, Sansoni suggested that two of Man United's major summer signings so far, forwards Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbuemo who cost the Old Trafford club a combined Â£133.5million, were identified as a result of his data-led efforts.",
      "He wrote: \"I am very lucky to have had not just one, but two dream jobs. After a phenomenal time in Formula 1, it is a privilege to now be part of the biggest club in world football.",
      "\"Over the past few months, we have already made meaningful progress. With new methodologies starting to take shape and two fantastic signings, Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo, already reflecting some of that early work.",
      "\"I have inherited a brilliant team: smart, committed, and hungry to make a difference and together we are building a world-class data and AI function to power decision-making across football and the wider club. The challenge is great, but so is the opportunity.\"",
      "Man United have also added Benjamin Sesko this summer, signing the striker from Bundesliga club RB Leipzig in a deal worth up to Â£74m. And they have been heavily linked with a swoop for Brighton midfielder Carlos Baleba who would also command a significant transfer fee, should the Seagulls be willing to sell.",

      "Alexander Isak and Newcastle United have reached a bitter stalemate as the star striker pushes for an exit. But the Swede's career could have panned out differently if he had left former employers Real Sociedad for another Premier League heavyweight three years ago.",
      "The 25-year-old made his feelings known last month when he told the Magpies he wanted to leave, and after Liverpool saw a Â£110million bid rejected for him, neither party has budged. Eddie Howe's side remain adamant he is not for sale and will don a Newcastle shirt this season, while the player is said to be refusing to play for the club again.",
      "Having caught Borussia Dortmund's eye whilst playing in his native Sweden, Isak signed for the German side but left for Spain in 2019 after finding minutes hard to come by. With Sociedad, he became one of La Liga's most revered strikers, leaving many top sides vying for his signature. One of those interested parties was Pep Guardiola's Manchester City.",
      "Speaking in 2024, years after Isak made his Newcastle switch, Guardiola admitted: \"At Real Sociedad, we started to follow him, we were impressed. He was a target. With his skills, all the clubs around the world take a look. I think he adapted really, really well in the Premier League.\"",
      "City's reason for not pursuing Isak more vigorously? Erling Haaland. The Athletic reported in the summer of 2022 that the Norwegian was Guardiola's priority No. 1, ahead of Isak, and Haaland's arrival even persuaded him to pen a new contract with the club.",
      "The Spaniard got his way as Haaland's Â£51m Dortmund release clause was met that July, and he has become a two-time Premier League Golden Boot winner, scoring 85 league goals since 2022, to the 54 of Isak, who arrived in England a few months after him.",
      "City were reportedly not the only club in Manchester to admire Isak, as rivals Manchester United were claimed to have submitted a 'juicy offer' to the Swede that summer.",
      "Mundo Deportivo reported that before Isak completed his Â£63m move to Newcastle, the Red Devils, then led by Erik ten Hag, were in touch with his representatives, who persuaded the striker to decline their advances.",
      "Sociedad never received a bid from United for Isak, and having lost out on his signature, Ten Hag began his first season in charge with Cristiano Ronaldo leading the line, though that infamously only lasted until November.",
      "Arsenal were yet another club that had Isak on their radar before he signed for the Magpies, and they perhaps came the closest to securing his signature with an informal offer.",
      "The Gunners sought to replace Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang up front and saw Isak as the ideal recruit. However, when approaching him in January 2022, they encountered some discrepancies regarding the Swede's price tag.",
      "Mikel Arteta's side tabled an informal Â£56m offer, which was far lower than Sociedad's estimations, as they were sticking to Isak's Â£74.7m release clause. The Athletic reported that this fee was just too much for Arsenal, who saw him as 'overpriced,' and Isak ended up at St. James' Park the following summer while continuing to be monitored by the Gunners.",
      "A fee of Â£75m would now be considered a bargain for Isak, who, after Liverpool's Â£120m bid was rejected, is thought to be valued at a potential British record transfer sum of Â£150m by Newcastle.",

      "Harry Maguire admits he was gutted to lose the Manchester United captaincy - but was thrilled Bruno Fernandes was the one given the armband.",
      "In January 2020, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer named Maguire Red Devils captain, a matter of months after his Â£80million move from Leicester City. His turbulent reign as skipper, which saw him face enormous levels of criticism as United struggled under Solskjaer and Ralf Rangnick, ended in 2023, when Erik ten Hag stripped him of the captaincy.",
      "The ex-United boss handed the armband to Fernandes, who continues to wear it to this day. While Maguire admitted he was heartbroken to lose the honour, he wanted to do everything he could to help his Portuguese team-mate.",
      "Speaking on 'Rio Ferdinand Presents', Maguire said: \"When I was captain, Bruno gave me his full support. I leant on Bruno a lot to be honest.",
      "\"Whenever I had decisions to make, I had people around me like (David) De Gea, Bruno and Nemanja (Matic). I had good experienced pros there and I always leant on them. I built a good relationship with Bruno when I was captain.",
      "\"Obviously, Erik decided to change the captaincy because I was not playing in that first season. I really wanted it to go to Bruno if Iâm being honest and I told Bruno the same. He came up to me and I spoke to him. I said, 'Look, congratulations.'\"",
      "When the legendary United defender pushed Maguire to offer an insight into the conversation between him and Ten Hag, the 64-cap England international said: \"It was a sticky conversation. The season before, I just didnât feel as important to the club as I did under Ole.",
      "\"I think if you're the captain, you need to feel important, you need to have the backing of the manager, you need to have the backing of all the team. If you don't it doesn't work.",
      "\"Bruno was Erik's guy. Bruno is a great leader. Like I said to Bruno, I said, 'If I have to give it away to anyone - and I didn't want to give it away to anyone - he'd be the man I would want to take this club forward.'",
      "\"He's a fantastic player, a great leader and, most importantly, he puts other people first. I think that's a big trait to have when you are a captain. He cares about others, he cares about improving others, he cares about helping others.",
      "\"There's a lot of players in this game who obviously play for themselves, rightly so it takes them far. But there's also a lot of players who care about the team and making other people better and making young lads come through, feel comfortable and Bruno is one of those.\"",

Last season was shambolic for the Reds, who finished 15th and put in a lacklustre performance in their Europa League final defeat by Tottenham.",
      "While Amorim has mainly focused on bolstering his frontline with the acquisitions of Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko, Maguire looks set to play an important role in the Portuguese boss's defence. He will be contending with Leny Yoro, Matthijs de Ligt, Lisandro Martinez and Noussair Mazraoui for a place in Amorim's three-man backline.",

The bomb squad group, which previously also included Marcus Rashford before he left for Barcelona, have been told they have no future under Ruben Amorim and are looking for new clubs.",
      "Sancho spent last season on loan with Chelsea, but they turned down the opportunity to sign him permanently, deciding they would rather stump up a Â£5million fee than pay Â£25m for his services. He has since agreed terms with Fenerbahce and Juventus, only for those deals to fall at the last hurdle.",
      "The 25-year-old has less than a year left on his contract with United, but his Â£300,000 wages are providing a stumbling block towards any exit. Borussia Dortmund and Roma have both shown an interest, yet it is Besiktas who could jump to the front of the queue after club president Serdal Adali spoke out.",
      "âJust as much as the community wants him, I want him too,â he told Turkiye Today. âWhat matters is not only our desire, but also if the player wants to come to Turkey. We have a budget, and we will do our best to bring him here.",
      "âPlayers like Jadon Sancho usually prefer clubs playing in the Champions League. Whether it happens today or not, it is hard to say. If it is possible, we will get him. Besiktas fans can rest assured.â",
      "Besiktasâ fans are extremely keen to sign Sancho, having bombarded his Instagram account with over five million messages reading âCome to Besiktasâ.",
      "However, Fabrizio Romano has reported that Sancho does not share the enthusiasm of the Besiktas fanbase and isnât keen on a move to Turkey at this stage of his career. Instead, he is planning to wait for interest in Italy to turn into an offer.",
      "But despite Gian Piero Gasperiniâs interest in Sancho, Roma reportedly donât have the funds available to pay his wages. Roma would need to move on some of their unwanted players first, but Inter Milan have also been mooted as suitors in Italian reports.",
      "Besiktas are managed by Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, who was in charge of United when Sancho was signed for Â£73m from Dortmund back in 2021 The move did not work out, with Sancho returning just 12 goals and six assists in 83 matches for the club. Sancho did better on loan with Chelsea, with five goals and 10 assists in 41 games last season.",

      "Manchester United's failure to sign West Ham star Jean-Clair Tobido 12 months ago could hold the key to Marcus Rashford finally being registered by Barcelona. Rashford, 27, joined Barca last month on a season-long loan but the England international still isn't officially part of Hansi Flick's squad for La Liga matches.",
      "That's alongside fellow new signings Joan Garcia and Roony Bardghji as well as Wojciech Szczesny and Gerard Martin. This is due to Barcelona still having issues registering new players within La Liga's salary cap.",
      "With just three days to go until Barca begin their league campaign away to Mallorca, they've got a race against the clock. But Tobido's permanent move to West Ham has been boost.",
      "The French defender spent last season with the Premier League club on loan from French side Nice before a deal worth â¬40million (Â£34m) was completed this July. Thanks to inserting a sell-on clause when they sold him to Nice, Barcelona recouped â¬8m (Â£6.9m).",
      "That was a handy injection of cash for the La Liga champions, who could earn a further sum through the sale of Real Betis winger Ez Abde. Barca have a sell-on clause which, if Roma pay the reported â¬20m (Â£17.2m), would see them bank â¬4m (Â£3.4m).",
      "Todibo's journey, however, could've been very different. United were interested in signing the 25-year-old last summer, only for UEFA to block the transfer.",
      "That was because Red Devils co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe also owns a majority stake in Nice and due to both teams being in the 2024-25 Europa League, Ratcliffe had to place the Ligue 1 outfit into a blind trust to avoid flouting UEFA's multi-club ownership rules.",
      "European football's governing body also prevented the two clubs from trading players, infuriating Ratcliffe. During an interview with Bloomberg, the INEOS chairman hit out at UEFA chiefs and referenced indirectly Todibo's situation.",
      "Will Marcus Rashford be a success at Barcelona? Give us your prediction in the comments section.",
      "\"They've said we can sell him to another Premiership club, but we can't sell to Manchester United,\" Ratcliffe told Bloomberg. \"But that's not fair on the player and I don't see what that achieves.\"",
      "Back at Barcelona, club president Joan Laporta is confident that Rashford and his four team-mates will be registered in time. \"It's progressing well,\" Laporta said earlier this month. \"We're doing our job and we're confident that we'll be able to register everyone.\"",
      "Rashford added: \"It's something for the club to sort out. I believe they are going to get it sorted. I just focus on training and be ready for the start of the season.\"",

      "Able to play at left-back or in the centre of defence, the former Sporting Lisbon man was a handy option under several managers but was never a long-term starter and saw his United career blighted by injuries. Rojo joined Boca Juniors upon his departure from Old Trafford, spending four controversy-laden years with the Argentine giants before his contract was terminated last week.",
      "Now the 35-year-old has signed for Racing Club - but there's a catch. The club's bitter rivals, Independiente, are nicknamed 'El Rojo' which translates to 'The Reds'.",
      "In order to avoid promoting their rivals, Racing Club chiefs asked Rojo to drop his surname from the back of his No.6 shirt. It simply reads 'Marcos R.' instead.",
      "Rojo will feel much more welcome at Racing Club compared to his final weeks with Boca. He didn't make a single appearance under new manager Miguel Angel Russo, who was appointed in June, and was ultimately banned from the dressing room.",
      "A statement confirming his exit read: \"Club Atletico Boca Juniors informs that the player Marcos Rojo has signed the termination of his contract. That was the contract that linked him to the Institution.",

      "Marcus Rashford has said that ex-Manchester United boss Jose Mourinho helped him to become less \"angry all the time\". Rashford, 27, claimed he would berate himself at The Red Devils if he didn't play the perfect game, win or lose.",
      "The Portuguese icon didn't care how his team won however - and that easy-going style had a huge effect on the England forward. Rashford, now on a season-long loan at Barcelona, was speaking to Gary Lineker and Micah Richards on The Rest is Football podcast.",
      "Asked by Lineker which coaches at United had the biggest influence on him, Rashford name-checked Louis Van Gaal, Mourinho and Ole Gunnar Solskjaer. Rashford delved into what made all three different and how it was Mourinho, who managed the club from 2016 to 2018, and his unique approach that surprised him the most.",
      "\"Yeah, they're [all three coaches] different, but [that's] because we've had so many different managers,\" Rashford said, referring to the ten managers United have had since 2013.",
      "\"It's so hard, It's impossible for me to compare the managers, but when you're a developing player, like at a young age, you learn stuff that you've never... no one's ever taught you that before.",
      "\"So like up until Jose, I'd never had a manager that was so fixated on winning before Jose. Van Gaal wasn't fixated on winning... he was fixated on winning, but he wanted to play a beautiful style of football. Jose don't care. Do you know what I mean?",
      "\"As long as you win, of course, if you could choose, he'd want you to play well. But if you win, you win. You move on to the next game.\"",
      "Adding how Mourinho's approach was a refreshing change for him, he said: \"He [Mourinho] had this attitude. In the beginning, it was confusing for me because all the way through my development at United, it was about playing a certain style of, like winning a certain way. So in the beginning, I was angry all the time, like we've not played well today, we've won.",
      "\"But because we've won and he's a manager that is just a winner, he doesn't bring up the points that you know was missing from that last game because we've won. But when we lose, he brings up the points then. But after like six months, I just learned to respect it and then I started to reap the rewards from him as a coach.\"",
      "After months of speculation Rashford finally departed United, the club he joined at just seven years old, for Aston Villa at the turn of the year. However, after scoring four goals under Unai Emery he elected to join the Spanish giants this summer.",
      "United boss Ruben Amorim is now overseeing yet another new era at Old Trafford. United finished 15th last season and lost the Europa League Final to Tottenham Hotspur and asked to pinpoint what's gone wrong at his parent club, Rashford believes the Red Devils have abandoned the \"principles\" instilled by their former legendary manager Sir Alex Ferguson.",
      "\"When Ferguson was in charge, not only were there principles for the first team but they were for the whole academy,\" he said.",
      "\"'So you could pick players from 15 years and they'd all understand the principles of playing the Manchester United way. Any team that has been successful over a period of time has principles that mean that any coach or player that comes in has to align to or add to the principles.",

      "Former Tottenham manager Ange Postecoglou brutally dubbed Benjamin Sesko \"smart\" for rejecting Arsenal last year. The Gunners had been pursuing Manchester United's new signing for some time before opting to go in a different direction.",
      "Mikel Arteta's search for a striker concluded this summer with the Â£64million acquisition of Viktor Gyokeres from Sporting CP. However, several targets, including Aston Villa's Ollie Watkins and Sesko, had been considered before settling on Gyokeres, who himself turned down interest from United.",
      "The 22-year-old Sesko will now spearhead Ruben Amorim's attack for the forthcoming Premier League season. Last year, during the Euros, Postecoglou commented on the marksman ahead of Slovenia's group stage match against England, offering an insightful and rather comical perspective on the failed Arsenal move.",
      "\"I think a big club would have looked at him this year, and it's a smart move for him to stay there for another year,\" Postecoglou said while providing analysis for ITV during Euro 2024.",
      "\"I think there's still some development in him, but really good attributes for a striker position, for sure,\" he added, referring to the forward who had just signed a new contract with RB Leipzig to ward off potential suitors.",
      "ITV presenter Mark Pougatch then asked the Australian: \"Is that the Tottenham manager saying it's a smart move not to go to Arsenal?\"",
      "Postecoglou delivered a cheeky response as he declared: \"No comment.\" This sparked laughter from everyone in the ITV studio, including Gary Neville, Ian Wright and Roy Keane.",
      "Reports emerged last summer that Arsenal were poised to trigger Sesko's Â£55m release clause, but their interest quickly faded after the striker signed his fresh contract, reports Football London.",
      "Similar rumours surfaced again in January and during this summer's transfer window, but with a higher price tag attached, their chase swiftly ended, and Gyokeres was secured instead.",
      "The Red Devils then pounced to land themselves a striker, confirming Sesko's arrival in a deal worth Â£74m on Saturday and presenting him to supporters ahead of a pre-season clash with Fiorentina.",
      "Sesko was delighted when questioned about why he chose United over other potential destinations, including Arsenal and Newcastle United, who tabled a more generous offer for him this summer.",
      "\"The history of Manchester United is obviously very special but what really excites me is the future,\" declared Sesko. \"When we discussed the project, it was clear that everything is in place for this team to continue to grow and compete for the biggest trophies again soon.",
      "\"From the moment that I arrived, I could feel the positive energy and family environment that the club has created. It is clearly the perfect place to reach my maximum level and fulfil all of my ambitions.",

      "Marcus Rashford believes Manchester United have found themselves \"in no man's land\" after chopping and changing manager several times in recent years. Ruben Amorim is now at the helm, and the Portuguese is gearing up for his first full season in charge.",
      "That season will begin without Rashford at Old Trafford. The England international has moved to Barcelona on loan, and could end up in Catalunya permanently if things go well. While his own focus is on the task at hand in La Liga, he has lamented the changes at Old Trafford which have brought United to this point.",
      "âPeople say that weâve been in a transition for years but to be in a transition you have to start it. The actual transition hasnât started yet,\" Rashford told The Rest is Football Podcast. âWhen Liverpool went through this, they got [Jurgen] Klopp and stuck with him. They didnât win in the beginning. People only remember his final few years when he was competing with [Manchester] City and winning the biggest trophies.",
      "âTo start a transition you have to make a plan and stick to it. This is where I speak about being realistic about what your situation is. Weâve had that many different managers, ideas and strategies in order to win that you end up in no manâs land.â",
      "Liverpool reached the Europa League final in Klopp's first season, losing to Sevilla. United did the same in Amorim's first campaign, but it remains to be seen whether the club are as patient as their rivals.",
      "Klopp had been for Anfield for more than two-and-a-half years before reaching the Champions League final, and three-and-a-half before winning a trophy. Since Sir Alex Ferguson left Old Trafford in 2013, no manager has lasted three years in the role there.",
      "\"Show me a successful team that just adapts,\" Rashford said, reflecting on the Ferguson era and what has followed. \"When Fergie was in charge, not only the principles for the first team â the whole academy set up so you could pick players from 15 years and over â thatâs a full generation. And theyâd all understand the principles of playing the Man United way, right?",
      "\"You see it with any team thatâs been successful over a period of time â they have principles that any coach that comes in, any player that comes in, has to align to these principles or be able to add to these principles.",
      "\"Whereas at times I feel like United have just beenâ¦ weâre hungry to win, so weâll always try to adapt and to sign players that fit this system. But itâs reactionary.\"",
      "Certainly, signing players to fit a manager's system is what United have done this summer too, as they prepare to kick off the new season against Arsenal on Sunday.",
      "Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo have both been signed to operate as the twin No.10s in the 3-4-2-1 formation to which Amorim is wedded, while Â£74m has been splashed out on Benjamin Sesko to be the club's new No.9. Combined it is a Â£200m outlay to give Amorim the attack he wants after muddling through last term with misfiring pair Rasmus Hojlund and Joshua Zirkzee sharing striking duties.",
      "With Diego Leon adding defensive depth and the potential for more additions before the window closes, Amorim believes a selection headache can only be a good thing.",
      "\"It is supposed to be like that, not like last season that we have to struggle to put 11 players on the pitch,\" he said after Saturday's friendly against Fiorentina. \"This is the normal thing so I need to think and they [the players] need to fight during the week, so they can change my mind, I have an idea but they will change my mind during the week.",
      "\"It is going to be tough because we try to arrange a full week of training, so we will have two really strong sessions with time to work and then we are going to break a little bit and then two days to really think about the strategy for the game and we will be ready.â",

      "Hojlund started just two of United's five pre-season friendlies and watched attacking-midfielders Cunha and Mason Mount lead the line in his absence against Everton and Fiorentina. That was almost certainly Ruben Amorim's way of telling him he doesn't feature in his plans.",

      "\"This club is built on the academy and we've got Chido Obi sitting there. Play him if you just need someone for a few games rather than someone who's older and can't stay fit.\"",
      "Not only is Ferdinand right that United should steer clear of Calvert-Lewin, who scored just three Premier League goals last season, but he is also right that the club should prioritise the development of Chido Obi.",
      "Of course, the Danish youth international is only 17 and is still learning his trade, but he has an enormous amount of potential United should be trying to unleash instead of signing a 28-year-old that has scored just 17 Premier League goals in the last four seasons.",
      "Calvert-Lewin has only made it into double figures twice in the Premier League in his career, last doing so in 2020/21, scoring 16 goals under the stewardship of Carlo Ancelotti.",
      "Sesko will be their main man at the tip United's attack this season and Obi will be hungry to be the support act, providing competition and help from the bench. He made eight appearances last season and will only get better the more game time he earns.",
      "United's history is built on promoting from within and their academy has been a consistent beacon of light throughout the recent struggles at first-team level. Obi has demonstrated he is an instinctive striker, possessing traits that cannot always be taught on the training ground.",
      "United supporters love nothing more than seeing an academy graduate make their mark in the first-team and there is every chance Obi will be able to do that in good time.",
      "Additionally, with no European football to come this season, United do not have as many fixtures to look forward to, meaning rotation will not be as heavy as in previous seasons. That could allow Obi to be eased in slower, helping him and United in the process.",
      "Obi is a much more appealing option than Calvert-Lewin as a secondary striker right now.",
      "Manchester United have unveiled their new third kit for the 2025/26 season.",

      "The countdown to the start of the new Premier League season is almost over.",
      "Less than 48 hours after Liverpool and Bournemouth open the 2025/26 campaign at Anfield on Friday night, Manchester United and Arsenal will take centre stage at Old Trafford on Sunday afternoon.",
      "The visit of the Londoners will mark the beginning of Ruben Amorim's first full season as United head coach, and there is an upbeat mood surrounding the club heading into their season opener.",
      "A successful summer transfer window, which has seen four new arrivals, and a positive pre-season campaign means United supporters will be arriving at Old Trafford on confident last season's woes will be banished.",
      "But what could Amorim's matchday squad for the season opener look like?",
      "If Onana wins his fitness battle and gets the green light to start, it will be interesting to see the landscape of the back three he is tasked with marshalling. Leny Yoro is a guaranteed starter after starting four of United's five friendlies, but there is less certainty about who will join him in defence.",
      "Matthijs de Ligt and Harry Maguire are competing to start in the middle of the back three and Ayden Heaven is rivalling Luke Shaw to start as the left-sided centre-back.",
      "All four players will believe they are worthy of starting berths, leaving Amorim with a selection dilemma to solve. There is no obvious answer, but De Ligt and Shaw could get the nod after making three starts each during the summer.",
      "Amad and Patrick Dorgu are shoo-ins to occupy the two wing-back positions. The latter came on in leaps and bounds during pre-season, particularly during the tour of the United States, while Amad started all five warm up matches.",
      "Bruno Fernandes is set to occupy one of the two midfield positions. The United captain has regularly flexed his muscles in the engine room and is a guaranteed starter.",
      "However, there is an ongoing debate about who should partner the Portuguese international. Manuel Ugarte, Kobbie Mainoo and Casemiro are the contenders and they all got opportunities to prove their worth during pre-season.",
      "In an ideal world, United will bring in a new midfielder before the transfer window slams shut, but that mission is unlikely to be fulfilled ahead of Sunday's game. It means Ugarte, amid his defensive profile, is the most logical partner for Fernandes.",
      "Mainoo will believe he is worthy of a starting berth, but he is a forward-thinking player, meaning the prospect of him partnering Fernandes in the centre of midfield would risk leaving United vulnerable to opposition attacks.",
      "Cunha, who scored 17 goals for Wolves last season, should start as the left-sided No.10. Bryan Mbeumo is the obvious pick to fill the other No.10 spot.",
      "Despite only featuring twice in pre-season due to a lack of match sharpness, Mbeumo impressed against both Everton and Fiorentina. He linked up really well with Amad and should be awarded his competitive debut for United from the start.",
      "Supported by Cunha and Mbeumo, Benjamin Sesko should come straight into the team and lead the attack. He arrived from RB Leipzig last weekend to provide the final piece in the attacking jigsaw.",
      "As far as the bench is concerned, Amorim has a competitive squad at his disposal, meaning he will have options to turn to. Tom Heaton had a better pre-season than Altay Bayindir and should be promoted to second-choice in the pecking order.",
      "Defensive cover can come from Diogo Dalot, Maguire and Heaven. Mainoo and Casemiro can offer midfield cover and Mason Mount will be able to offer support to Cunha and Mbeumo in the No.10 position.",
      "Unless an exit materialises beforehand, Hojlund should make the bench. Chido Obi should also make the matchday squad against his former club.",
      "United starting XI: Onana; Yoro, De Ligt, Shaw; Amad, Ugarte, Fernandes, Dorgu; Mbeumo, Cunha; Sesko.",
      "United substitutes: Heaton, Dalot, Maguire, Heaven, Mainoo, Casemiro, Mount, Hojlund, Obi.",

      "Hello and welcome to your dedicated Manchester United transfers blog on Wednesday, August 13.",
      "Heading into the final few weeks of the summer transfer window, United remain active and open to pursuing new opportunities. One of the latest names linked is Carlos Baleba of Brighton & Hove Albion.",
      "The young midfielder is considered one of the most highly rated prospects in European football, with a sky-high ceiling. So far, the club have added Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo, Diego Leon and Benjamin Sesko to their ranks.",
      "Ruben Amorimâs side wrapped up their pre-season campaign over the weekend with a 1-1 draw against Fiorentina at Old Trafford, going on to win the match in a penalty shootout. Now, the focus shifts to the start of the Premier League season and Sunday afternoon's clash with Arsenal.",
      "However, despite the significant investment in three high-profile attacking signings, further business could still be on the cards - provided United are able to sanction one or two departures. As for potential outgoings, Tyrell Malacia, Antony, Jadon Sancho, and Alejandro Garnacho are all effectively available for transfer.",
      "Catch up with the latest news, views and Manchester United transfer rumours below.",
      "Manchester United's blockbuster signing of Slovenian striker Benjamin Sesko has reportedly caused frustration not only among their Premier League rivals, but also clubs abroad.",
      "It represented a major coup for the Manchester club, as the 22-year-old was also a top target for Newcastle United, who are desperately searching for a potential replacement for Alexander Isak. But it seems the Magpies were not the only club on the continent eyeing a move for the striker.",
      "According to Spanish outlet SPORT, Barcelona in particular have been left âhurtâ by Seskoâs recent switch to Old Trafford. Sporting director Deco is said to rate the player highly and was considering him as a long-term successor to Robert Lewandowski.",
      "Following on from reports that a deal for Brighton's Carlos Baleba is not imminent, that has now been backed up by a report from The Telegraph.",
      "The article notes that Manchester United are currently unwilling to buy at the Seagulls' asking price of more than Â£100 million and the clubs have not yet spoken directly.",
      "While the 21-year-old is the midfielder the United hierarchy would like to sign, they are still operating within tight profit and sustainability lines.",
      "Instead, they decided to put their resources into strengthening the forward line, most recently with the addition of Benjamin Sesko from RB Leipzig.",
      "Brighton are set to remain firm on their stance that Manchester United target Carlos Baleba is not available this summer, according to reports.",
      "TBR Football claim United, through intermediaries, are continuing to discuss a move with Brighton but the signals are not positive. The report adds that while the player is certainly open to a switch to Old Trafford, he is not actively pushing the move at this stage.",
      "The notion that it would take Moises Caicedo money - in excess of Â£100m - has once again been reiterated. Brighton would have to consider an offer in that range, but it has been claimed the Seagulls are not anticipating that sort of a bid from United.",
      "Manchester United have confirmed youngster Jack Fletcher is training with the first-team ahead of Sunday's Premier League opener against Arsenal at Old Trafford, writes George Smith.",
      "Fletcher, who is the son of former United midfielder and now-Under-18s boss Darren, is one of the most highly-rated players emerging from the club's academy.",
      "The midfielder recently went on the club's pre-season tour of the United States and came off the bench in the second half of the 2-1 win over West Ham United at the MetLife Stadium in New Jersey.",
      "Read the story here.",
      "Marcus Rashford has spoken publicly, and openly, for the first time since joining Barcelona in a sitdown interview with Gary Lineker and Micah Richards, writes Stephen Killen.",
      "MEN Sport has taken a look at some of the biggest talking points from the 43-minute chat between the two pundits and the United loanee.",
      "Read the story here.",
      "Serie A giants AC Milan are stepping up their pursuit of Manchester United striker Rasmus Hojlund, according to the latest reports.",
      "CaughtOffside claim a potential deal to bring the Dane to the San Siro is gaining momentum, which could be worth in the region of â¬40-â¬45 million in the form of a loan with an option to buy.",
      "The article adds that Milan are now in direct contact with Hojlund's agent in order to reach an agreement, but they are also keeping tabs on Dusan Vlahovic's situation at Juventus as a potential alternative.",
      "Man United are seemingly already preparing for the future, with scouts reportedly looking at a potential striker signing.",
      "The Daily Mail have reported that United are showing an interest in Internacional striker Ricardo Mathias. The 19-year-old has scored five goals across 18 appearances for Internacional and is already attracting interest from the Premier League. The report claims that United have sent scouts to watch Mathias in action, most recently last week for a 1-1 draw with Fluminense.",
      "Mathias is reported to have a Â£56.2million release clause in his contract with Internacional, with United said to be keen to put themselves at the top of the list of clubs interested in his signature. After the signing of Sesko, United now have four recognised centre forwards in the first team alongside Rasmus Hojlund, Joshua Zirkzee and Chido Obi. Hojlund, though, is being heavily linked with a move away from United, with AC Milan a potential destination.",
      "United have already ventured to South America for one new signing this summer, with Diego Leon arriving from Cerro Porteno in Paraguay. United agreed to pay a Â£3.3million initial fee with the potential for the deal to reach up to Â£7million.",
      "Man United can help Carlos Baleba to achieve what he has set out to do in his football career.",
      "The youngster is a versatile midfielder capable of contributing across the pitch and on paper at least, appears to be exactly the type of player Ruben Amorimâs team need. Baleba is about to embark on just his third season in the Premier League but his ambitions are clear - and United may feel they can help him achieve them.",
      "When asked if that was achievable on the south coast, the midfielder added: \"For me, there are opportunities everywhere. I can win trophies here with Brighton, I can win trophies at another club. My ambition is to just win trophies everywhere I go. Just doing that and making the world happy.\"",
      "On Tuesday, journalist Fabrizio Romano reported that talks with Brighton are ongoing as United try to understand the Seagulls' asking price. He added that they are not pursuing other targets as things stand, even though Brighton reportedly have 'no intention' of lowering their asking price of over Â£100million.",
      "Teddy Sheringham believes Sanchoâs chances of joining another âbig clubâ are slim after his recent struggles.",
      "\"Jadon Sancho will definitely not play for a big club again,\" the former United striker told Snabbare. \"He might say he can and will, but I donât see it that way. I think heâs burned his bridges with the manager and doesnât even have a place in the dressing room.",
      "\"Maybe if he were given another chance, he could adapt to what Amorim wants. But from my experience, once youâve gone down the path of being unhappy and wanting out, itâs very hard to turn things around -with the manager, the fans, and the other players.",
      "\"You have to show incredible mental strength to change that. Itâs possible, and I know heâs talented, but Iâd be very surprised if it happens now.\"",
      "Betis centre-back Natan has claimed winger Antony is 'waiting' to seal a return to the Spanish club.",
      "It is expected Antony's only hope of rejoining the La Liga outfit is via a season-long loan deal. Now, fellow Brazilian Natan has hinted the United winger is expecting to return to the club.",
      "\"Hopefully he can come back and be with us for another year or two,\" Natan told El Chiringuito, as quoted by Football Espana. \"Yes, he's waiting and we're all waiting.",
      "\"I think it's not just me, all the Betis. I hope he comes. Let's hope, I have hope.\"",
      "The Athletic's David Ornstein claims Leeds United have reached an agreement in principle to sign Calvert-Lewin amid links to Man United.",
      "The 28-year-old became a free agent after his Everton contract expired in June. A medical for the striker at Leeds' training ground, Thorp Arch, is said to be scheduled 'imminently.'",
      "Marcus Rashford believes Man United have never properly adapted after Sir Alex Ferguson's retirement in 2013.",
      "Speaking to Gary Lineker and Micah Richards on The Rest Is Football podcast, Rashford said: \"At times I feel like United has beenâ¦ weâre hungry to win, so we will always try to adapt and sign players that fit this system, but itâs reactionary.",
      "\"If your directions are always changing, you canât expect to win the league. You might win some cup tournaments, but itâs because you have a good coach, good players and you have match winners in your team, youâre not there by accident. This is what some people forget.",
      "\"Yeah we have been way lower than what people deem United to be, but if you take a step back, which Iâve been able to do, especially over the last six months, what do you expect? People say we have been in a transition for years. To be in a transition you need to start a transition. Itâs like the actual transition has not started yet.\"",
      "Referencing the early struggles Jurgen Klopp endured as Liverpool manager, Rashford added: \"When Liverpool went through this with Klopp, they stuck with him. They didnât win anything in the beginning. People only remember his final few years when he was competing with City and winning the biggest trophies, they did not win anything at the beginning. To start a transition, you have to make a plan and stick to it.",
      "\"This is where I want to speak about being realistic with what your situation is. I feel like weâve had that many different managers and different ideas and different strategies in order to win, you end up in the middle of them, you end up in no man's land.\"",
      "Manchester City have not denied interest in Paris Saint-Germain goalkeeper Donnarumma - but their preference is to keep Ederson.",
      "The Brazilian has been No.1 at the club for the past eight years and the intention is to make that nine. Tuesday saw an avalanche of media reports though regarding both Ederson and Donnarumma. There have been claims that Galatasaray are closing in on a deal for the former while City have agreed terms with the latter, whose time at PSG is over.",
      "A move for Donnarumma looks certain if Ederson leaves, and City will reluctantly let him leave if they get the right offer - just as they will Savinho amid Tottenham interest. However, club sources say that there is currently nothing on the table for Ederson from other clubs and they would like to keep it that way.",
      "The speculation adds to the uncertainty around City heading into the new season. Pep Guardiola said last week that he was not expecting any new arrivals in the remaining weeks of the transfer window, but City would be forced into action by movement around Ederson.",
      "More here.",
      "With just under three weeks of the summer transfer window remaining Man United face a race against time to get their shopping done.",
      "Having failed to qualify for any form of European football this season, concerns were raised about whether United would find it difficult to attract players who would not look out of place in the Champions League. However, just as head coach Ruben Amorim stated back in April, United will always appeal to players.",
      "He said: \"It's Manchester United. What I feel is that there's a lot of players that want to play for our club. I know that if you look at our club at the moment it looks like sometimes with all the problems with the staff, people going, changing coach, the results, it looks like a little bit of a problem at the moment. But we have a clear idea. \"That is the easiest part to explain to a player. And then it's Manchester United. Everybody wants to play for Manchester United.\"",
      "United remain keen to strengthen their midfield options ahead of the window closing and Baleba is on their radar. He is one of European football's most highly-rated midfielders and his ceiling is sky-high. Like Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko, he would not look out of place in a team playing Champions League football this season.",
      "He can do a little bit of everything in midfield and his skillset is very attractive. With United's midfield in desperate need of fresh blood, the club's hierarchy will be hoping Baleba is the latest player to prove Amorim right and be attracted to the prospect of representing the Reds.",
      "Read more here.",
      "Spanish outlet Fichajes report Man United have submitted an offer of around â¬80million (Â£69m) for Lopez. The bid is said to be hard for the Catalan club to ignore.",
      "Barca, who are dealing with ongoing financial challenges, recognise the viability of the offer and its potential benefits for the transfer.",
      "Last week, Lopez was asked about the transfer speculation, saying: \"I want to stay here - itâs my dream, and I will stay. Iâm happy to help the team.",
      "\"A lot has been said, but Iâm going to keep defending these colors and working harder than anyone. The fans can relax.\"",
      "Real Betis sporting director Manu Fajardo has confirmed the Spanish club is not giving up on re-signing Man United winger Antony before the end of this summer's transfer window.",
      "Antony is expected to leave the club ahead of the window closing on September 1. Betis have maintained interest in the Brazilian throughout the summer after signing him on loan back in January for the second half of the 2024/25 campaign. He excelled in Spain, scoring nine goals and registering five assists in just 26 games.",
      "\"Both parties want him to be here this season,\" said Fajardo, as quoted by AS. \"Every day that passes allows us to dream of him being here.",
      "\"If Antony is here, it's because the numbers add up. The most important thing is the club's sustainability; we can't do anything crazy. It's okay to think big, but you also have to keep your feet on the ground.",
      "\"If he doesn't sign with a club, there are still options, but the deal would take place within the parameters we have budgeted at the club.\"",
      "United need to sell the Brazilian for Â£32.58million this summer to avoid a loss under the profit and sustainability rules (PSR). He has two years left on his deal at Old Trafford.",
      "Hull City are reportedly hopeful of securing a season-long loan deal for Toby Collyer.",
      "According to our colleagues at Hull Live, Hull view Toby Collyer as a player with significant potential and see him as a strong candidate for the number six role.",
      "The Tigers are believed to have been in talks with Man United for several weeks and are confident theyâre leading the race to sign the 21-year-old, ahead of other Championship sides - including Yorkshire rivals Sheffield Wednesday.",
      "They are said to be 'quietly confident' of completing a deal for Collyer ahead of Oxford United's visit to the MKM Stadium on Sunday, although the move is not yet finalised. The club is also still awaiting the outcome of their appeal against a three-window fee restriction ban.",
      "Sancho has turned down a transfer offer to leave Man United.",
      "The winger, who has reportedly held talks with several Serie A clubs, is said to have received another offer this week from Turkish side Besiktas.",
      "Besiktas president Serdal Adali said: \"Just as much as the community wants him, I want him too. What matters is not only our desire, but also if the player wants to come to Turkey. We have a budget, and we will do our best to bring him here.",
      "\"Players like Jadon Sancho usually prefer clubs playing in the Champions League. Whether it happens today or not, it is hard to say. If it is possible, we will get him. Besiktas fans can rest assured.\"",
      "However, Fabrizio Romano reports that Sancho has rejected the chance to reunite with former United manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer in Turkey.",
      "The 25-year-old is believed to be holding out for a move to Italy and has therefore turned down Besiktasâ advances. That stance, however, could change if he is still searching for a new club as the transfer deadline approaches.",
      "Man United have reportedly held talks to sign Dominic Calvert-Lewin following the expiration of his contract at Everton at the end of June.",
      "According to talkSPORT, Calvert-Lewin has parted ways with his agent as he continues his search for a new club, and he has signaled openness to a potential move to United.",
      "In addition to discussions with the Reds, Newcastle United and Leeds United are also said to have engaged in talks regarding a possible transfer. Meanwhile, Sunderland recently made an ambitious attempt to secure the English striker's signature.",
      "According to Fabrizio Romano, contact with Brighton for the midfielder has continued from Manchester United's side.",
      "Speaking on his YouTube channel last night, he said: \"Contacts continue for Carlos Baleba. Today, Man United spoke again to the agents of the player. They are prepared to try to understand how much Brighton want.",
      "\"So this week, I expect Manchester United to try to understand the situation directly with Brighton, and letâs see whatâs going to happen there. But Baleba remains a topic at United. They are still not moving on another midfielder, and it means that United maintain the contacts active for Baleba and also try to understand if they can really make it happen or if itâs going to be impossible because Brighton still have no intention to reduce their price tag.\"",
      "Give Me Sport report that Man United are keeping an eye on England international, Kane.",
      "The 32-year-old, who joined Bayern Munich from Tottenham Hotspur in 2023, has a release clause in his contract which will come into play in January 2026 and could see him leave the Bundesliga champions for as little as Â£56million.",
      "Manchester City have reportedly agreed personal terms with Paris Saint-Germain goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma over a move to the Etihad.",
      "The 26-year-old Italy international has been linked with a move to the Premier League after he was deemed surplus to requirements at the Parc des Princes under Luis Enrique. United were one of the Premier League clubs most frequently linked with a move for Donnarumma, though it seems that bitter rivals City are now looking to strike a move for the shot-stopper.",
      "French publication L'Equipe claims that Donnarumma had been in talks with both United and City but it is the latter who have reached an agreement on personal terms with the former AC Milan prodigy.",
      "We'll be keeping you updated throughout the day with the latest United news, as there are now less than three weeks until the summer transfer window closes. The countdown is also on for the Reds' Premier League opener against Arsenal!",
      "So, grab yourself a brew - let's get started, shall we?",
      "Join us tomorrow for all the latest Manchester United transfer news and rumours.",
      "See you then!",
      "Paris Saint-Germain goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma, who has been linked with a move to Manchester United this summer, has issued a statement on his future after being left out of Luis Enriqueâs squad for the UEFA Super Cup final against Tottenham on Wednesday.",
      "The Italy international has one year remaining on his contract at the Parc des Princes and has been tipped to leave the club this summer.",
      "Donnarummaâs future in the French capital appears untenable, and his recent statement reads like a farewell to the club and its supporters, strongly suggesting that the decision to leave may not have been his own.",
      "Read what he had to say here.",
      "Manchester United remain confident of selling Rasmus Hojlund before the summer transfer window closes, writes James Quinlan.",
      "A hint to what life could be like at Old Trafford for Hojlund following those three signings came last Saturday too, when he was an unused substitute in 1-1 friendly draw with Fiorentina.",
      "The club have already judged around Â£30m to be a fair market value for a striker who last season scored only four Premier League goals in 32 outings.",
      "However, the CIES Football Observatory has freshly updated its estimated transfer values and would suggest United are severely underestimating themselves and their Danish international.",
      "Read the story here.",
      "David de Gea had a heartwarming interaction with Bruno Fernandes' children after Manchester United's pre-season friendly against Fiorentina over the weekend, writes Keifer MacDonald.",
      "The Reds drew 1-1 with the Serie A outfit at Old Trafford on Saturday afternoon after Simon Sohm's eighth-minute opener was cancelled out by a Robin Gosens own-goal.",
      "For De Gea, it was his first return to Old Trafford since he left United at the end of his contract in May 2023. The Spaniard spent 12 seasons with the Red Devils, making 545 appearances.",
      "Read the story here.",
      "Manchester United are not actively pursuing Paris Saint-Germain outcast Gianluigi Donnarumma, according to reports.",
      "The goalkeeper has one year remaining on his deal at the Parc des Princes and could depart for a reduced fee this summer. He has not been included in Luis Enrique's squad for their UEFA Super Cup meeting with Tottenham on Wednesday night amid ongoing speculation over his future.",
      "The Italian has been linked with a switch to the Premier League, although the Daily Mail claim United have shut down any suggestions he is a target for Ruben Amorim's side.",
      "Donnarumma is not a target and goalkeeper is not a priority position for the club this summer.",
      "Manchester United midfielder Toby Collyer is in talks over a loan move to Championship side Hull City, according to the Daily Mail.",
      "The article claims initial talks have been held over a season-long loan for the 21-year-old, with the Tigers having a strong track record of devloping young talent.",
      "It has been suggested talks are at an early stage and there remains some competition from Sheffield Wednesday, but the midfielder is open to a loan switch ahead of the new campaign.",
      "Garnacho joining Chelsea on a permanent deal could help Man United fund a swoop for Baleba and, also, hand the midfielder a dream welcome gift.",
      "Baleba appears to be open to an Old Trafford switch, but it seems very likely available (or unavailable) finances will be what prevents a would-be deal. Elsewhere, United are said to want Â£50million to sell Garnacho, but Chelsea are not currently keen on hitting that figure.",
      "If a compromise is reached on a fee, it seems almost guaranteed that United will put those funds towards signing Baleba. If that scenario does play out, United's latest arrival could be left the perfect welcome gift by the departing Garnacho. That is because both players wore the No.17 shirt last season and Garnacho moving on would leave that free for Baleba to take.",
      "As potential alternatives, Baleba has also worn No.20 and No.35 but - after a few alterations - only the former is available at United. It certainly seems as though the No.17 would be his first-choice considering he changed to that squad number at the start of his second season at Brighton."

      "Former Manchester United captain Gary Neville believes the club must sign a new goalkeeper to launch a genuine top six push this season.",
      "United have been busy in the transfer window this summer, splashing out almost Â£200million on four new signings. They have prioritised additions in the attacking department, bringing in Matheus Cunha from Wolves, Bryan Mbeumo from Brentford and most recently Benjamin Sesko from RB Leipzig.",
      "United struggled for goals last season, finishing the Premier League campaign with a negative goal difference of -10, meaning they have rightfully prioritised strengthening at the top end of the pitch. Their other summer recruit is left-sided defender Diego Leon.",
      "After finishing 15th in the Premier League last season, United, for the first time since the 2014/15 campaign, will not compete in Europe this term, meaning full focus will be on domestic matters and attempting to secure European qualification for 2026/27.",
      "Securing a top-four finish and clinching Champions League qualification will be United's main ambition, but the strength of others targeting the same goal could mean United have to settle for a place in potentially the Europa League or the Europa Conference League.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "Despite being encouraged by the transfer business his former club has done so far this summer, Neville believes United must strengthen between the posts to give themselves the best possible chance to break into the top six.",
      "\"Can they embed themselves at United? Can they get the probably 35-40 goals which would be par for those three players?",
      "\"If they can get 40 goals, United's goals last season was terrible, they've got a good chance of getting into that top six, but they've got to settle those three players, and we can't take that for granted anymore at United.",

      "Alongside Tyrell Malacia, Alejandro Garnacho, Jadon Sancho and previously Marcus Rashford, who joined Barcelona on loan last month, Antony has been relegated to the 'bomb squad' and is expected to leave United before the transfer window shuts on September 1.",
      "Antony spent the second half of last season on loan at Betis, scoring nine goals and registering five assists in 26 appearances, and they are keen to re-sign him before the deadline. However, sporting director Manu Fajardo confirmed earlier this week they will only be able to sign him for a second time if a deal doesn't threaten their financial situation.",
      "It is expected Antony's only hope of rejoining the La Liga outfit is via a season-long loan deal. Now, fellow Brazilian Natan has hinted the United winger is expecting to return to the club.",

      "Taking up presenting duties are the trio of Mark Chapman, Gabby Logan and Kelly Cates, who will rotate between different shows alongside different combinations of pundits.",

      "Rashford likened it to Liverpool's situation at the beginning of Jurgen Klopp's tenure, where the Anfield club had to navigate tricky waters before tasting the fruits of their labour later down the line.",
      "It was evident that the recent years as a United player, and also a supporter, have greatly affected Rashford watching on from the side or failing to have a desire impact on the pitch.",

      "\"When Liverpool went through this with Klopp, they stuck with him, they didn't win in the beginning, people only remember his final few years when he was competing with Man City and winning things.",
      "\"To start a transition, you have to make a plan and stick to it, it's not easy to do. This is where I speak about being realistic about the situation, we've had that many different managers and different ideas, strategies in order to win, you end up in no man's land.\"",

      "Rather that being pinned to a certain position, the 27-year-old's comments fall into the conversation that many have had over where is best for the attacker - and it appears that his favoured position is on the left but his comments surrounding feeling left out when the action is elsewhere, highlights the challenges he faced at Old Trafford.",
      "Eventually, he became a square peg with Amorim preferring to implement a different system that deployed wingbacks with wide players utilised on the flanks or in Alejandro Garnacho's case, more central areas.",

When I'm at my best, I'm having that freedom to exploit the backline, from the left it's easy to do the rotation because I find it easy to play off the centre halves shoulder but football is never the same. Some games I'll be on the left, even if I'm having a good game, I see what's on the right and think I wish I was on there.\"",

      "One area of the pitch where Amorim is still facing a dilemma is between the sticks as he aims to bring in competition for current No.1 goalkeeper Andre Onana. The Cameroonian missed United's pre-season campaign because of a hamstring injury and committed several high profile mistakes last season.",
      "Paris Saint-Germain shot-stopper Gianluigi Donnarumma is one name who has been linked with a move to Old Trafford.",

      "A loan move for the Argentinian was reported earlier in the transfer window, and was said to have been rejected by Villa. Foster believes he could be the missing piece to help United achieve a top-five finish this season, which would now secure them Champions League football for the following campaign.",
      "Speaking on his Fozcast podcast, he said: \"United have got a better chance of doing it this year. I've loved United's transfer window. I think it's taken them and changed them from having another mid-table disappointment of a season to genuinely looking like competing alongside Newcastle and Villa.",
      "\"I think that if United get off to a good start, they can finish fifth this season. If they get another goalkeeper in, and if Emi Martinez has signed for Man United, they finish fifth this season.\"",

      "Villa are understood to have told United that it would take an exceptional offer of around Â£40million to sell their starting keeper.",
      "Last month, The Athletic reported that the club would not be continuing its pursuit of Martinez due to the asking price and significant wage demands.",
      "Meanwhile, ex-Arsenal defender Philippe Senderos thinks United should consider swooping for Inter Milan goalkeeper Yann Sommer.",
      "\"I think Yann Sommer is a very, very experienced player and a calming presence,\" Senderos told BoyleSports. \"He makes the defence better because of that presence.",
      "\"I can't really judge Andre Onana in this situation, but if United were to target Yann Sommer, I'd really believe he'd add invaluable experience.",
      "\"It's about how he is as a person, how he is on the pitch. He's a great character and amazing in what he brings to a defence. We've seen it with Inter Milan and Bayern Munich the year before.\"",

      "Manchester United can help Carlos Baleba to achieve what he has set out to do in his football career.",
      "Baleba has recently been identified as a target to reinforce United's midfield this summer. At just 21 years of age, the Cameroonian, who moved to Brighton from Lille two years ago, has already established himself as one of the Premier Leagueâs most highly-rated central players.",
      "The youngster is a versatile midfielder capable of contributing across the pitch and on paper at least, appears to be exactly the type of player Ruben Amorimâs team need.",
      "Baleba is about to embark on just his third season in the Premier League but his ambitions are clear - and United may feel they can help him achieve them.",
      "When asked if that was achievable on the south coast, the midfielder added: \"For me, there are opportunities everywhere. I can win trophies here with Brighton, I can win trophies at another club.",
      "\"My ambition is to just win trophies everywhere I go. Just doing that and making the world happy.\"",
      "On Tuesday, journalist Fabrizio Romano reported that talks with Brighton are ongoing as United try to understand the Seagulls' asking price. He added that they are not pursuing other targets as things stand, even though Brighton reportedly have 'no intention' of lowering their asking price of over Â£100million.",
      "Brighton boss Fabian Hurzeler says he has 'no fear' about the speculation surrounding Balebaâs future.",
      "\"No chance. I don't feel fear,\" he stated. \"I'm not afraid of anything because the only thing we can do is be the best version we can be every day, like work as hard as we can. All the other things we can't influence, so we really have to focus on us.",
      "\"For sure, we can't spend the money like the big teams but one of our biggest values is togetherness. And if you stay together, if we try to push our limits and increase the boundaries, then I'm sure we can compete with the big teams.\"",
      "But with Baleba's huge reported price tag, United may need to make some sales before looking at tying up a transfer. Baleba has featured in 61 top-flight matches in England over the past two seasons.",

      "Marcus Rashford needs to become greedier in front of goal if he wants to improve his game.",
      "That's the view of Micah Richards, who delivered the frank assessment directly to the Manchester United exile while highlighting a potential hole in his game. Rashford, 27, has linked up with the reigning La Liga kings Barcelona for the season following a loan spell at Aston Villa during the latter half of last season.",
      "The forward has already made his mark under Hansi Flick, finding the net and providing an assist across Barca's last two pre-season outings. Previously regarded as Old Trafford's brightest prospect, Rashford found he was deemed surplus to requirements after his goalscoring touch dimmed in Manchester.",
      "He managed only seven goals in his half-season before the Villa loan move - two fewer in 2023/24 and a staggering 23 fewer than 2022/23 in all competitions. Richards has identified what he considers a glaring weakness in the player's approach during an interview on The Rest Is Football podcast.",
      "\"One criticism from me in your game is I feel like you can be more selfish,\" said the ex-Manchester City defender. \"Because you're getting into great areas, then you always want to pass! All the other players [at the] top of world football are shooting.\"",
      "Rashford seemed receptive to the feedback but countered by indicating his focus extends beyond simply finding the back of the net. The 62-cap England attacker netted a career-best 30 goals during the 2022/23 season under Erik ten Hag before his form in front of goal suffered a serious downturn.",
      "\"Don't get me wrong, I love scoring goals and stuff, but this is why I can't consistently be a No. 9,\" Rashford replied. \"Because it's not natural for me to do that, so if I am doing that, I feel like I'm forcing it. And I know that I'm missing other pictures of the game.",
      "\"Like, if I was just playing freely, I'd be seeing these pictures, so there [are] a lot of times when I don't shoot because I feel like the chance of it being blocked and missing a chance for the team, rather than just for me, is pretty high. But also the striker in me is like, 'If I can get it through his legs here [laughs], there's a high chance of it going in!'\"",
      "These remarks could spark concern amongst certain United supporters, particularly those who recognise the goalscoring ability within the player. Rashford progressed through the club's youth system operating as a striker and emerged onto the first-team stage in 2016 with a reputation for his composed finishing.",
      "The player demonstrated his team-first mentality when deployed out wide to accommodate others playing through the middle. His style has evolved over the years as a result, with his ability to operate as a traditional central striker often coming under question.",
      "His natural instinct was evident when he netted his maiden Barcelona goal during a recent friendly against South Korean side Daegu though. The forward completed the 5-0 thrashing by unleashing a fierce effort past the goalkeeper from inside the area after a pass back from former City defender Eric Garcia.",
      "He then secured his first assist for Barca in the Joan Gamper Trophy, contributing to another commanding 5-0 victory over Italian side Como. However, the match also saw Rashford left red-faced after failing to score an open goal at the back post.",

      "With Benjamin Sesko signed, Manchester United can finally switch their focus to other areas of the squad in need of investment.",
      "The Slovenia international finalised his Â£66.4million move to Old Trafford from RB Leipzig on Saturday, becoming United's fourth signing of the summer and their third in the attacking department.",
      "Despite signing Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo earlier this summer, the addition of an out-and-out centre-forward remained United's leading priority ahead of the September 1 transfer deadline.",
      "United have finished each of the last two Premier League campaigns with a negative goal difference, meaning they were left with no choice but to prioritise attacking signings this summer. Between them, Mbeumo, Cunha and Sesko scored 58 goals for their former clubs last season.",
      "In Cunha and Mbeumo, United have sourced two players with impressive Premier League records. They have scored 71 career goals in the division between them, plundering 35 of them last season.",
      "Sesko, of course, has arrived from overseas, meaning there is more of a risk attached, but he should benefit from operating alongside two players with Premier League pedigree.",
      "United have often turned to the overseas market for new additions in recent years, regularly taking one too many gambles. The additions of Rasmus Hojlund and Antony, for example, rank as two of the worst signings in United's history when you consider their price tags.",
      "No transfer is guaranteed to be a success at any level of the game, but there is a lot less risk attached when recruiting a player that knows the league.",
      "Having not seen the best version of Manuel Ugarte all that often in the last 12 months, United are hoping to add a midfielder to their ranks before the window closes. Brighton ace Carlos Baleba has emerged as a target and he would be a terrific signing for Ruben Amorim.",
      "Despite only being 21, the Cameroonian, who joined Brighton from Lille two years ago, has become one of the Premier League's most highly-rated midfielders. The latest hidden talent to be discovered by the Seagulls, Baleba is capable of doing a little bit of everything in midfield.",
      "Renowned for his energy, his ball-carrying expertise, his passing range and his hunger to win the ball back, he ticks a lot of boxes for United. The Reds currently lack a midfielder that can do a little bit of everything in the engine room.",
      "Ugarte was drafted in last summer to provide some defensive nous and bite, but it has become clear he is limited when in possession. He struggles to progress the ball in the way United need him to.",
      "Kobbie Mainoo is an excellent operator with enormous amounts of potential, but his long-term position under Amorim is yet to be nailed down. Furthermore, he is a forward-thinking player and lacks the defensive ability to play next to Bruno Fernandes in a midfield duo.",
      "Casemiro is past his best and struggled last season to keep up with the pace of the play in the Premier League, reserving his best performances for the Europa League. He also has less than a year remaining on his contract and should be sold if a new midfielder arrives.",
      "Baleba, on the other hand, is up and coming. He has demonstrated he has what it takes to consistently make his mark in the Premier League and United do lack a midfielder of his profile.",
      "Of course, it has been well-documented Baleba will not come cheap, but United are well aware of that. Brighton will dig their heels in to try and secure as high a fee as possible.",
      "Despite only being 21, Baleba has only played 21 Premier League games fewer than Cunha, racking up 61 top flight appearances in England over the last two seasons.",
      "United often turned to the Premier League's best talent during Sir Alex Ferguson's heyday. After signing Cunha and Mbeumo from domestic rivals already this summer, United would be wise to do the same again to solve their next transfer objective.",
      "Manchester United have unveiled their new third kit for the 2025/26 season.",

      "An unnamed Manchester United player has already had a \"b********g\" from Tom Heaton.",
      "\"Yes, but only naturally,\" Heaton laughed. \"It's not just about delivering sort of b********gs as you put it. I think it's also about supporting people that need it, trying to make sure we're guiding it and channelling it in the right way.\"",
      "Heaton, Bruno Fernandes and Harry Maguire are the three players part of the old United leadership group who are in the new one, revived by Ruben Amorim. Heaton, 40 next year, signed a one-year deal with United in June and remains one of the most prominent voices in the dressing room.",
      "The newest members are Diogo Dalot, Lisandro Martinez and Noussair Mazraoui. It is a diverse blend of three 30-somethings and three players in their twenties, with four countries and three continents represented. The average age is just over 30.",
      "\"They are responsible for the group,\" Amorim explained. \"There are some things that in the last year I had to deal with. I said to them this year, you deal with that. Small issues are with you guys. You are responsible. All these small changes, I think it's helping the group.\"",
      "Heaton has a 14-year association with United through two separate stints and rejoined his boyhood club in 2021. \"I think he (Amorim) feels quite strongly about having a group of players that have a strong influence on the dressing room,\" Heaton explained, \"it provides a little bit of support to Bruno in that respect. That's how it came about and obviously honoured as ever to be part of that and try and have as much influence on it as I possibly can.\"",
      "Dalot is the second-longest serving member of the United squad after Luke Shaw, into his 12th year at the club. Shaw was a member of the octet established by Erik ten Hag but started four games last season, three of them in May.",
      "The MEN revealed last season Amorim gravitated towards Dalot and Fernandes. A natural development, given their shared nationality. Dalot is also fluent in four languages, which makes him one of the most approachable members of the squad.",
      "Cristiano Ronaldo mentioned Dalot and Martinez among three teammates he admired at United in 2022. Casemiro, the third, was also added to the original leadership group by Ten Hag.",
      "In 2024, Dalot emulated Ronaldo by becoming the United players' player of the year. A senior statesman of the squad, a polyglot, rarely injured and affable, it was easy to see why he got most teammates' vote.",
      "Dalot had his squad number upgraded to '2' by Amorim in the summer and he captained United in the second half of their goalless draw with Leeds United in Stockholm last month. The irony is he is no longer a certain starter, with Amad the favoured option on the right wing to collaborate with Bryan Mbeumo.",
      "Only one of the leadership group could feasibly start against Arsenal on Sunday - Fernandes. It is unlikely to cow the others in the dressing room.",
      "\"It obviously brings you even more responsibility,\" Dalot accepts, \"but I think one of the reasons why that happened is because of the way I am.",
      "\"So I try to be the same person, but obviously it brings you even more responsibility because we're talking about a very good group of players with different personalities that I think we can try to create a culture where we demand the maximum from our teammates, from ourselves as well.",
      "\"But we have to be the first ones to give the example. I think that's the best way that I like to lead also. We have to be the first ones to show to everyone where we want to put the club back on top and then try to put everyone in the same. Like we say in Portugal, everyone is in the same boat.\"",
      "Dalot is close to Ronaldo and had Raphael Varane and Casemiro within earshot during United's successful 2022-23 season, three serial winners to look up to. His fitness is so renowned he has missed only 13 club games since he returned to United from a season-long loan at AC Milan in 2021.",
      "A source said Dalot \"took every good trait when playing with Cristiano and only further enhanced his dedication\". Dalot wears leg compressors on long-haul flights to reduce any muscle soreness and maximise circulation.",
      "Sources have pointed out how much leaner and chiselled Dalot now looks in contrast to his unveiling pictures in June 2018. Dalot, 19 at the time, was recovering from a meniscus injury that kept him sidelined for three months but he had a cherub face. Now he employs a private chef to prepare his meals at home.",
      "Fernandes has only ever missed two United games through injury in five-and-a-half years. \"He has the highest pain threshold I have ever encountered,\" a Carrington source said.",
      "His influence remains profound. As recently as the 1-1 draw with Fiorentina on Saturday, Fernandes urged Patrick Dorgu to show more intensity in the 78th minute. A minute later, Dorgu was sprinting into the penalty area.",
      "Amorim included Mazraoui - signed by Ten Hag - as \"he's a character that I like\". Mazraoui played in seven different positions last season and was rested for only two games.",
      "Joshua Zirkzee enthused about how motivational a presence Martinez, sidelined since February 2 with a knee injury, has been in the treatment room. Martinez captained United in the 1-1 Europa League draw with Fenerbahce last year.",
      "Maguire, stripped of the captaincy by Ten Hag in July 2023, pulled the armband back on for the first time under Amorim during the 4-0 thrashing of Everton on December 1. Maguire's form over the past two seasons, having seen a Â£30million transfer to West Ham United collapse, is testament to his resolve. He is now one of a handful of respectable signings in the post-Ferguson era.",
      "United opened the doors to their renovated Carrington hub on Friday. Heaton, a veteran of training days at Lyttleton Road and The Cliff as a schoolboy, described the launch as \"a moment in the club. Especially for us as players, we're in it all the time. So I think we can use that to go again and build and move it forward and making sure that all the lads are aligned with that.\"",
      "Dalot is not as demonstrative as his compatriot Fernandes but is emboldened to pull players in line. \"Of course, otherwise we couldn't be in that group,\" he said. \"I think the decision was clear because obviously we're talking about six players with different personalities, but at the same time we need to start demanding more from each other, create this culture where when things are not going in the right direction, we have to be assertive and put it right.",
      "\"I think that's the only way to go to where we want to go.\"",
      "Expect a few more b********gs.",

      "If Ruben Amorim's starting XI against Fiorentina on Saturday confirmed anything, it was that Rasmus Hojlund will not be starting Sunday's Premier League opener against Arsenal at Old Trafford.",
      "The Dane was left out of the starting line-up for the second game running, with Amorim choosing to deploy Mason Mount up front instead.",
      "Whether Hojlund departs or not, Sesko is expected to be thrown straight into the starting XI this weekend and lead United's attack. He should be supported by fellow new recruits Bryan Mbeumo and Cunha, who occupied the two playmaker roles at the weekend.",
      "Following the penalty shootout triumph over Fiorentina, Amorim admitted he has an \"idea\" of what his starting XI will look like for the Premier League curtain-raiser against the Gunners. However, he did concede that his players could still alter his plans.",
      "When asked about having a selection headache, Amorim told MUTV: \"That is a good thing, it's supposed to be like that, not like last season when we had to struggle to put 11 players on the pitch.",
      "\"This is a normal thing, so I have to think and they need to fight during the week so they can change my mind. I have one idea, but they can change my mind during the week.\"",
      "With five days to go until the clash with Arsenal, United fans are beginning to share predictions and their opinions on what the starting XI should look like. Many of their predicted XIs have similar looks and it is unlikely their submissions will be far from the XI that is revealed at 3.15pm on Sunday afternoon.",
      "Factoring in how pre-season unfolded and how the landscape of the squad currently looks, it can be argued that eight starters are guaranteed: Andre Onana (expected to be back fit), Leny Yoro, Amad, Bruno Fernandes, Patrick Dorgu, Mbeumo, Cunha and Sesko.",
      "However, there is a debate to be had about who will start in the centre and on the left of the defence and alongside Fernandes in midfield.",
      "Harry Maguire and Ayden Heaven started against Fiorentina and Casemiro got the nod in the engine room next to Fernandes. The latter's performance reminded United of why they are still in need of a midfielder.",
      "Yoro is the only centre-back guaranteed to start against the Gunners after making four starts in a row in pre-season and producing some really promising performances, particularly in the United States. De Ligt bagged three starts, likewise Luke Shaw, but Maguire and Heaven only started twice.",
      "Maguire and De Ligt are competing to start in the middle of the defence and that battle was always likely to be decided by pre-season performances. Heaven has made rapid progress since joining United and is an exciting option for the left-sided centre-back role, but Shaw is also in the conversation to start.",
      "The other selection dilemma facing Amorim is who should start in midfield next to Fernandes. Kobbie Mainoo, Manuel Ugarte and Casemiro are competing for that spot and the latter earned three starts in pre-season.",
      "However, he showed last season he struggles to keep up with the pace of the play in the Premier League. Ugarte is a solid midfield destroyer, capable of winning the ball back, but he is limited in possession.",
      "Mainoo has talent Amorim needs to tap into, but the prospect of him and Fernandes starting next to each other in midfield risks leaving United exposed in the centre of the pitch.",
      "With eight starters looking nailed on, three places remain up for grabs.",
      "Manchester United have unveiled their new third kit for the 2025/26 season.",

      "Manchester United could go on to get more deals over the line before their Premier League opener against Arsenal this weekend.",
      "United host the Gunners at Old Trafford on Sunday in their first Premier League match of the new season.",
      "Ruben Amorim is busy gearing up for his first full season as United's head coach after being appointed in November last year. The club have enjoyed an impressive pre-season and have confidence heading into the new campaign.",
      "United have made three new signings so far this summer, with Bryan Mbeumo, Matheus Cunha and Benjamin Sesko all joining, while Diego Leon has arrived after a deal was struck in January. There is the potential for more new signings to come, though, with two players in particular being heavily linked with moves to United.",
      "Brighton midfielder Carlos Baleba and Paris Saint-Germain goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma have both been linked with signing for United this summer. Baleba is reported to be valued at around Â£100million by the Seagulls, while Donnarumma is expected to leave PSG either this summer for a fee or next summer as a free agent when his contract expires.",
      "If United were to somehow sign both players, each of the duo would be expected to go straight into the first-choice starting line-up. Donnarumma would compete with Andre Onana for the starting spot, and could lead to speculation about the United No.24's future. Donnarumma's arrival would also lead to rumours about Altay Bayindir's future at Old Trafford.",
      "When it comes to the midfield, Baleba could take on a role in a double pivot alongside club captain Bruno Fernandes in the middle of the park. United would also have Casemiro, Mason Mount, Kobbie Mainoo and Manuel Ugarte who could perform in the role alongside Baleba.",
      "The forward line is likely to be made up of all three new signings with Mebumo and Cunha on the wings and Sesko through the middle as the centre forward. Amad's versatility could allow him to be an option as a winger as well as a wing-back, while Joshua Zirkzee could provide competition as a striker. The same could also be said for Rasmus Hojlund, unless the forward goes on to leave Old Trafford amid speculation of a potential move to AC Milan.",

      "Manchester United have made a decision on Carlos Baleba as Brighton âhave to listen to offersâ for the midfielder, who will be their ânext major saleâ.",
      "United have already signed Matheus Cunha (Â£62.5m), Bryan Mbeumo (Â£65m), Benjamin Sesko (Â£74m) and Diego Leon (Â£7m)Â this summer despite Sir Jim Ratcliffeâs insistence that theyâre short on cash.",
      "And reports suggest they still want to bring in a goalkeeper and central midfielder before the window closes on September 1.",
      "Baleba is reportedly seen as the âperfectâ midfielder by Ruben Amorim and transfer expert Fabrizio Romano brought the latest on a potential deal for the Seagulls star on Tuesday with United looking to âunderstand the final official costâ before making a bid.",
      "Romano said onÂ GiveMeSport: âThey would also like to know the actual cost because with Brighton, itâs never easy to negotiate, and they are very good at negotiations.",
      "READ:Â PSR? What PSR? Eight Premier League sides in 10 biggest spenders of summer 2025",
      "âSo in this context, they are having with the agents of the player, they are waiting to understand how much it will cost, because the rumour in the industry is something around Â£120million.",
      "âBut at the moment, Manchester United are still waiting to understand the final official cost for Baleba â to understand when and how to try to make a bid, and to try to approach Brighton for Baleba.",
      "âFor sure, the player is keen on the move, and the player is not closing doors to Manchester United even without European football. Baleba is keen on joining Manchester United, and now it will depend on the two clubs. My understanding is that Manchester United want to try.â",
      "Italian journalistÂ Nicola Schira revealed earlier this week that Man Utd have already struck âan agreement in principleâ with the Brighton midfielder.",
      "Schira wrote on X: â#ManchesterUnited consider Carlos #Baleba as a main target and are ready to push to sign him. #MUFC are set to submit the first official bid to #Brighton as revealed today. Baleba has an agreement in principle with #mutd for a contract until 2030 + option for 2031. #transfersâ",
      "Now The Telegraph claim that although Baleba âis the midfielder thatÂ Unitedâs Ineos hierarchy would wish to signâ, Brightonâs valuation of âmore than Â£100mâ means the deal is a non-starter.",
      "Brighton, âas a trading club would have to listen to offersÂ at the kind of level that would get close to the club record Â£115m fee Chelsea paid for Moises Caicedoâ and are aware that Baleba will be âthe next major saleâ, but he isÂ âpriced above what United would be prepared to pay this summerâ.",
      "The report adds:",
      "âFor United, Baleba is a player of great interest and is entering a period in his career where his value could conceivably climb again with another successful season â potentially putting him out of range. The club need a midfielder of his profile but ultimately it was decided to put the resources this summer into signing attacking players, culminating in the Â£73.7m deal to sign the Slovenian forward Benjamin Sesko.",
      "âBrighton are in a strong position with such progress by the player early in his five-year deal which gives them the option of turning down offers this summer. There is an argument that United would be better served looking in the same European market for a player of similar promise, although few have done that as well as Brighton.â",

      "19) ð Jadon Sancho â Manchester United to Besiktas\nDortmund remain interested which we think is more out of habit than curiosity these days but Besiktas have emerged as a possible destination for Sancho. Apparently, their fans left five million comments on his most recent Instagram post. Which is lovely but United canât take that to the bank. Besiktas are no more likely to pay than any of the other teams whoâve expressed an interest in Sancho, so this will go close to the deadline and wherever he goes, itâll probably be a loan with wages covered.",
      "",
      "18) ð½ Carlos Baleba â Brighton to Manchester United\nBaleba would make United a very passable football team. But United are dealing with Brighton, which isnât easy even when they arenât reluctant to sell. It comes down to this: Brighton value Baleba at Â£100million. Man Utd do not. Are Brighton likely to come down? No. No they are not.",
      "",
      "17) ð Savinho â Manchester City to Tottenham Hotspur\nApparently, Spurs are very keen on the City winger, though the reports that Â£43million might do the trick appear to be wide of the mark. Pep Guardiola seems to trust Savinho and we canât imagine that selling the 21-year-old was part of the plan for this summer. Which makes us wonder what City might be up toâ¦",
      "",
      "16) ð Rasmus Hojlund â Manchester United to AC Milan\nPre-Sesko, the noises coming from Hojlund suggested he wanted to stay at United. Then he watched the Sesko unveiling before staying on the bench for the entirety of the draw with Fiorentina, all of which seems to have opened his mind more to the idea of joining AC Milan. The obvious problem for United: Milan canât afford the Â£40million being asked. Mercifully for them, it seems there is a queue starting to form in Italy, with Inter, Roma, Juve and Napoli all jostling for position.",

      "15) ð½ Harvey Elliott â Liverpool to Tottenham\nThomas Frank was, well, frank in admitting that Spurs will need a replacement for James Maddison after the playmaker was ruled out for much of the season with an ACL injury. This makes sense if the two clubs can make the numbers work. And Liverpool want that number to be at least Â£40million. RB Leipzig are keen. The Germans are unlikely to compete in a bidding war but they could offer a buy-back option which is said to be part of the conditions Liverpool have laid out. Elliott is said to be interested in what the Bundesliga has to offer.",
      "14) ð Gianluigi Donnarumma â PSG to Manchester City\nDonnarumma will definitely leave PSG. Where he ends up is less certain, but City are the current frontrunners. James Trafford will be dead chuffed.",
      "",
      "13) ð¼ Kevin â Shakhtar Donetsk to Fulham\nFulham face the prospect of losing Rodrigo Muniz to Atalanta but the Â£30million-plus they receive from the Italians looks likely to be shifted straight to Shakhtarâs account in a deal which could break the Cottagerâs record spend. Itâs about time Fulham got around to doing something.\n12) Eberechi Eze â Crystal Palace to Arsenal\nEze is the Gunnersâ next top target and the England star has, apparently, been telling his mates heâs moving to the Emirates, but Arsenal are yet to deliver on Palaceâs clear demand for his Â£68million buy-out clause to be met. And their dithering could leave the door open forâ¦",
      "",
      "11) Eberechi Eze â Crystal Palace to Tottenham\nSpursâ need for attacking reinforcements is clear and multiple reports suggest they have opened talks about a move for Eze. They, though, do not intend to pay the amount necessary to trigger the England starâs buy-out clause. And the feeling is Eze would prefer Arsenal, which gives Spurs a brief window to strike a deal while their north London neighbours attempt to raise the necessary cash through sales.",
      "",
      "10) Dango Ouattara â Bournemouth to Brentford\nApparently, the Bees are one of a few clubs to have been in touch about the 23-year-old, who has told Bournemouth that he wants to explore his options. We doubt he had Brentford in mind when he was thinking about taking the next step but it seems this one is moving forward. Which would improve Yoane Wissaâs mood.",
      "",
      "9) Alexander Isak â Newcastle to Liverpool\nIsak is employing a scorched earth approach to getting out of Newcastle, leaving his legacy in tatters by refusing to play for the club again or reintegrate with Eddie Howeâs squad. Itâs a ballsy approach â a d*ckish one too â and Isak needs to hope his desire is matched by Liverpool. We expect a move will happen because itâs in neither the player nor Newcastleâs interest to stay together, but the Toon need something they can present as a win, like a British transfer record fee up front. Not one made up of countless add-ons if Isak wins the Ballon dâOr or Grand National.",

      "8) ð½ Tyler Dibling â Southampton to Everton\nDavid Moyes has voiced his concerns about the Toffeesâ lack of transfer activity, and his bosses have taken note. Dibling is reportedly the subject of a Â£35million-plus-Â£8million offer, but the Saints want more up front. Dibling has been withdrawn from some aspects of training and wasnât included in Will Stillâs squad for their Championship opener, though, so a deal cannot be far off. Could Jack Grealishâs arrival impact things?",
      "",
      "7)Â ð¼ Yoane Wissa â Brentford to Newcastle\nEveryone seems to be turning down Newcastle recently, but Wissa is one player who does want to join the Magpies. Strongly enough to go up against Brentford while they rebuff the Toonâs interest. At least until the offers reach around Â£40million. The best Newcastle have come up so far is Â£25million but an improved offer is expected this week. They would be wise not to waste theirs and Brentfordâs time with another low-ball bid.",
      "",
      "6) Xavi Simons â RB Leipzig to Chelsea\nA Chelsea move appeals to Simons and the Blues are keen to make it happen. They are hoping Leipzig take back Â£40million-rated Christopher Nkunku as part of the deal.",
      "",
      "5) ð¼ Alejandro Garnacho â Manchester United to Chelsea\nItâs âChelsea or nowhereâ in Garnachoâs mind and, to be honest, weâre curious to see what ânowhereâ looks like. Of course, it wonât reach that stage because United want rid as much as the winger wants out. All of which Chelsea know and they will take their sweet time to get the best possible terms. United wanted at least Â£40million; we think they will settle for less as the deadline approaches.",
      "",
      "4) ð¼ Marc Guehi â Crystal Palace to Liverpool\nPalace admit they may have to sell Guehi this summer rather than lose a Â£40million-rated asset for nothing in a year. Liverpoolâs struggles in defence against the Eagles in the Community Shield ought to refocus their minds, especially with Chelsea pondering how to fill the void left by Levi Colwillâs injury; not so especiallyÂ Manchester Unitedâs âofficial approachâÂ for which huge fistfuls of salt are required. Alas, their interest has intensified and personal terms reportedly agreed.",
      "",
      "3) ð Giovanni Leoni â Parma to Liverpool\nLiverpool want Leoni in addition to Guehi and they might need to spend the same again to get the 18-year-old away from Parma. Apparently, Leoni is bang up for it having been told he will go straight into Arne Slotâs first-team squad.",
      "",
      "2) ð¼ Jacob Ramsey â Aston Villa to Newcastle\nAnother one who seems to want to join Newcastleâ¦ perhaps this species isnât as rare as it was previously thought. Romano reckons a verbal agreement is almost done after the two clubs were talking around the Â£40million mark.",
      "",
      "1) ð¼ James McAtee â Manchester City to Nottingham Forest\nIt looks like Forest will win the race for McAtee, who has attracted interest from Germany. Reports suggest heâll cost north of Â£20m having agreed personal terms with the City Ground club."

      "",
      "Arsenal: Noni Madueke\nMax Dowman would have been a fun inclusion, but heâs only 15. The old saying is that âif youâre good enough, youâre old enough,â but we canât see Mikel Arteta giving the incredibly talented winger significant minutes this season.",
      "With that in mind, itâs a new winger weâre backing to be a surprise success at the Emirates. He cost around Â£50m and joined Arsenal amid fan protests online. #NoToMadueke was trending on X. There were petitions. Deplorable stuff from supposed âfansâ.Â The big cheer the ex-Chelsea man received on his first touch at the Emirates underlines the difference between match-going supporters and those who live chronically online.",
      "Still, there are big doubts over Maduekeâs ability to justify his big fee, exacerbated by him beingÂ another Chelsea player that Arteta has been bizarrely happy to take off their hands. Hereâs hoping those doubts cease to exist in a couple of months.",
      "",
      "Aston Villa: Ollie Watkins\nVilla have been pretty quiet in the summer window and new signings are usually the go-to for this kind of feature. With that in mind, weâre plonking for Watkins. Surprised? Understandable.",
      "We think Watkins has a point to prove. Heâs been overlooked by Newcastle United all summer; Manchester United picked Benjamin Sesko over him, and Chelsea, Liverpool, and Arsenal ignored him to pursue other targets. Why? Because heâs 29. With the bit between his teeth this season, Villa might get the best season of Watkinsâ career.",
      "Of course, this all relies on Watkins not being sold before the window closes.",
      "",
      "Bournemouth: Alex Scott\nWeâre predicting young Scott will elevate his game to another level this season. He remains one of the most promising young midfielders in the Premier League but has flown under the radar since swapping Bristol City for Bournemouth in August 2023.",
      "The 21-year-old is developing at a comfortable level, but this could be the season he truly explodes.",
      "",
      "Brentford: Yegor Yarmolyuk\nThere arenât too many reasons to be optimistic as a Brentford fan. Bryan Mbeumo, Christian Norgaard and Thomas Frank have all left, and Yoane Wissa will soon follow. Itâs a difficult time, but the Bees with their Moneyball approach will feel well-equipped upstairs to cope with such drastic change.",
      "One of their players destined for a big-money departure within the next two years is Ukrainian midfielder Yarmolyuk. Expectations are high but zero goals or assists in 15 Premier League matches in 2024/25 was obviously a disappointing return. He literally canât do any worse this season. We can see a Mikkel Damsgaard-like improvement on the horizon.",
      "",
      "Brighton: Brajan Gruda\nPicking one of Brightonâs many impressive signings would be too easy.",
      "Gruda finished last season strong, bagging his first Premier League goal along with three assists in Albionâs final five matches, of which they won four and drew one, courtesy of an 89th-minute Alexander Isak penalty for Newcastle.",
      "The 21-year-old German also impressed for his country at the Under-21 Euros this summer and is one to watch in the Premier League in 2025/26.",
      "",
      "Burnley: Hannibal Mejbri\nKnown as nothing more than a wrecking-ball passion merchant during his Manchester United days, Hannibal was impressive for Burnley in the Championship, helping them gain promotion with 100 points.",
      "His energy in the middle of the pitch will be important in the Claretsâ bid for survival. Weâre not confident in the slightest about their survival chances, but we think the 22-year-old Moroccan can make a name for himselfâ¦if he doesnât get sent off three times.",
      "",
      "Chelsea: Estevao Willian\nNot enough people are aware of how good this young man is. Chelsea have picked up an absolute gem, who will hopefully be more Neymar than Robinho.",
      "The 18-year-old winger is not being loaned out, and the only thing holding him back from exploding this season is the vast number of wide forwards at Chelsea. And Alejandro Garnacho is expected to join from Man United.",
      "If Estevao gets sufficient minutes, heâll establish himself as a regular starter for the Blues. Watch this space.",
      "",
      "Crystal Palace: Daichi Kamada\nMany people backed Kamada to be the bargain of the season when he joined the Eagles for free last summer, but he was very underwhelming until around February, when he looked much more comfortable in Oliver Glasnerâs team.",
      "He was a superb player for Glasner at Eintracht Frankfurt and the Japanese international is showing signs of getting close to that level again. If he does, Palace have a real gem.",
      "",
      "Everton: Jake OâBrien\nThere is too much of a bias towards attackers and midfielders, so Evertonâs surprise package will be Irish defender OâBrien.",
      "He did well playing right-back under David Moyes and we reckon his consistency levels will be surprisingly good this season.",
      "Everton could be a fun team to watch this season, with Jack Grealish joining Iliman Ndiaye. If they get Tyler Dibling, I will be changing allegiance from Arsenalâ¦",
      "",
      "Fulham: Calvin Bassey\nOne of the more difficult teams, Fulham. Benjamin Lecomte is their only summer signing so far, which is far from ideal.",
      "As a result, weâre going rogue. Bassey will be surprisinglyâ¦rubbish. Yep, heâs the one player weâre backing to go the other way.",
      "",
      "Leeds United: Dan James\nExcellent in the Championship, James has a point to prove in the top flight. Everyone thinks heâs nothing more than a pace merchant in the big league. Time to show everyone they were wrong about you, kid.",
      "There are a few new signings we considered, such as Anton Stach and Jaka Bijol, but ultimately opted for former Man United winger James.",
      "",
      "Liverpool: Conor Bradley\nOur logic is simple: Bradley will usurp Jeremie Frimpong as Arne Slotâs first-choice right-back. Frimpong as an out-and-out full-back scares us. Sure, he will have lots more attacking responsibility than defensive, but heâs more vulnerable playing there than Trent Alexander-Arnold ever was. And Trent got away with it thanks to his world-class technical ability. Frimpong has to do the same by chipping in with goals and assists for Liverpool or Bradley will seize his opportunity.",
      "",
      "Manchester City: Tijjani Reijnders\nPeople donât realise how good this guy is. Reijnders will take the Premier League by storm. Just you wait.",
      "",
      "Manchester United: Joshua Zirkzee\nNobody knows this guyâs best position, but he might just stumble across it this season. Heâs made for one of those âwide 10â roles in Ruben Amorimâs system, and while Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha have been signed, Zirkzee should get enough minutes to impress and give his head coach a real selection headache.",
      "Failing that, Zirkzee will become a more technical version of the Joelinton weâve seen transform from a bumbling striker to an outstanding box-to-box midfielder for Newcastle.",
      "",
      "Newcastle United: Aaron Ramsdale\nThe surprise of Newcastleâs summer is Alexander Isakâs desire to leave. Or being rejected by most of their top targets after qualifying for the Champions League and winning a major trophy. Itâs not been fun.",
      "But watching Ramsdale should be interesting this season. Heâs one of the few players Newcastle have convinced to join them this summer, yet fans are underwhelmed. Just as Arsenal fans were when they signed him. They quickly fell in love with the eccentric goalkeeper, and we think the same will happen in the north east.",
      "",
      "Nottingham Forest: Igor Jesus\nForest ended last season poorly, which cost them Champions League football. They were knackered and simply ran out of steam. That points towards more struggles this term, with the Thursday-Sunday schedule destined to take its toll. Nuno Espirito Santo needs a big and fit squad after using the fewest players in last seasonâs Premier League (23).",
      "With that in mind, weâre backing a summer signing to be Forestâs surprise package. Signed from Botafogo, Jesus scored match-winning goals in the Club World Cup against Seattle Sounders and European champions Paris Saint-Germain. More of the same in Our League, please.",
      "",
      "Sunderland: Chris Rigg\nThe Black Cats have been busy bees this summer. At the time of writing, theyâve signed 11 players. Their most notable addition is undoubtedly former Arsenal captain Granit Xhaka, while there are high hopes for Simon Adingra, Habib Diarra and Noah Sadiki. Those three signings give us 2023/24 Burnley flashbacks, but we have higher hopes for this mob. And no, weâre not being naive. Shut up.",
      "Anyhow, the surprise star could well be Chris Rigg. The 18-year-old midfielder is destined for big things but is unlikely to be a regular starter in the Premier League, which is fine. We think that could change, with Rigg standing out in Regis Le Brisâ side, forcing the French manager to make him a key player.",
      "",
      "Tottenham Hotspur: Mohammed Kudus\nCan a Â£55m signing really be a surprise star? Probably not. They are expected to do well. Regardless, Kudus is our Spurs representative.",
      "Under Thomas Frank, and in a positive atmosphere after a miserable season for West Ham, we think Kudus will thrive, exceeding expectations to make Spurs both fun to watch and competent. Unthinkable, innit? Big Ange could never balance the two.",
      "Hereâs a prediction that nobody asked for and unnecessarily puts our neck on the line: 12 goals, seven assists in the Premier League.",
      "",
      "West Ham: Jean-Clair Todibo\nAre we optimistic about West Ham this season? Absolutely not. Do any of their new signings stand out as especially exciting? Nope. Are we inspired by anyone in their squad enough to claim theyâll be a surprise star this season? Nah. Yet, weâve somehow stumbled onto Todibo.",
      "The French centre-back flopped in his first season at the London Stadium, but the Hammers were forced to sign him permanently from Nice for over Â£25m, having set the incredibly low buy-obligation bar of avoiding relegation.",
      "After a difficult year, we are backing Todibo to be a much bigger success this term. He wonât become a leading Premier League defender, but weâre fairly sure his consistency levels will rise and heâll become one of West Hamâs more reliable players.",
      "",
      "Wolves: David Moller Wolfe\nCards on the tableâ¦I donât know an awful lot about Wolfe. What I do know is that heâs a left-back coming to the Premier League from AZ Alkmaar. Milos Kerkez did that two years ago and he turned out pretty good.",
      "Replacing Rayan Ait-Nouri will be tough, but not as tough, or as high-profile, as replacing Matheus Cunha, which Fer Lopez and Jhon Arias have been tasked with doing. Itâs a big job for Wolfe, but thereâs not the same pressure, which is only a good thing. Wing-back is a vitally important position these days and Vitor Pereiraâs style of play should enable the 23-year-old to thrive in 25/26.",
      "READ NEXT:Â Cunha, Mbuemo or Sesko could be Man Utdâs Eric Cantona this seasonâ¦",
      "Man Utd forward Joshua Zirkzee is ânot really worriedâ about the Red Devils being linked to Benjamin Sesko and Ollie Watkins this summer.",
      "This summer has confirmed the existence of the Premier League tax beyond all doubt, but Liverpool have speculated to accumulate the most expensively.",
      "Arsenal midfielder Declan Rice has hit out at the Gunners fans that criticised the signing of Noni Madueke before he even arrived at the Emirates Stadium.",
      "An ex-Arsenal striker has urged the Gunners to sign a free agent forward after sealing the Â£63m deal for Viktor Gyokeres this summer.",
      "Marc Cucurella has questioned the timing of Noni Maduekeâs transfer to Arsenal, calling it âstrangeâ and a missed opportunity.",
      "This summer has confirmed the existence of the Premier League tax beyond all doubt, with one Arsenal transfer unsurprisingly taking the expensive biscuit."

      "",
      "Mustafa is backâ¦\nWe talk about football like itâs a science. Systems, xG, squad depth, rotations. And yet, season after season, one truth keeps punching through the data: sometimes, one player really does make all the difference.",
      "Eric Cantona proved it. United in the early â90s were talented but incomplete. Fergusonâs team had promise, but not inevitability. Cantona arrived from Leeds in â92 and instantly tilted the Premier League on its axis. It wasnât just his goals or assists â rather it was the attitude and swagger. United stopped hoping to win and started expecting to. Four titles in five seasons. Thatâs not coincidence.",
      "Leicester had their own catalyst in NâGolo KantÃ©. Vardyâs goals and Mahrezâs magic made headlines, but without KantÃ©âs supernatural ground coverage, theyâre not lifting that trophy in 2016. The next season, he did exactly the same thing for Chelsea. Back-to-back titles with two different clubs? Try replicating that in Football Manager.",
      "Not every talisman brings a title, but the uplift can still be obvious. Bruno Fernandes didnât win the league for United when he arrived in January 2020, but he did jolt the whole side awake. Before Bruno: hesitant, flat, predictable. After Bruno: quick, risk-taking, and suddenly worth watching again.",
      "It works the other way, too. Lose the wrong player, and the drop can be instant. United selling Jaap Stam in 2001 remains one of Fergusonâs few open regrets. The defence was never quite the same until VidiÄ arrived years later.",
      "City felt it when Vincent Kompany left in 2019. The squad was still stacked, but the leadership gap was obvious. You canât measure what Kompany brought with stats alone â the calm in the chaos, the barked instructions, the refusal to shrink. His thunderbolt against Leicester in the 2019 title run-in wasnât just a goal; it was a captain grabbing the season by the throat.",
      "Injuries and suspensions can have the same seismic impact. Cantonaâs kung-fu ban in â95 arguably cost United the title. More recently, City losing Rodri for a spell last season was the closest thing to vulnerability theyâve had in years. Without him, they dropped points and looked â briefly â mortal. When your defensive midfielder is also your tempo-setter, organiser and outlet, losing him is like removing the keystone from an arch.",
      "Which brings us to the here and now. Whoâs to say one of Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbuemo, or Benjamin Å eÅ¡ko couldnât be that magic switch for United this season? Maybe even one-third of that trio. Football history is full of players who arrived without fanfare but altered the whole weather system of a club.",
      "And yes â for United to finish outside the top seven after the last two seasons wouldnât shock anyone. But them winning the league? Thatâs still possible. All the hand-wringing and mockery after I dared to suggest it last time was fascinating. People talk like the gap between first and fifteenth is a canyon. It isnât. This is the top tier. Everyone starts with zero points, everyoneâs an elite athlete with two legs and a brain wired for competition. Margins, not mountains, decide things.",
      "Fans of clubs like United donât watch for the comfort of ârespectableâ finishes. Weâre not and never want to be Arsenal â popping champagne for fourth place. Eww! We watch for the thrill of potential glory. For the hope that the next signing, the next breakthrough, the next moment of magic might turn a season. Thatâs the drug.",
      "Because sometimes it only takes one player. Sometimes itâs the swagger of a Cantona, the legs of a KantÃ©, the leadership of a Kompany, or the control of a Rodri. Sometimes itâs a kid no oneâs talking about in August whoâs a household name by May.",
      "And thatâs why, even when the data, the form table and the pundits all say âbe realisticâ, I canât bring myself to close the door.

      "Benjamin Sesko, Viktor Gyokeres and Hugo Ekitike have joined Manchester United, Arsenal and Liverpool, respectively, meaning they are no longer headlining this ranking of the 10 best available strikers.",
      "Despite signing Ekitike, Liverpool are still in for Newcastle United rebel Alexander Isak, who has crashed into this ranking to take top spot.",
      "We also have the best available attacking midfielders, centre-backs, wingers, and defensive midfielders.",
      "",
      "10) Lois Openda (RB Leipzig)\nLeipzig have already lost Benjamin Sesko, but they are reportedly willing to listen to offers for Openda, who has scored 33 goals in 67 Bundesliga matches.",
      "Sunderland have, ambitiously, been linked with the Belgian, while Aston Villa chose Evann Guessand over him.",
      "",
      "9) Nicolas Jackson (Chelsea)\nJackson divides opinion, but his Premier League record is far from terrible. In fact, itâs pretty good. A brace against West Ham last September put him on 17 non-penalty league goals for Chelsea, which was more than Mohamed Salah managed for Liverpool (16) since the African strikerâs move from Villarreal a year earlier. He scored 14 and assisted five in 35 in 2023/24 and then recorded as many assists and 10 goals in 30 last term.",
      "Yes, Jackson is a big-chances-missed extraordinaire, but those numbers canât be sniffed at. Clubs fighting for European football shouldnât turn their nose at him, and the 24-year-old would also be a solid option for any foreign clubs that sell a striker on this list, including Leipzig.",
      "",
      "8) Randal Kolo Muani (Paris Saint-Germain)\nAfter a successful six-month loan at Juventus, Kolo Muani is likely to join the Italian giants permanently, or sign on loan for the entirety of 2025/26. Nothing is guaranteed though, and we could see the Frenchman move to the Premier League this summer.",
      "Newcastle are apparently in the picture. Aston Villa shouldnât be ruled out either. But yes, a return to Turin feels inevitable.",
      "The Parisiens paid a whopping Â£80m for the 26-year-old in 2023 but heâs only managed 11 goals in 57 matches for them. Heâs been a colossal flop but thereâs still hope for Kolo Muani.",
      "MORE:Â Ten players in the Club World Cup shop window for Premier League scouts",
      "",
      "7) Aleksandar Mitrovic (Al Hilal)\nMitrovic has been sitting around, watching his current employers aggressively pursuing striker after striker all summer. They eventually landed Darwin Nunez, which removes his name from this ranking and allows Mitrovic to crash in.",
      "A return to the Premier League has been mooted and there are plenty of teams that could be a lot worse. Heâs scored 68 in 79 for the Saudi club, which does beg the question: Why did they want a new striker so badly? Ah well, their loss is another teamâs gain. If Leeds United could pull this off, it would be an incredible coup.",
      "",
      "6) Dusan Vlahovic (Juventus)\nDusan Vlahovic turned down Arsenal for Juventus in 2022, and itâs hard to fault him â it looked like the right call at the time. But hindsight is cruel and Arsenal are going a lot better than the Old Lady.",
      "Things havenât quite clicked for the Serbian in Turin. A goal every three games is fine, but not what you expect from a Â£70m signing. Juventus are reportedly open to selling, though swap deals seem to be their go-to route.",
      "Itâs tough to pin down his next move. Heâs good enough to start for a big club, but not quite good enough to justify a bidding war. Vlahovicâs future might be the most unpredictable on this list.",
      "",
      "5) Yoane Wissa (Brentford)\nThere are two significant numbers when it comes to Wissa: 29 and 19. The first is how old he turns on September 3, which might put off some clubs, and the other is his 2024/25 Premier League goal tally, which should be enough to put any age reservations to bed.",
      "Brentford donât want to lose Wissa after selling Bryan Mbeumo to Manchester United, and are in a strong financial situation after earning Â£65m for the Cameroonian a year after getting Â£27m for David Raya and Â£40m for Ivan Toney.",
      "Having broken a promise to the striker, the Bees are actively scouring the market for a replacement, so Wissa can get his move to Newcastle for around Â£30m.",
      "",
      "4) Christopher Nkunku (Chelsea)\nDuring his time at Leipzig, Nkunku tore up the Bundesliga, recording a ridiculous 90 goal contributions in 119 league games.",
      "The Frenchman has been unable to replicate that form at Chelsea, with an early injury making it difficult to break into Mauricio Pochettinoâs team, which then contributed to a lack of Premier League minutes under Enzo Maresca.",
      "Despite his underwhelming Blues stint, Nkunku is an incredible market opportunity. Newcastle have been linked, though their current focus is the aforementioned Wissa. A return to Germany seems the most likely move, with Leipzig keen on a reunion.",
      "Like Wissa, Nkunku can play anywhere in attack, but unlike Wissa, he is also capable of operating in an attacking midfield role. If heâs available for under Â£35m, there should be a long queue of potential suitors. We have to assume he isnât available for under Â£35m, because there are hardly any suitors.",

      "3) Victor Boniface (Bayer Leverkusen)\nVictor Boniface is the forgotten striker of the 2025 summer transfer window. Heâs the third-best available one out there, yet there is nothing to suggest he could leave Leverkusen this summer.",
      "Boniface was reportedly close to joining Al Nassr in January but they went for Jhon Duran instead, so there is clearly an openness on Leverkusenâs side to sell, while the player is happy to take on a new challenge.",
      "The Nigerianâs stock was at its peak during Leverkusenâs unbeaten Bundesliga run in 2023/24, but heâs still a hugely viable option for big European sides. He shouldnât be vanishing into the Saudi wilderness just yet, regardless of how many zeroes are on the cheque.",
      "",
      "2) Ollie Watkins (Aston Villa)\nThere was an offer from Arsenal in January that was incredibly ill-timed as Aston Villa had just agreed to sell Duran, but both club and player would likely be interested if the Gunners returned again.",
      "The problem? Watkins is now 29, which is a similar mark against his name as Brentfordâs Wissa. Thatâs why Manchester United picked Benjamin Sesko.",
      "But he does guarantee Premier League goals, delivering double figures in each of his last five seasons. If heâs patient, he might be the beneficiary of late panic. Hello, Newcastle.",
      "",
      "1) Alexander Isak (Newcastle United)\nThis is getting awfully messy. Isak reportedly informed Newcastle of his decision to leave last month, amid interest from Liverpool. Since then, the Reds have failed with a Â£110m bid, the Magpies have failed to sign their number-one target to replace him, Benjamin Sesko, Isak hasnât featured in pre-season, is training alone, has moved out of his house, and most importantly, was not allowed any hotdogs.",
      "Liverpool have already spent over Â£100m on Florian Wirtz, Â£70m combined on full-backs Jeremie Frimpong and Milos Kerkez, and an initial Â£69m on Ekitike, but they still want Isak. After selling Darwin Nunez and Luis Diaz for over Â£100m, we should expect a second bid. Â£150m should do it.",
      "Isak is one of the best strikers in world football, and his transfer stance has shocked many and rightly upset Newcastle fans, who are now dreading the loss of their talisman. The Swedish international has scored 54 goals in 86 Premier League appearances for the Magpies.",
      "",
      "Liverpool have been told how they can âbreak the logjamâ and sign Alexander Isak this summer as Newcastle âstill need a number of positionsâ.",
      "Premier League football will be back soon, and hopefully we can all just stop making things up about transfers and cup draws.",
      "The Alexander Isak Transfer Saga is now officially scaling heights the like of which we may never see again. Thank you, Newcastle. Thank you, Liverpool.",
      "Liverpool are reportedly set to âbid againâ for Newcastle United striker Alexander Isak as the amount they are prepared to pay is revealed.",
      "Newcastle star Alexander Isak simply âwants a move to another clubâ. But if he was leaving Liverpool he would be a âfraudâ, âmercenaryâ and âout of orderâ.",
      "Newcastle United striker Alexander Isak has moved out of his property in theÂ North East as he continues to force a move to Liverpool, according to reports."

      "",
      "Pre-season predictions ahoy\nAnd just like that, weâre almost at the dawn of another Premier League season. With this in my mind, I thought Iâd share a few thoughts and predictions;",
      "1) There will be a proper title fight â Liverpool look to have spent very well, however we all know that players coming into the Prem from other leagues are not guaranteed to be successful. I also think they look a bit thin at the back, and one serious injury to a first-choice centre back leaves them vulnerable. This said, Iâve just got a feeling Man City are going to be absolutely mint, and Chelsea will not be far behind. Unfortunately for Arsenal, I see them finishing a rather distant 4th, and so ending âThe Processâ.",
      "2) Man United will be very, very good â Amorim clearly has something about him. Yes, heâs hellbent on his system, but every time he speaks, I listen (and no, Iâm not âMan Yooâ). You canât 100% rule out Cunha having a âCantona Momentâ and ending up in the crowd with his studs deep in someoneâs neck, however you also canât rule out him being utterly fabulous. He was just born to be a United player, wasnât he?",
      "3) Sticking with matters at Old Trafford â Either Vardy or Calvert Lewin will sign on a free, late in the window on a 12-month deal.",
      "4) Glasner will not be Crystal Palace manager at the end of the season â Clearly there are some frustrations with regards to recruitment at The Dogtrack (yes, I still miss you, Ted, Beard and Co.), and Glasner is also in the last year of his contract. A sticky start for Kompany at The Alianz, and itâs next-stop Munich for Olly G.",
      "5) Brentford could be many, many different kinds of f*cked â No explanation necessary, and still wishing you the best of luck, Keith.\nLeeds or Sunderland (or both) to stay up â I genuinely think Farke is a very good coach, and I think Sunlunâ have easily spent the best money of the three promoted teams. Given my previous comment regarding Brentord, and also with a slight worry for Wolves, I donât think itâs out of the question one of, or even both Leeds and Sunlunâ survive (just). But what of Burnley I hear you ask, wellâ¦â¦..",
      "6) Burnley to finish bottom and without Parker â Yes, they were promoted at a canter, but as long as Iâve got a hole up my ar*e, Scott Parker is not a Prem manager.",
      "Of course, now Iâve said all that, Arsenal will win the Prem and CL double, United will finish 15th (again) and Burnley will finish 11th (just above Palace, becauseâ¦â¦ well, Palace) with Parker wining manager of the Season. Either way, itâs nearly time and I for one, canât f*cking wait.\nAndy FTM (I know Iâll regret saying this after he gets sent off for the 11th time on Boxing Day, but Granit Xhaka might just be the best Â£13 mil ever spent)",

Clearly, he also had a plan to beat Liverpool and, in something that vindicates one of my opinions if not one many others would share, it involved Virgil van Dijk. A lot of people would understandably force play away from the Best Defender in the World, but that is to buy into the hype instead of seeing with your own eyes.",
      "For the past few seasons, van Dijk has been repeatedly guilty of ball-watching and many of the goals Liverpool concede, particularly against counter-attacking sides, come as a result of this.",
      "For the first goal, van Dijk is supposed to be marking Jean-Philippe Mateta, but leaves him to lunge in at Sarr without getting the ball. There was no need to make that tackle, had he simply held his position in the line Sarr would not have been able to shoot. For the second goal, he is not the only Liverpool player suckered in. When Wharton receives the ball, van Dijk is isolated two on one by Mateta and Sarr, but is actually covering neither of them because he is only looking at the ball. Taking a couple of steps towards Wharton gives the Palace man enough time and space to realise Sarr is completely unmarked. If van Dijk holds his position in the defensive line, there is significantly less chance Palace score.",

Iâve no idea why someone would deliberately interrupt a tribute like that and canât quite believe it has happened. Thereâs been very little ill will between Liverpool and Crystal Palace over the years, something underlined by those fan groups encouraging people to support the silence (and by Liverpool and Everton fans singling out Palace for their absence of poverty chants), I donât know why youâd want to change that.",
      "* Speaking of ill will with Liverpool, we come to Notts âNottinghamâ Forest. Again, itâs weird that a club without a history of being rivals with Palace should celebrate defeat at the CAS with the combined glee of winning the European Cup with Brian Clough and seeing Derby County getting relegated. Then again, despite the constant reminders in West Bridgford and beyond, we are a long way removed from that era of Forest. Towards the end of last season they were a bit like a Roy Hodgson team, blessed with some superb attacking talent but not really doing a lot of attacking, and not scoring many goals. How much longer thatâs tolerated by their notoriously calm, measured and patient owner remains to be seen.",
      "Forest fans have really shown their arse the past few weeks. Smugly saying ârules are rulesâ throughout Palaceâs legal challenge, conveniently ignoring the rules they broke in open and shut fashion over the previous couple of seasons and complained like hell about being punished for. Palaceâs challenge did have merit even if it was unsuccessful, although if history has taught us anything about Forest supporters is that they arenât that keen on standing up to the authorities, or solidarity with others.",

It wouldnât be Chelsea if there wasnât some sort of squad overhaul ongoing, but the players they do have are more than capable of winning the game.

      "I love hot takes, just as much as I love hot cakes (and thatâs a lot), and myself, Paches, Keef, Chazztopher, Micki, can all bellow out that Beckenbauer wasnât world class, Antony would be World Class if heâd just be given the right service, Saka is bang average, or all football is barely watchable since 1997, but removing absolutely all individual opinion from the conversationâ¦",

Iâll admit, Iâve actually had my heart-rate increase this week when discussing some of the wilder takes (probably the cakes, mind but still) but on reflection, I realised the problem was that my definition of world class is about inclusion and so because of that it became personal to me that someone would think Paul Gascoigne wasnât a world class footballer, not because I care about Gazza, (though I do, god bless him) but because I will never not feel that moments of magic are just as important as rote consistency in our game.",
      "To try to restrict who is world class, who is bargain bin, who is bang average, and who is Lee Cattermole, when definable boundaries are not clear, is to deflect yourself onto the discussion. Those that disclude goalkeepers clearly donât value what a goalkeeper can do, but also might be fair to say are risk averse individualsâ¦ the kind who at 5 a side belts up the pitch, loses the ball then just turns and watches as his 4 mates get torn apart by his failings and shrugs. Those that want 300 players to be World Class are the intelligent ones whoâ¦ I kid, obviously, but I am aware my desire to be inclusive shows a large part of my lack of standards. The fact I genuinely think the impressive careers of Milner and Barry, great as they were, havenât left the same cultural impact on football that say, the short careers of Wilshere or Dele didâ¦ (now THATâs a hot take.)",
      "So for my part, while I remain resolute that âmyâ version of World Class is one that is more inclusive of the deficiencies of football (after all, what IS a perfect footballer?*) and allowing of bad days, I do want to make it clear that I appreciate some donât like to colour outside the lines, or hear a bum note in a live album, and I am here for it, for it is our differences that make our sport what it is.",

      "Yes, itâs âonly the Portuguese leagueâ and no, heâs not the next Bas Dost. Weâre not expecting Erling Haaland numbers from Gyokeres, but weâre still backing him to be a success at the Emirates.",
      "MORE:Â Gyokeres to Arsenal: Bruno Fernandes second as Liga Portugal to Premier League signings ranked",
      "",
      "6) Rayan Ait-Nouri (Manchester City)\nPep Guardiola has signalled a readiness to tweak his defensive set-up with the Â£31m signing of Ait-Nouri from Wolves. The Algerian international is more naturally a wing-back, but weâre confident in his ability to hold his own as an out-and-out full-back.",
      "Thatâs the role heâll play at Man City, especially after the left-back spot has been consistently filled by centre-backs. Guardiolaâs rotation policy means Josko Gvardiol will still start games there, but his move to left-centre-back could be the most significant outcome of the Ait-Nouri signing.",
      "The former Wolves man boasts 24 goal involvements in 135 Premier League appearances, and his attacking instincts certainly add an edge to a City side that underwhelmed in 2024/25.",

What PSR? Eight Premier League sides in 10 biggest spenders of summer 2025\nðÂ Ten brilliant players âtoo oldâ for a transfer in an ageist Premier League",
      "",
      "5) Martin Zubimendi (Arsenal)\nZubimendi has looked very promising in pre-season, with Mikel Arteta delighted to build his team around the Spanish defensive midfielder as his anchor. He should help Martin Odegaard get back to his best and now Declan Rice can relax, knowing that his full-time position is further up the pitch, providing support for Gabriel Martinelli on the left.",
      "The ex-Real Sociedad star looks like the calming presence every top team needs in the middle of the park. He might not reach Rodriâs level, but he can reach Rodri levels of influence on this Gunners side.",
      "",
      "4) Bryan Mbeumo (Manchester United)\nThereâs one glaring issue with this transfer: This Is Manchester United Weâre Talking About. They have a habit of botching signings, no matter how brilliant the player was before taking the graveyard shift at Old Trafford.",
      "We want to love this signing. Mbeumo fits Ruben Amorimâs system perfectly. But this club, man. If the ex-Brentford star ends 2025/26 with three goals after scoring 20 last term, we wonât be shocked. But for now, credit where itâs due. On paper, itâs an excellent deal for United.",
      "",
      "3) Matheus Cunha (Manchester United)\nAnother great player that Manchester United might destroy. Cunha was exceptional for Wolves last season and now finds himself slotted perfectly into Amorimâs system as a left-sided âwide 10â.",
      "He and Mbeumo offer something United have been lacking: actual output. Now they just need an elite centre-forward. If they get that piece, top-half football might actually be on the cards. High hopes, we know.",
      "Itâs hard to see Cunha struggling. Heâs very, very good at football. But we do fear for him. Because, you know, lads, itâs Man United.",
      "MAILBOX:Â Man Utd have signed another âknob-endâ in Mr Walky McWalkface",
      "",
      "2) Tijjani Reijnders (Manchester City)\nNico Gonzalez didnât automatically become the best midfielder in the world after his big-money January move, so Man City went out and signed Reijnders from a Milan side without Champions League football next season, and what a bloody signing he is.",
      "The Dutchmanâs arrival was necessary after Kevin De Bruyneâs departure, while Mateo Kovacic and Bernardo Silva are not getting any younger. Reijnders is a different type of midfielder to De Bruyne, but he brings an elite ability to carry the ball up the pitch and combines relentless energy with superb technical quality.",
      "Itâs hard to find a downside. City could be utterly unstoppable again in 2025/26.",
      "",
      "1) Florian Wirtz (Liverpool)\nA lot will be made of the Â£100m transfer fee Liverpool paid, and every single Florian Wirtz touch will be forensically analysed by people whoâve never seen him play before now. Because thatâs what really matters â not that the Reds have signed one of the best attacking midfielders in the world, and someone whoâs world-class at just 22.",
      "The club-record fee was almost enough for Wirtz to drop a place or two here, but purely from a footballing perspective, this comfortably looks like the best signing of the summerâ¦so far.",
      "READ NOW:Â Florian Wirtz value exposed by quarter-price Rayan Cherki in seven damning stats",
      "Arne Slot said Liverpoolâs huge moves in the transfer window this summer have been justified by player sales, suggesting the club has done nothing new.",
      "Chelsea and Liverpool have both found value in the transfer market by underpaying for a couple of players each, while Arsenal have a bargain of their own.",
      "Liverpool and Arsenal are in âdo or dieâ seasons for very different reasons as Mikel Arteta faces becoming âthe new Brendan Rodgersââ¦",
      "Florian Wirtzâs father has revealed why the player snubbed interest from Bayern Munich to join Liverpool.",
      "Liverpool breaking the British transfer record twice to sign an elite striker and creator is âunthinkableâ but means they should be judged by the Quadruple.",
      "A Liverpool fan does not think the Reds are firm favourites for the Premier League title due to four concerns, with Florian Wirtz the ânew Kai Havertzâ."

      "Rashford also discussed which managers have been the most influential in his career - citing Louis van Gaal, Jose Mourinho and Ole Gunnar Solskjaer as inspirations - but he left out Amorim and his predecessor Erik ten Hag.",
      "The forward also went into detail about Mourinho's desire to win at United - irrespective of how well you played.",
      "\"They're different but because we've had so many different managers, it's impossible for me to compare [them],\" added Rashford.",
      "\"Up until Jose, I never had a manager who was so fixated on winning. Van Gaal was fixated on winning but he wanted to play a beautiful style of football. Jose didn't care.",
      "\"Of course, if he could choose, he would want you to play well, but if you win, you win and move onto the next game. He had this attitude.",
      "\"And it was confusing for me as all the way through my development at United, it was about playing a certain style and winning in a certain way.",
      "\"And in the beginning I was angry all the time - because we had not played well and we won. But because we won and he is a manager who is just a winner, he didn't bring up the points that you know were missing from that last game. Because we've won.",
      "\"But when we lost, he would bring up the points then. After six months, I learned to respect it and reap the rewards from him as a coach.\"",
      "Rashford also discussed the importance of the move to Barcelona on his chances of making England's World Cup squad next summer.",
      "The 27-year-old was named in new head coach Thomas Tuchel's first Three Lions squad back in March - but missed the June camp due to injury.",
      "\"I try not to put too much pressure on the England set-up,\" said the Barcelona forward. \"It's clearly something I want to do.",
      "\"But you don't get that without putting in the hard work just day in, day out. And showing the hard work on the pitch. That's a knock-on effect to the stuff I'll be doing day in, day out.",
      "\"This current group of English players is extremely talented, it's going to be disappointing if we don't manage to go on and do something really special because I think we've come on a lot. For the last few years, it's been: the next step is to go on and win.\"",
      "Rashford also paid tribute to his former club Villa - saying the brief spell at Unai Emery's side went \"exactly how it was supposed to be\" after struggling at United.",
      "\"The timing of me going to Villa, now looking back, it was the exact time for me to do something like that,\" he said. \"The response and reaction of what I got from the people at the club and the fans, it was what I needed in that moment.",
      "\"Six months on, I feel like everything is completely different. Everything I did at Villa, apart from the injury at the end, was exactly how it was supposed to be. The club's on the up so the atmosphere at the club in that dressing room was positive.\""

      "Now, whether they are academy graduates or new signings, the next wave of young stars are ready to make their mark in the top-flight.",
      "These are the players we think are Next Up.",

      "Rio Ngumoha has emerged at the perfect time for Liverpool following Luis Diazâs departure to Bayern Munich this summer.",
      "With an opening on the left wing, the 16-year-old has grabbed his opportunity in pre-season with both hands.",
      "He provided an assist against AC Milan, scored a stunning solo goal in the win against Yokohama F. Marinos and took just five minutes in the game against Athletic Club to claim a goal and assist.",
      "Despite only being at the early stages of his career, Ngumohaâs bravery on the ball and technical skills mean he has placed himself firmly in contention for Premier League minutes this season.",
      "The club rate the young talent, who was signed from Chelseaâs academy in 2024, highly, and with Diazâs exit set to provide him with more minutes in his favoured position on the left, he has the perfect opportunity to thrive in Arne Slotâs side.",

      "Manchester United supporters have had a brief glimpse into what Chido Obi can produce â but this is just the start.",
      "The 17-year-old forward was thrust into the Old Trafford limelight last season as Ruben Amorim desperately searched for goals with both Rasmus Hojlund and Joshua Zirkzee struggling in the final third.",
      "Despite pressure being heaped on the young talent â who left the Arsenal academy in 2024 â Obi showed flashes of what he can offer at the highest level.",
      "Two goals on Unitedâs post-season tour of Asia, followed by two more while on international duty with Denmarkâs U20 side, will see Obi come into the new season full of confidence and eager to impress.",
      "United have recruited well in forward areas with Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and now Benjamin Sesko arriving through the door at Old Trafford.",

      "By Laura Hunter",
      "Wednesday 13 August 2025 16:54, UK",
      "No 9s and No 10s have been the talk of the summer and big money has been spent in the pursuit of goals.",
      "Chelsea are hanging their hopes on Liam Delap and Joao Pedro, Arsenal have got all their eggs in the Viktor Gyokeres basket, while Man United have gone wild and revamped their entire forward line by signing Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko for a combined Â£207m.",
      "Liverpool have front-loaded, too, splashing a nine-figure sum on Florian Wirtz before pushing overall spending beyond the Â£250m mark with a Â£79m outlay on Hugo Ekitike.",
      "And we are yet to reach a conclusion on the Alexander Isak saga, with any potential fee for the Newcastle forward likely to eclipse anything we have seen so far. So, who has spent wisely? And how will each team best utilise their new weapons in the hunt for Premier League glory?",
      "After their worst season in 51 years, the only way is up for Man United and their shiny new three-pronged attack, moulded in the shape of Ruben Amorim's famous 3-4-2-1 system.",
      "Amorim always maintained, given the choice, he would not have taken on the unenviable task of awakening English football's most successful club from its decade-long malaise midway through a season, had the proposal not been 'now or never'.",
      "What followed was fairly disastrous: most defeats (18), fewest points (42) and fewest goals (44) in the club's Premier League history. But now, with a full pre-season to impart his particular style and the tools with which to make it succeed, can we expect an upturn?",
      "Mbeumo and Sesko are exciting additions. Both had offers from other clubs and still chose Man United, despite no participation in European competition for the first time in 11 years and no title since 2013.",
      "Sesko hit 21 goals in all competitions for RB Leipzig last season, finishing with 39 in 87 appearances overall. His pace, movement and sharp finishing should suit Amorim's fluid attack, with Mbeumo and Cunha doing the creative work.",
      "Some daunting early fixtures, with Arsenal, Manchester City and Chelsea in their opening five games, will stress test that theory. Clearly all three have proven pedigree - each is an obvious improvement on the luckless Rasmus Hojlund - but whether they offer the right balance of creativity to goal threat will have to be judged at a later date. Suffice to say, 44 is not a difficult tally to beat.",
      "Most believe both Wirtz and Ekitike to be the real deal despite their relatively modest ages. The latter scored 15 goals and assisted eight more in 33 Bundesliga games for Eintracht Frankfurt last season, while Wirtz just makes playing football look frightfully easy.",
      "Over the last two years, the German international landed 67 goal involvements in 75 matches across all competitions for Bayer Leverkusen, with an equally efficient split of 34 goals to 33 assists.",
      "Both are model forwards for fast transitions and have an ability to play between the lines, ready to complement Liverpool's already abundant attacking riches. Mohamed Salah's eyes must have lit up when Wirtz walked through the door at Melwood - a quick, skilful, progressive playmaker with shades of Kevin De Bruyne? Yes please.",
      "In Arne Slot style, expect aggressive counter-pressing too.",
      "Chemistry between Wirtz and Ekitike already shows outstanding promise. This is an ominous development in the evolution of Slot's incumbent champions.",
      "Let's be honest, Arsenal have been fudging it for years, somehow managing to get away with scoring enough goals to satisfy consecutive second-place finishes thanks to the brilliance of Bukayo Saka and Martin Odegaard. Not nearly enough for a title, though.",
      "Every transfer window teased a big-name signing without ever actually delivering on that pledge. Until now.",
      "Gyokeres \"will destroy defenders\", insisted Mikel Arteta last weekend. Perhaps the fact he has been given Thierry Henry's iconic #14 shirt is intentionally foreboding. Like the legendary Frenchman, Gyokeres thrives within the width of the posts. He has a desire to stay on the last line, complete with intimidating physicality and running power.",
      "A forward who can charge through defences and speed up attacks - scoring 23 times from fast breaks last year - will aid Arsenal's plight greatly. And most importantly, no player in Europe's top eight divisions matched Gyokeres' 39 league goals for Sporting.",
      "In fact, across his two seasons in Portugal, Gyokeres hit Erling Haaland-level numbers: 79 goals in 83 matches in the Primeira Liga and Champions League, proving he might very well be the missing piece in Arsenal's title-chasing dream.",
      "Chelsea's willingness to part with big sums of cash has been a transfer market staple ever since Todd Boehly took a controlling stake at Stamford Bridge just over three years ago.",
      "In the immediate aftermath of the introduction of the Premier League's PSR rules, they were the only club keeping the magic of the transfer window alive. Now others have caught up, but we still thank Boehly for plugging the intrigue gap.",
      "And yet Chelsea's latest spree is more interesting still, as newcomers Delap and Pedro jostle for first-choice striker. The Brazilian is arguably more mobile and dynamic than Delap, but has struggled to stay injury-free over the past 12 months.",
      "His versatility across a fluid frontline will nevertheless be helpful to Enzo Maresca, who could use Pedro as a second striker behind the former Ipswich target man if he so wishes - or even on the wing.",
      "Delap, meanwhile, has already shown himself to be a good ally to Chelsea's greatest asset, Cole Palmer. The pair were prolific for Manchester City's youth teams in years gone by.",
      "Pedro and Delap, both on the scoresheet as Chelsea thrashed AC Milan in a recent pre-season friendly, registered a combined 30 goal contributions in the Premier League last season (22G, 8A) and that kind of firepower can sustain a meaningful title charge - at least beyond Christmas, which is realistically where Chelsea's ended last term.",
      "Pep Guardiola professed not to want wholesale change at Manchester City midway through last season's disastrous collapse, but that appears to be what he's got. City went big in January and have invested further this summer.",
      "Rayan Cherki has drawn most excitement, not least because of comparisons with one Lionel Messi - which may have as much to do with his short stature as his impressive close ball control, but any association with the great Argentinian has got to be deemed favourable.",
      "A Messi-like ability to open up a game is what was captured in glimpses for Lyon last season, particularly noticeable in Europa League performances, with 12 goal contributions from 11 starts.",
      "Of course, City do not need another marquee No 9 signing, they have Haaland, who will be buoyed by the addition of Cherki to supplement his own goal-scoring habits as City bid to forcibly reassert themselves back in the title picture. Things just got interesting.",

      "Super 6 returns this Saturday - Â£1,000,000 'TIL IT'S WON!",
      "A look at the betting provides such evidence. Rarely do you see a major league with FOUR teams priced up in single figures with Liverpool (13/8), Arsenal (2/1), Manchester City (3/1) and Chelsea (8/1) all taking up a huge percentage of the market.",
      "Liverpool have gone again from a position of strength, signing potentially the most exciting creative talent on the planet in Florian Wirtz, Man City have rolled the dice in the market to try and start their new legacy, Arsenal have got their centre forward and Chelsea, who were 20/1 shots before the Club World Cup, have shown in the summer against Paris Saint-Germain they have the talent and mettle to compete with the best.",
      "Rest assured, the 12 fixtures involving both of those teams will be ones to savour and already look to have six-pointer vibes about them. Box-office stuff.",
      "Centre-forwards are back in fashion. And the best in the world are strutting their stuff down the Premier League catwalk.",
      "This should have a positive impact on the league's goals output.",
      "Chances were being created last season but not taken. The 2024/25 season saw more \"big chances\" missed than any other Premier League season. That figure was at 1201 in total as the average goals per game dropped from 3.28 in the 2023/24 campaign to 2.93 last season.",
      "Spending on new players by Premier League clubs is approaching Â£2bn with still a couple of weeks left on what has been a meaty summer transfer window of action.",
      "Manchester United secured their man to spearhead Ruben Amorim's system by splashing the cash to lure striker Benjamin Sesko. He is full of power, can receive and hold up the ball to an elite level, loves a shot and is a nuisance for defences with constant runs in behind. Viktor Gyokeres did all of these things and more at Sporting under Amorim and he now has the pressurised task of being the missing piece of the puzzle for Mikel Arteta at Arsenal.",
      "There's also the excitement about Hugo Ekitike at Liverpool, who without question has the ceiling to go to another level in the Premier League. Already quick and skilful, he showed in the Community Shield his finishing and all-round game has already developed. Throw Alexander Isak, Matheus Cunha, Erling Haaland, Omar Marmoush, Cole Palmer and Mohamed Salah into the mix and you've got yourself a league that guarantees goals.",
      "Blink and you'll miss it. Taking your eyes off a Premier League game at any point isn't recommended as this league is now the place to watch intense, counter-attacking tactics. Teams are happy without the ball and springing into devastating transitions.",
      "This switch of style has been a trend taking over the Premier League in recent seasons. In the 2018/19 season there were 389 fast breaks (OPTA term for counter-attack) recorded. That figure rose to 775 last season. It's almost doubled.",
      "Of those 775 fast breaks, 112 of those ended with a goal being scored - that's 31 more than was scored in the 2023/24 season.",
      "The best team at it? Champions Liverpool, who with Salah to the fore recorded 52 shots and 14 goals scored from fast breaks. The best numbers by a team in any Premier League season over the past seven years.",
      "Pep Guardiola has seen close up how his Manchester City team have fallen behind in this stylistic change. His possession-based game, centred around control and luring the opposition into making rash pressing decisions has become easier for teams to crack the code.",
      "Chaos is now embraced.",
      "The rise of quick and powerful wingers along with intense midfield play has played a huge role in City's recruitment. They are heading down that avenue with the likes of Jeremy Doku and Rayan Cherki.",
      "Seeing whether Guardiola can completely rebrand this Manchester City team and embrace such chaotic football is one of the most intriguing strands to this season where the counter-attack will surely be king again.",
      "The last two Premier League seasons have uncovered a worrying theme of the three promoted clubs being relegated straight back down to the Championship.",
      "So, it's unsurprising to see Burnley, Sunderland and Leeds head the relegation betting markets but things just could be different this year and anyhow is a sample size of two seasons really enough to make such a sweeping statement that the gap between the Championship and Premier League is impossible to bridge?",
      "You only have to go back three years or so to show that Brentford, Bournemouth, Nottingham Forest and Fulham have recently shown it can be done.",
      "And all these three teams coming up have something in common: they can build their home ground to be a fortress, something Southampton, Ipswich and Leicester failed to do, winning just six games between them.",
      "Turf Moor, Elland Road and the Stadium of Light are ferocious places for away teams when rocking. That could just be the difference this year and lead to a much more competitive relegation scrap as teams feeling safe in mid-table could be dragged into a serious scrap.",
      "The inability of Liverpool's closest title challengers to keep key members of their squad last season certainly played a part in Arne Slot's team running away with the Premier League.",
      "Tottenham, Manchester United, Manchester City and Arsenal all ranked in the top five when it came to value of players that missed minutes due to injuries last season. It's going to be unlikely that Liverpool will have such an advantage this season despite Slot being a master of rotating his squad and keeping his players relatively injury-free.",
      "An absence of a major tournament last summer has to bode well for players being fresher and more robust in terms of the avoidance of injuries. Just look at the form and injury record of Declan Rice, Phil Foden, Ollie Watkins, Cole Palmer and Bukayo Saka at various stages last season. All went through various degrees of form wobbles following their prolonged summer helping to guide England to the European Championships.",
      "The elite clubs should be able to get their big guns out in the pitch more this season which should mean Liverpool's advantage form last season in that regard is diminished.",
      "Carragher said: \"The Premier League is on completely different level to anything else in world football.\"",
      "And that is why an epic title battle awaits.",
      "See you all on Friday.",

      "They would consider offers of around Â£40m for the 22-year-old Denmark international.",
      "The Â£73.7m arrival of Benjamin Sesko from RB Leipzig is likely to limit Hojlund's game time for United moving forward if he stays.",
      "Hojlund was an unused substitute in United's pre-season friendly against Fiorentina on Saturday despite being the only recognised striker in the squad - he was the only first-team regular not to get on the pitch.",
      "Head coach Ruben Amorim opted to play Mason Mount as a false No 9 instead, telling MUTV afterwards: \"We struggled without a reference as a striker. We have a new player, so we'll see.\"",
      "Hojlund wants to stay and fight for his place, but it is now clear he has joined the likes of Jadon Sancho, Alejandro Garnacho, Antony and Tyrell Malacia as players United want out.",
      "Hojlund initially joined Manchester United from Atalanta for Â£72m in August 2023.",

      "The striker was unveiled before kick-off but unavailable to play.",
      "The 22-year-old has signed a five-year contract at Old Trafford, with Man Utd set to pay an initial Â£66.26m (â¬76.5m) with Â£7.36m (â¬8.5m) in performance-related add-ons.",
