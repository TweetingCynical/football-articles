      "Benjamin Sesko has been tipped to struggle at Manchester United with Louis Saha calling out his former club for not getting a creative midfielder through the door. Ruben Amorim spent more than £200million on reinforcing his frontline with Sesko, Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha all arriving.",
      "Sesko himself cost £74m, arrives with a huge reputation and has been tasked with leading the line at Old Trafford. The young Slovenian has been named on the bench for the three Premier League games so far, failing to score in any of his cameos, and Saha is fearful that he may struggle if he does not have the creativity behind him.",
      "United under Amorim play without a playmaker, instead having two central midfielders and two forwards to aid the No 9. Saha insists it is vital that Mbeumo and Cunha hit the ground running with Sesko needing that supply.",
      "“I think he’s capable if the manager managed to get that link between midfield and striker,\" said Saha. \"Unfortunately we didn’t get the midfielder we wanted. So we’re still very weak in that department. And this is why I think Sesko will struggle maybe a little bit until we get that sorted.",
      "“He’s got the quality because he’s tall, he’s going to score goals in the air, and he’s very technical as well. All his movement is right up there, so I’m very confident he’s going to get chances and he’s going to score.",
      "\"But to get us where we want, I don’t think that’s going to be on him. Those two playmakers, (Matheus) Cunha and (Bryan) Mbeumo, will have to kick on very soon, (otherwise) you will see Sesko struggling as well.”",
      "United had struggled in attack in their opening games. In their first two outings they only scored courtesy of an own goal before they hit three past Burnley with Mbeumo getting his first goal in his new colours.",
      "Saha has maintained that United have continued their worrying trend of relying on young, inexperienced strikers to lead their line. The struggles experience by Rasmus Hojlund are well documented. The Dane couldn't deliver on his price tag and has been loaned out after two years.",
      "The Frenchman now fears that the club have simply repeated the trick by signing Sesko who, despite being tipped for big things, is still only 22.",
      "He added, speaking to the Athletic:: “The problems identified over the last three or four years (at United) is having the responsibility as a number nine or as a forward when you’re young. You’re still learning, you’re making mistakes. You don’t how to connect with the players as much as maybe Bruno Fernandes, as much as (Zlatan) Ibrahimovic before, or players like Andy Cole.",
      "“There (was a) combination at Man United to have a young player with a lot of talents, who’s going to disrupt, who’s going to actually bring in unpredictability, but at the same time, you have experience where it’s very valuable and you’re going to actually pass on the information.",
      "\"This is not the case in the last three or four years. So it’s been a really big mistake and I think they’ve done it again.”",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Matheus Cunha claimed he'll \"be back soon\" after hobbling off during Manchester United's win over Burnley on Saturday with his injury sparking major concerns for Ruben Amorim. Cunha has been one of the more impressive performers for the Red Devils, despite their indifferent start to the season.",
      "The Brazilian signed from Wolves in the summer but has quickly settled in as he looks for his first United goal. However a hamstring injury saw him hobble off during the first-half at the weekend. Cunha was able to walk out of Old Trafford freely on Saturday night, giving those connected with the club hope that his injury was not as bad as was feared - and now the Brazilian has taken to social media to claim his absence will not be a long-term one.",
      "Having pulled out of the Brazil squad, he said: \"What an incredible environment, it’s great to be here. I’ll be back soon, always with joy and gratitude. Thanks for all the messages.\"",
      "Amorim was evidently concerned at the weekend with Mason Mount also a fitness concern. He said: \"It was hard to lose a player like Cunha and Mason Mount - Mount played like 30 minutes with an injury. I don't know [if they are long-term injuries], I don't know but I'm concerned about that. They are so important for us, so we'll see.\"",
      "United have four points from their opening nine league games but their next assignment is the derby against Manchester City at the Etihad. They will want a full squad if they are to head to the home of their neighbours, who have begun the year slow, and leave with a victory.",
      "Amorim has already underlined his admiration for Cunha and the impact he's made following his £62.5million switch from Molineux. The United boss hailing his competitive spirit and demands he puts on the squad to win.",
      "\"He’s a loud guy that’s really important in this moment,\" said the Portuguese coach. \"When he’s upset, you can feel it in the environment and that’s good. When you play some games and he loses, he’s a different guy, and that’s good. He has some characteristics that we miss last season, so I’m really happy with him and the other guys.\"",

      "It is nothing new to suggest that players who've headed to Manchester United for the past decade have generally looked less than the sum of their parts. It seems as if playing at Old Trafford sees individuals drop a level.",
      "A number of players have tried and failed to buck the trend, including some of the most expensive buys in the club's history. Manuel Ugarte is the fifth most expensive midfielder to sign for United and he arrived 12 months after being the subject of a transfer battle between Chelsea and PSG.",
      "The Uruguayan had impressed at Sporting Lisbon, playing under none other than Ruben Amorim. Several players have earned big moves after excelling with the Portuguese outfit.",
      "He failed to settle in Paris and he was signed by Erik ten Hag last summer, but a poor start for the Dutchman saw him sacked and so Ugarte was back working under Amorim. The man who had made him a player that some of Europe's elite were chasing.",
      "The new manager was confident their reunion would see Ugarte improve further. He said: \"All the Uruguayans I managed are incredible and that’s why I love them. Ugarte is a very talented boy and has a lot of room to grow. I am very happy to know that I have him back at Man United.\"",
      "Plenty in Manchester will have thought they had the ideal recipe to buck the trend of expensive arrivals falling well short of expectation. The current squad is full of players yet to deliver on their price tag and Gary Neville previously claimed that Old Trafford had become a \"graveyard\" for elite names.",
      "He said: \"I genuinely believe it's been a graveyard for every player that's joined that club in the last 10 years apart from Bruno. There's not one player joined that club that's improved apart from him. The rest of them, whether you go back to [Angel] Di Maria and [Bastian] Schweinsteiger, every player that's signed has gone backwards.\"",
      "But by Ugarte's own admission he is still not living up to standards with the hard-hitting defensive midfielder not delivering in an underperforming United side. He told El Observador: \"We haven't started the season very well. My level wasn't the best either, we have to be realistic and honest.\"",
      "Ugarte has found himself stuck on the bench throughout the year, coming on as a substitute for the first two games before he was left to watch on throughout the win over Burnley.",
      "The 24-year-old maintains that his relationship with Amorim remains a positive once despite him not being able to rediscover the form he showed at Sporting.",
      "He added: \"But I'm very confident, I have a very good relationship with the coach. I work well and I'm very excited and eager to earn a starting spot.”",
      "Ugarte is one of a number of signings made during the Ten Hag tenure who have failed to deliver on their fees, some already being pushed out the door. Antony headed to Real Betis, Rasmus Hojlund has gone out on loan. Now the latest set of recruits, the likes of Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko, will be determined not to feed Neville's narrative.",

      "United also need to make decisions over some of their out-of-contract stars. Maguire is their headline potential free agent.",
      "The England defender was signed for £80m from Leicester in 2019 but could leave for nothing. He has already expressed his hope of a new deal at Old Trafford.",

Rio Ferdinand won his sixth and final league title in 2012-13, as part of a strong English core under Sir Alex Ferguson, and believes compatriots Declan Rice and Harry Kane could have set United right in the years since.",
      "Since Ferguson stepped away at the end of that season, United have secured just five top-four finishes. They were distant runners-up behind Manchester City in 2018 and 2021, while last season's 15th-place finish was their worst in half a century.",
      "United have spent big in the last 12 years, breaking their transfer record in 2014 with a move for Angel Di Maria and again in 2016 when Paul Pogba rejoined the club from Juventus. Three of their 10 most expensive signings arrived in the window just gone, with Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko joining for a combined £200million.",
      "There have been plenty of expensive mistakes, though, and Ferdinand doesn't think Rice or Kane would have struggled in the way some have. Both have been linked with Old Trafford switches in the past, only for Rice to join Arsenal when he left West Ham in 2023 and Kane to trade Tottenham for Bayern Munich a few weeks later.",
      "Ferdinand described United's failure to sign Kane as their biggest mistake over the last decade. \"I think if they go and pay the number that Spurs want, they would have got him,\" he said during a conversation with Michael Owen on the Rio Ferdinand Presents podcast.",
      "\"And if we're to believe that, then I think if it didn't happen because of a couple of million here or there, I think it was a terrible decision,\" Ferdinand continued. \"I honestly think, I'll say this and I'm convinced, if United had gone and got Declan Rice and Harry Kane in that [summer 2023] window, Man United are in a different place now.",
      "\"Because it goes back to the environment, those two drive an environment. You've got two players who are salt of the earth type people, top pros.\"",
      "United did spend money in the summer of 2023, but not on Kane or Rice. Rasmus Hojlund was signed as the new main man in attack, but he has now been sent on loan to Napoli after two challenging seasons, while £60m midfielder Mason Mount has only just started to show what he can do after a tough time with injuries.",
      "Just 12 months after that, United paid another £200m on a raft of new signings, only for manager Erik ten Hag to get the sack in October. His successor Ruben Amorim has overseen another busy summer, and it remains to be seen whether his signings can help lift United back up to where they want to be.",

      "“When you have a club captain with an attitude like Fernandes, especially considering the previous leaders at the club that have been and gone, it’s slanderous to such a great football club. He’s very impetuous and childish. I can’t believe he’s never been sent off. If I was a referee, I’d book him every time he moaned or whinged.",

      "Former Manchester United defender Phil Jones believes teenage starlet Chido Obi should be ready to play a part for the first team this season. The arrival of £74m striker Benjamin Sesko may limit the youngster's opportunities, especially with United failing to qualify for Europe and suffering an early elimination from the Carabao Cup, but Jones still sees him getting chances.",
      "Obi joined United from Arsenal's academy last season and made his debut against Tottenham in February. He played eight times under Ruben Amorim, becoming United's youngest ever Premier League starter when he was named in Amorim's XI to face Brentford in May.",
      "Jones, however, feels the Danish Under-21 international is more than ready for senior football after rising through the ranks. \"When he was playing 18s football, it was men against boys. He was bullying people, it was so easy for him,\" Jones told Metro courtesy of FreeBets.com.",
      "\"I think he needs to understand where he is at in his head and figure out what his realistic expectations are. Is he going to play every game? No. Is he going be on the bench every game? No.",
      "\"But what he needs to do is make sure that when he is called upon, and there will be times he is called upon and he will get chances, that he is ready and happy. He has to be professional and be ready because if he is they will have one hell of a player.\"",
      "Obi has returned to United's Under-21 squad for the early part of the season, with Sesko and fellow new signing Matheus Cunha getting minutes in the No.9 role. The teenager has played three times in Premier League two, starting twice, and scored his second goal of the season to help defeat Manchester City last time out.",
      "United have allowed other strikers to leave on loan, with Rasmus Hojlund joining Napoli in a deal which could become permanent next summer and Ethan Wheatley getting minutes in League One with Northampton Town. Obi, however, has remained at Old Trafford.",
      "Jones' comments come after Denmark Under-21 boss Lars Knudsen made it known that he feels Obi needs regular football. \"I can't stand here and say anything about that, because it's somewhere else than with me,\" Knudsen said, as reported by Bold.",
      "\"It's just a hope we have for the national teams, because we know that playing time is crucial. This is both for performance, but also for these young people in terms of developing themselves. Of course, we hope that he will get somewhere where he can play.\"",
      "Obi wasn't part of Denmark's squad for the Under-21 Euros, where Newcastle forward Will Osula led the line. He is part of Knudsen's first squad for the upcoming break, though, along with United striker Hojlund's younger brother Oscar.",

      "For Manchester United, the summer transfer window was as much about clearing the decks as strengthening Ruben Amorim’s squad.",
      "After the arrivals of Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko, United’s focus shifted to offloading Amorim’s ‘bomb squad’, those players he had exiled and whose futures lay away from Old Trafford . Namely, Marcus Rashford, Alejandro Garnacho, Jadon Sancho, Antony and Tyrell Malacia.",
      "While United have made significant financial savings by jettisoning four of those five - Malacia still remains - in terms of wages and also recouped money in transfer and loan fees, they have taken a major hit on Antony, who cost £86milion but who joined Real Betis for just £21.5m.",
      "First out of the door was Rashford, who fell out of favour with Amorim a month into the Portuguese head coach’s arrival and who spent the second half of last season on loan at Aston Villa.",
      "The England striker, included in Thomas Tuchel’s latest squad, has gone on a season-long loan to Barcelona, who are covering all of Rashford’s £325,000-a-week wages, an impressive piece of negotiation from United to ensure full coverage of his exorbitant salary.",
      "Under the terms of the deal, Barca have the option of signing 27-year-old Rashford on a permanent basis for £30m at the end of the loan agreement, a fee which would represent pure profit on the balance sheet in complying with Profit and Sustainability Rules (PSR) because of his status as an academy graduate.",
      "The same is also true of Garnacho, who also fell foul of Amorim, after publicly criticising the United manager for dropping him for the 1-0 Europa Leage final defeat to Tottenham in Bilbao on May 21.",
      "From that moment on, Garnacho had no future at United, and was left off United’s pre-season tour of the USA, along with the other members of the bomb squad, and told to find a new club.",
      "While there was interest from a host of European clubs, including Napoli and Villa, Garnacho set his heart on a move to Chelsea, with United eventually agreeing a £40m permanent deal for the Argentina star, negotiating Chelsea up from their initial offer of £25m and again securing pure profit against the balance sheet because of his academy product status.",
      "Garnacho, who cost a nominal fee when he arrived from Atletico Madrid, became United’s biggest academy sale, his acrimonious departure ending his short-lived spell at Old Trafford and what at one stage promised to be a long and illustrious career at the Theatre of Dreams.",
      "Antony, arguably the most costly flop in United’s history, represented the biggest hit they took in the window, although the only grace was accepting a lower fee to ensure they did not have to pay the Brazilian winger a severance payment as part of his early departure.",
      "Sancho’s deadline day season-long loan move to Villa represented another nomadic chapter in the outcast’s wretched United career. Villa agreed to cover 80 per cent or Sancho’s £300,000-a-week wages and, with the completion of certain performance related clauses, United expect full coverage of his salary.",
      "That leaves full-back Malacia as the only member of the bomb squad to remain at United, although he can still secure a move - loan or permanent - to a league where the window remains open.",
      "United achieved most of their objectives with regard to the bomb squad, in terms of players sold and loaned out, as well as wage recovery. While Rashford and Garnacho came through the club's academy, Antony, Sancho and Malacia were signed for a combined £173m before wages are taken into account.",
      "Club sources say they maintained financial discipline in terms of the fees paid, and with regard to PSR compliance. Offloading the bomb squad continued United’s squad evolution, which was always going to take more than one window.",
      "With fewer fixtures in the absence of European football this season, Amorim always had to work with a smaller squad. Now he has the players in that he wanted and has got rid of those who were not part of his plans, there can be no excuses",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Emi Martinez claims he is “happy” despite missing out on a dream move to Manchester United. The Aston Villa and Argentina goalkeeper was expected to leave the Midlands this summer after a few stunning campaigns.",
      "He bid an emotional farewell to Villa Park at the back-end of last season and then featured heavily on United’s shortlist as they searched for a new goalkeeper. And while he remained an option late into the window, the Red Devils eventually opted for another player.",
      "They completed an £18m deal for Royal Antwerp’s Senne Lammens on deadline day. With the dust now settled, Martinez has spoken out for the first time.",
      "Having linked up with his Argentina teammates ahead of international duty, the goalkeeper shared a number of images of him in Argentina kit with the caption: “Feliz,” meaning ‘happy’, alongside an Argentina emoji.",
      "The reigning world champions are set to take on Venezuela and Ecuador over the next fortnight in qualifiers for the next World Cup. And while Martinez will be keen to focus on his national team commitments for now, Argentina legend Sergio Goycochea admits he has concerns for his mentality right now.",
      "“He’s a guy with a lot of personality, and all that stuff he puts to his advantage in a lot of situations that make a difference. We’ll have to see how it plays out for him right now. That’s the only thing that scares me.”",
      "Meanwhile, United legend Rio Ferdinand has suggested that he would have preferred his former club to make a move for Martinez instead of Lammens.",
      "“Speaking on YouTube, he said: “I just think his experience, he's got the personality, the character, plays for Argentina where the pressure is absolutely immense, he's won a World Cup, he was one of the reasons they won the World Cup, the save in the final, a big moments man.",
      "“Man United need as much personality as they need ability coming through that door and I think he fits the bill in that sense completely.”",
      "Once the international break is over, Martinez will hope to return for Villa. Marco Bizot has started in two of the club’s opening three games, with Martinez being between the sticks for the 1-0 defeat to Brentford.",

      "Former Premier League star Connor Wickham bagged a sensational strike from the halfway line as he searches for a new club. The former Sunderland and Crystal Palace forward struck just seven minutes into the clash between a PFA XI and Manchester United's under-21 side.",
      "Wickham, 32, was the star as a squad of 17 players made the trip to Carrington as they bid to maintain fitness and find their next team. Other Premier League figures such as Cyrus Christie, Rolando Aarons and Kazenga Lua Lua have been involved in training, while a game against Brighton's youth team saw ex-Arsenal forward Tyreece John-Jules and former Chelsea youngster Tariq Uwakwe play.",
      "And it will be Wickham's goal that lives long in the memory for anyone watching. The veteran forward claimed a loose ball after United's youngster's lost possession and touched it into the opposition area before letting go with a considered strike.",
      "Goalkeeper William Murdock was left scrambling back to his goalline but was unable to prevent the ball hitting the net. The effort was the standout moment of the match but Red Devils teenager Shea Lacey delivered an impressive, curling strike of his own to ensure the game finished level.",
      "Wickham will certainly have widened his reach with his latest strike however as he eyes a move in the football league. The ex-Ipswich Town and Cardiff ace is looking to return to action having went without a club last season.",
      "Wickham last played for Charlton after impressing during a two-week training period with the club in March 2024. The ex-England youth international scored one goal in four appearances for the Addicks before departing at the end of his short term deal.",
      "Wickham has led a storied career and played for 10 clubs since making his Ipswich debut having just turned 16. Sunderland paid £8million for his services in 2011 in a record fee for the Tractor Boys.",
      "The striker saw a series of loan spells to Sheffield Wednesday as he struggled to make a sustained impact at the Stadium of Light but earned Premier League player of the month honours in April 2014 to help the team avoid relegation. Wickham eventually moved on to Crystal Palace but saw his career grind to a halt after a serious knee injury kept him out of first team action for almost two years.",
      "The striker suffered similar misfortune after moving to Preston following his time at Selhurst Park. Wickham suffered a hamstring injury five minutes into his second appearance for the club and was released months into his deal.",
      "After just days as a free agent, Wickham move to MK Dons on another short term deal but lasted until the end of the season before joining Forest Green Rovers. Despite scoring nine goals in 20 games, Wickham departed at the end of another short-term deal, before short spells with Cardiff and Charlton.",

      "Betis eventually paid £21m to sign him after months of drawn-out negotiations. And while he eventually got his wish of a return to Betis, it appears that Antony could have gone elsewhere.",
      "He has suggested that Bayern Munich were interested in taking him to the Allianz Arena but he was only interested in a move back to Spain. Speaking to El Partidazo, Antony said: \"I spoke with Bayern Munich.",
      "“I don't know if it was [a] €7 million [offer], but I said I had Betis's word and that it was 95% certain and that I would respect my word. I feel comfortable making this decision because I'm very happy here. More than five teams called me.\"",
      "Antony will hope that he enjoys even more success with Betis during his second spell with the club. The 25-year-old scored nine goals and notched five assists in just half a season in Andalucia.",
      "Speaking at his unveiling as a permanent Betis player, Antony broke down in tears. He said: \"[Making the transfer happen] was very hard, but we're here now. I can't wait to wear the Betis shirt again. I can only thank everyone who made it possible.”",
      "He added: \"What a difference! Seville is more beautiful than Manchester. I'm finally here. I spent more than 40 days in a hotel; it was very hard, but everyone knew I wanted to return to Betis. Now with more time, there are so many things to do and achieve.",
      "“I had trouble sleeping after seeing so much love from the Betis fans; there were people waiting at my house at 2 in the morning.\"",
      "\"Being cared about is very important to me, it is something money can't buy. Here, I have had good feelings and felt lots of affection. It was always my first choice, and that's why I waited until the last day to return to Betis. Now I'm here and happy in a city and at a club that I love.\"",
      "While Bayern failed in their attempts to sign Antony, they still had an eye-catching window. The German giants completed a move for Liverpool wideman Luis Diaz earlier this summer.",
      "They also signed Nicolas Jackson on loan from Chelsea despite late drama over his future. The striker had flown to Germany to complete his move only for Chelsea to recall him following Liam Delap’s injury. But a deal was eventually agreed upon.",

      "It comes after question marks emerged over Andre Onana and Altay Bayindir's capabilities between the sticks. Bayindir faced fierce criticism following a blunder that handed Arsenal a 1-0 victory over United at Old Trafford in their seasonal opener.",
      "Plenty of United supporters will be hoping for a fresh start with a new No. 1, but Lineker and Shearer remain unconvinced that the 23-year-old is the solution to their problems.",
      "Speaking on The Rest Is Football, Lineker said: \"Manchester United have brought in a goalkeeper, Senne Lammens, from Royal Antwerp, who apparently made more saves than any other goalkeeper last season. That doesn't always mean what it sounds like it means; they might have just been a bad team at Royal Antwerp.\"",
      "Shearer added: \"Young for the situation that he has to go into. If he's going to go straight in there, that's going to be a big ask for him. What happened to the Emi Martinez deal? I don't know because he didn't play the other night, did he?",
      "\"Obviously, he didn't get the move that he wanted. So that's going to be a big ask for a young goalkeeper to go in there and start and perform.\"",
      "Lammens shipped 32 goals across 30 outings in Belgium's top flight for Royal Antwerp last season, managing an impressive seven clean sheets during the campaign. He was also crowned the division's Player of the Month twice and made 173 stops throughout the term - more than any other keeper across Europe's leading 10 leagues.",
      "After their opening day defeat to Arsenal, Amorim told reporters: \"I'm happy with the three goalkeepers. He [Bayindir] chooses to get the ball, but he's getting pushed. That is my feeling when I see the play.",
      "\"You choose to push a player [out of the way] or to get the ball in that moment. He needs to use his hands to catch the ball, not push players. He chooses to push players and let the ball pass.\"",
      "However, as the transfer deadline loomed, it appeared that the powers that be at Old Trafford had a change of heart, setting their sights on Aston Villa shot-stopper Emiliano Martinez. Despite the 32-year-old making his desire to join the Red Devils known, the board chose instead to sign Lammens, who is nine years younger than the Argentine.",
      "The Manchester United faithful will have to bide their time before they see Lammens in action, given that the Premier League is currently taking a breather for an international break. Supporters may, however, catch a glimpse of what the new face can do when the Manchester derby kicks off at the Etihad Stadium on Sunday, 14 September.",

      "United were dramatically dumped out of the competition last Wednesday after a penalty shootout defeat to the League Two side, following a thrilling 2-2 draw at Blundell Park. Grimsby raced into a 2-0 lead before Bryan Mbeumo and Harry Maguire struck back for the Reds, forcing the tie to penalties.",
      "In a nail-biting finish, Grimsby held their nerve to triumph 12-11 from the spot. United's £71m new boy Mbeumo missed the crucial 26th penalty to send the underdogs through to the next stage.",
      "Controversy arose on Tuesday morning when it was revealed that the EFL had slapped Grimsby with a £20,000 fine for fielding an ineligible player during the match. Clarke Oduor, ironically the only Mariner to miss his penalty, was not properly registered for the contest. Grimsby had missed the window to register Oduor by a minute, and duly self-reported themselves, admitting a clerical error by the club.",

      "The 24-year-old Stiller remained with Stuttgart, while his team saw the exit of former team-mate Nick Woltemade to Newcastle United. Stiller remains under contract until 2028 having made his name at the club after failing to break through at Bayern Munich, before moving to Hoffenheim.",
      "A return to Bayern is not on the agenda for Stiller at this stage of his career. Indeed the four-times capped star was not interested in a transfer at all during the most recent window.",
      "Instead Stiller's ambition is centred around playing enough football to earn a place in Germany's World Cup squad next summer. The player is in Julian Nagelsmann's current selection for qualifiers against Slovakia and Northern Ireland.",
      "\"I'm not currently thinking about moving,\" Stiller told Sport Bild. \"I've discussed it with my management that this is out of the question for me right now",

      "Discussing Kone with the MEN last November following a match against Huddersfield Town's senior squad, Binnion said: \"He's a high potential player, there's no doubt about that. His games to this point have been 20 minutes at Sunderland in a game we were poor in, 45 minutes in a game where we were completely dominant in Under-19s.",
      "\"To have his third game and his first start tonight, at that level, I thought for 20 minutes he was excellent. Then they get a little bit of pressure on him, it gets a little bit harder, it just shows he is learning where he's at and it's no problem.",
      "\"He's shown more than enough in the three games to suggest that with time and with work he's got a real chance of being a really good player, but it's a high potential Under-21s player with first-team potential, I don't think we can get too ahead of ourselves.",
      "\"He's come off injured tonight so will have to see the severity of that. He needs to get fit, stay fit, get a run of training and games and then we'll where he's at.",
      "\"It's just playing games, seeing pre-match and post-match sessions, analysis, translating them. You can see he can play the game and he's got real ability, it's just a run now and consistency and letting him learn and develop at his own rate.\"",
      "Meanwhile, MUFC TV pundit Liam Bradford likened the defensive midfielder to Kobbie Mainoo earlier this year, saying: \"He's quite similar to Kobbie Mainoo in that he can receive the ball in tight areas and get out of danger with a quick turn.",
      "\"He's having an impact all over the pitch, Sekou Kone. He's making an impact and stepping up in attack and defence.\"",
      "Fast forward to September 2025, and Kone has gained invaluable experience training with the United first-team, but Binnion believes that academy games are where the young talent will truly shine. Earlier this year, he said: \"A lot of [academy] players train with the first-team a lot because they're further along in their development. He does train with the first-team, but he needs to make sure he's developing his own game, so when he goes full time with the first-team, he's in the right space.\"",
      "Despite a challenging season last term, which saw Manchester United finish in 15th place in the Premier League, there's hope on the horizon for Ruben Amorim's side. The Red Devils were linked with Brighton's Carlos Baleba over the summer, but his £100m price tag proved too steep, especially after the board had already spent £200m on Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko.",
      "However, it seems United may already have their future midfield stars waiting in the wings, thanks to their renowned academy system. Youngster Mainoo has been turning heads since making his full Premier League debut under Erik ten Hag in November 2023, despite this summer's travails, and Kone could also be one to watch if he continues to develop at his current pace.",
      "However, Kone suffered a setback last month when he fractured his eye socket during an Under-21s match against National League side Tamworth. The injury led to him being stretchered off and hospitalised, and it's still unclear when he'll be able to return to the pitch.",
      "But if he can bounce back from this injury and continue to impress at academy level, he could find himself playing sporadically for the United first-team as early as this season.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "TalkSport's Jason Cundy is the latest person to call for Grimsby to be thrown out of the Carabao Cup for fielding an ineligible player during their historic win over Manchester United - but doesn't think the Red Devils should be reinstated.",
      "The League Two outfit enjoyed one of the best nights in their history as they stunned the Premier League giants, eventually winning 12-11 on penalties having led 2-0 earlier in the contest. However, a registration error surrounding Clarke Oduor has landed the Mariners in hot water.",
      "But rather than being kicked out of the competition they've been handed a fine and will be allowed to compete in the third round, where they face Sheffield Wednesday.",
      "Darren Bent is among those to call for Grimsby to be kicked out of the competition, claiming that if Oduor contributed in any way to halting United's ambitions, they should be punished. He said: \"You have to question Grimsby's place in the competition.\"",
      "Now Cundy has taken a similar stance and maintained that rules need to be adhered to - but that United should not get a reprieve with Sheffield Wednesday instead getting safe passage to the next round.",
      "He said: \"First off, if you break the rules like that I don't see how Grimsby can be in the competition, I genuinely don't. It sounds harsh but if that had happened the other way round, would we say 'nah its fine, £20,000 fine for Man Utd'. Are we now judging it by the lcub? they broke the rules, I'm sorry ,you have to leave the competition.",
      "\"I don't think Man Utd should get in either by the way. They got knocked out. What should happen now, whoever they're facing, they should get a bye. Grimsby should not be in the competition, if there's a law it should be the same for everyone.\"",
      "He went on to add: \"Sorry this sounds very harsh, but there's laws and rules for a reason, and if you break those the punishment has to be. We've just seen what happened with Crystal Palace.\"",
      "Oduor signed for Grimsby on loan from Bradford City the day before the match. He made his debut after coming on as a substitute during the second half, but would miss in the shootout, albeit it didn't cost his new side.",
      "It later emerged that he was registered just a minute after the permitted 12pm deadline on August 26. In a statement, the EFL has admitted that Grimsby reported the error themselves, and explained the punishment for the League Two side, which hasn't been universally well received by everyone.",
      "They said in a statement: \"The Club has since implemented several actions to prevent a similar occurrence in the future. The Club will be liable for the suspended sum of £10,000, if they were to again field an ineligible player in any League Competition between now and the end of Season 2025/26.\"",

      "Manchester United have signed a “huge talent” in Senne Lammens, according to Real Madrid and Belgium star Thibaut Courtois. Lammens became the Red Devils’ final signing of the transfer window on deadline day as he completed an £18m switch to Old Trafford from Royal Antwerp.",
      "United chose to pursue the 23-year-old to bolster their goalkeeping department over Aston Villa and Argentina star Emi Martinez. Despite that decision, one man who is a big fan of Lammens is Courtois, who has already shared his thoughts on the move with Rio Ferdinand.",
      "Speaking on YouTube, the United legend said: “He let me know about Lammens because he's a Belgian player, and he was just giving me the heads up as to what he's like.",
      "“He said he's a huge talent, obviously not experienced yet but he thinks his style will be well-suited to the Premier League as well. So that's a recommendation from probably one of the best three goalkeepers in the world, Thibaut Courtois, so I'll take that.”",
      "And while Courtois is a big fan, Ferdinand has concerns that Lammens might not be given the time he needs to reach his top form at Old Trafford. He added: “I keep seeing people talk about the talent and whatnot, but the problem is, can Man United afford to wait for talent to develop at this point in time? That's the question.”",
      "At just 23, Lammens has already made 63 appearances for Royal Antwerp and has worked his way up through the Belgian youth ranks - albeit he has yet to make his senior debut.",
      "Explaining why he chose to move to Old Trafford, he said: “This is my dream move. When I was five, United was at the height of football and you keep in your memory how big Manchester United is, so, when I heard they were interested, it was like a childhood dream.",
      "“I remember being a kid, Manchester United winning the Champions League and winning the league, and also [I want] to help the team get to a level that you can compete for a title again and to play Champions League again. That’s also one of my biggest points, that I want to grow with the team and go up to the heights that used to be Manchester United.",
      "“It’s one of the biggest clubs in the world and the Premier League is the biggest competition in the world.",
      "“In my team in Antwerp, there were some players who were also in England and, when I talked to them about Manchester United, you could directly see their face change. The club alone, the aura of the club, it’s massive, and being here today, seeing it, it’s a different level.",
      "\"It’s crazy. So, that was also a big part of why I chose Manchester United. I’m very happy that we could get it done today.”",

      "Paul Scholes overlooked Liverpool as he named Gianluigi Donnarumma to Manchester City as the standout signing of the transfer window. The Italy goalkeeper has joined Pep Guardiola’s side for a seemingly modest fee of around £27million, having fallen out of favour at European champion Paris Saint-Germain.",
      "Liverpool were the biggest spenders of the summer window, lavishing a record £446m on an array of talent such as Alexander Isak, Florian Wirtz and Hugo Ekitike. But it was the transfer of Donnarumma that caught the eye of Manchester United legend Scholes.",
      "The co-owner of League Two Salford City took to Instagram to post a picture of Donnarumma following his City move and wrote: “Donnarumma for £26m surely has to be signing of the window… obviously apart from the 14 Salford City have signed [praying emoji].”",
      "Given United’s goalkeeping issues, with Andre Onana and Altay Bayindir both making shaky starts to the season, Scholes wishes his former club had signed Donnarumma, who had been linked with a move to Old Trafford, but they signed Senne Lammens from Royal Antwerp instead.",
      "However, he believes it is a “strange signing” for Guardiola, who likes his keepers to be good with the ball at their feet. Scholes told The Overlap: “I think that’s a really strange signing for Pep. I love the keeper [Donnarumma], I think he’s brilliant and I’d have him at United tomorrow, today, whenever.",
      "“For £40m [the previously reported price for Donnrumma], he’s unbelievable. But for Pep, you’ve got to almost be able to play in central midfield as a goalkeeper.",
      "“I think that’s the reason [Luis] Enrique is getting rid of him at PSG, because he’s not great with his feet. I just don’t see him as a City goalkeeper.”",
      "Donnarumma replaces Ederson, who has left for Turkish side Fenerbahce after eight years at the Etihad. The 26-year-old said: “To have signed for Manchester City is such a special and proud moment for me.",
      "“I am joining a squad packed with world-class talent and a team led by the one of the greatest managers in the history of football in Pep Guardiola. This is a club every player in world football would love to join.",
      "“I have admired watching Manchester City for many years, so to now be able to play for the club is a huge honour and a privilege. I cannot wait to meet my new team-mates, the staff and the fans.",
      "“Playing at the Etihad Stadium will be very, very special for me. I am very excited for what lies ahead and can promise that I will give absolutely everything to try and help the club achieve even more success.”",
      "Donnarumma is set to displace James Trafford, who has started City’s first three matches of the season, two of which have ended in defeat. He could even make his debut in the Manchester derby at the Etihad on Sunday, September 14.",

      "Ex-Manchester United star Rio Ferdinand has given his verdict on his old club's summer transfer activity, rating it a solid eight out of 10. His high score for Ruben Amorim's dealings during the window was largely due to the players that United managed to offload.",
      "The notorious 'bomb squad', including Alejandro Garnacho, Antony, Jadon Sancho, Tyrell Malacia and Marcus Rashford, have all departed Old Trafford this summer.",
      "United also welcomed Belgian shot-stopper Senne Lammens to their squad on deadline day to take their total spend past £230m. The 23-year-old joins Benjamin Sesko, Bryan Mbeumo, Matheus Cunha and Diego Leon as United's fresh faces; however, Ferdinand stressed that selling was crucial to United's success and claimed it will have had a positive impact on the dressing room.",
      "On his show, Rio Ferdinand Presents, the former England centre-back said: \"I'm going to give it [United's transfer window] a 7.5, maybe an eight.",
      "\"I think I'll give it an eight based on the players they've got out of the football club because they had the potential to affect the ambience if they were hanging around. I think it's been a good decision from the club, good active work from the people behind the scenes.\"",
      "Sancho has followed in Rashford's footsteps by securing a season-long loan switch to Aston Villa, with Rashford having spent the second half of last campaign at Villa Park.",
      "Villa have agreed to pay 80% of Sancho's salary, though the arrangement includes achievable bonuses which should see his full wages covered during his stint in Birmingham. Sancho referenced Rashford when he was officially presented at Villa.",
      "He said: \"I spoke to him while he was here last season and I know he really enjoyed it. He said so many lovely things about the club, like how it's a family and you feel that friendly environment with great players and staff. I definitely felt that as I came in.\"",
      "Kobbie Mainoo and Tyrell Malacia were also strongly linked with late summer window departures but will now remain at United for the present. The latter saw a loan move to Elche fall through, though could still be shifted with the transfer windows in Turkey and Saudi Arabia remaining open.",
      "Aston Villa's Emiliano Martinez was also seriously considered by United as a goalkeeping option, with the World Cup winner even omitted from Unai Emery's squad to face Crystal Palace on Sunday evening.",
      "Nevertheless, the club chose Lammens. A late bid for Atletico Madrid and England midfielder Conor Gallagher also failed to come to fruition for United. Amorim's men have made a sluggish start to the season, but will take some consolation from Cunha's bright performances and Mbeumo netting his first goal at the weekend.",

      "Manchester United sent enquiries to sign a midfielder this summer, but they ended the transfer window without strengthening that area. Many have been left wondering whether that will be costly.",
      "United sources claim the midfield was never a priority because the club already had options that it views as strong and versatile.",
      "Bruno Fernandes, Casemiro, Manuel Ugarte, Mason Mount and Kobbie Mainoo are the options and Ruben Amorim must manoeuvre the first part of the season with his resources.",
      "Toby Collyer could have provided extra midfield cover, but Amorim allowed the youngster to join West Brom on a season-long loan after deciding he would not receive adequate minutes.",
      "Unless United reach the FA Cup quarter-finals this season, the 2025/26 campaign will see them play the fewest number of games in a season since 1914/15 (excluding seasons impacted by war).",
      "Although club figures say signing a new midfielder was not the priority because of their 'strong' options, it feels like a calculated decision was made based on fixtures and finances.",
      "United have just 16 Premier League games before the January window. The board has looked at Fernandes, Casemiro, Ugarte, Mount and Mainoo and decided there is enough there to roll the dice.",
      "There is also a belief that Sekou Kone could have a first-team impact before the end of the season. Kone did not play a single minute during the United States tour, but staff believe he could eventually contribute.",
      "It seems doubtful Kone will make any impact in the first half of the season, though. The youngster has been on the cusp of the first-team and needs more time in training to make a solid case to Amorim.",
      "Kone started for the Under-21s against Tamworth in the National League Cup last month and sustained a head injury. Kone was taken to hospital and the game had to be abandoned with no replacement ambulance available.",
      "The midfielder stayed in the hospital overnight but was discharged in the morning. Kone has been described as \"fine\" by a source and he will return to grass imminently, so he could possibly feature in behind-closed-doors U21 friendlies against the PFA and Aston Villa during the international break.",
      "United paid around £1million to sign Kone from Malian club Guidars FC. He was scouted with a view to progressing to the first-team and the deal was low risk considering the fee.",
      "Travis Binnion (Under-21 manager) also took French lessons, but Binnion credited Rowe with pushing particularly hard to learn a new language.",
      "Rowe was appointed in an academy player-coach role last year. Sources have said he is the best United have had in the hybrid academy position, which has previously been held by Paul McShane and Tom Huddlestone.",
      "Fans wanted a glimpse of Kone in pre-season in the USA. They felt he could show his talent and potentially make a case for first-team minutes, but Amorim did not use him in any of the friendlies.",
      "Kone still has a long way to go and has been on a steep learning curve since his arrival in England. He has been forced to put on muscle, get up to speed with the intensity and improve his positional understanding.",
      "Earlier this year, Binnion told the MEN: \"He’s a good player and we have high expectations for him, and any player we sign, you want to have those expectations, otherwise you go away and you aren’t signing a good player. You can see with the lads in the first-team, the level of expectation is high.",
      "\"But the reward is high and our lads have to be ready, maybe sooner than other big clubs, which is a real positive for players in the academy, but it’s hard, it’s not easy, is it?",
      "\"He has trained with the first-team quite a lot now, but as you can see tonight and the games he’s played recently, a big part of his development is the games.",
      "\"And it’s a healthier part of our first-team in that position, and the demands on that position are really high, whereas a forward player, they can maybe make more mistakes and experiment a bit more.",
      "\"The games are really important for them to get used to, the style of play, the intensity of English football and just for him to make better decisions day in, day out, in each of the games, whereas if he didn’t play games and only dropped in now and again, I think you’d see a slower rate of development.",
      "\"A lot of [academy] players train with the first-team a lot because they’re further along in their development. He does train with the first-team, but he needs to make sure he’s developing his own game, so when he goes full-time with the first-team, he’s in the right space.\"",
      "United hope Kone can improve quickly enough to contribute to the first-team this season. But Kone will not be rushed because he was signed last summer with the long-term future in mind.",

United fans were given reason for optimism at full-time when footage emerged online of the Brazilian walking freely outside Old Trafford.",

Speaking in his post-match media duties, Ruben Amorim admitted that he was worried about both Cunha and Mason Mount after they both picked up issues against Scott Parker's side.",

      "On the face of it, Manchester United have had a positive summer transfer window.",
      "After a season where they struggled in front of goal last term, United have transformed their frontline with the triple signing of Bryan Mbeumo, who has scored twice in the opening four matches of this season, Matheus Cunha and Benjamin Sesko.",
      "Diego Leon was signed with the future in mind at left-wing-back, while highly rated Belgian goalkeeper Senne Lammens was signed on deadline day to add much needed quality competition to the goalkeeping ranks.",
      "But one signing United didn't manage to get over the line was a new midfielder, despite heavy links with Brighton midfielder Carlos Baleba.",
      "As such, should Ruben Amorim remain in charge of the club next summer, a new midfielder is likely to be at the top of United's priority list.",
      "With that in mind, we have rounded up eight quality options who are currently set to be out of contract at the end of this season and will be available to sign for free next summer.",
      "The Barcelona midfielder has been a long term target for United, dating back to Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's time in charge.",
      "Since joining the Spanish champions from Ajax in 2019, the Dutch international has established himself as a key player for the club and has won six trophies in Catalonia.",
      "The 28-year-old is out of contract at the end of this season, though, and while he is expected to renew terms at the Camp Nou, an agreement hasn't yet been reached.",
      "The Uruguayan international played a key role in the Spurs side who beat United in last season's Europa League final and he already looks like he has a pivotal role in Thomas Frank's new look Spurs side.",
      "The 28-year-old is out of contract at the end of the season, though, and after joining Spurs from Juventus in January 2022, it remains to be seen whether he will be keen to explore a new challenge next summer.",
      "Goretzka may be 30 now but he is still a quality operator. The German international has won 15 trophies at Bayern Munich since joining from Schalke in 2018 and has started both league matches under Vincent Kompany this season, reiterating his importance to the side.",
      "He has spent his entire career in Germany, though, although there was speculation towards the end of last season over his future in Bavaria. His situation could be one to watch over the coming months.",
      "The twin brother of Arsenal defender Jurrien, Quinten Timber is carving out quite the reputation of his own.",
      "A Dutch international, the 24-year-old has won the Eredivisie and the KNVB Cup in Rotterdam with Feyenoord when Liverpool boss Arne Slot managed the club, and he has resisted interest from elsewhere this summer to have one more season at De Kuip.",
      "He could leave for free next summer as a result and is set to have a number of potential suitors for his signature.",
      "Neves has long been linked with a move to United but when he eventually left Wolves two years ago, he made a shock move to Saudi Pro League side Al-Hilal.",
      "The Portugal international has won the league title and the Kings Cup in Saudi Arabia but he could be free to explore a return to European football next summer.",
      "The 28-year-old will be at the peak of his powers then and would be an astute pick-up for any top side.",
      "Neves' midfield partner in Saudi Arabia is Milinkovic-Savic, who United also spent years courting when he was at Lazio.",
      "The Serbia international will be 31 next summer but could still be worth a punt on a short term contract, given his impressive performances out in the Saudi Pro League.",
      "Haidara has impressed at RB Leipzig for a number of years and has often been linked with a move to the Premier League. And if his contract situation in East Germany isn't resolved before next summer, he could be free to finally make that move.",
      "The 27-year-old Mali international played a key role in Leipzig winning back-to-back DFB Pokals in 2022 and 2023 and could be open to a new challenge.",
      "Kessie had a number of top European clubs monitoring his progress at AC Milan before he joined Barcelona in the summer of 2023.",
      "A year later, the Ivorian opted to make the move to the Saudi Pro League to join Al-Ahli and he was part of the side who won the Asian Champions League last season.",
      "Still aged 28, he will arguably be at his peak next summer and will have plenty of interested parties if his contract is allowed to run down.",

      "With exactly that in mind, according to Hasan Tuncel, via 61 saat, Trabzonspor have contacted United over a potential loan deal for Onana. He has also been offered to clubs in the Middle East",

      "O'Neil stabilised matters at Bournemouth for a campaign following Scott Parker's dismissal after a humiliating 9-0 thrashing by Liverpool in August 2022. However, when the Cherries chose to bring in Andoni Iraola rather than retain O'Neil at the conclusion of the 2022/23 season, the Englishman moved to Wolves.",

      "MEN Sport is under the impression that no replay or expulsion from the tournament is being considered.",

      "Toby Collyer could have provided extra midfield cover, but Amorim allowed the youngster to join West Brom on a season-long loan after deciding he would not receive adequate minutes.",
      "Unless United reach the FA Cup quarter-finals this season, the 2025/26 campaign will see them play the fewest number of games in a season since 1914/15 (excluding seasons impacted by war).",

      "Manchester United summer signing Benjamin Sesko has said it's a wish come true to sign at Old Trafford and believes he's getting better with each passing training session.",
      "Speaking to Slovenia’s Ekipa, he said: \"The level of the matches is certainly much higher, the players and teammates are also at a higher level. After all, English football is at the highest level in the world of football.",
      "“But I am very much looking forward to the coming period, also because I am getting better and faster in every training session, and I am also progressing in my football mentality every day.",
      "\"I wanted to move to England and fortunately my wish came true.\"",
      "Also discussing the upcoming Manchester derby, Sesko said: \"It’s true, it’s an incredibly big match coming up. There will simply be some pressure on both sides to just win this match. There’s still quite a bit to go until this match, but we’re definitely looking forward to a top-notch match.”",
      "According to the Dutch newspaper Het Laatste Nieuws in Belgium, as quoted by Sport Witness, Royal Antwerp were upset to discover that Senne Lammens had boarded a private jet to the United Kingdom before they had agreed terms with United.",
      "The report claims that the 23-year-old goalkeeper, who joined the Reds on deadline day, was 'theoretically not allowed to travel, but he did so anyway'. It's said that there was 'some resentment' within the club, having travelled without their approval.",
      "Antwerp finally reached an agreement with United when Lammens was airborne...",

      "Rio Ferdinand was pleased with United's business this summer. The Reds forked out £230m on Senne Lammens, Benjamin Sesko, Bryan Mbeumo, Matheus Cunha and Diego Leon.",
      "Ruben Amorim also managed to finally offload his 'bomb squad', with Antony, Alejandro Garnacho, Jadon Sancho, Tyrell Malacia and Marcus Rashford all finding new clubs.",
      "On his show, the United legend said: \"I'm going to give it a 7.5, maybe an eight. I think I'll give it an eight based on the players they've got out of the football club because they had the potential to affect the ambience if they were hanging around.",
      "\"I think it's been a good decision from the club, good active work from the people behind the scenes.\"",
      "Speaking on his latest YouTube video, Fabrizio Romano provided an update on United's unsuccessful approach for Conor Gallagher on deadline day. The journalist said: \"In the last 48 hours of the summer transfer window, Man United tried to sign Conor Gallagher.",
      "\"Man United considered the possibility to go for Conor Gallagher. It was not possible to make it happen, because Manchester United wanted to sign Gallagher on a loan deal, while Atletico Madrid already rejected a loan approach from Crystal Palace ten days ago.",
      "\"The top targets on loan for Palace were Conor Gallagher and Yeremy Pino. Pino arrived, Gallagher they tried to bring back to the club, he knows the club very well.",
      "\"But the answer from Atletico to Manchester United was no, no chance to that surprise proposal in the final hours of the summer transfer window. They tried for a midfielder, but no for the deal...\"",
      "Speaking to Spanish outlet Cope, Antony claimed he rejected an eye-watering offer from Bayern Munich to return Real Betis. The former United winger said: \"I spoke with Bayern, I don’t know if it was €7m (£6m), but I said I had Betis’ word and that it was 95% certain and that I would respect my word.",
      "\"I feel comfortable making this decision because I’m very happy here. More than five teams called me. Today will mark my life; it was very emotional, and I’ve never experienced that before.",
      "\"My family is very happy; it’s very hard to be away from them, and it’s been very hard being alone in the hotel for more than 40 days. My wife was waiting in Seville, and I told her my first choice was Betis.",
      "\"I was very moved seeing the affection of the Betis fans; I couldn’t get out of the car, so I ran out. It was a very nice party...\"",
      "According to TeamTalk, United and Chelsea are frontrunners in the race to sign Adam Wharton from Crystal Palace in the January transfer window. The report claims the two Premier League clubs have shortlisted the 21-year-old midfielder as a 'key target'.",
      "It's said that United and Chelsea view Wharton as a 'potential game-changer'. The former Blackburn Rovers playmaker sees his contract at Selhurst Park expire in June 2029.",
      "According to The Athletic, United recently considered signing Danny Welbeck from Brighton. The report claims that Erik ten Hag wanted to bring the 34-year-old striker to Old Trafford last year, but the Reds couldn't explore a deal due to hierarchy restructure.",
      "It's said that United tried again in the summer, and they were prepared to offer him a two-year contract. Welbeck has just entered the final 12 months of his deal at the Amex Stadium, making him available on a free in June 2026.",
      "Angelo Stiller has provided an update on his future at Stuttgart. Speaking to German outlet Bild, as quoted by SPORT, the 24-year-old midfielder said: \"I'm not currently thinking about moving.",
      "\"I've discussed it with my management that this is out of the question for me right now. I'm a regular and leading player here. The most important thing for my development is that I get my minutes – especially in a World Cup year. I definitely didn't want to jeopardise the World Cup.\"",
      "Stiller was linked with a move to United during the summer transfer window. The Germany international added: \"Basically, I'm attracted to moving abroad at some point.",
      "\"I thought Florian Wirtz's decision to go to Liverpool was cool. One thing is clear to me: At the end of my career, I absolutely want to play in the USA, in the MLS. This plan, this goal, is 100 percent.\"",
      "Ruben Amorim will be putting those still at Carrington through their paces over the next week or so as the Reds look to transform their fortunes. United were fortunate to end August with a win after a shaky start to the season.",
      "When Antony was unveiled to the media following his £21m move to Real Betis, the Brazilian was overcome by emotion.",
      "Describing his time at Old Trafford, Antony said: \"What happened in Manchester, only I know how difficult it was. I’m sorry. Training separately, but that’s part of life. I knew this moment would come. It’s in the past.\"",
      "The 25-year-old looked revitalised during his loan spell in Spain last season. He scored nine goals and bagged five assists in his 25 games for Betis.",
      "Jadon Sancho has explained why he joined Aston Villa this summer on a season-long loan.",
      "He told Villa TV: \"First of all, when I spoke to the manager, he gave me belief and confidence. He showed me the plan for this year, and it really inspired me. He definitely persuaded me, and I can’t wait to work under him.\"",
      "It has also been made clear that Marcus Rashford was an influence on Sancho's decision making.",
      "The Independent's Miguel Delaney has claimed that Romeo Lavia is emerging as a possible target just two years after his move to Stamford Bridge.",
      "Injuries have plagued Lavia's progress and have forced him to miss 73 games. According to Transfermarkt, hamstring injuries have been his biggest issue, keeping him out for 291 days. In total, Lavia has missed a whopping 490 days since moving to Chelsea.",
      "Unfortunately, muscle problems can become a constant issue for players. Right now, Lavia's injury record is enough reason for United to stay as far away from the midfielder as possible...",
      "Ruben Amorim's side looked to have switched their focus from Martinez to Senne Lammens late on. The Belgian goalkeeper was signed yesterday for £18m.",
      "Martinez was absent from Villa's clash with Crystal Palace on Sunday amid uncertainty over his future. Now, the World Cup winner must reintegrate himself into the Villa squad.",
      "Grimsby have been fined £20k after they fielded an ineligible player in their Carabao Cup victory over Manchester United.",
      "The Mariners' defender Clarke Odur was registered 59 seconds too late. The 26-year-old came on with 19 minutes to play and went on to miss his penalty during the shooutout.",
      "TalkSPORT host Andy Goldstein made his opinion clear when he said: \"Get rid of them. The competition is better with Man United, get rid of the little club. They shouldn't have broken the rules. It's not my fault.",
      "\"I want any club that breaks rules to be out. Get them out. Keep your fish and chips and get them out of the competition.\"",
      "Roy Keane has given his opinion on Manchester United's new £200m frontline following Ruben Amorim's opening few games.",
      "\"I think he'll [Mbeumo] be a hit. I like him. Too early to tell [about Sesko].\"",
      "Rio Ferdinand has highlighted a key issue in Jadon Sancho's loan move to Aston Villa this season.",
      "He told Rio Ferdinand Presents: \"Ain't Sancho's got an obligation to buy at the end of it? No? Oh, don't like that.",
      "\"I said this ages ago, if you're going to take massive losses on these players, take them. Just to get out. I don't think you can think about the financials too much if you're going to have them around the place and let them be a bad smell around the place. No, get rid. I don't care.\""

      "The loanees cover every level from the Championship to the National League as well as moves to Scotland and Switzerland.",
      "But it's perhaps telling that three prospects who could have departed on loan remain in situ at United.",
      "Gabriele Biancheri was linked with a host of clubs in the closing days of the window but has remained at Old Trafford while Sekou Kone and Shea Lacey are two other talented teenagers remaining in the Under-21 ranks.",
      "The decision to keep the trio in house points to the three being key performers for Travis Binnion's side this season as well as supplementing the senior training group.",
      "All three have been involved with the first team previously and Ruben Amorim could well call upon them again as the campaign continues. United are unlikely to rotate their side too much given the light schedule with no European football and an early Carabao Cup exit, but the likes of Biancheri, Kone and Lacey could be the next cabs off the academy rank if United need to promote from within.",
      "Lacey has showed his capabilities this week with a superb goal for the Under-21s on Wednesday and an assist in the Premier League 2 derby win over Manchester City last weekend. The 18-year-old has had injury problems but is now fit and firing and his talent is clear to see. He will likely emerge as a key player at Under-21 level this term.",
      "The same can be said of Biancheri who was linked with a loan exit to Welsh pair Newport County and Cardiff City during the summer window. The talented forward has trained with the Wales squad and is also eligible for Canada, who have made a play for his services at international level ahead of next summer's World Cup in North America.",
      "For Kone, the prospect has opened up of him having a say in United's midfield of the future.",
      "He started for the Under-21s against Tamworth in the National League Cup last month and sustained a head injury which resulted in the game being abandoned. He has recovered but has a long way to go and has been on a steep learning curve since his arrival in England.",
      "He has been forced to put on muscle, get up to speed with the intensity and improve his positional understanding. He did not play a single minute during the United States tour, but staff believe he could eventually contribute",
      "The Reds have been rapidly improving at academy level and there is plenty of talent ready to take the next step.",

      "Manchester United were busy in the summer transfer window with over £215million spent on four players. Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo, Benjamin Sesko and Senne Lammens were all brought in after the club's worst season in 51 years.",
      "Ruben Amorim's side were active in the transfer market until the last minute with Lammens arriving on deadline day. Up until the closure of the window, the possibility of a midfielder coming in remained a realistic opportunity.",
      "Despite the business that was completed, United have taken their time to switch on in the 2025/26 season. After losing to Arsenal on the opening day, the Reds drew to Fulham and narrowly beat Burnley.",
      "Mbeumo is the only one of the three new attackers to get on the scoresheet for United with Cunha suffering an injury last week and Sesko yet to start in the Premier League. Yet with Rasmus Hojlund returning to Italy on loan with Napoli, there is scope for a new centre-forward to compete with Sesko.",
      "And should United decide to dip back into the market for a new striker in January, they have the perfect squad number. Following Hojlund's exit, the famous No.9 is free and waiting for a new owner.",
      "Big names such as Andy Cole, Dimitar Berbatov, Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Romelu Lukaku have all worn the No.9 shirt in the past. Of course, there is the possibility that United wait until the summer to fill the spot.",
      "No.14 - previously worn by Christian Eriksen, Jesse Lingard and Chicharito - is currently available alongside No.17 after Alejandro Garnacho's move to Chelsea. No.20 has been left vacant after Diogo Dalot switched to No.2 and No.21 is also open.",
      "No.27, No.28, No.29, No.34, No.36 and No.39 are all numbers previously worn by first-team players that are yet to be picked up.",
      "In the summer, Casemiro, Tom Heaton and Tyrell Malacia could all leave the club at the expiry of their current contracts. That would free up No.18, No.22 and No.12.",

      "Alejandro Garnacho, promptly followed by Rasmus Hojlund and Kobbie Mainoo captured the imaginations of Manchester United supporters when they posed on the advertising hoardings after the former scored against West Ham United.",
      "The celebration was an imitation of Mohammed Kudus' celebration which he performed a couple of months prior against the Reds at the London Stadium. However, for United's fanbase, the image became iconic with the young trio who were said to be ushering in a new era at the Theatre of Dreams.",
      "Since Sir Alex Ferguson's exit, United had lost their way when it came to trusting youth over experience. Ageing player signings had become the norm in a desperate attempt to move the club back onto its pedestal.",
      "More often than not, the household names flopped and United were left in a bigger hole than they originally found themselves in. And yet, as this exciting young trio beamed for the cameras at Old Trafford, there was a renewed optimism that perhaps United were returning to a side built for the future.",
      "Fast forward a year and a half and the manager who gave the trio their breaks at United has been gone for nearly 12 months, the goalscorer has left permanently, another is all but gone for good and the sole survivor requested his own departure last week. How things change...",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "This iconic image is now tinged with sadness. Garnacho's exit from Old Trafford was on the walls from December but few could have predicted how far it capitulated in the final few months.",
      "Hojlund looked like he could kick on after his debut season but a horror second year put paid to that. All that remains from the image is Mainoo and surely the alarm bells are starting to ring for him now.",
      "Unlike his former teammates, Mainoo is a boyhood United fan and while he requested to leave OId Trafford towards the end of the window, he was only looking for a loan. Proof, if needed, that he still harbours hopes of making it at United.",
      "But if he is to do that, something drastic needs to change somewhere. The new United being built by Ruben Amorim is not one for sentimentality.",
      "Once a player is seen as not being the right fit anymore, they are out the door. Nobody could have envisaged Marcus Rashford leaving the club but even he is out now.",
      "United were keen not to let Mainoo go last week, perhaps due to the lack of competition it would have left for Bruno Fernandes. However, it is almost certain that the midfield will be the next area to receive an overhaul and when it does, it is unclear if the Stockport-born star will have a place in this new reality.",
      "If Mainoo was to look at that image during the international break, perhaps it would serve as a warning to him that he must either dig deep or face the consequences, like those he shared the hoarding with. Everyone of a United persuasion wants to see the 20-year-old succeed, even Amorim has admitted that, but that desire may not be enough to keep him around.",

      "As the dust begins to settle following the summer transfer window, Manchester United are now taking stock of the business that has been done and what is to come.",
      "In truth, it was a busier summer than many of us were expecting from the Reds, particularly after United lost the Europa League final. The attack has had a complete makeover while there have been plenty of outgoings which, for a time, did not look likely.",
      "But with us firmly in the midst of the first international break of the campaign, this is a great opportunity to take stock on the summer that was and the priorities we would have for the next few weeks. Here, MEN Sport has a go at managing United.",
      "The first port of call for Ruben Amorim will surely be to collar Kobbie Mainoo for a chat at Carrington. His exclusion from the England squad allows Amorim the opportunity to have a frank and open conversation with the 20-year-old.",
      "It was disappointing but not altogether surprising that Mainoo requested a loan move away from United after being cast aside by Amorim for much of the campaign so far. That being said, the Portuguese head coach wants the midfielder to remain in the building and in his plans so a meeting to express that would be a good place to start.",
      "If Mainoo was so eager to leave Old Trafford, he would have handed in a transfer request rather than a loan equivalent. That suggests there should be no concerns surrounding the midfielder's attitude moving forward and there is still a chance that he can prove to be a real asset at Amorim's United.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "Another player who asked to leave but is facing a much more uncertain future is Tyrell Malacia. He is the last remaining member of the so-called 'bomb squad' to be without a new club and he faces a long wait until January to move on.",
      "It is in both United and Malacia's interests to organise a transfer for him sooner rather than later. A move to Turkey or Saudi Arabia is therefore the only option left.",
      "No interest has materialised from clubs in either country to date but that could all change. Even if it is just a loan until January, at least the 26-year-old would be getting games under his belt.",
      "Perhaps of more urgency is figuring out what to do in the goalkeeper department. United have four senior goalkeepers in their ranks and ultimately that is one too many.",
      "Senne Lammens looks highly unlikely to leave on loan - if that was the plan we would have heard by now. Tom Heaton has only just signed a new deal so that leaves just one of two men who need to exit.",
      "You would imagine that finding a suitor for Altay Bayindir would be easier considering his Turkish roots. However, Andre Onana's exit could be given the green light should a significant sum come in - most likely from Saudi Arabia.",
      "Either way, someone has to go.",
      "Last up, United need to start making a plan for the January transfer window now which they will be able to implement straightaway. The mid-season market is notoriously difficult to negotiate so planning is everything.",
      "It goes without saying that, as things stand, midfield would be the priority. Whether United have the funds to sign a big name like Carlos Baleba or Adam Wharton midway through the season remains to be seen.",
      "But either way, the desire will surely be there to add at least one central midfielder to tide the club on to next summer. Of course, this is all presuming that other areas of the squad do not need sorting come January.",

      "Argentina boss Lionel Scaloni reckons Emi Martinez has swiftly regrouped following a chaotic deadline day that saw him stay put at Aston Villa rather than securing a switch to Manchester United.",
      "Martinez had been receptive to departing Villa throughout the summer and was enthusiastic about a move to Old Trafford after five campaigns at the club.",
      "Despite penning fresh terms just last August, Villa were prepared to allow his departure if the correct bid materialised during the transfer window.",
      "United lodged a loan bid for Martinez earlier in the summer, but Villa turned it down. No formal approach arrived from United thereafter, including on deadline day.",
      "Instead, United chose to recruit Senne Lammens from Royal Antwerp, leaving Martinez as Villa's number one as he departed to link up with Argentina for the September internationals.",
      "Prior to their clash against Venezuela, Scaloni was quizzed about Martínez's frame of mind, reports Birmingham Live.",
      "\"Emi is fine,\" Scaloni said in his press conference. \"In the end, his transfer didn't happen, but yesterday (Tuesday) was his birthday and I saw him happy.",
      "\"Of course, he must have been excited about the idea of playing for Manchester United, as people have said, but he's a positive kid. He's already focused on us, and when he returns to his club, he'll be focused on them. I saw him well.\"",
      "When questioned if he was worried Martínez might lose his starting berth at Villa, Scaloni responded: \"I'm interested in him playing, but we're not going to get ahead of ourselves.",
      "\"I understand that, if he stays, everything will continue as normal. We'll see what happens. It's not my decision.\"",

      "Manchester United midfielder Kobbie Mainoo has shown Ruben Amorim that he is not resting on his laurels this week despite not being called up for the England squad.",
      "Mainoo's future at United appears to be in serious jeopardy at present after he asked to leave the club on loan last week. The Reds' response to this request was one of defiance with Amorim eager to keep hold of the youngster.",
      "As the window slammed shut on Monday, it was clear the 20-year-old would not be departing Old Trafford and he remains a United player until January at least. Mainoo's urge to depart the north west stemmed from his lack of playing time so far this season.",
      "Despite United not proving themselves to be world beaters so far this season, Mainoo has struggled for minutes. He has also seen his close friend Alejandro Garnacho leave which may have also led him to question his role in the United set-up.",
      "While some players may prove to be a handful after missing out on an exit at the end of the window, Mainoo appears to be keen to get his head down and earn his place in the starting XI. Sharing a post from a training regime at Hale Country Club, Mainoo seems keen to keep his fitness levels high ahead of the Premier League's return.",
      "After missing out on a call-up to the England squad, Mainoo will be on a reduced schedule this week before hitting the ground running next week before the Manchester derby. Whether this alone will earn the midfielder a start against Manchester City remains to be seen.",
      "Currently, he is in direct competition with Bruno Fernandes for a starting place which perhaps indicates why he has not been getting the minutes he desires as of yet. The next four months will show whether Mainoo will repeat his brutal decision to request an exit again or not.",

      "United sources have said the midfield was never a priority due to already having options that the club views as strong and versatile.",

      "\"I think we overcomplicated it. For me, the most important thing is that no matter what happens, we try. Sometimes we play well, too open, too fast, losing possessions, but the effort is there.\"",

      "\"The good days are coming,\" promised Ruben Amorim during his speech on the final day of last season.",
      "Manchester United finished 15th in the Premier League and needed to respond in the summer window. Many thought defeat in the Europa League final would damage the club's prospects in the market.",
      "Thankfully, the window did not unfold like that. Liverpool were the Premier League club to 'win' the summer with their impressive business, but United must be considered among the sides who have conducted fine deals after a productive three months in a difficult market to manoeuvre.",
      "United overhauled their attacking line after scoring a dismal 44 league goals last season, adding Premier League-proven players and a striker, and completed the signing of a goalkeeper.",
      "The only blemish was the failure to sign a new midfielder, which could be a major problem area.",
      "But it's worth focusing on the positives to begin with. Matheus Cunha was the first signing of the summer for £62.5milliion from Wolves, which was a straightforward deal to complete.",
      "United triggered Cunha's release clause at Molineux and personal terms were not a problem. It was the perfect start, but fans began to raise concerns during the pursuit of Bryan Mbeumo.",
      "Brentford are notoriously tricky to negotiate with and hung tough in discussions for Mbeumo. United entered talks by bidding £45m, with £10m in add-ons, and they finally walked away from the table with an agreement to sign Mbeumo for £65m, plus £6m in add-ons, over a month later.",
      "United are not the only club to be stung by the Bees' tough negotiating this summer, as Newcastle signed Yoane Wissa in a £55m deal on the final day of the window after a dogged pursuit of the forward.",
      "Mbeumo was signed in time to travel to the United States for the pre-season tour. He got off the mark against Grimsby and scored his first Premier League goal against Burnley.",
      "Cunha and Mbeumo should be terrific additions. They have already demonstrated their quality in their short time at the club, and supporters are desperately hoping for a positive injury update on Cunha after the Brazilian was forced to be substituted with a muscle injury in the first half against Burnley.",
      "In comparison, Benjamin Sesko has looked rusty, although he does possess the potential to become one of the finest strikers in Europe. Ideally, United would have signed a frontman with experience, but they had to play the cards they were dealt and Sesko was attainable.",
      "United moved with impressive speed to wrap up a deal for Sesko, beating Newcastle to his signature. The Magpies are in the Champions League this season, but Sesko always preferred a move to Old Trafford.",
      "The only slight negative with Sesko is that United needed a striker who could hit the ground running, someone who would make an immediate impact and score goals in the Premier League.",
      "Amorim has not started Sesko in the league since his arrival, preferring Mason Mount down the middle instead.",
      "Speaking after the win over Burnley, Amorim explained his decision not to bring the Slovenia international on earlier against Scott Parker's side.",
      "\"So he finished the [Grimsby] game with cramps, really in the limit. That's why we protected Ben from the penalties,\" explained Amorim.",
      "\"And today was that reason also, because (Joshua) Zirkzee is also a striker, he's an international striker. But I was thinking that Ben, during the pre-season, he didn't do 90 minutes.",
      "\"And he did that, even against a division four team, he did that on Wednesday. And with the problem of Cunha, you don't know if that full game in the middle of the week has something to do with the injury today.",
      "\"With the problem with Mason Mount (injury), I was not risking another player, not knowing if they are able to play so many minutes. So everything was connected. The penalty, the game on Wednesday, and the number of minutes that I was thinking to put Ben today.\"",
      "In the same press conference, Amorim defended his goalkeeper options, but it was crucial that United pushed in the final days of the transfer to strengthen that department.",
      "Altay Bayindir has made mistakes against Arsenal and Burnley in the Premier League this season. Andre Onana was recalled against Grimsby Town and made an error for their second goal.",
      "United sources consider Senne Lammens to be an exciting young goalkeeper with a bright future. The 23-year-old was called up to Belgium's senior squad in March and has a huge opportunity at United.",
      "It is hoped the £18.2m fee to sign Lammens from Royal Antwerp could prove to be a bargain in a few years. Diego Leon and Enzo Kana Biyik were also exciting young additions for the club's future.",
      "United explored signing a midfielder in the window. Brighton valued Carlos Baleba in excess of £100million and planned to keep him for another season, which killed the hope of adding him to the squad.",
      "The 21-year-old has developed a strong reputation in a short space of time at Brighton, but would Baleba have been an instant success? He is a young midfielder and Brighton's valuation was daunting.",
      "Nonetheless, it is disappointing that United ended the window without strengthening in the centre of the pitch. Casemiro and Manuel Ugarte are poor options and Amorim felt he needed a fresh face.",
      "United will have to make do for the first six months of the season. Midfield could be a problem and United would have overseen a perfect transfer window if they had signed a top player in the ilk of Casemiro.",
      "Ineos chiefs will have to settle for 'an almost perfect' window instead. The members of the 'bomb squad' proved hard to shift, but United eventually got there in the end, with the exception of Tyrell Malacia.",
      "Marcus Rashford joined Barcelona on loan and there is an option to make the move permanent for £26m. Barcelona are covering Rashford's wages, which is estimated to save United around £12m this season.",
      "Alejandro Garnacho was sold to Chelsea for £40m. That felt like a low fee for a player whose value was much higher 12 months ago, but the wider context must be considered",

      "Manchester United have upheld a near century-old tradition after Ruben Amorim blocked Kobbie Mainoo's late push to leave the club.",
      "Worried about limited first-team minutes - and with the 2026 World Cup presumably on his mind - Mainoo had asked to leave on loan in search of game-time. He was also linked with a £50million permanent move to Napoli, though the Serie A side never followed up with a formal bid.",
      "As a result, Mainoo remains in United's first-team squad, a role of particular significance given he is the only academy graduate currently in the group. For 88 consecutive years, the Red Devils have ensured that at least one homegrown player features in their senior setup.",
      "During Sir Alex Ferguson's reign, academy products regularly formed a sizeable part of the squad. But in the decade or so since his departure, those numbers have steadily declined.",
      "This summer alone, United lost three more graduates: Marcus Rashford joined Barcelona on loan, Alejandro Garnacho completed a move to Chelsea, and Jonny Evans hung up his boots. Had Mainoo left as well, the club's longstanding tradition of promoting from within would have come to an end.",
      "In truth, United may have simply kicked the can down the road. Mainoo's long-term future remains uncertain. His contract runs until 2027, but negotiations over fresh terms have stalled for months - sewing seeds of doubt and unrest in both camps.",
      "Should talks continue to stall and Mainoo's playing time remain limited, United could be forced to consider selling, particularly before he enters the final year of his deal, when player valuations typically drop.",
      "That said, Amorim has publicly stressed that Mainoo remains central to his plans, despite his cautious use of the youngster so far. \"I want Kobbie to stay,\" he said ahead of United's 3-2 win over Burnley on Saturday.",
      "\"He needs to fight for his place. And we need Kobbie, so that is not going to change. I understand that the players that are not playing in this moment are disappointed. Everyone will have the same opportunity to play. You have to fight during the week.\"",
      "Mainoo first broke into United's senior squad during the 2022/23 season and has since made 74 appearances, scoring seven goals. This term, however, he has featured only once in the Premier League.",
      "Under Amorim, he has played in around two-thirds of the Portuguese's 46 matches in charge at Old Trafford, but has been named in the starting XI just 16 times. Injuries have played their part, but Amorim's preference for a two-man midfield has made competition fierce, with Bruno Fernandes, Casemiro and Manuel Ugarte all seemingly ahead of him in the pecking order.",
      "Now, Mainoo faces a battle not only to secure his place in Amorim's side, but also his future at the club - with United's proud tradition and history, in part, hanging in the balance.",

      "Neville told NBC Sports: “I’ve been asking around about that one this morning and spoke to a few people at United. The feeling is the new boy coming in would probably be a No.2 who would start on the bench, but they absolutely do need a No.1.”",
      "And now the Daily Mail claim that Sunderland and Leeds could have signed Lammens earlier in the summer transfer window before Man Utd got a deal over the line.",

      "It is not yet clear whether Lammens was signed from Royal Antwerp to be the No.1 or not but the Daily Mail continues: ‘The Premier League poses a range of tests for goalkeepers – athletic, mental, physical, technical – that exceed those of most other leagues and though scouts could see Lammens’ potential, they felt it would be a risk to pitch him straight into a first-choice role in England.’",

      "Still, there are nine players, including two new team-mates, paid more than  British football’s most expensive star.",
      "This ranking is based on weekly wages only – no bonuses included – with most figures sourced from Capology.",
      "",
      "10) Alexander Isak (Liverpool) – £280,000 a week\nIsak will be paid £14.56m a year, the same as Arsenal’s highest earner, Kai Havertz. That’s an increase of 133 per cent on the £120,000-a-week salary he was trousering at Newcastle. Which is not unreasonable since his agent can point to Isak’s status as British football’s most-expensive player.",
      "",
      "9) Omar Marmoush (Manchester City) – £295,000 a week\nThe first of four Manchester City entries in the top 10 and perhaps one of the more surprising names on the list. His agent played a blinder when he moved to City because the striker was only on just north of £33,000 a week at Eintracht Frankfurt.",
      "",
      "8) Jack Grealish (Manchester City/Everton) – £300,000 a week\nIt is no surprise to see Grealish on such an extraordinary salary since it was negotiated when he became English football’s first £100million purchase, before Pep Guardiola had sussed that he didn’t fancy the star after all. Grealish has joined Everton on loan, with the Toffees liable for £225,000 a week, making him their highest-paid player by a margin of £100,000 a week, while City top up the rest.",
      "",
      "7) Bruno Fernandes (Manchester United) – £300,000 a week\nUnited probably wept weekly when similar amounts left their coffers to be deposited into Jadon Sancho and Casemiro’s accounts but Fernandes is more than worth it to the Red Devils. Without him, things would have been even bleaker.",
      "",
      "6) Bernardo Silva (Manchester City) – £300,000 a week\nSilva is in the final season of his £15.6million-a-year salary at City. The Portugal star reportedly doubled his money when he signed a new contract in 2023.",
      "",
      "5) Raheem Sterling (Chelsea) – £325,000 a week\nArsenal copped for around 30% of Sterling’s salary when he was on loan at the Emirates last season but he’s all Chelsea’s problem now. The Blues are working to find a solution but you can’t blame Sterling for sitting tight until he’s paid what he is contractually owed.",
      "",
      "4) Virgil van Dijk (Liverpool) – £350,000 a week\nVan Dijk is on almost double the salary he signed for when joining Liverpool in 2018. Few would argue the captain hasn’t been worth his money, but we remain to see if that remains the case through the deal he recently penned to stay for two more seasons.",
      "",
      "3) Casemiro (Manchester United) – £350,000 a week\nUnited almost doubled Casemiro’s Real Madrid wage and, at first, he looked good value for money. Then…he did not. United have tried to shift his salary off their books but with a year to go, so far, there have been no takers. Sounds like a job for the Saudi lads.",
      "",
      "2) Mo Salah (Liverpool) – £400,000 a week\nLiverpool fans were relieved earlier this year to see Salah end a season-long saga by putting pen to paper for two more years. The new deal earned the striker a £2.6million-a-year pay rise and though £41million over two years might terrify the weirdos who think a footballer is finished at 30, it would have cost a sh*te sight more to replace him.",
      "",
      "1) Erling Haaland (Manchester City) – £525,000 a week\nWe’re told that there were months of negotiations before Haaland signed his deal for 10 (TEN) seasons which makes us wonder: where the hell was his agents’ starting point?! It is obviously a very cushy deal for Haaland, but also a massive ‘f*** you’ from City to, well, everyone.",

      "The transfer window is closed, but we’re not quite ready to give up on transfer features just yet. Not when the alternative is international break fixtures and having to think about how on earth we go about doing an England Ladder in a world where Ruben Loftus-Cheek is back in the mix.",
      "So we will continue milking the window for all its worth until the very last drop.",
      "Here we take a look at a few of the more obvious holes and gaps and in some cases meteorite-contact craters that were left unfilled in Premier League squads when the window slammed so dramatically shut and once again, despite it having been around for so very long, caught a lot of teams apparently by surprise.",
      "",
      "It’s a tricky balancing act, when you think about it, getting the right mix of goalkeepers in your squad.",
      "You obviously want good goalkeepers and one excellent one, ideally. Your second-choice needs to be someone who can come into the team without prompting mass panic. And then there’s the third-choice, who should in a perfect world be a cheerful veteran playing out his final days in the professional game and living his very best life.",
      "The key, really, lies in getting the right gap between your first and second-choice keepers. The second-choice keeper needs to be good enough to keep the first-choice honest, but without creating unnecessary confusion. Proper competition for places is good, generally, but keeper is a position where you really want a bit of reliability and certainty.",
      "Liverpool, of course, had got it perfect in recent years with the elite world-class number one in Alisson, and then a very good but clearly not quite as good back-up in Caoimhin Kelleher. And even Liverpool couldn’t sustain it forever as Kelleher’s understandable desire to be first-choice somewhere grew undeniable.",
      "Manchester United do not have it, and on deadline day they made it even more confusing. In Andre Onana, Altay Bayindir and now Senne Lammens, United have three goalkeepers who will all believe they could or should be first choice. Even the bit they had right – cheerful veteran third-choice keeper – is blown apart because Tom Heaton is now fourth-choice. What a mess.",
      "United did not need to create further confusion in a vital position that has already cost them this season and did so frequently last season.",
      "Had they bought a Donnarumma or a Martinez, it could still have all gone wrong but there would at least have been clarity about who the first-choice keeper was.",
      "Lammens is highly-rated and may in time be the long-term solution. But expecting that to happen quickly is wing-and-a-prayer stuff. Not for the first time in recent years, the United brains trust has afforded itself the luxury of a transfer with an eye on the future when this is a club and team that needs real-time solutions right now.",
      "It’s nice to set yourself up to be judged on the future rather than the present, because the future never comes. But United are drowning in waters they’ve just needlessly muddied.",
      "We really do think that United and City would both benefit from a swap deal.",
      "",
      "Liverpool enjoyed one of the most outrageous transfer windows ever and it really does seem churlish to nitpick. But there remains a non-zero chance that devoting so much energy to the cherry-on-top signing of Alexander Isak to bolster an already absurdly overpowered Premier League champion attack while leaving a deal for Marc Guehi until the very last minute might appear an error in priorities.",
      "Liverpool have left themselves riskily short at the back, even if Ibrahima Konate was currently operating at the top of his game. Which he is not. Guehi was not just a squad option; he would have instantly improved Liverpool’s first XI.",
      "Joe Gomez is still there as a versatile utility option to fill in gaps where they may appear in the back four, but for all their dizzying quality across the pitch, now Liverpool do appear alarmingly reliant on a 34-year-old Virgil van Dijk being able to play pretty much all of the football – and there is so very much of that football – for at least the next four months.",
      "Given the outlay Liverpool have made elsewhere – and we’re not knocking any of that because we are giddily excited about watching what this team produces – that just seems a daftly unnecessary position to have put themselves in.",
      "And the argument that Liverpool had done what they needed to do to remedy it with Guehi just doesn’t really wash; if you leave such a vital deal until the very last minute you always leave yourself at the mercy of a transfer chain breaking down with a potentially devastating domino effect.",
      "",
      "Spurs’ centre-back hole is perhaps less immediately conspicuous than Liverpool’s because they have two unquestioned top-tier starters in Cristian Romero and Micky van de Ven, as well as slightly less lofty ambitions for the season as a whole.",
      "What they don’t really have is anything much else if or far more realistically when either/both of those two is unavailable. And while both that pair are top-class performers on the pitch, neither has really proved themselves too reliable at getting on that pitch 50+ times a season.",
      "Romero is in his fifth season at Spurs and has only once managed more than 27 Premier League games. Last season he featured in less than half Spurs’ 38 games.",
      "Van de Ven and his rubber-band hamstrings have played in 43 of Spurs’ 79 Premier League games since joining in the summer of 2023.",
      "Kevin Danso is a perfectly capable third-choice centre-back, and when everybody’s fit also provides Thomas Frank with the back-three option he deployed against PSG.",
      "Beyond that, though, Spurs find themselves relying on Ben Davies. We love Ben Davies, but a Champions League club should not be relying on Ben Davies in big 2025. After that, it looks like poor Archie Gray getting thrown in at the deep end again.",
      "Easy to see why Spurs enquired about Manuel Akanji and Nathan Ake at City; harder to see why they didn’t really seem to try much else when neither of those avenues proved productive.",
      "",
      "Hard to escape the notion that 49ers Enterprises have let Leeds and Daniel Farke down in the closing days of the window.",
      "There was a lot of promising early work after promotion, with a clear priority for signing some really big lads. A policy we can all get behind for any promoted team embarking on a survival mission.",
      "But even as that process was taking place there was a curious lack of attackers among that collection.",
      "Goalkeeper, defence and midfield were all strengthened really quite impressively, but it’s going to mean nothing if Leeds can’t put the ball in the net.",
      "Sure, having concerns about Patrick Bamford’s injury record and deciding to replace him with Dominic Calvert-Lewin is very funny and everyone likes funny, but this is serious business, lads. It’s no time for banter and whimsy.",
      "Leeds have left themselves dangerously short of creativity and attacking quality in a league where staying in games and frustrating opponents really can only take you so far.",
      "Farke and his team have shown across a challenging first three games that they can certainly compete – even against Arsenal they kept them at arm’s length pretty easily for over half-an-hour before a Classic Set-Piece Goal – but one goal from a contentious penalty in 270 minutes tells a story.",
      "One point against Newcastle was perfectly good, but it could so clearly have been three with just a bit more attacking oomph.",
      "And while Arsenal away is not a fixture upon which Leeds’ season stands or falls, what was alarming there was not really the unflattering final scoreline but the complete and total inability to get out and try to land any kind of punch of their own. The sight of a team with giants in defence and midfield launching the ball to Dan James, Willy Gnonto and Joel Piroe and watching it come straight back every time was borderline comical.",
      "Farke said he needed two attacking players in the closing days of the window and he was right. He got none. It might cost him and Leeds everything.",
      "",
      "Never ask a woman her age, a man his salary, or a Newcastle fan how Yoane Wissa engineered his deadline-day move to Tyneside.",
      "There’s a very decent case that Brentford’s most conspicuous and damaging black hole is to be found in the dugout where Keith Andrews (for now) occupies Thomas Frank’s big chair. But on the field they’ve been decimated with the two leaders of last year’s attack in Bryan Mbeumo and Wissa off to pastures new.",
      "The wide-forward positions have been addressed in numbers at least – although Brentford do seem to have ended up with a large collection of players who would by choice operate from the left.",
      "Igor Thiago has thus far stepped up gamely to his new first-choice role through the middle with two Premier League goals and another in the Carabao, but he is literally the only centre-forward left in Brentford’s squad, with none of their ragbag collection of wingers and wide forwards particularly compelling ‘Could do a job through the middle, at a push’ candidates.",
      "There could be worrying amounts of unconvincing Kevin Schade false-ninery ahead for the Bees.",
      "Crystal Palace have revealed their new asking price for Liverpool target Marc Guehi ahead of the January transfer window, according to reports.",
      "Marc Guehi is reportedly angry that his move to Liverpool fell through at the final hurdle but an upcoming payday plus his previous actions make it hard to have too ...",
      "Liverpool fans continue the net spend chat while wondering aloud if they should have signed Marc Guehi rather than Alexander Isak.",
      "Premier League rivals Leeds and Sunderland chose to reject the signing of new Man Utd goalkeeper Senne Lammens in the summer, according to reports.",
      "If it was Isak’s decision to strike or not, it does not matter for while he takes a public battering, football’s biggest influencers counts their millions.",
      "A deal to sign Marc Guehi would have “certainly happened” if Liverpool had increased their offer for the Crystal Palace captain, according to reports."

      "Man Utd are planning to break their transfer record in 2026 to bring Brighton midfielder Carlos Baleba to Old Trafford as part of a double coup, according to reports.",
      "The Red Devils were fairly busy in the summer transfer market with Sir Jim Ratcliffe and INEOS bringing in five new signings to help Ruben Amorim this season.",
      "Benjamin Sesko, Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo should ensure that Man Utd don’t finish the season as one of the lowest scoring sides in the Premier League, like last term.",
      "While left-back Diego Leon, who signed from Paraguayan side Cerro Porteno, and goalkeeper Senne Lammens provide the squad with added potential.",
      "Amorim will be hoping Lammens is good enough to replace Altay Bayindir or Andre Onana in net with the latter not starting a Premier League match this campaign.",
      "A midfielder was the missing piece of the summer jigsaw with some fans and former players favouring a move in that position over a new striker.",
      "MAILBOX: Liverpool beware: ‘humiliated’ Newcastle will ‘punish’ their ‘sickening entitlement’ over Isak",
      "But, rather than bringing in a new midfielder, Man Utd decided to splash £74m on Sesko, who scored 39 goals in 87 appearances for Bundesliga side RB Leipzig.",
      "And now our friends at TEAMtalk claim that Man Utd have ‘locked in’ the signing of Brighton midfielder Baleba with transfer insider Dean Jones insisting it could be part of a ‘double midfield swoop’ in 2026.",
      "Man Utd were put off a move for Baleba this summer over the huge price tag with the Seagulls hoping to get a fee similar to the £115m received from Chelsea for Moises Caicedo in 2023.",
      "TEAMtalk add that Man Utd enquired this summer in order to show Brighton they are serious about signing the Cameroon international and the Red Devils are ‘not deterred by the prospect of having to spend over £100million’.",
      "With the futures of Bruno Fernandes, Casemiro and Kobbie Mainoo seemingly uncertain, Man Utd are likely to add a second midfielder over the next couple of transfer windows.",
      "TEAMtalk names Crystal Palace’s Adam Wharton, Atalanta’s Ederson and Sporting CP’s Morten Hjulmand as options Man Utd have ‘explored’ with the trio having a combined asking price of around £222m.",
      "Rio Ferdinand suggested Baleba as a target for Man Utd before their interest was revealed earlier this summer and he reiterated his desire to see a deal done.",
      "Ferdinand said on his YouTube channel in mid-August: “Baleba, he’s a young kid, he’s a wonderful talent, high ceiling. [But] what I would say is, it’s about managing expectations if someone like him does come in.",
      "“By no means am I saying that you buy him and he’s the absolute answer and he’s the key to everything being unlocked. He’s a young kid who will need to develop. He’ll need to be integrated into the squad, into the system.",
      "“He’ll have to learn and understand the responsibilities of being at Manchester United. Different requirements. Different pressure. All these things come into it when you sign for Manchester United. He’ll make mistakes, but that’s part of it.”",
      "Man Utd are set to return for Brighton midfielder Carlos Baleba in the future after the Red Devils agreed personal terms, according to reports.",
      "Real Madrid could complicate Premier League transfer plans this summer with a move for a sought-after Crystal Palace star.",
      "Manchester United have reportedly picked out their ‘dream target’ from another Premier League side, and the star man is open to a move to Old Trafford.",
      "According to reports, Manchester United are ‘willing to invest’ around £130m to ‘close two signings’, while they plot a move for a Real Madrid star.",
      "Man Utd ‘can afford’ top midfield target Carlos Baleba this summer and ‘could revive a deal’ for the Brighton star despite reports claiming they’ve admitted defeat.",
      "After their pursuit of Carlos Baleba went cold, former Manchester United defender Rio Ferdinand has given his old club another target they should go after."

      "According to reports, Manchester United received three ‘enquiries’ from Premier League clubs for Kobbie Mainoo after the midfielder asked to leave on loan.",
      "He then started against Grimsby Town in the Carabao Cup and came off the bench at half-time against Burnley on Saturday, helping Ruben Amorim’s side record their first win of the campaign.",
      "United fans were aghast at the prospect of Mainoo leaving, whether it was permanently or on loan, but the 20-year-old stayed put beyond Monday’s transfer deadline.",
      "There was plenty of interest in Mainoo from clubs in England and abroad, and the Daily Mail has revealed the six clubs that were in the race for his signature.",
      "Indeed, it’s claimed that Italian champions Napoli ‘were leading the chase’ ahead of Serie A rivals AS Roma and French giants Marseille.",
      "MEDIAWATCH: Kobbie Mainoo to Real Madrid? How very convenient…",
      "In the Premier League, United reportedly received ‘enquiries’ from Everton, Tottenham Hotspur and Aston Villa.",
      "However, Amorim’s side ‘wanted him to stay and fight for his place’, as his chances of a departure were severely reduced after injuries to Matheus Cunha and Mason Mount against Burnley.",
      "Let’s have a look at the six clubs the England midfielder could have joined on deadline day, shall we?",
      "One of the biggest losers of the 2025 summer transfer window, Unai Emery did get his paws on Harvey Elliott on deadline day, but Mainoo would’ve been an outstanding addition, even if it was a straight loan.",
      "We like this a lot, considering Villa’s England contingent of Ollie Watkins, Morgan Rogers and Ezri Konsa, on top of Amadou Onana and Boubacar Kamara’s injury problems.",
      "Out of all three English clubs, this strikes us as the best fit for Mainoo. I guess we’ll never know.",
      "We love this. The best team in Serie A. Managed by Antonio Conte. In the Champions League. But mostly, there are some players in Naples that Mainoo is familiar with.",
      "Scott McTominay was named Serie A Most Valuable Player after leading Napoli to the title last term, proving that the grass is very much greener on the other side. McTominay was officially joined by Rasmus Hojlund on Monday, but that deal was agreed long before.",
      "In terms of midfield competition, Mainoo would be battling for game time with the Scot and his international team-mate Billy Gilmour, as well as Frank Anguissa and Stanislav Lobotka. And if Conte viewed him as a more advanced midfield option, he’d be competing with Kevin De Bruyne…",
      "Thomas Frank’s attacking is looking strong and the deadline day addition of Randal Kolo Muani has done him no harm in that department.",
      "But in midfield, there was room for more recruitment, especially if Yves Bissouma is to remain out in the cold. Champions League football is on offer at Spurs, who do feel like a good fit for Mainoo.",
      "Everton are becoming exciting to watch following the addition of Jack Grealish, who complements Iliman Ndiaye very well. His quick renaissance under David Moyes should be a positive sign for any player looking to get their career back on track, and while Mainoo’s too young to worry about his career falling by the wayside, it would’ve been in his thinking had the Toffees’ interest intensified.",
      "James Garner and Idrissa Gana Gueye are fine midfielders, but there’s no doubt that Mainoo would be an upgrade on both. We just couldn’t see him going for it, with European football on offer everywhere else.",
      "Again, Mainoo will be familiar with one player at Marseille, Mason Greenwood. But they signed Matt O’Riley from Brighton instead of pushing for the United man.",
      "Roberto De Zerbi is another head coach a player like Mainoo could benefit from working with. The Italian does have some solid Ligue 1 midfielders already, like Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg, Angel Gomes, Geoffrey Kondogbia and Arthur Vermeeren.",
      "Not as sure about Roma, but working under Gian Piero Gasperini is an exciting proposition. Their midfield is significantly thinner, though Manu Kone is a super player.",
      "Real Madrid are now ‘one step away’ from completing the signing of Man Utd midfielder Kobbie Mainoo on deadline day, according to reports.",
      "Man Utd will only allow Kobbie Mainoo to leave Old Trafford before the deadline if they can bring in a replacement first, according to reports.",
      "Man Utd have been dealt a significant blow as a £25m ‘offer’ is ‘withdrawn’ despite reports of an ‘agreement’, while Mainoo doubles down.",
      "Man Utd boss Ruben Amorim insists he wants Kobbie Mainoo “to stay” at Old Trafford and “fight for his place” this season.",
      "Fabrizio Romano has clarified Kobbie Mainoo’s transfer stance amid conflicting reports as a standoff between the Man Utd midfielder and the club brews.",
      "Man Utd midfielder Kobbie Mainoo is demanding a loan move before the transfer deadline with numerous clubs interested, according to reports."

      "Aston Villa are reportedly ‘bitter’ after Manchester United won the race for Royal Antwerp goalkeeper Senne Lammens, despite offering more money for the 23-year-old.",
      "Unai Emery’s side had targeted Lammens on deadline day amid uncertainty surrounding the future of first-choice goalkeeper Emiliano Martinez.",
      "Man United had registered interest in signing the Belgian shot-stopper earlier last month but didn’t agree a deal until the final hours of the summer transfer window.",
      "There was the possibility of Martinez ending up at Old Trafford and Villa replacing him with Lammens, but the former has stayed at Villa Park despite making it clear he wanted to leave back in May.",
      "He’s been left with egg on his face, while the Red Devils have improved their goalkeeper depth with the addition of Lammens, who’s not expected to come straight into Ruben Amorim’s starting XI.",
      "F365 SAYS: Man Utd and Man City are signing goalkeepers ill-suited to who and where they are",
      "Andre Onana has been the club’s first choice since the start of 2023/24, but Amorim has preferred Altay Bayindir at the start of the season, keeping faith in the Turkish international after a mistake led to the only goal of the game in their Premier League opener against Arsenal.",
      "Bayindir started at Fulham and then against Burnley on Saturday as United earned their first win of the season.",
      "It’s unclear who Amorim’s long-term No.1 will be, but the expectation is that Lammens will have to work for the shirt.",
      "He might not have to work that hard, though. Amorim clearly doesn’t rate Onana and Bayindir is worryingly error-prone.",
      "United’s first game after the international break is away to Manchester City, which does suggest he won’t be thrown straight in.",
      "Villa, meanwhile, are searching for their first goal and win of the season after drawing with Newcastle United and losing against Brentford and Crystal Palace.",
      "It’s been a miserable start to 2025/26 for them, and their transfer business hasn’t given the fans much to be excited about.",
      "The goalkeeper deadline day debacle rubbed salt in the wounds for the club’s supporters, with Lammens joining United for a fee below what the Villans offered Antwerp.",
      "That’s according to the Daily Mail, where it’s claimed that Lammens joined United for £18.2m plus £3.5m in add-ons, and pushed for his ‘dream move’ to Old Trafford that left Martinez in limbo and Villa feeling ‘bitter’ after making a ‘higher’ bid.",
      "It all comes down to ‘pulling power’, which still gives the Red Devils ‘a crucial advantage in the transfer window’, despite back-to-back all-time worst Premier League seasons.",
      "Other examples cited are Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko, who both snubbed interest from elsewhere to move to Old Trafford.",
      "After joining the Red Devils, Lammens said: “In my team in Antwerp, there were some players who were also in England and, when I talked to them about Manchester United, you could directly see their face change. The club alone, the aura of the club, it’s massive, and being here today, seeing it, it’s a different level.”",

      "Premier League rivals Leeds and Sunderland chose to reject the signing of new Man Utd goalkeeper Senne Lammens in the summer, according to reports.",
      "Man Utd appear to have three second-choice keepers and no first-choice, while Liverpool and Spurs have gambled on their first-choice defence staying fit.",
      "Manchester United reportedly decided to sign Senne Lammens over Emiliano Martinez for two key reasons, while one star ‘will go’ in the coming days.",
      "Jadon Sancho’s preference to leave on loan stopped Man Utd from signing a £25m Premier League star on transfer deadline day, according to reports.",
      "Man Utd and Man City are both set to sign goalkeepers ill-suited to who and where they are. Any chance of a deal sheet Lammens, Donnarumma swap?",
      "Man Utd have reached a ‘total agreement’ to sign Royal Antwerp goalkeper Senne Lammens ahead of the deadline, according to The Athletic’s David Ornstein."

      "Alexander Isak joins new Liverpool team-mate Florian Wirtz in our top 10 Premier League signings of the 2025 summer transfer window.",
      "There are so many honourable mentions. We have many players we really like, but couldn’t find space for.",
      "Transfers like Viktor Gyokeres to Arsenal, Gianluigi Donnarumma to Manchester City, Granit Xhaka to Sunderland, and Hugo Ekitike to Liverpool all miss out, but are all fantastic deals in our eyes. It’s just that these ten are a little bit better.",
      "Anyway, let’s get to it. Here are our top ten Premier League signings of the 2025 summer transfer window.",
      "",
      "We loved this move before Grealish registered two assists on his Everton debut against Brighton. And then another brace of assists away to Wolves, heavily contributing to two wins in a row for David Moyes’ side.",
      "Fans across the country will agree that it’s bloody fantastic to see Grealish playing regularly and enjoying his football again. After becoming a robotic player under Pep Guardiola, he can now express himself and be the player we all know and love. Moyes will give Grealish the platform to succeed and influence a side in need of more flair. Iliman Ndiaye can only do so much. Speaking of which, that’s one exciting duo.",
      "Signed on a season-long loan, the 29-year-old has given him the best chance of making Thomas Tuchel’s England squad for next summer’s World Cup. And if all goes to plan, Everton will view his £50million buy option as a no-brainer.",
      "",
      "One of the most promising wingers in the world, it’s a breath of fresh air to see a genuine Brazilian wonderkid make the jump to the Premier League, rather than Real Madrid or Barcelona. The hype might not be the same as it was for Neymar, but that’s probably because he hasn’t made the traditional move to one of La Liga’s juggernauts.",
      "A warm-up injury to Cole Palmer on matchday two saw Estevao come into the Chelsea starting XI against West Ham, and he looked very, very dangerous. The 18-year-old assisted compatriot and fellow new signing Joao Pedro and his scary pace, confidence and dribbling ability will make him a nightmare for full-backs. And he’s only going to get better.",
      "Bought from Palmeiras for under £30m, Estevao will prove to be one of the biggest bargains of a crazy 2025 summer transfer window.",
      "",
      "Cunha is a great player who Manchester United might destroy. They’ve got previous. Lots of it.",
      "Cunha was exceptional for Wolves last season, earning a move to the biggest club in England, to play as one of Ruben Amorim’s ‘wide 10s’, a position he seems perfectly suited for.",
      "It’s hard to see Cunha struggling at Old Trafford because he’s very, very good at football. But we do fear for him. Because, you know, lads, This Is Manchester United We’re Talking About.",
      "MAILBOX: Man Utd have signed another ‘knob-end’ in Mr Walky McWalkface",
      "",
      "Pedro’s brace against his boyhood club Fluminense at the Club World Cup left us in awe, and he didn’t stop there, scoring against PSG in the final as Chelsea smashed the European champions 3-0.",
      "The Blues splashed out £55m, which already doesn’t look like too much. They might finally have an elite No.9 that makes Enzo Maresca’s side serious Premier League title contenders.",
      "",
      "Pep Guardiola has signalled a readiness to tweak his defensive philosophy with the £31m signing of Ait-Nouri from Wolves. The Algerian international is more naturally a wing-back, but we’re confident in his ability to hold his own as an out-and-out full-back.",
      "That’s the role he’ll play at Man City, especially after the left-back spot has been consistently filled by centre-backs. Guardiola’s rotation policy means Josko Gvardiol will still start games there, but his move to left-centre-back could be the most significant outcome of the Ait-Nouri signing.",
      "The former Wolves registered 24 goal involvements in 135 Premier League appearances for the Midlands side, and his attacking instincts certainly add an edge to a City side that underwhelmed in 2024/25.",
      "MORE F365 TRANSFER FEATURES\n👉 Will Liverpool signings Ekitike and Wirtz fall victim to the dreaded Bundesliga tax?\n👉 Emi Martinez takes the gloves in our post-transfer window Premier League Stuck Man XI\n👉 Liverpool extend lead as the world’s 10 biggest spenders of 2025 summer transfer window after Isak\n👉 Guehi ‘screwed’ by Palace and why Liverpool spending £400m is different to Chelsea and Man City",
      "",
      "Just like with Cunha, the fact that Mbeumo has joined Manchester United means we have reservations.",
      "We want to love this signing. Mbeumo fits Amorim’s system perfectly. But this club, man. If the ex-Brentford star ends 2025/26 with three goals after scoring 20 last term, we won’t be shocked. But for now, credit where it’s due. On paper, it’s an excellent deal for United.",
      "",
      "This is a big upgrade on Arsenal’s previous No.6, with Zubimendi bringing a calming presence and outstanding levels of consistency to Mikel Arteta’s midfield. He might not reach Rodri’s level, but he can reach Rodri levels of influence on this Gunners side.",
      "His first three games against Manchester United, Leeds and Liverpool have shown promise, and the fact Zubimendi will help Martin Odegaard get back to his best, while Declan Rice continues to be an attacking threat, makes him a priceless addition.",
      "",
      "A lot will be made of the £100m transfer fee Liverpool paid, and every single Florian Wirtz touch will be forensically analysed by people who’ve never seen him play before now. It’s already started.",
      "Wirtz’s start hasn’t been the best, but he’s allowed a settling-in period, even if his transfer fee was a club-record signing.",
      "When the German does settle into his Liverpool role, we’re expecting him to be one of the best attacking midfielders in the league, if not the best. He’s one of the main reasons the Reds are the biggest winners of the window.",
      "READ NOW: Florian Wirtz value exposed by quarter-price Rayan Cherki in seven damning stats",
      "",
      "Nico Gonzalez didn’t automatically become the best midfielder in the world after his big-money January move, so Man City went out and signed Reijnders from a Milan side without Champions League football next season, and what a bloody signing he is.",
      "The Dutchman’s arrival was necessary after Kevin De Bruyne’s departure, while Mateo Kovacic and Bernardo Silva are not getting any younger. Reijnders is a different type of midfielder to De Bruyne, but he brings an elite ability to carry the ball up the pitch and combines relentless energy with superb technical quality. He’s more of an Ilkay Gundogan successor.",
      "It’s hard to find a downside to this deal.",
      "",
      "The saga to end all sagas. We’re delighted it’s over, and pretty surprised it took until Deadline Day for it to be finalised.",
      "Isak cost Liverpool a British record £135m and while new team-mates surround him, the settling-in period is probably limited to one or two games, having broke that record, and come from another Premier League team. For Newcastle, the Swede scored 54 goals in 86 Premier League appearances. He’s joined the champions and a team that wants to attack, attack, attack, so we can see Isak joining the 100 Club before or during 2027/28.",
      "There is a lot of pressure, especially considering how Isak manufactured his move to Anfield. We’re fairly confident he’ll be just fine, and his addition makes Arne Slot’s side the favourites for every competition they’re in this season.",
      "READ NEXT: The most expensive XI in Premier League history passes £1bn after Liverpool finally spend Coutinho money",
      "Liverpool breaking the British transfer record twice to sign an elite striker and creator was ‘unthinkable’ but it means they should be judged by the Quadruple.",
      "The Premier League is able to field an XI bought for over £1bn after Liverpool finally dipped into the Philippe Coutinho money and treated themselves.",
      "Did Florian Wirtz look like a British record transfer player as Liverpool played Newcastle? Plus, Unai Emery sack chat.",
      "Wirtz’s bow, the start of Chelsea’s title challenge and Sesko v Gyokeres before calls for Arteta’s sacking. The Premier League is back and we could not be more giddy…",
      "Arne Slot said Liverpool’s huge moves in the transfer window this summer have been justified by player sales, suggesting the club has done nothing new.",
      "Chelsea and Liverpool have both found value in the transfer market by underpaying for a couple of players each, while Arsenal have a bargain of their own."

      "And former Man Utd chief scout Mick Brown – who is still well-connected at Old Trafford – insists that he was “absolutely fuming at the manager’s body language and presentation” against Burnley and Grimsby.",

      "“They threw away their lead, but then got a penalty with virtually the last kick of the game.",
      "“Bruno Fernandes had to walk up and take that penalty, in front of 70,000 people and millions watching on TV, with all of the pressure of having lost the shoot-out mid-week.",

      "“The manager is hiding with his head in his hands and his feet up, taking no responsibility and placing all of the pressure on his players.",
      "“Bruno Fernandes deserves a lot of praise for the penalty against Burnley under pressure. But the manager’s body language and actions were an absolute disgrace.",

      "“I think this is something very hard to handle, especially when you’re a manager and when you manage big clubs like Manchester United.",
      "“But I have a feeling as well in the meantime that this guy needs help.",
      "“He said something good and then he said something bad. He said something good, ‘I’m happy but I’m not happy. I want to be with my players but I want to kill them.’",
      "“He needs help and I feel pity for him sometimes because he tries to do his best. His body language, his press conference…",

      "Even Sir Jim Ratcliffe’s “world-class” dream team at Manchester United are making mistakes as their “very poor” recruitment continues…",
      "",
      "Was the summer transfer window positive for Man Utd? It’s certainly debatable, but we’re leaning towards yes. Just about.",
      "Did United sign the wrong goalkeeper on deadline day? Probably, but at least the late arrival of Senne Lammens means the days of Andre Onana and/or Alter Bayindir starting regularly for the Premier League giants are over.",
      "They have also overhauled their attack with the additions of Benjamin Sesko, Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha for around £200m combined, with the early indications that the latter two should be relatively successful at Old Trafford, while we’re unsold on their £74m man.",
      "And perhaps most importantly, all but one member of the back seat on the school bus crew left the club, with only Tyrell Malacia remaining following the summer exits of Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho, Antony and Alejandro Garnacho.",
      "So not too bad overall, though the continuation of last season’s misery under Ruben Amorim in the early weeks of this campaign suggests they are still miles off the leading pack and have no chance of meeting Sir Jim Ratcliffe’s set target of winning the Premier League by 2028.",
      "To put Man Utd on track to achieve this aim, Ratcliffe has been a busy man as he’s alienated himself to the point where he’s rivalling the Glaser family in terms of unpopularity at Old Trafford following several brutal and/or needless decisions, notably the so-called implementation of a “world-class” recruitment team after years of “very poor” transfer business.",
      "Ratcliffe is right in saying that Man Utd’s recruitment, overall, has been extremely dour post-Sir Alex-Ferguson, though he and his supposed dream team of experts, including director of football Jason Wilcox and chief executive Omar Berrada, are far from perfect.",
      "This has been exposed in The Athletic‘s annual exposé of Man Utd’s business via their ‘inside the transfer window’, which has revealed a couple of gems from this summer.",
      "Firstly, we have Wilcox’s verdict on Man Utd’s top priority for the summer window.",
      "‘The choice at that stage was to go for a No 6 or a No 9. Some at the club believe a midfielder should have been the priority, but Wilcox advocated to sign a scorer, after United’s record of 44 Premier League goals last campaign, and Ratcliffe backed that call.’",
      "There is a semblance of logic to Wilcox’s stance, with the lack of goal threat needing to be addressed after Man Utd became especially toothless in attack following the implementation of Amorim’s 3-4-3 formation.",
      "But as poor as Joshua Zirkzee and especially Rasmus Hojlund were last season, a contributing factor to their woes was the absence of a creative spark in Man Utd’s side to forge chances.",
      "The arrivals of Mbeumo and Cunha ease this issue, and while an upgrade in the No.9 position was needed, it was a mistake to spend £200m on attackers and completely ignore the No.6 department, which is equally in need of fixing.",
      "Carlos Baleba would have been the perfect solution and he could still prove to be that in January or next summer, though United’s period of punishment is to continue as long as they are without a selfless protector and well-rounded midfield partnership.",
      "Further forward, the return of a proven Premier League striker to take some of the pressure off Sesko, Hojlund and/or Zirkzee, but Ratcliffe wasn’t playing ball.",
      "‘Ratcliffe was known to feel United could not sanction a two-year deal for [Danny Welbeck], who is 35 in November, and instead a one plus one was discussed, but the offer was not formalised.’",
      "Sesko, like Hojlund, could easily end up faltering amid the overwhelming pressure of carrying Man Utd’s frontline from a young age, but his chances of succeeding would be greater if there were a Welbeck-type player for him to lean on for support.",
      "Welbeck would have been a cheap and risk-free signing as he’s been the model professional throughout his career, and his recent renaissance suggests he is still capable of delivering on and off the pitch for United.",
      "READ NEXT: Emi Martinez takes the gloves in our post-transfer window Premier League Stuck Man XI",

      "Manchester United have put forward plans for their new stadium which they aim to open in 2030.",

      "It already looks like a massive sliding-doors moment for both player and club. In a bad way. We’d imagine Villa will still want him gone if there’s any way of doing so, meaning Turkish and Saudi clubs might be sniffing a bargain.",
      "",
      "The right-back’s January arrival was somewhat overshadowed by Villa’s flashier winter loan moves, but with his path to the first team blocked by Matty Cash there was plenty of talk in the summer about some pretty eye-catching teams across the continent weighing up moves that never materialised for a man whose main chances of Villa action will likely be restricted to Europa League and domestic cup competitions.",
      "We don’t imagine he’s heartbroken to still be at Villa, but with Sevilla, Real Betis and top-flight clubs in both Germany and Italy interested it would be surprising if his head hadn’t been at least slightly turned by the prospect of more regular football in some of those places.",
      "",
      "Look, we’re not going to just try and make all of these ‘maybe a Turkish club saves the day’ but this is another one that really does look like it might need a Turkish club to save the day after a proposed loan move to Elche collapsed as the clock ticked down.",
      "Some unwanted Stuck Men scream Turkish big three. Malacia, we would suggest, screams ‘whichever club is currently trying to muscle in and disrupt that big three’. Trabzonspor or some such. We don’t know, we’ve not looked into it. But Tyrell probably should.",
      "",
      "Spent the second half of last season on loan at Aston Villa but now returns to his previous status as a fully paid-up member of the Chelsea Bomb Squad.",
      "Plenty of reports suggest Disasi had Premier League options late in the window, but they were more of the Bournemouth and Wolves and West Ham variety. Personally, we’d have been pretty keen to explore that Bournemouth option but we can see why the other two carried less appeal than sitting around collecting pay-cheques at Cobham with Raheem Sterling.",
      "Saudi Pro League side Neom have been linked because obviously.",

      "We do feel sorry for him, but not that sorry. It must be desperately hard to think that big dream move to the Premier League champions and current favourites is happening only for the rug to be pulled at the last minute, but the idea that Palace did anything unreasonable here is a daftness.",
      "Liverpool started the summer complaining about Trent Alexander-Arnold and ended it complaining that Palace didn’t simply let them have their captain without a suitable replacement being sourced first, and spent their time in between those two events bullying all manner of smaller clubs into all manner of stunning transfer successes for the Reds.",
      "They – and Guehi – will simply have to accept this rare defeat. And on Guehi’s part, the disappointment should be tempered by knowing he’s been a model pro who gave his all for Palace until the very end – something, ultimately, not even Eberechi Eze was prepared to do – and there will be no humiliating and difficult reintegration process to be completed here.",
      "And in January and especially next summer, Guehi will have full control of his future while also almost certainly being England’s first-choice World Cup centre-back.",
      "There are people in this team in a far worse pickle, is what we’re saying here.",
      "",
      "P*ssed off Thomas Frank from the very start with his shoddy timekeeping leading to an internal ban from the Super Cup against PSG, and despite now being available he appears to have dropped firmly to the very bottom of a midfield pecking order that also features Joao Palhinha, Rodrigo Bentancur, Pape Sarr, Archie Gray and Lucas Bergvall.",
      "If we were to make a prediction for what the next week or so holds for him, it would involve whichever members of the Turkish big three have a manager in place to make the decision to sign him.",

      "Man Utd striker Rasmus Hojlund ‘considers himself better’ than summer signing Benjamin Sesko after signing for Napoli on loan, according to reports.",
      "The Red Devils chose to sign a new striker over a midfielder in the final month of the transfer market with Sesko arriving from RB Leipzig in a deal worth £74m.",
      "Hojlund joined his boyhood club Man Utd in 2023 for £72m from Serie A side Atalanta but he failed to hit the ground running at Old Trafford.",
      "The Denmark international managed a very respectable 10 Premier League goals in 30 appearances in his first season but the 22-year-old could only manage four goals in 31 matches last term.",
      "Hojlund was linked all summer with a move away from Old Trafford and he pushed back on leaving during the transfer window as he looked to remain at Man Utd.",
      "He told reporters during pre-season: “My plan is very clear. That is for me to stay and fight for my spot, whatever happens.",
      "READ: Villa and Newcastle among transfer window losers as idea of a Big Eight suffers fatal blow",
      "“Competition is fine with me. It sharpens me. I’m more than ready. I’m feeling sharp so I welcome everything that comes.”",
      "Hojlund added: “When I came, [Anthony] Martial was there as well but he had a lot of injuries, so I obviously had to take a lot of the game time",
      "“You’re not going to tell me I shouldn’t be playing because I want to play every game. But obviously I could have done with some help in terms of sharing the games a bit, especially in the beginning.”",
      "Hojlund continued to plead his case for staying at Man Utd, he said: “I’m still very young. People forget that sometimes. I’m only 22. Not every striker scores 100 goals by that age.",
      "“But I’ve learned a lot, I think you can see it in my game. I’m starting to develop and become even better in the basics.",
      "“Last season was tough on us all. I should have done better, everybody knows.",
      "“But it’s also a team thing. We’re going to be better now. We are progressing in the right way and looking forward to what’s coming.”",
      "Napoli eventually agreed a loan move for Hojlund with the Danish striker staying until the end of the season and Man Utd included a  €44m buy option which will turn into an obligation if the Serie A side qualify for the Champions League.",
      "And now The Athletic have revealed that one of the reasons he was looking to stay and fight for his place was his belief that he is better than new signing Sesko.",
      "The Athletic wrote: ‘Part of Hojlund’s motivation, it can be revealed, was that he considers himself better than the centre-forward United have agreed to pay €85million for. He felt showing that in sessions might give Amorim pause for thought on his departure, despite Sesko’s arrival.’",
      "The potential end of his time at Old Trafford has been a sad time for Hojlund, the report added: ‘Hojlund was said to be heartbroken over the realisation his Old Trafford dream was over aged 22, especially when he started pre-season expecting to continue. The episode demonstrates how Ratcliffe, Berrada, Wilcox and Amorim are operating without sentiment.’",
      "According to reports, Manchester United had a last-minute ‘approach’ for a former Chelsea star ‘rejected’ on deadline day for one key reason.",
      "Manchester United’s current woes are being left at the feet of pretty much everyone. Can this all be Ruben Amorim’s fault?",
      "Only Andre Onana was rated lower than the £74m signing who waited until the very end to take his penalty in the shootout.",
      "Manchester United losing to Grimsby has prompted all manner of responses, but most want Ruben Amorim out of the club.",
      "Man Utd striker Rasmus Hojlund is likely to move to Serie A giants Napoli ‘within 48 hours’ in a loan with an option to buy, according to reports.",
      "According to reports, England international Kobbie Mainoo has made a decision on leaving Manchester United after being snubbed by Ruben Amorim."

      "Jamie Carragher has argued that there is a one reason behind Manchester United’s decision to stick with head coach Ruben Amorim amid a “big clamour”.",
      "Amorim is under immense pressure at Man Utd as he is currently the second-favourite to be the first Premier League manager sacked this season.",
      "The 40-year-old had a torrid time after replacing former Man Utd boss Erik ten Hag towards the end of 2024 as he struggled to implement his preferred 3-4-3 formation.",
      "Under Amorim, the Red Devils plummeted to 15th in the Premier League and they lost to Spurs in the Europa League final, while their problems have carried over into this campaign.",
      "Man Utd invested around £200m to overhaul their attack by signing Benjamin Sesko, Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha, but they are still ineffective in forward positions and easy to play through.",
      "READ: Villa and Newcastle among transfer window losers as idea of a Big Eight suffers fatal blow",
      "Carragher has commented on Amorim’s situation, claiming he would have “lost his job earlier” if he “wasn’t such a good-looking man”.",
      "“There is now a big clamour to get Jose Mourinho back in English football and the reason is because he’s box office, he comes out with stuff, but he was a winner. We always remember Brian Clough – when I was a kid and he was speaking you’d listen because he was a winner,” Carragher claimed on The Overlap Fan Debate.",
      "“The problem with Ruben Amorim is that he’s great in the press conferences but because he’s not winning, people are thinking, ‘Oh, shut up. Stop speaking.’ But if he was winning, we’d all be thinking he’s a great character and personality.",
      "“If he wasn’t so charismatic in the press conference, and wasn’t such a good-looking man, he might have lost his job a lot earlier. When you look at the results, they are horrendous.”",
      "Carragher also credited Amorim for his achievements at Sporting Lisbon, though he did name two other Premier League managers who are “better” than the current Man Utd boss.",
      "“He said something in the press conference – ‘I will nail this system down so the players can play it with their eyes closed’, I think he said – I don’t think he’ll get the time to do that if he doesn’t start getting results,” Carragher added.",
      "“He’s still a very young manager – what he did at Sporting Lisbon, we shouldn’t write off because that was a brilliant achievement when you think of Benfica and Porto in that league. To win the [Portuguese] league a couple of times with Sporting is a huge achievement.",
      "“Take Unai Emery and Eddie Howe. They’re not managers that are going for the league, but they are good managers.",
      "“To think this guy [Amorim] has got all the answers to get Manchester United back to the top when there are managers that aren’t even going for the league and are more experienced, there are a lot of better managers in the Premier League, and I think it’s going to be tough for him to turn it around.”",
      "Man Utd boss Ruben Amorim is safe for now but the Red Devils have decided what would ‘prove fatal’ for the head coach this season, according to reports.",
      "Man Utd boss Ruben Amorim has been labelled an “absolute disgrace” with the Red Devils tipped to sack him over the international break.",
      "Jamie Carragher has revealed the Liverpool attack that he would favour playing for the rest of the season after Alexander Isak signed on deadline day.",
      "Losing at home to West Ham has left Nuno Espirito Santo in some quite considerable trouble. Even more than Ruben Amorim.",
      "Jamie Carragher has slammed Mikel Arteta after Arsenal’s defeat to Liverpool: “Heavily reliant on set-pieces, don’t create anything in open play.”",
      "Are Man United actually going to be any better this season than last season? They really might not be much better. In which case, Amorim’s in trouble."

      "According to The Athletic, Welbeck’s impressive form last season sparked fresh interest from Man Utd, who ‘considered making a proposal of a contract until 2027 should they agree a fee with Brighton’.",
      "It is indicated that certain figures at Man Utd ‘felt he would add experience, technical quality, and heritage to the squad after spending 16 years at Old Trafford, graduating from the academy’.",

      "‘But Ratcliffe was known to feel United could not sanction a two-year deal for a player who is 35 in November and instead a one plus one was discussed, but the offer was not formalised.’",
      "The report has also revealed two more Premier League stars who were on Man Utd’s radar in the summer.",
      "‘United had Dominic Calvert-Lewin in the background as a candidate on a free, with Wilcox feeling he could be a useful deputy, but United declined to make a proposal.",
      "‘As an alternative to Mbeumo, United held talks on Antoine Semenyo, but Bournemouth’s £70m valuation was seen as too high.’",
      "Even Sir Jim Ratcliffe’s “world-class” dream team at Manchester United are making mistakes as their “very poor” recruitment continues…",
      "Manchester United are back. Sir Jim Ratcliffe has ‘masterminded’ a big spend, ‘rebuilt’ everything and even won the Alejandro Garnacho transfer situation.",
      "Manchester United have put forward plans for their new stadium which they aim to open in 2030.",
      "Man Utd are not budging on their valuation of Bryan Mbeumo this summer even if it means moving on to different targets, according to reports.",

      "Tuesday 2 September 2025 23:16, UK",
      "Manchester United came into the summer transfer window tasked with beginning to remedy the reasons for the club's worst-ever Premier League season.",
      "A 15th-place finish last term represented an all-time low for United, who failed to inspire on the pitch. The season ended in further disappointment in the form of a Europa League final defeat to Tottenham, denying them Champions League football, which further raised the importance of this summer window.",
      "Having arrived in November of last season, the last few months have represented Ruben Amorim's first summer window in charge at Old Trafford. United were busy from the off, getting Matheus Cunha done early before completing moves for Bryan Mbeumo, Benjamin Sesko and securing Senne Lammens' services on the final day.",
      "Within that there were also departures for Antony and Alejandro Garnacho, in permanent deals to Chelsea and Real Betis respectively, as well as Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho and Rasmus Hojlund leaving on loan.",
      "Manchester United will reflect on their summer transfer business and ask four specific questions:",
      "1) Is the squad better now, than the one that ended last season?",
      "2) Did they get all of their primary marquee targets?",
      "3) Did each of the signings fit the club's new parameters in terms of age, profile and cost?",
      "4) Did they manage to move on those high-earning players that are not part of Amorim's plans?",
      "Even the most critical supporter would have to admit that the answer to all of those questions is \"yes\".",
      "That is not to say that the issues at United are fixed. Far from it.",
      "It is a huge juggernaut of a club that has lurched in the wrong direction for far too long, crashing into plenty of obstacles en route.",
      "And they are still a long way from being Premier League title contenders and are long shots for the Champions League.",
      "But the club's hierarchy knows that it will take a lot of time and effort to make them regular challengers to Liverpool, Arsenal and Manchester City.",
      "They won't shy away from that, and they feel confident that they are now starting to put the fundamentals right and make inroads into the gap between them and the Premier League's best. This transfer window was the start of that.",
      "The juggernaut is at least now being steered in the right direction.",
      "United's transfer strategy this summer has been simple, strategic and is being based increasingly on data. The hierarchy at Old Trafford knows it will take several windows to get the squad where they want it to be, and there will be some imbalance and some pain in the meantime. Amorim is fully on board with that plan.",
      "Financial restrictions mean that they have had to prioritise - and it's very clear that the priority has been to make United an attacking force again, even if that means putting other positions of need on the backburner.",
      "So why have Manchester United focused on forward areas, with £207.2m spent on three players, at the expense of other positions? Director of football Jason Wilcox and his team forensically analysed the recent past. The focus was how the team performed last season, and this is the one statistic that leaps out: apart from the three relegated teams, only Everton scored fewer goals than Manchester United last season.",
      "For a club famed above all else for its attacking football and entertaining style of play, that was damning. It became an overriding priority, which is why they targeted Cunha (£62.5m), Mbeumo (£71m) and Sesko (£73.7m).",
      "Before trying to sign those three, the club analysts produced their reports, and the scouts produced theirs. Only when the two were put together - hearts and minds, if you like - did they produce a pecking order of targets.",
      "In United's eyes, those three players were the \"best in class\" for the specific roles the team needed, and they got each of them at fair market value, and on affordable salaries that are in line with the new structure.",
      "Very simply, the stats showed that in order for United to climb the table it was essential they scored more goals - and that is more important than keeping them out at the other end. If they scored the same number of goals again this season, the calculations went, it would be impossible for Manchester United to make the top six.",
      "By contrast, only Everton and Crystal Palace had better defensive records than United outside the top nine clubs in the Premier League last season. That might seem a strange statistic to most fans when you consider United conceded 54 goals in 38 matches, and had a goal difference of -10 over the season.",
      "In fact, United's defensive record last season was their third worst in the modern era - and the two that topped it, also occurred in the last five years.",
      "It would be wrong to suggest that United's recruitment team isn't aware of the defensive frailties and the need to strengthen in midfield. Rather, they identified the lack of goals as a more pressing concern, and know there is no quick fix to improving the squad as a whole.",
      "Look at United's goalkeeping targets as a case in point...",
      "Plenty of people in football will ask why, if you have one of the world's best goalkeepers available and keen to move to Old Trafford, would you turn him down and choose an unproven young stopper instead?",
      "That is the reality of United choosing Senne Lammens over Emi Martinez. The Argentina World Cup winner is without doubt one of the best in world football. But he is 33 years old. He was likely to cost over £30m. He would, quite rightly, demand a huge salary. And there would be very little value in any future fee United could demand for him, if they sold him. Exactly the same reasoning explains why United didn't choose to rival Manchester City for Gianluigi Donnarumma, one of the best goalkeepers of his generation.",
      "Instead, they went for Lammens. Not the finished article, not in the same league right now when compared to Donnarumma and Martinez. But a player who fits into the new wage structure, and who the metrics and scouts say has all the potential, with good coaching and development, to be a future Manchester United number one.",
      "Last season, he had one of the highest \"goals prevented\" statistics in Europe, made more saves than any other keeper in Europe's top 10 leagues, and proved he was good with his feet, too - making the most progressive passes for any goalkeeper under the age of 23.",
      "Just £17.3m? Half the price of Martinez? A good deal, as far as United were concerned.",
      "The club are determined to avoid the mistakes of the past, where some big-name players with big reputations ended up as expensive bench-warmers. Or worse, VIP viewers from the posh seats in the Sir Alex Ferguson stand, such has been the bloated nature of United's squad.",
      "And they are delighted that this summer has seen many of their extraneous players leave Old Trafford. Chelsea think they got a great deal for Garnacho, with a fee of £40m, but United are happy too, earning the largest sale ever for an academy player.",
      "Rashford has his entire wages covered by Barcelona for the coming season. Antony, Hojlund and Jadon Sancho are all out of the building too, which limits the external noise around the squad and the manager.",
      "There is no shying away from the fact that United have wasted big money on some big-name players who simply haven't cut it at Old Trafford in recent years.",
      "The \"bomb squad\" has cost them almost £100m in lost revenue. United paid Ajax £86m for Antony in 2022 and they have now sold him to Real Betis for £21.7m. Hojlund cost £72m from Atalanta two years ago - he is now on loan at Napoli, with an obligation for them to pay £43m for him next summer (if Napoli make the Champions League).",
      "Sancho's move to Aston Villa isn't a permanent switch, but United will recoup 80 per cent of his wages and earn a chunky loan fee. Only Tyrell Malacia remains at Carrington after the club's best efforts to move him on to Elche failed on Deadline Day.",
      "United won't shy away from the mistakes they've made in the past, and they accept that it will cost money to correct them.",
      "But this window has seen evidence of a new financial discipline, so that they hope there will be fewer expensive mistakes in the future. The fact that they weren't tempted to over-pay for Carlos Baleba - with Brighton reportedly wanting £100m for the 21-year-old - is a case in point. United like him; he fits their profile, the metrics are good... but the finances don't stack up. Hence, there was no approach.",
      "Many United fans will be questioning why the midfield wasn't deemed a priority position.",
      "Gary Neville said after the 1-1 draw with Fulham: \"In central midfield, I think United have to do a piece of business now. I would have liked to have thought that (Kobbie) Mainoo could step up and be that person, but it's quite clear that at this moment in time Amorim is not having him.\"",
      "Amorim has been key in tweaking the role of Casemiro, who he thinks is much fitter and more influential already than last season. And United see the captain Bruno Fernandes happily occupying the central midfield role alongside him for much of this season, with Cunha taking on the more advanced number 10 position.",
      "United would also point to the fact that Mainoo is yet to start a Premier League game this season, and is waiting in the wings.",
      "A young midfielder who started for England in last season's European Championship final is currently struggling to get into Amorim's starting 11.",
      "Why would you try to buy more midfielders if a player of his quality can't get in? And United are adamant they will not sell him. It was only in the final week of the window when Mainoo went to the club and asked them to explore a possible exit, frustrated as he was by the lack of game time. Mainoo was met with a categorical \"no\" and told that Amorim and United want to keep him. He is on a long contract. He is not for sale.",
      "The United project is much more evolution than revolution. It is a work in progress. This summer's transfer window wasn't perfect, but United's bosses stuck to their principles and their strategy. They are pleased with the ins and the outs.",
      "They feel they have caught up some of the ground on the clubs ahead of them. But they know there is still a long road ahead.",
      "The hope inside Old Trafford is now that, with the juggernaut plotting a more steady and sensible course, there are fewer potholes to navigate.",
      "Super 6 are starting the season by guaranteeing a £1,000,000 winner! Play for free."

      "Wednesday 3 September 2025 18:08, UK",
      "NFL UK general manager Henry Hodgson says the league is open to exploring opportunities to play in other stadiums across the country as it continues its global expansion with a historic international slate of games.",
      "The league will host three more regular-season games across Tottenham Hotspur Stadium and Wembley Stadium in the 2025 season to take the tally of London match-ups to 42 since 2007.",
      "Such has been the sport's ascent on this side of the pond, there is an increasing appetite to enhance the game's presence beyond the capital, including the prospect of games.",
      "Football is living in historic times as it gears up for seven international games in 2025. Could Manchester United's proposed £2bn, 100,000 capacity stadium emerge as an option down the line?",
      "\"Would we look at other options? I think we'd certainly be open to those conversations. I'm very keen to make sure that we're taking the sport across the country.",
      "\"This year we have a kick-off event that's taking place in Manchester. We've got a tour going to Birmingham and to Bristol and to Cardiff. So we want to make sure that the NFL isn't seen as a London sport where we go and play games.",
      "\"We know that there are fans across the UK and we want to serve those fans across the UK. Somewhere down the road, if there are conversations to be had about that stadium or frankly any other new stadiums in the UK, we're certainly open to having those discussions. Again, for the same reason, to see how we can bring more NFL to more new people.\"",
      "Tottenham has emerged as the official home of the NFL in the UK having become the first purpose-built NFL stadium outside of the United States.",
      "Hodgson attributes its success to a long-term 'vision' of Tottenham Hotspur in accommodating the league, though accepts it can be a \"case-by-case\" basis regarding other prospective host stadiums.",
      "\"You look at the partnership we have in Tottenham, I think one of the reasons that I believe that stadium is so good is that that partnership happened long before the stadium itself started being built,\" Hodgson added.",
      "\"So it came with that as a real central part of their project. That was the vision of Daniel Levy and of Tottenham, as well as the NFL. So you'd think that that would lead people to, you know, if you were going to do it, that would be the way to go. But I'm sure different people would approach it in different ways.\"",
      "The NFL, meanwhile, remains committed to expanding its global reach, and earlier this year announced its first game in Australia at the iconic MCG.",
      "Germany is currently gearing up for its fifth regular-season game when Berlin follows in the footsteps of Frankfurt and Munich as a host city this year, while Madrid and Dublin enter as new territories.",
      "A trip to France could also be on the horizon next.",
      "\"Paris is certainly one of the cities we've looked at,\" said Hodgson. \"Everyone knows that the NFL continues to look around the world at cities that we could play games in and do that in a really considered way.",
      "\"We want to make sure that when we go and play a game, wherever it might be in the world, it's not simply for the sake of playing a game, but for growing a fanbase for the long term.",
      "\"And France certainly has a big fanbase of NFL fans existing, so Paris would lend itself as a city for us to play a game in.",
      "\"We continue to examine the opportunity to do that. And I would expect that it will happen. I think it's just a question of when. But there are a number of other cities around the world that we're looking at as well.\"",
      "Dublin's iconic Croke Park will welcome the Pittsburgh Steelers and Minnesota Vikings on Sunday September 28, before the latter stick around to face the Cleveland Browns at Tottenham the next week.",
      "The Denver Broncos then take on the New York Jets at Tottenham followed by the Los Angeles Rams against the Jacksonville Jaguars at Wembley, before the Indianapolis Colts host the Atlanta Falcons at the Olympiastadion and the Washington Commanders meet the Miami Dolphins at the Santiago Bernabeu Stadium in Madrid.",
      "\"It's an incredibly exciting year because we're playing in three new cities around the world in Madrid and in Dublin and Berlin,\" said Hodgson.",
      "\"I think for each of those there's going to be a very different atmosphere, a new set of fans who are going to get the opportunity to experience an NFL game for the very first time and a new city that's going to kind of have its own take on how to embrace the NFL.",
      "\"And then on top of that, obviously we've got games in London where the first game will be the 40th so you've got this established city.",
      "\"But I think both Dublin and Madrid are going to be really exciting, really fun, different events. Dublin, in particular, a city that really lends itself to these kind of big events and I think you're going to see the whole of Dublin overtaken by NFL fans over the weekend.\"",
      "The Philadelphia Eagles return as defending Super Bowl champions after dethroning the Kansas City Chiefs in a 40-22 victory in New Orleans in February, denying Andy Reid's side a third straight championship.",
      "Josh Allen's Buffalo Bills and Lamar Jackson's Baltimore Ravens resume their pursuit of a Super Bowl berth in the face of Kansas City's monopoly on the AFC, while Jayden Daniels leads a new era for the Washington Commanders. The Detroit Lions loom as one of the league's most prolific offenses as the Minnesota Vikings seek to maximise a Championship-calibre roster, while Micah Parsons prepares to alter the NFC entirely after his blockbuster trade to the Green Bay Packers.",
      "\"I think the NFL's in a fantastic period of really creating some very established, very fun rivalries,\" said Hodgson. \"You look at the AFC and you've had that sort of Chiefs, Bills, Ravens triumvirate over the last few years and who's going to get there, are the Bills and Ravens finally going to get over the hump?",
      "\"I think equally with the Chiefs, even more in the spotlight given some of the recent cultural news around the NFL as well.",
      "\"You've got a lot of teams that there are question marks around but could really come up and be very exciting. Washington Commanders last year, for a few people, sort of came out of nowhere, that was exciting.",
      "\"You've got the Lions who everyone seemed to be rooting for if they weren't an Eagles fan going into the postseason. You've got the 49ers who had a bit of a down year but maybe can bounce back and then across all of it the NFL throws up those surprises.\""

      "Premier League clubs spent a record £3.19bn in the summer window; Liverpool and Chelsea broke spending and selling records; clubs targeted Premier League-ready signings; Sunderland had a net spend twice as high as European champions Paris Saint-Germain",
      "By Adam Smith, Nick Wright, Jim Lethem, Joda Burgan, Dominic Ball",
      "Wednesday 3 September 2025 08:54, UK",
      "Premier League clubs spent a combined £3.19bn on signings this summer, smashing the previous record for a single transfer window as they scrambled to strengthen their squads.",
      "Liverpool's move for Crystal Palace defender Marc Guehi collapsed on Deadline Day but they still recorded the highest-spending transfer window by any club in Premier League history.",
      "Their British-record £125m move to sign Alexander Isak from Newcastle took their total spend to £446.5m, surpassing the £434.5m spent by Chelsea in the summer of 2023.",
      "The Isak deal ensured Liverpool broke their transfer record twice in one window having already signed Florian Wirtz for £116.5m from Bayer Leverkusen. Having also brought in Milos Kerkez, Jeremie Frimpong, Giorgi Mamardashvili, Hugo Etkike and Giovanni Leoni, the champions have strengthened their squad comprehensively.",
      "While Liverpool smashed the spending record, Chelsea had a record-breaking summer in terms of sales, becoming the first club to pass the £300m mark as they recouped a total of £314.4m.",
      "The Blues allowed a total of 23 players to leave the club permanently and received fees of £20m or over for nine of them. Their biggest sale was that of Noni Madueke to Arsenal for £52m, followed by that of Joao Felix to Al Nassr for £43.7m.",
      "Other sales included those of Christopher Nkunku, Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall and Djordje Petrovic, which banked Chelsea a combined £90m as they joined AC Milan, Everton and Bournemouth respectively. It should be noted, though, that, of those three, only the sale of Petrovic generated profit relative to his purchase price.",
      "Chelsea's record-breaking sales total does not include the £70.5m obligation included in Nicolas Jackson's loan move to Bayern Munich, a sum which will see the club more than double their money on the striker, signed from Villarreal for £30m in 2023.",
      "At the other end of the scale, newly-promoted Leeds were the only Premier League side not to generate any funds through sales.",
      "Both Liverpool and Chelsea spent more than Arsenal but it's the Gunners who come out top in terms of net spend having only recouped £10m in sales compared to Liverpool's £228.1m and Chelsea's record-breaking £314.4m.",
      "Arsenal did manage to trim their squad, with Fabio Vieira, Albert Sambi Lokonga, Jakub Kiwior, Reiss Nelson and Oleksandr Zinchenko joining the list of exits on Deadline Day. But generating funds through sales remains a challenge for the club.",
      "There were expiring contracts in the cases of Thomas Partey, Jorginho and Kieran Tierney, while others were only shipped out on loan. The club will recoup £24m through the obligation in Kiwior's loan to Porto, but that will come next year.",
      "The only money received in sales this summer came from Marquinhos's £2.5m move to Cruzeiro and Nuno Tavares' £7.5m exit to Lazio, leaving them with a table-topping net spend having made eight signings at a cost of £267m.",
      "The books will need to be balanced further down the line.",
      "Another trend this summer was an increase in deals between Premier League clubs. Players with experience of the competition and its unique intensity are increasingly in-demand.",
      "As recently as six seasons ago, intra-Premier League club deals were relatively rare. This summer, though, the money spent on signings between Premier League clubs topped £1bn, up from £788m last year. The pattern of the last eight campaigns suggests the trend will continue as clubs target Premier League-ready additions.",
      "More than 60 per cent of the £3.19bn spent by Premier League clubs this summer went on forwards. There was a huge scramble to add firepower led by the competition's elite sides.",
      "Liverpool added the most expensive forward of the lot with their Deadline Day move for Isak, taking their total spent on forwards to £320.5m having already signed the second and third-most expensive forwards in Wirtz and Hugo Ekitike.",
      "Manchester United also invested heavily in their front line, signing Benjamin Sesko, Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha for a combined £207m, while Arsenal and Chelsea also went big, with Viktor Gyokeres, Eberechi Eze, Joao Pedro and Liam Delap among their attacking additions.",
      "The money received by Newcastle for Isak went on Stuttgart's Nick Woltemade and Brentford's Yoanne Wissa, while other eye-catching deals saw Mohammed Kudus move from West Ham to Spurs for £55m and Dango Ouattara go from Bournemouth to Brentford for £42m. West Ham were the only Premier League side not to pay a fee for a forward in the window.",
      "It all added up to an eye-watering combined total.",
      "The scale of the spending by Premier League clubs dwarfed that of clubs in Europe's other major leagues.",
      "Italy's Serie A was the next-highest spending league but its total of £893.8m spent did not come close to the Premier League's £3.19bn.",
      "Spending in the German, Spanish and French leagues was even lower. While Premier League clubs finished with a net spend of £1.4bn, the Bundesliga and Ligue 1 registered profits.",
      "In terms of net spend, the highest-spending European clubs were Atletico Madrid, Como and Real Madrid, but their totals of £109.5m, £83m and £80.4m respectively were only comparable to mid-ranking Premier League teams.",
      "Incredibly, newly-promoted Sunderland had a net spend more than twice as high as that of Champions League winners Paris Saint-Germain's £64.9m, at £141.4m.",
      "The numbers underline the widening financial gulf between Premier League clubs and their European counterparts.",
      "Where did your club get stronger or weaker? Last week, Between the Lines broke down net spending figures by position to show the impact on the transfer window on Premier League teams.",
      "Super 6 are starting the season by guaranteeing a £1,000,000 winner! Play for free."

      "Tuesday 2 September 2025 13:06, UK",
      "Manchester United finally offloaded most of their 'bomb squad' as Antony completed a permanent move to Real Betis, while Rasmus Hojlund and Jadon Sancho joined Napoli and Aston Villa on loan respectively.",
      "The club had begun Transfer Deadline Day with Antony, Hojlund, Sancho and Tyrell Malacia exiled from Ruben Amorim's squad - with only the latter remaining at Old Trafford until January at least.",
      "Antony's return to Betis ended a summer of speculation over whether he would end up back in LaLiga, having spent the second half of last season at the club and racking up seven goal contributions in 17 games.",
      "He joined them for £21.7m, a loss of £64m from when Man Utd paid Ajax £86m for him in 2022.",
      "Jadon Sancho, who had been a target for Roma, joined Villa as one of a number of late additions to Unai Emery's squad, with Rasmus Hojlund making a temporary move, which could become permanent, to Napoli, who have been seeking further striking reinforcements all summer.",

      "Andre Onana has not featured for Man Utd in the league all season and was at fault for one of Grimsby's goals in their shock Carabao Cup defeat last week, with Altay Bayindir also faltering in his place in United's opening three Premier League games.",
      "Lammens joined from Royal Antwerp on a five-year deal for a fee of around £18.2m, including add-ons. Aston Villa's Emi Martinez had been discussed, but it was decided internally that Lammens was a better option.",
      "Lammens' skill as a shot-stopper was what impressed the club most; no goalkeeper made more saves in Europe's top 10 leagues last season and he had one of the highest goals prevented metrics in Europe. He also made the most progressive passes for any goalkeeper under the age of 23.",
      "As it stands, United are expected to move forward with four goalkeepers, adding Lammens to their current group of Bayindir, Onana and Tom Heaton.",
      "However, the windows in Turkey and Saudi Arabia are open until September 11 and 10 respectively and it is understood that if a suitable offer were to come in for any of Man Utd's other 'keepers, it would be considered.",
      "Antony had made no secret of his desire to avoid returning to Old Trafford at the end of last season, including a tearful interview while on loan at Betis where he said he had fallen out of love with football at United.",
      "In the end, he got his wish - but he had to wait right up to the end of the transfer window for it to happen. He leaves Old Trafford having played 62 Premier League games across three seasons, but contributed just eight goals and assists.",
      "He arrived at the club in 2022 as one of the major signings of the summer, following former boss Erik ten Hag from Ajax, but never managed to recreate his Eredivisie form for United.",
      "A number of clubs had been interested in bringing in Sancho this summer, including Chelsea, where he spent last season on loan and featured heavily in their run to the Conference League title. But, having failed to agree terms with the Blues, he returned to Old Trafford - and they paid a £5m fine as per the terms of his loan.",

      "Hojlund had impressed in pre-season and looked like he may end up as Man Utd's starting striker for a second season in succession, especially after expressing his wish to remain at Old Trafford - and Ruben Amorim's positive words about him.",
      "But, after the arrival of Benjamin Sesko, it became clear his days were numbered at the club and he did not feature in any of their four competitive fixtures before completing his temporary move.",

      "This vote may continue to change in the coming hours, teetering between a poor or average window after Marc Guehi's move to Liverpool fell through late on Deadline Day. There will be some Crystal Palace fans who are delighted that he stayed and others who felt the club should have cashed in.",
      "David Moyes spent most of the summer desperate for signings and the additions of Jack Grealish and Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall have already started paying off in the Premier League, with over 70 per cent of readers approving their business, the most overwhelming result of any club.",
      "Fulham left it late to sign striker Kevin in a club-record deal of £34.6m from Shakhtar Donetsk and force through a loan move for Bayern Munich forward Jonah Kusi-Asare, but it was still an underwhelming summer for Marco Silva's side.",

      "Man City's rebuild continued this summer as club legends Kevin De Bruyne, Kyle Walker and Ederson all departed with £185m spent on the next generation in Rayan Ait Nouri, Tijjani Reijnders, James Trafford and Gianluigi Donnarumma. However, our readers aren't too impressed.",
      "Big-name signings in Bryan Mbeumo, Matheus Cunha and Benjamin Sesko helped take Man Utd's spending to £232.4m while they were also able to offload Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho, Alejandro Garnacho, Rasmus Hojlund and Antony.",
      "However, without midfield reinforcements, over 40 per cent of readers believe their window is just average, although 35 per cent think it has been positive.",

      "Manchester United have completed a £18.2m deal to sign Royal Antwerp goalkeeper Senne Lammens; the Belgian shot stopper is now one of four goalkeepers at Man Utd, though they could sell any of the other goalkeepers to Saudi Arabia or Turkey as their windows close later",
      "Monday 1 September 2025 23:01, UK",
      "Manchester United have completed the Deadline Day signing of Royal Antwerp goalkeeper Senne Lammens.",
      "United have agreed a deal for the Royal Antwerp goalkeeper for around £18.2m plus add-ons.",
      "The club looked at other options, including Aston Villa goalkeeper Emiliano Martinez, but after much deliberation and negotiation, they feel Lammens is the right choice for the club moving forward.",
      "Lammens' skill as a shot-stopper impressed United. No 'keeper made more saves in Europe's top 10 leagues last season and he had one of the highest goals-prevented metrics in Europe. He also made the most progressive passes for any goalkeeper under the age of 23.",
      "As it stands, United will move forward with four goalkeepers, adding Lammens to their current group of Altay Bayindir, Andre Onana and Tom Heaton.",
      "However, the windows in Turkey and Saudi Arabia are open until September 11 and 10, respectively.",
      "It is understood that if a suitable offer were to come in for their other goalkeepers, it would be considered.",
      "Head coach Ruben Amorim had previously said he was happy with his goalkeeping department, despite several high-profile errors from Onana and Bayindir across the early stages of the season.",
      "Lammens is now the fifth signing of the summer for Amorim, taking their summer spend to £232m, following the arrivals of Benjamin Sesko, Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Diego Leon.",
      "The keeper was signed two years ago from Club Brugge and the sale represents nearly 100 per cent profit for the Belgian club.",
      "He made 30 appearances in the Belgian Pro League last season for Antwerp, keeping seven clean sheets.",
      "Speaking on the club's official channels after signing, Lammens said:",
      "\"You can feel the positive atmosphere that is being created here, and I know that I can make a real impact at the club in the coming years.",
      "\"I cannot wait to get to know my team-mates and begin working with Ruben [Amorim] and the coaching staff. This is the perfect place to keep developing, grow together with this exciting team and achieve my career objectives.\"",
      "United's director of football, Jason Wilcox, added: \"Senne is an excellent young goalkeeper with great potential.",
      "\"We are delighted that he has chosen to join Manchester United after significant interest from a number of clubs.\"",
      "\"Manchester United have signed Senne Lammens with an eye to the now as well as the future.",
      "\"The 23-year-old keeper, tipped to be Thibaut Courtois' successor in the Belgium national side, is seen as the best solution to strengthen an underperforming goalkeeping department after a shaky start to the season by the likes of Andre Onana and Altay Bayindir.",
      "\"It's no secret they looked at other options, such as tried and tested Emiliano Martinez at Aston Villa, but with all factors considered, United felt Lammens was the direction they wanted to go in.",
      "\"Although Lammens has limited experience - only one season as a first-choice No 1 at Royal Antwerp, United are confident in Lammens' potential to compete immediately as well as having room to grow with a side that has the ultimate aim to win the Premier League title in three years time.\"",
      "\"He's very calm. The mentality is good, I've spoken to goalkeeping coaches and he's been seen as a rising star in Belgium for quite a while.",
      "\"He was at Club Brugge and couldn't get past Simon Mignolet, who was in excellent form. He went to Antwerp, and the number of shots he's saving beyond what the expected goals would expect him to concede has been very, very high.",
      "\"Antwerp have one of the best defensive records in Belgium last season. But it's a huge leap to be the No 1 at Manchester United.",
      "\"An interesting thing is that when Ruben Amorim was at Sporting, they were tracking him then. So there's obviously been a like there for quite some time.\"",
      "Super 6 are starting the season by guaranteeing a £1,000,000 winner! Play for free.",
      "Lammens boasts some striking statistics last season, some simple and others complex. He saved four penalties in the Belgian league, twice as many as anyone else, and his total of 173 saves was the most of any goalkeeper in the top eight leagues.",
      "Given that information, it is perhaps not so surprising that the advanced metrics also suggest he was the outstanding performer. Based on the expected-goals data, he prevented half a goal every 90 minutes - more than any other keeper in Europe.",
      "He has earned a reputation as a ball-playing goalkeeper with a real range of passes at his disposal, although the statistics suggest he is not quite so accustomed to rushing off his line as regularly as some of the more high-profile sweeper-keepers around.",
      "In Belgium, his list of admirers include former national team goalkeepers Michel Preud'homme and Simon Mignolet but the step up to playing for Manchester United will still be a test of technique and temperament for this talented 23-year-old prospect.",
      "\"If your goalkeeper is making mistakes, it undermines everything that you do. And at Old Trafford, it's the most unforgiving ground for goalkeepers.",
      "\"The Manchester United goalkeeper spot is the toughest position in English football, bar none. If you give goals away at United as a keeper, you'll be scrutinised heavily.",
      "\"It's not about never making mistakes - it's about how you recover from them, your body language, and whether you look authoritative. [Onana and Bayindir] don't fill that role.\""

      "Premier League spending passed the £3bn mark in a record-breaking window capped by Alexander Isak's £125m move from Newcastle to Liverpool; Isak was one of numerous strikers to move for big money as clubs sought to add firepower",
      "Tuesday 2 September 2025 16:02, UK",
      "",
      "Premier League clubs spent more than £3bn on new signings in total, shattering the previous record of £2.44bn set in 2023.",
      "Clubs also set a record for the amount of money recouped from player sales at £1.8bn. The buying and selling added up to an all-time-high net spend of £1.2bn.",
      "Liverpool spent the most at a record-breaking £446.5m but Arsenal had the highest net spend at £257m, followed by Liverpool at £218.4m, then Spurs and Manchester United.",
      "At the other end of the scale, Bournemouth emerged from the window £65.8m in the black after selling a raft of star players, including defenders Dean Huijsen, Milos Kerkez and Illia Zabarnyi.",
      "Isak was the most expensive signing of the window at a British-record £125m, followed by Florian Wirtz at £116.5m, while Hugo Ekitike (£79m, Eintracht Frankfurt to Liverpool), Benjamin Sesko (£73.7m, RB Leipzig to Man Utd), and Bryan Mbeumo (£71m, Brentford to Man Utd) also made big-money moves.Adam Smith",
      "It seemed top-level football's evolution was leaving the traditional striker behind as recently as a few years ago. This summer's transfer window underlines how quickly the game can change. Reports of the death of the No 9 have been greatly exaggerated.",
      "In a record-breaking summer, spending by Premier League clubs on forwards vastly outweighed other positions. The rush to add firepower was led by the elite clubs. Manchester City were the only member of the so-called big six not to sign a striker having started the resurgence with Erling Haaland.",
      "Liverpool spent more than £200m on Alexander Isak and Hugo Ekitike. Chelsea invested £90m in Joao Pedro and Liam Delap. Arsenal and Manchester United went for Viktor Gyokeres and Benjamin Sesko at £63.5m and £73.7m respectively. Spurs struck a late loan deal to sign Randal Kolo Muani from Paris Saint-Germain.",
      "Newcastle finally sanctioned the departure of Isak to Liverpool as they completed the £55m signing of Yoane Wissa from Brentford having already brought in Nick Woltemade for £69m from Stuttgart.",
      "Further down the league, Wolves kept Jorgen Strand Larsen and added another target man in Tolu Arokodare from Genk for £23.4m. Brighton spent £31.4m on Charalampos Kostoulas from Olympiakos, while Nottingham Forest and Everton spent similar sums on Arnaud Kalimeundo and Thierno Barry.",
      "The No 9 is back in fashion.Nick Wright",
      "It was the summer of striker statements, Alexander Isak and Yoane Wissa both speaking out - one of them in the hope of leaving Newcastle United and the other in the hope of joining. Ultimately, both got their wish, reminding us all that player power still exists.",
      "\"I believe the club are unduly standing in my way,\" announced Wissa of Brentford's stance. \"When promises are broken and trust is lost, the relationship cannot continue,\" argued Isak. Newcastle were quick to respond that no promise had ever been made.",
      "There are those who would gladly have refused Isak his move to Liverpool and allowed the Swede to sit out his contract, effectively putting his career on hold. The logic goes that this would have sent out a strong message that Newcastle could not be bullied.",
      "Given the vast resources of the Saudi owners, this would have been an option. But profit and sustainability rules mean that while they could afford it, they could not afford to have their budgets slashed, damaging the ability of the club to compete as it might.",
      "And so, player power endures. With that in mind, spare a thought for Jorgen Strand Larsen, the Wolves striker wanted by Newcastle who was not able to get his move. \"I know him very well,\" said Vitor Pereira, the Wolves boss. \"He will never force [a move].\"",
      "The result is that while Strand Larsen faces what looks likely to be a relegation battle, Wissa is preparing to take on Barcelona in the Champions League. The actions of those players who withhold their labour might be distasteful. But they can certainly pay off.Adam Bate",
      "The Premier League clubs outside the traditional top six recognise they are unable to compete with the financial power of those in it. They know they have to be smart in their recruitment to find an edge.",
      "Brentford and Brighton are probably the most prominent examples of how to succeed in that respect - to punch above their weight and, later down the line, make a handsome profit.",
      "So-called bigger clubs had already cottoned on to this approach - but this summer, there have been major raids, from clubs both at home and abroad.",
      "Bournemouth's defence was gutted to the tune of almost £150m as Dean Huijsen, Milos Kerkez and Illia Zabarnyi were poached by Real Madrid, Liverpool and Paris Saint-Germain respectively. Brentford's dynamic duo of Bryan Mbeumo and Yoane Wissa were sold for over £120m. Premier League clubs are increasingly buying from rivals.",
      "Brighton sold Joao Pedro to Chelsea for £60m, Crystal Palace let Eberechi Eze go to Arsenal for £67.5m and Wolves made £95.8m selling Matheus Cunha and Rayan Ait-Nouri to Manchester United and Manchester City respectively.",
      "The buying clubs have the financial clout to be able to be reactive, but many of these moves hardly came as a surprise to the selling clubs, so succession plans will have been in place, funds wisely reinvested.",
      "And as long as the smart recruitment continues, the cycle will go on.Dan Long",

      "Given that three Everton players were among the scorers at Molineux, Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall picking up an assist to go along with his fine goal, some might be surprised to see Jack Grealish named player of the match again but he just stands out.",
      "He assisted two of the goals, taking his tally for the season to four - which is already double that of his past two seasons at Manchester City. Playing regularly again, it would be no great shock if he tops the Premier League rankings at the end of the season.",
      "But it was the goal for which he was not directly involved that most obviously showcased his brilliance. Having been denied by Jose Sa moments earlier, his vision sent Dewsbury-Hall in behind to set up Iliman Ndiaye to find the back of the net. Class.",
      "Asked about Grealish's improvement, David Moyes said: \"Well, it's nothing to do with me, let me tell you, it's all to do with Jack and his own mentality to be better.\" He added: \"The biggest compliment I can probably give him is he is better than I thought he was.\"Adam Bate",
      "But Liam Delap's injury will undoubtedly sour the mood at Stamford Bridge in the aftermath of the 2-0 win against Fulham.",
      "Enzo Maresca confirmed the striker would be sidelined for weeks after limping off in the first half with a hamstring problem - and now they must navigate a difficult return to the squad for Nicolas Jackson.",
      "The player was in Germany to complete that move and will now need to come to terms with returning to west London, after his head coach had previously sanctioned his exit.",
      "The start to the season has been strong for the Blues but they were not at their best against Fulham. If they want to keep up this strong form and remain at the top of the table, Jackson's contributions will be key.",
      "Difficult games against Brentford, Manchester United and Brighton are on the horizon in the Premier League. Not to mention the first Champions League game of the season against Bayern Munich on September 17, too.",
      "Jackson will likely be playing at the Allianz Arena in the near future - but he'll be wearing blue not red.Patrick Rowe",
      "Amid clear challenges for Manchester United, one name stands out as a potential beacon of light: Bryan Mbeumo.",
      "He was consistently brilliant for Brentford and has wasted no time in slotting in perfectly in Ruben Amorim's formation. Others have floundered wearing the United strip after big-money moves but Mbeumo is relishing the responsibility based on his output in his three Premier League appearances.",
      "For a United side searching for the right balance and cutting edge, Mbeumo's attributes are exactly what they need in that he is direct, strong and capable of changing defence into attack with quick movements.",
      "His ability to drift between the full-back and centre-back channel created havoc for Burnley with Bruno Fernandes pinging him great service that was exploited on regular occasions, especially in the first half.",
      "United have been in search of a player who can bring more dynamic attacking options to the table and in Mbeumo they may just have found him.Lewis Jones",
      "This 1-0 home defeat to Bournemouth was a reality check for Tottenham head coach Thomas Frank.",
      "After the highs of winning at Manchester City, Spurs put in a dreadful display against Bournemouth that has punctured the air of optimism under the Dane, with the full-time whistle met by boos.",
      "One fan departing the stadium at full-time shouted: 'same old Spurs', and it was considering they came into this with a chance of moving top and maintaining a perfect start.",
      "Those wins against Burnley and Man City proved a false dawn as Spurs looked clueless against an outstanding Bournemouth.",
      "On the day Spurs found out their fixture dates for the Champions League, you would have thought Bournemouth were the team to be facing Villarreal at home on September 16, such was the dominance and slickness in their display.",
      "A toothless Spurs had just five shots against the Cherries, while Frank's side failed to have a single shot in the first half of a Premier League home game since February 2020.",
      "How Frank could have done with his new £51m signing Xavi Simons on Saturday afternoon.",
      "Frank said of Simons at his post-match press conference: \"Sometimes you need a player that can do something a little bit out of nothing, go past a player, produce a cross, a shot, a pass, with that extra quality that you need on the day, and that's what I think he can bring.\"",
      "Spurs will desperately be hoping the Netherlands international can add some sparkle and guile, because the boos will only get louder if Tottenham put in more performances like this.Declan Olley",
      "It would have been interesting to hear the thoughts of new signing Nick Woltemade as he watched Newcastle's goalless draw at Elland Road.",
      "But he was not watching the Magpies at their best. Without the creative sparks of Anthony Gordon and Alexander Isak - who may still leave the club by 7pm on Monday - and missing the string-pulling of Joelinton, Newcastle fell a bit flat.",
      "The absences were noticeable. There were just eight shots, two on target and no big chances created. As they did in their opening game against Aston Villa, there was a lack of goals that desperately needs to be filled.",
      "And that could be answered easily after the international break. Woltemade will be in line for a debut, while Gordon and Joelinton's returns will likely not be far behind.",
      "And Isak could still be in those famous white and black stripes, although that situation may take a little more time to resolve. Watch this space.Charlotte Marsh",
      "Before facing Everton in their opening game of the Premier League season, Leeds boss Daniel Farke said the atmosphere at Elland Road would be a huge part of them being able to beat the drop.",
      "And he's being proved right.",
      "In their two home games, Leeds are unbeaten, winning against Everton and now drawing against Newcastle. Admittedly, neither were at their best, but when you are newly promoted and points mean prizes, Leeds will not mind.",
      "Elland Road has long had a reputation for being a difficult place to play when the fans are in full voice. Whatever fate may have befallen their team, Leeds fans have never stopped making their ground a horrible place for opposing teams.",
      "In fact, all three of the promoted clubs are giving their visitors something to think about. None of them have lost at home yet this season.",
      "If Leeds are to beat the drop - and based on the evidence so far, that is a real possibility - then the home form will be key in that. So far, so good.Charlotte Marsh",
      "Inevitably, Marco Silva cut a frustrated figure on the touchline for the vast majority of the game at Stamford Bridge. Pacing up and down the touchline, arguing his team's case to officials and constantly shaking his head.",
      "At half-time, he almost resisted the urge to approach Rob Jones on the pitch and pulled himself back down the tunnel. Across the second half, you could even see him stewing in the dugout, laughing to himself in disbelief following the lengthy VAR delay that went against his side.",
      "However, in his post-match press conference, he gathered himself and, before discussing the grievances he had from the game, he chose to focus on the positives.",
      "Fulham were the better side in the first half; they deserved their lead which got snatched away from them and you could tell they were deflated after the restart.",
      "But he was right to focus on the positives. The transfer window has been difficult to navigate, with just one signing so far, but his side have impressed in the early stages of the season, despite not having the points to show for it.",
      "They battled back against Brighton. They did the same against Manchester United and could have won that fixture quite easily. They should have walked away with something from this game.",
      "When it rains, it pours. Luck is against them at the moment, but they have the quality in this side, as well as the potential new recruits that Silva expects to arrive before Deadline Day, that will turn that in their favour soon enough.Patrick Rowe",
      "Wilson Isidor will understandably steal the headlines for Sunderland with his dramatic late winner. However, while the super-sub will take the spotlight, a glimmer remains on the real star of the show for the Black Cats.",
      "Enzo Le Fee was arguably the most important piece of the puzzle in Regis Le Bris' play-off winners last season, but in order to adjust to Premier League football, an overhaul of the squad has meant the midfielder has played a lesser role to start the season.",
      "Across the win against West Ham and the defeat to Burnley, Le Fee managed a combined 40 minutes of play. Yet, his head coach backed him to start over Simon Adingra and the Frenchman made sure to repay the faith shown in him.",
      "Despite operating off the left-hand side, Le Fee effectively acted as an added midfield player when Sunderland transitioned into their defensive phases. His work rate was hard to top, epitomised in the first half as he sprinted half the length of the pitch to produce an immaculate slide tackle to stop a Brentford break right in its tracks.",
      "His work off the ball was eventually awarded with a goal, showing Kevin Schade how to finish from the penalty spot. But what he produced throughout the contest was a reminder to those with a short-term memory why he quickly became beloved at the Stadium of Light last season.Callum Bishop",
      "Brentford looked a demoralised outfit after Sunderland's last-minute heroics put them to the sword on Wearside. But the biggest turning point came far earlier when Kevin Schade missed a penalty for the Bees early in the second half.",
      "The decision for Schade to take it was a strange one. Igor Thiago - Brentford's big-money striker who scored a penalty against Forest in the Bees' opening fixture - seemed the obvious choice from the spot. But Schade, who has never scored a penalty in his professional career, stepped up instead. He produced a weak effort, inviting Roefs to save and send the Stadium of Light wild.",
      "Brentford boss Keith Andrews had implored before the game that any opportunity to let the lively home fans into the game was to be avoided. But that's exactly what Schade's miss prompted. Brentford cowered in big moments from then on, conceding just three minutes after Thiago netted their eventual opener and losing in stoppage time to a Wilson Isidor winner.",
      "Asked about the penalty dilemma after the game, Andrews said that he had been conscious of the fact the Bees lost their usual penalty taker in Bryan Mbeumo over the summer. Yet, the fact that a former set-piece coach hasn't identified a first choice in the Cameroonian's place makes for a rather surprising admission that could continue to prove costly.Noah Langford",
      "Matheus Cunha and Rayan Ait-Nouri were always going to be big losses alongside Nelson Semedo. At present, the drop off in class is all too evident. Wolves pushed for an equaliser, causing some chaos, but a point would have been scarcely deserved.",
      "Pumping long balls towards the giant Sasa Kalajdzic looked the best bet, but Wolves do not have players of the quality of Grealish or Ndiaye in the final third and it shows. It will be a struggle even with Jorgen Strand Larsen. Without him, hopes could be dashed.",
      "That seems to be the sentiment among supporters who have seen their side extricate themselves from trouble in two of the past three seasons but see a side whose trajectory is very apparent. \"Back the team or sell the club,\" they sang to the owners.",
      "Asked in the press conference about those chants and whether he feels backed, Vitor Pereira said: \"They are trying to help the team. I hope until the end of the market they try to add at least two players to help us because we need more solutions. Especially in attack.\"Adam Bate",
      "Super 6 are starting the season by guaranteeing a £1,000,000 winner! Play for free."
