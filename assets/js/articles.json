      "Manchester United captain Bruno Fernandes is reportedly considering leaving the club after previously calling for the hierarchy to buck up their ideas in the transfer market. The Portuguese star put pen to paper on a new deal with the Red Devils in August of last year.",
      "However, the extension only materialised after Fernandes made it clear to United co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe that he demanded the club recruit top-class players in order to compete with the very best.",
      "Yet United's current pull in the market is now under threat, meaning the midfielder is believed to be weighing up the decision to move on, with Saudi Pro League side Al-Hilal said to be circling him.",
      "United's loss in the Europa League final to Tottenham Hotspur and their subsequent inability to offer European football next season means luring some of the game's biggest stars to Old Trafford may prove difficult. Mounting financial concerns will also provide a hurdle for Ruben Amorim this summer.",
      "Speaking to the club's website upon signing his contract extension, Fernandes said: \"The club knew that I want to compete with the best teams. They knew that we needed to improve the team. And I think that we’re doing that.",
      "\"I said to the, ‘I don’t need you to promise me that we’re going to win the league, because no one can promise that. But at least that we will have a team to compete and be competitive throughout the season, to try to achieve silverware and to compete at the highest levels.'\"",
      "Under former manager Erik ten Hag, United did hold their end of the deal last summer. Joshua Zirkzee, Leny Yoro, Matthijs de Ligt, Manuel Ugarte and Noussair Mazraoui were brought in for a combined fee believed to be in the region of £200million.",
      "However, Amorim has long been aware funds will likely be tight this summer. In a move that could signal some ambition to Fernandes, it's understood that United are looking to wrap up a £62.5m deal for Wolves forward Matheus Cunha.",
      "Regardless, Fernandes' agent, Miguel Pinho, is already believed to have held discussions with Al-Hilal about a stunning £100m transfer. United have also refused to rule out his possible sale after insisting that every member of their underperforming squad is up for sale.",
      "Al-Hilal are eager to conclude a deal quickly so Fernandes, 30, can play for them in the Club World Cup in the United States next month. After United's Europa League final defeat, Fernandes cast doubt on his future by suggesting the club could \"cash in\" on him.",
      "United signed Fernandes from Sporting CP in January 2020 for a fee rising to £67.7million. He was United's top scorer in 2024/25 with 19 goals and he retained the Sir Matt Busby Player of the Year award - an accolade he has won in four out of his six seasons at the club.",
      "United's head coach also underlined the player's significance this week. \"[Fernandes] is really important for us and what we want to build for the team. We talk about this many times,\" Amorim said.",
      "\"You can see by his performances. You can see by his leadership. You can see the passion he has for the game. In difficult moments, Bruno is the guy who takes responsibility. He should do because he is the captain.\""

      "Harry Maguire has brutally admitted that 'a lot of players' will be leaving Manchester United this summer. United endured an awful season, finishing 15th in the Premier League and failing to win a major trophy.",
      "It means they will be without European football next season, which is set to massively restrict their business this summer. Boss Ruben Amorim is desperate to overhaul his squad, with Matheus Cunha already on his way in for £62.5million.",
      "Further signings are expected, but sales will almost certainly be needed to ensure United comply with profit and sustainability rules. The Red Devils have embarked on a post-season tour of Malaysia to boost the coffers.",
      "That led to the embarrassing defeat to ASEAN All-Stars on Wednesday. Maguire, along with team-mates Andre Onana and Diogo Dalot, were then sent to India to attend commercial activities.",
      "Maguire captained United in their defeat to the All-Stars, having had his contract extended earlier this year. But the Englishman is not expecting many of his team-mates to stick around this summer.",
      "\"We will make a lot of changes in the summer at the club,\" Maguire said. \"There will be a lot of players who leave and hopefully a lot of players will come in. That’s down to the club to make sure they get that right.",
      "\"It’s down to us players to make sure that we are the ones that are involved. Each player has to take responsibility. This season has not been good. We know the criticism is going to be there and we have to accept it.",
      "\"It’s part and parcel of playing for one of the biggest in the world. When you play for Manchester United and have a bad year, the scrutiny just comes and comes... The whole world jumps on it, not just the Manchester United fans. The others as well. It can spiral.”",
      "Boss Amorim has admitted the tour is taking place at a 'really hard' time given his side's struggles. But he urged them to push through the criticism after the Red Devils were booed off following Wednesday's defeat.",
      "\"I think everybody understands it's a really hard context because we had the season we had, and it's hard in this moment to face the fans around the world. We want to finish this season but at the same time we want to give something to the fans,\" he said.",
      "\"If there's one thing that's really important in this club, it's that we need to face our fans in this moment. Let's focus on all the game. Every time a player for Manchester United touched the ball, especially in the beginning, the stadium went crazy.",
      "\"The environment was really good. We did our lap at the end and the fans were supporting our team, so I think it was more supportive than the opposite.\""

      "Florian Wirtz has been told Arne Slot is a better manager than Erik ten Hag as the Liverpool boss was revealed to have played a major role in the German's potential move to Anfield. The future of the Bayer Leverkusen star was already set to be a major talking point this summer with the Premier League champions, Bayern Munich, and Manchester City all in the hunt for the 22-year-old.",
      "Conversations surrounding Wirtz's next move indicated that a transfer to the German champions was most likely until he conducted a meeting with Slot, alongside his father and agent, Hans-Joachim Wirtz.",
      "The intervention from the Reds boss was said to have proved critical in the attacking midfielder deciding to snub Bayern in order to move abroad for the first time in his career.",
      "According to Bild, the meeting on May 13 saw Slot provide Wirtz with a clear picture of where he'll fit within his title-winning team and was promised of a starring role in the side's attack.",
      "Becoming enamoured with promises of a central role within one of the world's best teams, as well as being informed of the fervent support that the club possesses from their fans, resulted in Wirtz's father informing Bayern executives Uli Hoeness and Max Eberl that it was Liverpool who had won the race for his son's signature.",
      "Wirtz could have ended up playing for Ten Hag next season, had he chosen to remain with Leverkusen, after the former Manchester United boss was announced as their new manager following the departure of Xabi Alonso to Real Madrid.",
      "However, a move to Liverpool will see the Wirtz team up with the better manager, according to Mark Diemers. The Cambuur midfielder enjoyed spells playing under both managers, having spent a brief period alongside the ex-United boss at Utrecht before joining Slot during his time at Feyenoord.",
      "Best positioned to give an opinion on the managerial abilities of both men, the 31-year-old had a clear opinion when admitting who he enjoyed working with more. \"I choose Arne Slot,\" he told ESPN Netherlands last year when asked about the best manager he has worked with.",
      "\"I can only talk from my time. I found Ten Hag insanely good tactically, so were his training sessions. I just didn’t think he was very good, at that time, on a human level. But that was already six or seven years ago. I thought Slot was a lot stronger on a human level.",
      "\"Look at what kind of clubs [Ten Hag] has worked at, so he must also have qualities on a human level. I still have contact with him via WhatsApp. Then he also comes across as very friendly to me. He will undoubtedly have grown on a human level as well.\"",
      "Despite the lack of consistent success in Manchester – and some issues in the dressing room – Ten Hag still managed to win two trophies in his time at the club as he made sure to maintain his status as a manager who is adept in capturing silverware.",
      "Ten Hag also won plaudits for his style of play at Ajax, which encouraged United to initially make a move for the 55-year-old. However, it's Slot who has arguably managed to cement himself as the better of the two in recent times following title successes with Feyenoord and, of course, Liverpool in his first season in as boss of the Premier League club."

      "Italy is known for romance, but a punch in the face was the Inter Milan ultras' way of expressing their love for Paul Ince. Fortunately for the ex-Manchester United and Liverpool star, he was not the one left tasting iron.",
      "In 1995, Ince departed Old Trafford and moved to the San Siro, where he shared a dressing room with the likes of Roberto Carlos, Ivan Zamorano, Nicola Berti and many others. It didn't take long for Ince to establish himself in Serie A. He dominated the midfield while wearing the No. 8 shirt of the Nerazzurri, and their iconic fan base took him in as one of their own - quite literally on one occasion.",
      "Like their most extreme supporters, who light up the stands with flares as their drums and megaphones radiate chaos around stadiums in Europe, Ince will be willing Inter on in the Champions League final against Paris Saint-Germain.",
      "Italian clubs have their own unique way of showing their love for players, as Ince found out during his time in the capital. Yet, the endearment they paid to him had unfortunate and painful ramifications for one poor ultra.",
      "\"I got sent off against someone, unlike me. I missed a couple of games. We were playing against some team, I think it was Sampdoria or someone like that. I said to my best mate, who played for Inter, 'I’m going to spend a game upstairs with the ultras.'",
      "Watch our full Champions League final interview with Paul Ince and Claude Makelele here",
      "\"I spoke to the ultras and this bossman came down with two of his sidekicks and took me all the way up to where all the ultras are. Some geezer went to grab me to say, 'Ah, Paul Ince.'",
      "\"The ultra turned around and smashed him straight in the nose. This poor geezer’s nose was like that (mimicking a nose that has been flattened). I thought, 'Wow.’ They were like, 'Don’t touch Paul Ince, nobody touches Paul Ince.'\"",
      "Seeing a man take a huge hook to the nose would normally be anybody's cue to leave the area, but the blue and black lions den that is the Internazionale ultras is no normal place.",
      "Ince continued to follow the head ultra, while other fans in the area cleared a path and maybe avoided looking at the Englishman. While that supporter was left tasting their own blood, the ex-England international was hooked on the adrenaline rush of being with the fanbase - and nearly 30 years later, there's only one thing Ince wants to do.",
      "He added: \"They took me right to the front, right up to the nets and they were singing and chanting, it was the best atmosphere ever. To this day, I want to do it again, I’d love to do it again. I did not get many red cards in the Premier League. But in Italy, it was different. Players were rolling over, feigning injuries.",
      "\"I got sent off about three times, which was very rare for me. I was a strong tackler, but in Italy, I got sent off a lot. I think the fans loved me because of that. The fans were devastated when I left. The fans still love me and still idolise me, so it was great.”",
      "He would go on to leave Inter and return to Liverpool after two seasons, in a move that broke the hearts of the Italian giants and their ultras. Family reasons is what drove Ince back to England. Despite his exit, he is still admired by fans at the club to this day, so it's hard to imagine he'd struggle to secure another invite from the ultras.",
      "Paul Ince was speaking on behalf of bet365, the official global partner of the UEFA Champions League, which is hosting its Big Ticket Giveaway Game this Friday 30th May in Munich from 4pm, where fans have the chance to win tickets to the UEFA Champions League final.

      "And when quizzed about his plans for the upcoming season, Van Nistelrooy confessed: “I still have to wait at least to have a conversation on a future together or not. Before that, you cannot start planning. I need to speak to be able to get a feeling on hopes. It’s all dependent on that.”",
      "Van Nistelrooy’s state of limbo has fuelled speculation that he may be replaced by Russell Martin, formerly of Southampton, as the Foxes look for a manager with a prior history of clinching promotion to the Premier League.",
      "Van Nistelrooy has endured a disastrous tenure since replacing Steve Cooper at the King Power Stadium in late November, which saw their relegation to the Championship confirmed in April.",
      "The Foxes were one point clear of the relegation zone at the time of his appointment but a dreadful run of form followed, which saw them lose a whopping 16 games from 18 played between December and February.",
      "And it’s not the first time Van Nistelrooy has found himself at odds with club bosses. The Manchester United legend quit his old job as PSV boss in May 2023 over a lack of support from the Dutch giants just a year after taking charge of the senior side.",
      "It came as somewhat of a surprise, given that he'd won a Johan Cruyff Shield and a TOTO KNVB Beker, while also looking set to finish in second place in the Eredivisie.",
      "PSV at the time alluded to his falling out with the board, releasing a statement, which read: \"Van Nistelrooy told the first-team squad and coaching staff that he would be stepping down with immediate effect, due to a lack of support within the club.",
      "\"PSV regrets his decision and is grateful to him for winning the Johan Cruijff Shield and the Dutch Cup, and hopes to finish the season in second place.\"",
      "Van Nistelrooy’s next job came when he was appointed as Erik ten Hag's assistant ahead of the 2024/25 season. After a poor start to the campaign led to Ten Hag's dismissal, Van Nistelrooy took over in an interim capacity.",
      "The former Netherlands striker, however, was left feeling \"disappointed\" and \"hurt\" after being told to pack his bags by United's incoming boss, Ruben Amorim, who brought his own backroom team with him.",
      "Meanwhile, Van Nistelrooy’s potential successor, Martin, was sacked by the Saints in December and just 16 games into the Premier League season, having overseen an astonishing 13 defeats. Martin has also been touted for the vacant managerial position at Rangers.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more."

      "Few forwards are in as high demand as Viktor Gyokeres this summer, and Sweden manager Jon Dahl Tomasson is all too aware of that fact. But the surge of interest in his team's top talisman means he's ready to break his usual habit of advising the player on his transfer.",
      "Among the interested parties are Premier League heavyweights like Arsenal and Manchester United. Correio da Manha reported the Gunners flew a contingent to Portugal for talks with the player's agent this week, while a move to Old Trafford would see Gyokeres reunite with former Sporting CP boss Ruben Amorim.",
      "Tomasson has admitted he usually likes to give players input on where to move, whether that be to benefit them in terms of playing time or stylistically. But the media circus that's erupted around Gyokeres has convinced him to remain out of the equation, at least in public.",
      "The former Blackburn boss, who took charge of Sweden's national team in 2024, has more of an inside scoop on the matter than most. But the 48-year-old was unwilling when asked if he would divulge whether he has a preference in where Gyokeres moves.",
      "\"No, of course not,\" he said while speaking to Swedish outlet Aftonbladet from the national team's training ground. \"Because then it would be blown up like this [stretches arms].\"",
      "Like most national team coaches, Tomasson said he prefers to select players who are getting regular minutes for their respective clubs. He added that he regularly speaks to his players about \"what would be a good and bad club,\" but it appears an exception will be made in Gyokeres' case, unless he reaches out for advice.",
      "\"There are definitely players changing clubs! We know that each year,\" he continued. \"If you look at each player, you need to make the right choice.",
      "\"You actually don't know if it's the right choice before you're at the club. You have family as well you have to have in mind. It's not easy, but at the end of the day, that's [football].\"",
      "Gyokeres, who turns 27 on Wednesday, is arguably the form frontman in Europe after scoring 97 goals in 102 outings for Sporting. And those in his inner circle have been unabashed in admitting they want him to remain in Lisbon.",
      "The player's uncle, Chris, revealed his nephew's summer prospects were a hot topic of discussion at a recent family dinner. And he left no doubt as to where he'd like to see the former Coventry talent end up next season.",
      "\"Yes, very much,\" he told Sport.TV, when asked if he and the family felt connected to Lisbon. \"Yesterday at dinner, we decided that he has to stay.\"",
      "It was during the recent celebrations at the Taca de Portugal final that Gyokeres' girlfriend also gave her take on the situation. And actress Ines Aguiar was quoted saying she \"promised\" to do her utmost to convince him to stay at Sporting for a third campaign."

Saudi sources have reportedly told Fernandes that the offer is a one-time opportunity, with other suggesting that he is 'seriously considering' a move - albeit he remains relaxed about the situation.",

      "For years, Wesley Sneijder was the Premier League's elusive phantom. The Inter Milan and Netherlands icon was perpetually linked with moves to England, with Manchester United, Liverpool and others investing serious time and effort in pursuit of the mercurial midfielder.",
      "In his prime, Sneijder was a creative force in world football, with his sublime blend of technical brilliance and lethal goalscoring instinct captivating clubs across Europe. Fresh off orchestrating Inter Milan's historic 2010 Treble and steering the Netherlands to a World Cup final, he was the prize many elite clubs coveted.",
      "\"At that time, I was considering both. But when you look at my career, all the teams I have played for were playing for something, playing for the title, always in the top three of the league.",
      "\"And at that time, Liverpool were not as great as they are now. Galatasaray was a completely new experience. A different culture, and playing for prizes. So I chose them over Liverpool.\"",
      "His decision nearly haunted him, as the Reds mounted a thrilling, albeit doomed, Premier League title charge in 2013/14 under Brendan Rodgers, derailed by Steven Gerrard's infamous slip against Chelsea. In Istanbul, Sneijder's gamble paid dividends, as he powered Galatasaray to eight major trophies, including two Super Lig titles and three Turkish Cups. Yet, the siren call of the Premier League lingered.",
      "Reflecting on the Manchester United saga, Sneijder revealed that talks with the Red Devils were gaining momentum in 2010, only to collapse abruptly. It wasn't until years later, during a chance encounter between his father and legendary former United manager Sir Alex Ferguson, that the truth behind the failed transfer emerged, shedding light on one of modern football's great 'what-ifs.'",
      "\"I didn't know the reason - I didn't ask my agent. He just said they [United] didn't call anymore and I believed it. But many years later, like five or six years later, my father was in Manchester with a friend of his, and they walked into a place where Sir Alex Ferguson was.",
      "\"And he spoke to my father and he said he was interested in me, that he wanted to sign me, but that there was a problem with the agent. So that was the problem - which I didn't know before. That's the information I have now.",
      "\"Obviously, it would have been a great move. After winning everything to go to a big club like Man United would have been amazing. But also, I had a great time at Inter Milan, and after that I had a great move to Galatasaray... it just didn't happen.\"",
      "Sneijder, now 40, launched his storied career at Ajax, honing his craft before a high-profile 2007 transfer to Real Madrid. In his debut season, he clinched the La Liga title, but the arrival of the second Galacticos era - headlined by Cristiano Ronaldo, Kaka, and Karim Benzema - pushed him out in 2009.",
      "Revenge came swiftly, though, as Sneijder, under Jose Mourinho, helped new club Inter clinch a famous Treble, capped by a 2-0 Champions League final triumph over Bayern Munich at the Bernabeu - his former home. After securing six major titles in three-and-a-half years at the San Siro, he joined Galatasaray, before stints at Nice and Qatari outfit Al-Gharafa.",
      "Internationally, Sneijder's 134 caps - a Dutch record - saw him shine at six major tournaments. His pinnacle came at the 2010 World Cup, where he led the Netherlands to the final, claimed joint-top scorer honours, and earned the Silver Ball as the tournament's second-best player.",
      "Sneijder's career, defined by trophies as well as near-misses, remains a testament to his unwavering pursuit of glory over glamour. While the Premier League's allure never truly faded, his choice to chase success in the fervent footballing cauldrons of Milan and Istanbul over England's uncertain promises proved his instinct for winning was as sharp as his playmaking."

      "United are desperate to generate funds for their summer overhaul and Garnacho is on the transfer list along with Marcus Rashford, Antony and Jadon Sancho following their loan spells at other clubs. Garnacho, who is under contract until June 2028, is valued at around £70m after getting 11 goals and 10 assists in 58 games this season.",

      "Alan Shearer has expressed worries about the \"rows\" between Manchester United and Wolves concerning Matheus Cunha's potential transfer to Old Trafford. It's been indicated for some time that the Brazil international will be joining United, but recent hiccups have emerged that could jeopardise the move.",
      "Ruben Amorim has been braced to enter his first summer transfer window at the United helm with limited resources. And funding is sure to suffer further after their defeat against Tottenham in the Europa League final, leaving the club with no European football next season.",
      "United now need to sell certain players before they can afford to spend any significant sums. And Newcastle legend Shearer raised doubts regarding United's prospects of securing Cunha amid recent developments.",
      "\"Who they sell, I don't know. If they need to raise funds then they have a couple of options to do that,\" he told Betfair. \"It looks as if the Cunha deal is going to happen albeit I saw that there's rows in terms of how payments will be made.\"",
      "The transfer saga seems to have taken a positive turn after United agreed to shell out the £62.5m fee in three payments spread over two years. Cunha is now poised to have his medical at Carrington, potentially marking United's most significant acquisition of 2025.",
      "The former RB Leipzig and Atletico Madrid attacker has an impressive record of 33 goals in 92 games for Wolves and offers much-needed versatility up top. Meanwhile, Shearer has cautioned that there's still a hefty amount of squad rebuilding necessary before United can dream of fighting for a top-six finish again.",
      "He continued: \"Man United need an overhaul but it won't happen in one or two transfer windows and that's why, as a player, you have to think long and hard about needing or wanting to go there because it's going to take two or three years to get anywhere near the levels to challenge for the top six again.",
      "\"If funds are going to be tight due to PSR then their assets in [Alejandro] Garnacho and [Bruno] Fernandes may have to be sold to bring funds in. Nothing surprises me with Man United on or off the field anymore because they've been an embarrassment over the last 12 months.\"",
      "Cunha himself has dropped a big hint he's preparing to leave after seemingly bidding farewell to his Wolves supporters. The club's official Instagram account featured a clip of the Molineux faithful serenading the star following their last game of the campaign, and Cunha’s response seemed to indicate plans for departure.",
      "\"I can't thank you enough for so much,\" he wrote in the comments section. And many have interpreted his words as an indication his tenure in the midlands is nearing its conclusion.",
      "Garnacho, 20, has been placed on the transfer list following a fallout with Amorim, who excluded him from the squad that beat Aston Villa on the final day of the season. There's talk United are aiming to bag up to £70m for the youngster, although their negotiating stance seems frail.",
      "United will undoubtedly be keener to cling on to captain Fernandes, who was previously rumoured to be on the radars of Barcelona and Real Madrid. Meanwhile, a move to Saudi Arabia now appears to be the most probable outcome if he were to depart."

      "Manchester United’s failure to sign their 'top target' Florian Wirtz is set to come back to haunt them as Liverpool close in on the German sensation. Liverpool are currently in talks with Bayer Leverkusen after convincing Wirtz and his representatives that his future lies in Merseyside.",
      "The 22-year-old's family recently flew to Liverpool to look at houses in the north west of England, having been impressed with Arne Slot’s vision for him and the Premier League winners going forward.",
      "The Reds have since submitted an opening bid of £85million plus add-ons for the Germany international after receiving the green light from owners Fenway Sports Group. That sum falls short of Leverkusen’s valuation of the player, with the German side understood to be holding out for a deal that would break the Premier League transfer record, set by Chelsea’s £115m move for Moises Caicedo in 2023.",
      "Yet, Wirtz’s preference to join Liverpool over Bayern Munich means the Premier League champions are very much the frontrunners in the race to secure their long-term target’s signature, with negotiations between the two clubs continuing and an agreement likely very soon.",
      "Such news will be particularly poorly received in certain Manchester circles after they passed up the opportunity to sign him three-and-a-half years ago.",
      "During Ralf Rangnick’s brief spell in charge at Old Trafford, the then-interim manager compiled a lengthy list of his top transfer targets for the United hierarchy to bring in.",
      "Rangnick was appointed in December 2021 and was expected to start a two-year consultancy gig once a permanent successor was identified at the end of the season. Ahead of his first transfer window at the helm in January 2022, his wishlist included the likes of Josko Gvardiol, Christopher Nkunku and Erling Haaland.",
      "But an 18-year-old Wirtz was the German’s priority target. Wirtz at the time was enjoying a meteoric rise at Leverkusen, becoming the club’s youngest ever player in the Bundesliga with his debut coming shortly after his 17th birthday in March 2020. With eight goals and eight assists the following season, he earned a call-up to the senior Germany squad in March 2021.",
      "Rangnick had hoped the draw of the Premier League and Old Trafford could persuade Wirtz to join United. Reports claimed a transfer fee of £60m would have been sufficient to convince Leverkusen to part ways.",
      "United, however, opted against making any signings in January 2022, much to the frustration of Rangnick. And the interim boss left the club in May after winning just 11 of his 31 games, ending the Red Devils’ pursuit of Wirtz.",
      "Since then, the attacking-midfielder has gone on to become one of European football’s brightest talents thanks to his performances under Xabi Alonso. He played a pivotal role as Leverkusen completed an unbeaten domestic double last season, which put him on the radar of clubs like Bayern Munich, Manchester City and Chelsea.",
      "Newly-crowned German champions Bayern were quietly confident that they could complete a deal this summer for Wirtz, who is under contract with Leverkusen until 2027. However, that fell apart after Wirtz and his parents – who represent him in negotiations – met with Bayern chief Max Eberl, club supremo Uli Hoeness and head coach Vincent Kompany.",
      "It is understood that they left the meeting feeling underwhelmed and with a lack of clarity around Bayern's plans for him. The opposite happened when they met with Liverpool, who impressed due to a depth of knowledge around Wirtz, allowing them to push ahead in the queue.",
      "Leverkusen’s managing director Simon Rolfes this week confirmed that Liverpool hold “concrete interest” in him. \"[Wirtz is] one of our players,\" Rolfes said at the press conference to unveil new head coach Erik ten Hag on Monday. \"Naturally, there’s a lot of interest. There’s concrete interest from Liverpool but there’s no more to say right now. Florian is our player.”",
      "The blockbuster deal for Wirtz is just one part of Liverpool’s plans for the summer transfer window, with his Leverkusen team-mate Jeremie Frimpong also heading for Anfield in a £29.5m deal, while Bournemouth defender Milos Kerkez is also of interest. Their potential arrivals is clear evidence of the pulling power of winning, with Slot able to convince players following his Premier League title victory.",
      "On the plus side for United and Ruben Amorim, they are edging close to completing the signing of Matheus Cunha from Wolves for £62.5m, with a medical on the way for the Brazilian attacker.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more."

      "Alejandro Garnacho needs to stop moaning about his situation at Manchester United and go elsewhere to prove their struggles are not down to him. That’s the opinion of former United midfielder Gordon Strachan, who has urged the club to sell Garnacho at the earliest opportunity in the summer transfer window.",
      "Garnacho is an unwilling participant on United’s post-season tour to Malaysia and Hong Kong and is desperate to leave the club following a miserable end to the season. United finished 15th in the Premier League and lost the Europa League final to Tottenham and will undergo a major squad overhaul in the coming months.",
      "Garnacho admitted the season had been “s***” and hinted at a summer departure after the loss in Bilbao. He attracted interest from Chelsea and Napoli in January and the Italian club are expected to open talks with United over a transfer soon.",
      "That would be a good move for all parties involved, according to ex-manager Strachan, who slammed Garnacho’s attitude. \"Garnacho's got to go. I think he shows a lack of maturity and needs a real wake-up call. Manchester United is far too good of a club to listen to him whingeing and whining all the time,” he told Esports Insider.",
      "\"You wonder what the players at Manchester United are thinking about Alejandro Garnacho’s actions. He should be looking after his team-mates after they lost the Europa League final, not promoting himself with his comments.",
      "\"If he doesn’t want to be a team player then I think it’s best he just goes somewhere else. If the manager decides he's not picking you, you've got to think of the reason, and quite often that starts by looking at yourself.",
      "\"In life the best thing to do when something isn't going your way, or you have issues, is to look at yourself and think whether it stems from you. It's rare that players take that stance anymore, and look at themselves before whining about their problems.\"",
      "Napoli sporting director Giovanni Manna will reportedly meet United officials in the coming weeks to begin the negotiation process over Garnacho. The Italian champions saw a £40million bid rejected in January and have been told that United value the Argentina international at closer to £70m.",
      "The club are hoping to net a decent transfer fee, given the 20-year-old is under contract until June 2028 and he contributed 11 goals and 10 assists in 58 games this season.",

      "Follow below for live match updates from the Hong Kong Stadium.",
      "It was an achievement for Lacey just to be out here, never mind come on in one game and start in another. He should have got a goal and that will be another learning curve. What he doesn't need is some ridiculous overhyping that has followed him for a few years already.",
      "Amorim makes two changes with less than 30 minutes on the clock;",
      "OFF: Casemiro & Lacey",
      "ON: T. Fletcher & Kone",
      "Both sets of players have just come across to the touchline to get take some liquids on board. It is not as warm as it was in Malaysia, but it is by no means cool in Hong Kong.",
      "And, of course, United go behind. For the umpteenth time this season, they have been impotent in front of goal before going 1-0 down.",
      "Heaton drop-kicked the ball in anger after he fished it out of the net. He knows it was an error by him. A really poor goal to concede.",
      "Hong Kong take the lead with their first shot on target. Juninho strikes from distance and it catches Heaton out at the near post.",
      "It's an error from the goalkeeper, who had had nothing to do prior to that.",
      "Lacey has not been involved much in the build-up but positioned himself well for that chance that he screwed wide. United have played enterprisingly without scoring, which is a familiar story.",
      "The stadium has filled up more and is more than half-full now, at the very least.",
      "That was wonderful play from Garnacho, who has been lively so far, to get to the byline and cut the ball back for Lacey, who arrived late. He connected with the ball but he didn't get the cleanest of contact and it goes wide.",
      "It sounded suspiciously like a fan wielding a megaphone shouted, \"Garnacho, you’re f*****g s**t.\" Garnacho, who takes the slightest thing to heart, was soon on his haunches. It can't be out of exhaustion as the temperatures are so cool here. He seemed lively enough then when he forced a save.",
      "Fernandes takes aim with a free-kick from distance that requires a save from Hong Kong goalkeeper Tee, who palmed it away. It eventually went behind for a corner that came to nothing.",
      "Garnacho has got the ball stuck under his feet on a few occasions already, although he is linking up well with Amass and Fernandes down the left channel. Amass looks desperate to impress. He is wasting no time to sprint forward when Garnacho picks up the ball.",
      "United have played with more intensity already than they did in 90 minutes in Kuala Lumpur. Fernandes and Casemiro have just been bickering over something, possibly the latter straying offside for his disallowed goal. A crowdpleasing start so far from United.",
      "Casemiro heads in from a Fernandes free-kick, thinking he has given United an early lead, but he is flagged offside and it doesn't count.",
      "Hojlund lost his first duel and there were already murmurs of despair. These fans around us have clearly been tuning in frequently this season. He almost got a different reaction with that opportunity.",
      "Amorim is trying to give him some confidence by playing him in these games to increase his chances of scoring.",

      "The contest is underway at the Hong Kong Stadium.",
      "Bruno Fernandes played down the impact of the humid conditions on Wednesday, but the temperature didn't make it easy to play with intensity. The rain is coming down in Hong Kong, so it should feel like home.",
      "The support in Malaysia was much more enthusiastic and fervent than here. The stadium is half-empty and United's emergence did not generate a great deal of fanfare.",
      "The two sets of players have just emerged from the tunnel at the Hong Kong Stadium and kick-off is now just moments away.",

      "Stay tuned to this LIVE blog for regular updates and analysis throughout the game.",
      "Dong Fangzhuo's goal here is a reminder of how meaningless friendly matches are and how easily players can be overhyped. Nobody apart from those at Harvard had heard of Facebook back in 2005 yet there was some brief hoopla around Fangzhuo.",
      "Now, you have adolescents talking up players you have never heard of as potential first-teamers when all they've done is had a few kicks in the National League. The player believes his hype, sees his Instagram following swell and all of a sudden he has an air of entitlement when he might not have even turned out for the reserves.",
      "And the ones you have heard of are almost always not ready. Chido Obi is proof of that. Amorim has put him on the bench again today.",
      "The countdown to kick-off at the Hong Kong Stadium is almost over, meaning the teams will be making their way out very shortly.",
      "We will bring you LIVE updates and analysis throughout the game on this dedicated match blog.",
      "This will be Jonny Evans' farewell and also could be a swansong for Bruno Fernandes. A burning question, if Fernandes does leave, is who will be captain. A tumbleweed is trundling along as you ponder that question.",
      "It cannot be Harry Maguire. He has become a better player and captain without the armband. It would also signal more regression. Diogo Dalot has been talked up privately by figures at United but he would be an underwhelming choice. Lisandro Martinez has the makings of a skipper but is injury prone. Matthijs de Ligt captained Ajax impeccably but has only been at United for a season. Andre Onana is a good character but has enough on his plate as it is.",
      "It's really exciting to see Shea Lacey start in the second post-season friendly against Hong Kong. Hopefully he can make a strong impression today and is subsequently included on the pre-season trip to the USA.",
      "Lacey has bags of talent and we're finally seeing him around the first-team, which always felt inevitable.",
      "The rain is getting heavier here and it is such an open stadium that the majority of those sheltered by a roof are not going to stay dry.",
      "This stadium holds 40,000, so it is less than half the size of the cavernous national stadium in Kuala Lumpur. It was a sell-out when United last played here in 2013 under David Moyes, a tour that included exhausting trips to Australia and Japan. When United played here in 2005, Dong Fangzhuo scored and Bryan Glazer was also in attendance shortly after his family's takeover.",

      "With that said, this could potentially be farwell to both of them.",
      "United starting XI vs Hong Kong: Heaton; Fredricson, Evans, Kukonki; Kamason, Casemiro, Fernandes, Amass; Lacey, Garnacho; Hojlund.",

      "\"Even the proven top flight alternatives to Liam Delap, the likes of Brentford star Yoane Wissa and Crystal Palace striker Jean-Philippe Mateta could be financially out of reach for United with Premier League signings often attracting a premium. It means the Reds might have to cast the net further afield in their search for attacking options. And a look at the Bundesliga could provide an answer. A look down the list of top scorers, which is led by Harry Kane, sees the unheralded Jonathan Burkardt in fourth. The striker hit 18 goals last term to fire Mainz into Europe.\"",

      "It all started back in Norway last July with a 1-0 defeat to Rosenborg in their opening pre-season friendly and it ends here in Hong Kong.",
      "A lot has happened between July 15 and May 30, but not much of it will be fondly remembered by United supporters. It has been a season to forget and everyone will be glad that it's now on the brink of its conclusion.",
      "This post-season tour is something everyone could have done without, particularly after what happened in the Europa League final. It's no wonder Hong Kong boss Ashley Westwood, who was at United as a youngster, said yesterday that United's players needed this tour \"like a hole in the head\".",
      "Delap has been the subject of interest from a cluster of Premier League clubs but has decided that a move to Stamford Bridge will be the best for him.",
      "In truth, it is not a massive 'blow' for United. Delap is 22 and has only been a regular starter in the Premier League for one season.",
      "His 12-goal haul for Ipswich Town this season was respectable, there is no doubt about that, but he is still raw and learning on the job. United need someone more established and proven at the highest level.",
      "After gambling on Rasmus Hojlund and Joshua Zirkzee in back-to-back summers, they could ill-afford to take another gamble on a young striker this time around.",
      "They need someone more established, who can come in and hit the ground running."

In an ideal world, Ruben Amorim would be chasing a reunion with Sporting Lisbon powerhouse Viktor Gyokeres, or joining the race for the talented Benjamin Sesko or the free agent Jonathan David. But all three will want Champions league football and United don't have it.",
      "Even the proven top flight alternatives to Delap, the likes of Brentford star Yoane Wissa and Crystal Palace striker Jean-Philippe Mateta could be financially out of reach for United with Premier League signings often attracting a premium.",
      "It means the Reds might have to cast the net further afield in their search for attacking options. And a look at the Bundesliga could provide an answer.",
      "A look down the list of top scorers, which is led by Harry Kane, sees the unheralded Jonathan Burkardt in fourth. The striker hit 18 goals last term to fire Mainz into Europe.",
      "At 24, he has more than 100 senior appearances for Mainz, who often deploy a 3-4-3 shape not dissimilar to Amorim's formation at United, under his belt and has broken into the Germany national side. Indeed, he is a candidate to be starting forward for his country when the 2026 World Cup rolls around next year.",
      "He's long been touted as a potential star in the making in his homeland and is now delivering on that promise.",
      "And the added bonus is he has a reported €20million release clause in his contract. He is attracting interest from Eintracht Frankfurt, who are pushing for a deal, and has only been tentatively linked with United.",
      "But as the Reds seek to strike a balance between the football and financial, Burkardt could be a viable option.",
      "United were woeful in front of in the 2024-25 campaign, but the addition of Cunha as a number 10 will likely improve that tally, while Burkardt is more of a line-leading presence than Hojlund.",
      "The German is far from the perfect solution, but if his price, pedigree and potential allow United to bolster their striker ranks and potentially add new signings elsewhere, he could be a shrewd summer investment."

      "Hello and welcome back to the Manchester United transfer blog on Friday, May 30.",
      "Yesterday was another tough one for United's recruitment department as one of their top targets decided to go elsewhere. Ipswich Town's Liam Delap has chosen to join Chelsea despite the Reds being able to activate his release clause of £30m.",
      "It is expected that the Blues will complete his deal this week and that means United need to turn their attention to alternatives. Napoli's Victor Osimhen is being heavily linked as an option for the Reds in lieu of Delap.",
      "There have been reports that recruitment director Matt Hargreaves is in Naples to try and thrash out a deal. Osimhen will likely want to get his business done sooner rather than later, considering how his exit last summer fell through on deadline day.",
      "Sporting's Viktor Gyokeres has also been linked to United thanks to his close relationship with Ruben Amorim. However, it appears the Reds are in a long queue for him which now looks to include Liverpool.",
      "Stay tuned to all the latest news from United's summer transfer window below...",
      "United's push to sign Gyokeres looks to be falling flatter by the day as new reports emerge from Portugal.",
      "According to Record, both Chelsea and Juventus have made approaches to Gyokeres this week in a bid to sign the Swede.",
      "Liverpool are also gaining popularity in the race to sign the striker and currently sit 11/2 with bet365 to get a deal over the line.",
      "According to Marca, United have a meeting booked in with Real Betis next week to discuss the future of Antony.",
      "It is claimed the two clubs are meeting to discuss 'different scenarios' however another loan spell in Seville has been ruled out by the Reds.",
      "Antony impressed at Real Betis since moving to the club in January and MEN Sport understands he is one of the players the club has earmarked to sell to raise funds for Amorim's rebuild.",
      "Amid all the talk of the United captain's future, there is a post-season friendly against Hong Kong to sink our teeth into.",
      "Fernandes will start for the Reds as will Garnacho who has been told he can leave the club this summer.",
      "United starting XI vs Hong Kong: Heaton; Fredricson, Evans, Kukonki; Kamason, Casemiro, Fernandes, Amass; Lacey, Garnacho; Hojlund.",
      "Substitutes: Bayindir, Armer, Heaven, Munro, Dorgu, Kone, Collyer, T. Fletcher, Mainoo, Moorhouse, Ugarte, Mount, Thwaites, Amad, Obi.",
      "You can follow the friendly HERE.",
      "Having drawn a blank in Malaysia against ASEAN All Stars, Hojlund was the subject of media questions to Amorim post-match.",
      "The United boss spoke coyly about the Dane and the need to add attacking reinforcements.",
      "Sometimes you cannot overthink the situations. Sometimes you go to holiday and then you arrive in the first day and you start a new season, even the environment in training ground can help all these players have more confidence. If you look at the data we improved in the last games. We have a lack of goals we will try to assess that and be prepared.",
      "According to Football Insider, Newcastle are leading United in the race to sign Brentford's Bryan Mbeumo this summer.",
      "The versatile attacking midfielder is thought to be available for £50m this summer.",
      "While United are keen on his signature, it is believed Newcastle with the pull of being in the Champions League next season are leading the way.",
      "Despite this update surrounding Fernandes' agent meeting Al Hilal, it is still clear that Amorim wants his captain to stay at the club and he is not looking to force him out.",
      "Speaking recently, Amorim explained:",
      "You can see by the performance, you can see by the leadership, the passion that he has for the game, so he’s really important. You could see that in the last game [Sunday’s 2-0 win against Aston Villa]. I felt that the team was without pressure and they performed quite well, everybody wants the ball. But we had some difficult moments and in those difficult moments you can see that Bruno is the guy that takes that responsibility. He should be because he’s the captain, he’s experienced, so he’s really important for us, and really important for what we want to build with this team.",
      "According to The Athletic, who have matched the information we have received, there is a feeling internally that Al Hilal's interest in Fernandes could have a knock on affect.",
      "It is believed that United sense that if they entertain a bid from the Saudi Pro League club, European teams will also enter the race for their captain.",
      "They claim that Fernandes would be earning, wages alone, £84m over the entirety of a four-year contract in Saudi Arabia.",
      "The stance in the United camp surrounding Fernandes is thought to be 'relaxed'.",
      "The club are refusing to rule out selling Fernandes this summer, with offers open for all United players.",
      "Despite uncertainty surrounding his future, Fernandes has remained professional while on the post-season tour in Asia.",
      "MEN Sport understands that United's captain is seriously considering leaving the club to join Al Hilal this summer.",
      "Fernandes's agent, Miguel Pinho, has held discussions with Al Hilal about a mooted £100m transfer and United have refused to rule out his possible sale.",
      "Al Hilal are eager to conclude a deal quickly so Fernandes, 30, can play for them in the Club World Cup in the United States next month.",
      "MORE HERE.",
      "According to journalist Ben Jacobs, Fernandes' agent Miguel Pinho travelled to Saudi Arabia this week to discuss terms with Al Hilal.",
      "The meeting is said to have taken place at the Four Seasons in Riyadh and were described as 'productive'.",
      "Al Hilal insist that Fernandes has yet to reject their offer and they are pushing hard for him to agree terms.",
      "United meanwhile are insistent that Fernandes is not for sale.",
      "According to reports from Italian media outlet Il Napolista, United are negotiating a deal in Naples for Victor Osimhen.",
      "Having enjoyed the title celebrations in Istanbul, Osimhen is expected back in Italy soon to sort his future.",
      "It is claimed that recruitment chief Matt Hargreaves is meeting with Napoli to try and reach an agreement.",

      "My name is Jack Flintham and I shall be taking you through the latest United news this morning and through to lunchtime.",
      "We are going to start by looking at United's Plan B now Delap has decided to join Chelsea.",
      "After a disappointing 2024/25 campaign, Manchester United will have been hoping their transfer strategy to help move past this was watertight.",
      "So with United being dealt a considerable blow in landing one of their top two targets, MEN Sport writers have their say here on how United can move past Delap and find another suitable target.",
      "Everyone connected with Manchester United knows they must sign a striker this summer.",
      "It's why there may be some disconnect that the Reds have missed out on what looked to be a relatively simple deal to sign Ipswich Town's Liam Delap. Here is a player with Premier League experience who is available for £30million after the Tractor Boys' relegation to English football's second tier.",
      "But would a young striker like Delap be able to cope with the pressure of leading the line for Ruben Amorim's side? It's a responsibility that has weighed heavily on the shoulders of Rasmus Hojlund since arriving from Atalanta. Moving from Ipswich to Old Trafford would be a huge step up.",
      "Read the full piece here",
      "Manchester United have been handed an update on Kobbie Mainoo amid transfer speculation surrounding the midfielder.",
      "Reports in March from The Guardianclaimed that Mainoo is minded to reject the offer of a new contract at ­Old Trafford and seek a move abroad. With just two years left on his current deal, United might eventually have to sell. The Reds' PSR position will likely force their hand.",
      "It is claimed that United value Mainoo at around £70million, but the question is whether any foreign club would be able to afford that fee. Only Premier League clubs tend to pay that price, unless you are Real Madrid, who may be too big of a step up for the Englishman right now.",
      "Read more here",
      "Manchester United forward Jadon Sancho has sent a message on social media as his loan spell with Chelsea nears an end.",
      "Sancho relocated to west London on a season-long loan last summer, with the winger looking for a new lease of life after struggling at United since signing from Borussia Dortmund in 2021. Due to the Blues' Premier League position being higher than 14th, Chelsea are now obliged to purchase the forward for £25million.",
      "However, it is believed that there is a £5m break clause that can be paid to withdraw from the deal, which would result in Sancho returning to Old Trafford. If this occurs, it is understood that he will not be reintegrated back into the United squad.",
      "Read more here",
      "Man United and Man City are showing interest in Benfica goalkeeper Anatoliy Trubin, according to the Mirror US.",
      "The Portuguese side are willing to sell the Ukraine international for around £29.7m with the goalkeeper open to a move to the Premier League.",
      "The report adds that United would have made a move if they won the Europa League.",
      "In the last hour and a half we brought you reports that United are in Naples trying to organise a deal for Osimhen.",
      "From Napoli's perspective, while they are tough negotiators, they are also in a position where they need to sell Osimhen sooner rather than later.",
      "The Serie A champions have already started spending their money that they are looking to receive for the striker.",
      "Kevin De Bruyne, Jonathan David and Edon Zhegrova are all players that Napoli are reportedly working to sign.",
      "But, they are doing so hoping that Osimhen leaves so the sooner a deal is done the better and this could play into United's hands perfectly.",
      "According to The Athletic's David Ornstein, an agreement between Chelsea and Ipswich Town has been agreed for Delap.",
      "The Blues have activated Delap's £30m release clause ahead of his purchase.",
      "It is reported that personal terms still need to be agreed but no issue is expected there.",
      "For United, the Conference League final could not have gone much better.",
      "Before the game, Antony had already proven his worth ahead of the summer but there was still question marks about Sancho.",
      "Therefore, it did not matter that Antony had a quiet game, that will not affect the chances of him finding a new permanent home.",
      "Sancho needed to perform especially if, as is predicted, Chelsea will not pay £25m for him.",
      "He put himself in the shop window in the Conference League final and United will hope that this cameo will earn them a transfer fee if Chelsea pull out.",
      "In another blow for United, handed to them by Chelsea, it appears the Blues are leaning away from the idea of signing Sancho for £25m.",
      "According to The Guardian, as per their report on Delap choosing Chelsea over United, they believe that the Conference League holders are leaning towards not paying £25m for Sancho.",
      "While Enzo Maresca is thought to be a fan of the winger, he is believed to be unsure whether the forward is consistent enough.",
      "United now know that one of their main targets for this summer is destined to move to Chelsea.",
      "Fabrizio Romano understands that Chelsea's Champions League football next season was a contributing factor towards Delap wanting a move to Stamford Bridge.",
      "Our colleagues at football.london add that their current co-director of recruitment Joe Shields is a big fan of Delap having been at Manchester City when the forward signed from Derby County.",
      "According to Il Napolista, United are turning their attention to Napoli striker Victor Osimhen after missing out on Delap.",
      "It is claimed that recruitment chief Matt Hargreaves has flown to Naples to try and thrash out a deal for Osimhen.",
      "Napoli want to sell the talisman who scored 36 goals for Galatasaray on loan this season but will want Rasmus Hojlund in return, plus £33.5m.",
      "United were believed to have £30m saved up to activate Delap's release clause so it is not too much more that Ineos would need to stump up to bring the Nigerian to the Premier League.",
      "Hello and welcome back to the United transfer blog on Thursday afternoon.",
      "My name is Jack Flintham and I shall be taking you through the next couple of hours keeping you across all the latest news surrounding United.",
      "If you are just joining us today, here's a catch up on what you have missed:",
      "To kick us off here, there could be a Plan B starting to form as an alternative to Delap...",
      "Man United CEO Omar Berrada has discussed the club's transfer plans for the first time since the season finish.",
      "Speaking in Malaysia, he said:",
      "I can't talk about specifics, but I can say we've been planning for many months now.",
      "We were ready for all the different scenarios. Now we know what we need to do. We have a very clear idea of where we need to invest in the squad to improve.",
      "So Jason [Wilcox], his team and Ruben have been in talks for many months. And now it's a question of executing that plan and doing it in a way that is prudent. But at the same time, with ambition.",
      "Saudi Pro League side Neom SC want to sign Andre Onana this summer, according to the Mirror.",

      "Marcus Rashford is reportedly holding out for a move to Barcelona and is saying no to other moves, according to SPORT in Spain.",

      "However, the Spanish giants are only keen on a loan with an option to buy this summer.",
      "AC Milan are set to open negotiations for Alejandro Garnacho after he was made available for transfer this summer.",
      "Argentine outlet Ole have claimed that Milan have silently begun negotiations for the forward. The report also adds that Napoli, Juventus and Chelsea are all considering offers.",

      "Selling Fernandes now, against Amorim's wishes, could not only damage United's squad but also ruin the trust built between the manager and the boardroom. Once lost, that is difficult to regain."

      "However this week, United were informed that Delap wanted to move to Chelsea and just like that, the Reds are scrambling for an alternative. One of the more popular options to bolster the United attack is Victor Osimhen.",

      "While he was referring to Gyokeres at the time, that sentiment relates to Osimhen as well. Amorim needs to be sure that the forward is signing for the right reasons and if he feels that the striker only wants to join because Champions League football in the future is a possibility, he won't be signed.",
      "The ball is therefore in Osimhen's court. It is up to him whether he would want to sign for United for the right reasons and not just to get out of Napoli and further increase his personal net worth."

      "Concerns over Alejandro Garnacho's attitude may mean he's bound to leave Manchester United this summer. And one former Carrington coach provided early warning signs about the South American's supposed character flaws.",
      "There’s growing speculation manager Ruben Amorim is prepared to offload Garnacho after the player was left out of United's last match of the season against Aston Villa. The Argentina international was previously dropped from the XI for the Europa League final defeat to Tottenham, after which Garnacho publicly expressed his frustration at a \"s***\" season.",
      "Justin Cochrane previously helped lead United's academy when Garnacho starred in the under-18s' FA Youth Cup victory in 2022. The then-17-year-old winger crowned that campaign by winning the Jimmy Murphy Young Player of the Year award, identifying himself as a future first-team talent.",
      "Cochrane, now a first-team coach at Brentford, noted the player's exceptional talent but also alluded to a mismatch between his conduct and prowess on the pitch. And while he refrained from being overly critical of the young talent, there were hints of possible issues with his behaviour.",
      "Talking to Goal in March 2022 about his efforts to keep Garnacho's ego in check, Cochrane said: \"I have a good relationship with Garnacho, and he knows that if he crosses the line, I'll come get him!\"",
      "The former QPR and Rotherham defender followed up by saying he and his staff were \"pleased\" with the player. However, the conversation again shifted to prioritising modesty, something that might not have come unless there were existing concerns.",
      "\"My job and the staff's job is to keep players grounded and keep their eyes on the prize,\" Cochrane added. \"Not just the youth prize, but the bigger prize of being in the first team and having a sustained career at a high level, so that's what we're focusing on with Garna.\"",
      "Amorim isn't the first United manager to have issues with Garnacho's behaviour. The Madrid-born star was previously chastised by Erik ten Hag after he 'liked' social media posts criticising his half-time substitution in a 2-2 draw against Bournemouth in April 2024.",
      "Ten Hag later revealed his player had apologised for the incident, suggesting they had put the matter behind them. However, Garnacho was subsequently dropped by the Dutchman in September 2024, shortly before he was sacked, for once again liking posts critical of the coach.",
      "Cochrane's comments from 2022 suggest a recurring pattern of behaviour that most coaches would prefer to avoid. And it seems Amorim has reached his limit, with the player apparently free to leave if an appropriate offer is made.",
      "Napoli have shown significant interest in the player during recent transfer windows. However, this potential move may be at risk due to reports suggesting Antonio Conte is ready to depart the club after just one season, having clinched the Serie A title.",
      "This could leave United in a rush to find a club willing to match their valuation for the player. But there's no confusion, it seems, that Amorim is ready to part ways should any outfit stump up the cash, with United supposedly wanting upwards of £60million."

      "Amorim was in an invidious position. He would have dreaded hoisting a trophy barely befitting a Sunday League final yet United were beaten in a country they last visited for Michael Owen’s first appearance in July 2009.",
      "Friendlies can be an effective cure for insomniacs and this had all the hallmarks of unwatchable exhibition matches: A lack of goals, 27 players used by United alone, a light show and a Mexican Wave midway through the second half. Soccer Aid might be more competitive and dynamic.",
      "United first visited Malaysia 30 years ago and United at their very worst since relegation still drew a crowd: 72,550 was the official attendance in the Bukit Jalil National Stadium.",
      "True to form, United did not provide the game’s only goal as they went 1-0 down for the umpteenth time in the past 12 months. In the 84th minute, there was the familiar scenario of a United winger crossing into the penalty area only for the striker to be nowhere in sight.",
      "Five minutes later, Alejandro Garnacho abandoned selflessness but his shot was wayward. Bruno Fernandes looked at the heavens and his shoulders slumped. A familiar feeling. United got so desperate that Tom Heaton went up for an added-time corner.",

      "6,606 miles is an exceedingly long way to travel for a match you will learn nothing from. United have not pretended that the football is the priority on this commercial trip that will rake in £8million and the only positive was that some of their callow academy members were granted minutes.",
      "Garnacho briefly vanished down the tunnel during the first half, possibly to maximise the air conditioning. He was selected for the start of the second half and was cheered when he headed over to the far side. They were louder when Garnacho got the ball. Time will tell if it was the last time in the red of United.",
      "Eleven minutes into the second half, Garnacho was on his haunches, briefly overwhelmed by the humidity. The players had to peel their shirts off as though they had been stuck on.",
      "Andre Onana had his name aired for the first time in United colours. Harry Maguire was booed by casual spectators in Melbourne, Las Vegas and Dublin but here in Kuala Lumpur was cheered louder than ever whenever he received the ball.",
      "This was the first occasion that Maguire had captained United from the start since he was stripped of the captaincy in July 2023, extra validation for a player who had his contract extended earlier in the year.",
      "Fernandes inevitably generated the loudest chant upon his half-time arrival. Even Fernandes’ rabona - when a player wraps one leg around the other and pokes the ball forward - that went out for a goal kick drew widespread ‘ooh’s.",
      "The chanting briefly switched to \"Bruno stay, Bruno stay\". Fernandes could have clarified his future by now and has not done so. United have another press conference in Hong Kong on Thursday evening.",
      "The United fans were not entirely enthusiastic. An errant pass from Toby Collyer elicited jeers, with fans willing United to at least score.",
      "You work up a sweat just by sitting down in this part of the world. Fans were handed out to fans, it was that sweltering. Omar Berrada remained statesman-like, arriving in a club suit when he could have been forgiven for donning casual attire. Jason Wilcox is not in Asia ahead of the defining summer of his administrative career.",
      "When United were last in Asia in Bangkok three years ago, Jurgen Klopp played three different Liverpool outfield XIs against them. By the 20-minute mark at the Bukit Jalil, Shea Lacey, Jaydan Kamason, Dan Armer and Sekou Kone were already limbering up with the fitness coach Paulo Barreira.",
      "The quartet came on ten minutes later during a drinks break. Jack Moorhouse's maiden first-team exposure lasted 30 minutes. Casemiro, whose 19-month exile from the Brazil national squad ended with Carlos Ancelotti's appointment, gratefully traipsed off.",
      "Amorim was more drastic than Klopp. There were 11 changes at half-time, so Lacey, Kone, Armer and Kamason were not even afforded a quarter of the match. All but one of the second-half XI played 45 minutes.",
      "United used 27 players, overall. Altay Bayindir was the only unused matchday squad member, with Matthijs de Ligt, Joshua Zirkzee, Luke Shaw and Mason Mount all clad in leisure gear. United have another game in less than 48 hours, a four-hour flight away, in Hong Kong.",

      "A former Manchester United star has revealed his main ‘fear’ with Ruben Amorim as the ‘jury is out’ on the under-fire Red Devils head coach.",
      "Amorim has had a torrid time since replacing former Man Utd boss Erik ten Hag towards the end of last year, losing 16 of his 42 games in all competitions.",
      "The 40-year-old has struggled to implement his preferred 3-4-3 system in the middle of a season, with his Man Utd squad unsuited to his chosen 3-4-3 formation.",
      "Man Utd’s performances under Amorim have been worse than under Ten Hag at the start of this season, with the England giants finishing 15th in the Premier League.",
      "The Red Devils had the opportunity to salvage something from this season as they faced Spurs in the Europa League final, with a trophy, huge prize money and Champions League qualification up for grabs.",
      "But Man Utd did not turn up as they were deservedly beaten and Amorim is currently among the facourites to be the next Premier League manager sacked.",
      "Former Man Utd midfielder Paul Ince reckons the “jury has to be out” on Amorim as he revealed his main “fear” with the head coach.",
      "“It’s been disappointing and you can’t get away from that,” Ince told The Metro.",
      "READ: Man Utd ‘FIRE SALE’ and Liverpool £315m fund-raise in transfer nonsense",
      "“But the position that they’re in six months into Ruben Amorim is food for thought and concern. I know he hasn’t got the personnel that he wants in the team but also, I’ve not been convinced about the style and formation that he’s playing.",
      "“It’s still Ten Hag’s team which was built for a different style, so now you’re seeing what happens when you play people out of position or in a system that many of them aren’t comfortable.",
      "“But my fear is whether he can make that formation work in any case. United have never played three at the back in their history, and apart from Inter, all the best teams in the world play with that back four.",
      "“With a lot of that current squad, we’re not talking about bad players. Some of these players earn a lot of money, and regardless of the formation, they have to be playing at a level higher than they are right now. To be fifth from the bottom is absolutely disastrous.",
      "“They put all their eggs in one basket in terms of winning the Europa League and that performance was absolutely pathetic. Fans can understand performances dropping in the weeks before the final, but you have to show up, and they were diabolical. So the jury still has to be out.”",
      "Ince has also hit out at Man Utd’s board as they should have been in the ‘race” to sign two Liverpool stars.",
      "“There’s plenty of work to be done from Amorim but also from those above because the recruitment has been really poor,” Ince added.",
      "“Even if you look at that final, Luke Shaw has barely been fit all season and he has to fill in at centre back, you have a player like Ugarte who you spent £50m on and he doesn’t even start in the final.",
      "“What has happened to Mainoo? A guy who was a world-beater last year and in the England side and now can’t get a game. So these are the questions that need to be asked over the next three or four months.",

      "“Ruben Amorim needs someone to play behind the centre forward, Man Utd have no player who runs beyond and that’s one of the things that might have helped Hojlund if he had someone who’d run to create more space for him.",

If the players haven’t got it, in their heart and in their heads, you can’t change that. If you look at last season, Man Utd shouldn’t be anywhere near that level again in my lifetime.”",

      "Liam Delap choosing Chelsea is a massive blow for Manchester United – much more damaging than it would have been for the Blues had the 22-year-old snubbed them in favour of the Red Devils.",
      "Chelsea are an attractive club to play for right now; Manchester United are not. It’s not Delap or bust for Chelsea, but that feels very much the case for United.",
      "Delap was perfect: young; cheap; scores Premier League goals. And crucially, while United are terrible, they are definitely better than Ipswich.",
      "Not only do they not have European football as a draw, there’s also no light at the end of a tunnel which has grown longer under Ruben Amorim thanks to a philosophy and system almost laughably unsuited to the players in his squad. Any striker joining United this summer will wonder how long a contract might need to be for them to see a semblance of success at Old Trafford.",
      "History, a fading assumption that things must get better at Manchester United because This Is Manchester United and a promise of game time are about the only selling points Amorim and his recruitment team can use to lure players to the club this summer.",
      "That won’t be enough for Viktor Gyokeres, Benjamin Sesko, Hugo Ekitike or other top-level goalscorers United would previously have been vying to sign, and our struggle to come up with these seven striker options – most of whom still feel like unlikely additions for various reasons – shows just how bleak things are for Amorim in the search for anyone who can put the ball in the back of the net.",
      "",
      "Victor Osimhen (Napoli)\nNaming United’s director of negotiations Matt Hargreaves along with Napoli owner Aurelio De Laurentiis and sporting director Giovanni Manna in a report claiming a meeting has been held in Naples to discuss a swap deal for Osimhen adds a level of credence to a rumour we would otherwise have dismissed out of hand. Kudos to the reporter for their commitment to the clicks if it is indeed nonsense.",
      "Osimhen is a world-class striker who’s scored 36 goals on loan at Galatasaray this term and 100 goals in his last four seasons. He’s in that top rung of goalscorers currently available for transfer. And weirdly, despite being very available – Napoli are desperate to get rid of him with his contract expiring at the end of next season – there appears to be scant competition to sign him.",
      "Arsenal and Liverpool have turned their noses up for some reason, Paris Saint-Germain are no longer keen and even Chelsea appear to have gone off the idea of signing a brilliant 26-year-old striker for £65m on £200,000-per-week wages. Sounds good to us.",
      "And amid reports that, unlike other top strikers, Osimhen isn’t all that bothered about Champions League football, we wonder if the Nigerian doesn’t have something of a chip on his shoulder…a burning desire to prove doubters wrong.",
      "He can find a kindred spirit in that pursuit at Old Trafford in Amorim, and we’re sure (actually we’re not, but we hope) Osimhen would rather be scoring Premier League goals, even for Manchester United, than Saudi Pro League goals for whichever PIF club offers him a billion pounds a year to play in front of tens of people.",
      "",
      "Jean-Philippe Mateta (Crystal Palace)\nWe love him and really don’t want him, Eberechi Eze, Adam Wharton or anyone else to leave Palace ahead of their Europa League campaign as Oliver Glasner – having already won it once before with Frankfurt – could do something really rather special with this group if he can keep them together.",
      "Reports suggesting Mateta is open to a move as he looks to catch Didier Deschamps’ eye ahead of the World Cup in 2026 begs the question as to whether he’s more likely to do that by staying at Palace and playing in Europe or through moving to Old Trafford. We’re leaning towards the latter as for better or worse, Deschamps – like everyone else – will be very aware of what Mateta is doing if he becomes United’s new No.9.",
      "He could be great as well. He’s what Rasmus Hojlund should be – a bully who holds the ball up well with a decent touch, brings playmakers into the game, runs in behind and gets on the end of crosses. Another significant boon for Amorim is that Mateta has thrived for Palace in the 3-4-3 formation he is trying to make work at Old Trafford.",
      "",
      "Ollie Watkins (Aston Villa)\nAnyone not watching Villa week in, week out, and actually a fair few who have, would claim this was something of a fallow season for Watkins. A fair point compared to last term perhaps, but a Premier League return of 16 goals and eight assists meant only four players – Mohamed Salah (47), Alexander Isak (29), Bryan Mbeumo (27) and Erling Haaland (25) – finished the campaign with more goal contributions than the 29-year-old, in what was his second-best top-flight season in that regard.",
      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe and his INEOS team made a point of not wanting to sign players over the age of 25 when they took charge of football operations, in a bid to ensure their market values at least had a chance of increasing in their time at the club, rather than fading to nothing as has been the case for pretty much everyone signed in the last decade.",
      "The England international would have to hit the ground running and score goals at a fair lick to avoid his value dropping as he turns 30 in December, but needs must and United just need to find someone, anyone who can lead the line – as Watkins has done very, very well for Villa under Unai Emery – and score goals.",
      "",
      "Patrik Schick (Bayer Leverkusen)\nHis age (29) is about the only stick you can beat Schick with given his schtick this season has been scoring more Bundesliga goals (21) than anyone but Serhou Guirassy (also 21) and Harry Kane (26).",
      "Reports suggest Bayer Leverkusen would be open to bids of around £30m for a striker who could probably be tempted by a move to any Premier League team – with or without European football – such is his long-held desire to play in the English top flight.",
      "Meanwhile, Hugo Ekitike and Benjamin Sesko, who have been linked with the top-tier clubs looking for strikers this summer, have both had £80m-£100m price tags slapped on them despite scoring 15 and 13 Bundesliga goals respectively.",
      "Schick would be a relatively low risk, cheap option for United.",
      "",
      "Christopher Nkunku (Chelsea)\nTalking of risk, Nkunku might just be the most perilous option. He’s done nothing at Chelsea to suggest he’s got what it takes to be a Premier League footballer. He’s done plenty to suggest he’s not cut out for it. And yet… he is a very talented footballer – ‘there’s a player in there’ as they say.",
      "But while that player could perhaps be uncovered at Liverpool or another stable football club, Manchester United are not in a position to be lifting a footballer from a slump, while a move to Old Trafford will almost certainly see Nkunku scrabbling on his hands and knees at the cloying soil at the base of the hole he finds himself to find the rocks at the very bottom.",
      "",
      "Moise Kean (Fiorentina)\nHis signing is unlikely to be widely heralded by the United fanbase on the basis of a Premier League career which saw him score just four goals in 39 appearances for Everton having been seen as quite the transfer coup when Marco Silva persuaded him to join from Juventus in 2019. He was only a kid at the time though and has developed his game in the meantime to become a far more rounded striker.",
      "Kean scored 19 Serie A goals this season, behind on Mateo Retegui (25), including braces against Roma and Inter, and goals against Juventus, Atalanta and AC Milan.",
      "He has a €52m [£44m] release clause, which feels reasonable, and may well feel as though he has unfinished business in the Premier League.",
      "",
      "We won’t profess to have seen Burkardt in action enough to make a claim over his suitability to United in terms of style, but everything about a move for him feels pretty perfect besides an eye test which we’re 100% sure would lead us to insist he’s a better bet than Hojlund.",
      "He’s 24, a Germany international, has frequently played in a 3-4-3 and has a release clause of just €20m [£17m]. The not insignificant issue for United is that Frankfurt have supposedly made Burkardt their top target if Ekitike gets poached by one of the big boys, and they can offer him Champions League football. But United should absolutely be looking into this one at the very least.",
      "Man Utd director of negotiations Matt Hargreaves has flown to Italy for a ‘meeting’ with Napoli owner De Laurentiis over a potential swap deal this summer.",
      "According to reports, Manchester United have ‘chosen’ their preferred striker signing after losing the Europa League final to Tottenham Hotspur.",
      "From the Premier League’s finest chaos merchant to the Gunners’ top transfer target, these are the 10 best strikers available this summer…",
      "12 of the top 100 most valuable footballers are almost certain to leave their current clubs this summer and we’ve predicted where they’ll end up.",
      "Wayne Rooney reckons Man Utd should look to sign two of Chelsea’s top targets this summer as they close in on their first deal.",
      "According to reports, Manchester United have four strikers on their ‘shortlist’, with a former Premier League flop in a ‘renaissance’ among their options."

      "Man Utd captain Bruno Fernandes could now ‘quit’ the Red Devils as his potential future takes yet another U-turn, according to reports.",
      "The Red Devils have had a terrible season in the Premier League with Ruben Amorim’s side finishing the campaign in 15th position after a final day win over Aston Villa.",
      "Amorim has failed to improve performances or results since taking over from Erik ten Hag in November and now there are set to be big changes in the summer.",
      "Man Utd had a huge chance to put this season behind them when they faced Tottenham in the Europa League final earlier this month – but Spurs triumphed as Ange Postecoglou’s side booked their place in the Champions League for next season.",
      "The money would have been very welcome at Old Trafford with rumours that Man Utd could have to sell a number of their better players in order to facilitate the transfer window they want.",
      "Fernandes is one of the only players that a majority of supporters would want the club to keep in the summer transfer window but the riches on offer from Saudi Arabia could be too much.",
      "READ: Man Utd ‘at bottom of a six foot hole’ but Bruno still surely unsellable",
      "Speaking on his future after losing the Europa League final, Fernandes said: “I have always been honest. I’ve always said I will be here until the club says to me that it’s time to go.",
      "“I’m eager to do more, to be able to bring the club the great days. In the day that the club thinks that I’m too much or it’s time to part ways, football is like this, you never know it. But I’ve always said it and I keep my word in the same way.",
      "“If the club thinks it’s time to part ways because they want to do some cashing in or whatever, it’s what it is, and football sometimes is like this.”",
      "Rumours of an exit to Saudi Pro League side Al-Hilal have continued in recent days with a claim on Thursday that they will make a £100m bid if Fernandes accepts their offer to effectively quadruple his wages.",
      "And, in a fresh report, The Times have claimed that Fernandes ‘may quit’ after ‘positive talks’ with the Saudi Arabia side this week.",
      "The Portugal international is now ‘giving serious thought to quitting’ Man Utd after ‘his agent held positive talks with Al-Hilal over a deal that could end up earning him around £700,000 per week’.",
      "Fernandes ‘has been mulling over a proposal from the Saudi Pro League club this week’ and Al-Hilal ‘want Fernandes to decide his future over the weekend as they would like the Portuguese to play for them in the Club World Cup, which begins on June 14’.",
      "Former Chelsea and Aston Villa forward Tony Cascarino reckons Man Utd should take £100m if Al-Hilal are willing to pay that for 30-year-old Fernandes.",
      "Cascarino told talkSPORT earlier this week: “I would snap their hand off. It’s time for a number of big decisions to be made and he’s one of them. If they’re getting offered £100m for a 30-year-old, you take it. You absolutely take it.",
      "“It’s money that you’ve got to use very wisely on people that you’ve identified to bring in. I’d take it immediately.",
      "“If that was the offer, I think Man United would even have to push him a bit [towards the move] and say ‘we’re looking in a different direction now’.”",
      "Manchester United are in something of a mess and it could end in bankruptcy. But should they sell Bruno Fernandes?",
      "According to reports, there has been an ‘intriguing twist’ in the race to sign Manchester United captain Bruno Fernandes, with Al-Hilal ‘ready to pay’.",
      "Manchester United have been treading on rakes in the transfer market for a decade now; selling Bruno Fernandes would be the most catastrophic mis-step yet.",
      "Man Utd captain Bruno Fernandes has been given a deadline by Saudi Arabian side Al-Hilal after making him a ‘final contract offer’, according to reports.",
      "Man Utd have been told that they should “push” Bruno Fernandes “out” of the club if they receive a £100m “offer” from Saudi Arabia.",
      "Jamie Redknapp has picked out a “game-changer” in Manchester United’s squad for INEOS to sell this summer amid interest from elsewhere."

      "Man Utd’s damaging defeat to Tottenham also leaves the club with a restricted budget ahead of the summer transfer window, with it suggested that they need to sell to buy.",

      "‘Delap’s snub is a big blow to United, who currently have limited funds with which they can work. They must now accelerate plans to sell several high-profile names to begin their own spending.",
      "‘United’s other striker targets include Viktor Gyokeres and Benjamin Sesko, who are also top targets for Arsenal. Either will also take some convincing that moving to a club with no European football to offer is the way forward.’",

      "Man Utd between rock and hard place\nSpurs are viewed, by everyone outside of the club, as a team whose club motto should be ‘flatter to deceive’",
      "A team which is financially potent (most profitable team in the Premier League) plays good football most of the time but has a long and storied history of snatching defeat from the jaws of victory.",
      "They sign players who are either young up and comers whose career will be derailed at Spurs mostly or old players looking for that final low pressure well paid job.",
      "Everything I’ve just said describes Man United. They can now add ‘slips on obvious banana skins’ to their rap sheet after losing to Spurs in the final….who loses to Spurs?",
      "I dunno if anyone ever reads published accounts but according to accounts Man United would not have “gone bankrupt” in December if earthworm Jim hadn’t saved them. They’d have been restricted as to their options but that’s simply not true.",
      "However, the lack of European football next year means United are at the bottom of a six foot hole waiting for the dirt to be piled on. Two seasons out of European football and we might actually see United go bankrupt. Summer will be a rough time, gamble and let Amorim spend in the hope they’ll make the Champions League and keep the wolves at bay but also ensure the death of the club if they don’t.",
      "Or",
      "Do everything cheap. Essentially become Roy Hodgson and Hicks and Gillette’s Liverpool. Pick up players like Konchesky for £2m and Andriy Voronin for free and likely stay out of administration but set the club on a 5-10 year path of mediocrity?\nLee",

      "",
      "You can’t sell Bruno even if it makes sense\nI’m going to start this email by saying that I don’t think United should sell Bruno, nor do I want him to leave. But there is an argument to be made that his sale might not be the worst thing ever.",
      "United are about to sign Cunha. He has 15 goals and six assists last season v Bruno’s 8 goals and 11 assists. Cunha played 3 fewer games. So Cunha could replace Bruno’s attacking output, at least in terms of goal involvements, if not in terms of creating chances for our non-existent strikers.",
      "There is also an argument that United would be better without Bruno because he gives the ball away so much. This could be said to have cost us in the Europa League final in which he was otherwise anonymous (despite getting a Whoscored rating of 7.39). I always think he’s United’s Steven Gerrard but is he in fact our Coutinho?",
      "Selling Bruno would provide significant funds – not selling for less than £100M, which would be almost pure profit – which we could invest wisely in 2/3 young players for big needs within the squad.",
      "Now, having said all that with a straight face, United should not entertain Bruno’s sale this summer (unless silly money is offered – £150M plus) for three reasons:",
      "1) Hes our best player and one of only four players in their prime we can rely (possibly five with Cunha coming in)",
      "2) There’s no guarantee anyone will replace his contribution – even Cunha is outscoring his xG massively already so a regression to the mean will mean a drop in his output.",
      "3) I don’t trust United to replace him",
      "Bruno plus Cunha means United score more goals next year, even without a striker. No Bruno leaves us where we are with no guarantee that anyone in the team is going to replace his output. We wouldn’t even be able to spend the money on the quality of player that could guarantee replacing his output because they all want to play in the Champions League and not for a team that trades on its history rather than the quality on the pitch.",

      "They can’t go to North America yet because of the World Club thing (but will once that’s ended), they certainly can’t do Europe (but Sweden is okay because it’s Sweden) as that’s rubbing salt into the wounds, and they can’t do the Middle East because that would result in media questions about that Sheikh fella just as they complain about having no money.",
      "That leaves S. America, which was never going to be likely, Africa (no money in it), and the Far East, which is where they are. The club needs all the income it can get, and also playing at home in August will help with this.",
      "As an aside, I now live in the Far East and the people are pissed. A chance to see their team and that’s what gets served up. It won’t mean anything to the club, but fans (those who did attend – it was half full in KL) have saved up for this for months, so you can imagine that being beaten by a team that technically does not exist is far from amusing for them.",

      "Something about Scouse Galacticos\nI am surprised that Ed Ern’s contribution to Wednesday’s Mailbox did not receive any rebukes on Thursday. Not to be snide but I think this may be because it was extremely long and I’m not sure rival fans bothered reading it all the way through. I’m a Liverpool fan but even I found parts of it to be utterly preposterous, though.",
      "To his great credit, Ed rightly acknowledges the great job FSG has done in running the club, and admits he had been wrong about them previously, specifically about “completely throwing all the good work away with pointless penny pinching” in 2019-2021 when LFC was on top.",
      "To his great discredit, Ed has decided to somehow repeat this mistake like-for-like, and is now trying to convince himself that this moment is “a near unique opportunity” to “start a dynasty” and “rival even the Real Madrids of this world”. It’s a baffling lack of perspective/awareness from someone who began by acknowledging a previous lack of perspective/awareness.",
      "FSG have owned and operated the club for 15 years now. They have an established track record of making excellent, if financially conservative, decisions. They have stated repeatedly from the beginning in 2010 that they would operate the club within its own means, and that they would always reinvest any money generated by the club into itself. They have lived up to this promise and delivered more than I had ever dared hope Liverpool would achieve in a football landscape competing with the likes of City/Chelsea/PSG/Newcastle/Chinese-clubs-10-years-ago/Saudi-clubs-2-years-ago. They brought in Suarez, they brought in Allison and Virgil, they offered 120m for Felipe Caicedo, they are working on major deals this summer.",
      "FSG does not reinvest the club’s money into itself each and every year, though; the money is sometimes rolled over to future windows, and this upsets a lot of fans. These fans have either missed the fact that LFC has won two league titles in 35 years and both came in seasons when the club did basically nothing in the transfer window, or they simply care more about transfers than they do about effective football club management, who knows.",
      "It was always a mistake to interpret FSG’s general fiscal conservatism as a lack of ambition from club management/ownership, or as a sign of greed/them taking money out of the club. But it is also a mistake to interpret FSG loosening the purse strings for opportunistic luxury purchases like Suarez/Allison/Caicedo/Wirtz as the start of an era of Scouse Galacticos, rather than exceptions to the rule/approach which has served LFC so well over the last 15 years and will hopefully continue to see us with a club that we can be wholly proud to support.\nOliver (sidenote: if City’s FFP/PSR charges are confirmed, we could have already been talking about an FSG-led LFC dynasty in English football) Dziggel, Geneva Switzerland",
      "",
      "Why the fuss over Chelsea?\nThere seems to be a big deal being made of the fact that Chelsea have become the first English club to win all 3 ‘major’ European trophies.",
      "The Europa Conference League final has only been played 4 times and I suspect that any ambitious team will still be aiming for the Champions League and would see even a drop into the Europa League as a failure, rather than aiming to match Chelsea’s majestic European treble.",
      "Chelsea were not in the Conference League because they qualified for the Europa League but Man Utd winning the FA Cup put them in there instead, but they did put themselves in a position to qualify for the Europa League and were then shifted to the Conference League due to Utd’s FA Cup win because ‘them’s the rules’.",
      "Having said all that, I would love Arsenal to win any European trophy as it might shut Stewie Griffin up (it wouldn’t) and although, unlike some ‘supporters, I don’t see winning trophies as the be all and end all (it is possible to just enjoy football for the game that it is) it is very enjoyable.",

      "Chelsea > Arsenal next season\nOk so May isn’t even out yet, but here’s a hot take for you:",
      "Chelsea to finish above Arsenal in the Premier League next season.",
      "Woah there nelly, I hear you say. But hear me out.",
      "Firstly, let’s look at Arsenal. Three consecutive years (four, if you count the collapsed bid for Champions League football in 2022) of coming up short with largely the same group of players. This season has given us strong hints it is starting to take its toll.",
      "If they couldn’t deal with the pressure of the last few years, how is it going to be in this coming season – the 5th proper year of the Arteta project – where the expectations now shift from HOPING to EXPECTING to win a trophy? They’ll probably get that striker they need, but it won’t be the cure for all ills. They still lack squad depth. They still lack knowhow at the business end of the season. And Arteta doesn’t help with his paranoia and touchline histrionics.",
      "No, for me, this feels like a club coming to the end game of a project, not the start. Liverpool and Man City will definitely finish above them next year.",
      "And so, to Chelsea. Back in the Champions League, and with that winning feeling from bagging the Conference League. And now, this afternoon, news is coming through they’re grabbing Delap from under the noses of Manchester United (lol, by the way) which surely represents an upgrade on the erratic Jackson.",
      "If they can now get a decent goalkeeper and a dominant centre back to supplement the quality of James, Cucurella, Enzo, Caicedo, Lavia, Palmer and (presumably) Delap, then you’re looking at a side that can surely only be heading in one direction and that is upwards. It’s easy to scoff at Chelsea these last few years – and a lot of it has been entirely justified – but you just get a feeling that something might just be starting to take off at long last.",
      "Please feel free to chuck this back in my face if Arsenal are 10 points clear at Christmas and Chelsea are looking like they fancy a return to Conference League football – but I’m confident that you’ll see a changing of the guard in London next season.\nAndy H, Swansea",

      "The red line for fandom\nBadwolf wrote in yesterday about the red line for supporting a club. I’ll give you mine. I happened to grow up in Los Angeles, so have been a Los Angeles Dodgers fan ever since I knew baseball existed. That’s about 65 years worth of fandom. In recent seasons the Dodgers have been very very good, and last season (not counting the COVID season of 2020, run on very different lines), they won their first World Series in 36 years. I was thrilled. It felt great.",
      "Well, it’s an American tradition for champion sports teams to visit the White House for a ceremony with the President. Without the slightest peep of dissent, the Dodgers went to the White House and gave Donald Trump a personalized replica jersey.",
      "I no longer care whether they win or lose. I’ve switched my allegiance to the Chicago White Sox, a team that is unlikely to win a World Series in the rest of my lifetime, and right now is pretty bad. But I love the city of Chicago, I loved the old ballpark the Sox used to play in, and the team has spirit and heart. I’m a very happy baseball fan right now.\nPeter G, Pennsylvania, USA (it can be done)",

One of their regular features, AVQ&A, sees their writers respond to irreverent or reflective questions like “What’s your favourite piece of college-set pop culture?” or “What’s your most visceral experience in a movie theatre?” That sort of thing.",

Even the editorial team are human (probably), so let’s hear what they actually think – off the cuff, from the heart, without needing to provoke anyone into frothing rage in the comments section.",

      "Just as the five-time Ballon d’Or winner left Manchester United kicking and screaming amid their failure to qualify for the Champions League (and justified prolonged snub from Erik ten Hag), he is suffering from similar FOMO at Al Nassr, as they are not competing in this summer’s Club World Cup.",

      "3) CF Monterrey\nThe Mexican side are the first Club World Cup competitor to be mentioned here. This possible move would see him reunite with Mohamed Salah’s best friend, Sergio Ramos, while he’d also line up alongside ex-Sevilla star Lucas Ocampos.",

      "These are the 10 best wide forwards available in the 2025 summer transfer window. Arsenal, Liverpool, Newcastle and Chelsea should be taking notes…",
      "And here are the best available strikers.",
      "",
      "10) Jack Grealish (Manchester City)\nThere are younger options like Jamie Gittens, Antony, Kenan Yildiz, Johan Bakayoko and Tyler Dibling (that’s the honourable mentions out of the way), but we reckon Jack Grealish just edges them. Why? SEO, maybe. But also because he’s a Premier League-proven talent who, under the right manager, can still be one of the most dangerous wingers in Europe.",
      "We’re not sure if Grealish is the type of player who lacks confidence, but what we do know is that the freedom and eccentricity he once oozed has been stripped away under Pep Guardiola. He was electric at Aston Villa, prompting Man City to break the British transfer record to sign him, only to reinvent him as a risk-averse wide-midfielder who keeps the ball safe at all costs. Jeremy Doku, by contrast, has been given a free pass to run at full-backs like it’s a playground kickabout.",
      "Someone needs to get us the old Grealish back. We miss him dearly.",
      "",
      "9) Antoine Semenyo (Bournemouth)\nAfter racking up 11 goals and six assists in 37 Premier League games, Antoine Semenyo is a wanted man. He really does strike us as a future Tottenham Hotspur player, and with them back in the Champions League, the Ghanaian will surely be tempted – even more so if Daniel Levy swaps Ange Postecoglou for Andoni Iraola.",
      "Semenyo, still raw at 25, had a highly productive season. Bournemouth reportedly want £70million – which he’s definitely not worth. Fair enough for them to aim high, but thankfully for everyone’s sake, Manchester United can’t afford to get suckered in. Then again, they might lose the plot after Liam Delap chose Chelsea.",
      "",
      "8) Takefusa Kubo (Real Sociedad)\nThere’s a £50.2million release clause in Kubo’s contract, with Real Madrid due 50% of any sale – meaning they could bring him back for a bargain £25m if they wanted. But Los Blancos already have more attacking depth than they know what to do with. Arda Guler and Brahim Diaz barely get a look-in as it is.",
      "Kubo was one of Europe’s top take-on artists in 2024/25, even if five goals and zero assists in 36 La Liga games is bleak. Still, Alexander Isak only got six in his final season at Sociedad, and he’s done alright since.",
      "The Japanese winger is a menace in possession, with progressive carry and foul-winning numbers that compare well with Mo Salah, Raphinha, Lamine Yamal and Vinicius Jr. He’s also one of the best defensive workers among that group. There’s a serious Premier League player in there.",
      "",
      "7) Marcus Rashford (Manchester United)\nAre we naïve to keep convincing ourselves he’s still a potentially elite forward? Possibly. But Marcus Rashford’s brief resurgence on loan at Aston Villa reignited that belief. Confidence and happiness make all the difference, and for the first time in ages, he looked like he was enjoying himself.",
      "Playing for Manchester United could make Mr Tumble miserable these days. It’s a graveyard for players. McTominay, Antony and Rashford have all escaped and immediately thrived elsewhere. Actual Scott McTominay has been named Serie A’s best player, for crying out loud.",
      "Wages are the stumbling block. Only a few clubs can afford his wages, and many might think twice. Did Rashford down tools after signing a big-money contract extension, or was he just another victim of the Old Trafford malaise?",
      "Either way, the Villa revival has been massive. A move abroad may be best, but don’t rule out an intra-Premier League switch.",
      "",
      "6) Leroy Sane (Bayern Munich)\nA free transfer makes Leroy Sane a very tasty proposition. He’s Prem-proven, which matters, but he hasn’t played in England since 2020 and is now 29 – just a year younger than a finished Raheem Sterling.",
      "He’s reportedly been offered to Spurs and is on Arsenal’s shortlist. As a freebie, his wage demands will be monstrous, and he’ll want a long contract well into his twilight.",
      "But if you can stomach the wages, there’s no transfer fee, and he remains a brilliant addition for a top club.",
      "",
      "5) Rayan Cherki (Lyon)\nCherki’s best position is still up for debate, but his ability to play anywhere across the front line makes him extremely appealing.",
      "His numbers this season were brilliant: 12 goals and 20 assists in 44 appearances, with 11 assists and 8 goals in Ligue 1 alone. He’s up there for key passes too, with 75 across the top five leagues.",
      "He’s already waved goodbye to Lyon fans, and the club desperately need a big sale. While some reports claimed a release clause of £18.9m, David Ornstein shut that down, confirming there isn’t one and that Lyon will want a much bigger fee.",
      "Borussia Dortmund are interested, and Manchester City are sniffing around as they prepare for life after Kevin De Bruyne – who will reportedly join Napoli on a free.",
      "",
      "4) Bryan Mbeumo (Brentford)\nTwenty Premier League goals this season says it all, really. At 25, Mbeumo is a proven scorer, versatile, and should be available for a cut-price fee with just one year left on his deal.",
      "He feels like a can’t-miss signing. Arsenal, Newcastle and Man United have all been linked.",
      "Newcastle need a right-winger despite Jacob Murphy’s freak season. Arsenal wouldn’t start him ahead of Bukayo Saka, but there’s a world where they co-exist, even if pushing either to the left isn’t ideal.",
      "Still, Mbeumo would improve any top side needing an X-factor.",
      "",
      "3) Nico Williams (Athletic Club)\nA £45m release clause for a player of Nico Williams’ talent is outrageous. But the full cost – including wages and bonuses – makes him an expensive project. Barcelona have walked away. Last summer, Arsenal and Chelsea didn’t bite the bullet.",
      "His Euro 2024 was electric, but five goals and five assists for Bilbao this past season didn’t boost his stock much. That said, the talent is unquestionable. He’s ready for a step up.",
      "",
      "2) Rafael Leao (AC Milan)\nIt feels like time for Leao to leave Milan. Chelsea are probably out – they’re welcoming Estevao and Kendry Paez this summer – but Arsenal’s need for a left-winger is glaring. How they let Khvicha Kvaratskhelia go to PSG without a fight is baffling.",
      "With Grealish likely off and Doku not fully convincing, City could come calling too. Newcastle or Liverpool would also make sense – the former especially, as Leao would be a major statement.",
      "",
      "1) Rodrygo (Real Madrid)\nIf Arsenal sign Rodrygo, it would have real Alexis Sanchez vibes. A genuine elite winger, an X-factor star, and the sort of player who deserves to be more than a supporting act.",
      "Real Madrid are all about Kylian Mbappe, Jude Bellingham and Vinicius now. Rodrygo, despite being a proven match-winner with two Champions Leagues and three La Liga titles, seems expendable.",
      "He should be one of the poster boys at a top club – and most English sides can offer him that. He might just be the best player available this summer.",
      "READ NOW: How Andrea Berta should spend his £300m to win Arsenal the Premier League title",

      "It is noted that ‘the fact his representative travelled to Riyadh is an intriguing twist’, especially considering ‘talks at the Four Seasons hotel are believed to have continued late into the night’.",

      "Resigning themselves to the fact the Premier League was going to be incredibly tough. Resigning themselves to losing most games. Resigning themselves to being patronisingly told to stop playing in a naive possession-based style despite not in fact playing that. Resigning themselves to being last on Match of the Day. Resigning themselves to relegation.",
      "But now, Ipswich fans are resigning themselves to something else: the prospect of losing their best player this summer.",
      "The revelation that Liam Delap has a £30m release clause should the club go down was like the doors being swung open on a Black Friday stampede. Teams from across the Premier League were jostling to be first to the checkout, with Chelsea seemingly winning the race to sign a striker who is perhaps worth double that.",
      "Ipswich fans have no ill will to the notion of Delap moving. Selling your best players to bigger clubs is the fate of being a non-elite side and £30million is no small amount for a club like ours – far more than the £3million we got for Aaron Cresswell, who has gone on to make over 300 appearances in the Premier League. (yes it still annoys me.)",
      "Your only hope is that these players stay long enough to give you some good memories. In Liam Delap, that has very much been the case.",
      "I will be the first to admit I had my doubts when we signed him. He cost £15m, making him the second-most-expensive signing in Town’s history and while our most expensive signing – Omari Hutchinson – had at least spent a year on loan with us, Delap was more of an unknown.",
      "For a start, he could have been seen as a Man City cast-off and even if he had a promising season at Hull in 2023/24, the fact City were willing to let him go suggested they did not fully believe in his potential.",
      "But in Kieran McKenna we trust and it took just three games before Town fans had a new hero, his goal against Fulham securing the club’s first point in the Premier League for 22 years.",
      "Analysing a player in 2025 can be done in two ways – the hard data of stats or, for lack of a better term, vibes.",
      "If we start off with the more easily quantifiable stats, Delap is ticking every box. Top goalscorer at the club by a mile; 12 goals from an xG of 9.02; 2.31 shots a game, 1.4 successful dribbles, 3.68 touches in the opposition box and 1.75 fouls won, all for an Ipswich side that has not had time for much attacking this season.",
      "Internationally, he won the Under-19 Euros with England, has played in every age group up to the U-21 level, and recently trained with the senior side – pictured alongside Harry Kane who some predict he will one day replace.",
      "But boiling Delap down to stats misses why he has become such a fan favourite at the club. xG and xA are grand but you would have to create a metric of ‘xTimes run into an opponent, flinging them to the ground and somehow getting away with it much to the fans’ delight’ to truly capture the essence of Delap.",
      "In many ways, he is a traditional number nine. Kick the ball up long and he will become a whirlwind of elbows and arms as he tries to hold off the often much bigger defenders. Ipswich’s first game of the season saw Liverpool visit Portman Road and Town fans soon saw what Delap was about when he sent Virgil van Dijk – and himself – tumbling to the ground.",
      "Playing Ipswich has not been the hardest prospect for anybody this season, but centre-backs will have come away glad that the annoying buzzing bee of Delap is gone.",
      "He can trap the ball, a vital skill for a team under pressure, and on the rare occasion Ipswich wingers were not pegged back, he is able to play smart one-twos and create shots at goal.",
      "He also has the technique to be an adept finisher. His goal away at Aston Villa highlights perhaps the very best of Delap, muscling past two defenders before getting the slightest of touches to steer the ball into the net.",
      "But while number 9s of yesteryear were perhaps a bit slow, a bit too stationary and more focused on putting the ball in the net rather than getting it into a position to do so – Delap is very much the opposite.",
      "His 1.85m build is almost all legs, followed by a fridge-freezer of a chest, which he will more than happily slam into defenders. He is happy to pick the ball up and just run at defenders, a trait that has been passed out of the game of late. Only three players at Ipswich complete more dribbles per 90 than Delap; only two of those have a higher success rate.",
      "He scores tap-ins, he scores penalties, he scores goals from the edge of the area, he scores goals having dribbled his way through a defence. Aside from a 40-yard-volley or a bicycle kick, Delap has treated Ipswich fans to almost every kind of goal there is. Considering chances are few and far between, this ability to turn even the sniff of an opportunity into a goal has been crucial for Town. In Ipswich’s four wins this season, he has scored in three of them.",
      "Delap is also just about on the right side of being slightly unhinged. No forward in the league has been booked more than him this season and those yellows have almost always been fouls committed by steamrolling a just little too hard into an opponent.",
      "But in the same way that if you took away Wayne Rooney’s aggression the player would suffer, telling Delap to calm down may well take away what makes him so good and so endearing to his own club’s supporters. Like a Luis Suarez minus the biting.",
      "Of the top strikers in the league, it is perhaps only Erling Haaland that plays in the same way and while the Norwegian is a more lethal finisher, Delap certainly has the advantage when it comes to pace. Other strikers meanwhile prefer to create as much as they score, passing the ball to the side rather than running at defences.",

      "Even before he moved to Ipswich, he was singled out for praise with Hull boss Liam Rosenior calling him “a special, special talent”. Since moving to Suffolk, his stock has only risen. McKenna, who is not known for his overly emotive language, said not only has he “evolved his game” but he was “incredibly receptive and very football smart”.",
      "Scoring goals for Ipswich is one thing, doing so at Stamford Bridge is another, but it is hard to see how he will not be loved by fans.",

      "Liam Delap has ‘given the green light’ for Chelsea to sign him this summer despite previously ‘leaning towards’ a move to Manchester United.",

      "Manchester United hero Patrice Evra has hit out at the Red Devils fans over their “disgusting” treatment of one player as Ruben Amorim claims his side “choke in every game”.",
      "United lost the Europa League final to Spurs last week at the end of a miserable season which saw them finish 15th in the Premier League having won just 11 of their 38 games.",
      "They immediately jetted off to Malaysia for a post-season tour and were booed off the pitch after a 1-0 defeat to ASEAN All-Stars.",
      "And Amorim couldn’t hide his frustration after the game, insisting his side can’t help but “choke in every game” they play.",
      "“Yes, a disappointing result, but no injuries and a tough pitch,” he said. “We don’t have it in us not to choke in every exercise, in every game, that is what happened.",
      "“We should win these kind of games, no matter what. We need to bring that inside of us in every game.",
      "“The important thing is no injuries with this weather and to arrive here in this day. It is not an excuse, we should perform better.”",
      "Amorim said that he felt guilty about results and even welcomed the boos which greeted the final whistle.",
      "“I feel always guilty,” he said. “I said that in the last game. I am always guilty of the performance of the team no matter and since I am here in the first day, I am guilty.",
      "“Then the boos from the fans, I think it’s something that we need maybe because every game that we lost in the Premier League they were always there (cheering us).",
      "“So, it’s like the way of playing. If they see that it’s not working, they will change the way they behave.",
      "“But I felt then when we finished and we walk away, like every time, the supporters were with us. Let’s wait for the next season.”",
      "Harry Maguire captained United in their opening game and having been one of Amorim’s more consistent players this season, Evra hit out at the club’s fans, claiming they’ve “bullied” the England international, who deserves “a lot of credit” for his performances of late.",
      "“Now everyone behind his computer can judge you. What they did to Harry Maguire was disgusting,” Evra said.",
      "“Lot of things like that. I think that it’s bullying because they were like, he’s the worst player in the history. We bought him for like £80m.",
      "“They went to his house. They did like lot of things. And for him, that’s why I give him a lot of credit to stick and to stay at Man United and what he’s doing, the way he’s performing.”",
      "A former Manchester United star has revealed his main ‘fear’ with Ruben Amorim as the ‘jury is out’ on the under-fire Red Devils head coach.",
      "Manchester United winger Amad Diallo has revealed the feeling in the Red Devils squad after reports that Ruben Amorim essentially told Alejandro Garnacho his career there was over.",
      "Man Utd have lost the Europa League final, leading to calls for the end of the Ruben Amorim experiment. So who next?",
      "Amorim has made up his mind and ‘the talk’ at Man Utd has now turned to where the midfielder might go and how much they can get for him.",
      "Former Premier League boss Jose Mourinho has given his reaction to Tottenham beating Man Utd 1-0 in the Europa League final last week.",
      "According to reports, head coach Ruben Amorim has issued a ‘brutal message’ to Manchester United winger Alejandro Garnacho, who has been ‘kicked out’."

      "United were booed in parts for their lacklustre display by those in attendance and, reacting to his side's reception in the Malaysian capital, Amorim said: \"I'm always guilty of the performance of the team, no matter what. Since I've been here from the first day, I am guilty. The boos from the fans is something that we need, maybe.

      "\"We always prepare two plans,\" said the Portuguese at the start of the club's preseason tour of Malaysia and Hong Kong. \"With and without the Champions League. Without the Champions League, we also don't need a big squad.",

      "Wednesday 28 May 2025 12:31, UK",
      "The transfer window is opening earlier than usual this summer ahead of FIFA's newly expanded Club World Cup - but what can we expect?",
      "Cristiano Ronaldo and Trent Alexander-Arnold could be among those on the move with FIFA keen for its new-look tournament to have a star-studded cast in the United States.",
      "Premier League clubs Chelsea and Manchester City are competing with the likes of Real Madrid, Bayern Munich, Paris Saint-Germain and Inter Milan.",
      "Clubs can sign new players from June 1-10 before the tournament kicks off on June 15.",
      "And this is not limited to the 32 participating teams - which means there could be a big flurry of early transfer activity this summer.",
      "Club World Cup teams can also use an in-tournament registration period after the group stages from June 27-July 3 to add players to their squads.",
      "FIFA have incentivised clubs to make their squads as strong as possible, with a prize of £97m for the winners.",
      "The tournament format works exactly the same as the FIFA World Cup, only for clubs.\n\n\nThe 32 teams have been divided into eight groups of four teams, with the top two teams in each group qualifying for the knockout stage.\n\n\nThe last-16 stage - the first single knockout round - then moves to the quarter-final, semi-final and then final. There is no third-place play-off between the two losing semi-final teams.\n\n\nThe tournament runs from June 15, with the final taking place on July 13.",
      "Cristiano Ronaldo attracts attention like few others on the planet - so it was no surprise to see FIFA president Gianni Infantino reveal discussions had taken place for him to sign for a Club World Cup team. His great rival, Lionel Messi, will be there with Inter Miami.",
      "The five-time Ballon d'Or winner fuelled speculation further by hinting he is leaving Saudi Pro League club Al Nassr in a cryptic post to his 654 million Instagram followers - though it is not yet clear at this stage which club he could join.",
      "Ronaldo would either need to be released early from his £177m-per-year deal, which runs out at the end of June, or move after the group stages on a free transfer in the extra in-tournament registration period.",
      "Reports have linked him with Saudi club Al Hilal, who face Ronaldo's former team Real Madrid in their opening game.",
      "Trent Alexander-Arnold may have to wait to join Real Madrid unless a fee can be agreed with Liverpool to sign the full-back before his contract expires on June 30.",
      "Real Madrid will have Dean Huijsen in Xabi Alonso's squad after agreeing a deal with Bournemouth for the centre-back to join in time for the Club World Cup.",
      "Athletic Club winger Nico Williams - who has been of interest to Arsenal for a year - has been linked with Real Madrid and reportedly has a release clause of around £48m.",
      "Chelsea could also be active in the mini-window with signing a forward one of their aims this summer. Ipswich's Liam Delap is a deal that could be done early due to his £30m release clause - but Manchester United and Newcastle United are also trying to sign him.",
      "Hugo Ekitike, Viktor Gyokeres, Benjamin Sesko and Jonathan David are their other striker targets, with transfer strategy being discussed in more detail after the UEFA Conference League final against Real Betis. Signing a winger and a centre-back is also a possibility.",
      "Manchester City are in the market for a No 10 this summer to replace Kevin De Bruyne with Morgan Gibbs-White and Dani Olmo among those they like.",
      "De Bruyne will still be contracted to City when the tournament begins but has said he is unlikely to take part and is now closing in on a free transfer to Napoli.",
      "Tijani Reijnders, a central midfielder for AC Milan, is another City admire, while they are also looking to strengthen at full-back. As it stands, City appear in no rush to get deals done ahead of the tournament.",
      "Al Hilal are interested in Manchester United captain Bruno Fernandes, who raised concerns he could leave after the Europa League final defeat when he admitted the club could cash in on him. Ruben Amorim, his head coach, has said he wants to keep the midfielder.",
      "Given the financial heft of the Saudi Pro League club and speculation about the big transfer fee they could offer United, whose need to sell this summer has been well documented, there is an understandable sense of dread among fans about Fernandes.",
      "United are set to take advantage of the earlier window themselves by sealing a deal for Matheus Cunha from Wolves after activating his £62.5m release clause. Arsenal are also confident of landing Real Sociedad midfielder Martin Zubimendi.",
      "Both of those deals can be completed ahead of June 1 - but the players will only be registered with the club once the mini-window opens.",
      "Atletico Madrid boss Diego Simeone is keen to add to his squad before the Club World Cup and are the Spanish club are set to test Tottenham's resolve over defender Cristian Romero by making an approach for the World Cup winner.",
      "It is not clear whether Spurs chairman Daniel Levy will be willing to discuss the sale of Romero after Spurs won the Europa League to qualify for next season's Champions League. The 27-year-old, who has two years left on his deal, has said he would love to play in LaLiga.",
      "Ange Postecoglou has urged Spurs to keep hold of Romero, though the head coach's future in north London is uncertain after a dismal Premier League campaign, which saw them finish 17th.",

      "Wednesday 28 May 2025 15:49, UK",
      "Matheus Cunha is set to undergo a medical at Manchester United after the terms of his £62.5m release clause at Wolves were met.",

      "The forward has enjoyed a standout season at Wolves, scoring 17 goals and providing six assists across 34 appearances.",
      "\"What happened [on Tuesday] is that United contacted Wolves and said they would like to trigger the clause but would like to pay the £62.5m in five instalments.",
      "\"Wolves turned around and said you've got to read the contract, it's there in black and white - we signed a new contract with the player in January, these are the terms of the contract, if you want him, the £62.5m needs to be paid in three instalments over two years. United have gone back to Wolves and said they'll accept those terms.",
      "\"United don't want to waste any time, they are pushing ahead to sign him and Wolves have said fine that's all good, you've triggered the release clause, we will now give you permission to speak to the player and also for the player to have a medical.",
      "\"So if all goes well with the medical, Matheus Cunha will become a Manchester United player.",
      "\"A lot of people who don't support Manchester United are asking, 'Where's the money coming from? We thought United were in trouble financially, we thought they'd missed out on the Champions League, potentially £100m. How come straight away they can afford to sign Matheus Cunha?'",
      "\"The £62.5m is not being paid in one lump sum, like most transfers, it's being paid in instalments and it's going to be three instalments of £21m.",
      "\"For a club the size of Manchester United, you would have to say that is affordable. They have got financial fair play PSR concerns like all other clubs, players will be leaving Manchester United this summer as well but Cunha won't be the only signing.",
      "\"I think they will make other signings, but the signings really have to work because you speak to a lot of people in football and they will tell you Manchester United's recruitment has just not been good enough.\""

      "Tuesday 27 May 2025 15:53, UK",
      "Antony has revealed he considered retiring during his lowest moment at Manchester United but says he is \"smiling and happy\" at Real Betis.",
      "The 25-year-old Brazilian winger, who signed for United from Ajax for £85m in September 2022, joined the LaLiga side on loan in January after struggling at Old Trafford.",
      "Antony scored just 12 times in 96 appearances for Manchester United, playing only 14 times this season under Erik ten Hag and then Ruben Amorim.",
      "Antony was the subject of allegations of domestic abuse by three women in September 2023, though he was not arrested or charged in either Brazil or the UK and denies the allegations.",
      "The case in Brazil closed in August 2024 but the Greater Manchester Police investigation into alleged incidents said to have occurred in the UK remains open.",
      "Ten Hag said in January last year that Antony's \"off-field issues\" had impacted his form, and on the eve of Betis' Conference League final against Chelsea, the winger teared up when speaking about the effect it had on him.",
      "\"I went through some very difficult times there that ended up affecting me a lot. But I am very grateful even for these difficult moments that I went through. Today, I feel much more mature, much more prepared, I feel much better.",
      "\"It was a moment when I thought about stopping playing. I no longer felt that desire to play football because of everything I was going through, because of all the accusations and because I had remained silent for so long.",
      "\"[My career] has changed a lot [at Betis]. It changed a lot because I needed to find myself, for everything I went through there in my personal life. I wanted to do things, but it seemed like it wasn't happening because I wasn't happy, I wasn't feeling that desire to play football anymore, and I needed to find myself.",
      "\"Playing football was always something that I loved and I went through difficult times when I didn't feel that pleasure anymore.",
      "\"I would always talk to my brother, I used to say, 'I can't do it anymore, I can't do it anymore'. He said: 'Hold on a little longer and things will change'.",
      "\"I even get emotional because it was very difficult for me. Only I know what it was like inside the house, not even having the strength to even play with my son, having days without eating, staying in my room.",
      "\"It was very complicated but with the help of my family with the help of God, I managed to turn things around. I'm already very happy here.\"",
      "Antony has scored nine goals and produced five assists in 25 appearances for Betis, becoming one of the standout players in Spain during the second half of the season.",
      "They have lost just four times since he arrived, helping them to finish sixth in LaLiga and reach the Conference League final as they bid for their first-ever European trophy.",
      "Antony praised head coach Manuel Pellegrini for helping him rediscover his form in his usual position on the right wing.",
      "\"From the first conversation I had with him, he gave me incredible confidence, he made me feel very comfortable,\" said Antony.",
      "\"And when I got here, the conversation we had was very positive. He told me: 'I know your potential, you didn't join the national team for nothing, you didn't play in a World Cup for nothing, you know what a player you are, you've been through difficult times and you have your responsibilities, you have your part of the blame too'. But he made me feel very comfortable.",
      "\"He always gave me a lot of confidence and he always told me: 'I don't want you to make 20 plays, I want you to make five, six with the aim of scoring, an assist, that will already help me a lot.",
      "\"I took all that advice and Pellegrini is a coach that I'm very grateful to.\"",
      "Antony joined Betis on a straight loan deal with his Manchester United contract running until 2027, with a club-held option of a further year.",
      "Antony admitted he has some regrets about his time at Manchester United and said he doesn't know what the future will hold.",
      "\"I have the feeling that I could have done more with the United jersey but I'm also very grateful for everyone's affection that I had there,\" he said. \"I even have a lot of contact there.",
      "\"It was a difficult moment that I went through, and today I'm smiling here and I'm happy.",
      "\"I always say that I'm doing my part. I'm playing football, I'm happy and I'm doing well. I don't know about the future.",
      "\"I'll keep doing my part so that when the transfer window opens, my agents are working on it. But now my focus is on doing well and we'll see what happens in the future.\"",
