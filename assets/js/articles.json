      "Erik ten Hag was quick to hit back at suggestions his Manchester United defence needed to address major issues as stats were put to him following the loss at Chelsea",
      "Erik ten Hag claimed it was \"ridiculous\" to use stats to suggest Manchester United's defence needs work - despite them facing a staggering amount of shots on their goal.",
      "Prior to their clash in west London, the Red Devils had the fourth-best defence in the Premier League, with only title contenders Arsenal, Liverpool and Manchester City shipping fewer. However, Ten Hag's side have faced more than 200 shots since the turn of the year.",
      "On Thursday evening, Chelsea had 28 strikes on the United goal as their backline struggled to halt their opponents. Those numbers were put to the Dutchman, but has he was quick to dismiss the criticism when it was suggested that such a trend was \"unsustainable\".",
      "United conceded two early goals at Stamford Bridge before they fought back to lead 3-2. However, a 99th-minute penalty allowed Cole Palmer to equaliser and the Chelsea playmaker then capitalised on some slack defending to pick the ball up from a corner before his deflected effort won the contest.",
      "Despite their collapse in stoppage time, Ten Hag was adamant that his visiting outfit were the dominant side in the capital. He also bemoaned the late penalty - Chelsea's second of the night - which was given against Diogo Dalot.",
      "\"Yes we started poor, kicking the ball away and defending poorly,\" he said. \"But you saw we were dominating the game and it was brilliant how we played – we deserved to win the game. But, you cannot give it away like we did and we have to manage this game better.",
      "\"It is a team performance, you can point to one of the players but it is about team performance. When it gets chaotic you have to deal with it as a team and we made the wrong decisions and we didn’t help out as a team. Out of possession we made bad decision – a lack of concentration. Also, I think unlucky at the end with the penalty situation, questionable and very soft but we have to do better.\"",
      "Ten Hag's hopes of delivering Champions League football were dealt another blow as they failed to capitalise on Aston Villa's loss 24 hours earlier. It means they and Tottenham still hold notable points leads over the Red Devils.",

      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe was inside Stamford Bridge on Thursday night to see Erik ten Hag's Manchester United side throw away three points in dramatic and damning circumstances",
      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe may be a Manchester United fan, but his primary reason for being at Stamford Bridge on Thursday night wasn’t to support the team: it was to gather information on his investment.",
      "Ratcliffe was sat stony faced in the stands at Chelsea – a club he also tried to buy – alongside his close confidant Sir Dave Brailsford and Peter Schmeichel – a timely reminder of the club's former glories – as his United side somehow conspired to throw away three points. United had come from 2-0 down to lead 3-2, yet conceded twice in the final few minutes to lose 4-3.",
      "Having conceded in the 99th minute to draw at Brentford on Saturday, United went one worse, shipping two goals in the 100th and 101st minute at Chelsea. First Diogo Dalot brought down Noni Madueke to give Cole Palmer a second penalty of the day, then the entire defence fell asleep to allow Palmer to smash in from a quickly-taken corner.",
      "That is five points dropped in a few minutes and it leaves United sixth, 11 points adrift of the top four, with an embarrassing goal difference of -1 after their 12th league defeat of the season. The next game? Against league leaders Liverpool at Old Trafford on Sunday.",
      "It’s not looking good and, if there was any doubt left about the future of Erik ten Hag, it has now been cleared up: he’s toast. Ratcliffe and his INEOS colleagues have been making moves since getting their foot in the door, hiring Omar Berrada while chasing Dan Ashworth and Jason Wilcox.",
      "There have been reports of their interest in Gareth Southgate and Gary O’Neil as the new leadership group plots a path forwards. On the one hand, Ratcliffe is a United fan. On the other he is a cold-blooded petrochemicals billionaire who has spent £1.3billion and is looking for a return on that investment.",
      "Ten Hag was warned back in October about what to expect from Ratcliffe, who owns a one-third share in the Mercedes Formula 1 team. As Mercedes team principal Tofo Wollf explained: “This is a no bull**** organisation. They are huge in terms of revenue and profit. Decisions are being made quickly – three bullet points on a page and ‘here we go’. With Jim all the bull**** is cut out.”",
      "Thanks for the memories Erik, but you’re out in the summer. As he said himself after the Chelsea loss: “In five days, we dropped five points – that’s unacceptable. The quality of our football is really high, but football is abouts results.” There is little point in pulling the trigger yet, with faint hopes of finishing in the top four gone and eight league games remaining – but while they are getting the hierarchy sorted behind the scenes, you can be sure they are doing the same with the front of house.",
      "Ratcliffe’s words in February are instructive on his approach. “We have to look at the organisation of the club, because it is not good at the moment,” he told Belgian newspaper De Tijd. “Take the head coach, for example: he must report directly to the CEO. That is no longer possible in a modern football organisation.",
      "“We have to ensure that the right people end up in the right positions. Every person in management must be world class. And then it is important to create a positive, supportive, friendly and high-quality environment. That culture was missing before. Only in such an environment can you get the best out of sportsmen. If successful, the results will follow automatically. That's the plan and I believe in it.”",
      "In the past few games, United have done a fine job of proving that Ten Hag is not world class. Ratcliffe simply won’t accept mediocrity in the most important position of all at the helm of his latest investment.",

      "Luke Littler claimed Premier League glory as he saw off Gerwyn Price - just as his beloved Manchester United conceded twice in stoppage time to lose late on at Chelsea",
      "Luke Littler admits he was gutted to see Manchester United concede two late goals just as he celebrated another Premier League triumph.",
      "The teenage sensation won his first event in Belfast last week and has backed that up in Manchester. Littler saw off Michael van Gerwen and Nathan Aspinall en route to the final, before he beat Gerwyn Price to succeed when his football team fell short.",
      "Whilst Littler was hitting all the right numbers, United were unable to hold onto their lead. The Red Devils trailed 2-0 at Chelsea, then scored three times to find themselves 3-2 in front and closing in on a memorable win. That was before Cole Palmer's late heroics.",
      "The Blues' playmaker scored a penalty in the 99th minute before he followed that up with a 101st-minute winner, which deflected off Scott McTominay. Littler saw his team spurn their lead just as he sealed his success with a double top to see off the Welshman.",
      "He said: \"I’m glad I won, I just saw United concede two in two minutes. I am glad to win. I have settled into it. The first 5-6 weeks I won the first game and then lost and lost. But winning last week gave me so much confidence coming to Manchester. I saw he was 4-0 up, averaging 123, I was like: ‘Stop it, stop it Gezzy.’ But I then focused and practiced, I left it until the end.",
      "“I go whatever way I feel on the board. If I am comfortable, I will try to go for it. Tonight, we did all our own thing. Last week the practice paid off. Same as tonight. It has paid off. There are 6-7 weeks to go, I have to plug away, get 2-3 points each week, and I am sure I will make the play-offs. The crowd have been amazing.\"",
      "Littler's victory over Price in the final saw him move above world No 1 Luke Humphries in the table and put himself in a great position to qualify for the play-off stage. Before last week's success in Belfast the teenager was outside of the play-off spots, but has quickly turned that around.",
      "Back in January, Littler visited United's training base as his profile continues to rise at a rapid rate. He was given a signed shirt by his favourite player, Alejandro Garnacho, who scored two of their three goals in the loss at Chelsea.",
      "The 17-year-old also signalled his ambition to win one of dart's majors and parade it around Old Trafford. “Hopefully, I can win the world championship or even a major trophy this year – one of the five or six majors that are on offer – and take it to Old Trafford,\" he said."

      "Erik ten Hag has urged his Manchester United players to take responsibility for their mistakes after succumbing to a gut-wrenching defeat at Stamford Bridge.",
      "United were 3-2 up and on the way to a much-needed win on Thursday night, only to allow Cole Palmer to score twice in injury time to secure victory for Chelsea. The defeat was all the more painful considering United had shown character to come from 2-0 down and conceded two penalties.",
      "Conor Gallagher put Chelsea ahead before Palmer’s first penalty of the night for Antony’s foul on Marc Cucurella. United fought back, with Alejandro Garnacho seizing on a mistake from Moises Caicedo, Bruno Fernandes heading in at the back post and Garnacho nodding Antony’s cross past Djordje Petrovic.",
      "But all their hard work was undone in the final few minutes as Diogo Dalot brought down Noni Madueke for Palmer to equalise from the spot. The away side then switched off from a corner, allowing Palmer to blast in the winner, via a deflection off Scott McTominay.",
      "Ten Hag was furious at how the match ended and suggested there was a lack of leadership and organisation on the pitch. \"We started poorly by giving the ball away, defending poorly on the first two occasions, but by that moment already, you saw we were dominating the game and we returned in the game,” he said. “It was brilliant how we played and we deserved to win this game. But you can't give it away like we did.",

      "“We made the wrong decisions and we didn't help each other in possession as well. [We should have been] keeping the ball, going from one side to the other side, or at least pass and move. In and out of possession, we made bad decisions.\"",
      "United remain sixth in the Premier League and their faint hopes of gate-crashing the top four have now ended, with an 11-point gap to Aston Villa. Having thrown away five points in injury-time against Brentford and Chelsea, Ten Hag’s side have won just one of their last five league matches and have a goal difference of -1 ahead of Liverpool's visit to Old Trafford on Sunday.",
      "\"It's definitely a setback, but now we have to deal with this, to get up again and we will do,” he added. “We are resilient. You have seen today how resilient we are, how we returned in the game, the quality of our football, how we can play outstanding football in moments, some really high [moments].

      "Manchester United's Premier League clash against rivals Liverpool kicks off Sunday's strong bill of strangely timed fixtures - but there is method in the madness",
      "The Premier League kick-off times for this Sunday might leave fans scratching their heads.",
      "Manchester United’s clash with Liverpool kicks off at 3.30pm which is an hour earlier than Sky’s usual Super Sunday prime slot. Then Tottenham’s clash with Nottingham Forest kicks off at 6pm while Sheffield United’s game with Chelsea at Bramall Lane has been put back to 5.30pm.",
      "Confused? Probably. There is a particular reason behind Tottenham’s clash with Forest being shifted from the original Monday Night Football slot because train strikes mean there is no public transport from London to Nottingham.",
      "The Blades pushed their game back from 1pm to 5.30pm because of the Sheffield Half Marathon taking place on Sunday morning and it goes right past Bramall Lane. Chelsea fans can get home via train after the game. But there has been a general shift in kick-off times this season and a move away from 2pm and 4.30pm being set in stone.",
      "TV companies, police, the clubs, Premier League officials and local authorities will discuss their preferred times but ultimately the Safety Advisory Group have the final say based on fan safety. An hour’s less drinking time which can feed into trouble within stadiums but, ultimately, the police have taken a stricter view in the wake of the Casey Report into the crowd trouble at the Euros final at Wembley in 2021.",
      "The police have introduced more banning orders, have been determined to crack down on excess drinking and drugs within stadiums and that is a factor in why they have taken a tougher stance on kick-off times. They are prepared to compromise - like moving Sunday’s clash at Old Trafford to 3.30pm - but are wary of the 4.30pm slots for high risk games such as the forthcoming North London derby being played at 2pm for Sky on Sunday, April 28.",
      "Last year, a fan was banned for four years after attacking Arsenal keeper Aaron Ramsdale in the game at Tottenham which did kick off at 4.30pm in the Super Sunday slot. The UK Football Policing Unit (UKFPU) told Mirror Sport: “The decision to request a change to a match kick-off time is an operational matter for individual police forces.",
      "“This is then subject to an independent assessment by the relevant Safety Advisory Group who will make a recommendation to the licensing authority, usually the local authority. Public safety is always the primary concern for policing when proposing a change to a scheduled kick-off time.”",
      "The final day of the Premier League season kicks off at 4pm and it is noticeable there are no high risk games. Mind you, if Arsenal are chasing the title and Everton are in danger of going down, then it might be reclassified…",
      "======================",
      "One of the key reasons that Liverpool want Sporting Lisbon boss Ruben Amorim is his track record on developing players.",
      "They have brought through the likes of ex-Spurs starlet Marcus Edwards, former Coventry striker Viktor Gyökeres and also turned Gonçalo Inácio into a highly sought after Portugal international. Amorim’s backroom staff - including B coach Filipe Celikkaya - are highly regarded and would fit the mould of working with young players, respecting the values of the academy and improving stars.",
      "Gyökeres, 25, is an incredible story. From joining Sporting from Coventry for £20m in 2023, he is now on the radar of some of Europe’s top clubs - including Arsenal - after a prolific season for goals and assists in Portugal. However, Gyökeres was anything but a secret at Coventry. So many Premier League clubs looked into buying him last summer which is either a damning indictment of their scouting or a slice of genius on Sporting’s part.",
      "However, it is hard to imagine anyone will admit such a costly mistake and pay his £86m release clause with Coventry due a huge slice of any profit.",
      "====================",
      "The Professional Footballers’ Association will hold their awards ceremony in August in Manchester with a similar theatre vibe like last year rather than a dinner.",
      "Voting has already started among EFL members while the Premier League and WSL get a while longer to decide with both titles up for grabs. There is a common voting deadline of June 9 which is also after the Champions League final.",
      "The PFA do something remarkable which is to act for players at all levels, going up to multi-millionaire stars, in an industry filled with wealth but all of their members respect the trade union philosophy.",
      "==================",
      "Kieran Tierney's loan move from Arsenal to Real Sociedad was an eye-catching one as it was out of left field.",
      "However, maybe as time goes by, it becomes easier to understand as Tierney is a fine player and his switch might just bolster relations between the two clubs with Arsenal keen on Sociedad’s Spain midfielder Martín Zubimendi this summer.",

      "Cole Palmer may have been the match-winner, but it was Enzo Fernandez who earned the plaudits from Chelsea fans after the dramatic win over Manchester United.",
      "Palmer scored twice in injury time to earn a remarkable 4-3 victory at Stamford Bridge on Thursday night. Chelsea raced into a 2-0 lead through Conor Gallagher’s early strike and Palmer’s penalty, but allowed United back into it.",
      "Moises Caicedo’s mistake was pounced upon by Alejandro Garnacho, Bruno Fernandes headed in at the back post and Garnacho nodded Antony’s cross past Djordje Petrovic to put United 3-2 up. United appeared to be holding on for a famous comeback win until Diogo Dalot fouled Noni Madueke, allowing Palmer to score his second penalty of the night for 3-3.",
      "That was dramatic enough, but it didn’t end there, with Fernandez’s quick corner allowing Palmer the space to smash in a deflected winner. That assist earned the Argentina World Cup winner some praise – but it was his confrontations with Mount that really got the home fans going.",
      "Mount left Chelsea for United in a £55million transfer in the summer, which saw him turn from homegrown hero to villain in the eyes of many supporters. After coming on as an 86th-minute substitute for Garnacho, Mount was subjected to booing, while one of his old No19 Chelsea shirts was held up with ‘Judas’ written on the back.",
      "And after blocking Fernandez’s attempt to kick the ball back to United to take a throw-in, Mount went head to head with his former team-mate before pushing him away. After the full-time whistle, Fernandez could be seen beating his chest in front of the crestfallen Mount, rubbing salt into the wounds and delighting his supporters.",
      "“Enzo fighting Mount then later assisting Palmer right in front of Mount to score the winner is my highlight!” one Chelsea fan tweeted. Another simply added: “Enzo is proper Chels”.",
      "There was plenty of agreement that Fernandez embodies the club’s ethos. “Inject it. Proper Chels. Long may he stay,” one fan wrote. Another wrote: “I love Enzo! He has that proper Chels with charisma and doings!” Another concluded: “That win was for Enzo man”.",
      "Palmer’s last-minute strike sparked wild celebrations on the touchline from Mauricio Pochettino and his staff, with Fernandez knee-sliding in to join them. Moments like that have been in short supply this season and the Blues boss explained: “It was unfair [if Chelsea lost]. The feeling was not so good, because I thought why are we losing the game? But it happened because in football it is like this. In the end, I was keeping believing. We were talking to our players, 'there's still two minutes'. We believed we could score the winning goal.",
      "\"Yes, so happy because in the end it was emotional. Win the game like this, three points and for us it was a must-win game to reduce the gap to the teams ahead of us. It was so, so, so important, the three points today.\"",

      "That line was seemingly in reference to Chelsea's massive spending on recruitment. But Neville had the tables turned against him following Thursday's clash, with Carragher tweeting: \"The billion pound bottle jobs.\"",

      "\"In and out of possession, we made bad decisions. It's definitely a setback, but now we have to deal with this, to get up again and we will do. We are resilient. You have seen today how resilientwe are, how we returned in the game, the quality of our football.",

      "Phil Foden has gone on to shine for Manchester City after emerging from the club's academy - but the same can’t quite be said of some of his Premier League colleagues",
      "The term ‘wonderkid’ has been thrown about regularly since the Premier League’s inception in 1992.",
      "It’s only natural to get excited when a relatively-unknown name emerges from the academy to star in the top flight. Some have gone on to become the best players in the Premier League - with Wayne Rooney and Steven Gerrard among the star-studded names.",
      "However, there are others who didn't manage to reach the heights expected of them. Some have faded into obscurity, while others remain Premier League players to this day.",
      "And not all of them are veterans signed as squad players Take a look at nine examples of wonderkids still plying their trade in the top-flight..",
      "Chambers, now 29 years old, initially emerged onto the scene in 2012 with boyhood club Southampton. Arsenal immediately spotted his promise and secured his signature for £16m.",
      "He stayed in North London for seven-and-a-half years and had loan spells with Middlesbrough and Fulham. After 122 appearances for Arsenal, Chambers was sold to Aston Villa in 2022.",
      "He has made just 32 outings since, with his opportunities dwindling season upon season. The three-time England international made only his second Premier League appearance in Villa’s 4-1 defeat against Manchester City.",
      "From one former England international to another, Keane started his career as a promising talent at Manchester United. He made five appearances for the Red Devils, while also enjoying loan spells with Leicester, Derby and Blackburn.",
      "Keane quit Old Trafford in 2014 in a permanent move to Burnley and went on to become one of the most promising centre-backs in the country. After three years at Turf Moor, Keane was on the move again in 2017 with a £25m move to Everton.",
      "Keane, now 31, has made over 200 appearances for the Toffees but has made just four Premier League starts this term. His most recent league outing came in December.",
      "The third of a trio of centre-backs to have been on the fringes of the England squad, Holding first made his name with Bolton. Arsenal moved for the then 20-year-old’s signature for a bargain fee after just one campaign.",
      "Holding was a Gunner for seven years and twice won the FA Cup in North London. The defender brought his spell at Arsenal to a close at the start of the current campaign with a move to Crystal Palace.",
      "The move to Selhurst Park has not quite gone to plan, with Holding only making one appearance for the Eagles so far.",
      "A product of the West Ham academy, big things were expected of Burke following his emergence. The former England under-20 international struggled for football with the Hammers and had loan spells with Bradford, Wigan and Bolton.",
      "He eventually departed West Ham in the summer of 2018 with a switch to Championship side Hull City. Burke helped the Tigers to promotion from League One in his final season before a free transfer to Luton.",
      "Burke earned promotion back to the Premier League with the Hatters and has since made 15 appearances for the side as they attempt to stave off the threat of relegation.",
      "A one-time England international, Redmond is surprisingly just 30. He started his career with boyhood club Birmingham way back in 2010.",
      "He was soon snapped up by Norwich in 2013 and spent a total of three seasons at Carrow Road ahead of a move to the South Coast with Southampton. The winger was a Saint for seven seasons in all - going on to make 195 appearances for the club across a successful stint.",
      "Redmond left ahead of Southampton’s relegation from the Premier League to join Turkish side Besiktas. He was there for just one season before returning to England with Burnley.",
      "Somehow still just 28, Will Hughes has gone on to have a very solid Premier League career. The midfielder started his career with Derby where he went on to harness the reputation of one of the most promising players in the EFL.",
      "Watford swooped for his services in 2017 as they paid the Rams £8m. Hughes helped the Hornets stay in the Premier League for three seasons before they suffered from relegation.",
      "After helping Watford back to the top-flight, Hughes then moved to Crystal Palace - where he remains to this day.",
      "Okay, we’re kind of cheating here. Veteran goalkeeper Scott Carson has not played a Premier League game since the 2020/21 season and has not made an appearance of any kind in over two years.",
      "He still remains as part of Manchester City’s playing staff though. It is just the latest chapter in what is a storied career.",
      "Carson kicked off his career as a promising young goalkeeper with Leeds in 2003. The now 38-year-old went on to play for Liverpool, West Brom, Wigan, Derby and even Turkish side Bursaspor before moving to the Etihad.",
      "Staying at the Etihad, we’re at the other end of the spectrum for our latest offering. After starting his career with Bursaspor, forward Unal was snapped up by Manchester City in 2015 as a 17-year-old.",
      "He never made an appearance for City as he was regularly sent on loan to the Eredivisie before a move to Spain with Villarreal. Unal then found a home at Getafe.",
      "In a move that may have gone under the radar, the striker joined Bournemouth on loan in January and scored his first Premier League goal in a 2-2 draw with Sheffield United.",
      "Rounding off the list is a man who has not appeared in the Premier League since May 2022. Malang Sarr had harnessed the reputation as one of the most promising youngsters in Europe with Nice.",
      "Chelsea made a move for his services in 2020 and signed him on a five-year contract. Sarr was immediately sent out on loan to Porto and then returned to make 21 appearances in his second season as a Chelsea player.",
      "Opportunities soon dried up as he was sent to Monaco last term. He has not been seen since and was not even given a squad number for the current campaign. Sarr is still just 25 so still has time to salvage his career.",

      "Wayne Rooney was apparently left stunned by the lack of quality of both Nemanja Vidic and Patrice Evra when they signed for Manchester United in January 2006.",
      "Sir Alex Ferguson moved to add two defensive recruits mid-season and turned to Spartak Moscow and Monaco to conduct his recruitment. Both players were relatively unknown quantities when they arrived in Manchester - and did little to inspire early on.",
      "By this point Rooney was a leading light with the Red Devils having joined in 2004. The England international was among the most talent players in the squad and was less than impressed.",
      "Rio Ferdinand was an established member of the backline and Rooney came up to him to bemoan the quality of Vidic and Evra. He said on the Stick to Football podcast: “He [Nemanja Vidić] was an emotional man, wasn’t he? Really emotional guy. It was never too high, but he could always go too low, like bottom of the sea. A bad pass or bad performance at the early stage of his career was like a hangover for the rest of that week. He wouldn’t even talk to people. It took him a while to get through that.",
      "“You’ve got to remember; he came from the Russian league. He had that time to adapt. I remember Wazza [ Wayne Rooney ] in training and saying, ‘He is terrible. He can’t play for us.’ And the same about Patrice [Evra]. ‘Send these two back! How have we signed them?’\"",
      "Despite Rooney's initial fears he would be proved wrong by the pair as they went on to form part of a record-breaking defensive line. Evra was a stalwart on the flank with Vidic forming one of the all-time great partnerships alongside Ferdinand at centre-half.",
      "With the Serbian and the Englishman at the back United went on to win a hat-trick of Premier League titles as well as the Champions League in 2008. Ferdinand has reflected that both men bought huge amounts to the party as they complimented each other.",
      "“I think we [Rio Ferdinand and Nemanja Vidić] both needed each other,\" he said. \"Vida, I interviewed him a little while ago and he said, ‘Nemanja Vidić isn’t Nemanja Vidić without the relationship with Rio.’ And, I would say the same.",
      "“There are only some players, in attacking areas, where someone can go and do something on their own, but I needed him as much as he needed me. We had such different makeup as players as well. He was more aggressive, front foot, attack everything in the air, body on the line always.\"",

      "Back in December 2019 before Rees-Zammit’s first international cap for Wales, he posted an image of himself playing for Gloucester. Scholes attempted to convert the winger to Six Nations rivals England, commenting: “The England debut can't be far off now!!!”",
      "Rees-Zammit was actually eligible to play for England, despite being born and raised in Wales, as he attended Hartpury College in Gloucestershire. While he could have made the switch on residency grounds, Rees-Zammit shut down any chance of that happening by replying: “Wales*”",
      "The 23-year-old addressed his relationship with Scholes in an interview with the BBC. He said: “I used to date his daughter so it was a running joke. He always used to try to make me play for England but I wasn't having any of it.”",
      "Rees-Zammit dated Scholes’ daughter Alicia, who is a professional netball player and has spent the last two seasons playing for London Pulse. But the pair are no longer together as Rees-Zammit ventures to the United States to pursue his NFL dream.",
      "Last week, Rees-Zammit put pen to paper on a three-year deal with the Chiefs, officially sealing his future in the NFL. His contract with the Kansas City Chiefs includes some guaranteed money as well as a signing bonus as he joins as part of the NFL’s International Player Pathway program.",

The IPP aims to help premier athletes earn a spot on one of the 32 rosters and increase the number of international players in the NFL via an intense 10-week training programme.",
      "Blessed with remarkable speed, Rees-Zammit developed into one of the most exciting wingers in the game; he scored five tries at the 2023 Rugby World Cup in France as The Dragons reached the quarter-finals. After completing 10 weeks at IMG Academy in Florida, Rees-Zammit impressed at a Pro Day before enjoying team visits, meeting with the Cleveland Browns and New York Jets before agreeing to terms with the Chiefs.",
      "Rees-Zammit has always harboured hopes of playing in the NFL. Speaking on the NFL UK YouTube series ‘The Pathway’, he said: “I think the first thought of being in the NFL was when I was a young boy, but I knew I had to play rugby for a long time before that. I’ve played for Gloucester since I was 16 years old - without them, I wouldn’t have done anything in rugby.",
      "“I’ve played for my country, I’ve gone to a World Cup, I’ve played for The Lions. I’m very grateful for that and just allowing me this opportunity to come to the IPP programe and try to live my dream.”"

      "CHELSEA 4-3 MANCHESTER UNITED: Cole Palmer scored twice in the final moments of stoppage time as his winning strike - and hat-trick goal - downed the Red Devils",
      "Cole Palmer continues to be Chelsea's go to man as he scored twice in stoppage time to seal a 4-3 victory over Manchester United with the latest winning goal in Premier League history.",
      "Chelsea looked to have squandered a 2-0 lead when Alejandro Garnacho scored on 65 minutes to put the Red Devils 3-2 up. Palmer though came up with his first career hat-trick, scoring a deflected winner as the clocked ticked over to 100 minutes. Seconds earlier he'd bagged an equaliser from the spot.",
      "Garnacho thought he'd produced another big moment as his second-half header sealed a sensational United comeback - only for Palmer to take centre stage. Conor Gallagher got a frantic first-half underway when he hammered home early on. Antony then tripped Marc Cucurella to present Palmer with the chance to double the host's lead. The playmaker has been prolific from the spot and was on cue to make it 2-0.",
      "Two goals in the space of five minutes turned the contest though - and lit the United flame. Moises Caicedo's slack pass presented Garnacho with the chance to land a lifeline and he finished smartly. Bruno Fernandes' well-timed run then allowed him to get onto the end of a cross and head past Dorde Petrovic to level the game.",
      "United's lack of draws this term - the least of any team in the league - meant a fifth goal was on the cards either way. It came courtesy of the young Argentine, who continues to grow in stature, as he converted a stunning Antony cross to put United in front of the travelling fans.",
      "It looked to be the winner until, in the seventh minute of added time, Chelsea were gifted a second penalty of the evening. Palmer hammered home late on to thwart Manchester City in west London - and he did so against United to rescue a point. He wasn't done there though as his strike deflected off Scott McTominay to send Stamford Bridge into raptures.",
      "Here's the lowdown from west London.",
      "The mood in west London going into stoppage time - and at the end - could not have had a greater contrast. Chelsea's poor season looked to have sunk to a new low as they let a comfortable lead slip with United closing in on another memorable comeback.",
      "Pressure would've ramped up further on Mauricio Pochettino and Palmer's equalising penalty looked to have kept the doubters quiet for at least a few days. His hat-trick goal though capped an incredible few moments with the character of the side earning some rare plaudits.",
      "Once upon a time we'd be talking about the ramifications of this contest impacting the title race. Instead Chelsea knew that three points would lift them into the top half whilst United needed the win to keep alive their hopes of landing fifth spot and Champions League qualification.",
      "It is proof of how both sides have fallen - Chelsea more so than their opponents. Pochettino's side continue to show shoots of promise, only to be dealt reality checks on a regular basis. United meanwhile blow hot and cold - as they proved in the first-half alone.",
      "He's a Manchester City product and those in the away end at Stamford Bridge wanted to remind the playmaker that he had to leave the Etihad to further his career. He was called a \"City reject\" as he wandered over to take a corner - but quietened the fans in the best possible way.",
      "Palmer, who was the standout individual throughout the contest, cooly slotted a first-half penalty to make it 2-0 and gestured to the United fans with their chants doing little to influence the Chelsea star. He had the last laugh as the clocked ticked into the 99th minutes as he scored a second penalty of the evening to level late on.",
      "He's an academy graduate, he's a regular in midfield and he's the club captain. Yet Gallagher's future in west London is far from secure with clubs circling as his contract winds down. There seems to have been no productive conversations between the player and the hierarchy.",
      "Some may speculate that Gallagher, alongside two £100million midfielders, is not a fashionable name. Chelsea's owners have shown themselves to get few of their footballing decisions right and few would be surprised to see Gallagher moved on. Yet, despite the outside noise, the man donning the armband continues to battle on, scoring the opener early on to get the night off in the best possible way.",
      "It has been a year to forget and, after another underwhelming display at Brentford, Rashford was resigned to a spot on the bench at Stamford Bridge. Antony was bought in to replace him with Ten Hag citing rotation as the reason to leave out the forward.",
      "Rotation... that's all whilst remembering Bruno Fernandes has started 29 league games this season. Tweaking his line-up was perhaps a convenient reason for leaving Rashford out as he continues to struggle for goals and overall impact. He was introduced as a second-half sub.",

      "Where would Chelsea be without Cole Palmer?",
      "Thankfully for fans at Stamford Bridge, they haven’t had to find out.",
      "The England international arrived for £42million from Manchester City in August because he wanted to play regularly, and he has been the side’s shining light so far this season. There’s no real need for Chelsea to have an end of season awards, because the 21-year-old is going to sweep the board.",
      "But when Manchester United came to west London on Thursday night, supporters of the Red Devils were keen to focus on Palmer’s past, and that association with City that he ended - too abruptly for some at the Etihad - at the start of the season. Palmer’s first touches were greeted with jeers from the away support, with chants of “City reject” piercing the night sky early on.",
      "They had died down somewhat after Conor Gallagher's early goal had put Chelsea ahead. And when Antony fouled Marc Cucurella to hand Chelsea a penalty and the chance to double their advantage, you could forgive those United fans in attendance for regretting their earlier choice.",
      "Because there stood Palmer, ball in hand, over the penalty spot. There he was, calmly putting the ball on the spot, having scored every single penalty he’s taken for the Blues since his move. And there he was, calmly rolling into the bottom corner, sending Andre Onana the wrong way, and doubling the hosts advantage.",
      "Palmer has lived up to his ‘Cold’ nickname this term and has made shivering his celebration. After the taunts from United’s travelling contingent, he made a little change, cupping his hand to his ear as if to ask ‘where have your chants gone?’.",
      "It was Palmer's 17th goal of an extremely productive season and had Mauricio Pochettino's men firmly in the ascendency after a stellar opening.",
      "However, two quickfire goals in the space of five first-half minutes, had the United support finding their voice again as Alejandro Garnacho and Bruno Fernandes both struck to level the scored before the break.",
      "Garnacho fired United in front in the second half and they looked like winners - until Palmer fired home a 99th minute equaliser with his second penalty of the night.",
      "Nor was that the end of the scoring, as Palmer's smashed home a 101st minute deflected winner, to have the last laugh.",

      "Gary Neville, Rio Ferdinand and Roy Keane gave their opinions on Marcus Rashford as the Manchester United and England star continues to endure a difficult season",
      "Marcus Rashford's brother slammed Gary Neville and accused the Manchester United legend of fuelling \"clickbait\" stories about the struggling star.",
      "Neville admitted on the Stick to Football podcast that he was genuinely \"worried\" for Rashford and claimed the England international \"doesn't look happy.\" Ex-United defender Rio Ferdinand then suggested that Rashford, 26, could benefit from leaving his home city of Manchester or distancing himself from certain people in his personal life in order to rediscover his best form.",
      "Fellow United legend Roy Keane added that Rashford might benefit from \"an old-fashioned kick up the a***,\" but questioned whether anyone inside the Old Trafford dressing room or any members of their coaching staff are capable of doing so.",
      "In response, the 26-year-old's brother and agent, Dwaine Maynard, took to Instagram told the pundits to \"pick up the phone\" rather than making their opinions public.",
      "\"I completely understand podcasts and how they work but if you have genuine concerns, pick up the phone,\" Maynard posted hours before Rashford was dropped to the bench for United's Premier League clash with Chelsea on Thursday.",
      "\"We know each other or have crossed paths. Airing so-called concerns for the public to have an opinion is bad mind and for clickbait in my eyes. The fun fact is that most of these shows or ex-pros have asked for exclusives.\"",
      "His post comes just weeks after Rashford's mum, Melanie Maynard, warned the United forward to be wary of negative influences around him who are \"wolves dressed in sheep's clothing.\" Writing for the Times, she said: \"Marcus is human, so he will have ups and downs in his life like everyone else. Marcus is in a very good place, he will never let anyone down.\"",
      "Neville's concerns made headlines when the podcast was uploaded that morning, with the former United captain admitting: \"Marcus Rashford, I don't know how to say this, but to me there's something not right. He's not right, and it's not just a case of him not playing well, he doesn't look happy.",
      "Your turn! Were the legends' comments about Marcus Rashford fair? Give us your verdict in the comments section.",
      "\"I'm looking at him and thinking, I am worried about him. We know there's been a couple of instances this season, he's come under pressure and his form has been bad, but I look at him and think that's not right. It's not a lad that's grown up with the freedom and spirit of playing for Manchester United as a kid.\"",
      "Ferdinand gave his verdict by saying: \"From him, he's got to look at who is around him. I know his family play a big part with him, which is great, but who are the external people around that? Are they the right people, are they enabling him to make excuses for himself behind closed doors, or are they saying, 'Look at yourself, and be accountable for what you are doing'?\"",
      "Keane also offered his opinion in typical no-nonsense fashion, claiming: \"There's no question mark about his ability, he's outstanding - but there's something amiss with him. We've had these conversations every few months - a player can have an off-spell or a dip, but he's certainly not enjoying his football.",
      "\"I wouldn't say I'm worried about him, but you look at him and there's something amiss. The people around him, whether it be family or his manager, who’s on his case every day. Who is giving him an old-fashioned kick up the arse and saying, 'Come on, we need more from you'. If you want to be this leader, and you're on the big contracts, then there is that responsibility.",
      "\"I don't think that is happening, I don't think there is anybody on his case. That doesn't mean to say he still can't produce and start running a bit more. He's been at the club a long time, since he was a kid.\"",

      "Nathan Aspinall has recalled the first time he realised Luke Littler would become a darts sensation - after arguing with the phenom's dad.",
      "Aspinall, who is currently ranked fourth in the world, recognised early on that fellow Manchester United fan Littler was set to become a teenage sensation in darts.",
      "Littler made waves in the sport by reaching the World Championship final at just 16. Despite losing in the final to Luke Humphries, his incredible journey captured the nation's attention as people marvelled at how someone so young could perform at such a high level.",
      "And Littler's success has brought millions of new viewers to darts. The Worlds final was watched by a whopping 4.8 million viewers on Sky Sports, making it the most-watched non-football event in the broadcaster's history.",
      "LISTEN: Exclusive Nathan Aspinall chat.",
      "Since his appearance at the Worlds, Littler has turned 17, been invited to Old Trafford and Carrington, and continued to win darts matches. In an exclusive chat with the MEN's Manchester is Red podcast, Aspinall, who shares the same management team, talked about Littler's rapid rise to fame.",
      "\"The first time I came across Luke, I think it was in Chester in a tournament and I beat him 4-3,\" he said. \"I think he was aged four! No, he was around 12 and wow, I just thought 'who is the kid? '.",
      "\"I remember seeing his dad with him and he was dead critical of him because he'd lost. I was thinking mate, he's 12, and I was in the top 16 in the world at that time and I said 'give him a break'.",
      "\"His dad said 'no, he needs to learn' and that hard talk over the years has probably produced one of the best players in our sport. He's amazing and what else can you say?",
      "Where will Luke Littler finish in the Premier League? Share your predictions in the comments below",
      "\"We're all [darts players] sick of seeing his face on social media and that's a credit to him, it's not just the media who are obsessed with him, he's bringing them to him.",
      "\"He had an amazing run at the Worlds, then hit a nine-darter against me in Bahrain, then he won a tournament, then he won the first Pro Tour and Euro Tour, so that's full credit to him.\"",
      "\"I beat him recently and that was the first time since he's been professional. Obviously, we've practised together in the past and generally I would get the better of him, but since the Worlds, he's a completely different animal.",
      "\"I needed that for myself because I couldn't lose three on the bounce to him.\"",

      "Joshua Zirkzee is understood to prefer a move to AC Milan, despite Manchester United and Arsenal both being linked with a move for the highly-rated Bologna forward",
      "Manchester United and Arsenal target Joshua Zirkzee is understood to prefer a move to AC Milan and has told his agents to pave the way for his dream transfer.",
      "The 22-year-old has impressed for Bologna this season with 10 goals and four assists in 28 matches, helping Bologna to fourth in Serie A and on track to qualify for the Champions League. However, the Dutchman is expected to move on and leave the club this summer, despite signing from Bayern Munich less than two years ago.",
      "There is no shortage of interested parties for his signature with United, Arsenal and Juventus among the clubs linked with the talented forward. But according to Gazzetta dello Sport, Zirkzee's preference is Milan and he has instructed his representatives to figure out the proposed move.",
      "The same report adds that Milan are preparing an offer which should be able to convince Bologna to sell their prized asset. It's said that the Rossoneri are considering a bid in the region of £42.9million and the full ownership of Alexis Saelemaekers, who has shone while on loan at Bologna this season.",
      "Considering United paid £64m for Rasmus Hojlund from Atalanta, Bologna feel that Zirkzee is worth a similar amount. The Italian club also need to make as much profit from the £7.3m spent on the striker, as Bayern have a 40 per cent sell-on fee clause installed in his contract which he signed in August 2022.",
      "It would be a blow for United and Arsenal if Zirkzee does move to Milan, given the potential and current ability he has. The former Anderlecht loanee stands at 6\"4 and is an excellent target man, though he does prefer to have another forward alongside him to make a dynamic and interchangeable front-two.",
      "Speaking about his style, Zirkzee told Corriere della Sera in February: \"I'm not a pure centre forward. I said a year ago that I liked playing with an attacking partner. But [Thiago] Motta transformed me into a 9 and a half. I'm not an [Marko] Arnautovic type, I like to come forward after playing the ball and help the team. And score goals.\"",
      "\"If you play on the street you often do it against older guys,\" he continued. \"You have to find a way to protect yourself, develop more skills, you have to be faster, stronger, have better technique.",
      "\"You want to impress the big guys, earn their respect, show them who’s the best. And when you enter a real training centre, certain things stay with you and make the difference.\"",

      "\"And we didn't make the right decisions, we didn't react quick enough to avoid this situation.",
      "\"I said today to the players, on decision-making, we have to make better decisions, it's our strength. You saw again how we score from counters - we can be such a massive threat. And we have seen today an example with tempo, how we can beat our opponents, where we are unstoppable.",
      "\"But we have to read when to keep the ball, especially when you are winning. Keep the ball, pass and move and switch the play instead of giving the ball away or going only into long balls. Bring the ball into the opponent's half, keep passing, discourage the opponent.",
      "\"But then if you have to defend you have to do it proper and we made the wrong decisions. And on individual errors and that's very frustrating if you're playing a good game.\"",

      "There had been 26 goals in the 80th minute and onwards in United's 90-minute matches this season. Make that 28 now. The latest two both went to Chelsea and Cole Palmer.",
      "Palmer was heckled with \"City reject\" by the United fans. If only the Wythenshawe-born boyhood Red had rejected City. It is unforgivable that United let him slip through the net. Palmer has joined the elite few who have scored a hat-trick against them.",
      "Also unforgivable is United's knack for conceding late goals and conceding in quick succession. After a 99th-minute equaliser went past Andre Onana at Brentford, there were goals in the 110th and 111th.",
      "Mauricio Pochettino and his staff charged onto the pitch. Erik ten Hag skulked down the tunnel without shaking hands. If there was any doubt, there can be no more. This United squad does not have the mentality to qualify for the Champions League.",
      "Even in one of United's finer performances of a chaotic campaign, this was ultimately evidence to file in the 'Ten Hag out' dossier. United sieved goals of a familiar variety and they were killed off at the death again. Antony appeared close to tears at the final shrill.",
      "Magnificently backed by the deafening din from the away section of the Shed End, United performed at a level that suggested there was a \"process\" Ten Hag referred to during his pre-match press conference on Wednesday. But this was one of their most galling results.",
      "United have a knack for 3-2 wins from 2-0 down and this seemed to be another. Elements of their performance were encouraging even when Chelsea were leading at 2-0 and they were not for nothing. United brimmed with silk and steel as they coped with more defensive casualties and introduced 19-year-old Willy Kambwala for a thorough examination.",
      "Ten Hag has stretched it at times by lamenting United's lucklessness and they were cut a thick slice by Moises Caicedo. Come added time, United were \"Ole\"ing. Palmer was reduced to hatchet man tactics on Dalot. Harry Maguire told Dalot to \"stay down\". Instead, he brought Madueke down.",
      "How the exhibition fare must have motivated Palmer. Even in a season laden with finales that defied belief, this was the most unbelievable involving United. Arsenal, Fulham and Chelsea have beaten them via stoppage-time goals.",
      "It will be of little consolation to Ten Hag that United's followers saw the best of them throughout the night. Casemiro held Ten Hag in a clinch after Alejandro Garnacho stopped short of crowd surfing in the away end. Maguire professionally eschewed the celebrations for a touchline conflab.",
      "Garnacho urged the United supporters to extol Antony. This was the Brazilian's best performance yet in a United shirt and his recall was instrumental. Little wonder he was crestfallen at the conclusion.",
      "It is far too premature to herald this as a changing of the guard but Ten Hag must privately savour Antony's impact in the absence of the dropped Marcus Rashford. Ten Hag claimed Rashford's demotion was rotational but his name is bound to be among the substitutes against Liverpool again on Sunday.",
      "For Knightsbridge resident and one-time Chelsea season-ticket holder Sir Jim Ratcliffe, this was as much of a home game as at Old Trafford. He was accompanied by Old Trafford task-forcer and Chelsea supporter Sebastian Coe, which would have made for lively conversation in the directors' lounge.",
      "Palmer, a left-footed right-sided forward on United's doorstep, was gifted a second goal against them by the right winger United invested €100million in. This proved to be one of Antony's finest nights in the red shirt and his gusto drew ripples of applause more than once from the away section. The exceptional Palmer had the last word.",
      "Ten Hag moaned at Aaron Wan-Bissaka, back at right back, for losing an aerial duel with Mykhailo Mudryk and soon the problems were on the other side. Dalot beckoned Garnacho to track back and soon United were conceding from another pull-back. Conor Gallagher's shot was another saveable conceded by Andre Onana.",
      "The quiet Wan-Bissaka and Antony are an odd couple yet they have shown greater promise as a pairing than Portuguese speakers Dalot and Antony. The communication between the left-sided Latinos was awry for Conor Gallagher's opening goal. United had three monitors installed in their dugout and the repeats would have made for uncomfortable viewing from every angle.",
      "United coach Steve McClaren offered Wan-Bissaka some tidbits after Axel Disasi lost him for a corner. Wan-Bissaka was not entirely responsive and McClaren soon consulted one of the United analysts.",
      "Disasi's wayward header at 2-0 was pivotal. Caicedo unwittingly assisted Garnacho and soon United were as dominant as their ardent followers in the Shed End. Bruno Fernandes finished a brilliant team goal started by Onana and Chelsea's 2-0 lead was extinguished within five minutes.",
      "Wan-Bissaka and Antony's unlikely alliance resumed and the latter, impressive in the reverse fixture in December, vindicated his recall despite naively conceding a penalty by fouling Marc Cucurella. The Brazilian salvaged a lost cause prior to Caicedo's error and switched the play expertly for Dalot to assist Fernandes.",
      "Pochettino, once destined to manage United, could not bear to watch when he realised the recipient of Caicedo's pass did not wear blue. Ten Hag briefly looked condemned in the technical area and soon the unpopular Pochettino appeared strained. The two bickered over the referee's refusal to book Maguire for an apparently deliberate foul.",
      "United's first-half momentum was almost halted at the death again by Gallagher, who struck the post at 2-2. Maguire implored the United bench to substitute the struggling Raphael Varane as Jonny Evans paced up and down the touchline. Evans's arrival was delayed until the second half and Varane made way at the pause for the second match running, inviting more scrutiny on the United manager and medical staff. Evans was forced off after 20 minutes.",
      "Rashford cut a disconsolate figure as United waited for their train at Stockport Station on Thursday morning. It was reminiscent of his detached body language at the same station five months earlier. He was not selected to start at Fulham, either, having purportedly failed a fitness test. Here, he was on the bench.",
      "His demotion was compounded by Gary Neville \"worrying\" about Rashford on his podcast. That drew scorn from Rashford's brother, Dwaine Maynard, via an Instagram Story post that reminded Neville of his exclusive with the United forward in the summer.",
      "Ten Hag claimed Rashford was benched \"for rotation to keep him and the team fresh through a busy period with another big game on Sunday\". Rashford played 15 minutes for England against Brazil, was unused against Belgium and substituted 80 minutes into United's draw with Brentford.",
      "Garnacho lined up for the 28th consecutive United game and scored twice in an otherwise predicted line-up. Ten Hag's rationale did not wash. United are treading on eggshells with Rashford when Roy Keane had prescribed a \"kick up the a--e\". Ten Hag offered him a pat on the back when he sent him on.",
      "He gave Garnacho similar treatment after seemingly completing the comeback. Only there was a twist.",

      "The main talking points and highlights as Man Utd lost 4-3 against Chelsea away from home in the Premier League.",
      "Ten Hag's gesture to supporters",
      "Erik ten Hag approached the away section and applauded Manchester United fans around an hour before kick-off. They responded with generous applause and appreciated his gesture.",
      "Ten Hag still has the backing of a portion of matchgoing fans, who are reluctant to see another United manager bite the dust, and a 3-2 victory over Chelsea would have been the perfect tonic after a disappointing performance against Brentford, who deserved to win last weekend.",
      "The game threatened to turn ugly after Chelsea took a 2-0 lead within just 20 minutes, but United fought their way back into the game and showed impressive resilience.",
      "If the dressing room weren't playing for their manager they would have collapsed after those goals, and United did brilliantly to turn the game around after early setbacks.",
      "Ten Hag should have been delighted when the final whistle blew - he was dumbfounded and searching for answers instead. Diogo Dalot conceded a penalty deep into injury time and United conceded again, with Cole Palmer finding the back of the net to make it 4-3.",
      "Ten Hag has been under immense pressure over the last few months and the noise is only going to get louder. He looked seething when making a quick exit from the touchline.",
      "Antony takes his chance",
      "Antony had his best match for United since signing from Ajax in Ten Hag's first summer in charge. He looked bright from the start and was the most likely to create something.",
      "He played a part in all three goals, doing exceptionally well to keep the move alive for the first, picking the right pass to Dalot for the second and assisting the third.",
      "There's no denying Antony has been an awful signing considering he was signed for £86million, however, Thursday night suggested he could still have a future at the club. He was the standout performer for United and vindicated the call to start him on the right.",
      "Wan-Bissaka's position",
      "Although it was a surprise to see Aaron Wan-Bissaka start at left-back in the 2-2 draw with Tottenham at Old Trafford in January, he vindicated that decision with a strong performance.",
      "He started in that role again upon his return from injury against Liverpool in the FA Cup and delivered another excellent performance, despite coming back from a lay-off.",
      "Dalot has been in fine form this term and the logic behind starting Wan-Bissaka on that side is to allow the Portuguese international to play in his preferred position.",
      "However, Wan-Bissaka markedly regressed when starting at left-back against Brentford. He was targeted and was responsible for playing Thomas Frank's team onside for their equaliser.",
      "It was the correct decision to relocate him to right-back at Stamford Bridge, although that didn't matter by full-time. United must stop conceding in quick succession and the whole team, not just the defensive line, must take responsibility. Champions League qualification is unlikely.",
      "Ten Hag sends message to Rashford",
      "The word before the game was that Ten Hag had decided to drop Marcus Rashford, which was confirmed when the teams were announced.",
      "Rashford had started 24 games from a possible 29 before Thursday night, but he was poor against Brentford and his body language, which has been a concern all season, was scrutinised again, so there were no complaints to see him moved to the bench at Stamford Bridge.",
      "The bottom line is that Rashford's performances haven't been good enough. His form picked up at the beginning of 2024 but he's still far from the levels he was operating at last season.",
      "Rashford scored 30 goals in 2022/23 and he's scored just eight in this campaign and, although he's not the only player guilty of underperforming, his drop-off has been stark.",
      "Palmer feels like a United player",
      "A photo of Palmer wearing a 2010/11 United shirt recently went viral on social media and it was revealed he grew up supporting the club, idolising Wayne Rooney.",
      "\"What a player. When I was growing up I used to watch all the football and the one that sticks in my mind is Rooney. Ever since I was a little kid he has been my hero,\" said Palmer in November.",
      "Chelsea's scattergun transfer policy has been a disaster since Todd Boehly's takeover, but the £40million spent to sign Palmer from Manchester City has proved to be a bargain.",
      "Palmer has been involved in 22 Premier League goals for Chelsea this season, scoring 14 and assisting eight, and he feels the kind of player United should be looking to sign. The 21-year-old has the personality and quality to play for United and it would be great to see him play for the club he supported when was a boy sometime in the future.",
      "Although it's worth noting the away section serenaded him with \"City reject, woah, City reject\" when he took a corner. Palmer responded by scoring a hat-trick.",

      "His reaction shows how dismayed he was at how the match was thrown away by his side. This is a manager under pressure for not being able to correct the mistakes that have cost his team so dearly this season.",
      "Harry Maguire urged Diogo Dalot to “stay down” when he was on the floor to try and eat up the minutes in added time. While this gamesmanship in itself can be debated, the overall notion about a lack of game management from United can be pulled upon.",
      "United saw experienced heads Casemiro, Raphael Varane and Jonny Evans all withdrawn before the end and the lack of a stable character cost them in the end.",
      "Willy Kambwala came on for his seventh career appearance after substitute Evans had to go off 20 minutes into the second half. The 19-year-old put in a sturdy performance and made a series of good blocks and clearances.",
      "In the 82nd minute, the centre-back diverted a low cross behind for a corner and gestured with his hands to the home fans to calm down. He can hold his head up high for his personal display but the final 19 minutes is a lesson on staying focused on the game until the final whistle.",

      "He responded with a laudable display against Chelsea when they visited Old Trafford in the following game and he started against Mauricio Pochettino's side again on Thursday.",

      "Ajax probably couldn't believe their luck when United agreed to sign Antony in a deal worth £86million and, understandably, supporters have seemed to have given up on him.",
      "But at Stamford Bridge under the floodlights, there were signs of a player who could yet still have a future in Manchester, despite having made an awful start at the club.",
      "Antony looked the most likely to create something from the first whistle and he was cutting inside with purpose, which was giving Marc Cucurella a headache.",
      "There was also an urgency about his game that is usually absent. He was notably quick off the mark and a Dutch former Premier League player in the press box suggested that Antony had pace in abundance, so they clearly haven't watched his every appearance in England.",
      "Antony has looked incapable of beating the opposition full-back since his arrival from Ajax, but he looked bright against Chelsea and grew in confidence throughout the game.",
      "The only blemish on his performance was his foul on Cucurella in the first half. Antony was never going to win the ball from that angle and he naively conceded the penalty with a clumsy challenge, which Cole Palmer converted to give his side a comfortable 2-0 lead after 20 minutes.",
      "Although the game threatened to turn ugly, United were gifted a goal from Moises Caicedo's mistake and Antony's contribution in the build-up didn't go unnoticed.",
      "He did brilliantly to keep the move alive by the touchline and also played a part in the equalising goal, picking the right pass to Diogo Dalot, who was waiting on the left.",
      "There was even a moment in the second half when Antony burst down the channel, beating Cucurella with feet like a ballroom dancer, only to be denied a goal by inches.",
      "You'd have been forgiven for thinking an imposter was wearing Antony's shirt and his assist for Garnacho's second goal, to make the game 3-2, was outstanding.",
      "Ten Hag pushed hard to sign Antony in his first summer in charge and for most of the time he's spent at the club, his manager's faith in him has been questionable and baffling.",
      "It was a brave decision to start Antony against Chelsea and his performance emphatically vindicated the call. It was perhaps the night that he finally arrived in a red shirt.",
      "Antony has a distance to go to be considered a successful signing, but there were encouraging signs against Chelsea that suggested he could turn it around.",
      "There are just under two months remaining of the season and Antony must use his performance in West London to propel him forward - it must be his turning point.",
      "He's been written off by most, but Thursday night was a step in the right direction. It's just a shame it counted for nothing after an inexplicable late collapse.",

      "Returning to the top four will of course be the aim for 2024/25, and, whoever the manager is, could be backed in the transfer window to try and reach that goal. But any signings made will need to prove that they are robust in terms of being able to play most games in the season - just as Bruno Fernandes is.",
      "That has not been the case the general case with signings made so far under Ten Hag. Of the 12 signings made over the last two seasons, 10 have suffered with some sort of injury issues since arriving at Old Trafford.",
      "United have injury doubts over six players currently, with two more players looking set to return from injury for the clash against Chelsea. Players not being available for selection, especially when the club have paid a lot of money for them is less than ideal for both Ten Hag and the club.",

      "It’s the same story for those players brought in from last summer. Casemiro, Martinez, Malacia and Christian Eriksen have all struggled with injuries at some point during their time at Old Trafford. In that case Antony is the only signing that has been able to play the majority of games without any injury problems, although he was made unavailable for a period at the start of the season.",
      "The issue points to how United need to use Fernandes as a framework when targeting players in the summer. The captain has not missed many games through injury since signing from Sporting CP in January 2020, he was the same for his former club.",
      "While the quality a player brings to the team is important in any new signing, if he can only play half of the games due to injury, then that’s not something that United should pursue. The club needs players they can turn to in the most important parts of the season, and bringing in a player who will be expected to play every game could be key. It may just be the difference between a top-four finish or not at the end of the campaign.",

However, what they haven’t had is any kind of football strategy, played out in a stadium that has been allowed to decline, almost as if representative of the way that the club has been run under the Glazers.",
      "Whether or not United choose to redevelop Old Trafford or build a new stadium on the land adjacent will be cause for discussion for some time yet, but for Ratcliffe part of the plan to return the club, which hasn’t won a Premier League title since 2013, to the summit of the English game has already started.",
      "The landscape is different now, however. It is no longer a case of who can spend the most; it is about who can be smarter with what they have and how they use it.",
      "The Premier League’s Profit and Sustainability Rules (PSR) have come into sharp focus over the past 12 months, with Everton (twice), Nottingham Forest, and Leicester City all landed with charges for being in breach of PSR, which limits clubs to £105m worth of losses over a three-year period, with deductions allowed for such things as infrastructure investment, academy, the women’s game, and community initiatives.",
      "But even though the charges thus far have been levelled at clubs outside the so-called ‘Big Six’, the ever-increasing cost of being competitive through bumper transfer fees and wage bills meant that even the likes of United and Arsenal had to be mindful when January came in order to remain compliant.",
      "United’s huge revenue streams have continued to grow over the years despite a lack of success, with the club remaining a commercial juggernaut. For the 2022/23 financial year the club saw an 11% rise in revenue, from £583m to £648m, with pre-tax losses reduced from £150m to £33m.",
      "Part of the Ratcliffe plan at United is to address sizeable club costs and work smarter, and his desire to make these changes arrives at a time when Premier League clubs are likely to vote around a new set of financial controls - potentially in time for next season - that will replace PSR, a model that is now deemed unfit for purpose. It is likely that the Premier League adopt a model in line with what UEFA already has, which is a squad cost ratio.",
      "Sign up to our new weekly newsletter, the Bottom Line, which will bring you exclusive reporting on the financial issues affecting the future of football.",
      "From the happenings at the biggest clubs, at home and abroad, interviews with the people who make the big decisions behind the scenes - Dave Powell, Chief Business of Football Writer for Reach Plc, will be keeping newsletter subscribers informed and doing deep dives into the business of Premier League clubs, the EFL pyramid, US sports and more.",
      "The Bottom Line is currently offering 50% off annual subscriptions.",
      "So, for the latest news on the finances of Premier League clubs from Dave Powell, subscribe here.",
      "UEFA’s current model works towards a 70% squad cost ratio limit, with the calculations made by taking wages, plus amortisation costs (the way transfer fees are accounted for), severance costs, and intermediary fees, and offsetting them against operating revenue and player trading profit (the best year of the last three to take into account the volatility of the transfer market).",
      "Nothing concrete has yet been presented, although various reports have suggested that the Premier League may impose a 70% threshold on clubs in regular European competition, with those outside of that revenue stream allowed an 85% squad cost ratio.",
      "But what might the adoption of squad cost ratio by the Premier League look like for United?",
      "Using the 2022/23 financials, United’s wage bill stood at £331m after wage drops resulting from a lack of Champions League qualification kicked in. When assessing squad cost ratio, UEFA uses relevant wages, which are the wages attributed to playing staff and the head coach. According to figures presented by football finance expert Swiss Ramble, the relevant wage for United for squad cost ratio assessment purposes was £282m.",
      "Then comes amortisation costs. Amortisation is the guaranteed sum of a transfer fee to acquire a player divided by the years of the contract. Regardless of the payment schedule for the transfer, it is how transfers are accounted for by football clubs. For United, this amortisation figure stood at £170m for 2022/23, with that figure being the remaining book value of players.",
      "Adding together the £282m in relevant wages, and the £170m in amortised costs, acknowledging that the club had no severance payments to make for the sacking of managers during the financial year in question, gives a sum of £452m. Now, that £452m is then assessed against operating revenue and player trading performance.",
      "United’s revenue growth to £648m, allied with reduction in payroll, helps the squad cost ratio considerably. In terms of player trading, a sum of £21m has been achieved by United. The player trading profit is the profit that clubs have made on the sale of a player over and above their remaining book value.",
      "Adding together the operating revenue and player trading profit delivers a figure of £669m, with additional relevant income from player trading, such as loan fees, bringing in another £1m-plus to take the sum to around £671m. That £671m, against wage costs, amortisation costs, severance and intermediary fees, would see United at a 67% squad cost ratio; the fifth best in the Premier League, ahead of Liverpool (68%) and Arsenal (74%), but trailing Manchester City’s 60%.",
      "That gives United a 3% head-start on being compliant with any new regulation. But with wages likely to increase when Champions League qualification does, and the requirement to keep adding in the transfer market, there is an obvious reason why Ratcliffe wants to get a firmer grip on costs now.",
      "United have the benefit of being a part of the 'Big Six', where revenues far outstrip the rest thanks to regular European competition and increasing commercial revenues through the global stature of the brand. The greater headroom that can be created ahead of new regulation through stricter cost control and spending money in the transfer market more wisely, the greater freedom United will have to act appropriately in the market when the time is right.",

      "The Premier League are reportedly considering a change to how breaches of Profitability and Sustainability Rules are punished, among a number of potential rule changes being discussed",
      "Premier League clubs, including at Manchester United, are 'considering' making a change to how breaches of Profitability and Sustainability Rules (PSR) are punished, according to reports.",
      "Both Everton and Nottingham Forest have been handed points deductions by independent commissions after being found guilty of breaching the allowed limit of losses over three years, while Leicester City have also been charged with an alleged breach and face a hearing in front of an independent commission, despite their relegation last season.",
      "Everton have been deducted six points, cut from an initial 10 on appeal, while Forest were handed a four-point deduction. Leicester could face a possible points deduction at the start of next season if they earn promotion back to the Premier League.",
      "It is an outcome which many officials are reported to be unhappy with. Concerns among club owners, as reported by the Daily Mail, are that under its current guise, PSR will see the Premier League fall from its lucrative position as the world's best league because it will no longer be able to afford the best players on the best salaries.",
      "United's derby rivals, Manchester City, are still dealing with 115 charges. Among them, there are accusations of not co-operating with the Premier League investigation, not abiding by PSR regulations, and not giving truthful and accurate information about their finances.",
      "According to the Daily Mail, Premier League clubs are now considering replacing the points deduction punishment with a 'luxury tax'. It's reported that this 'radical reform' could be voted in at the end-of-season meeting in June, with up to 17 clubs believed to be in favour.",
      "One idea being considered is to financially penalise clubs that overspend, with the fines increasing the more they spend. The collected money would then be shared among the clubs who followed the rules or put into an 'emergency fund' to help EFL clubs in financial trouble.",
      "This system is similar to what's used in America's Major League Baseball and National Basketball Association, where it acts as a 'soft' salary cap.",
      "Another suggested change is 'anchoring', which involves a type of salary cap linked directly to the wage bill of the team who finished last in the Premier League. Alternatively, the rules could be changed to align more with UEFA's, which restricts spending on wages, transfers, and agent fees to 70 percent of the club's income.",
      "The Daily Mail also reports that a vote to reverse the February ruling on related-party transactions could also be on the cards. This involves deals within multi-club networks or with sponsors who have the same owners as a club - such as City and Newcastle, and Man United, with new co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe and INEOS having a stake in French side Nice.",
      "In February, an amendment to these rules was approved by the narrowest of margins. With seven votes needed to block a proposal, there were six against with two abstentions.",

      "Fredricson returns from the sidelines",
      "Tyler Fredricson started every FA Youth Cup game in the run to the 2021/22 final against Nottingham Forest, but unfortunately, he was forced to miss that game through illness.",
      "The young defender's partnership with Rhys Bennett was crucial and he heavily contributed to the Youth Cup success, despite being cruelly denied the chance to lift the trophy.",
      "He signed his first professional contract with United shortly after the final and he was promoted to U21 level in the following season, while also training with the first team.",
      "Erik ten Hag named Fredricson on the bench for United's match against Real Sociedad in September 2022 and he was considered one of the most promising young talents at the club, but he only returned from a 16-month period on the sidelines a few weeks ago.",

      "United made an academy trip to France over the weekend to give youngsters an overseas experience and behind-closed-doors fixtures at AS Monaco and OGC Nice were arranged.",
      "The young Reds won 2-1 against Monaco and Bendito Mantato scored a late match-winner to win the friendly, with Amir Ibragimov, another highly-regarded talent, also scoring. Nice won 3-2 in their clash against United on Easter Monday and Mantato scored again in that defeat.",
      "“This is always an exciting time of the year for our young players as they get the chance to experience travelling to tournaments and fixtures together,” said academy director Nick Cox.",
      "“Each trip has different aims depending on the age group involved. Whether it is for cultural education, experiencing playing teams outside of our domestic games programme or learning how to represent the club abroad, our players enjoy a huge amount of personal and professional development from these opportunities.\"",

      "Gore joined United from Burnely at 13 and the decision was made to drop him deeper into midfield because he'd previously operated as a forward, and he was prolific.",
      "Remarkably, Gore scored over 100 goals each season while playing for Burney's academy and you can read his Under-10 report card below. Thanks again to Mike Hargreaves for sending it because little nuggets like that from a young player's path are rare to come across.",
      "Mantato's goalscoring form",

      "Hannibal started successive games against Burnley and Crystal Palace, but he fell out of favour and joined Sevilla on loan for the remainder of the season in the January window.",
      "However, that move hasn't gone to plan and something drastic would have to change for Sevilla to trigger their option to sign the midfielder for £17m.",

      "Most recently, pundit Jamie Redknapp spoke about an apparent lack of effort during the weekend’s Premier League draw against Brentford.

      "That last happened more recently than some may think - February and March 2021 during a stultifying streak of three goalless draws. Failure to score at West Ham would see another post-Ferguson record tumble: United have never gone four games without a goal since the Scot headed upstairs to the Old Trafford directors' box.",

      "The tight turnaround post-Christmas of a game on Boxing Day at Stoke and against Chelsea on December 28 essentially reprieved Van Gaal. United were spirited and enterprising in a goalless draw with champions Chelsea, hitting the woodwork twice on a night United-themed Jose Mourinho scarves were sold on the Old Trafford forecourt amid the possibility of a mid-season approach.",
      "Ten Hag does not face a similar threat. The Ineos Group's minority stake has still not been ratified at the time of writing and the sole kingmaker at a club with an interim chief executive and a football director on borrowed time is the absentee landlord Joel Glazer.",
      "There is not an obvious and available upgrade as there was with Mourinho. The majority of United supporters would rather have Ten Hag over Graham Potter, a fine coach who oversaw magnificent progress with Brighton, but is more suited to succeeding Gareth Southgate as England manager after the European Championship.",
      "Potter is only at the top of bookies' chalkboards as he is free. He is followed by Zinedine Zidane and Julen Lopetegui, also both out of work. Antonio Conte and Hansi Flick are also up there.",

Ten Hag does not face a similar threat and authority to the United manager's role was restored with his appointment. Removing him would empower the minority of players looking to wait it out. The specific booing of a gaggle of players against Bournemouth was significant.",

Van Gaal's methods irked several players who continued to undermine him days before the FA Cup final but the spectre of Mourinho was ample motivation not to down tools. There was also the glory of the FA Cup to play for.",

It's been a great shame to see a chapter of his career - the world was once at his feet - wasted over something that should have been quickly quashed, but it would be foolish to underestimate egos in football.",
      "Although Sancho is remarkably the last United forward to have scored a home Premier League goal, he hasn't been missed and he's expected to leave in the January transfer window.",

      "Sancho has, rather crucially, still not apologised and that's why the stalemate with his manager has rumbled on into the winter. The player strongly believes he's not done anything wrong and he's refused to back down.",
      "Whoever Sancho is taking advice from clearly isn't qualified to provide him with counsel. His stubbornness has cost him months of his career and it wouldn't have taken much to apologise without meaning it.",

However, there seems to be a lack of discipline in his life and Nemanja Matic recently said he was regularly late to training. There have also been timekeeping issues when he's represented England and Borussia Dortmund.",
      "Sancho needs to address that to progress in his career, but an apology is all he needs to make right now. Yet it's clear that's not going to happen and that his ego is standing in the way of a resolution. Interestingly, Raphael Varane this week discussed the challenge of becoming an elite player in a lengthy post on LinkedIn - where he doesn't post often - and he spoke of the importance of controlling ego.",
      "He wrote: \"As someone who has played international and Champions League football, I feel extremely lucky to have done so. I also know what is required to get here. A critical element of reaching the top level is making the right decisions for yourself.",
      "\"Many of these decisions stem from ego, something that for me is one of the most important things to keep control of, and can give you a better mentality when used correctly. In football and in life, I have found that, as long as you have a strong mindset and continue to act on it, you can reach new heights.",
      "\"The accolades and recognition you get are a consequence of the decisions you make. If you focus on the process and enjoy the small improvements rather than only focusing on the result, you can always achieve great things.\"",
      "It would be wrong to suggest a post from Varane was a subliminal message to Sancho but sometimes the shoe fits and it's the type of advice he should be listening to instead of refusing to apologise. Furthermore, Varane is well-placed to give such advice after falling out of favour with Ten Hag himself and seeing Jonny Evans start over him.",
      "Varane has started the last two games against Bayern Munich and Liverpool and it would be bizarre to see him moved back to the bench in the coming weeks considering his performance at Anfield.",

      "Man Utd showed character to hold on and get a good point away at Anfield in the Premier League on Sunday afternoon.",
      "If you can't win a game, then it is imperative that you don't lose. The biggest compliment you pay Manchester United is that they actually did that yesterday.",
      "Liverpool's 7-0 thrashing earlier in the year was still very much fresh in the memory and much of the talk ahead of the match was about how many the home side would win by rather than if they would at all.",
      "United have been hammered for the pathetic nature of some of their defeats this season, particularly against Newcastle and Bournemouth in recent weeks, and the lack of character shown on such occasions, but this time they just did enough.",
      "This is a United side that is still relying on moments to have any joy against the very best sides and in the biggest moments at Anfield, they somehow found a way for them to turn their way.",
      "United have been guilty of overcomplicating things under Ten Hag and trying to run before they can walk, but this was a case of keeping things simple so that they had the foundations in place to possibly nick a positive result.",
      "It was always going to rely on a little bit of luck at the back to withstand the Liverpool bombardment and a bit of brilliance in attack for United to make the most of their infrequent forays into the opposition half. They worked for their luck, but once again their lack of experience in the forward line was glaring.",
      "Liverpool were always going to be on top, so there was little surprise to see United adopt a defensive approach to counter it. Yet, no matter how ugly and unorthodox it was at times, they stubbornly survived with a show of real willingness and determination.",
      "United were never going to beat Jurgen Klopp's side at their own game but they would always stand a chance if they dug deep, frustrated the home side and played the seasonal role of pantomime villains.",
      "Andre Onana hesitated over every goalkick until the last possible nanosecond and Antony riled the home crowd with his fiery contest against Konstantinos Tsimikas. Just as important, though, was the experience of Raphael Varane and Jonny Evans at the heart of the United defence. They are the ninth different centre-back pairing used already this season, and between them, they have seen it all.",
      "They dug deep with their defensive work and organised backline. They used every trick in the book to ruin the rhythm of the match and disrupt Liverpool from bombarding the goal in the same manner they had started the match.",
      "But even on the rare occasions United penetrated the Liverpool backline, they lacked the composure and clinical finishing required to make the home side pay. Alejandro Garnacho took a poor touch, Rasmus Hojlund fired at Alisson Becker and Scott McTominay launched a speculative shot well wide of goal.",
      "On another day, one of those chances might have gone in and they would have won the game. Liverpool could say exactly the same about the opportunities they somehow squandered.",
      "That in itself is the ultimate compliment you can pay this United team. It wasn't a memorable match, but it was a memorable performance for the way they dug deep and almost nicked the match themselves.",
      "So perhaps a draw was a fair result. Liverpool dominated but there were plenty of false dawns and for all the pressure they applied to the United goal, they still struggled to carve out any clear-cut chances to score.",
      "It is a credit to United that Liverpool fans were the ones leaving Anfield annoyed. Now that is a shock.",

      "Man Utd produced their best performance of the season in beating Everton with a team that looked familiar to previous eras.",
      "It was Manchester United's best away win under Erik ten Hag but came with a heavy dose of nostalgia. Squint a little and there was more than the faint outline of an Ole Gunnar Solskjaer team in action in red at Goodison Park.",
      "There were Victor Lindelof and Harry Maguire propelling everything thrown at them at centre-back. Scott McTominay was holding the midfield together and Marcus Rashford and Antony Martial combined in attack. There was a new man in the dugout and a new goalkeeper, but plenty of familiarity aside from that.",
      "To give credit to Ten Hag, he has overseen the development and promotion of Kobbie Mainoo and taken Alejandro Garnacho to the next level, but his stamp on the team has become less evident as he has gone back to basics this season. After a shaky start to the season, that approach has worked with five wins out of six in the Premier League.",
      "The 3-0 win at Everton on Sunday was the best win of the season, as well as the first statement away win of the Ten Hag era, but it came without a single Ten Hag signing starting outfield, although Andre Onana was excellent in goal. This might be close to United's best team at the moment, but it almost certainly isn't the team that their manager wants to pick.",
      "Both Harry Maguire and Scott McTominay could have left this summer, while Mason Mount was supposed to be the final piece of the jigsaw in midfield. Ten Hag wanted his team to become more dominant in their play, but it unravelled early in the season and although injuries haven't helped, he has been forced to retreat from that ideal to get results on the board.",
      "The question now is how he goes back to moving the team on. The win at Everton was gritty and determined, but you could argue it wasn't a team playing in the image of its manager, although injuries remain a major issue for Ten Hag.",
      "When everyone is fit again, he might look to restore some of his signings to the team, but right now it's arguable only two more would get in alongside Onana, who after a nervous spell in goal is beginning to look like a very good signing.",
      "If we include Sofyan Amrabat, on whom United have an option to make the move permanent, Ten Hag has signed 11 players across his three transfer windows, at a cost of more than £400million. Some were signed to play bit-part roles, such as backup goalkeeper Altay Bayindir and free agent Jonny Evans.",
      "Maybe the same could be said for Tyrell Malacia, who is on the comeback trail after a serious knee injury, but there was an expectation he would challenge the excellent Luke Shaw and that hasn't happened. Shaw is comfortably the better player.",
      "In the centre of defence, Lisandro Martinez would get back in this team, ahead of Lindelof and alongside Maguire, but the picture in midfield is complicated. Bruno Fernandes is undroppable and Mainoo's outstanding performance at Everton has put him in the frame for more appearances, with Scott McTominay now starting seven of the last eight games in all competitions, only missing the Carabao Cup defeat to Newcastle.",
      "McTominay and Mainoo are starting ahead of Amrabat at the moment, with the Fiorentina loanee failing to make an impression on the team so far. Christian Eriksen had been showing some form of late, but Mount has had a difficult start to life at Old Trafford and his route back into the team looks complicated given the emergence of Mainoo.",
      "In attack, Rasmus Hojlund will return to take the place of Martial, despite the latter's goal at Goodison Park, but Antony will surely remain on the periphery even when fit. The £85million winger has never looked like living up to that price tag and his influence on games has been minimal this season.",
      "Ten Hag said a couple of weeks ago that Rashford would stay in the team despite his struggles for form, so having finally netted his second goal of the season his place is secure. Garnacho has also been playing well of late and after his majestic overhead kick on Sunday, there is no way he can be dropped at the moment.",
      "So at the moment, if everyone was fit, it might only be Martinez and Hojlund that join Onana in that team. If Bayindir and Evans were signed to be reserves and you can make a case that Malacia and Eriksen were also deals to add strength to the team, it still leaves Casemiro, Mount, Amrabat and Antony on the outside.",
      "The majority of these players would be in the team that Ten Hag wants to build at United. But for now, the approach to getting results might be leaving some of them out of favour.",

      "Jack Fletcher and Tyler Fletcher have appeared in the FA Youth Cup and Uefa Youth League for Man United already this season and are only still 16.",
      "\"When they're on the pitch, we don't know which is which\" was a chant incepted for the Da Silva twins and it could soon be allocated to the Fletchers.",
      "Tyler and Jack were regulars in the Old Trafford directors' box last season while still in the Manchester City academy and in attendance on derby day. Amid the bedlam over Bruno Fernandes' equaliser and Marcus Rashford's winner, nobody clocked whether the teenagers dared to celebrate.",
      "The 16-year-olds' allegiance will almost certainly have been with their father, Darren. The United technical director has to walk past the front row of journalists in the press box to take his seat with the United analysts towards the back of the Sir Bobby Charlton Stand. Occasionally, he will wave at his sons and wife Hayley.",
      "The Fletcher twins' devotion to the red side of Manchester was confirmed when they crossed the divide to join United's academy in the summer for a combined fee of £1.25million. Should they emulate their father, they would become the 13th set of brothers to play for the United first team.",
      "Jack and Tyler were born on the same day Cristiano Ronaldo settled an FA Cup quarter-final replay with Middlesbrough in March 2007. Darren was present for their birth as he was recovering from an ankle injury.",
      "It was barely seven years ago that nine-year-old Jack and Tyler Fletcher were having a kickabout on the Hawthorns pitch with Kai Rooney eight days before Christmas. Darren was halfway through his final season at West Brom and soon started heading up the M6 and towards home in Manchester, spending two years with Stoke City.",
      "Fletcher attended meetings at Old Trafford towards the end of his playing career with the intention of joining United's new structure. His return was formally confirmed in January 2021 as a first-team coach and two months later he was appointed the technical director.",
      "If Erik ten Hag needs numbers in training on a recovery day for senior players, he or assistant Mitchell van der Gaag will consult Fletcher, who has become a conduit between the academy and the first team. Fletcher first encountered a hirsute Van der Gaag when he collected stickers for his Scottish Premiership album in the mid-90s. Van der Gaag spent two years at Motherwell.",
      "Jack Fletcher first got the call to head across from the academy building, past the 'fountain of youth' and into the main team hub at Carrington in November. He has trained a handful of times with the first team while Tyler has started twice for the youth team.",
      "It is worth reminding the Fletchers do not turn 17 until March 19. The Manchester-born brothers have played for England and Scotland at youth level and Tyler has pledged his allegiance to Scotland while Jack has chosen to represent England.",
      "Tyler made his international debut for Scotland in September 2022, then played for England two months later, defected back to Scotland last February before playing with Jack for England in their triumphant Montaigu Tournament in April.",
      "Tyler played in an Under-17 European Championship qualifier for Scotland against Belarus in October and the next month Jack was in the England line-up for their qualifying win against Croatia.",
      "The Fletchers joined the City academy in 2014 - when their father was still a player at United. A source who watched Jack in the City academy is adamant he will play for the United first team. Sources at United stressed the Fletchers would not have been recruited from City if the club did not see first-team potential in them.",
      "Jack has already graced the Old Trafford pitch, long before his father first did five days after his 18th birthday against Hartlepool in the FA Youth Cup in 2002. Sir Alex Ferguson intended to give Darren his debut as a 16-year-old against Aston Villa in May 2000 yet Fletcher senior's first two years at United were stunted by injury.",
      "Jack was virtuoso in the FA Youth Cup win against Derby County at Old Trafford last month and his raking half-volleyed pass made it possible for Ethan Williams to notch the only goal. Fletcher's technique made Ben Thornley, the fleet-footed Class of '92 winger on co-commentary for MUTV in the press box, purr before it had even reached Ethan Wheatley.",
      "The memory is already soured. Swindon shocked United in the fourth round on Tuesday night with a 2-0 win at the County Ground.",
      "Jack got a ticking off from the referee for backchat. One of his corners failed to beat the first man and the second seconds later went over everyone. He ended the game bickering with an opponent. Fletcher's father excelled at playing the opponent rather than the occasion and Jack will have to learn from a galling evening in Wiltshire.",
      "United are reluctant to elaborate on the Fletcher twins' development. A source said staff want to \"keep it as low-key as possible\", perhaps conscious of overhyping two lads who would be in Year 12 if still at school, or fuelling any accusations of nepotism. An early ejection from the Youth Cup vindicates the reticence.",
      "Tyler posed for his intimate unveiling photo, clutching a shirt with 'Fletcher 6', in the Old Trafford boardroom in August. In the background, there was a framed monochrome photograph of Ryan Giggs triumphantly hoisting the European Cup on the Manchester Airport tarmac in 2008. Peer closer and Darren is visible in the background on the passenger boarding steps.",
      "On the same day, Jack stood on the Old Trafford pitch and brandished his own shirt. That was one way to tell which is which.",

      "Man United youngster Dan Gore has made excellent progress over the last 18 months, so the MEN spoke to two of his former coaches at Burnley to discuss his journey to the first-team at Old Trafford.",
      "Dan Gore couldn't help but smile throughout his post-match interview after making his Manchester United debut.",
      "Gore made his senior bow against Crystal Palace in the Carabao Cup and he fought an excitable grin as he answered questions. The game also coincided with his 19th birthday and his family were present to enjoy the occasion, which Gore described as 'truly special' after growing up supporting the club.",
      "“It tops the list of birthdays,\" Gore said while trying to keep his composure. \"I don’t think words can describe that feeling, seeing the fans, it is everything you’ve dreamed of, coming true. It means everything.\"",
      "Gore became the 247th player to make his debut from the academy that night, reward for making excellent progress and convincing Erik ten Hag he was ready.",
      "He trained with the first-team for 12 weeks before his debut and is known to 'train every day like his life depends on it', something which his former coaches at Burnley loved about him.",
      "Although Gore is a Salford-lad and he idolised Wayne Rooney and Cristiano Ronaldo when he was a kid, he only joined United in 2018, having previously been at Burnley where he played as a forward, not a midfielder.",
      "\"He first came through the door when he was seven or eight,\" Lewis Craig told the Manchester Evening News. \"Burnley were very good at recruiting the Scouse and Manc kids and Dan was a raw, inner-city Manchester lad.",
      "\"Those types seemed to have that little bit more extra bite than your local kids. He was a forward when he came to us and he’d either play wide left or right or as the number nine and he was the top scorer through his age groups.",
      "\"He was quick and very strong for his size. He always had aggression and he was one of the kids who played on the edge, in terms of maybe making the odd bad challenge, but it was interesting because he was always respectful.",
      "\"He had great finishing ability in his younger years, one-on-one, going past people and he always had that bit where he was a winner. If he was getting beat, there was nobody on the pitch who hated it more and you could see that fire in him. Dan had that brilliant, real f****** horrible side to him, but he'd always be respectful with coaches and it wasn't a surprise when I saw him three months ago and he ran over and gave me a hug when I hadn’t seen him for years.\"",
      "Gore joined United at 13 and the decision was made to drop him deeper into midfield. \"My last day working for Burnley, I had to deliver his review to his dad,\" Craig said when asked about his position change.",
      "\"Although he was a great striker, I didn’t think he scored poachers goals, like your Harry Kane or Ole Gunnar Solskjaer. He scored amazing goals and he was off the charts, but I thought he could be a better instinctive finisher.",
      "\"I remember his dad saying thank you because all he'd had for a couple of years was people telling him how good he was and nobody had said things to work on. He was prolific and he’d beat a few men and fire one into the top corner, but if someone wrapped a ball across the 18-yard box at speed, he probably didn’t have that instinctive finish in him every time.",
      "\"But he worked on it religiously. He always worked on stuff and he was in training early, even as a kid. I never pictured him as a midfielder because although his awareness was decent, it's different playing in that role. He’s developed his awareness now and when I see him driving the ball in midfield, it’s similar to how he played back then.\"",
      "Mike Hargreaves, who considers Gore as the best young player he's encountered, is another former Burnley coach who worked with the youngster and he spoke to the MEN about that period.",
      "\"I worked with Danny at Burnley from Under-9s to Under-12s and I took that age group all the way through, so I worked with him for quite a while, and outside of Burnley with my own coaching,\" Hargreaves said.",
      "\"Some of the things I’ve seen him do for United, he’s been doing since back then. He’s dropped deeper now, but when he played up front for Burnley he'd score over 100 goals each season and I’m not even exaggerating.",
      "\"There was a game at Blackburn once when we built possession well, Dan picked the ball up inside his own half and he just started running past people and he ended up finishing it off, which was unbelievable. There was another time when he faced someone up, stopped the ball dead and did the Yannick Bolaise showboating thing when he bent down and flicked the grass, so he had a little bit of cheekiness about him.",
      "\"He was a matchwinner and they were a really good group. I always thought It was just a matter of time before United would come in for him and I always expected that. I can’t think of many times he didn't have a good day.\"",
      "Hargreaves continued: \"His real stand-out qualities were he was hard-working, aggressive, he put himself about and he was a really exciting dribbler. He was fantastic with the ball and capable of sprinting repeatedly. His speed endurance was phenomenal, even at those ages. His attitude was great and he was demanding of his teammates and the standards of the session.",
      "\"Towards the end of Under-11s, we had a tournament on Blackpool’s pitch and it was a full-day affair. We played United in the final of that and Danny scored. They were just completely top draw that day as a group.",
      "\"I remember building up to that tournament for a few weeks and reiterating what we were building up to and you’d see a change in him, almost like a switch being flicked and a refocus. You could see he wanted to win.\"",
      "The burning desire to improve and win has seen Gore become a member of the first-team squad with Ten Hag in charge and he's worn the captain's armband when playing in academy matches this season.",
      "\"He’s captain material I'd say,\" Craig added. \"Almost like your old-school Roy Keane type with hard challenges, but he’s got unbelievable quality on the ball because he was a forward in the past as well.",
      "\"In that Under-21 group at United, there have been the likes of Shola Shoretire and Isak Hasen-Aaroen but it seems like there's been something missing in them, which doesn’t seem to be the case with Dan. If you leave him in an environment long enough he thrives and I think it's fair to say that Dan wasn’t a Burnley type of player, in the sense that he was probably beyond Burnley in terms of his ability.",
      "\"He would have played for Burnley’s first-team if he was still there and Sean Dyche would have been all over him, but there was always an acceptance of Dan was Salford, Man United and there were murmurings going on in the background. Kids get poached in academies all the time, but I think Burnley got looked after with the deal when he did go over. And I think he was given certain guarantees because United knew the talent they were getting.\"",
      "Gore was part of the FA Youth Cup winning side in 2022 and although Alejandro Garnacho was the poster boy of that campaign, his partnership with Kobbie Mainoo in midfield was instrumental in the success. More than 60,000 supporters watched the final at Old Trafford and Gore kissed the badge when the full time whistle went. It wasn't a surprise for a boy who used to wear a red thermal vest under his Burnley shirt.",
      "\"You can tell what Manchester United means to him when he plays,\" Craig said. \"I went to the Youth Cup final and I just thought he was outstanding, doing the horrible side of the game really well.",
      "\"I thought out of possession, Dan was excellent, picking up second balls and showing all the stuff he's added to his game as a midfielder and you can see he's got a real understanding of the game now.\"",
      "Hargreaves was also in the crowd and he briefly talked to Gore during the celebrations. \"I saw him right at the end when they were doing the lap of honour because I was sitting near the front, so I went down and shouted.",
      "\"He said 'aaaah Mike!' and I congratulated him, so it was nice to have that moment and I did have to laugh because near the end of the Youth Cup final, he was tapping his head and telling people to focus.",
      "\"That’s stuck with me because it’s something I do myself. We had great times at Burnley and he was the star of the group. I’ve got a great relationship with him and his dad, who was always very grateful for us looking after him.\"",
      "Gore has been on an upward trajectory since and Bruno Fernandes is understood to have been very welcoming to the youngster, taking a hands-on role in his integration into the first-team. Sources have also indicated Jonny Evans has been especially supportive and offered Gore plenty of advice since they started training together in mid-July, which the 19-year-old has appreciated.",
      "\"You’re around top players every day at United and you either adapt or die,\" Craig said. \"Even if he ends up making 100 appearances for United in the Premier League or with another club, he'll get the most out of himself.",
      "\"Ten Hag has been known for developing youngsters at Ajax and he doesn’t put people in who aren’t good enough. I'm really proud of him and it's lovely when you bump into him, or get a text.\"",
      "Hargreaves echoed those comments: \"It’s been brilliant to see him progress and I’m a United fan myself, so I'm extremely pleased because it's more than he deserves. I genuinely think he embodies what a United player should be, bringing excitement, being hard-working and holding himself in the right way.\"",
      "Gore recently shaved his head - going for a buzzcut style - and there was a large smile on his face when he revealed his new haircut to his amused teammates at Carrington. That wide grin doesn't seem to be going away anytime soon.",

      "Littler, a staunch United fan, came on to stage at the AO Arena in Manchester moments after watching his side conceded two goals in injury time to lose 4-3 at Stamford Bridge and claimed a second successive weekly Premier League win, beating Gerwyn Price 6-3 in the final.",
      "The 17-year-old star, who enjoyed a maiden victory in Belfast last week, was happy to give United fans in attendance something to cheer about.",
      "\"We were watching backstage, we were winning 3-2 and we conceded a penalty and Cole Palmer scored and then he scored again,\" Littler said.",

      "Having already won titles at the Bahrain Masters, PDC Players Championship and Belgian Open, he is now all-but certain to qualify for the play-offs at the O2 in London.",
      "\"I just try and live my life as I have done so far,\" he said. \"As a 17-year-old boy, I just know every week playing these guys I have looked up to, I just thrive off it. All I do is stay in my zone. I just do what I do.\"",
      "Price produced his best performance of this year's competition and became the first man to throw a perfect set of darts since he did it twice in a night in Belfast in 2022. And his run to the final raises his hopes of getting to the O2, though he has a lot of work to do in the final few weeks.",
      "Littler's night started well as he took a winning record in his rivalry with Michael van Gerwen. It had been tied at 3-3 but Littler moved ahead with a 6-3 quarter-final win before beating Nathan Aspinall in the semi-final, thanks largely to 131, 90 and 136 checkouts.",
      "Price was superb in beating Peter Wright in the quarter-final before a magnificent performance, capped by the nine-dart finish, sent him to the final.",

      "Man Utd have struggled for balance without Lisandro Martinez this season and the Argentine has suffered a series of injury setbacks.",
      "It's a small sample size but the stats point to Lisandro Martinez's importance to this Manchester United team. With the World Cup winner in the starting XI they are winning 56% of the time. Without him, that drops to 44%.",
      "The bad news for United and Erik ten Hag is that the centre-back has only been fit enough to start nine games this season. The even worse news is that he faces another month on the sidelines with a muscle injury, the third separate issue that has forced him onto the sidelines this season.",
      "United's record with Martinez in the side is even better than those raw numbers attest to. Of the four defeats with him in the starting XI, three were away at Tottenham, Arsenal and Bayern Munich before the end of September. There have been far more disastrous performances this season than those games.",
      "Since then the 26-year-old has managed to start just three games, which came in succession in January and February when Newport County, Wolves and West Ham were beaten, with 11 goals scored. Martinez makes a difference to this team at both ends of the pitch.",
      "He is perhaps the most irreplaceable member of the squad, especially when Luke Shaw is also injured, which has been a regular occurrence this season. As a left-footed centre-back comfortable with the ball at his feet, Martinez brings balance to the team.",
      "That quality aids the build-up play, increases the passing options from defence, giving the opposition more possibilities to contend with, and allows United to play out from Andre Onana. When Martinez isn't available, those traits are gone. The build-up play becomes more predictable.",
      "His muscle injury, added to foot and knee problems already picked up, are turning this season into a write-off for a player who has claims of being Ten Hag's best signing. He is expected to return before the end of the season but he will miss most of the run-in. If United reach the FA Cup final in his absence they will desperately hope he is fit enough to be in the team at Wembley.",
      "But beyond the end of this season, United's struggles to replace him have sharpened minds ahead of the transfer window. A centre-back and a striker are the priorities this summer and it is clear the first of those needs to be a defender capable of filling in for Martinez.",
      "There are going to be changes at the back this summer. Harry Maguire could still depart despite enjoying a fine season after rejecting West Ham a year ago. Raphael Varane and Jonny Evans are both out of contract and could move on.",
      "United have an interest in Everton centre-back Jarrad Branthwaite and have also reportedly watched Max Kilman at Wolves this summer. Both are strong on their left foot and can play on that side of the defence.",
      "In Branthwaite's case, that is where he is currently playing for the Toffees. He is strong with both feet and is a good passer of the ball. Kilman is a left-footed central defender but generally plays on the right of a back three for Wolves, but could operate on the left.",
      "Both are over 6' 3\" and it gives us an indication of the type of centre-back United want this summer. Someone who can add height and physicality to the defence while also offering another left-sided option. Given how much they have missed Martinez this season, it makes sense.",

      "A number of players left in the summer with Edinson Cavani, Jesse Lingard, Juan Mata, Nemanja Matic and Paul Pogba all ending their spells at Old Trafford. Over £200m was spent bolstering Ten Hag's squad as a rebuild started.",
      "Lisandro Martinez joined Ten Hag in switching Amsterdam for Manchester in a deal worth up to £57m with left-back Tyrell Malacia also moving from the Eredivisie for £14.7m. Serial Champions League winner Casemiro arrived from Real Madrid late in the window but it was the marquee arrival of Antony that turned heads.",
      "The Brazilian cost United £86m - making him the club's most expensive arrival since Paul Pogba in 2016 - after proving his worth under Ten Hag at Ajax. After arriving from Sao Paulo, the forward scored 24 times and provided a further 22 assists for the Dutch giants over two seasons.",
      "Antony signed a five-year contract with the Reds and was tipped to be a key figure in Ten Hag's project. However, the 24-year-old has struggled to adapt to English football and his price tag is constantly brought up whenever he fails to deliver.",
      "In his debut season, the Brazilian scored eight goals and assisted just three. This year has continued to be a struggle, with him starting just 17 games in all competitions and managing only two FA Cup goals.",
      "The £86m price tag has been a big topic of discussion since the deal was completed, though more concerns emerged when it was revealed that United scouts valued Antony cheaper than what they paid for him. During Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's tenure at Old Trafford, a £25m valuation was placed on the attacker's head - the club paid more than triple that.",
      "Although United aren't expected to cut-ties with Antony and sell him any time soon, if or when that time does come they could face a huge loss. According to Transfermarkt, the left-footed attacker's market value has continued to plummet during his time in England.",
      "At the end of last season, he was valued at £51.3m. That figure has halved since June 2023 with him now valued at £23.9m. Ironically, that figure is closer to the initial valuation of United's scouts two years ago.",

      "There is optimism that new co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe and his Ineos group can overhaul United's footballing operations and provide a strategy which will see the club compete for major honours again. This summer will be the new regime's first opportunity to enact changes to the playing squad at Old Trafford as United face a vital transfer window.",
      "There does however remain uncertainty over which European competition United will be involved in next season, with Champions League football the main priority to earn greater revenue and attract better quality talent. And the rumour mill is in full swing as United look ahead to a summer rebuild which could see a huge number of changes",
      "The Evening Standard reports that United are interested in Nice left-back Melvin Bard. They claim that the 23-year-old is being discussed as a summer transfer target amid the injury woes of Luke Shaw and Tyrell Malacia this season.",
      "Bard has made 28 appearances for the Ligue 1 side this season with Nice owned by United co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe's Ineos group. The Frenchman's current contract expires in June 2026.",
      "Elsewhere, reports in Il Matino have claimed that United are also interested in Napoli right-back Giovanni Di Lorenzo. It is claimed that the Red Devils and Aston Villa have ‘tabled offers’ of personal terms for the Italy international, which will be ‘evaluated’ by the player.",
      "It is said that United have taken confidence from Di Lorenzo considering leaving Napoli. The report claims that the former Empoli star is yet to make a concrete decision on his future, and is waiting to see who his current side appoints as their manager over the summer before making a decision.",

      "Erik ten Hag has disputed suggestions Manchester United's training sessions are too intense amid their latest injury crisis.",
      "Centre backs Victor Lindelof (hamstring) and Lisandro Martinez (calf) have been ruled out for a month and Martinez, who has appeared in only 11 of United's 41 matches this season, suffered the setback in training on Tuesday.",
      "Casemiro, who never had a muscular injury during his eight-year career at Real Madrid, is believed to have partly blamed the intensity of United's training sessions on his hamstring problems this season. The 32-year-old was sidelined for two-and-a-half months with a hamstring injury and a recurrence of the issue caused him to miss the FA Cup quarter-final victory over Liverpool last month.",
      "United have recorded 53 separate cases of injury and illness that have caused players to miss games this season and they will be without an entire back four for the Premier League fixture away to Chelsea on Thursday night.",
      "\"No, we don't train too hard,\" Ten Hag stressed. \"We need to be fit. With the standards in this league, you need to be fit. Otherwise you can't match the standards you are required in a game. We don’t train too hard.\"",
      "Ten Hag also insisted it was not an issue that he did not add his own fitness coach to United's backroom staff. \"No. We have good departments, we have good people around with a lot of knowledge. Based on data we make our decisions.\"",
      "United played 62 games last season and the most they can play this season is 52. Their complete elimination from European competition has given United freer midweeks this calendar year but Ten Hag is adamant the schedule of domestic, European and international fixtures continues to have an adverse effect on the injury toll at clubs.",
      "\"I know that it still has an effect, the huge amount of games we had in the last 18 months,\" Ten Hag said. \"That still has an impact on our squad, the accumulation on the players.",
      "\"You need very robust players. That is the requirement. When you go into Christmas with many injuries and then you have to bring them back. But when they are free from injury they are not match fit.",
      "\"They are not straight back into the form, that also needs a couple of games before you get back into the rhythm. It still has an impact.",
      "\"Anywhere, the players, the people get overloaded and they can't bring the performances anymore. We are already over the point where we demand what we want from our top players.",
      "\"You see this weekend, City is playing without [Kyle] Walker, without [John] Stones. You see the levels were dropping without them. There was a different team to what we faced. The levels for teams will keep dropping if you keep going in this process we are in overloading the international competition.",
      "\"You can't 100 per cent avoid this (injuries), it is impossible. You depend on certain facts. Also we have national teams five times a year you give the players away and you don’t have any impact.",
      "\"Some national teams we have very good connections and we manage the programmes, but there are also others that do what they want. You don’t have anything in hand on what they are doing there.",
      "\"I think we have more players who are very robust like Bruno [Fernandes] is. But yeah, that is the type of player you need, yeah.\"",

      "Ivan Toney has been a talismanic figure for Brentford since returning to the Premier League in August 2021 and could be the answer to Manchester United's problems up front",
      "Manchester United would turn into Premier League title challengers if they signed Ivan Toney, according to the Peterborough United chairman who signed the forward six years ago.",
      "The 28-year-old Brentford striker has scored four goals in 11 Premier League games since returning from an eight-month ban for breaching the Football Association's gambling laws. Since firing the Bees to promotion in May 2021, Toney has scored 36 goals in 77 Premier League outings.",
      "Toney, who has less than 18 months remaining on his current deal at Brentford, has been linked with moves to Arsenal, Tottenham, Liverpool and West Ham in recent weeks. However, Peterborough United chairman Darragh MacAnthony believes Toney could turn Erik ten Hag's side into title challenges should he make the move to Old Trafford and would prove value for money, even at £100m.",
      "Speaking on Sky Sports, MacAnthony, who signed Toney for the Posh from Newcastle United in 2018, said: \"Put him in an Arsenal team, put him in a Liverpool or a Man United team, he scores 30 Premier League goals in a season. I think anyone who disagrees with that hasn't been watching the last two-and-a-half years.",
      "\"I think there are five clubs in the world who could probably end up buying him and he will improve any of those clubs by a mile. He turns Manchester United into challengers for the Premier League.\"",
      "Toney was a thorn in United's side at the Gtech Community Stadium last Saturday as he laid on a stoppage-time assist for Kristoffer Ajer to equalise against the Reds, and MacAnthony believes the two-cap England international will only get better in the years ahead.",
      "\"Having scouted players not just for their technical ability but their personality and their growth for 18 years, I think he's not even in his prime even though he's turning 28,\" added the 48-year-old. \"Whoever buys him, £100m will be well spent because he's coming into his prime. You're going to get five or six years of his best.",
      "\"He's scored a goal every other game in the Premier League for Brentford. Put Ivan in an Aston Villa team under [Unai] Emery and see how many goals he scores in the Premier League. He'd probably be up there for the Golden Boot.\"",
      "Ten Hag's side have struggled for goals this season, with only Nottingham Forest, Crystal Palace, Burnley, Everton and Sheffield United managing fewer than United's 40 in the Premier League.",
      "Marcus Rashford, Rasmus Hojlund and Scott McTominay are the club's leading scorers in the Premier League this season (7), while Champions League rivals Aston Villa and Tottenham Hotspur are able to boast the prolificacy of Ollie Watkins (16) and Son Heung-Min (15).",

      "When an injured Lisandro Martinez still linked up with the Argentina squad in September, the word from Manchester United was it would be beneficial for him to be surrounded by his compatriots.",
      "A penny for Sir Alex Ferguson’s thoughts. Paul Scholes was omitted from an England squad on the Friday due to an upcoming hernia operation and played for United on the Monday against Middlesbrough. If Ferguson was the manager, Argentina nor Martinez would have dared ask the question.",
      "Martinez returned from South America, played twice and United lost both games against Brighton and Bayern Munich, conceding seven goals. Martinez underwent corrective surgery on a metatarsal fracture and did not play again until January.",
      "Times have changed and United have changed. Not for the better. Clubs should be selfish over a player’s availability yet Martinez, sidelined for six weeks, flew to Los Angeles a fortnight ago to train with his international teammates.",
      "Granted, his second-half introduction at Brentford was enforced. Raphael Varane was substituted as a precaution at the interval and Victor Lindelof sustained a hamstring injury in the second half.",
      "Yet this is the problem at United. There have been 53 separate cases of injury or illness that have caused a player to miss a game this season. Martinez returned before the eight-week timescale he was ruled out for with medial collateral ligament damage. Now he is out for another month.",
      "Since he first fractured his metatarsal against Sevilla last April, Martinez has started eight club games. The lucklessness of two impact injuries preceded a calf injury on Tuesday.",
      "The unwritten rule in sport is impact injuries are rotten luck but muscular strains are avoidable. It has been reported by this correspondent and others that some United players are concerned by the intense training demands of manager Erik ten Hag. Casemiro partly blamed it for a recurrence of the hamstring injury that caused him to miss the FA Cup win over Liverpool. Another player is understood to be playing within himself to avoid injury.",
      "Ten Hag brought an assistant coach and an analyst with him from Ajax but not a fitness coach. Louis van Gaal did and so did Jose Mourinho, a big believer in playing through the pain barrier and dismissive behaviour of certain physiological methods. It seems a grave oversight by Ten Hag when sources at Carrington say he treats recovery days more seriously than any of his predecessors.",
      "Marcus Rashford felt Ole Gunnar Solskjaer ran him into the ground and Ten Hag is not negligent. Returning players seldom complete 90 minutes on their return and Aaron Wan-Bissaka and Rasmus Hojlund were both substituted in the victory over Liverpool with United 2-1 down.",
      "But Ten Hag has taken needless risks. Starting Christian Eriksen against Championship relegation fodder Reading in the FA Cup last season resulted in an ankle injury, a ten-week absence and an 11th-hour loan move for Marcel Sabitzer.",
      "The scrutiny also has to be trailed on club doctor Gary O'Driscoll and Charlie Owen, the United fitness coach since March 2019. Owen replaced Robin Thorpe and Gary Walker and that summer Solskjaer instructed the fitness coaches to ensure the squad was the fittest it had ever been.",
      "Before the end of August, the flies started dropping. Luke Shaw, Paul Pogba and Anthony Martial were sidelined for the long term. O'Driscoll started at United in September after spending 14 years at Arsenal.",
      "Injury crises are nothing new at United. The physio’s room was crammed under Ferguson for the 2006-07 run-in and before Christmas in 2009 when United fielded a back three of Darren Fletcher, Michael Carrick and Ritchie De Laet at Fulham. They lost 3-0.",
      "Ferguson hailed the opening of the Toshiba Medical Centre at Carrington in 2012 as “a big signing for us and probably the most important step forward we have taken in a long, long time”. United still started that season with Carrick at centre half away to Everton.",
      "Yet United remained competitive, winning the title in 2007 and 2013 and losing it by a point in 2010. Injuries have been rife at other elite clubs and players continue to reel from the backlog of fixtures since the Covid-19 pandemic. Nations League matches in mid-June 2022 and a senseless winter World Cup in Qatar have pushed players to the brink. A high-level source at United said earlier in the season Varane had told them “he can’t do it any more”.",
      "A depleted Liverpool still won the League Cup final, Tottenham schooled United at Old Trafford without five regulars and Manchester City are vying for a second Treble, having coped without Kevin De Bruyne and Erling Haaland for prolonged periods. Ten Hag’s United have crumbled.",

His numbers are wide of the mark of what he produced last term, where he contributed to 41 goals in 56 games.",

I know his family play a big part with him, which is great, but who are the external people around that?

      "The Man United defender has endured rotten luck with setbacks this campaign and is facing yet more time on the sidelines following a fresh injury blow.",
      "It will soon be a year since Lisandro Martinez suffered the first of his many injuries in a Manchester United shirt.",
      "The bulldog-like defender, who had lifted the World Cup with Argentina four months earlier, fractured his metatarsal so badly against Sevilla in a Europa League clash that opposing countrymen Marcos Acuna and Gonzalo Montiel carried him off the pitch.",
      "Martinez was then scooted down the tunnel on a stretcher, which in retrospect signalled the start of a long stretch of injury frustration. His subsequent operation forced him to miss the final 13 matches of the season, including the FA Cup final.",
      "In an update on social media on April 17, Martinez wrote: \"Everything went really well, thanks to God! Many thanks for all of your messages. Now focusing on the recovery.\" That recovery appeared to go to plan, as the 26-year-old returned in time for pre-season, playing 316 minutes across five starts during the tour of the US and domestic friendlies.",
      "However, he would play just seven matches during the regular season before his foot issue flared up once again. \"He has to be strong. He will fight back, I’m sure,” said Erik ten Hag upon the recurrence of his problem in September.",
      "Martinez required a second round of surgery and the club were careful not to rush him back. In November, during a visit to his homeland to watch former club Defensa y Justicia, Martinez encouraged fans to be “patient” with his recovery.",
      "The centre-back worked closely with club physio Ibrahim Kerem with Ten Hag insisting that the player would not return until he felt “100 per cent ready”. He consequently missed the rest of 2023.",
      "He announced his readiness to return in an Instagram post on January 4, writing: \"Really happy to be back with the team. Let’s do this together!\"",
      "Martinez has frequently been praised for his dogged determination and robust mentality, something which has been tested since that poignant night at Old Trafford last April. Since returning upon the turn of the new year, Martinez has sustained two more injuries.",
      "The first was rather freakish and unrelated to his metatarsal problems. Martinez was forced off after 71 minutes against West Ham when Vladimir Coufal clattered awkwardly on the defender’s knee.",
      "In his post-match interviews with Sky and the BBC, Erik ten Hag opened up about the latest set-back.",
      "\"I can't tell the detail but it seems bad,\" he said. \"We have to wait for the detail and making the right diagnosis in the coming days. We'll see what is going on. In this moment, we're very sad about this but, hopefully, it's not too bad. We can only pray.",
      "\"We have to find out in the next days what is the diagnosis. It's very bad for him and very bad for the team. He's just returning and is a very important part for us. Last season, when he fell out, I felt our performances dropped a level. We have to avoid that because we have a good squad and centre-backs who can fill in. But he definitely brings spirit to the team, apart from his footballing abilities.",
      "\"It's disappointing for the team and especially for Licha. It's so frustrating, he worked hard to return now for two games. It looks like he has to sit some games out injured again but let's stay positive at this moment. Hopefully, it's not too bad but we have to wait.\"",
      "Scans showed that Martinez had damaged his medial collateral ligament and was expected to be out for eight weeks. On February 5, he wrote in a post on Instagram: \"I want to give a heartfelt thanks for the great support I’ve received and to reassure you that I’ll soon be back out there, and we’ll fight together. Always united!\"",
      "After missing the Manchester derby defeat and the dramatic FA Cup win over Liverpool, he returned in Saturday’s 1-1 draw with Brentford, slightly earlier than expected.",
      "However, the news landed on Tuesday that Martinez had suffered yet another issue. His fresh calf setback is due to keep him out of action for at least another month, having played just 11 times this season.",
      "So far, Martinez has missed 30 of his club’s 42 matches this season through injury, and 41 games out of the 104 United have played since his 2022 arrival - which equates to a missed match every 2.5 matches.",
      "Martinez now faces a race against time to be back before the end of the season. United have the chance of making the FA Cup final again on May 25, and so Martinez, then, may well get the chance to play the showpiece after missing out on last year’s edition.",

      "Manchester City have 115 charges hanging over their head as the Premier League are considering major changes to Profitability and Sustainability Rules",
      "Premier League clubs are reportedly considering introducing a 'luxury tax' which would bring potential changes to how breaches of Profitability and Sustainability Rules (PSR) are punished.",
      "Manchester United and Manchester City have been watching on this season as two top-flight clubs have been charged with alleged PSR breaches - Nottingham Forest and Everton. City, on the other hand, are currently being investigated for their 115 financial charges. The club strongly deny any wrongdoing.",
      "Forest and Everton were handed points deductions by independent commissions after being found in breach of the financial rules. Forest were docked four points while Everton have been deducted six points, which was reduced from 10 on appeal, and are still awaiting the outcome of a second charge.",
      "Championship outfit Leicester City have also been charged with an alleged breach and face a hearing in front of an independent commission where they could face a possible points deduction at the start of next season if they earn promotion back to the Premier League.",
      "According to the Daily Mail, it is claimed that Premier League clubs are 'considering' getting rid of the points deduction punishment amid plans for a 'luxury tax.' It is said that as many as 17 clubs are in favour and the 'radical reform' could be voted in at the end-of-the-season meeting in June.",
      "One of the options being discussed would be to have clubs that overspend given a financial punishment, that will increase the more they spend. The fees collected could be distributed to those clubs who complied with the rules or go into an 'emergency fund' to help EFL teams in financial danger.",
      "Another option is said to be 'anchoring', where a form of salary cap related directly to the wage bill of the team who finished bottom of the Premier League is applied.",
      "There could also be a change in limiting spending on wages, transfer and agent fees to 70 percent of a club's revenue in a bid to comply with UEFA's rules.",
      "Our Business of Football writer, Dave Powell, explains: \"UEFA have long given their view that they don’t believe points deductions to be the appropriate way of dealing with financial breaches. With the Premier League moving toward new cost controls that will be more in line with UEFA’s squad cost ratio, it makes sense that they would want to try and find a way to be on the same page with regard to sanctions.",
      "\"A luxury tax exists in some North American sports leagues, not all. Across the major sports leagues there are different methods to curb reckless spending; a hard salary cap, a soft salary cap, and a luxury tax. The first is self-explanatory. Clubs know when the cap is and punishment will follow if breached.",
      "\"The second is where teams can exceed the salary cap if it is to retain an existing player. The third is where there is no limit on salaries paid, but there is a threshold that can be breached which would invoke a luxury tax to be paid. That money is then paid to the leagues, agreed by a collective bargaining agreement (CBA) between the teams and unions.",
      "\"The money is then dispersed between rival teams, as happens in Major League Baseball. The idea of this is to not make it an attractive proposition to put money in the pockets of rivals directly. In the MLB, teams are taxed 17.5 per cent for what they are over for year one, 30 per cent for year two, 40 per cent for year three and 50 per cent for four or more years.",
      "\"Liverpool owners Fenway Sports Group have plenty of experience of the luxury tax in the MLB, and their lack of spending has been to the chagrin of fans of their baseball team, the Boston Red Sox. Chelsea co-owner Todd Boehly is a part-owner of the Los Angeles Dodgers, a team that has been willing to make use of the luxury tax through high wage spend, something that has been mirrored with the approach at Chelsea. There would be some challenges to such a measure in football.",
      "\"Clubs outside the so-called ‘big six’ would want to ensure that the luxury tax was a real deterrent, and that would involve a likely major tax to be paid for breaches. That would require agreement from the majority to pass it through a members' meeting. Baseball is unionised and a CBA takes a long time to be reached, professional football isn’t organised in the same way in the UK and finding such agreement on a major key issue would be problematic.",
      "\"For a club with unlimited wealth, would they really be concerned about spending more and putting a few million in the pockets of their rivals if it meant they landed a target that could give them the best chance of winning and accruing valuable prize money? What the introduction of such a tax does point to is increased alignment with North American sport, driven by the large number of US team owners in the Premier League. Of the ‘big six’, four have American majority owners.\"",

      "Man United youngster Bendito Mantato has been subject to transfer interest from a number of the Reds' league rivals.",
      "Manchester United youngster Bendito Mantato has continued to impress after scoring six goals in three games for the academy.",
      "The Manchester Evening News revealed last month that Mantato was generating interest and the youngster was in the process of considering his options and possible next steps. Impressively, Mantato scored four goals against Blackburn in a 5-2 win for the Under-18s and he was on the scoresheet again last weekend in a friendly for the Under-21s.",
      "United made an academy trip to France over the weekend to give youngsters an overseas experience and behind-closed-doors fixtures at AS Monaco and OGC Nice were arranged. The young Reds won 2-1 against Monaco and Mantato scored a late match-winner to win the friendly, with Amir Ibragimov, another highly-regarded talent, also scoring. Nice won 3-2 in their clash against United on Easter Monday and Mantato scored again in that defeat.",
      "The youngster, who has bundles of pace, has been in prolific form and it's thought his long-term future will be on the right wing due to the attacking quality he can provide. Mantato's superb goalscoring form - six in three games - has impressed clubs and he's continued to go from strength to strength after taking part in first-team training. His dribbling ability is a huge asset and he's been backed to have a bright future at Old Trafford.",
      "It's understood talks are ongoing with United and they're set to enter a crucial stage, with the club hopeful of striking an agreement to persuade the 16-year-old to commit to his future in Manchester after a string of excellent performances for the academy.",
      "A number of rivals in the Premier League remain interested in the exciting Mantato and sources have indicated United would receive a six-figure sum in compensation if he were to switch clubs given they have been responsible for his development to this stage.",
      "Mantato can play at left-back and on the wing, and his style has led to comparisons with Arsenal's Bukayo Saka, who started his career as a defender before moving forward. Mantato joined United's academy aged nine and has represented England in the youth system. He recently made his debut for the Three Lions' Under-16s team.",

The two Manchester clubs have comfortably been the best teams in the U18 league, so it feels appropriate they've both progressed to the final of the Premier League Cup.",

Although City's U18s are behind United in the league, they won 4-1 when the sides last met earlier this month and Adam Lawrence's Reds will be keen to respond to that defeat.",

      "United's dismal campaign continued with a 3-1 defeat to Manchester City at the Etihad on Saturday afternoon",
      "With Manchester United a goal down at the Etihad, manager Marc Skinner turned frustratedly to his bench.",
      "\"Why aren't they keeping the ball?\" he asked his coaching staff as his players struggled to repel the sky-blue tidal wave that continued to make advances toward the United penalty area. His agitation, it seems, was entirely justified as, mere minutes later, his side were 2-0 down and staring down the barrel of their fifth Women's Super League (WSL) defeat of the season.",
      "\"The games that we have left, we will give everything,\" Skinner vowed to the media in his post-match press conference. \"That's what we'll always do, that's what this team is built on, it's what Manchester United is built on.\"",
      "In fairness, Skinner could hardly have been expected to say anything else. Saturday's 3-1 defeat in east Manchester means his team are now 15 points worse off than the league leaders - a fact that only becomes more sobering when you consider it is their city rivals who currently occupy that top spot.",
      "They are six points adrift of Europe, with that gap likely to widen when third-place Arsenal face off with Aston Villa tomorrow. In fact, should Liverpool avoid defeat in the Merseyside derby on Sunday afternoon, United will end the weekend in fifth place.",
      "It is quite the fall from grace for a side who missed out on the title by just two points last term and were only narrowly beaten by Chelsea in the FA Cup final. It is fair to say that if the Reds came into this season riding the crest of a wave sparked by their previous successes, then their tumultuous recent form means the club is now well and truly on the rocks.",
      "And perhaps the most frustrating thing about this weekend's defeat is that it was so predictable. Three times since the turn of the year, United have gone into a season-defining game needing to deliver. Three times they have failed to do so.",
      "Against Chelsea at Stamford Bridge, Skinner's side found themselves two goals down inside 23 minutes. Hayley Ladd clawed one back on the stroke of half-time before Lauren James' third of the day made sure of the victory for the hosts.",
      "Against Arsenal at the Emirates, United went into the break 3-0 down, with Lucia Garcia's stoppage-time goal proving to be little more than a consolation. That the Reds lost again by the same scoreline at the Etihad is a damning indictment of their ability to step up to the plate when the occasion demands it the most.",
      "Maybe the biggest compliment you could pay City on Saturday afternoon, is that they didn't have to play particularly well to get their noses in front. It was United who shaded the first half-hour of the contest before Jess Park's volley gave the hosts the advantage.",
      "It must be said that any consternation in United's ranks would have been justified, with replays showing Khadija 'Bunny' Shaw was offside in the build-up. But with no VAR to intervene, the goal stood and, from that moment on, it was hard to imagine the visitors getting back into the game.",
      "\"I actually felt we played well in large parts of the game,\" Skinner said. \"The first goal shouldn't even exist as a goal, she's offside. The difference between smaller and big stadiums is when there are more fans momentum swings quicker. The second and third goal we've got to be better for.\"",
      "Certainly, it's hard to refute the United manager's assertion that the goal changed the game. And, just eight minutes later, Park had made it two, deftly prodding the ball home after Alanna Kennedy's lofted pass into the box.",
      "On that occasion, Skinner and his players only had themselves to blame. That Park - who has proved herself to be one of the most capable players in the league in recent months - was afforded so much time and space in the penalty area will surely be one of the biggest talking points when the Reds begin their post-match post-mortem at Carrington on Monday morning.",
      "So too will the fact that City were able to carve United open so easily just seconds into the second half, with Park turning provider this time as Shaw finished coolly past a dejected Mary Earps.",
      "Hannah Blundell's strike, which deflected off Kerstin Casparij 17 minutes from time, opened the door for the unlikeliest of late United comebacks. But, as they did against Arsenal and Chelsea, the Reds had left it too late and were left to rue yet another missed opportunity to take their stuttering season off life support.",
      "Of course, there are some mitigating factors for this underwhelming campaign. Any team in world football would struggle to seamlessly replace the considerable talents of Ona Batlle and Alessia Russo, who left the club last summer for Barcelona and Arsenal respectively. Injuries have also played their part, with summer signings Gabby George and Hinata Miyazawa both having endured lengthy spells on the sidelines.",
      "But ultimately, United have just simply not been good enough. Fingers will rightly be pointed at the manager but the players must also take accountability ahead of a summer that will be crucial in shaping the club's future.",
      "Certainly, if the rest of the season is to be viewed as an audition for a long-term place in Sir Jim Ratcliffe's United regime, then Skinner and his squad must now hope for a flawless end to the campaign. \"Pressure makes you stronger,\" the Reds boss said. \"This club will rise to the levels we all want. I’m a fighter so I’m going to put myself in a position where I can make this team the best in the land. That’s my personal responsibility.\"",
      "In many ways, Skinner's defiance is admirable and speaks to a manager who has never shied away from the added pressures that come with presiding over a United team. But, no matter how valiantly he is battling to secure his future at the club, it very much feels like he is currently losing the fight.",

      "Jess Park scored a brace in Manchester City's 3-1 win over Manchester United at the Etihad Stadium",
      "If this is to be viewed as Jess Park's breakthrough season at Manchester City, then it was against Manchester United at the Etihad where she truly came of age.",
      "When big-money summer signing, Jill Roord, ruptured her anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) back in January, it was hard not to fear that the Blues' title charge might start to veer drastically off course. But Park, who joined City as a winger in 2017, is relishing her newfound responsibility in the no. 10 role and has inspired Gareth Taylor's side to huge wins over Chelsea, Arsenal and now United.",
      "For the lifelong City fan, who grew up aiming to follow in the footsteps of Sergio Aguero, it simply doesn't get much better than this; netting a brace against your arch-rivals to send your club - at least temporarily - top of the Women's Super League (WSL) table. Boyhood City fan Phil Foden did the same for men's side against United earlier in March, winning at the Etihad by the same scoreline - and now it was Park's turn.",
      "It is worth noting that it was only a few short months ago that United took to the pitch at Old Trafford two points better off than their city rivals, hoping to maintain their unbeaten start to their league campaign and truly assert themselves in the title race.",
      "Perhaps that afternoon, which ended with the visitors celebrating in front of the East Stand, was the turning point; the moment where the gulf in quality between the two sides first became apparent and the significant chasm that now separates them in the table first began to forge.",
      "Certainly, the landscape heading into this weekend’s showdown at the Etihad was very different. This time, it was advantage City, with the Blues bidding to end the day three points clear of the indomitable Chelsea ahead of their clash with West Ham United on Sunday afternoon.",
      "United, meanwhile, travelled to east Manchester as the would-be disrupters. A win at the home of their noisy neighbours would not quite abate the simmering frustration sparked by what has been a largely underwhelming season, but stopping City from winning a first WSL title since 2016 would at least go some way to tempering the supporters’ angst.",
      "Indeed, even Blues boss Taylor couldn’t find a way to diminish the magnitude of the contest for his side. “Every game is so important because the margin for error is really tight,\" he said in his pre-match press conference on Friday. \"Any kind of dropped point here or there can be quite damaging. We don't underestimate any game. But I probably have to agree (that this is) one of the biggest derbies.\"",
      "And maybe it was the high stakes that contributed to City's subpar start on Saturday afternoon, with United enjoying the best of the early chances in M11. First it was Nikita Parris who came close, drawing a fine save from Khiara Keating, before Brazil international Geyse drilled an effort just wide of the post.",
      "City, though, are always dangerous, even when they are not at their best. And it was Park who fired the first warning shot, taking aim from 25 yards out and forcing Mary Earps to smother the ball to safety.",
      "United still had their moments, most notably when Lucia Garcia's deflected effort had to be tipped over the crossbar by Keating. But City grew in stature with every passing second and took the lead in the 37th minute when Leila Ouhabi teased the ball into the path of Park, who volleyed brilliantly past Earps.",
      "There may have been some justifiable consternation in the United ranks, with replays showing Khadija 'Bunny' Shaw was offside in the build-up. But with no VAR to intervene, the goal stood and, from that moment on, it was hard to imagine the visitors getting back into the game.",
      "And so it proved, as - just minutes after Shaw saw her strike correctly ruled out for offside - Park had made it two, prodding the ball home after Alanna Kennedy's lofted pass into the box. The England international was given a heroes reception as she made her way down the tunnel at half-time, while Taylor turned to give a triumphant fist pump to the crowd.",
      "But the job was not done yet and it quickly became clear City had no intention of taking their foot off the gas in the second half, with Shaw finding the back of the net mere seconds after the restart. The Jamaican, who finished coolly after a perfectly-weighted through ball from Park, had managed to cement herself as City's top-scorer before the VIPs in the Colin Bell stand had even had the time to finish their half-time pies and return to their padded seats.",
      "Hannah Blundell's strike, which deflected off Kerstin Casparij 17 minutes from time, opened the door for the unlikeliest of late United comebacks. However, while Marc Skinner's side enjoyed the lion's share of possession in the final quarter, City's defensive fortitude won out, ensuring the hosts won the day in front of a 40,086-strong crowd.",
      "\"It's always felt like (this could be our year),\" Taylor said when quizzed on the possibility of his side winning the title this term. \"When we started the season, our first game at West Ham was very good and you start to see things the team.",
      "\"Obviously there's a long way from that point to where we are now and full credit to the players and the group behind the group to get us to this position. It's taken a lot of hard work, a lot of trust. The most important thing now... is not to worry too much about anything else and control what we need to control.\"",
      "On Park, the City boss added: \"The cherry on the cake we've been looking for with Jess has been goals and assists and she gave us that today on a big stage. Her performance was good, with and without the ball she drives really well and gives us a lot of energy and a lot of quality.",
      "\"Jess has stepped into the opportunity really well. When you think about how patient she had to be, she's done really well.\"",
      "Certainly, Park will have been delighted to have seen England manager Sarina Wiegman in the stands to take in her exceptional display. With the European Championships to come next summer, the 22-year-old is surely edging ever closer to a starting spot in the Lionesses team. But, if City can carry this momentum into the final run-in, Park and her teammates might just be celebrating a different trophy in a couple of months' time.",

      "Man United Women's boss Marc Skinner has yet to meet the Ineos chief but hopes his arrival could help propel the club to success",
      "Manchester United Women's boss Marc Skinner hopes the arrival of Sir Jim Ratcliffe will be a \"springboard\" for the club's success but says he hasn't yet had the chance to meet the INEOS chief.",
      "Ratcliffe's purchase of a 27.7 per cent stake in United was officially completed last month and he has since outlined his ambitions to restore the Reds to their former glory. Speaking to the media last week, the 71-year-old did not go into any great detail about his plans for the women's team, but admitted, “if it’s a team wearing a Manchester United badge on the shirt then it’s Manchester United and they need to be focused on winning and being successful.”",
      "It is a sentiment that was echoed by Skinner in his pre-match press conference on Friday morning, with the United boss fully aware the next few months will be hugely decisive in deciding his own future at the club. “We (he and Ratcliffe) have not managed to meet yet, I know it’s on the horizon very soon,” he said ahead of this weekend's trip to West Ham United.",
      "“But we have our constant kind of feed through our bosses anyway in terms of kind of how we want to go forwards, what’s going to work and there’s a lot to do. I see it as a real positive move. I think if you know me as a character, my energy is full in, I’m all in, so with my energy, coupled with the fantastic movement of the INEOS investment, I think it’s a real positive moment.",
      "“We have to capitalise on that, we’re going to try to do that, we’re going to put all our behaviours in place for that. It’s hopefully a springboard for everybody to find the success that everybody wants for Man United.”",
      "Ratcliffe first met Erik ten Hag nearly a year ago, while the pair were pictured together at Carrington in January following the completion of the Ineos chief's investment. Sir Dave Brailsford, Ineos sporting director, is currently conducting an extensive audit of all levels at the club and has stepped away from his work with the Ineos Grenadiers cycling team to concentrate on this task.",
      "One of Ratcliffe's first orders of business as part-owner is to decide the best course of action for Old Trafford, with the fanbase currently divided on whether the iconic venue should be renovated or replaced with a brand new stadium. The INEOS boss suggested last week that, should the men's team relocate, Old Trafford could be used to house both the women's and academy teams, who currently play at rugby league ground Leigh Sports Village.",
      "But Skinner admitted such a move is unlikely to happen in the near future. “I’m sure that’s a little bit away,” he said. “We love playing at Leigh Sports Village, it’s become a fortress but obviously it’s a special occasion when you play at Old Trafford.",
      "March's edition of Women's Football News is packed full of exclusive interviews, features and comment on all the big talking points from the WSL and beyond... and you can order your copy HERE",
      "“We’re excited about any of the plans that come. It feels like a real positive movement. Whatever the plans may be, we have to continue to align our positive energy towards that movement. That’s our aim. If it comes down the line and that’s what happens, then I’m sure there will be some fantastic games at the stadium.”",
      "Skinner, who joined the Reds from National Women’s Soccer League (NWSL) side Orlando Pride in 2021, is out of contract this summer and has been under scrutiny this term following a string of disappointing results. United, who finished second in the Women's Super League (WSL) last season and reached the FA Cup final, are currently in fourth place, seven points off a European spot.",
      "However, they will hope to return to winning ways when they travel to the Chigwell Construction Stadium to take on 10th-place West Ham on Sunday.",

      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe has a number of issues to resolve at Old Trafford for both the Men's and Women's sides, and Marc Skinner's team must not be left behind",
      "As the final whistle blew at an overcast Old Trafford on Saturday afternoon, Erik ten Hag cut the figure of a man well-acquainted with the potential repercussions of Manchester United’s 10th Premier League defeat of the season.",
      "Head down, hands in pockets, the Dutchman headed for the tunnel, stopping briefly to offer a customary, consolatory round of applause for the supporters that remained inside the stadium. He wore an air of dejection that mirrored the despondency his counterpart, Manchester United Women's boss Marc Skinner, had exuded during his own commiseratory lap around the pitch at the Emirates Stadium just seven days prior.",
      "In north London, Skinner's side had been thoroughly beaten by title-chasing Arsenal in the Women's Super League (WSL), their hopes of European qualification this term left hanging precariously in the balance. \"I'm here to try and win for Manchester United and to continue to grow the team that's needed to win for Manchester United and I think that's really important,\" Skinner insisted after the game. It was a defiant, determined sentiment not too dissimilar to the one evoked by Ten Hag after Saturday's defeat to Fulham.",
      "\"When we get the injuries back we will be more in balance in the team,\" the Dutchman said. \"We also need to strengthen the squad in the transfer windows and then there are many good players, with high potential coming up. Definitely we are going in the right direction. So when everyone is available we have a very good team.\"",
      "In their respective post-match assessments, both Skinner and Ten Hag seemed to allude to a Manchester United of the future, to two projects still in their infancy and two teams that require patience and time to ensure their potential is fully realised. But, with Sir Jim Ratcliffe now officially installed as the club’s part-owner, time does not appear to be the friend of either manager.",
      "Speaking to the media last week, Ratcliffe remained non-committal on Ten Hag’s future, telling reporters: “I'm not going to comment on Erik ten Hag because I think it would be inappropriate to do that.” It was not exactly a ringing endorsement of the Dutchman who, despite insisting he “doesn’t care” about the growing noise surrounding his United future, will be fully aware of the significance of the coming months and how they might shape the trajectory of his Old Trafford career.",
      "While Ten Hag was also keen to highlight he remains under contract at the club until 2025, Skinner does not have that same luxury. The 40-year-old, who joined United from National Women’s Soccer League (NWSL) side Orlando Pride in 2021, is out of contract this summer.",
      "And though it is understood he is not in immediate danger of losing his job, it is clear the women’s team, too, is at a crossroads as Ratcliffe and co. seek to restore United to a footballing superpower. The INEOS chief did not go into any great detail about his plans for Skinner’s side during his hour-long discussion with the press last week, but it is clear he harbours ambitions of the Reds one day earning a seat at Europe’s top table.",
      "March's edition of Women's Football News is packed full of exclusive interviews, features and comment on all the big talking points from the WSL and beyond... and you can order your copy HERE",
      "“The only thing I would say,” he told those in attendance at his Knightsbridge office, “is that if it’s a team wearing a Manchester United badge on the shirt then it’s Manchester United and they need to be focused on winning and being successful.” It’s worth noting there has already been confirmation of one prominent departure on the Women’s side of operations, with head of Women’s football Polly Bancroft set to take up a position as a chief executive of League Two side Grimsby Town at the end of the current season.",
      "Bancroft was brought in from Brighton & Hove Albion, where she worked as general manager, in October 2022. In her newly-created role at United, Bancroft was tasked with implementing a cohesive strategy for the Women’s first team and academy, overseeing both day-to-day operations and long-term performance.",
      "But, though there have been some successes - chiefly her facilitating of a move to a new state-of-the-art training facility at Carrington - the past 16 months have not always been easy for Bancroft. She was, of course, charged with helping tie down first team stars Alessia Russo and Ona Batlle to new contracts last term.",
      "And, while she was by no means the only figure involved in the handling of those negotiations, the fact Russo and Batlle both left the club last summer - for Arsenal and Barcelona respectively - was viewed in some quarters as a damning indictment of her abilities. Certainly, United will be aware they run the risk of losing yet another of their big names on a free transfer this summer, with goalkeeper Mary Earps also out of contract in June.",
      "The England shot-stopper - who has been voted best goalkeeper in the world for two consecutive years - was the subject of a world-record bid from Arsenal last summer. As they did when the Gunners came calling for Russo in January 2023, United refused to sanction Earps’ exit, though there is every chance she joins her Lionesses teammate in north London in a few months' time, with Paris Saint-Germain and Barcelona also being touted as other possible destinations for the 30-year-old.",
      "Then there are other behind-the-scenes matters to address, with United Women still in the market for a permanent head physio after the former incumbent Ibrahim Kerem moved over to Ten Hag’s side in November. There is also a growing sense the departure of Martin Ho, Skinner’s assistant, last summer has had a detrimental effect on the Women’s team's recent form.",
      "Ho joined Norwegian side SK Brann Kvinner on a two-year deal in July, guiding them to the group stages of the Women’s Champions League and thus making them the first Norwegian outfit in history to achieve that particular feat. And while there is an element of uncertainty about the futures of a number of key United personnel, recent discourse over the future of Old Trafford has also raised questions about the long-term home of the Women’s team.",
      "Skinner’s side currently play at rugby league ground Leigh Sports Village though, with Ratcliffe stating a preference to build a new industry-leading stadium for the men’s team, there seems to be scope for United Women to one day relocate to the club’s spiritual home. “If you use that as a centre of regeneration, a bit like the Olympic Village, then I think what you probably finish up doing is Old Trafford would finish up being reduced in size - in the same footprint but a smaller facility - which can be used for all sorts of community things, be it a concert or whatever,\" Ratcliffe said last week.",
      "\"The ladies teams could play there. The academy teams could play there. Some of the local teams could play there and Old Trafford could sort of become a community asset and then you'd have this world-class stadium next door to it.”",
      "With the 71-year-old's purchase of a 25 per cent stake in United having only been officially ratified by the Premier League and the FA earlier this month, it is clear that only time will bring clarity on several of the club’s myriad unresolved issues. However, with Skinner’s side having so far fallen short in their quest for domestic and European success this term, it is imperative the Women’s team is not left behind as United seek to emerge into Ratcliffe's brave new world.",

      "Man Utd were leading in this game at 99 minutes and 17 seconds - the latest a side has ever led in a Premier League match they have gone on to lose. It is also the second time in less than a week that Man Utd have lost a lead in added time.",

      "Palmer (19) doubled the lead not long after. A clumsy foul from Antony felled Marc Cucurella, with the former Manchester City forward scoring his seventh penalty of the season.",
      "But as has been the case all too often with Chelsea this season, they let a lead crumble. A terrible error from Moises Caicedo allowed Alejandro Garnacho (34) through for the first before Fernandes' (39) free header equalised.",
      "It was a moment of quality from Man Utd that saw them ahead for the first time. Antony's sensational, curling ball was nodded home by Garnacho (67) in front of the ecstatic away fans.",
      "However, as the clock ticked into the eighth minute of added time - the minimum allotted by the fourth official - Chelsea were awarded another spot-kick after Diogo Dalot's foul on Noni Madueke. It was confirmed after a nerve-jangling VAR check, and there was only one man for the job as Palmer scored in almost identical fashion to his first penalty (110).",
      "And there was still time for another as Chelsea overwhelmed a Man Utd defence that had already lost Raphael Varane and Jonny Evans - Varane's replacement - to injury. Palmer's curling effort deflected off Scott McTominay, completing his hat-trick and sealing the Blues' euphoric win.",
      "The result sees Man Utd remain in sixth, nine points behind Tottenham in fifth. Chelsea move up into the top half of the table in 10th place.",
      "After the game, Sky Sports' Jamie Carragher poked fun at his fellow pundit Gary Neville on social media.\n\n\nHe posted 'billion pound bottle jobs' with a crying laughing emoji face after Chelsea's last-gasp win against Neville's former team.\n\n\nIt was a response to Neville's jibe against Chelsea after the Carabao Cup final, when he said on Sky Sports: \"It's Klopp's kids against the billion-pound bottle jobs.\"",
      "Chelsea started the game the better and inside 20 minutes, were 2-0 ahead. The first saw Malo Gusto's cross take a deflection off Varane, before landing kindly to the unmarked Gallagher. It was then a fine strike from the Chelsea captain that flashed through the hands of Andre Onana.",
      "The Blues were awarded a penalty after a clumsy challenge from Antony bought down Cucurella. It was Palmer who waited for Onana to commit before slotting into the right corner for his seventh penalty of the season.",
      "But as we have seen far too many times this season, Chelsea let a lead slip easily through their grasp, and it was a horrible error from Caicedo that allowed Garnacho to level. His squared pass was easily collected by the Man Utd winger before a cool finish past Djorde Petrovic.",
      "Five minutes later, and Man Utd were level. It was a superb ball in from Dalot off the right, with Fernandes waiting towards the back post - unmarked - to head home.",

A sliding Dalot bought down Madueke, with VAR intervening after referee Jarred Gillet pointed to the spot. It was eventually given, and Palmer once again sent Onana the wrong way to secure what looked to be a point for the Blues.",

      "Thursday 4 April 2024 21:29, UK",
      "In his latest column for Sky Sports, Paul Merson says Erik ten Hag could be under severe pressure at Man Utd with poor results against Chelsea and Liverpool this week following a 'shocker' of a performance at Brentford.",
      "Man Utd's performance at Brentford was an absolute shocker. It was a real wake-up call.",
      "A few weeks ago they are beating Liverpool in the FA Cup, getting to semi-finals and everything is great.",
      "They just got destroyed by Brentford and were very lucky to escape with a draw. They made Thomas Frank's team look like Real Madrid.",
      "Now they have got Chelsea on Thursday, and despite Mauricio Pochettino's side's struggles, United could easily lose at Stamford Bridge. Then it's Liverpool at Old Trafford and if United get beat in that one there could be mayhem.",
      "It always goes back to the start with Manchester United. They win a game, they win another. Things look better but then they suffer a bad defeat or put in a horrific performance and we go back to the beginning.",
      "Erik ten Hag always just seems to be able to keep his head above the water with a positive result in among the poor ones. The pattern over the last year has been get beat, lose again, but then get a win against a lesser team at home to keep the critics quiet. It feels like that is what it has been like during Ten Hag's tenure at Old Trafford.",
      "However, this time around, there isn't a game for United to keep the manager's head above water. Chelsea and Liverpool are no free hits. They will have to produce much more than they did at Brentford to win at Stamford Bridge, and even more to beat Liverpool.",
      "Ten Hag hasn't got a gimme this week so the pressure is on.",
      "This is a worrying time for Man Utd.",
      "Ten Hag could be under severe pressure this time next week if they can't get a positive result against either Chelsea or Liverpool. On the other hand, he could be an absolute hero if he can get another result against Liverpool.",
      "I know United can probably point to a few injuries but it is hard to put your finger on what's wrong with them. You watch them sometimes and they can have a 10-15 minute spell in a game and you think, wow.",
      "But then you watch a performance like the one on Saturday and it's unbelievable. You can't believe what you are watching it is that bad.",
      "They are just too open at the back. There's no shape and also no patterns of play.",
      "Any football needs to start from somewhere and you need a base. You need to draw a line and say we'll go from here, but I don't see that from Man Utd. It's hard to see what they are trying to do week on week.",
      "Because it is Man Utd there are many that think of the United of 20 years ago and think they need to go out there and entertain, but this is not the same club at the moment.",
      "So I'd say they've got build from a base, keep it tight at the back and play counter-attacking football again. That's what I thought they were really good at. They were one of the better counter attacking teams around with Marcus Rashford and Alejandro Garnacho hurting the opposition with their pace.",
      "At the moment, when I watch them, it reminds me of the second half of extra-time in a cup game. It's wide open, the game is end-to-end and that's no good for Man Utd. They can't keep playing what I call hope football. They are just hoping for the best and hoping they can grab a win.",
      "That's not good enough for Man Utd.",
      "When Ten Hag was manager at Ajax, he was in charge of the best team. He could just open the game up and say you have a shot, we have a shot. More often than not they had the quality to come through and win 90 per cent of the games.",
      "Is he trying to replicate that at Man Utd?",
      "This is not Ajax and he's not in the Eredivisie now. The Premier League is a different animal and Man Utd aren't a dominant team in the league right now like Ajax were.",
      "He's now got to take a step back and get this team back to where they were last season when they were superb on the counter.",
      "There are also the rumours about who could come in at Manchester United should Ten Hag leave with Gareth Southgate linked to Old Trafford.",
      "Those rumours generally don't come from nowhere. They are coming from somewhere and I didn't see much in the way of anyone denying it. No one seemed to nip it in the bud.",
      "Of course, Southgate is still with England for the Euros and they have a great chance to go a long way at the tournament. But the rumours make me worry for Ten Hag.",
      "However, football is a funny game. Things can change really quickly. A win against Liverpool on Sunday and all the pressure is gone again.",

      "Friday 5 April 2024 09:08, UK",
      "Before Manchester United produced the latest-ever collapse in Premier League history at Chelsea, days after losing a lead in stoppage-time at Brentford, Erik ten Hag appeared to tell Sir Jim Ratcliffe and INEOS not to interrupt his progress at Old Trafford.",
      "Although he did not mention his new bosses by name, it is hard to see who else his words were aimed at. \"We are in a good way, a good direction and we need to make the next steps,\" he said. \"Don't interrupt this process.\"",
      "For the final half an hour at Stamford Bridge, until Cole Palmer's late interventions, Ten Hag on the face of things was delivering on his comments. Had United held on to win, or even draw, it would have only kicked the can further down the road though.",
      "Ten Hag's side are perennially stretched. He says his players should have done their jobs after chaos ensued. You do have to question though why time and again they do not seem to be able to. Something is not right.",
      "Chelsea had 28 shots on Thursday. Brentford had 31 on Saturday. Liverpool had 25 shots before the international break. Ten Hag's system is demanding so much of a group of players that do not suit his high-octane approach.",
      "The Dutchman may need time and another overhaul to achieve the goal he set out earlier this week. His problem, however, is that INEOS may not be so patient. Especially if defeats of this manner continue in the final weeks of the season.",
      "After the game, Sky Sports' Jamie Carragher poked fun at his fellow pundit Gary Neville on social media.\n\n\nHe posted 'billion pound bottle jobs' with a crying laughing emoji face after Chelsea's last-gasp win against Neville's former team.\n\n\nIt was a response to Neville's jibe against Chelsea after the Carabao Cup final, when he said on Sky Sports: \"It's Klopp's kids against the billion-pound bottle jobs.\"",
      "As Jamie Carragher pointed out, United lost in dramatic late fashion to the team named 'The Blue Billion Pound Bottle Jobs'. What does that make Ten Hag's Man Utd?Zinny Boswell",
      "This is the moment Mauricio Pochettino has been waiting for. Many of his comments after disappointing games this season - many Chelsea have thrown away of their own accord - have been about finding the right mentality, working hard and doing so as a team.",
      "Those were all qualities Chelsea showed during their epic, last-gasp 4-3 win. Yes, there were errors, Moises Caicedo's the most glaring. The marking for Bruno Fernandes' equaliser was questionable too. Chelsea were not perfect by any means, but their persistence paid off.",
      "Cole Palmer, too, is looking to be one of the signings of last summer, and is spearheading this new era under Pochettino. He is matching, breaking and creating records every week, and must be the player Chelsea build their future around.",
      "Pochettino's emphatic celebrations after Palmer's winner show just how big this result is. It will do little to boost any league aspirations, but the effect it can have on confidence and performance could be invaluable.",
      "As the manager agrees in its importance, saying: \"It was amazing. We deserved it, we were the better team... For the connection with the fans it is an important day. It should be a turning point.\"",
      "His job now is to harness that feeling and use it to inspire his players going forward. Let's not forget, they have an FA Cup semi-final in a few weeks in a competition that will be their only chance of silverware this season.",
      "But a little revel in such a win before turning to Sheffield United is more than justified. It could be the turning point of Chelsea's season after all.Charlotte Marsh",
      "Alexis Mac Allister to the rescue. Liverpool's title-bid saviour.",
      "The Argentine has been super human of late, with a hand in seven goals in his last six appearances, scoring three and providing four assists.",
      "No contribution has been more keenly felt than his screamer against Sheffield United, with nerves jangling after Conor Bradley's own goal had created unwanted peril.",
      "Mac Allister was the coolest customer on the pitch. His cultured through ball set Mo Salah up for the winner against Brighton at the weekend, and his equally timely strike to pick off the Blades was just as inspired.",
      "The goal felt big and might be remembered as a pivotal moment in this title run-in. This was not Liverpool at their best, but with Mac Allister at the heart, it did not much matter.Laura Hunter",
      "First there was James McAtee failing to convert a close-range golden opportunity 32 seconds in. And then there was Ivo Grbic blasting the ball off Darwin Nunez and into his own net.",
      "As Chris Wilder puffed out his cheeks, you had to feel for the Sheffield United boss, who had already seen his side throw away two-goal leads in their past two Premier League games. The Blades had shot themselves in the foot again.",
      "But credit must go to the Premier League's bottom-placed club for hanging in against Liverpool after those setbacks - and then shocking Anfield with an unlikely equaliser. They had not read the script and gave Liverpool a major scare.",
      "It took Mac Allister's screamer to undo their dogged defence again but while it was ultimately another defeat - and with eight games left and a 10-point gap to make up their survival chances grow ever slimmer - Sheffield United can at least walk away from Anfield with their heads held high.Peter Smith",
      "Rarely does a Premier League game feel like a training session. This was Arsenal at half speed. You sensed with his team selection that Mikel Arteta wanted two key outcomes from this clash with Luton. Rest key limbs and win the game. Tick. Tick.",
      "His boys put on a job-done performance. Declan Rice was rested from the start, while Bukayo Saka was given the night off. Emile Smith Rowe and Reiss Nelson got some important minutes, showcasing that they remain an option for Arteta if required to change a game during a hectic period of fixtures.",
      "Arsenal rarely dazzled in a timid attacking performance, but they were not required to. One goal is enough when you have a centre-back pairing that is able to restrict opposition forwards to such low-quality chances. Arteta told my colleague Nick Wright last week that this Arsenal team \"have a love for defending\" and it was on show yet again.",
      "Luton had scored in their previous 17 Premier League games. They are a hard team to keep quiet. Yet Arsenal restricted them to just five shots, one on target, to a backdrop of expected goals against of just 0.27.",
      "This phenomenal defence has now conceded just three goals in their last nine matches and have conceded just a per 90 average of 0.4 worth of expected goals across their last 10 Premier League games. A remarkable number considering they have played Manchester City and Liverpool in that period. It is a title-winning defence. No question.Lewis Jones",
      "This was stunning from Phil Foden. Two goals from outside the box, including his first Manchester City goal direct from a free-kick, the one from inside the area might have been the most picture perfect of the lot, beautifully placed into the bottom corner.",
      "He was not credited with the assist for the opening goal but he was its architect, splitting the Aston Villa defence to find Jeremy Doku. It was a joy to watch him enjoying himself in that central role and with freedom to burst into the spaces vacated by Julian Alvarez.",
      "Pep Guardiola will be reluctant for the aftermath of this victory to morph into a conversation about whether City are more fluid without their star forward Erling Haaland, dropped to the bench for this 4-1 win. But it is a legitimate topic for debate given the performance.",
      "City have won six and drawn one of the seven Premier League games that Haaland has not started this season. Perhaps even more significantly, given that they win most of the ones he plays too, they have scored at least two goals in each of those seven games.",
      "They average more goals per game without him than with him. And the sight of Foden, Bernardo Silva and Rico Lewis popping the ball around, made it easy to see why. This felt like City close to their best, how a Guardiola team tends to look. With Foden at its heart.Adam Bate",
      "Brighton's inability to keep clean sheets this season has been seen as their Achilles heel in their pursuit of European football again.",
      "But when the dust settles on this campaign if they do finish outside the top seven, or eight, it could be their goalscoring which sees them fall short.",
      "You could easily point to the Seagulls' goals-for column and ask why. They have netted one more than seventh-placed West Ham, and 11 more than Man Utd in sixth.",
      "It is only recently that things have gone south. They scored 18 goals in their first six games. It has taken all of their last 14 matches to reach that same tally.",
      "Defeats have still been few and far between but it does not take an xG model to work out where things need to improve when five of those matches have been 0-0 or 1-1 draws, each against teams they would expect to beat including Brentford on Wednesday night.",
      "Roberto De Zerbi pointed to his players' performance and the 24 shots they racked up at the Gtech. But how many of those would have made a highlights reel?",
      "Losing players like Kaoru Mitoma and Joao Pedro for long periods of the season and Evan Ferguson's drop in form does not help. Brighton do not have the deepest squad in the league by a mile - hence De Zerbi's public call for investment last week.",
      "But he has made his name with attacking football, with or without his star players. And it would be a shame if losing that cost them in the end.Ron Walker",
      "Luton's survival chances will not be decided with results like the 2-0 defeat at Arsenal but - make no mistake - they are in a rut.",
      "For all the plaudits and goodwill in their direction, it is now just one win in 13 Premier League matches, losing seven of their last nine. It would have been nine straight defeats but for two late equalisers vs Crystal Palace and Nottingham Forest. They lost both of those games on the expected goals battle too.",
      "Late goals are a great sign of their never-say-die attitude, yes, but performances are on the wane according to the underlying numbers. In their last five games they have averaged just 0.8 worth of expected goals and conceded 2.1 worth of expected goals against. On current form, that type of expected goals difference calculation ranks them as the worst team in the league - by a distance.",
      "Of course, this can all be caveated with the injury issues. Rob Edwards' squad is decimated and his players are giving everything for the club and its likeable manager. But, to be ruthless, it might not be enough.Lewis Jones",

      "Manchester United are without defenders Lisandro Martinez, Victor Lindelof, Luke Shaw and Tyrell Malacia due to injury; report claimed last month a minority of players concerned Erik ten Hag's training methods have led to injury crisis; Dutchman hits back: \"We don't train too hard\"",
      "Thursday 4 April 2024 21:29, UK",
      "Manchester United boss Erik ten Hag has hit back at suggestions his training methods may be behind the club's injury crisis, insisting they \"don't train too hard\".",
      "United have been besieged by injuries throughout a difficult second season for Ten Hag, with defenders Victor Lindelof and Lisandro Martinez the latest players to pick up issues.",
      "Lindelof is set to be out for at least a month with a hamstring injury picked up in the 1-1 draw at Brentford, while Martinez faces a similar time out after sustaining a calf complaint in training.",
      "The pair's setbacks have raised further questions about United's injury problems this season, with a report last month from the Manchester Evening News claiming a minority of Man Utd players are concerned about the running demands from Ten Hag.",
      "Asked whether his training sessions are too intense, the Dutchman responded: \"No, we don't train too hard. We need to be fit.",
      "\"The standards in this league, you need to be fit, otherwise you can't match the standards that are required in a game. We don't train too hard.\"",
      "Questioned about whether he should have employed a fitness coach, he replied: \"No, we have good departments.",
      "\"We have good people around with a lot of knowledge, based on data and we make our decisions.\"",
      "United have had 30 injuries that have led to one or more games being missed, with only Newcastle having more (32), according to Premier Injuries data.",
      "The Red Devils' ongoing injury crisis comes despite the club set to play fewer games than last season when they played 62 matches in all competitions.",
      "Asked if the injuries are more concerning considering the lighter schedule, Ten Hag replied: \"No, because I know it still has an effect.",
      "\"The huge number of games we had in the last 18 months still has an impact on our squad and the accumulation on the players.\"",
      "He added: \"You need very robust players - that is the requirement.",
      "\"When we were around Christmas with a lot of injuries and then you have to bring them back, but in the moment they are free from injury they are not going to be match fit. They are not straight back into the form, that also needs a couple of games before you get back in the rhythm.",
      "\"I think we have more players who are very robust, as Bruno [Fernandes] is, but that is the type of player you need.\"",
      "United have lost players for a combined 1,136 days this season, the seventh-most in the Premier League, according to Premier Injuries data.",
      "Questioned about his confidence that a similar injury crisis will not happen again next season, the 54-year-old said: \"You can't 100 per cent avoid this. It's impossible. It depends on certain effects.",
      "\"We have national teams five times a year - you give the players away and you don't have any impact. It's not completely true - with some national teams we have very good connections and we manage the programs. But there are others that do what they want and you don't have anything in hand on what they're doing there.\"",
      "Raphael Varane and Jonny Evans look set to bolster Manchester United's beleaguered backline at Chelsea on Thursday.",
      "Ten Hag is hopeful Varane - who went off at half-time in Saturday's draw at Brentford - and recently-injured Evans will be fit for the game at Stamford Bridge.",
      "\"No more issues - we don't need [any more]!\" the United manager said ahead of Thursday's match. \"On the frontline and in midfield we are OK, we have options there.",
      "\"But in the backline we have a lack of options, but the good thing is back in training this afternoon is Raphael Varane and Jonny Evans. And Harry Maguire was already yesterday back in training.\"",
      "Asked if they are any closer to knowing why they are getting so many issues, Ten Hag said: \"Yeah, we have an idea but we will work on that. I think internally we will deal with it.\"",
      "Ten Hag rejected the chance to expand on what that \"idea\" was but was more forthcoming about the strains on top teams right now.",
      "\"You can't prevent,\" the United boss said. \"You see it's not only us who've had this.",
      "\"The standards of the Premier League from an intensity perspective are so high, the overload in the schedule, also international football is so huge.",
      "\"We have all internationals in our squad and you see it's not only us - City, Liverpool and Newcastle have the problems, so there are many other teams.",
      "\"In this moment, especially the defending department, but in the midfield and frontline the players are available.\"",

      "The west London side dominated against Manchester United on Saturday, striking the woodwork four times, but struggled to make their chances pay. It is a tale of Brentford's season, perennially unlucky with both injuries and results.",
      "Poor luck can only justify so much and despite the credit Thomas Frank has accrued he will need that luck to turn around in April with crucial games against Luton and Everton on the horizon.",
      "The first test comes from fellow Liverpool managerial candidate Roberto De Zerbi, whose Brighton side will expose whether Brentford's performance was the first sign of a spring rejuvenation or merely a reflection of United's struggles.Laura Howard",

      "Perfection is required of Manchester City now. Placed third on both points and goal difference following their scoreless draw against Arsenal on Sunday, all Pep Guardiola's side can do is deliver a faultless run-in and pray.",
      "That is easier said than done. Aston Villa presents the toughest test of the Citizens' mettle from the remaining games having come out on top at Villa Park in December. Leon Bailey made the difference on that occasion as City failed to score.",

They are also in search of an immaculate run-in of their own with Tottenham breathing down their necks in the race for fourth place.",

      "On the surface, Sheffield United seem an unthreatening foe. Having conceded 11 in their last three games, the fixture appears more of an opportunity to boost goal difference rather than a threat to Liverpool's title hopes.",
      "The league leaders must not rest on their laurels. Having conceded early to Brighton on Sunday, they have shown they are not infallible. As a clash at Old Trafford against Manchester United at the weekend awaits, Liverpool must maintain momentum to ensure there are no slip-ups along the way.",

      "For all of three minutes on Saturday, Mount appeared to be belatedly living up to his billing as Manchester United's hero. That was until Kristoffer Ajer corked celebrations with a deserved 99th-minute equaliser.",
      "It was another underwhelming United performance in a season which has proved equally underwhelming for the Englishman. Ruled out through injury since November, Mount returned with a cameo in the FA Cup victory over Liverpool touted to kickstart a so far limp season for Erik Ten Hag's side.",
      "While United's boost has not materialised, Mount could be finding his stride. His goal against Brentford was his first of the season and a clash with his former club, who have conceded two in each of their last five matches, presents an opportunity for more.Laura Howard",

      "Manchester United slipped further behind in the race for Champions League qualification after drawing 1-1 at Brentford, with Neville saying they don't deserve a spot ahead of Aston Villa or Tottenham. Man Utd face Chelsea on Thursday - watch free match highlights after full-time",
      "Thursday 4 April 2024 21:29, UK",
      "Manchester United's dismal display in their 1-1 draw with Brentford on Saturday night was \"very worrying\" says Sky Sports pundit Gary Neville.",
      "His former club were dominated by relegation-threatened Brentford for the majority of the contest and even when Mason Mount looked to have delivered a smash-and-grab win with an injury-time goal, United blew their chance of an unlikely victory by conceding in the 99th minute.",
      "The result and performance suggests they will have a huge task on their hands to overhaul Tottenham or Aston Villa in the race for Champions League qualification. They are currently eight points off fifth-placed Tottenham and 11 behind fourth-placed Villa, who have played a game more.",
      "\"I watched Man Utd at Brentford and like everyone else, I couldn't believe what I was watching,\" he said on the Gary Neville Podcast.",
      "\"I thought they would put a bit of pressure on Tottenham and Aston Villa on the run-in.",
      "\"It's actually really difficult to play that badly. Usually, whatever team you play against, even if you are a top team, the other team will have five or 10 minutes of play or a period of domination.",
      "\"I can't remember any point in the game where Man Utd did anything well at all.",
      "\"It was a horrible performance.\"",
      "On the race for a Champions League spot, he added: \"[Aston Villa and Tottenham] will drop points but if you look at United's level of performance, you just think that not only will they struggle to get into that fifth or fourth spot, they don't deserve to at this moment in time with what we are seeing.\"",
      "Most concerning for Neville was the drop-off from United after the feelgood factor of their dramatic FA Cup quarter-final win over Liverpool at Old Trafford before the international break. There was no sign of the intensity that uplifting result may have given them in their performance in west London.",
      "Inconsistency has been a major issue for United throughout the season and Neville highlighted the team's approach out of possession as a big factor.",
      "\"I can't explain that performance. I have no idea where it comes from,\" said Neville. \"It's very worrying that you can go to that level of low.",
      "\"You know you can play badly in football, you know you can have players missing, you know you can miss chances and you know sometimes you don't feel quite right, but that was a dismal, dismal effort in an attempt to play football, in an attempt to work as hard as you possibly can.",
      "\"When Man Utd give the ball away their reaction to giving the ball away is non-existent compared to all the other teams I see. They really are one of the worst teams you can see out of possession in terms of making it difficult for the other team.",
      "\"What we saw from Arsenal at Man City, and you see the levels of defending, compactness and the work ethic of all the front players to be a cohesive unit and defend together, there's none of that at United.",
      "\"I'm not saying the defenders or the midfield players are blameless because they can do a lot better themselves as well, but there's not a unity at all. There's no idea of how to defend and how to play without the ball.",
      "\"It just wasn't very good and there are worrying signs that you can get to that level of low in their performance.",
      "\"You think about where Man Utd were at before the international break, they had one of the most incredible moments [against Liverpool]. They should've been absolutely bouncing into that game at Brentford and yet, we saw what we saw.\"",
      "Man Utd have a tough week ahead, with a trip to Chelsea on Thursday followed by a home Premier League game with Liverpool on Sunday, live on Sky Sports.",
      "However, Neville expects a better effort from United in that reunion with Liverpool.",
      "\"You think about next week and they won't be that bad next week against Liverpool. They can't be that bad,\" he said.",
      "\"But in the game in the FA Cup, Liverpool should have gone and won the game. In the second half they dominated the game.",
      "\"If Liverpool do their jobs next week then Manchester United will be in a lot of trouble.",
      "\"But it will be different. There will be something there, a different feeling and a different spirit.\"",

      "Jamie Redknapp criticised Man Utd's lack of \"desire\" and Erik ten Hag said Brentford \"wanted it more\" after 1-1 draw in Premier League; Bees hit the woodwork four times before Kristoffer Ajer cancelled out Mason Mount's strike in injury time",
      "Sunday 31 March 2024 14:02, UK",
      "Sky Sports' Jamie Redknapp gave Man Utd's performance in the dramatic 1-1 draw at Brentford a scathing assessment and questioned the desire of Erik ten Hag's players.",
      "United looked like they had pulled off a stunning smash-and-grab when Mason Mount scored his first goal for the club six minutes into stoppage time. But Kristoffer Ajer deservedly hit back in the 99th minute to make sure the Bees took something from a game they had dominated.",
      "In all, Brentford had 31 shots, their most ever in a Premier League game. They were only two touches in the Man Utd box away from equalling a Premier League record (Man City's 87). And they hit the woodwork four times.",
      "It was a superb performance from Brentford - who were as good as Man Utd were bad.",
      "After United beat Liverpool in the FA Cup before the international break, this was a big drop off when many expected that Old Trafford victory to be a launchpad for the run-in.",
      "\"Before the game, Thomas Frank would have been a bit nervous thinking, 'We are now going to see a different United. We're going to see a United full of confidence after the result against Liverpool'. It was anything but that,\" said Redknapp.",
      "\"They gave up so much possession, there was a lack of energy with the ball, without the ball. They made Brentford look like Real Madrid!",
      "\"The way Man Utd were was so off it, the lack of desire to go into individual battles, letting them play... It was too easy for Brentford. It was like United at times only had nine men on the pitch.\"",
      "Speaking to Sky Sports after the game, Ten Hag said he felt Brentford's players \"wanted it more\".",
      "\"Maybe we didn't deserve it [the point],\" he said. \"I thought Brentford wanted more in the whole course of the game.",
      "\"In the final third, we were not secure. We were slow. Second balls, defending, we were not good. They were more aggressive. They had more energy and it should be the other way around.\"",
      "Redknapp said that was a poor reflection on the players and Ten Hag.",
      "With speculation about the Dutchman's future rumbling, this was a worrying performance, said the Sky Sports pundit.",
      "\"Ten Hag said they wanted it more. Whenever you hear a manager say that, that's quite damning,\" said Redknapp.",
      "\"He says 'Our way of playing'. I don't know what their way of playing is.",
      "\"I don't know if they play out from the back. They try to do it sometimes and pass it to the keeper and he just lumps it up the pitch. I know they haven't had the back four they'd like [because of injuries] but I don't know what the Man Utd way of playing is.",
      "\"They had so many opportunities today, Brentford. They were better in every single department.",
      "\"There's lots of talk about the [United] manager, will he still be here next year? I think the way the players are playing right now and that kind of performance, they're going to decide.",
      "\"They're the sort of performances that get the manager the sack. There was a lack of effort. If they really like this manager and want to play for him they will do that.",
      "\"I saw so many players strolling around and not looking like they care. They're playing for one of the biggest clubs in the world.\"",
      "Redknapp felt United forward Marcus Rashford epitomised that attitude, saying at half-time he looked like he was \"walking around like it's a bit of fun out there\".",
      "\"Rashford is a player with so much talent,\" said Redknapp at full-time. \"He's got everything - he's got an incredible physique, he can run, he can dribble, he can shoot, he got 30 goals last year... I look at the player right now and he looks like he's not enjoying his football.",
      "\"For me it's quite heart-breaking because they've got so much talent. I want to see more.\"",
      "The result leaves United eight points off fifth-placed Tottenham and 11 off fourth-placed Aston Villa, who have played a game more. With just nine matches left for United, their prospects of grabbing a Champions League qualifying spot seem slim.",
      "\"It's so difficult to predict Man Utd because they're so inconsistent,\" said Redknapp. \"You just don't know what you're going to get.",
      "\"So for you to say they can finish above Tottenham and Aston Villa right now, you can't really make a case for them.\"",
      "Man Utd boss Erik ten Hag: \"If you are winning you shouldn't give it away. We are a strong side and strong in certain situations and we have to get it over the line. That bit is disappointing.",
      "\"We made certain mistakes. We should act differently in a different occasion. The equaliser was absolutely unnecessary. Maybe we didn't deserve it, I thought Brentford wanted more in the whole course of the game.",
      "\"In the final third, we were not secure. We were slow. Second balls, defending, we were not good. They were more aggressive. They had more energy and it should be the other way around.",
      "\"We have many senior players, we should all stand up and take responsibility for this.",
      "\"We will keep fighting, it could be a good point in the end.\"",
      "Manchester United have another date in west London as they go to Chelsea on Thursday evening, kick-off at 8.15pm. Attention then turns to a heavyweight clash with Liverpool at Old Trafford next Sunday, with kick-off at 3.30pm.",
