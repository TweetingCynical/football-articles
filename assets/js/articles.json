      "Tottenham and Manchester United are both said to have cooled their interest in Antoine Semenyo after learning that the sought-after Bournemouth forward would command a transfer fee in excess of £70million.",
      "There has been talk of Semenyo, 25, joining one of the Premier League's top clubs after a stellar season for the Cherries which saw him chalk up 20 goal contributions in all competitions. And it has now emerged that Spurs have followed United in making an enquiry for the Ghana star.",
      "Tottenham want to bolster their frontline ahead of the new campaign and are also interested in Bryan Mbeumo, though the Brentford talisman is understood to favour a move to Old Trafford.",
      "But neither Spurs or United are planning to press ahead with a move for Semenyo as it stands after discovering the forward's price tag.",
      "That's according to The Athletic, who believe that Bournemouth's £70m valuation has 'deterred interest' from Semenyo's suitors after Spurs enquired about the player.",
      "Semenyo would be keen on exploring a move to north London, the report adds, with the club able to offer Champions League football after their triumph in the Europa League final.",
      "While it remains to be seen if Manchester United or Tottenham rekindle talks over a deal for Semenyo in the coming weeks, Bournemouth are in a strong bargaining position when it comes to the forward, who signed a new five-year deal last summer.",
      "They are also under no pressure to raise funds after selling Dean Huijsen to Real Madrid for £50m with Milos Kerkez also poised to join Liverpool for £40m.",
      "With United and Spurs set to consider other attacking targets as a result of Bournemouth's valuation of Semenyo, both clubs are waiting to see if an agreement can be struck with Brentford for Mbeumo.",
      "The Cameroon star is understood to have his heart set on a move to Old Trafford but a move to Tottenham would present him with an opportunity to continue working with Thomas Frank, who was appointed as Ange Postecoglou's successor last week.",

      "Victor Osimhen has previously rejected a move to Manchester United out of respect for one of his compatriots as he claimed he had \"too much respect\" to battle with him for a starting berth.",
      "That was way back in 2020, just before he joined Napoli. It was during his stint with Lille that Osimhen first put himself on the map and his goalscoring exploits made a number of clubs stand up and take note. United were among them, but the Italian side eventually won the race.",
      "Osimhen's refusal to join the Premier League side stemmed from the fact they then had Odion Ighalo on their books. Ole Gunnar Solskjaer raised eyebrows when he went and signed the former Watford man to address the team's attacking issues.",
      "Ighalo had a bright start, but quickly tailed off and his record by the time he left Manchester stood at five goals in 23 games. That said, he was one of the senior Nigerian players of his generation and Osimhen had great respect for the player who was nine years his senior.",
      "The Napoli frontman felt he couldn't compete with his fellow countryman for a starting spot knowing that ultimately one of them would lose out, which motivated his move to Italy.",
      "Osimhen's brother, Andrew, told Complete Sports: \"It is very true that Manchester United wanted Victor, but he told me something like he had too much respect for Odion Ighalo to be competing for shirts with his senior colleague. My brother holds Ighalo in high esteem and he just didn't see himself going to Old Trafford to battle for a striking role with the highest goalscorer at the 2019 AFCON in Egypt.\"",
      "Fast forward five years and Osimhen heading to Manchester could yet materialise. Despite firing Napoli to the Serie A title several years ago the striker is now surplus to requirements whilst Antonio Conte remains at the helm.",
      "He has bought in Romelu Lukaku and backed the Belgian as his leading light in attack. It forced Osimhen to head out on loan last term but he continued to be prolific whilst at Galatasaray. Now back in Italy, he is likely to be sold once a buyer can be found.",
      "Already this summer he has turned down a move to Saudi Arabia, underlining his desire to stay in Europe and ex-United star Rio Ferdinand is among those to endorse a move for the Nigerian.",
      "He said: \"I think if I'm looking at the market now and I had to pick him (Viktor Gyokeres) or Osimhen, I'd probably pick Osimhen because of that experience.\"",

      "There has been plenty of speculation that Martinez, 32, could move on in the coming weeks. The Argentina star was seen in tears after Aston Villa's final home game of the season and there has been talk that the club may need to sell in order to meet Profit and Sustainability Rules.",
      "If Martinez is on the move then the World Cup winner will have no shortage of suitors and United have already been linked with him.",
      "A new report from The Sun now claims that Martinez is 'desperate' to push through a move to United despite the fact that the Red Devils are coming off the back of their worst ever Premier League campaign.",
      "And it's even been suggested that the Villa star has ignored offers from other top clubs in order to remain available for United.",
      "A source told the publication: “Emi is big pals with Argentina team-mate Lisandro Martinez and is keen to move. He has already knocked back a couple of big hitters in the hope of joining United.",
      "“Amorim is a huge admirer of his. He tried to sign him for Sporting in 2020 but lost out to Villa. He wants to fill the squad with captains and leaders and Emi fits the bill perfectly.”",
      "While it's outlined that Ruben Amorim is an admirer of Martinez, who would cost around £40million, the goalkeeping situation at Old Trafford is currently up in the air.",
      "It remains to be seen whether United will actually pursue a new first-choice goalkeeper despite Andre Onana's shaky form since joining the club two years ago. The Cameroon star has, however, been linked with a move to Saudi Arabia and France with reports earlier this week claiming Monaco are now keen to sign him.",
      "There are also doubts over Altay Bayindir, the club's No.2 keeper. But with transfer funds limited and other areas of the squad to strengthen, United may have to cut their cloth accordingly over the coming weeks.",

      "Manchester United endured a dire season, but the caveat throughout the season was that Ruben Amorim didn't have his own players yet. He also hadn't had the benefit of a pre-season, but none of those excuses can be used come August.",
      "The Red Devils, who finished 15th last term, their worst showing since the early 1970s, have wasted no time in pursuing their targets this summer. Not all of them have got over the line, but their show of ambition underlines that they are fully behind Amorim.",
      "Matheus Cunha has been signed from Wolves for £62.5million, but he is the only new face to officially arrive at Old Trafford. Liam Delap was on the club's radar but he ultimately decided Chelsea were a better fit for him.",
      "United's lack of European football doesn't seem as if it will halt their recruitment. A willingness to sell nearly every player in their squad is also set to aid their transfer budget.",
      "Amorim's 3-4-3 system didn't lend itself to the players the Portuguese boss inherited in Manchester and several key positions need addressing. That is before the man in the dugout decides whether those on his books have what it takes to make the club a winning outfit once more.",
      "Cunha is set to play in one of the two roles that sit behind the frontman. Who that will be still needs to be determined. Viktor Gyokeres has flirted with a move but doesn't seem to be keen at present. It is clear that Rasmus Hojlund and Joshua Zirkzee aren't what the team need currently.",
      "United's pursuit of Bryan Mbeumo is well documented. Brentford have rejected their opening offers with Tottenham, who now have Thomas Frank at the helm, hoping they can swoop in and seal a move for the Cameroonian. He's just enjoyed the best year of his career and is tipped to move on, but still favours a switch to Manchester.",
      "He, like Cunha, would likely thrive in one of the positions behind the frontman. Equally though Bruno Fernandes, the club's talisman, has occupied one of those roles but may drop deeper to accommodate all the attacking talent that could be arriving in Manchester.",
      "With Gyokeres favouring other destinations Amorim's search for and out and out striker continues. Scoring goals was a well documented problem for the Red Devils and, after also missing out on Delap, Victor Osimhen could now come into play. The Nigerian's time in Napoli is up.",
      "He was pushed out of loan last term, scoring regularly at Galatasaray, and he's turned down a lucrative move to Saudi Arabia which underlines his desire to remain in Europe. Osimhen has just 12 months left on his deal meaning he could be available for less than his market value.",
      "At the other end of the pitch Andre Onana is still yet to convince despite having two years in between the sticks. He has continued to come up with errors and was even dropped by Amorim last term. Aston Villa's Emi Martinez is a man who is linked with pastures new.",
      "He appeared to say his goodbyes and cut an emotional figure on his last outing at Villa Park. Rumours have mounted that United are keen, and their interest is reciprocated by the Argentina No 1 himself whilst Monaco are understood to be keen on Onana.",
      "In front of the goalkeeper, despite potentially wanting to bolster his defensive line, Amorim may have to stick with what he's got. United ultimately don't have a bottomless pit of cash and if they landed Cunha, Mbeumo, Osimhen and Martinez it would take them beyond the £200m mark.",
      "Those signings could yet be aided by some significant departures with Alejandro Garnacho being among the most significant. Previously cited as a player for the long haul, he has since fallen down the pecking order and his attitude was called into question following his snub in the Europa League final.",
      "Man Utd's possible XI: Martinez; Yoro, Maguire, Martinez; Amad, Ugarte, Fernandes, Dalot; Cunha, Mbeumo, Osimhen.",

      "Liverpool manager Arne Slot is making up for lost time this summer after opening the transfer floodgates at Anfield. And it has taken the Dutchman just a few weeks to break the rule predecessor Jurgen Klopp sought to adhere to above all others in the market.",
      "Klopp, 58, previously made a point of stressing his morals when it came to keeping Liverpool financially solvent. And that meant not necessarily spending on a par with the likes of Manchester City and Manchester United, who copped criticism from the former Reds boss for their free-spending ways in the past.",
      "Of course that changed over time as Liverpool made allowances in opening their chequebook so Klopp could compete. But the German was staunchly against spending £100million fees on individuals when he first arrived at Anfield – a line Liverpool have now crossed with the blockbuster signing of Florian Wirtz from Bayer Leverkusen in a British record deal worth up to £116m, with £100m of that being guaranteed.",
      "\"If you bring one player in for £100m or whatever and he gets injured then it all goes through the chimney,\" Klopp warned back in 2016 after United forked out £89m to re-sign Paul Pogba from Juventus. \"The day that this is football, I’m not in a job any more, because the game is about playing together.",
      "\"That is why somebody invented passes so these players can play together. It’s not about running with the ball because you can do it all the time. Building the group is not my unique idea – it is necessary to be successful in football.",
      "\"Other clubs can go out and spend more money and collect top players, yes. Do I have to do it differently to that? I don’t know exactly how much money we could spend because nobody has told me up to this point, ‘No, no, no you can’t do this.’",
      "\"If I spend money it is because I am trying to build a real team. You can win championships, you can win titles. But maybe there is a manner in which you want it. It is about how it is.\"",
      "The Merseysiders have added 22-year-old Wirtz to their armoury and could have to shell out as much as £116m if certain conditions are met. And that addition means Liverpool have now spent more money in this window than any other in their history to date.",
      "Slot recruited Jeremie Frimpong (also from Leverkusen) for £29.5m earlier in the summer, while goalkeeper Giorgi Mamardashvili has joined from Valencia for an initial £25m, along with £4m in add-ons – with that deal agreed last summer counting towards their 2025 spending. Not only that, but a £40m move for Bournemouth left-back Milos Kerkez is also in the pipeline.",
      "Provided the Kerkez deal goes through as expected, that would take Liverpool's total spend this summer to roughly £215m (providing all bonus clauses are met). And despite the fact the transfer window has been open for less than one month, that would far eclipse the previous record for total spend in any other window.",
      "The closest Klopp came to matching that sum was in the summer of 2018 when he spent around £170m on new signings. That included Alisson from Roma (£65m), Naby Keita from RB Leipzig (£53m), Fabinho from Monaco (£39m) and Xherdan Shaqiri from Stoke (£13.5m), though the investments paid off as they won the Champions League that season.",
      "Eventually, Klopp wasn't too far from overseeing a couple of nine-digit deals himself, considering Liverpool signed Virgil van DIjk and Darwin Nunez for £75m and £85m, respectively. Van Dijk became the most expensive defender in football history at the time of his move from Southampton, and Klopp later walked back his comments concerning exorbitant transfer fees.",
      "\"These kind of things happen. When you want to sign a striker as exciting as Darwin is, that’s the market and you have to pay the price,\" he conceded in 2023. \"I said so many things in my life and life caught me then later and showed me that my imagination was obviously not clear enough for how quickly life can change. That’s how it is.",
      "\"After that [comment about Pogba], we bought a centre-half for quite a decent fee [£75m for Van Dijk], we bought a goalie for quite a decent fee [Alisson]. Our situation is always the same, we try to level it somehow [with sales], the things we invest in the boys and in the players we sell, it’s kind of that it’s not going out of any kind of range and that worked so far, but I know, I heard it immediately.\"",
      "To Slot's credit, he won the Premier League in his debut campaign despite barely spending at all last summer. It's only fair that one, therefore, takes into account that spread of cost, which brings his net spend to a more modest £100m or so per summer window so far."

      "And former United coach Rene Meulensteen reckons Amorim will need to hit the ground running in 2024/25. If not, the Dutch coach believes that his position may be in jeopardy before the end of the year.",
      "\"If things carry on into next season and getting towards Christmas, Ruben Amorim’s job will be on the line,\" Meulensteen told InstantWithdrawalBettingSites. \"The club hierarchy will have no choice but to discuss if he is the right man going forward after how badly last season went – that’s why a good start to the season is a must.\"",
      "Meulensteen suggests that Amorim's rigid style could yet hold the team back, even with the club's activity in the transfer market. The current players linked do not fix all of United's issues in the mind of Alex Ferguson's former assistant.",
      "\"When you're managing Manchester United the target should always be to win the title, but if Ruben Amorim said that now then people would think he is mad,\" he added.",
      "\"If United somehow get to Christmas with only one or two draws and defeats then people might think the club are back, but I can’t see it happening because Amorim is stuck in his system and they are massively vulnerable.",
      "\"I think if United start the season with Andre Onana and Harry Maguire in defence then there will still be a lot of question marks in the unit and other teams will take advantage of that.",
      "\"You can strengthen with Viktor Gyokeres, Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo alongside Bruno Fernandes but the midfield and the defence will still be overrun.",
      "\"The minimum has to be to get back into the Champions League, but Amorim has to be careful because not having an adaptable system is not a clever thing to do. You have to be flexible and be able to adapt when needed.\"",

      "While fans are eager to know if the pair are pals, the Argentinian World Cup winner has now opened up on where he stands with his Portuguese rival. Messi, 37, is still causing waves on the world's stage for Inter Miami, while Ronaldo, 40, now plays for Al Nassr in the Saudi Pro League.",
      "Messi gave a timely reminder of his genius on Thursday, giving Miami their first win the Club World Cup with a breathtaking free-kick against FC Porto.",
      "Afterwards, he discussed his long-term adversary Ronaldo, claiming that they are not actually friends. However, he explained that's only the case as the pair barely get a chance to cross paths.",
      "\"I have a lot of respect and admiration for Cristiano Ronaldo and for the career he's had and continues to have, because he's still competing at the highest level,\" Messi told DSports.",
      "\"The competition with him was on the pitch. Each of us wanted to do the best for our team. Obviously, as always, everything stayed on the field. Off the pitch, we are two normal people. We're not friends obviously because we don't spend time together, but we've always treated each other with a lot of respect.\"",
      "His comments echo his take on the relationship that he made eight years ago. Messi told Spanish outlet Marca in 2017: \"I don't know if we will be [friends]. Friendship is built through spending time together and getting to know each other.",
      "\"We have no relationship, mainly because we only see each other at awards ceremonies and that's the only time we speak. Everything is fine, but our lives don't cross over very often.\"",
      "Does Ronaldo feel the same way? In an interview with Spanish outlet El Chiringuito earlier this year, the ex-Manchester United star claimed he is on good terms with the Miami star due their 'healthy' rivalry – although he has distanced himself from having a friendship with Messi in the recent past.",
      "\"I have a good relationship with Leo Messi,\" said Ronaldo this year. \"I was translating him in English at an award ceremony too! It was funny. It was a healthy rivalry, we got along.\"",
      "However, speaking in 2023, Ronaldo explained: \"I don't see things like that [as a rivalry], the rivalry is gone. It was good, spectators liked it.",
      "\"Those who like Cristiano Ronaldo don't have to hate Messi and vice versa. He's followed his path, and I have followed mine, regardless of playing outside of Europe.",
      "\"The legacy lives on, but I don't see the rivalry like that. We shared the stage many times, it was 15 years. I'm not saying we're friends, I've never had dinner with him, but we're professional colleagues and we respect each other.\"",
      "While the constant debate of just who is the better player, as well as their La Liga battles, have spurred on the question of whether the two are friends - there is another point of contention between the pair: the Ballon d'Or.",
      "Messi has been crowned the winner of the prestigious award eight times, while Ronaldo is his closest challenger on five, which has caused some friction. Yet it seems the iconic duo, while not likely to be spotted dining together any time soon, have put their famous rivalry to one side, for now."

      "Marcus Rashford and Alejandro Garnacho are among four misfits set to be axed from Manchester United’s pre-season tour. The Red Devils are set to travel to the US in July for a clutch of lucrative matches as part of their preparations for the new campaign.",
      "They will take on Premier League rivals West Ham United, Bournemouth and Everton as part of that tour. But Ruben Amorim is set to take a brutal approach to his squad with many stars expected to leave Old Trafford this summer.",
      "According to The Sun, four out-of-favour stars are set to be left behind at Carrington for the tour should they fail to seal moves away from United before then. That includes academy graduate Rashford after Aston Villa turned down the chance to sign him permanently following his loan spell.",
      "The forward has since been linked with Barcelona. He is set to be joined by Jadon Sancho after he too saw a permanent move to Chelsea collapse following a loan spell last season.",
      "Napoli have since emerged for his services but are struggling to afford his wages as it stands. Alejandro Garnacho also faces little prospect of a future at United - the Argentine having also been linked with Napoli.",
      "The final player that Amorim wants to leave behind is Antony. The Brazilian winger has struggled since his big-money move from Ajax and while he impressed with Real Betis last term, the Spanish side are yet to make a renewed move.",
      "Explaining Amorim’s hardline stance, a source quoted by The Sun said: “Amorim is stamping his authority on the club. It was hard arriving mid-season but he now has the opportunity to shape the team in his image. And he’s wasting no time.",
      "“He only wants players who would die for the shirt and are on board with his ideas. He also wants a smaller squad to create an intimate team bond so that everyone gets enough game time to be at peak fitness when called upon. He doesn’t want any bad apples or distractions.”",
      "While Amorim is set to axe a few faces from his squad for United’s pre-season commitments, there could also be a few new additions to the squad. Matheus Cunha is due to join up with the Red Devils following his £62.5m move from Wolves.",
      "He could yet be joined by Bryan Mbeumo, who remains at the heart of a tug of war between United and Tottenham. As it stands, he favours a move to Old Trafford but United chiefs are yet to agree terms with the Bees over the Cameroon forward.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more."

      "Brentford have sent Manchester United fans into a Bryan Mbeumo-themed transfer frenzy with some naughty social media hijinx. The Cameroon forward is of interest to both Manchester United and Tottenham this season following a sensational season last time out.",
      "He is thought to favour a move to Old Trafford but a reunion with his former Brentford boss Thomas Frank is on the cards in North London. And while his future is yet to be fully decided, the Bees social media team have allowed themselves to have a bit of fun.",
      "They shared a two-minute long video on Twitter on Thursday afternoon showing every Premier League goal that Mbeumo had scored last season. Of course, the 26-year-old enjoyed a stunning campaign as he plundered 20 goals for the Bees - something that has likely triggered interest in his services.",
      "Some Red Devils fans even suggested that a transfer could be imminent after watching the video. One fan said: “Farewell comp?” While another added: “Time to let him go, gents.” A final fan replied: \"We will love to see this at Old Trafford.\"",
      "Mbeumo has already broken his silence on his future having admitted he was slightly unprepared for the furore around a transfer, albeit was taking it in his stride. He said: \"It (transfer speculation) is a bit new for me I would say! I think it can be the life of a footballer, and you need to accept it.",
      "\"It's been my best season so far in the Premier League. And even collectively, I think we did play very good games. I think we've been unlucky to chase the Europe spot, but I think it's been a fantastic season.\"",
      "One man who needs no reminder of Mbeumo’s abilities will surely be former Brentford boss Frank. Speaking during his time in West London, he warned any interested sides that they would have to dig deep into their pockets to afford him - words that could now come back to bite him having moved to Spurs.",
      "\"It is clear that if he is to be sold, it must be for a nice, nice amount,\" Frank said. \"It is a lot. Mucho. Really a lot.",
      "\"Then it is clear that it is impossible to replace him one for one. It cannot be done. There is a reason why he costs x number of million pounds, and we do not have x number of million pounds to buy for.",
      "\"I would say that I would be surprised if a lot of big clubs don’t look at him. I would be surprised with what he has to offer.",
      "“How many wingers score 20 goals for a mid-table club? And then with seven assists plus his work ethic. And his character. All these things mean that he has a lot, so he is a good player.\"",

      "Viktor Gyokeres has reportedly decided to reject a lucrative contract offer from Juventus, with the striker preferring a move to Arsenal. Gyokeres is one of the most in-demand footballers in Europe right now, having fired Sporting Lisbon to the double last season.",
      "The 27-year-old scored 54 goals in 52 appearances across all competitions as Sporting won the Primeira Liga and Taca de Portugal. Arsenal, Manchester United and Juventus have all been heavily linked with Gyokeres, but it appears the player has his heart set on a move to the Emirates.",
      "It emerged earlier this month that Juventus were ready to offer Gyokeres a stunning £11m-per-year deal to try and persuade him to snub a Premier League move in favour of a switch to Serie A.",
      "However, Corriere dello Sport are now reporting that Juventus have been informed that Gyokeres only wants to join Arsenal this summer. The news comes amid a public spat between Gyokeres' agent and Sporting over a supposed 'gentleman's agreement'.",
      "Gyokeres has an £85million release clause, but his agent has claimed he reached an agreement with the club last season that they would accept bids in the region of £60m. However, Sporting president Frederico Varandas has insisted that is not the case.",
      "\"One thing you should already know is me better,\" said Varandas, per Record. \"Threats, blackmail and insults don't work with me. I can guarantee that Viktor Gyokeres will not leave for €60m+10m (£51m+£8.5m) because I never promised him that.",
      "\"This game that the agent is playing only makes the situation worse. To this day, Sporting has not had an offer for Viktor Gyokeres, neither today nor last season. I think it's fair to explain the whole process.",
      "\"The process started last year when the season ended, Sporting were champions and had a fantastic season. During the transfer window we realised that Viktor was going to stay at Sporting because we didn't receive a single offer for him.",
      "\"When the season started, the agent approached Hugo Viana several times, asking if we could add an extra fee to the contract if he scored 'x' goals; I gave Viana the opportunity to negotiate, within reason.",
      "\"Viana manages the relationship with the agents, and very well, this is done by the sporting director. One of the agent's biggest concerns was whether we would demand the value of the €100m (£85m) clause next year.",
      "\"Viana negotiated with the agents over several meetings, until the agent himself asked for the president's presence to settle the matter once and for all. The issue of the bonus for 'x' goals seemed reasonable and at that meeting, where the president, the agent and Viana were present, no player was present, Viktor was not present, the agent wanted to guarantee certain things.\"",

      "Signing the best player from Wolves should never be billed as a 'statement signing' by Manchester United but there was a statement of intent with the quick conclusion of the Matheus Cunha deal.",
      "Cunha's release clause, the Portuguese coterie at United and Ruben Amorim's system made the Brazilian playmaker an obviously attractive target. After Wolves won at Old Trafford on Easter Sunday, the swiftness with which United moved for Cunha meant it would have been a surprise if he had not ended up in their shirt.",
      "Buying Premier League quality also laid down a marker. After the world record £80million United parted with to buy Harry Maguire in 2019, they bought one player from a Premier League side (Mason Mount) before this calendar year.",
      "Cunha is a specialist No.10 and an upgrade on United's existing options, bar Bruno Fernandes. Fernandes could be relocated to central midfield if he remains at United beyond the closure of the transfer window.",
      "Sources at United spoke about the desire to come out of the blocks in the window. Ideally, they would have two new forwards in the building but Liam Delap chose Chelsea. Minutes after Delap's decision had been reported, United staff in Hong Kong were in a relaxed mood and stressing there were contingency targets.",
      "United's season, with 44 league goals and a -10 goal difference, demanded swift action in the market. Now their priority is Bryan Mbeumo, another forward who outscored Cunha with a remarkable 20 league goals last term.",
      "Mbeumo represents the best of both worlds. He can switch from attacker to defender, given his experience on the right wing in Brentford's back-three system. His natural skill set is of an attacker, though. Mbeumo was amused to discover he was listed as a midfielder in the Fantasy Premier League last season.",
      "The looming 'deadline' of June 30 - the end of the financial year - and the rejection of United's opening offer of up to £55m for Mbeumo has caused activity to slow down. Deals were practically done for Joshua Zirkzee and Leny Yoro in early July last year and there is bound to be movement next month.",
      "United leave for their pre-season tour of the United States on July 22 - four weeks on Tuesday. Before that, their friendly schedule begins against Leeds United in Norway (again) on July 19. United are still guarded as to the official return date for their players but the week beginning July 7 would be logical (it was July 8 last year).",
      "In previous summers, United have finalised signings after the start of the pre-season tour only to welcome new players at their base. Sergio Romero, Fred and Andre Onana flew to the United States in 2015, 2018 and 2023. United decided not to summon Christian Eriksen to Australia in 2022.",
      "This summer is a rarity in that there is no international tournament. After the 2026 World Cup, another Africa Cup of Nations is scheduled for summer 2027, then is the European Championship and the Copa America in 2028.",
      "Having Cunha and Mbeumo in Chicago would be another statement."

      "The wall of the Manchester United academy gym at Carrington may be in need of a revamp. It is adorned by Scott McTominay, Marcus Rashford and Alejandro Garnacho.",
      "Tom Heaton is also on it. At the time of the interior decoration, all four were United first team squad members. Three still are, technically, but Heaton is likely to be the only one remaining come the end of summer.",
      "In the main building, there are young and old images of past graduates. Dean Henderson is one of the most recent, a success story for the United academy but not at United.",
      "United's outgoing academy director Nick Cox celebrated Henderson's man-of-the-match performance in the FA Cup final on X. Henderson was, briefly, United's first homegrown No.1 since Gary Walsh. The chances of an academy talent making the grade at United are more remote than for those in any other position.",
      "Manchester United have launched their new home kit for the 2025/26 season with an Adidas shirt paying tribute to Old Trafford.",
      "Fans can order their Men's, Women's and Kid's shirt today.",
      "£85",
      "Cox always accepted goalkeepers were a conundrum. Enough were needed to play, train and cover the first team, so a minimum of six were needed in the junior teams. United relish emergency loan calls from clubs for goalkeepers as Henderson's first career appearance was as an emergency loanee at non-league Stockport County in 2016.",
      "The image of Henderson can still motivate the incumbent academy custodians. Henderson has won the FA Cup, will be playing in Europe next season and there are whispers he could supplant Jordan Pickford as the England No.1.",
      "\"We take great pride in seeing our boys have great careers away from here,\" Cox said. \"If we hinged everything on who crosses the white line (for United), we'd all be miserable.\"",
      "Cox's work at United is done and he will move to Everton as their technical director later this year. “Nick has made a huge contribution to Manchester United over the past nine years,\" United's director of football Jason Wilcox said. \"I was already well aware of his qualities before I arrived at the club and have really enjoyed working together.",
      "“Identifying and developing the best youth talent remains one of this club’s top priorities, and we are grateful for the work Nick has done to provide such a strong foundation for us to continue to build on.\"",
      "2019, the year that Henderson became a Premier League player with Sheffield United, coincided with Cox's appointment as head of the United academy. Nicky Butt assumed the role of head of first team development and both made invaluable contributions to reviving one of the most important sectors at United.",
      "In the years after Sir Alex Ferguson's retirement, the academy was neglected. Following Brian McClair's departure in 2015, there was no full-time academy head for a year. Instead, it was jointly run by the club secretary John Alexander and John Murtough, long before he assumed the prominent post of football director in 2021.",
      "United were thrashed 5-1 by Chelsea, in the midst of monopolising the FA Youth Cup, in January 2016. Louis van Gaal watched Marcus Rashford from the stands at Altrincham a month before Rashford's stratospheric start to his professional career.",
      "That under 18 side also endured a 12-match losing run. Later that year, United's under 14s were annihilated 9-0 by Manchester City. There was uproar in Northern Ireland when United did not participate in the Milk Cup in 2015.",
      "The academy's reputation was buttressed at senior level by the breakthroughs of Rashford and Jesse Lingard, the 2016 FA Cup final matchwinner. Van Gaal handed debuts to 12 academy players, the majority of them undeserved or utterly unforeseen. Paddy McNair and Cameron Borthwick-Jackson had brief purple patches that gave the illusion the academy was in ship-shape.",
      "It wasn't until Butt returned to United to head the academy in February 2016. He oversaw an aggressive recruitment drive in the close season with Tahith Chong, Lee O'Connor, Nishan Burkart, Joshua Bohui and Millen Baars. None became United mainstays but a marker was laid down.",
      "After his promotion to the first team coaching staff by Jose Mourinho in 2018, some players found McKenna to be akin to a school teacher. His success at Ipswich Town is evidence that McKenna had the mettle to manage adults but his avuncular streak was apparent when he supported a nervous Gomes, aged 16, during a live televised interview with MUTV at the player of the year awards.",
      "Mourinho despaired at some of the players in the relegated under 21 side in 2018. \"Roshaun Williams, f*****g hell,\" he scoffed to a confidant. For Mourinho's final pre-season tour, Greenwood, Garner and Gomes were all included in the squad to usher in the more promising contingent.",
      "Cox ramped up United's overseas recruitment. Hannibal Mejbri cost £9m from Monaco in 2019, a year before United raided Barcelona, Real Madrid and Atletico Madrid for Marc Jurado, Alvaro Fernandez and Alejandro Garnacho.",
      "The European intake was never driven by Brexit, according to Cox. Jurado, Fernandez and Garnacho filled gaps at academy level to support the first team and all just happened to all be based in Spain, was his version of events.",
      "Fernandez is another United academy success story but one that got away from the first team. Garnacho's United career seems certain to end prematurely after five years yet he will be fondly remembered for his FA Youth Cup and FA Cup final winning goals.",
      "Cox coaxed Garnacho from Atletico Madrid to United via Zoom calls and the aid of an interpreter from his spare bedroom during lockdown in 2020. He wryly recalled his sons, aged 14 and 10 at the time, arguing outside over their X Box.",
      "Mark Dempsey, the academy coach brought back to United by Ole Gunnar Solskjaer in 2018, likened Garnacho to Peter Barnes, an old teammate during his fleeting playing career at United. Garnacho ended up ousting Rashford and has been bracketed with more celebrated United wingers.",
      "\"Only at 50 or 100 games can you start to think they might have cracked it,\" Cox once said. It could be 144 and out from Garnacho.",
      "Domestically, United bought Joe Hugill amid competition from Arsenal and Tottenham Hotspur in 2020. Charlie McNeill also made headlines as he defected from City for £750,000.",
      "United's academy fell behind City's for several years, which made the McNeill deal such a coup. McNeill started out at the United academy before he was lured to City in 2014. City offered to put McNeill's siblings in St Bede's College.",
      "More significantly in 2014, City opened the City Football Academy. United sources accept their own training complex at Carrington is no longer fit for purpose, though their new first team building is due to be finished later this summer.",
      "Darren Fletcher's sons, Jack and Tyler, spent nine years in the City academy before their homecoming at United in 2014. Both are youth internationals, one for England and one for Scotland. United considered City's simultaneous approach for Harrison Parker to be a \"revenge move\" after the deal for the Fletchers.",
      "Kobbie Mainoo, born in a City stronghold in Stockport, is another graduate who United figures feel highlights the academy's revival. Those who know Mainoo believe he would have gone to City at youth level had United's academy not been overhauled by Butt and Cox.",
      "United's domestic recruitment has had to become more intense since Brexit regulations prevented English clubs from signing under- 8s from overseas. The Fletcher twins, Harry Amass and Chido Obi have all been involved with the first team. Toby Collyer and Ethan Ennis joined from Brighton and Liverpool in 2022. United include Ayden Heaven, a £1.5million signing from Arsenal's academy, among them.",
      "Cox was saddened by Brexit blocking United from assembling more multicultural squads. He felt United's ethos always had a blend of local lads and overseas recruits. The Youth Cup winners in 2022 had a Czech, a Norwegian and two Spaniards in the starting XI.",
      "Maxi Oyedele, born in Salford and now at Legia Warsaw, has already played for the Poland national side and is generating notable interest. Zach Baumann, from Bolton, has played for the Ukraine youth team.",
      "With a predominantly British squad, United secured a triple-crown success in 2023-24. The only blemish was on the night they froze in a surprising Youth Cup loss at Swindon Town.",
      "In February 2020, United reached the Youth Cup semi-finals for the first time in eight years. It was not a vintage squad and Mejbri, with 13 appearances, had the most first-team exposure. It nevertheless represented another progressive stride.",
      "A potent youth team underachieved in the competition the next year, losing 1-0 to Liverpool at Leigh Sports Village, before the glory in 2022. The final, staged at Old Trafford, set a new record for a Youth Cup attendance as 67,492 clicked through the turnstiles.",
      "Cox was never going to allow that triumph to define the academy. His role was so broad he restructured the coaching staff, rebuilt the sports science team, considered psychological support, redeveloped the performance analysis team and built a life skills programme.",
      "His responsibilities evolved significantly, segueing from effectively a dual-role with Butt. Cox also sensibly downplayed the presence of youngsters training with the first team, attempting to counter the hype and provide context for their temporary promotions.",
      "No, it did not mean they were primed to be the next superstar. It is often owed to first team injuries, recovery days or international commitments. It was different when Garnacho missed the Youth Cup final media day at the academy building as Ralf Rangnick deemed him worthy of senior squad status.",
      "Tyrell Warren was one of the first academy players to be namechecked by Mourinho after he took over at United. A former academy teammate of Rashford's, he is now at Grimsby Town in League Two yet the Mancunian remains a shining example of the United academy.",
      "Cox attended United's EFL Trophy match with Barrow in 2022, flanked by Tony Whelan, Dave Bushell and Eamon Mulvey, stalwarts of the United youth set-up. Darren Fletcher was also present at Holker Street.",
      "Before kick-off, Warren and Adam Temple, a former United academy coach, entered the boardroom for a catch-up. \"That's a classy Manchester United thing to do,\" Cox enthused. \"Because they've been brought up that way. In that they come to welcome us to talk about how their season's going. And you sit there and you go, 'that is youth development in a nutshell'.",
      "\"A young lad that's been through your programme that is absolutely maxing out, he has reached his full potential. He's earning a living in the game.\"",
      "Warren has since moved to Grimsby Town, seven places better off than Barrow last season. He had not hit a wall."

The 81 points United amassed in 2017-18 remain their most in a single campaign since the 2012-13 title win.",

After the Europa League group stage defeat to Fenerbahce at the start of November, United lost one of their next 28 matches - a League Cup semi-final second leg reverse at Hull City in which they still progressed to the final.",
      "Mourinho recalled Carrick for United's next game after Fenerbahce, a 3-1 victory away to Swansea City. In December and January, United embarked on a nine-game winning run and Carrick started in six as he was rested for the other three.",
      "Carrick was added to Mourinho's coaching staff after he retired from playing in May 2018 and he spent six months in the dugout before the Portuguese was sacked in December 2018.",
      "United beat Tottenham three times and Arsenal, Chelsea and Manchester City twice under Mourinho. They were unbeaten in four games against Liverpool until a 3-1 defeat in Mourinho's final match in charge at Anfield while there was a memorable 2-1 victory at Juventus in the Champions League a month earlier.",
      "“He was hungry to win,\" Carrick said of Mourinho, \"which is a pretty obvious thing to say. He was his own man and he knew how to win big games. That was his biggest asset.\"",

      "A solid start to the window, but the centre forward problem remains.",

And that is to be expected, with June 30 representing the final day of the financial year in the Premier League. Plenty of clubs will be waiting for that date to pass before looking to make further signings.",

Cunha and Mbeumo scored a combined total of 35 Premier League goals last season, just nine short of United's tally of 44.",

      "Hello and welcome back to the Manchester United transfer blog on Saturday, June 21.",
      "With Matheus Cunha already through the door, United are facing a crucial period over the next few weeks to sign more players. Bryan Mbeumo is a key target with the Brentford man seemingly set to decide on a move to Old Trafford or Tottenham.",
      "A move for a striker is expected to follow after the Mbeumo deal is wrapped up but there has been talk of United replacing Andre Onana in goal. AS Monaco have reportedly offered the United No.1 an escape route out of Manchester with Aston Villa's Emiliano Martinez lined-up to replace him.",
      "In the past 24 hours, a number of updates have emerged regarding the future of Marcus Rashford and Jadon Sancho. Rashford's dream move to Barcelona seems to be off with Nico Williams set to move to the Nou Camp while clubs in Italy are lining-up a move for Sancho.",
      "With this in mind, keep across all the latest United transfer news and updates below:",
      "Christian Falk has claimed that Man United target Joao Palhinha is keen to find out if Bayern Munich plan to use him this season.",
      "Reports have stated that United and Fulham are interested in bringing the Portugal international back to England. Speaking to CFBayern Insider, Falk said: \"Palhinha wants to talk with Kompany and Eberl, if he will have a chance for the next season.",
      "\"The club’s view is that they want to sell him. His prize tag will around £30m. Eberl returned to Europe from Bayern’s camp in the States to focus on transfers.”",
      "Marcus Rashford has initiated contact with Barcelona once again in hope of landing a move to the La Liga champions.",
      "Tot Costa of Catalunya Radio has claimed that Rashford's entourage have made fresh contract with Deco to reiterate his eagerness to join and willingness to remain patient over the transfer window.",
      "The report adds that Barca are open to signing Rashford, but only under the right conditions.",
      "Cesc Fabregas' Como have attempted to sign Antony this summer but the Brazilian's desire to return to Real Betis have delayed their pursuit.",
      "According to Fabrizio Romano, Como want to bring the winger to the Serie A but Antony's preference is to return to Spain. Betis are said to be attempting every possible route to get a deal agreed with United.",
      "Man United are not ruling out a move for Porto goalkeeper Diogo Costa this summer, according to reports in Portugal.",
      "Journalist Sebastiao Sousa-Pinto has reported that Costa is United's goalkeeping priority despite reports linking them with other targets. He wrote on X:",
      "\"As I have been reporting in recent weeks, Diogo Costa remains on Manchester United’s list to fill the goalkeeper position. The price tag could be an obstacle for the Red Devils. He has been Ruben Amorim’s favourite since January, but there are other options on the table if Onana leaves.”",
      "Jadon Sancho reportedly prefers a move to Napoli over Juventus this summer, according to Italian journalist Gianluca Di Marzio.",
      "It's claimed that Juventus have made a bid worth €25m for Sancho but the forward has agreed to join Scott McTominay in Naples. However, the Serie A champions are yet to submit an official bid.",
      "Dusan Vlahovic would become one of Man United's highest earners if he moves to the club this summer.",
      "GIVEMESPORT have claimed that the Juventus star is seeking a lucrative contract with a wage of around £200,000-per-week demanded.",
      "Vlahovic is set to reject a contract offer by Juve.",
      "More on Andre Onana here with Italian journalist Gianluca Di Marzio reporting that Atalanta's Marco Carnesecchi is among the list of replacements.",
      "Emi Martinez continues to be a strong candidate but Di Marzio has claimed that the Italian is admired by United.",
      "AS Monaco are reportedly exploring the possibility of offering Andre Onana an escape route out of Manchester United.",
      "French outlet L'Equipe have claimed that Monaco are looking to add a new shot-stopper to their squad to upgrade on their current options Radoslaw Madecki and Philipp Kohn.",
      "Chelsea's Djordje Petrovic is also on their radar.",
      "More from ESPN's report on Rashford and more clarity on what teams are interested in the United star has emerged.",
      "The story claims that Barcelona, Inter Milan, Juventus, Bayern Munich and 'several' Premier League clubs are all interested in signing the forward.",
      "Marcus Rashford is planning to return to Man United training next month if a deal to leave the club isn't agreed, according to ESPN.",
      "A firm bid is yet to be received and as things stand, the 27-year-old will report back to Carrington. ESPN have reported that Ruben Amorim is yet to make a decision about whether Rashford, Antony, Alejandro Garnacho or Jadon Sancho will be part of his squad for the summer tour of the United States.",
      "Jadon Sancho is prepared to settle for a move to Italy after Chelsea decided not to buy him with Napoli reputedly keen on Sancho, having had a £40m bid rejected for fellow United winger Alejandro Garnacho in January.",
      "Sancho is out of contract at United next year and the club is seeking a fee similar to the one Chelsea originally agreed to pay, despite Sancho's underwhelming campaign in west London.",
      "United and Napoli have a productive relationship following the sale of Scott McTominay last summer and Napoli coach Antonio Conte has form for bringing players from the Premier League to Serie A.",
      "Manchester United are preparing for the possibility of sending Marcus Rashford out on loan for the entirety of next season.",
      "Rashford, 27, wants to join a Champions League club and has not entertained a potentially lucrative move to Saudi Arabia or Turkey and United sources believe there is a low possibility that a suitable bidder will come in for the £40million-rated forward.",
      "Inter Milan tentatively enquired about Rashford when they expressed interest in Rasmus Hojlund earlier this month but the Champions League finalists would only consider a loan deal.",
      "Antony is prepared to take a 30 per cent wage cut to leave Manchester United in this summer's transfer window, boosting Real Betis' chances of re-signing the winger.",
      "Spanish giants Real Madrid have been offered the chance to sign Marcus Rashford this summer, according to reports in Spain.",
      "Defensacentral report that United have approached Real Madrid over the possibility of signing Rashford. It is claimed that United are worried over Barcelona's interest, given their financial problems.",
      "Hello and welcome to our brand new Man United transfer blog!",
      "Plenty to dig your teeth into on this Saturday morning following a week full of twists and turns. We'll bring you the latest on United's hunt for a new attacker, the goalkeeper predicament and exits."

      "Left-back has been a problem position for a number of years for Manchester United.",
      "Luke Shaw's constant injury issues mean he can't be relied on, with Diogo Dalot and Noussair Mazraoui having to fill in on the left at times last season. The club will hope Patrick Dorgu can make the position his own for years to come, but at just 20 he still has a lot to learn.",
      "For a few weeks at the start of the 2022/23 season, United looked to have uncovered a gem in Tyrell Malacia. The Dutchman was brought to the club by Erik ten Hag and looked a steal at £12.9m following some very solid showings. But the wheels soon came off.",
      "Malacia struggled to nail down a spot in the starting XI and suffered a tear in his left meniscus towards the end of the 2022/23 season. After undergoing surgery in the summer, he would soon suffer an inflammation around the affected knee and had to undergo yet another surgery.",
      "\"I had to start my rehab over, basically,\" he said of the injury. \"I had one day to be disappointed and then I had to be like, 'OK, we go again'.",
      "\"At the end of the day, we want to do everything right, at the right time. Maybe it went a little bit too quickly before, so we've learned from that.\"",
      "After a gruelling 18 months, Malacia finally returned to action in November 2024 before being shipped out on loan to PSV Eindhoven in the winter transfer window. Having struggled to impress during his time with United and following the signing of Dorgu in the same window Malacia joined PSV, it's clear the Dutchman is set for a permanent exit from the club this summer.",
      "Malacia penned a four-year deal when he arrived at United, meaning the club must sell him for £3.22m to avoid making a loss on him under the league's profitability and sustainability rules.",
      "Transfermarkt values Malacia at €8m (£7m), and if United can offload him for that fee they can be pleased with their work given his lack of game time over the last few seasons.",
      "United need to sell players to fund further incomings this summer and selling Malacia for £7m would offer a timely boost."

      "Rasmus Hojlund's arrival at Manchester United for a fee rising to £72m was always going to be a gamble. And it's a gamble that has backfired massively.",
      "The callow striker enjoyed a respectable first season at Old Trafford, scoring 16 goals in all competitions. But his second term at the club has been one of regression and frustration, with Hojlund scoring a paltry four league goals as United limped to a dire 15th-place finish.",
      "We also asked readers which position they want the club to prioritise strengthening if a deal for Bryan Mbeumo is completed. Unsurprisingly, 59% of people want a striker to be the priority.",
      "26% think a new goalkeeper should be top of the wish list, with just 8% of readers thinking a central midfielder should be prioritised. The other options on the survey were centre-back (2%), wing-back (1%) and attacking midfield (4%)."

      "This time next year Ewan Sharp will be at the centre of an historic World Cup.",
      "He could even come up against a few familiar faces from his Manchester United days - perhaps a meeting with Portugal's Cristiano Ronaldo and Bruno Fernandes, or facing off against his mentor Ralf Rangnick, now in charge of Austria.",
      "Sharp spent a year at Old Trafford, working alongside Rangnick, and is now part of the coaching staff at Canada, who are co-hosts for next summer's World Cup.",
      "Right now the Canadians are involved in the Gold Cup and face Curaçao in their second group game tonight having eased past Honduras 6-0 in their opener.",
      "Canada, managed by former Leeds United boss Jesse Marsch, are one of the favourites for the tournament alongside their co-hosts USA and Mexico. Sharp, 32, will hope this summer brings success and that the formula can be repeated on the world stage in 12 months' time.",
      "\"The Gold Cup in a lot of ways replicates the World Cup and we want to use that as a learning and an experience. I think in the last year we have learned a lot about our players and our group and the squad depth is improving.\"",
      "Sharp's role within the staff set-up is a hybrid of analysis and on-pitch coaching. It's one he relishes with his background in video analysis lending itself to an analytical role while his desire to one day be a manager means he relishes the coaching aspect.",
      "\"Day to day I am involved in scouting our players, watching their matches, looking at players we should consider calling in, looking at our core guys,\" Sharp explains.",
      "\"As well as being responsible for the opposition match planning and prep and thinking about ways in which we can play against them.",
      "\"In camp, a lot of that prep work is done, so I am a bit more free to help with training planning and coaching and working with individual players.\"",
      "Sharp's rise to the role started in the Red Bull organisation, where he first met Marsch and also Rangnick. It was the German who took Sharp to United.",
      "It was one of many difficult periods in United's recent history with the club having axed Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and, unsure of where to go next, turned to Rangnick and his team as an interim option.",
      "An initial honeymoon period saw United beaten just twice in 17 games - albeit one was a penalty shoot out defeat to Middlesbrough in the FA Cup - but after a derby day thumping at Manchester City and a Champions League exit to Atletico Madrid and with qualification for next season's elite competition slipping away, the wheels came off. United won just three times in their final 14 matches. A deal to bring Erik ten Hag in for the following campaign was announced in April and Sharp admits it became a tough sell for the coaching staff.",
      "\"Things started off in a good way, I felt we had some progress,\" said the affable and conversational Sharp from his home in Florida. \"As the season went on, when certain objectives were out of reach and we'd been knocked out of the Champions League by Atletico, once that was gone and it became more and more difficult to reach the top four, the environment and the feeling was one of disappointment.",
      "\"There was a bit of a slide and perhaps that same appetite for what we were bringing to the table disappeared a bit. When you are competing for something you are on the edge and every player is so ready for it, and as soon as that goes... you see it at end of seasons when teams slide a bit.",
      "\"We hit a bit of that and the fact that we weren't full-time staff, it was hard for us to put something on the table because it had already been announced that Ten Hag was coming in.",
      "\"We couldn't say 'if you do this, you can be a part of this, and we are building this'. We are now managing it until the next guy comes in and that becomes a challenge.",
      "\"Was it viewed unfairly? The expectations at Man United are as high as they can be, and rightly so. We knew that going into it, anything short of a really good winning record, and trying to push for the Champions League and to have a good run in the Champions League, that was the objective. We were disappointed we didn't achieve that but there were a lot of challenges going on.\"",
      "Rangnick famously said United needed 'open heart surgery' in a quote that didn't sit well at the time but has perhaps become somewhat prophetic. United lifted two trophies under Ten Hag and reached the Europa League final last season, but the latest rebuild under Ruben Amorim is only just beginning.",
      "For Sharp, the chapter at Old Trafford was a privilege and a learning curve. The chance to work with elite players at an elite club, even if it was a difficult situation from the get-go amid poor form, a club at a crossroads and fan perception or Rangnick and an interim coaching team.",
      "\"Arriving at Man United was a big responsibility but I kept telling myself that Ralf had brought me here for a reason,\" reflects Sharp.",
      "\"I might not know everything about the game but I now what Ralf wants. I don't have all the solutions but I can help Ralf communicate his message. The players were receptive to it and open to it.",
      "\"I am not trying to help Bruno take a free kick but I can help him understand what the manager is asking of him or I can sit with him and say things I saw from the game and have a discussion, and perhaps help them see that for us and how Ralf wants us to play, this is why we want to see it this way. Most of the time players want to be better and to help the team so they will fit in with what the manager wants.",
      "\"It was a very difficult situation that we went into. I am so grateful for the opportunity but it was a challenging environment to be in. Partly because of where the club was at in that moment, but also in the way in which we came in. We came in on the back of Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, who you could feel was loved by the people inside the club. Everyone loved him, from the staff in the canteen to everyone.",
      "\"We came in and are coming in for an interim. When Ralf talked about that open heart surgery, one of his greatest strengths is creating a continuity and a vision for a club. Ralf knows how to put people in positions to build a whole club so that at least it works to a vision. And for Ralf to do that he has to be given the reins. He was recognising what a lot of the problems were and a lot of the things that could be improved to get it back to where it should be.\"",
      "United are not yet there, three years on from Sharp's departure. The hope is that under Amorim the Reds can embark on a successful journey back to the top. Sharp himself has been on quite the journey in football to reach the top.",
      "He left his native Scotland to go to America on a football scholarship at university and became interested in coaching. A friend introduced him to video analysis and Sharp dived into the analytical world and began doing analysis for the college he was attending to do his masters. An opportunity opened up in New York with the Red Bulls second team and it was there that Sharp met Rangnick.",
      "\"I have been lucky, lucky to meet the right people, for them to open doors for me,\" he adds, somewhat modestly. \"But then I know when I step through that door I can add value and contribute. Each step, you get hungry for the next environment.",
      "\"It (my journey) is a bit unconventional and a bit different but I am inspired by others. Fabian Hurzeler at Brighton is an example, he didn't have a big playing career and is a similar age to me and is performing really well in the Premier League with a great club.",
      "\"I am ambitious, hungry and believe I have some value to bring to the table and I have always trusted and back myself, so I have never been afraid to give my opinion which is important, but always in the right way.",
      "\"For me (being a head coach) is an aim, I am ambitious and hungry and every time I take a step up I am thinking about what is next.",
      "\"I love being in Europe and England and being close to my family. Having my mum and dad come to games at Old Trafford and see me down there was special for me. Those are memories I cherish.",
      "\"I would love to get back to England, but I don't feel in a rush to get there, but I want to keep developing and learning.\""

      "'By failing to prepare, you are preparing to fail'. Never has a quote been resembling a football club than this one with Manchester United and their transfer business.",
      "United are back to square one this summer after investing in Erik ten Hag this time last year. After the board decided parting ways with Ten Hag was the right decision, the Dutchman instead signed a new contract and was backed in the transfer market.",
      "Despite previous deals not working, the newly-formed recruitment team brought in two more players that had previously worked with Ten Hag with Matthijs de Ligt and Noussair Mazraoui. Leny Yoro and Joshua Zirkzee were signed and the priority position, a No.6, was not through the door until the third game of the season in the shape of Manuel Ugarte.",
      "Ten Hag was sacked and United went on to suffer their worst season in 51 years with a 15th-placed finish in the Premier League. Some would argue that United opting to keep Ten Hag when he should have gone was never going to work but the failure to get in the right players early in the market certainly played a huge role.",
      "12 months later and United are faced with a similar problem. Today (June 21) marks one month to the day that Ruben Amorim's men suffered defeat in the Europa League final to Tottenham, their rock bottom. It's also one month until the first pre-season game against Leeds United in Sweden.",
      "At the start of the month, it looked as though United were going to move with power and authority in the transfer window. Matheus Cunha's arrival from Wolves was the first of many hopeful signings this summer and Bryan Mbeumo rapidly became the next priority.",
      "However, going into the final week of June, United are in the exact same spot as they were after Cunha's was announced. Mbeumo isn't through the door, for whatever reason, and their hunt for a new prolific striker hasn't gathered pace. For United and the people at the club, that isn't a problem.",
      "\"We're going to do our best to do more signings quickly,\" Omar Berrada recently told The Athletic. \"Sometimes when you're not quick, it's because you're negotiating and you're trying to make sure you get the right value for money. So being efficient or quick isn't necessarily the best thing for the club.\"",
      "Getting Mbeumo and a new centre-forward before the start of pre-season is the dream scenario for Amorim. Following a difficult start to life at United, the Portuguese knows more than anyone that he needs to get his team well-drilled during pre-season before the start of the season.",
      "However, it isn't just incomings being delayed that is a problem. There are plenty of players who could be sold this summer but the four of Alejandro Garnacho, Jadon Sancho, Marcus Rashford and Antony are the big-hitters. Unfortunately, United are no closer to raising funds.",
      "Sancho is attracting interest from Italy while Antony is understood to be prepared to take a 30 per cent wage cut to leave the club on a permanent basis. United require a fee of £32.58m to avoid a loss on the Brazilian under the Premier League's profitability and sustainability regulation.",
      "A recent report from ESPN has suggested that Rashford is planning to return to United training next month if an exit has not been agreed. The same can be presumed about Sancho, Antony and Garnacho, meaning there's a real chance they could be included in the pre-season schedule. Players who appear to have no future in Amorim’s plans being part of the squad isn’t the best preparation.",
      "Player sales is something that United have struggled to master in recent years. Scott McTominay's switch to Napoli for £25.7m is the club's sixth most expensive departure. If you wanted an idea of how poor United are at cashing-in, Liverpool are about to sell Jarell Quansah - not a first-choice under Arne Slot - for around £34m.",
      "The Reds have a good relationship with Bayer Leverkusen after recently signing Florian Wirtz but the fact that they are about to get that fee for a defender who hasn't been superb speaks volumes of their ability to raise funds through player sales.",
      "It's something that United need to work on. Selling the four players is a must before pre-season and failure to do so will be a major contributing factor to Amorim's fate this season. By failing to prepare for their biggest season in years, United are preparing to fail."

      "After finishing with a negative goal difference for the second Premier League season running last term, Manchester United are rightly prioritising the additions of attackers this summer.",

      "United are now in hot pursuit of Brentford star Bryan Mbeumo. They tabled an opening offer for the Cameroonian earlier this month, understood to be worth £55m, but it was rejected.",
      "Talks between United and the Bees are understood to remain ongoing and the Reds are confident they will eventually secure Mbeumo's signature. The 25-year-old has informed confidants he wants to move to Old Trafford.",
      "In addition to signing Cunha and setting their sights on Mbeumo, United also want to sign a striker before the start of next season.",
      "They are continuing to be linked with a plethora of centre-forwards, such as Napoli's Victor Osimhen and Sporting Lisbon star Viktor Gyokeres, but they are yet to have settled on a preferred target after missing out on Liam Delap.",
      "On the ten occasions second-choice goalkeeper Altay Bayindir deputised for Onana in 2024/25, there were several instances where he failed to cover himself in glory, raising doubts about his suitability to be the latter's deputy. Onana, too, has been guilty of committing one too many errors throughout his United career.",
      "With United tying Tom Heaton down to a new one-year deal, there is a growing expectation Bayindir will leave this summer. It would make sense for him to leave in search of regular game time to boost his chances of becoming Turkey's No.1 ahead of next year's World Cup.",
      "Onana also is not safe from being pointed in the direction of the exit amid United's willingness to sell any member of the squad this summer, meaning it is entirely possible the club could recruit a new No.1 this summer, although the recruitment of a striker has to take priority.",
      "Over the last few weeks, Aston Villa goalkeeper Emiliano Martinez has been heavily linked with a move to Old Trafford. He has improved significantly since joining Villa from Arsenal in 2020, helping Villa get back into the Champions League and winning the World Cup and Copa America (twice) with Argentina.",
      "Turning 33 in September, Martinez is entering his prime years as a goalkeeper. Despite being somewhat erratic at times, just as he demonstrated when he floored Rasmus Hojlund on the final day of the Premier League season at Old Trafford last month, he has banked more credit than Onana has over the last few years.",
      "If United were to swoop for the Argentine, they would be doing so with a view to making him their first-choice goalkeeper, meaning they may have to sell Onana. The former Inter Milan shot-stopper will not be content with warming the bench.",
      "If United swoop for Martinez and bring him to Old Trafford this summer, he would become the first goalkeeper they have signed from a Premier League rival to become their No.1 since Edwin van der Sar in 2005.",
      "The legendary Dutchman joined United from Fulham 20 years ago at the age of 34 and remained United's No.1 up until his retirement at the end of the 2010/11 season.",
      "United have already demonstrated through the addition of Cunha and pursuit of Mbeumo they are prioritising signing proven Premier League players this summer, meaning it is not beyond the realms of possibility they may also look closer to home when attempting to sign a goalkeeper."

      "\"Without Champions League, we don’t need a big squad, we can control the squad in a better way. Then we have a plan that is to bring some new players, of course.",
      "\"But our big plan is to improve the team that we have, is to improve our academy, because I think that is the future. It was the past, so can be the future.\"It's not going to change so much because we have the financial fair play rules. We are not allowed to do much in this summer, even with Champions League, so we are prepared for that.",
      "\"It’s important to stick together. We are going to struggle, it is not going to be everything right away but I have a feeling and I see the team improving and that is the most important thing.”",
      "Despite that concern, United have been active in the transfer window. The club have completed the £62.5 million transfer of Matheus Cunha.",
      "“He’s a player that I think fans are going to love,” Berrada said on Cunha. “We can talk about his technical abilities and he can play in three different positions.",
      "“He’s a playmaking attacking midfielder; he can score goals, he can make assists. I think he’s going to lift people off their seats.",
      "“He’s got a bit of a swagger about him that people are going to really like. Dare I say, (Eric) Cantona-esque.",
      "“He was an important one to get done. We’re going to do our best to do more signings quickly. Sometimes when you’re not quick, it’s because you’re negotiating and you’re trying to make sure you get the right value for money. So being efficient or quick isn’t necessarily the best thing for the club.”",
      "United have also completed the signing of South American full-back Diego Leon for a fee of up to £7 million. The 17-year-old will join up with United next month, taking United’s total spend so far to £69.5 million.",
      "United are also working on a deal for Brentford forward Bryan Mbeumo. The club has seen one bid of £45million with a further £10million in add-ons turned down, but discussions are understood to be continuing.",
      "As reported by the MEN, United are also keen to strengthen their midfield, while any other significant incomings are expected to be driven by sales.",
      "Jadon Sancho, Antony, Marcus Rashford, Alejandro Garnacho and Casemiro are the five main players expected to leave this summer.",
      "United are looking for a fee of £40 million for Rashford, with Barcelona linked with an interest in the forward.",
      "Sancho spent the season on loan with Chelsea, but the Blues opted against making the deal permanent. They instead paid a £5 million fee to United to send the winger back.",
      "Real Betis are keen to make Antony’s loan move permanent, with the Brazilian impressing during a loan spell there over the second half of the season.",
      "Victor Lindelof, Jonny Evans and Christian Eriksen will all leave at the end of their contracts this month."

Partly because there are a handful of players who have already been told they have no future at the club, and partly because United need to raise funds to sanction the deals needed to improve their squad.",

      "United require a fee of £14.58m to avoid a loss on Sancho under the Premier League's profitability and sustainability regulations (PSR), and while he didn't exactly put himself in the shop window with three league goals in the 2024/25 season, United should be able to find someone willing to pay a £14.58m fee for a player who is showing an eagerness to move on.",
      "Antony's situation as a little more complicated by the need for United to recoup £32.58m to avoid a loss under PSR. That being said, his impressive loan spell at Real Betis in the second half of the season has seen him create a market for himself.",
      "There are still plenty of conversations needed before either player says goodbye to United, but both are eager to do what they can to move on. and that's a step in the direction."

      "Buying Premier League proven players hasn't been a priority for Manchester United in recent years.",
      "United have tended to target foreign leagues in a bid to strengthen their squad, but there has been a notable shift during Ruben Amorim's first summer transfer window at the helm.",
      "Matheus Cunha has already arrived from Wolves in a £62.5million deal, while there's hope Brentford star Bryan Mbeumo will soon join him at Old Trafford. Liam Delap was the club's primary striker target after he hit 12 in his maiden Premier League campaign, though the Manchester City academy graduate opted for a move to Chelsea instead.",
      "Whether some of the signings United have made in recent years from foreign leagues have struggled to adapt to the pressures that come with being a United player or the Premier League in general is up for debate. But there's no doubting the fact that targeting players who have shown themselves to be capable operators in the English top flight reduces the risk of more wasted money.",
      "Having inexplicably made just one attacking signing last summer following a season where they finished with a minus goal difference, United are aiming to bolster their attacking options. In Signing Cunha and targeting Mbeumo, they could soon add two of last season's top Premier League marksmen to their squad.",
      "Mbeumo finished the campaign with an impressive 20 league goals, while Cunha bagged 15 for a struggling Wolves side. The pair finished in the top 10 Premier League goalscorers last season, with Mbeumo the fourth-highest goalscorer and Cunha tied on eighth with Chelsea's Cole Palmer.",
      "Should they get a deal for Mbeumo over the line, it would mark a real statement of intent from United.",
      "In fact, only one English club has ever added two new players to their squad in a summer after said players finished in the top 10 Premier League goalscorers.",
      "The only club to have done so was Tottenham back in the summer of 2001, when they brought Gustavo Poyet and Teddy Sheringham to White Hart Lane. The latter struck 15 goals for United in the 2000/01 season to finish as the league's sixth top goalscorer, with Poyet firing 11 for Chelsea before a £2.2m move across the capital.",
      "Spurs almost repeated the feat in 2012 when signing Clint Dempsey and Emmanuel Adebayor, but the latter finished in the top 10 scorers the previous season while on loan at Spurs, he simply made his move permanent in the summer.",
      "Poyet and Sheringham both hit double figures in the 2001/02 Premier League season having arrived at Spurs in the summer. If United sign Mbeumo and the former Brentford man and Cunha hit double figures in the league next season, United will be on their way to fixing their biggest problem."

      "Manchester United are no longer the clinical, threatening attacking team that once took the Premier League by storm. It's not a stretch to say that the forward line that ended the 2024/25 season won't be first-choice under Ruben Amorim this season.",
      "Matheus Cunha has already signed to bolster United's attack, but the Brazilian isn't enough. A new centre-forward is as much of a priority as ever after Rasmus Hojlund's poor campaign, but nearly every club in Europe is fighting for a prolific goalscorer.",
      "United are putting all their eggs into Bryan Mbeumo, and after receiving the green light from the Cameroon international, the move has stalled. Tottenham's registered interest with Thomas Frank orchestrating their transfer business means the deal hasn't moved in the last week.",
      "There is still optimism that Mbeumo will leave Brentford and move to Old Trafford. Alongside Cunha, United are expected to head into the new campaign with an impressive attacking arsenal that includes Amad, Bruno Fernandes and Mason Mount when fit.",
      "However, United have been here before. Signing players with impressive records - Mbeumo scored 20 Premier League goals last term - for big fees and 12-15 months later, realising they either overpaid or the deal wasn't a smart piece of business. With the Brentford star, the early indications are that won't be the case, but the club can do their best to ensure that.",
      "First of all, secure the services of a goal-scoring striker that gives defenders nightmares. Viktor Gyokeres and Victor Osimhen both score goals for fun, and their ball-playing skills would be perfect for Mbeumo to run off and create opportunities himself.",
      "The quality around Mbeumo has to be better than what United fans were used to watching last season. Different wildcard options offer Amorim the ability to be flexible, such as playing Amad as an attacking wing-back - a role he excelled in last term.",
      "There's also little faith in Mount being Mr.Reliable this season after 46 games in two seasons. So what are the other options? In a world where transfer deals often spark a domino effect elsewhere, Mohammed Kudus could be the answer.",
      "Kudus is attracting interest from Premier League clubs including United and Chelsea. The playmaker, better as a No.10, is said to be open to leaving the London Stadium this summer and has an £85m release clause in his contract, which is valid to Premier League clubs for the first 10 days of next month.",
      "Now United certainly aren't desperate for another attacking playmaker. But adding another option in that position gives Mbeumo three (Cunha, Kudus and Fernandes) perfect partners in his position.",
      "In spite of all that, this is where Chelsea come in. Enzo Maresca's men are in the market for a new winger after deciding against buying Sancho, and Garnacho has been strongly linked with moving to Stamford Bridge.",
      "Negotiating a deal with the Blues which sees Garnacho move to Stamford Bridge would leave the door wide open for Kudus to move to United. A strong striker with the likes of Cunha, Mbeumo, Fernandes and Kudus all competing for a spot in the two No.10 positions is enough to take United from 15th to potential Champions League candidates."

      "Despite starting the season relatively slowly and not showing his best levels until after Christmas, he still managed to end the season with an impressive 19 goals to his name. He also chalked up 18 assists to finish the campaign with 37 direct goal contributions in 57 games.",
      "For a side that finished 15th in the Premier League and failed to win a trophy, it was an impressive haul. And it is why the United captain has been shortlisted for the Professional Footballers' Association [PFA] Players' Player of the Year award.",

      "Fernandes is the only player on the shortlist who will not be playing in the Champions League next season. In fact, if he stays at Old Trafford this summer, he will not be playing in Europe at all in 2025/26.",
      "When United needed someone to step forward and take responsibility in dark and testing times last season, Fernandes often obliged, taking it upon himself to get his teammates out of trouble.",
      "His form between late-February and mid-April was particularly impressive. His goals and assists in the league alone earned United eight points within that period.",
      "Back in March, United chief executive Omar Berrada opened up on United's recruitment plans for the summer and said no player will be sold this summer for financial purposes. Amid talk of Al-Hilal being prepared to pay £100million for Fernandes last month, that may have tested United's resolve amid his importance.",
      "His place on the PFA shortlist is deserved. On an individual basis, Fernandes had a great campaign in 2024/25, particularly in the second half of the season.",
      "However, that did not stop former United captain Roy Keane from criticising the Portuguese, suggesting talent is not always enough to succeed at Old Trafford.",

      "\"You have to have a starting point. I go back to it all - talent is not enough. Bruno's a talented player, but talent's not enough.\"",
      "Former Arsenal and England striker Ian Wright was sat alongside Keane at the time and he did his very best to defend Fernandes, which only led to Keane becoming more angry.",
      "He added: \"You talk to me [about] who you were in a dressing room with. 'Tony Adams was this, Tony Adams was that'. Yes, because he was a fighter. Bruno's not a fighter.",
      "\"You've got young players. You have to look at somebody and go 'I like what he does'.",
      "\"They all can't put the ball in the top of the net from 25 yards, I get that. But you want someone who is going 'lads, are you with me?\"'",
      "Young players can look up to Fernandes and feel inspired. He regularly takes it upon himself to get United out of trouble and he has been their best signing since Sir Alex Ferguson's retirement in 2013 by some distance.",
      "Keane has always wanted every United player to set exemplary standards, and that is fine. He has been there, done it and got the t-shirt.",

      "Two defenders out, two in at Liverpool? And which of Manchester United or Tottenham is leading the Bryan Mbeumo chase?",
      "With so much transfer talk doing the rounds, we’re here through the summer to sift through the bullsh*t and highlight the whispers that might have some substance.",
      "Each day we’re ranking the top 20 rumours involving Premier League clubs, the higher the link, the more likely we feel they are to become done deals.",
      "So we start with the tittle-tattle…",
      "",
      "20) 🔽 Alexander Isak – Newcastle to Liverpool\nWe know Liverpool like Isak. Everyone likes Isak. But the Reds seem to be lurking with intent to break the British transfer record, which will be necessary to tempt Newcastle. The Magpies want to keep the Swede, but they can sell a sale to their fans if they are getting silly money. And if Isak states a desire to move. Both things will need to happen. And they might…",
      "",
      "19) 🔼 Emiliano Martinez – Aston Villa to Manchester United\nWith Andre Onana needing punted and United focusing on other positions, this one feels unlikely. It’s a weird one; we don’t think it’s a load of rubbish, but it’s simply unrealistic right now.",
      "",
      "18) 🆕 Dusan Vlahovic – Juventus to Manchester United\nThe Serbia striker, linked with Arsenal since the womb, has apparently approached United directly because he fancies a move to Old Trafford. United, for their part, are quite receptive, especially having learned Vlahovic would cost just shy of £40million, which is less than Gyokeres. Keep an eye on this one.",
      "",
      "17) 🆕 Jadon Sancho – Manchester United to Juventus\nA move abroad is surely the plan for Sancho, but with so many United players, his salary will make any permanent departure tricky. Still, the source (Sky) is not a bad one…",
      "",
      "16) Marcus Rashford – Manchester United to Newcastle\nThe story goes that Newcastle are ‘confident of providing Rashford with an ideal stage to rebuild his career’. But they don’t want to pay for him – yet. Of course United want a permanent sale but the chances are the best they might get is a loan with an obligation.",
      "MORE ON THE SUMMER 2025 TRANSFER WINDOW\n👉 Every Premier League transfer and release confirmed in the summer of 2025\n👉 Twenty biggest transfers in the world in 2025 summer transfer window",
      "",
      "15) 🆕 Rodrigo Muniz – Fulham to Leeds\nLeeds have gone hard for Muniz – but not hard enough. Fulham rejected a £32million proposal, with £26million guaranteed, and the Cottagers want it to be known that they won’t sell the forward unless they get an offer they can’t refuse. One Leeds would be daft to make.",
      "",
      "14) Joao Pedro – Brighton to Newcastle\nThe Seagulls forward is intent on leaving Brighton to take the next step but apparently, wherever he goes, he wants to be the first choice. Which won’t happen at Newcastle for as long as Isak is around. So what does it say about Isak’s future that Newcastle are about to enter talks to bring Pedro from the south coast to the North East? If that is the Magpies’ intention, they will have to get around Brighton’s £60million valuation, which won’t be easy if the Seagulls see Newcastle bank a massive fee for Isak.",
      "",
      "13) Benjamin Sesko – RB Leipzig to Arsenal\nThere was talk of Arsenal submitting a serious bid this week, but they are reluctant to meet Leipzig’s valuation, which falls somewhere between £68milion and £85million. Which was always going to be around the going rate for a top centre-forward this summer. Where there was more noise around Arsenal choosing Sesko, the momentum is building again around the other guy.",
      "",
      "12) 🆕 Illia Zabarnyi – Bournemouth to PSG\nThe clubs are at least £15m apart on valuation according to latest reports, with Bournemouth understandably reluctant to see Zabarnyi follow Dean Huijsen out of the club in the same summer. The reality is, though, that there may ultimately be little they can do about it. Even if it means losing 80% of their back five from 2024/25.",
      "",
      "11) Andy Robertson – Liverpool to Atletico Madrid\nAtletico Madrid made a cheeky request to secure their ‘dream’ signing, but their participation in Gianni Infantino’s wet dream may hold things up. We can see A-Rob being right up Diego Simeone’s street.",
      "",
      "10) Son Heung-min – Tottenham to Saudi Arabia\nIt was widely reported that Spurs are ready to sell their skipper, but only after they have milked for every last penny by parading him on pre-season tour in his homeland. Levy, that. Apparently, Al-Ahli, Al-Nassr and Al-Qadsiah are all prepared to pay £34million for Son, who is entering the final year of his contract at Spurs.",
      "",
      "9) 🔼 Marc Guehi – Crystal Palace to Liverpool\nWith a year left on his contract and a renewal unlikely, Palace are willing to cash in on their captain, who could be the subject of a ‘significant offer’ from the champions when they receive the Jarell Quansah money. The contract situation is important; it means Liverpool will be reluctant to spend over the odds, and while Palace won’t have their pants pulled down, they cannot risk the prospect of their skipper leaving for free.",
      "",
      "8) 🔼 Ousmane Diomande – Sporting Lisbon to Crystal Palace\nThis could be a major coup for Palace, who are in for a player strongly linked with Arsenal, Manchester United and Spurs in the past. The Ivorian is only 21 years young and played 31 times as Sporting won the Portuguese top flight last season. He’d be a brilliant Guehi replacement.",
      "",
      "7) 🔽 Bryan Mbeumo – Brentford to Manchester United\nMbeumo only had eyes for United before Frank’s appointment at Spurs. United remained confident of getting their man, and some reports suggest they have submitted a second offer. But Brentford have got what they want – a bidding war. Beyond that, we’re all guessing, but of the two interested parties, United are probably the most concerned right now.",
      "",
      "6) Viktor Gyokeres – Sporting Lisbon to Arsenal\nArsenal are still keeping both Gyokeres and Sesko dangling, with both keen to move to the Emirates, but they are having more trouble charming their clubs. Sporting’s stance has irked Gyokeres to the point he’s not willing to meet to clear the air and the Swede could go on strike to force a move when he returns from St Tropez. Juventus have been turned down in favour of Arsenal, who may reasonably feel they can land Gyokeres for slightly less than they may have to pay for Sesko.",
      "",
      "5) 🔼 Bryan Mbeumo – Brentford to Tottenham\nAll Spurs had to do to pique Mbeumo’s intrigue was sack the manager and appoint the Cameroonian’s old one. Thomas Frank’s appointment has opened Mbeumo’s mind to the possibility of joining Tottenham, and while he did seem pretty determined to join the Man Utd circus, there is momentum gathering again around Spurs’ interest, which would allow the forward to remain in London, playing for a manager he appreciates.",
      "",
      "4) Martin Zubimendi – Real Sociedad to Arsenal\nThis one got the ‘Here we go’ treatment well over a month ago but then it all went a bit quiet. There was talk of Real Madrid sticking their nose in. Fear not, though, Gooners. Everyone reckons it’s done. So why the wait? Zubimendi is in the middle of three-week FIFA-mandated holiday, while reports suggest both clubs would prefer for the deal to go through the books in July.",
      "",
      "3) Sverre Nypan – Rosenborg to Manchester City\nArsenal fancied their chances of landing the Norwegian wonderkid, and Villa were in talks in recent months. But City are in the mood for signings and it looks like they have agreed a £12.5million deal for the 18-year-old attacking midfielder. A medical was scheduled for last week but we’ve heard nothing since, while City are in the United States for a nonsense tournament.",
      "",
      "2) Milos Kerkez – Bournemouth to Liverpool\nThis seemed to be done, but now we are told that Liverpool and Bournemouth ‘remain in talks’. Given the Cherries have signed a replacement, we presume it’s the very fine details being discussed and Kerkez will be heading to Anfield imminently.",
      "",
      "1) 🔼 Jarell Quansah – Liverpool to Bayer Leverkusen\nAfter rumours died down, they have ramped right back up again. And just like that, Quansah has reportedly agreed personal terms with Erik ten Hag’s side and is expected to join for at least £30m."

      "Manchester United junior graduate Pogba was initially banned from football for four years after failing a drugs test in August 2023 but his suspension was subsequently reduced to 18 months and he is now eligible to play again.",
      "Now 32, Pogba left Juventus by mutual consent last November as a result of his ban and is therefore a free agent. While there are clearly enormous risks involved in signing a player in his thirties who hasn’t played for so long, it’s no surprise that there are interested parties.",
      "Pogba left United for the second time to join the Bianconeri (for the second time) in 2022 but his second stint in Turin wasn’t anything like the success of the first.",
      "The French international was right at the heart of the Juventus team that won four Serie A titles on the bounce between 2013 and 2016 before he returned to Old Trafford to add the Europa League to his medal collection in 2016-17.",
      "Widely recognised as one of football’s most exceptional individual talents of the last ten years, Pogba hit his peak at the perfect moment, leading France to a World Cup win in Russia in 2018. It’s fair to say it’s all been downhill from there for the Parisian.",
      "With his ban now expired Pogba is searching for a route back into the game for what he hopes will be a positive conclusion to a career that delivered so much but should really have been so much more.",
      "Foot Mercato reported earlier in June that Pogba had been offered a deal by Monaco, whose management were ‘quickly seduced by this opportunity’ to bring in a World Cup winner as he works to ‘relaunch’ his career once more with an extremely ambitious target of rejoining Les Bleus at the World Cup in 2026.",
      "But there could be a Saudi Pro League spanner in the works for Monaco.",
      "Jeddah side Al Ittihad, one of the handful of Saudi Pro League clubs majority owned by the state Public Investment Fund and the reigning Saudi champions, has reportedly ‘begun initial discussions’ with Pogba.",
      "Should Pogba opt for Saudi Arabia over Monaco, he would become the fourth French player in a squad managed by 1998 World Cup winner Laurent Blanc.",
      "Al Ittihad are captained by Pogba’s one-time France teammate Karim Benzema and former Premier League players N’Golo Kante and Moussa Diaby also play for the Tigers, who finished 2024-25 in a very comfortable first place.",
      "Blanc also has former Liverpool midfielder Fabinho and ex-Tottenham Hotspur man Steven Bergwijn at his disposal but Pogba is far from a certain addition.",
      "“Optimism remains high within Monaco, even though the former Manchester United star is exploring all opportunities,” reports Foot Mercato.",
      "A little more expensive than that set of golf clubs in the garage…these players all left their Premier League clubs at a massive loss.",
      "Florian Wirtz is set to become the Premier League’s most expensive signing but how have his predecessors fared?",
      "Paul Pogba could be set for a return to football with AS Monaco offering the ex-Manchester United midfielder a two-year contract.",
      "Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo picking this abysmal version of Manchester United over Champions League teams has boggled minds but there is plenty of precedent.",
      "Paul Pogba has reportedly ‘held talks’ with a Champions League club after opening up on the “hell” of a doping ban which kept him out of football for 18 months.",
      "Man Utd should make move to re-sign former Red Devils midfielder Paul Pogba as they can’t “afford not to consider a move”, according to Dwight Yorke."

      "",
      "8) Borussia Dortmund – £52.48m\nThey used the Club World Cup transfer window to bring in Jobe Bellingham and Yan Couto and they could add Jason Sancho.",
      "",
      "7) Tottenham – £60.52m\nThat’s a decent whack of money spent on Kevin Danso, Mathys Tel and Luka Vuskovic before Thomas Frank even gets a say.",

      "",

      "",
      "4) Real Madrid – £97.6m\nThey had already dropped £50m on Dean Huijsen and £8.5m on a few weeks of Trent Alexander-Arnold before they agreed to sign man-child Franco Mastantuono for an awful lot of money.",
      "",
      "3) Chelsea – £102.6m\nThey were the top spenders in the summers of 2024, 2023 and 2022 and will be up there in 2025 thanks to pre-arranged moves for Estevao, Dario Essugo, Mamadou Sarr and Kendry Paez. Throw in the £30m signing of Liam Delap and the Blues are already making very expensive waves.",
      "",
      "2) Manchester City – £109.6m\nThat’s the price of a Rayan Ait-Nouri from Wolves, a Rayan Cherki from Lyon and a Tijanji Reijnders from AC Milan, and all of them feel like bargains. Pep Guardiola wanted Florian Wirtz but he cost more on his own.",
      "",
      "1) Liverpool – £131m\nThe Wirtz deal alone would be enough to propel Liverpool to top spot at this time, without having to even remember the Jeremie Frimpong deal. Unlikely they’ve concluded their spending, either."

      "Florian Wirtz has become the most expensive attacking midfielder in history by an absurd margin – here’s a rundown of the top 20.",
      "",
      "1) Florian Wirtz – £100m/€116m (Bayer Leverkusen to Liverpool, June 2025)\nAs statements of intent from defending champions go, it’s a chunky one as Liverpool add the most expensive AM in history to a squad that cruised to Premier League glory last season.",
      "",
      "2) James Rodriguez – £63.2m/€80m (Monaco to Real Madrid, July 2014)\nNever before has a shop window been so successfully deployed as when Rodriguez and his giant pet grasshopper dominated the 2014 World Cup so thoroughly that Real Madrid couldn’t help but make the Colombian the fourth most expensive footballer ever at the time. His next permanent club being Everton remains hilarious.",
      "",
      "3) Thomas Lemar – £63m/€70m (Monaco to Atletico Madrid, June 2018)\nWith failed club-record bids from Arsenal and Liverpool in his back pocket, Lemar took his eternal search for justice to Spain and Diego Simeone has not let him go since.",
      "",
      "4) Dominik Szoboszlai – £60m/€69.8m (Leipzig to Liverpool, July 2023)\nNeeding to remodel their entire midfield, Liverpool first signed Alexis Mac Allister at an apparent knockdown price before mulling over the release clause of Szoboszlai and pulling ahead of Newcastle to trigger it before expiration.",
      "",
      "5) Kaka – £56m/€65m (AC Milan to Real Madrid, June 2009)\nThe world’s costliest signing of all time – at least for a couple of weeks. After a planned £91m move to Manchester City on £500,000-a-week wages collapsed the previous January, Kaka went for a slightly more modest fee and delivered even less flashy numbers: 29 goals, 39 assists, 120 appearances and two trophies in four years before heading back to the Rossoneri on a free.",
      "",
      "6) Bruno Fernandes – £55.6m/€65m (Sporting to Man Utd, January 2020)\nAdd-ons have already far surpassed the initial £46.6m fee, with Sporting potentially due another £12.7m if Fernandes wins the PFA Player of the Year award or makes the Ballon d’Or top three. Manchester United could have doubled their money but knew they couldn’t afford the risk.",
      "",
      "7) Mason Mount – £55m/€64.2m (Chelsea to Man Utd, July 2023)\nA year from free agency and yet Manchester United’s desperation led them to pay a fair whack for the England international and Champions League winner. He has shown little since.",
      "",
      "8) Oscar – £52m/€60m (Chelsea to Shanghai SIPG, January 2017)\n“Every football player, or every person who works, wants to earn money to help their families. I came from a social background in Brazil that is very poor. We didn’t have anything. This is the fruit of my work and when I earn this, it is because I conquered it. The same way I came here, I will be able to return to Europe.” Fair play, although that continental comeback will probably never materialise now he’s back in Brazil.",
      "",
      "9) Dani Olmo – £51m/€60m (Leipzig to Barcelona, August 2024)\nThere have been registration issues owing to his new club’s continued financial difficulties but when Olmo has been able to play he has contributed healthily, with 12 goals and seven assists in a disrupted debut season.",
      "",
      "10) Otavio – £50.5m/€60m (Porto to Al-Nassr, August 2023)\nA star of the Saudi Arabia summer transfer window that was, Otavio has fared well enough but rumours persist over a return to Europe.",
      "",
      "11) Zinedine Zidane – £46.6m/€76m (Juventus to Real Madrid, July 2001)\nWith Spurs presumably unwilling to let Tim Sherwood go, Real Madrid had to settle for second best and a man absolutely dripping in Galactico rizz.",
      "",
      "12) Teun Koopmeiners – £46.1m/€54.7m (Atalanta to Juventus, August 2024)\nShortly after being crowned a Europa League winner, Koopmeiners made the move one place up the Serie A table to accompany The Old Lady on their continued hopeful journey towards relevance.",
      "",
      "13) Gylfi Sigurdsson – £45m/€53m (Swansea to Everton, August 2017)\nPart of the single greatest season of Premier League club-specific signings, with Everton also bringing in Davy Klaassen (£23.6m), Henry Onyekuru (£6.8m), Sandro Ramirez (£5.2m), Jordan Pickford (£30m), Michael Keane (£25m), Wayne Rooney (free), Nikola Vlasic (£8m), Cenk Tosun (£27.5m) and Theo Walcott (£20m).",
      "",
      "14) Bernardo Silva – £43m/€50m (Monaco to Manchester City, May 2017)\nThe Portuguese has tried to leave almost every summer since but 14 trophies and more appearances under Pep Guardiola than any other player ever has been a fair consolation prize.",
      "",
      "15) Cole Palmer – £42.5m/€50.4m (Manchester City to Chelsea, September 2023)\nIt seemed like a ridiculous move at the time but was until recently the one unqualified transfer success of this Chelsea regime. Forty goals, 27 assist, 91 appearances and an eternal contract is fine business.",
      "",
      "16) Mesut Ozil – £42.4m/€50m (Real Madrid to Arsenal, September 2013)\nPoor Geraint Hughes must still be having flashbacks after being encompassed by giddy Arsenal fans celebrating the quite unfathomable capture of a Real Madrid star at his peak. Everyone knows how that five-year contract and three-year extension in 2018 played out eventually but there were moments of absolute brilliance first.",
      "",
      "17) Xavi Simons – £42.1m/€50m (Paris Saint-Germain to Leipzig, January 2025)\nAfter a pair of successful loans it was decided that selling club Leipzig would indulge in a spot of record-breaking buying, making Simons the most expensive player in their history by a mile.",
      "",
      "18) James Maddison – £40m/€46.3m (Leicester to Tottenham, June 2023)\nAt one stage the most expensive Premier League signing from a relegated club, Maddison would be fortunate to emulate a former holder of that title in Moussa Sissoko.",
      "",
      "19) Joelinton – £40m/€45m (Hoffenheim to Newcastle, July 2019)\nDoes he belong on the list of most expensive midfielders, forwards or strikers instead? Genuinely not sure. But Eddie Howe has treasured and transformed Steve Bruce’s trash in so very many ways.",
      "",
      "20) James Rodriguez – £38.5m/€45m (Porto to Monaco, May 2013)\nLong before a Galactico future could be considered, Rodriguez was moving to newly-minted Monaco as the more expensive part of a double transfer with Joao Moutinho. The Colombian scored nine goals and assisted 13 in his only Ligue Un season."

      "Three of those players subsequently had their contracts terminated early, while Lacazette was at least allowed to see out his Arsenal deal before leaving on a free transfer when it expired. Presumably that’s why they have not signed a decent striker since.",
      "",
      "Wesley Moraes – £22m (Club Brugge, June 2019)\nOllie Watkins – £28m, rising to £33m (Brentford, September 2020)\nEmi Buendia – £30m, rising to £38m (Norwich, June 2021)\nMoussa Diaby – £43.2m, rising to £51.9m (Bayer Leverkusen, July 2023)\nAmadou Onana – £50m (Everton, July 2024)",
      "Add-ons make things a little murky – Watkins has surely achieved his while Buendia has not – but the total value of the package to bring in Diaby was in a different market to where Villa usually deal. They then somehow sold the Frenchman for a profit, which allowed them to break their transfer record for the Everton and Belgium midfielder.",

      "Six years is a big old gap between record buys, but selling Dominic Solanke to Tottenham for a small fortune enabled them to reinvest in Evanilson, who pushed Tyrone Mings off this list.",

      "The previous two record signings bumped off this Brentford list by more recent deals were Bryan Mbeumo and Ivan Toney; the hope is that Igor Thiago can have anything close to their success. A series of horrendous injuries limiting him to eight Premier League games (no goals) was a sub-optimal start.",

      "Brilliant as Brighton are, their transfer strength has been in identifying rough diamonds from faraway lands to polish and move on for considerable profit rather than spending big. Pedro might be the exception as Brighton could pretty much double their money on the Brazilian, but Rutter’s first season was underwhelming.",
      "",
      "Jeff Hendrick – £10.5m (Derby, August 2016)\nRobbie Brady – £13m (Norwich, January 2017)\nChris Wood – £15m (Leeds, August 2017)\nBen Gibson – £15m (Middlesbrough, August 2018)\nZeki Amdouni – £16.1m (Basel, July 2023)",
      "The first two of those names left for nothing, so Burnley bucked the trend by at least securing a hefty profit for Wood. They will also make a few pennies on Amdouni after a decent loan spell with Benfica. Expect them to break that record again this summer as they attempt (likely in vain) to stay in the Premier League.",

      "There is a genuine case to say Fernandez is legitimately the best of those Chelsea signings, which reflects well on no-one. But Todd Boehly has continued that proud tradition of general waste, with £100m Moises Caicedo finally approaching his best form as the other half of a potentially sensational midfield.",

      "A ludicrous fact: not a single one of those signings was made by Roy Hodgson (nine transfer windows in charge). Crystal Palace presumably still regret giving Alan Pardew (four transfer windows in charge) quite so much pocket money.",

      "Fulham do like to use their regular Premier League promotions, or in the case of Mitroglou imminent relegations, to open new transfer doors. Though last summer they waited for the cash to arrive for Joao Palhinha before splashing out on Smith Rowe. The jury is out on whether he was worth the outlay.",

      "It took 20 months for Leeds to break their transfer record thrice from July 1999. It took 20 years for Leeds to break their transfer record once from November 2000. They took a chance on Rutter in 2023 that did not save them from relegation but did at least make a small profit when he became Brighton’s record signing.",

      "The blockbuster arrival of Florian Wirtz blows the Van Dijk fee out of the water, but the good news for Liverpool is that this is a list containing more unambiguous success stories than most, and you always need an exception to prove the rule anyway. If you want further proof of Liverpool’s ability to get a record transfer just right, the player knocked out of this top five by Wirtz? Fernando Torres.",

      "Manchester United have reportedly made ‘initial contact’ with a goalkeeper who kept 18 clean sheets last season as an approach for current goalkeeper Andre Onana has been made by a European big hitter.",
      "United have seemingly given up on Onana after two seasons. In both his campaigns at Old Trafford, the former Inter Milan goalkeeper has made mistakes.",
      "In last season’s Premier League, he was at fault for three goals, and more in the Europa League.",
      "As a result, United are looking to go in a different direction, while also getting rid of Onana. According to Gianluca di Marzio, Monaco have ‘made an enquiry’ for the United keeper.",
      "It is not clear how much the Ligue 1 side would be willing to bid for Onana. However, Di Marzio states the goalkeeper who United ‘like the most’ is Atalanta’s Marco Carnesecchi.",
      "It is stated ‘initial contacts’ have been made with the goalkeeper’s agent, but not with his club, Atalanta, who it’s believed would not let Carnesecchi go without a satisfactory offer being made.",
      "The Italian kept 18 clean sheets last season – 13 in Serie A and five in the Champions League. Only three men kept clean sheets more often than he did in the Italian top flight last season.",
      "As such, it seems Carnesecchi would be a good option, and is a solid alternative to Emi Martinez, who United might struggle to sign.",
      "It’s been suggested they are willing to pay £40million for him, and that they’ve been given good signs the Argentina goalkeeper wants to join, with multiple reports suggesting he’d look favourably on a move to Old Trafford.",
      "But it has recently been reported that Atletico Madrid have the best chance of landing Martinez.",
      "Indeed, United and Atletico are said to be the two sides most likely to sign the keeper, but United are ‘ringing every day’ to try to convince him as it’s suggested his ‘preference’ is to go to Atletico as he wants to play under Diego Simeone.",
      "Atleti have Champions League football on offer, and United have no European football at all.",
      "That could similarly hurt them in pursuit of Carnesecchi, given he played in nine games of the elite European competition last season, and he’d play in it again next season if he were to remain with Atalanta.",
      "However, it’s unclear what the response has been from his agent to the approach from United.",
      "According to reports, Manchester United head coach Ruben Amorim has made a decision on his “favourite” option to replace one of his current starters.",
      "According to reports, Manchester United have ‘chosen’ their ‘preferred’ replacement for Andre Onana and all parties are open to the transfer.",
      "Man Utd have been handed a boost in their bid to sign a replacement for Andre Onana as a £40m star has ‘offered himself’ to the Red Devils in a ...",
      "A Manchester United player has reportedly played a role in stopping his club getting hijacked for a star forward, who they will bid again for soon.",
      "Ruben Amorim has now decided he ‘trusts’ the supposedly ‘sentenced’ Man Utd star to ‘redeem himself with a more solid structure’ rather than signing a replacement.",
      "According to reports, Manchester United have been forced to hatch a new ‘plan’ as they look to replace current No.1 Andre Onana."

      "Manchester United are reportedly ringing an elite goalkeeper ‘every day’ in the hopes that he’ll choose them over a move to Atletico Madrid.",
      "United are in the market for a new goalkeeper after Andre Onana had a poor season last time out. The Cameroon international was at fault for three goals the Red Devils conceded in the Premier League last season, and more in other competitions.",
      "He has been given more than enough chances over the past couple of season, and United now want to go in another direction.",
      "They have been heavily linked with Aston Villa’s Emi Martinez of late, and it’s been suggested that a move for the Argentina international is progressing.",
      "It has been suggested for a short while that Martinez wants to sign for United, having said yes if Onana is to leave, per a report, which also states there’s been ‘positive feedback’ over a move for the keeper, who wants to leave Villa.",
      "But that Martinez wants to head to United has been thrown up in the air.",
      "A report from Football Insider suggests the Red Devils are ‘ringing every day’ to get a deal over the line in the coming weeks, as it’s believed Villa don’t have long before they need to sell Martinez due to PSR pressures.",
      "But the twist is that it’s believed Martinez actually wants to go to Atletico Madrid. They and United are said to be the leading candidates, but the Spanish side is his ‘preference’ as he’d like to play under Diego Simeone.",
      "There is said to be a fear at the Metropolitano about losing Jan Oblak, given the goalkeeper – who has played 494 times for Atletico – is the subject of interest from the Saudi Pro League.",
      "Given a lot of reports have suggested that Martinez wants to go to United, there is seemingly confusion over where he actually wants to end up.",
      "Atletico have the pull of Champions League football, while United will not play any European football at all next season, so there is certainly good reason for Martinez to want to move to the Spanish side and not the Red Devils.",
      "If Villa are indeed planning to sell before June 30, when the books have to be finalised, then there will seemingly be an answer over where Martinez will end up at very soon.",
      "Aston Villa goalkeeper Emi Martinez is pushing for a transfer to Man Utd, knocking back some ‘big hitters’ in the process, according to reports.",

      "Arsenal, Liverpool and Manchester United are all expected to sign a new striker this summer. Here are the 10 best available.",
      "",
      "10) Darwin Nunez (Liverpool)\nYou may question whether Darwin Nunez even deserves a place in this top 10. Statistics are not in his favour, but we wanted to include him and know he is available this summer. The only players we feel harsh leaving out are Mateo Retegui, Loic Openda and Randal Kolo Muani. And then you’ve got more debatably ‘available’ players like Alexander Isak.",
      "The Liverpool striker is an enigma. He is Captain Chaos. We love him – but for all the wrong reasons. Who in their right mind will be brazen enough to take him on? Napoli, it would seem. He’ll almost certainly move abroad, and La Liga or Serie A feels right.",
      "Darwin is still just 25, but 40 goals in 142 Liverpool games leaves a lot to be desired. Whoever signs him is taking a risk, but the potential reward is big. If someone can polish the rough edges, there’s a talented boy in there. Somewhere. We think.",
      "MORE: Transfer rumour power ranking: Liverpool eye England star as Mbeumo race tightens…",
      "",
      "9) Cristiano Ronaldo (Al Nassr)\nThe big dog Cristiano Ronaldo is out of contract at Al Nassr this summer and after rumours of an exit, chances are he will sign a new deal.",
      "He’s won absolutely nothing of note out there, but that hasn’t stopped him scoring 93 goals in 105 games. Bobbins league or not, that’s very good.",
      "A return to the Premier League is, of course, pure fantasy. But a free transfer to Al Hilal to chase trophies in the Middle East feels entirely on brand. The most shameless move of the window might still belong to Cristiano.",
      "",
      "8) Ollie Watkins (Aston Villa)\nThere was an offer from Arsenal in January that was incredibly ill-timed as Aston Villa had just agreed to sell Jhon Duran, but both club and player would likely be interested if the Gunners returned again.",
      "The problem? Watkins is now 29, which puts him firmly in the undesirable camp in modern football. But he does guarantee Premier League goals, delivering double figures in each of his last five seasons. If he’s patient, he might be the beneficiary of a late panic.",
      "",
      "7) Dusan Vlahovic (Juventus)\nDusan Vlahovic turned down Arsenal for Juventus in 2022, and it’s hard to fault him; it looked like the right call at the time. But hindsight is cruel and Arsenal are going a lot better than the Old Lady.",
      "Things haven’t quite clicked for the Serbian in Turin. A goal every three games is fine, but not what you expect from a £70million signing. Juventus are reportedly open to selling, though swap deals seem to be their go-to route.",
      "It’s tough to pin down his next move. He’s good enough to start for a big club, but not quite good enough to justify a bidding war. Vlahovic’s future might be the most unpredictable on this list.",
      "",
      "6) Victor Boniface (Bayer Leverkusen)\nWith Xabi Alonso gone, Leverkusen are braced for a summer exodus. Victor Boniface could be part of that.",
      "Boniface was reportedly close to joining Al Nassr in January but they went for Jhon Duran instead, so there is clearly an openness on Leverkusen’s side to sell, while the player is happy to take on a new challenge.",
      "The Nigerian’s stock was at its peak during Leverkusen’s unbeaten Bundesliga run in 2023/24, but he’s still a hugely viable option for big European sides. He shouldn’t be vanishing into the Saudi wilderness just yet, regardless of how many zeroes are on the cheque.",
      "",
      "5) Jonathan David (Lille)\nJonathan David is available on a free transfer after confirming he’ll leave Lille this summer, making him one of the biggest bargains out there – if he drops his reportedly ridiculous wage demands.",
      "He’s scored 109 goals in 232 games for Lille, including 10 in 18 Champions League appearances. Those numbers, plus the lack of a transfer fee, make him extremely appealing.",
      "Unfortunately, it’s mostly Saudi clubs who can meet his current terms – which include €15m in commissions. If he gets realistic, there’s a brilliant forward here for someone in need.",
      "",
      "4) Hugo Ekitike (Eintracht Frankfurt)\nNewcastle United tried to sign Hugo Ekitike from Stade Reims before he joined Paris Saint-Germain, only to flop disastrously in the French capital while the Magpies soared into the Champions League with Alexander Isak leading the line. It worked out okay for the latter but Ekitike’s time in Paris was miserable.",
      "Ekitike reportedly blocked PSG’s attempts to sign Randal Kolo Muani by refusing to go the other way – then eventually went to Frankfurt anyway, where he’s been a revelation and will make them a lot of money.",
      "After scoring 22 goals and providing 12 assists in 48 matches for Frankfurt this season, he is being strongly linked with Manchester United.",
      "Ekitike is a unique striker with a very high ceiling. Like Sesko, his height makes him a problem for any defender when it’s combined with such pace and power. Given he’s already been at PSG and flopped, a move to the Premier League feels likely. We’re not ruling out Juventus, though.",
      "",
      "3) Benjamin Sesko (RB Leipzig)\nTrying to predict Benjamin Sesko’s future is pointless. He could be world-class, or he could disappear into a Chelsea-shaped vortex and be playing for Wolves in 2027, with all due respect to Wolves.",
      "Still, the hype is real. And Mikel Arteta reportedly prefers him to Gyokeres. Sesko has the size, pace, and technical skill to become an elite striker – but he’s not there yet. If someone’s patient, he could end up being the best player on this entire list.",
      "",
      "2) Viktor Gyokeres (Sporting CP)\nReportedly Arsenal’s top striker target and adored by Mikel Arteta’s new sporting director Andrea Berta, Viktor Gyokeres has been red hot this year after finishing 2024 as Europe’s top scorer.",
      "Arsenal have been crying out for an out-and-out goalscorer ever since Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang left in 2022, and Gyokeres would be a smart signing. Perhaps the last piece of the puzzle that can help the Gunners win the Premier League or Champions League next season.",
      "He scored 39 goals in 33 league games last season and topped the charts in Europe across all competitions. The fact it’s in Portugal doesn’t dilute the achievement – he also got six in eight in the Champions League, including a hat-trick in a win against Manchester City that got Man United fans all giddy.",
      "Sometimes stats don’t lie and that’s the case with Gyokeres. He’s clearly just what Arteta needs. It’s now just about meeting Sporting’s price.",
      "",
      "1) Victor Osimhen (Napoli)\nIt’s bizarre how little noise there’s been around Victor Osimhen. In the last five years, there have not been many better strikers and he was the main man in Napoli’s first title-winning campaign 33 years in 2022/23. Despite his reputation, goal record and availability, there has been a real lack of interest.",
      "We are left scratching our head trying to work out why. Is it down to his attitude? It could well be. There have been some questionable things said by the player and his agent in recent years and with no big clubs seemingly interested, other big clubs are reluctant to bring him in. His wage demands could be a key factor. We all know that Napoli want to sell and at a price that is very reasonable for a player of Osimhen’s quality.",
      "A transfer to Chelsea last summer ticked all of the boxes but the Premier League club didn’t fancy it and went into the season with Nicolas Jackson as their only out-and-out striker and versatile forward Christopher Nkunku as back-up. Chelsea have now brought in Liam Delap, meaning Osimhen is unlikely to get a Premier League move that not so long ago felt inevitable.",
      "Saudi Arabia now feels the most obvious next move for Osimhen, but he reportedly wants to stay in Europe. Liverpool have been linked with a swap deal involving Darwin Nunez, which almost makes too much sense. We shall see.",
      "READ NOW: Predicting where the 12 players *definitely* leaving in the top 100 are going this summer",

      "Marcus Rashford and Manchester United will part this summer but one of his eight transfer options is even more unlikely than him staying at Old Trafford.",
      "The Manchester-born striker made his Premier League debut under Louis van Gaal in 2016 but the former fresh-faced wonderkid is surplus to requirements at Old Trafford.",
      "Having fallen out of favour with Ruben Amorim, he spent the second half of last season on loan at Aston Villa but is back in Manchester, now looking for his next move.",
      "Here’s where we reckon Rashford could end up:",
      "",
      "After some depressing final months at Old Trafford, Rashford seemed to be back enjoying football when he moved to Villa Park.",
      "He contributed to 10 goals in 17 games as he and fellow loanees Marco Asensio played a part in Villa’s run in and push for the Champions League but a return for Rashford seems unlikely for 325,000 reasons.",
      "Villa are one of the clubs thought to be under most pressure from PSR rules but it is actually UEFA’s financial laws that could cause the Birmingham club a headache.",
      "From the 2025-26 season, UEFA say only 70% of a club’s spending can be on ‘squad cost’ which is the sum of first-team and manager wages, transfer fees, agent and intermediary costs and fees paid to pay off former players/managers divided by day-to-day income, incoming transfer player and manager fees and any other transfer income.",
      "In their most recent published accounts, Villa’s overall wage bill was £252m and their revenue £257.7m. So adding Rashford with his £325,000 salary to that equation seems silly.",
      "Verdict: Incredibly unlikely",
      "",
      "If Rashford returning to Villa seems impossible, him staying at Manchester United looks just as unlikely.",
      "But with an expensive contract that runs until 2028, Rashford would be within his rights to stay at the club and take home his pay cheque.",
      "However, with a World Cup next year, Rashford will want to play so he can be part of Thomas Tuchel’s England side.",
      "Verdict: Very unlikely",
      "",
      "Having offered his services to them in January, Rashford moving to Barcelona looked a real possibility this summer but developments in the last few days seem to have put an end to it.",
      "Fabrizio Romano reported on Thursday that the Camp Nou club had agreed terms with Athletic Bilbao’s Nico Williams having long been interested in the Spain forward.",
      "The transfer, not to mention the money involved in, would see a player take up Rashford’s favoured spot, meaning his chance to move to Barcelona may have come and gone.",
      "Verdict: Unlikely",
      "If you glanced across any transfer rumour so far this summer, chances are Galatasaray have been mentioned.",
      "The Turkish side have been linked with almost every player going and reports of their interest in Rashford first emerged in November.",
      "A move to Villa cooled that link but with Rashford still on the market, Galatasaray could look to tempt him to Turkey to join a strike force which Leroy Sane will soon be a part of.",
      "Verdict: Possible",
      "",
      "Rashford need only ask Scott McTominay how a move to Italy can rejuvenate a career and Serie A has become somewhat of a rescue place for misfiring Premier League players.",
      "Of the Italian clubs, it is Inter who have been linked with the Sun suggesting the San Siro side were interested. But given it is the Sun that may well be incorrect.",
      "But wages may well be an issue. Inter’s current top earner is Lautaro Martinez on €320,000 a week, meaning Rashford’s £325,000 would make him easily the club’s best-paid player, potentially disrupting squad harmony and putting Inter under considerable financial strain.",
      "The Champions League final showed how Inter needed some younger blood to go with their experience and if they can get Rashford to drop his wages, they could make a move for him.",
      "Verdict: Possible (if Rashford drops wage demands)",
      "While the outrageous spending has curtailed somewhat, the Saudi Pro League remains a comfortable landing place for unwanted Premier League stars.",
      "To date, five English players have made the move to Saudi and Rashford may well join them if he cannot find a better move in Europe.",

      "The Professional Footballers’ Association have named the six players who received the most votes for the Players’ Player of the Year award with Mo Salah widely expected to win the trophy.",
      "The Liverpool forward blitzed just about every record going as part of an incredible season which saw Liverpool win their second Premier League title.",
      "The Egyptian scored 29 times, six more than any other player, and also topped the assist charts with 18. That form makes Salah the overwhelming favourite but he has been joined by five other players on the season’s shortlist ahead of the final ceremony.",

      "Cole Palmer also features despite having a poor second half of the season. The English midfielder scored 15 goals in the league last year but only three of those came in 2025. The 23-year-old was named PFA Fans’ Player of the Year and PFA Young Player of the Year in 2024.",
      "One man who did not have trouble finding the net is Alexander Isak who has also reached the top six. The Swede scored 23 goals in 34 league appearances as Newcastle qualified for the Champions League.",
      "Arsenal’s Declan Rice completes the top six having been crucial to the Gunners’ performances last season.",
      "Another notable absence is Phil Foden who picked up the award in 2024 but followed that up with a poor 2024-25 campaign. The Manchester City winger scored just seven goals in 28 Premier League appearances.",

So we get to see most of the best players in the world, decent, competitive football, but still with some jeopardy.",

It’s not the FA Cup, either, with it’s history.",

These same issues act as a significant deterrent for ‘foreigners’ attending these games – unless absolutely necessary.",

Much was made of the first game and opening ceremony, as well as articles implying that it is a very English attitude to be against this competition while the Latin world is loving it. Spanish is becoming the lingua franca of football, as if those same pundits had never been to Miami to realize it is a microcosm of the Latin American world. However, it is so different from the rest of the U.S.; for example, Chicago, Boston, and New York would have more Irish and Italian heritage.

We’re not saying he has to be signed and given the No.9 shirt. No, he’d take on a Jonny Evans-like role, mentoring the rather hopeless-looking Rasmus Hojlund into a proper fox in the box, turning Joshua Zirkzee into an actual No.9, and helping Matheus Cunha score even more goals.",
      "The only natural striker Ruben Amorim has right now is Hojlund, a £70million investment United surely aren’t ready to chuck in the bin for a shiny new toy. Having already missed out on Liam Delap, United need a cost-effective striker who can relieve some pressure on Hojlund’s still-young shoulders.",

      "Manchester United have submitted an improved bid for Brentford star Bryan Mbeumo but may miss out on the forward as there’s now a “good chance” he will “choose Spurs” ahead of the Red Devils.",
      "United have already secured the signing of Matheus Cunha after they triggered his £62.5m release clause to bring him in from Wolves and want Mbeumo to play in the other inverted No.10 position in Ruben Amorim’s now infamous 3-4-3 formation.",
      "They saw a bid of £45m plus £10m in add-ons rejected by Brentford for the 25-year-old earlier this month, but were confident of wrapping up the deal with Mbeumo keen on the move to Old Trafford.",
      "Thomas Frank’s move to Tottenham threw a spanner in the works as the Danish boss wants to bring Mbeumo with him from Brentford, but reports had suggested Spurs had backed away from a possible move as it supposedly became clear that the Cameroon international only had eyes for United.",

      "Although it’s not clear what the make-up of that deal is, no matter the up-front fee and add-ons, it looks set to be rejected by Brentford as the Bees hold out for a fee closer to £70m for the winger, who got 20 goals and eight assists in the Premier League last term.",
      "The Bees may also be boosted by Castles’ revelation that “there’s a good chance” that Mbeumo might “choose Spurs ahead of Manchester United”, offering the prospect of a bidding war between the two clubs.",
      "Castles cited two “obvious reasons” for Mbeumo’s U-turn on The Transfers Podcast.",
      "“The indication from Manchester United was Mbeumo had chosen to move there and verbally told them that his preference was to move there,” Castles said. “But I’m not hearing exactly the same on that.",
      "“I think there is a good chance that Mbeumo, should Tottenham get to the price that Brentford are asking, that he might choose Spurs ahead of Manchester United.",

      "Omar Berrada: \"It's establishing a series of targets within a timeframe so we can focus our efforts and energy on that goal. Can the team win the Premier League title by 2028? Of course. We've just finished 15th and it seems an impossible task. But why not aim for it?\"",
      "Tuesday 17 June 2025 10:54, UK",
      "Manchester United chief executive Omar Berrada remains confident the club can mark their 150th anniversary in 2028 by winning both the men’s and women’s league titles and believes there are similarities between head coach Ruben Amorim and Man City boss Pep Guardiola.",
      "Berrada, who first told staff of his \"Project 150\" vision in September last year, knows that represents a significant challenge with United having just endured a worst top-flight season since relegation in 1973-74, while Chelsea continue to dominate the Women's Super League.",
      "However, he believes marking a major milestone in the club's history since it was founded as Newton Heath in 1878 with double title success is realistic.",
      "In an interview with the United We Stand fanzine to be published on Wednesday, Berrada said: \"It's establishing a series of targets within a timeframe so we can focus our efforts and energy on that goal.",
      "\"Can the team win the Premier League title by 2028? Of course.",
      "\"We've just finished 15th and it seems an impossible task. But why not aim for it? Why not do everything in our power?\"",
      "While United finished third in the WSL, 16 points behind champions Chelsea who also beat them in the FA Cup final, the men languished just three places above the Premier League relegation zone and lost the Europa League final to Tottenham.",
      "Nevertheless, Berrada has doubled down on his timetable.",
      "He said: \"I firmly believe we can do it.",
      "\"We have two or three summer windows to build a team to start competing to win the Premier League.",
      "\"Nobody is saying we don't want to win it until then. We're setting ourselves a target with a specific time frame to go and aim for.\"",
      "Berrada also reaffirmed Man Utd's commitment to women's football.",
      "\"We have been a bit distracted with all the issues around the men's first team but we are committed to making the women's team very successful,\" said Berrada.",
      "\"You've heard [minority owner] Jim [Ratcliffe] say 'if you're wearing the United shirt then you must win'. That's exactly how I feel. A club of our scale has a responsibility to grow football in general and contribute to women's football.\"",
      "Amorim has had a difficult start to life at Old Trafford since arriving from Sporting in November.",
      "And Berrada, who joined United after leaving his role as chief football operations officer at City Football Group, believes there are similarities between Amorim and Man City boss Guardiola, who had his own struggles in his first season at the Etihad.",
      "\"Very much so,\" Berrada said when asked if saw similarities between Amorim and Guardiola.",
      "\"It was difficult in Pep's first year.\"",
      "He added: \"He didn't win anything and there was suspicion about whether he could implement his football vision in the Premier League. People said he was arrogant and wouldn't change his style of play. But he stuck to his principles and given what he'd won, he had an enormous amount of credit in the bank.",
      "\"He was allowed that first year to be below-par by his standards. The club backed him that summer, the team started winning and created this winning cycle that lasted until this season.\"",
      "Berrada believes the difficulties Amorim has had to deal with will benefit the head coach and the club next season.",
      "\"It won't be easy,\" he said. \"There'll be some difficult moments ahead.",
      "\"Nothing is going to get solved with one summer window, but we are on the right path.",
      "\"We've put the worst part of this transformation phase behind us and now we're going to start building. I'm very confident we'll get back to the top.\"",

      "By Lyall Thomas and Dharmesh Sheth",
      "Tuesday 17 June 2025 06:07, UK",
      "Manchester United are relaxed about their pursuit of Bryan Mbeumo despite being aware of Tottenham's interest in the Brentford forward.",
      "United are expected to go back in with another offer for Mbeumo after having their initial bid worth up to £55m rejected. It remains to be seen whether Tottenham will follow up their initial talks or move on to Bournemouth's Antoine Semenyo.",
      "Brentford value Mbeumo, who effectively has two years left on his deal, at more than £60m and are willing to listen to offers.",
      "United have other targets in Mbeumo's position, including Semenyo, and have their own values in mind for both players.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo scored 20 goals in the Premier League last season to help Brentford secure a top-half finish - only three players scored more.",
      "He also notched seven assists but should have registered more, clocking a league-topping 9.26 expected assists during the campaign - primarily from delivering a table-topping 202 crosses.",
      "Additionally, only two players covered more distance or attempted more sprints for the season, making him one of the hardest grafters in the league. He also provides serious pace - clocking the fourth-fastest speed at 36.63 km/h.",
      "Factoring in decisive goals or assists that changed the outcomes of games, his 27 goal contributions earned Brentford 22 points - equating to 40 per cent of the Bees' season tally.",
      "Mbeumo can also create something from nothing. According to expected goals (xG), he scored nearly eight goals more than the quality of chances presented to him last season - more than any other player in the Premier League.",
