      "Amad has defended his decision to show the middle finger to supporters during Manchester United's post-season tour. The United forward went viral after a video of him swearing towards fans in Malaysia was widely shared on social media.",
      "The incident happened outside United's hotel in Kuala Lumpur, with the club in the Malaysian capital to play the ASEAN All-Stars in a friendly on Wednesday. United went on to lose the game 1-0 - and their disastrous trip wasn't helped by the negative attention brought by Amad's actions.",
      "However, the club have defended the 22-year-old, who they say was responding to \"serious personal abuse\" about his mother. Amad himself wrote on X: \"I have respect for people but not for the one who insults my mom…",
      "\"I shouldn't have reacted like that but I don't regret what I did. We had a great time in Malaysia with good people.\"",
      "The abuse happened while United's players left the team hotel for their coach. There was a large group of supporters gathered to greet them and, in one of the videos on social media, they can be heard shouting Amad's name in an effort to get his attention.",
      "It is understood that what Amad took offense to wasn't racist, but rather that fans were shouting \"Diallo\" at him. The Ivory Coast international has previously requested to be known solely by his first name, following some controversy involving a trafficking case from his time at previous club Atalanta.",
      "Amad was fined £42,000 by the Italian FA in 2021 after an investigation into allegations he used false documents and fake parents to get into Italy. United signed him for an initial fee of £19million - which could rise to £37m - from Atalanta in January 2021 and, after a successful loan spell at Sunderland, he has become a regular first-team player.",
      "He will be involved when United play Hong Kong in the second of their post-season tour games, which have been embarked upon to earn the struggling club around £7.8m.",
      "Having used 25 outfield players in the embarrassing loss in Malaysia, Ruben Amorim will again rotate his team against Hong Kong, albeit without Harry Maguire, Diogo Dalot and Andre Onana, who have flown on to a fan engagement event in India.",
      "United did not shy away from the Amad incident in Kuala Lumpur, having put him up for the press conference in Hong Kong, where he fielded questions about his close friend Alejandro Garnacho, who is expected to leave the club this summer.",
      "“Alejandro is a really good player and we need good players in the team,” Amad told reporters when asked if he hoped Garnacho might stay. “I know Garna really well, so I hope to have Garna next season. It is not really a big issue for the team. Everything is good now.\"",
      "Speaking about his plans for the Hong Kong match, Amorim said: “I will try to divide because I don’t want all the young kids all together. I will try to mix these things. We want to be competitive. If they are fit, they will play, and we will have the maximum respect for everybody here and for our fans.”",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more."

      "The Red Devils finished 15th in the Premier League, marking their worst season in 51 years. The club will earn £8million from this trip to the Far East and while Amorim acknowledges the importance of tours such as this for him and the players to connect with United’s worldwide fanbase, there is clearly a big part of him that just wants this season to be over.",
      "“We want to give something to the fans, but it’s hard in this moment – we just want to turn the page and improve next season,” he said at a press conference on Thursday.",
      "“We cannot hide that it is really tough in this moment for us not to close the season, but if there is one thing that is really important in this club it is that we need to face our fans in this moment, and we need to give something to our fans around the world.”",
      "Amorim is again expected to heavily rotate his squad for the match against Hong Kong. Three senior players – Harry Maguire, Diogo Dalot and Andre Onana – have flown on to a fan engagement event in India so are unavailable, while Luke Shaw is injured.",

      "Ruben Amorim struggled to hide himself laughing after hearing a question about the possibility of Alejandro Garnacho staying at Manchester United. Garnacho is on United’s post-season tour, despite being poised to leave after Amorim told him that he doesn’t feature in his plans for next season.",
      "It is an awkward situation for both player and manager following a falling out that will lead to Garnacho’s departure in the summer transfer window. United are ready to listen to offers for any of their squad following a desperate season, in which they finished 15th in the Premier League and lost the Europa League final.",
      "Garnacho is at the top of the list to sell after reacting badly to being left on the bench for the final against Spurs. He was then left out of the squad for United’s 2-0 win over Aston Villa on the final day of the season and is ready to quit United once the transfer window opens, with Napoli the frontrunners for his signature.",
      "Nevertheless, Amorim took the 20-year-old winger on United’s tour of Malaysia and Hong Kong, where he has cut the figure of a moody teenager, reluctantly signing autographs before playing in the embarrassing 1-0 defeat by ASEAN All-Stars on Wednesday.",
      "His exit appears as good as inevitable – and Amorim’s reaction after hearing Amad posed a question about Garnacho in a press conference in Hong Kong summed up the mood. While the reporter asked the United forward if he hoped his friend would stay for the 2025/26 campaign, Amorim was spotted trying to stifle a laugh with his hand.",
      "Amad then answered: \"Alejandro is a really good player and we need good players in the team. I know Garna really well, so I hope to have Garna next season. It is not really a big issue for the team. Everything is good now.\"",
      "Amorim has been unhappy with Garnacho’s attitude in recent weeks and is more than happy to sanction his exit. United rejected a £40million bid from Napoli in January for the Argentina international, but will hold talks with the Italian champions’ sporting director Giovanni Manna once they return from Hong Kong.",
      "The United boss batted away suggestions that it was odd he would bring Garnacho on the trip, given his status. “It is not a surprise,” he said. “He is a player of Manchester United – all the players are here. Some players are injured and it was better for them not to fly here to play these two games. It is a normal situation.\"",
      "United are desperate to generate funds for their summer overhaul and Garnacho is on the transfer list along with Marcus Rashford, Antony and Jadon Sancho following their loan spells at other clubs. Garnacho, who is under contract until June 2028, is valued at around £70m after getting 11 goals and 10 assists in 58 games this season.",

      "Alan Shearer has expressed worries about the \"rows\" between Manchester United and Wolves concerning Matheus Cunha's potential transfer to Old Trafford. It's been indicated for some time that the Brazil international will be joining United, but recent hiccups have emerged that could jeopardise the move.",
      "Ruben Amorim has been braced to enter his first summer transfer window at the United helm with limited resources. And funding is sure to suffer further after their defeat against Tottenham in the Europa League final, leaving the club with no European football next season.",
      "United now need to sell certain players before they can afford to spend any significant sums. And Newcastle legend Shearer raised doubts regarding United's prospects of securing Cunha amid recent developments.",
      "\"Who they sell, I don't know. If they need to raise funds then they have a couple of options to do that,\" he told Betfair. \"It looks as if the Cunha deal is going to happen albeit I saw that there's rows in terms of how payments will be made.\"",
      "The transfer saga seems to have taken a positive turn after United agreed to shell out the £62.5m fee in three payments spread over two years. Cunha is now poised to have his medical at Carrington, potentially marking United's most significant acquisition of 2025.",
      "The former RB Leipzig and Atletico Madrid attacker has an impressive record of 33 goals in 92 games for Wolves and offers much-needed versatility up top. Meanwhile, Shearer has cautioned that there's still a hefty amount of squad rebuilding necessary before United can dream of fighting for a top-six finish again.",
      "He continued: \"Man United need an overhaul but it won't happen in one or two transfer windows and that's why, as a player, you have to think long and hard about needing or wanting to go there because it's going to take two or three years to get anywhere near the levels to challenge for the top six again.",
      "\"If funds are going to be tight due to PSR then their assets in [Alejandro] Garnacho and [Bruno] Fernandes may have to be sold to bring funds in. Nothing surprises me with Man United on or off the field anymore because they've been an embarrassment over the last 12 months.\"",
      "Cunha himself has dropped a big hint he's preparing to leave after seemingly bidding farewell to his Wolves supporters. The club's official Instagram account featured a clip of the Molineux faithful serenading the star following their last game of the campaign, and Cunha’s response seemed to indicate plans for departure.",
      "\"I can't thank you enough for so much,\" he wrote in the comments section. And many have interpreted his words as an indication his tenure in the midlands is nearing its conclusion.",
      "Garnacho, 20, has been placed on the transfer list following a fallout with Amorim, who excluded him from the squad that beat Aston Villa on the final day of the season. There's talk United are aiming to bag up to £70m for the youngster, although their negotiating stance seems frail.",
      "United will undoubtedly be keener to cling on to captain Fernandes, who was previously rumoured to be on the radars of Barcelona and Real Madrid. Meanwhile, a move to Saudi Arabia now appears to be the most probable outcome if he were to depart."

      "Manchester United’s failure to sign their 'top target' Florian Wirtz is set to come back to haunt them as Liverpool close in on the German sensation. Liverpool are currently in talks with Bayer Leverkusen after convincing Wirtz and his representatives that his future lies in Merseyside.",
      "The 22-year-old's family recently flew to Liverpool to look at houses in the north west of England, having been impressed with Arne Slot’s vision for him and the Premier League winners going forward.",
      "The Reds have since submitted an opening bid of £85million plus add-ons for the Germany international after receiving the green light from owners Fenway Sports Group. That sum falls short of Leverkusen’s valuation of the player, with the German side understood to be holding out for a deal that would break the Premier League transfer record, set by Chelsea’s £115m move for Moises Caicedo in 2023.",
      "Yet, Wirtz’s preference to join Liverpool over Bayern Munich means the Premier League champions are very much the frontrunners in the race to secure their long-term target’s signature, with negotiations between the two clubs continuing and an agreement likely very soon.",
      "Such news will be particularly poorly received in certain Manchester circles after they passed up the opportunity to sign him three-and-a-half years ago.",
      "During Ralf Rangnick’s brief spell in charge at Old Trafford, the then-interim manager compiled a lengthy list of his top transfer targets for the United hierarchy to bring in.",
      "Rangnick was appointed in December 2021 and was expected to start a two-year consultancy gig once a permanent successor was identified at the end of the season. Ahead of his first transfer window at the helm in January 2022, his wishlist included the likes of Josko Gvardiol, Christopher Nkunku and Erling Haaland.",
      "But an 18-year-old Wirtz was the German’s priority target. Wirtz at the time was enjoying a meteoric rise at Leverkusen, becoming the club’s youngest ever player in the Bundesliga with his debut coming shortly after his 17th birthday in March 2020. With eight goals and eight assists the following season, he earned a call-up to the senior Germany squad in March 2021.",
      "Rangnick had hoped the draw of the Premier League and Old Trafford could persuade Wirtz to join United. Reports claimed a transfer fee of £60m would have been sufficient to convince Leverkusen to part ways.",
      "United, however, opted against making any signings in January 2022, much to the frustration of Rangnick. And the interim boss left the club in May after winning just 11 of his 31 games, ending the Red Devils’ pursuit of Wirtz.",
      "Since then, the attacking-midfielder has gone on to become one of European football’s brightest talents thanks to his performances under Xabi Alonso. He played a pivotal role as Leverkusen completed an unbeaten domestic double last season, which put him on the radar of clubs like Bayern Munich, Manchester City and Chelsea.",
      "Newly-crowned German champions Bayern were quietly confident that they could complete a deal this summer for Wirtz, who is under contract with Leverkusen until 2027. However, that fell apart after Wirtz and his parents – who represent him in negotiations – met with Bayern chief Max Eberl, club supremo Uli Hoeness and head coach Vincent Kompany.",
      "It is understood that they left the meeting feeling underwhelmed and with a lack of clarity around Bayern's plans for him. The opposite happened when they met with Liverpool, who impressed due to a depth of knowledge around Wirtz, allowing them to push ahead in the queue.",
      "Leverkusen’s managing director Simon Rolfes this week confirmed that Liverpool hold “concrete interest” in him. \"[Wirtz is] one of our players,\" Rolfes said at the press conference to unveil new head coach Erik ten Hag on Monday. \"Naturally, there’s a lot of interest. There’s concrete interest from Liverpool but there’s no more to say right now. Florian is our player.”",
      "The blockbuster deal for Wirtz is just one part of Liverpool’s plans for the summer transfer window, with his Leverkusen team-mate Jeremie Frimpong also heading for Anfield in a £29.5m deal, while Bournemouth defender Milos Kerkez is also of interest. Their potential arrivals is clear evidence of the pulling power of winning, with Slot able to convince players following his Premier League title victory.",
      "On the plus side for United and Ruben Amorim, they are edging close to completing the signing of Matheus Cunha from Wolves for £62.5m, with a medical on the way for the Brazilian attacker.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more."

That’s the opinion of former United midfielder Gordon Strachan, who has urged the club to sell Garnacho at the earliest opportunity in the summer transfer window.",
      "Garnacho is an unwilling participant on United’s post-season tour to Malaysia and Hong Kong and is desperate to leave the club following a miserable end to the season. United finished 15th in the Premier League and lost the Europa League final to Tottenham and will undergo a major squad overhaul in the coming months.",

      "That would be a good move for all parties involved, according to ex-manager Strachan, who slammed Garnacho’s attitude. \"Garnacho's got to go. I think he shows a lack of maturity and needs a real wake-up call. Manchester United is far too good of a club to listen to him whingeing and whining all the time,” he told Esports Insider.",
      "\"You wonder what the players at Manchester United are thinking about Alejandro Garnacho’s actions. He should be looking after his team-mates after they lost the Europa League final, not promoting himself with his comments.",
      "\"If he doesn’t want to be a team player then I think it’s best he just goes somewhere else. If the manager decides he's not picking you, you've got to think of the reason, and quite often that starts by looking at yourself.",
      "\"In life the best thing to do when something isn't going your way, or you have issues, is to look at yourself and think whether it stems from you. It's rare that players take that stance anymore, and look at themselves before whining about their problems.\"",
      "Napoli sporting director Giovanni Manna will reportedly meet United officials in the coming weeks to begin the negotiation process over Garnacho. The Italian champions saw a £40million bid rejected in January and have been told that United value the Argentina international at closer to £70m.",
      "The club are hoping to net a decent transfer fee, given the 20-year-old is under contract until June 2028 and he contributed 11 goals and 10 assists in 58 games this season.",

The young Lions get their campaign under way with a match against Czechia on June 12 and, with Chelsea willing to pay his £30m release clause, it seems a deal could be done quickly.",
      "United are close to announcing a £62.5m deal to sign Matheus Cunha from Wolves, but had hoped to capture Delap as well in a double swoop. It seems as though their Europa League final failure and subsequent embarrassing defeat by ASEAN All-Stars in Kuala Lumpur is working against them.",
      "“Liam’s looking at his options for next year, which I think he is entitled to do and we support him with that,” Ipswich manager Kieran McKenna said at a press conference before their final game of the season.",

      "“It looks more likely than not that he will move on this summer and he has interest from pretty much every club in the league, and I don’t think there are many clubs in the world who wouldn’t want to have him. (However) nothing is sorted, nothing is done or completed or even very, very, very close, so that process will take its course.”",

      "Manchester United have a huge summer ahead of them after what has been a tragic season. The Red Devils finished a lowly 15th in the Premier League having lost 18 games throughout the campaign.",
      "They also failed to seal an unlikely return to the Champions League as they lost out to Tottenham in the Europa League final earlier this month. That looked set to be a huge blow to United’s hopes of a huge rebuild this summer.",
      "But that might be slightly premature, with club chiefs already putting lofty plans in place for the upcoming summer transfer window. United could choose to spend heavily to bolster their side over the coming months, with a series of lucrative signings potentially in the pipeline.",
      "So, what could Ruben Amorim’s side look like on the first day of next season?",
      "Starting in goal, there’s a debate over the future of Andre Onana. The Cameroon goalkeeper has been blighted by a series of errors since his big-money arrival from Inter Milan. And United could look to move him on amid interest from Saudi and raid relegated Leicester for Mads Hermansen. The Dane has shone during the past two seasons in the Midlands and could potentially be available for around £35m.",
      "Moving into defence, the Red Devils look pretty well set. They spent huge fees on Leny Yoro and Matthijs de Ligt last summer and the pair look set to be a key part of the defence.",
      "The same could also be said of Lisandro Martinez, who looks likely to recover from the serious knee injury he picked up earlier this season. Patrick Dorgu should also remain in the side despite a slow start to life at Old Trafford. A number of defenders could consequently leave the club including Tyrell Malacia, Jonny Evans and Victor Lindelof - the latter two having already confirmed their departures.",
      "Midfield could however look very different come next season. Atalanta midfielder Ederson has long been linked with a move to the Premier League, with Liverpool among those interested. United could muscle in on their rivals’ interest but it won’t be cheap with the Serie A side having put a £63m price tag on the Brazilian. Manuel Ugarte looks set to be a key player under Ruben Amorim - particularly in games where that greater level of midfield graft, rather than craft, is required, after acclimatising to life in the Premier League.",
      "Who should Man United sign this summer? Share your suggestions in the comments below",
      "But question marks remain over Casemiro, despite his impressive displays towards the end of the season. Regarding other midfield exits, Christian Eriksen has already departed, while the future of Kobbie Mainoo remains up in the air. Bruno Fernandes could also be among those to leave - albeit Amorim and United chiefs will be desperate to keep the Portuguese playmaker amid serious interest from Saudi Arabia.",
      "United’s season this term really stumbled due to their lack of goal threat and that could see the club completely transform their frontline. On-loan stars Antony, Marcus Rashford and Jadon Sancho could all be sold permanently.",
      "They could be joined by Alejandro Garnacho, Rasmus Hojlund and Joshua Zirkzee in leaving. The first attacking signing of the new era looks set to be Wolves star Matheus Cunha, who will likely put pen to paper at Old Trafford after United activated a £62.5m release clause in his deal.",
      "He could also be joined by fellow Premier League star Bryan Mbeumo. Reports have suggested that the Red Devils have opened talks for a £50m deal for the 20-goal forward but they could face competition from Newcastle.",
      "Finally, a new central striker could be on the agenda for United. Liam Delap is among the targets, albeit Chelsea look to be moving ahead in the race for the Ipswich star.",
      "That could potentially see United move their crosshairs to Victor Osimhen, who has spent the past season with Turkish side Galatasaray. And he could be available for as little as £51m this summer. He would be the ideal replacement to solve the club’s goalscoring issue following another brilliant campaign.",
      "Potential Man United XI: Hermansen; Yoro, De Ligt, Martinez; Dalot, Ederson, Fernandes, Dorgu; Mbeumo, Cunha; Osimhen.",

      "It never looked like a good idea, but it is turning out to be much worse than expected.",
      "After concluding their miserable 2024-25 season, Manchester United flew over 6,600 miles to Kuala Lumpur for marketing reasons. Having deemed 60 largely disappointing matches inadequate, United’s brains trust signed their demoralised squad up for two more.",
      "“Importantly, tour fixtures drive significant additional revenue which help make the club stronger, allowing us to keep investing in success on the pitch,” chief executive Omar Berrada said plainly when the club announced the genius plan in early April.",
      "Back then, there must have already been nagging worries that United’s decision-makers were signing their club up for another dose of embarrassment. All for the estimated revenue of $10million (£7.8m) the trip will make for United.",
      "This is the reality of the Sir Jim Ratcliffe era : a penny-pinching petrochemicals billionaire. A man worth $16.7bn (£12.4bn), according to Forbes, making hundreds of staff redundant and sending his exhausted players halfway across the world to appease sponsors and spread the good word of United.",
      "That £7.8m is suddenly looking like a bad deal. The malaise that engulfed the club this season became even darker and thicker with the 1-0 defeat by Tottenham in the Europa League final and has now become a pervasive presence; an unwanted 12th man on the pitch.",
      "Videos of Alejandro Garnacho half-heartedly signing autographs and other players trudging heads down past screaming fans were bad enough before the actual football – ostensibly the reason for their visit – was taken into account.",
      "United somehow managed to lose 1-0 to the ASEAN All Stars in Bukit Jalil National Stadium on Wednesday. Ruben Amorim used 25 outfield players, but was powerless to stop Maung Maung Lwin – a Burmese player who plies his trade in the Thai League – from providing the game’s only goal.",
      "Many of the 84,000 people who turned up in the Malaysian capital, some of whom had paid £260 for a ticket, booed them off the pitch. In a season of crushing lows, United had somehow managed to plumb new depths. This was embarrassing – and it is obvious who was to blame.",
      "United have set their players up for failure with this ridiculous money-grabbing PR disaster. Even if they had enjoyed a good domestic campaign, or if they had beaten Spurs in Bilbao, the players would not have been up for this trip. There is a reason this is the first time United have embarked on a post-season tour.",
      "This one is only a few days old and it is already backfiring in potentially spectacular fashion. While Matheus Cunha is too far down the line to change his mind over a £62.5m transfer from Wolves to United, other targets are not. United better hope they are enjoying their holiday so much that they haven’t bothered opening social media or reading the newspapers.",
      "Because does anyone really want to join this mess? They are a rubbish football team right now, but more than that, they are a miserable and disunited bunch. They will become a revolving door this summer, shipping out scores of players while scrabbling around for anyone who will join them. They won’t play any European football next season and Carrington is reportedly a vibe vacuum, having had the life sucked out of it by Ratcliffe’s staff purge.",
      "This is the context which players like Liam Delap must currently be assessing. Delap is poised to leave Ipswich for £30m this summer. He is understood to be choosing between United and Chelsea – a decision which currently looks extremely straightforward.",
      "While United ended the season as a representation of the “This is fine” meme, everything burning around them, Chelsea did so with a European trophy and a place in next season’s Champions League secured.",
      "Ratcliffe has frequently, and in public, lamented the way things were done at United. He has made decisions he deems unpopular but necessary. But what he seems to fail to understand is that perception matters. Yes, he may have succeeded in putting the club on a more even footing financially, but at what cost?",
      "This ludicrous post-season tour is a perfect example of the Ratcliffe era so far: commercially astute yet visually unappealing. It could be extremely damaging to the planned squad overhaul this summer.",

      "Worries over Alejandro Garnacho's attitude could land him a spot on the Manchester United departures list this summer. And one former Carrington coach appeared to hint at the South American's penchant for petulance years ago.",
      "Murmurs have been building that Ruben Amorim is ready to sell Garnacho, who was dropped for United's final game of the season against Aston Villa. The Daily Mail reported that on the eve of that fixture, Amorim hung the 20-year-old out to dry in front of his team-mates and told him: \"You better pray that you can find a club to sign you.\"",
      "Justin Cochrane was part of the academy setup when Garnacho helped guide United's under-18s to the FA Youth Cup crown in 2022. The Argentina international was named Jimmy Murphy Young Player of the Year in the same season, but his temperament perhaps didn't always match his on-field performance.",
      "Cochrane, who has since moved to become first-team coach at Brentford, stopped short of hanging his former protege out to dry. But even on the path to success three years ago, there were comments pointing to potential flaws in a then-17-year-old Garnacho's character.",
      "Speaking to Goal in March 2022 about keeping the clearly talented winger grounded, Cochrane said: \"I have a good relationship with Garnacho, and he knows that if he crosses the line, I'll come get him!\"",
      "The former QPR and Rotherham defender paralleled that comment by saying he and his staff were \"pleased\" with the player. But even then, talk diverted to ensuring the player's ego remained grounded, something one might not hear unless there were already concerns in that area.",
      "\"My job and the staff’s job is to keep players grounded and keep their eyes on the prize,\" added Cochrane. \"Not just the youth prize, but the bigger prize of being in the first team and having a sustained career at a high level, so that’s what we’re focusing on with Garna.\"",
      "Amorim isn't the first United boss to take issue with Garnacho's behaviour. The Madrid-born star was previously reprimanded by Erik ten Hag after he 'liked' social media posts critical of his half-time substitution in a 2-2 draw against Bournemouth last April.",
      "Ten Hag later said his player had apologised over the incident, suggesting they had moved on from the ordeal. However, Garnacho was later dropped by the Dutchman in September 2024, not long before he was fired, for once again liking posts critical of Ten Hag.",
      "Given Cochrane's comments from 2022, it points to a pattern of behaviour most coaches would rather do without. And it appears Amorim has had the last straw, with the player seemingly free to leave if a suitable offer comes in.",
      "Napoli have been strongly linked with the player in recent transfer windows. However, that move could be in jeopardy amid reports Antonio Conte is prepared to leave the club after just one season, in which he secured the Serie A crown.",
      "That could leave the Red Devils scrambling to find a suitor for the player willing to meet their valuation. And that list could only grow shorter if teams looking to invest are at all unsettled when it comes to Garnacho's personality."

      "The race is on and instead of taking the steady approach of a marathoner, several of the Premier League’s giants are out of the blocks like sprinters.",
      "It was not until the third week of last summer’s transfer window that the traditional big six completed a signing - with Tosin Adarabioyo joining Chelsea as a free agent and Lucas Bergvall arriving at Tottenham from Djurgarden on July 1.",
      "But already this summer - despite the window not opening until Sunday - Manchester United have made their £62.5m move for Matheus Cunha, Liverpool have done a deal for Jeremie Frimpong with Florian Wirtz possibly following along the path from Leverkusen, and Arsenal are putting the wheels in motion to add the striker they so desperately need.",
      "The calendar is undoubtedly a factor behind this active start. Last summer’s window began the same time as the Euros, this year’s starts early and pauses briefly to factor in Chelsea and Manchester City’s participation in the Club World Cup.",
      "But it is hard to ignore the two other major circumstances prompting this early rush into action.",
      "Top of the list is the chase for goalscorers. The absence of a prolific No9 was the main reason behind Arsenal being unable to prolong their title challenge. A centre-forward capable of finding the net would have eased the crisis at United. Chelsea’s biggest weakness is the absence of a ruthless finisher. And even Liverpool have rued Darwin Nunez’s misfiring.",
      "They are all fighting for a dwindling number of strikers, which is why Liam Delap is commanding such interest after one good season for a team that won just four games all season. Chelsea are keen, so too United, and the Ipswich player’s representatives have already been holding talks with a number of clubs, pointing to a speedy resolution.",
      "Swedish striker Viktor Gyokeres, meanwhile, looks destined for north London as Mikel Arteta hopes to add the final piece after the Gunners’ rate of improvement slowed to incremental. That is another transfer that is expected to be completed early in the window - with the Arsenal hierarchy no doubt wary of losing out on their top target. They are also expected to announce the signing of Martin Zubimendi from Real Sociedad early on.",
      "Yet it is not all about the supply and demand of strikers. By ending Manchester City’s era of dominance, Liverpool have opened up a window for their rivals to win a title. This time last year most clubs will have been dreaming but not necessarily believing that they could unseat Pep Guardiola’s side.",
      "Now they are all certain they can do what Arne Slot’s side managed – if they can get the recruitment right. That is why this window could have long-term repercussions, why the gap between success and failure is so thin and we could look back on 2025 a few seasons from now as a period that defined an era.",
      "And that is before considering the long-held fact that the ability to have new acquisitions report for duty at the beginning of pre-season rather than arriving a couple of games into the campaign is rather valuable. Just do not expect a hectic deadline day if the business is completed early."

      "Marcus Rashford’s representatives have reportedly held talks with Barcelona over a possible transfer this summer. Rashford is seeking a permanent exit from Manchester United this summer after a fruitful but brief loan spell at Aston Villa and is keen to join Barcelona.",
      "The 27-year-old forward was shipped out on loan to Villa in January by Ruben Amorim, who froze him out of the first-team squad at Old Trafford. He responded well, contributing four goals and six assists in 17 appearances for Villa to revitalise his career following a fallow spell at United.",
      "His boyhood club have made it clear that they will sell the England international for £40million this summer, with Amorim needing to shift fringe players to reinvest the funds in his underperforming squad. United are, in fact, ready to listen to offers for any of their players, although selling loanees Rashford, Jadon Sancho and Antony remains a priority.",
      "Rashford wants to get his future sorted quickly, otherwise he will have to report for pre-season with United in early July. The problem is that he is being paid £350,000 per week by United on a contract which runs until June 2028 – terms that no other club will meet.",
      "Nevertheless, Barca appear to be interested, with SPORT reporting that the club’s sporting director Deco met with Rashford’s agent at a hotel in the city on Wednesday morning. Barca are understood to prefer the signing of Liverpool winger Luis Diaz, but Rashford could be a more realistic option, given United want to sell and Liverpool don’t.",
      "\"We like Luis, we like Rashford, and we like other players,\" Deco told Catalan radio station RAC 1 recently. \"Out of respect, talking about players who are under contract with other clubs is complicated. When we go to the market, there are names we know that could improve the team.\"",
      "Diaz’s father has previously said it would be a “dream” for his son to join Barca, although the winger has a contract until June 2027 and he recently reaffirmed his happiness on Merseyside after winning the Premier League.",
      "Barcelona will be guided by their financial issues this summer and will likely push for a loan move for Rashford, which could mean a prolonged bargaining period between the two clubs. The Catalan giants have prioritised signing their key players up to new contracts and star wingers Lamine Yamal and Raphinha have already committed their futures to the club following their La Liga win.",
      "\"If we can keep the core of the team together, that's what we want,\" Deco explained. \"I think we can do it. I think you can always improve the team, but you have to understand what kind of player you need. We've focused first on what we have at home and renewals.",
      "\"The renewals of Raphinha, [Frenkie] De Jong, and Eric [Garcia] will come, for sure. That's the priority. We'll talk about improving the team if we can, but the key is stability. We don't believe that players will ask to leave.\"",

      "Manchester United are set to miss out on the signing of Ipswich Town striker Liam Delap amid his preference to join Chelsea.",
      "United had identified the 22-year-old as an attainable target to strengthen their attacking options ahead of next season after Ipswich's relegation triggered a £30million release clause in his contract.",
      "The former Manchester City youngster, as well as being the subject of interest from United and Chelsea, has also held talks with Everton and Newcastle United recently. He scored 12 Premier League goals this season.",
      "With United now set to miss out on the former Stoke City and Hull City loanee, MEN Sport has picked out five alternatives who the Reds could potentially consider to spearhead their attack.",
      "United have been linked with Brentford star Bryan Mbeumo this week, but news of Delap's expected switch to Stamford Bridge could force the Reds to target one of his teammates instead.",
      "Wissa, 28, scored 19 Premier League goals this season, successfully filling the void that had been vacated by Ivan Toney last summer. He led Brentford's attack throughout the season and was only outscored by Mohamed Salah (29), Alexander Isak (23), Erling Haaland (22), Chris Wood (20) and Mbeumo (20) in the Premier League.",
      "The former FC Lorient man also scored 12 times in the Premier League last season, meaning his tally of 32 over the last two seasons means he has netted more top flight goals in that period than Mbeumo, who so often dominates the Brentford headlines.",

His contract at the Gtech Community Stadium is up in 2026, but Brentford have the option of an additional year, which they would almost certainly trigger to protect his soaring valuation.",
      "Like Wissa, Mateta is another striker who exceeded expectations for one of the Premier League's mid-table clubs this season, scoring 17 goals across all competitions, of which 14 were netted in the league.",
      "Since initially arriving at Selhurst Park on loan in January 2021, the Frenchman's all-round game has improved, and that has been reflected in his increased attacking output. After scoring 16 goals in the Premier League last season, his tally of 14 this time around demonstrates that he is now an established goal-getter.",
      "Under contract at Palace until 2027, Mateta is excellent at holding the ball up and bringing others into play, meaning he could be an ideal fit for Ruben Amorim's team, where the two No.10s are tasked with operating close to the central striker.",
      "If United decide that Mateta is a realistic alternative to Delap, the problem they could face is that Palace have European football to offer the striker next season after qualifying for the Europa League via their FA Cup triumph at Wembley earlier this month. Being unable to offer European football at Old Trafford could hold United back in their search for a striker.",
      "Strikers of David's pedigree do not come on the market all that often. The fact he is available for free this summer after deciding to leave Lille means that he will be a very attractive option for a number of clubs.",
      "The Canadian spent five years at Lille, scoring 109 goals in 232 appearances, establishing himself as one of Europe's most consistent goalscorers. United have been heavily linked with him in the past and he would be an excellent signing on a free transfer.",
      "However, David played in the Champions League this season and scored seven goals in ten appearances, meaning he will have aspirations of playing in the competition again next season. The likes of Liverpool, Newcastle and Barcelona have all been linked with him and will each play in the Champions League in 2025/26.",
      "It means United are highly unlikely to be able to lure David to M16, even though he would not require a transfer fee. It is when you look at players of his ilk that you begin to grasp a real understanding of just how costly failing to qualify for the Champions League could be.",
      "United have been linked with Osimhen countless times in previous years and now would be as good a time as any to bring him to Old Trafford. He will leave Napoli this summer on a permanent basis after falling out with head coach Antonio Conte almost a year ago.",
      "He spent this season on loan at Turkish side Galatasaray and scored a whopping 36 goals in 40 matches across all competitions. He also racked up eight assists.",
      "Already being linked with Saudi Arabian outfit Al-Hilal, United may face a race against the clock to try and lure him to Old Trafford. Some reports have claimed he could be available for around €40m.",
      "In this modern era, a fee in that region for a goalscorer as prolific as Osimhen, who is entering the prime of his career at the age of 26, represents good value. He has scored 84 goals since the beginning of the 2022/23 season for Napoli and Galatasaray combined.",
      "However, a lack of European football could hold United back. He scored six times in seven Europa League appearances this season."

      "For the second Wednesday running, Manchester United had to traipse past dignitaries to collect their silver medals.",
      "The Maybank Challenge Cup was not exactly coveted. It was on the table in a room adjacent to the press conference room. Three of us requested a picture with it, so a few from Manchester managed to get their hands on the trophy.",
      "Some United players tried to make a quick getaway after full-time. Dave Harrison, the director of football operations who finds himself chaperoning United players around stadiums, reminded them to observe the post-match procession.",
      "After United collected their medals, Casemiro, Alejandro Garnacho, Harry Amass and Toby Collyer again tried to make their exit. But no, they were ushered back onto the pitch to observe the trophy lift by the ASEAN All Stars.",
      "Incongruously, the 1997 non-classic Sing Up For The Champions, an official single released by United when they actually were champions, was played as United collected their medals. The lyrics refer to winning the Football League again in Merseyside and namecheck Ryan Giggs, Gary Pallister, Teddy Sheringham, Andy Cole, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and Roy Keane.",
      "Amorim clasped hands and received a warm embrace from the United chief executive Omar Berrada when he collected his medal. He removed it immediately.",
      "\"My biggest concern is that we need to have the feeling that we need to win every game,\" Ruben Amorim said, \"even a small-sided game on the street, that kind of feeling every game, every exercise that is what we have to do to push the players.\"",
      "Nobody feels sorry for the United players after the season they have subjected their supporters to. Whether these players stay or go, the humiliation of losing a final to Tottenham and then to fire blanks again in Malaysia a week later is form that warrants boos.",
      "The last time United were booed on domestic soil was at half-time against Leicester City in the FA Cup fourth round back in February. Leicester somehow lost to United four times in 2024-25 but they threatened a shock that night until Harry Maguire made the most of a linesman's myopia.",
      "Since then, United matchgoers have sworn by harmonious atmospheres. Their end in the San Mames Stadium emptied quicker than a bathtub of water, which was their form of expressing disapproval. United fans are very dignified like that.",
      "Four days later against Aston Villa, there was no pre-match rancour and 'We'll never die' got an early and defiant airing. United also played well and won.",
      "In Kuala Lumpur, they were back on unwatchable form. Collyer was booed for playing the ball into touch with United 1-0 down. At full-time, there was more booing.",
      "Amorim understood it. \"I feel always guilty of the performance of the team since I am here in the first game,\" he admitted. \"I am guilty then the boos from the fans, maybe it is something we need because every game that we lost in the Premier League, they were always there. I felt when we finished every time the supporters were with us. Let's see for next season.\"",
      "There were 27 substitutions by Amorim alone. In an occasion that was as far removed from a competitive match as possible - a light show, a Mexican wave, innumerable substitutions - Rasmus Hojlund was still isolated, detached and sloppy.",
      "Hojlund left the Bukit Jalil National Stadium in a cheerful mood, cracking a brief joke with a United press officer. At Amorim's press conference, Hojlund was described as \"a shadow of himself\" and \"hesitant\" by a local reporter.",
      "Maybe Hojlund has seen the writing on the wall. United are waiting on a decision from Liam Delap, only four days younger than Hojlund. Delap would cost half the price, too. But if Delap returns to Manchester it will be to replace Hojlund.",
      "\"Sometimes you cannot overthink the situations,\" Amorim said in response to the query about Hojlund. \"Sometimes you go to holiday and then you arrive in the first day and you start a new season. Even the environment in the training ground can help all these players have more confidence.",
      "\"If you look at the data we improved in the last games. We have a lack of goals. We will try to assess that and be prepared.\"",
      "Amorim was already on the United coach when Garnacho strode out, sunglasses on, scanning his phone. Garnacho completely blanked those assembled in the mixed zone, which had descended more into a meet-and-greet pen.",
      "Amorim usually sits in the front row of the coach, so Garnacho will have had to have walked past him. Wearing sunglasses more befitting a superhero with midnight looming in Kuala Lumpur suggested he was trying to make a point.",
      "There is no power struggle between manager and player. It is a non-contest as United have backed Amorim after he told Garnacho that he can leave.",
      "Garnacho did, however, generate genuine adoration from the crowd, along with Bruno Fernandes, the renascent Harry Maguire and, somewhat peculiarly, Andre Onana. Onana, Maguire and Diogo Dalot are now bound for a commercial trek to India while their teammates head on to Hong Kong.",
      "Fernandes was the last to leave and he generously signed some shirts and stopped for pictures. United were in no rush. They were staying in the city another night after defeat.",
      "Just like they did last week."

      "Hello and welcome to the Manchester United transfer blog on Thursday, May 29.",
      "After yesterday's 1-0 defeat to ASEAN All-Stars in Malaysia on Wednesday, all focus will be back to the transfer business and what players will be signed to improve Ruben Amorim's team.",
      "Unfortunately, yesterday's big headline news was not a good one with Liam Delap now reportedly closing in on a move to Chelsea. It has always seemed to be United or Chelsea for the Ipswich Town star and the Londoners could be in pole position now.",
      "In better news, the list of players being linked with moves to Old Trafford continues to grow. Bryan Mbeumo, Ederson, Benjamin Sesko, Victor Osimhen, Hugo Ekitike and Moise Kean are all players reportedly on their radar.",
      "Away from United, Jadon Sancho helped Chelsea win the Conference League last night with a fine goal to make it 3-1. Talks are understood to be planned to start over his future now their season is over.",
      "Keep across all the United transfer updates and latest news in our dedicated blog below...",
      "After a disappointing 2024/25 campaign, Manchester United will have been hoping their transfer strategy to help move past this was watertight.",
      "So with United being dealt a considerable blow in landing one of their top two targets, MEN Sport writers have their say here on how United can move past Delap and find another suitable target.",
      "Everyone connected with Manchester United knows they must sign a striker this summer.",
      "It's why there may be some disconnect that the Reds have missed out on what looked to be a relatively simple deal to sign Ipswich Town's Liam Delap. Here is a player with Premier League experience who is available for £30million after the Tractor Boys' relegation to English football's second tier.",
      "But would a young striker like Delap be able to cope with the pressure of leading the line for Ruben Amorim's side? It's a responsibility that has weighed heavily on the shoulders of Rasmus Hojlund since arriving from Atalanta. Moving from Ipswich to Old Trafford would be a huge step up.",
      "Read the full piece here",
      "Manchester United have been handed an update on Kobbie Mainoo amid transfer speculation surrounding the midfielder.",
      "Reports in March from The Guardianclaimed that Mainoo is minded to reject the offer of a new contract at ­Old Trafford and seek a move abroad. With just two years left on his current deal, United might eventually have to sell. The Reds' PSR position will likely force their hand.",
      "It is claimed that United value Mainoo at around £70million, but the question is whether any foreign club would be able to afford that fee. Only Premier League clubs tend to pay that price, unless you are Real Madrid, who may be too big of a step up for the Englishman right now.",
      "Read more here",
      "Manchester United forward Jadon Sancho has sent a message on social media as his loan spell with Chelsea nears an end.",
      "Sancho relocated to west London on a season-long loan last summer, with the winger looking for a new lease of life after struggling at United since signing from Borussia Dortmund in 2021. Due to the Blues' Premier League position being higher than 14th, Chelsea are now obliged to purchase the forward for £25million.",
      "However, it is believed that there is a £5m break clause that can be paid to withdraw from the deal, which would result in Sancho returning to Old Trafford. If this occurs, it is understood that he will not be reintegrated back into the United squad.",
      "Read more here",
      "Man United and Man City are showing interest in Benfica goalkeeper Anatoliy Trubin, according to the Mirror US.",
      "The Portuguese side are willing to sell the Ukraine international for around £29.7m with the goalkeeper open to a move to the Premier League.",
      "The report adds that United would have made a move if they won the Europa League.",
      "In the last hour and a half we brought you reports that United are in Naples trying to organise a deal for Osimhen.",
      "From Napoli's perspective, while they are tough negotiators, they are also in a position where they need to sell Osimhen sooner rather than later.",
      "The Serie A champions have already started spending their money that they are looking to receive for the striker.",
      "Kevin De Bruyne, Jonathan David and Edon Zhegrova are all players that Napoli are reportedly working to sign.",
      "But, they are doing so hoping that Osimhen leaves so the sooner a deal is done the better and this could play into United's hands perfectly.",
      "According to The Athletic's David Ornstein, an agreement between Chelsea and Ipswich Town has been agreed for Delap.",
      "The Blues have activated Delap's £30m release clause ahead of his purchase.",
      "It is reported that personal terms still need to be agreed but no issue is expected there.",
      "For United, the Conference League final could not have gone much better.",
      "Before the game, Antony had already proven his worth ahead of the summer but there was still question marks about Sancho.",
      "Therefore, it did not matter that Antony had a quiet game, that will not affect the chances of him finding a new permanent home.",
      "Sancho needed to perform especially if, as is predicted, Chelsea will not pay £25m for him.",
      "He put himself in the shop window in the Conference League final and United will hope that this cameo will earn them a transfer fee if Chelsea pull out.",
      "In another blow for United, handed to them by Chelsea, it appears the Blues are leaning away from the idea of signing Sancho for £25m.",
      "According to The Guardian, as per their report on Delap choosing Chelsea over United, they believe that the Conference League holders are leaning towards not paying £25m for Sancho.",
      "While Enzo Maresca is thought to be a fan of the winger, he is believed to be unsure whether the forward is consistent enough.",
      "United now know that one of their main targets for this summer is destined to move to Chelsea.",
      "Fabrizio Romano understands that Chelsea's Champions League football next season was a contributing factor towards Delap wanting a move to Stamford Bridge.",
      "Our colleagues at football.london add that their current co-director of recruitment Joe Shields is a big fan of Delap having been at Manchester City when the forward signed from Derby County.",
      "According to Il Napolista, United are turning their attention to Napoli striker Victor Osimhen after missing out on Delap.",
      "It is claimed that recruitment chief Matt Hargreaves has flown to Naples to try and thrash out a deal for Osimhen.",
      "Napoli want to sell the talisman who scored 36 goals for Galatasaray on loan this season but will want Rasmus Hojlund in return, plus £33.5m.",
      "United were believed to have £30m saved up to activate Delap's release clause so it is not too much more that Ineos would need to stump up to bring the Nigerian to the Premier League.",
      "Hello and welcome back to the United transfer blog on Thursday afternoon.",

      "If you are just joining us today, here's a catch up on what you have missed:",
      "To kick us off here, there could be a Plan B starting to form as an alternative to Delap...",

      "Speaking in Malaysia, he said:",
      "I can't talk about specifics, but I can say we've been planning for many months now.",
      "We were ready for all the different scenarios. Now we know what we need to do. We have a very clear idea of where we need to invest in the squad to improve.",
      "So Jason [Wilcox], his team and Ruben have been in talks for many months. And now it's a question of executing that plan and doing it in a way that is prudent. But at the same time, with ambition.",
      "Saudi Pro League side Neom SC want to sign Andre Onana this summer, according to the Mirror.",
      "A fee of £35m is said to be the newly-promoted side's valuation of the goalkeeper, with a salary of £15m-per-year on the table for Onana.",
      "Neom is one of the club's backed by Newcastle's owners the Saudi Public Investment Fund.",
      "Liam Delap wants to join Chelsea over Manchester United. The striker wants his future resolved before he heads off to the European Under 21 Championship and it's claimed he favours a move to Stamford Bridge.",
      "The Athletic have claimed that United and other clubs keen on the forward have been made aware of his preferred move.",
      "Aston Villa have reportedly joined the race to sign Alejandro Garnacho this summer.",

      "AC Milan, Juventus, Inter Milan and Roma are all also interested.",
      "Marcus Rashford is reportedly holding out for a move to Barcelona and is saying no to other moves, according to SPORT in Spain.",
      "The publicatin states that the forward's agent held talks with Barca sporting director Deco in a Spanish hotel on Wednesday morning. It's said that Hansi Flick and the sporting management are 'seduced' by the player's motivation to join them.",
      "However, the Spanish giants are only keen on a loan with an option to buy this summer.",
      "AC Milan are set to open negotiations for Alejandro Garnacho after he was made available for transfer this summer.",
      "Argentine outlet Ole have claimed that Milan have silently begun negotiations for the forward. The report also adds that Napoli, Juventus and Chelsea are all considering offers.",
      "Milan are thought to believe £50million would be enough to sign him.",
      "Man United are looking at bringing in Wolves wing-back Nelson Semedo alongside Matheus Cunha, according to reports.",
      "Football Transfers have claimed that United are keen on the Portugal international. Semedo is set to become a free agent at the end of his contract despite being offered a new deal at Molineux.",
      "After the developments that Chelsea had become favourites to sign Liam Delap, it now seems that the Conference League winners are looking elsewhere.",
      "According to Record in Portugal, the Blues have made an enquiry for Viktor Gyokeres in the last few hours'. If the reports are to be believed, it would seem that Enzo Maresca prefers to bring the Sweden international in.",
      "Man United will reportedly look to replace Andre Onana with Burnley goalkeeper James Trafford.",
      "According to Give Me Sport, United are keen on the former Manchester City shot-stopper. Trafford impressed with Burnley this season with Scott Parker labelling him 'world-class'.",
      "Hugo Ekitike remains a possible addition this summer and Caught Offside have claimed that United are in 'advanced stages' of a formal bid for the Eintracht Frankfurt striker having already held positive discussions with his entourage.",
      "Offers of around €80m-€90m are expected to be entertained by Frankfurt.",
      "Ruben Amorim has refused to speak on Matheus Cunha amid the Brazilian's move to Man United.",

      "After a disappointing 2024/25 campaign, Manchester United will have been hoping their transfer strategy to help move past this was watertight.",
      "One of those suitors was United, who had been hoping to add Delap to Ruben Amorim's ranks as well as Wolves forward Matheus Cunha, with it understood his £62.5m release clause is willing to be met by Old Trafford chiefs.",
      "Delap himself has a £30m release clause and in front of the backdrop of 12 goals scored in the top-flight for the relegated Tractor Boys plus his young age, clubs have been lining up for an English talent with huge potential.",
      "The £92.5m cost in total would then look to have been offset by the planned sales of Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho and Antony, all of whom finished the season out on loan to other clubs.",
      "So with United being dealt a considerable blow in landing one of their top two targets, MEN Sport writers have their say on how United can move past Delap and find another suitable target.",
      "I was off the belief that United should have gone all-out for Viktor Gyokeres long before the summer arrived. He's the best on the market, worked with Amorim before to great effect and guarantees goals.",
      "But, if Cunha and Delap was to be the plan instead, so be it.",
      "Cunha, I certainly rate as he had a great record in Germany in his early career and now is Premier League proven. He offers more than a simple No.9, so losing out on him and landing Delap would by far have been the bigger blow.",
      "United can live without Delap. We've all seen with Rasmus Hojlund and Joshua Zirkzee how it is to rely upon young strikers - buying a third seems counter productive, even if this one may actually go on to do great things.",
      "What Amorim needs is somebody who is ready to provide - that is Cunha. Maybe one of Hojlund or Zirkzee stays on as back-up, or a surprise pick would be to see how Chido Obi steps up too.",
      "Missing out on Delap feels more of a concern because United don't seem to have a Plan B at present than it ought to. Yes, Delap is a promising young talent at a reasonable price but there are still question marks as to whether he can do it consistently at the highest level.",
      "Signing a different striker instead of Delap is not an issue but when United had their heart set on the Englishman, where do they go from here? In my opinion, they should go where their efforts should have been focused originally, Victor Osimhen.",
      "The Nigerian has been one of the best goalscorers in Europe for several seasons and Napoli are having to sell him at the fraction of the price due to his desire to depart. A whopping 36 goals for Galatasaray should be more than enough reason to target the striker.",
      "The only issue I envisage is whether his wage demands will be too high for the Reds. But, if Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho and Antony's wages are expected to leave, there could be room for United to meet his demands.",
      "Missing out on Delap will be a big blow to United. Eventhough he’s only done it for one season, finding a young player who has scored goals in the Premier League for just £30 million doesn’t come along too often.",
      "Who United go for now will probably depend on the sort of budget they have for a striker. For me, I would say Viktor Gyokeres would be the idea signing, but with the club closing in on a £62.5 million move for Matheus Cunha, is there room in the budget to spent a similar fee on Gyokeres.",
      "Then there’s the thing of the competition. Arsenal, who can offer Champions League football, have also been heavily linked with the Swede, it could therefore be a hard sell for United with no European football to offer.",
      "So, could United potentially stick with what they have? It could see Chido Obi given more game time and more chances. If that’s the case, united will be hoping he can step up.",
      "I question whether Delap is what United needed. Yes, he is avalible for a relatively cheap fee but moving from Ipswich to Man United is a significant jump.",
      "We've seen with Rasmus Hojlund that signing a young striker can go wrong when they don't have the experience of already playing for a huge club. Delap is better than Hojlund but is likely to have faced the same problems at Old Trafford and that's the last thing United need next season.",
      "In terms of who they could go for next, Gyokeres and Osimhen are the obvious options, but only if they really want to join. The Reds need to stop looking desperate by signing players who are not keen and offering extortionate wages.",
      "Of the two options, Gyokeres looks the better fit having worked under Amorim before and he does have an outstanding goalscoring pedigree. If the Reds can shift Rashford, Sancho, Antony and a few others they may be able to afford him.",
      "It is difficult to see where United can sign a striker for a comparable fee if they do not land Liam Delap. Due to his £30million relegation release clause, the Ipswich Town centre-forward is an outlier on the market this summer.",
      "Other options expected to be on the move will likely leave their current clubs for at least double that. Matheus Cunha is one of those, while Benjamin Sesko (£93million), Hugo Ekitike (£84million) and Viktor Gyokeres (£67million) are among the other most sought-after attackers this summer.",
      "Victor Osimhen, of those available, now appears the most attainable. After spending this season on loan at Galatasaray, a permanent move away now seems inevitable, regardless of the uncertainty surrounding Antonio Conte's future at Napoli.",
      "The striker has a circa €75million (£63m) release clause, a price similar to the buyout in Cunha's contract. However, the reputed potential to include Rasmus Hojlund in any deal to reduce their outlay to around €40million (£34million) now appears to be the best-case scenario for United."

      "Former Manchester United goalkeeper Lee Grant has admitted that he spent his time at Old Trafford preparing for his coaching career despite being a member of the first-team squad.",
      "United paid approximately £1.5m for Grant in the summer of 2018 as they looked to add another goalkeeper to their team. Despite having an impressive career in the EFL with Derby County, Sheffield Wednesday and Burnley, Grant would make just two appearances for the club in four years, retiring from the game in 2022.",
      "His two appearances came in cup competitions. He made his debut against old club Derby in the League Cup before playing his first, and final, full 90 minutes for United in a 2-1 defeat to Astana in the Europa League.",
      "Since ending his playing career, Grant has been part of the backroom staff at Ipswich Town alongside former United assistant and current manager Kieran McKenna. However, following the club's relegation from the Premier League this season, Grant has decided to take the plunge and take on his first managerial job with League One club Huddersfield Town.",
      "Speaking to Yorkshire Live after being unveiled as the Terriers' new manager, Grant explained what he was doing at United during those four years at the club. \"The work that I’ve been putting in is well into over a decade now, well into the back end of my playing career,\" he explained.",
      "\"Yes I was at Manchester United as a player, in reality that was a player-coach role. I think anybody that looks at my appearances for Manchester United will see that quite quickly.",
      "\"I spent more time in the office studying, understanding, listening, learning and absorbing from really top people, and that leads me to be in this seat today.\" While there are some doubts that an unproven manager will be able to lead Huddersfield back to the Championship next season, Grant insists that there is a precedent already set for success for those who have yet to prove themselves in management.",
      "\"You’ve seen David Wagner come in who hasn’t led a team, you’ve seen Carlos Corberan come in who hasn’t led a team, and we’ve seen success on the back of that,\" Grant concluded. \"If you look at League One over the course of the last three or four years, and you take John Mousinho, Kieran McKenna, Steven Schumacher, Chris Davies, the list goes on, I think you can start to create a picture of ‘this can work, this can work and this can work in the middle’.",
      "\"What I’m really pleased about is that Huddersfield Town and myself have huge alignment on what we think has got a really great chance of working for Huddersfield this year, and that the trust and belief is there for me to be the man to push it forward.\""

      "Everyone connected with Manchester United knows they must sign a striker this summer.",
      "It's why there may be some discontent that the Reds have missed out on what looked to be a relatively simple deal to sign Ipswich Town's Liam Delap. Here is a player with Premier League experience who is available for £30million after the Tractor Boys' relegation to English football's second tier.",
      "But would a young striker like Delap be able to cope with the pressure of leading the line for Ruben Amorim's side? It's a responsibility that has weighed heavily on the shoulders of Rasmus Hojlund since arriving from Atalanta. Moving from Ipswich to Old Trafford would be a huge step up.",
      "Reports that Chelsea are set to sign the 22-year-old may, therefore, work in United's favour. The Blues are also said to be interested in Eintracht Frankfurt striker Hugo Ekitike, which would surely end their interest in any other players in that position.",
      "One of those was reportedly Sporting's Viktor Gyokeres, a No. 9 who has inevitably been linked with a move to Old Trafford since his former head coach, Amorim, arrived at M16 in November.",
      "Another club linked with the Swede, Arsenal, may also be turning their attention elsewhere this summer. Reports have claimed that the Gunners are currently leading the race to sign RB Leipzig forward Benjamin Sesko.",
      "According to German outlet BILD, Leipzig are willing to open negotiations for Sesko at €70m (£59m), but they're aiming to rake in €100m (£84m). If Arsenal pay such a fee, Gyokeres is likely to see another club move on - leaving United as one of the few viable options.",
      "The question will be whether United can afford the €80m (£67m) Sporting reportedly want. Selling the likes of Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho and Antony, among others, should help in that regard.",
      "Another concern, of course, would be convincing Gyokeres to join without any European football on offer. Amorim will know that he still faces a tough task to convince one of Europe's best strikers that Man United in 2025 is the right move, and that is the predicament he faces this summer."

      "Manchester United were hit with a transfer blow on Thursday afternoon when it was revealed Liam Delap is leaning towards joining Chelsea instead this summer.",
      "The England under-21 international's £30million release clause made the 12-goal forward one of the most attractive propositions in the summer transfer window.",
      "Newcastle United and Everton were also said to be among the 22-year-old's suitors but it is Chelsea he has chosen and his move from Ipswich Town is expected to be signed and sealed in the coming days.",
      "It is a blow for United who now must look elsewhere in their search for goals, which were severely lacking in the Premier League from both Rasmus Hojlund (four) and Joshua Zirkzee (three) this season.",
      "Both forwards are still young and both clearly struggled with the weight of expectation of being United's main forward.",
      "It is a problem Liverpool legend Jamie Carragher alluded to when discussing United's interest in Delap, as he warned the Ipswich youngster off making the move to Old Trafford.",
      "\"What happened to [Rasmus] Hojlund, sometimes when you’re going from a team who have been relegated - I know Man United are 16th, but they are one of the biggest teams in the world, with the eyes and ears on them.",
      "\"I think that’s such a big step. I know people might say it’s not in terms of league position, but Man United are a monster.\"",
      "Carragher's right. United are a monster - even if they are coming off the back of their worst ever Premier League campaign.",
      "And that is the issue staring United in the face this summer. How do they convince new recruits to sign for the club without the allure of European football but with the weight of history still firmly around their necks?",
      "It takes a special kind of character to play for United but even then, if there are offers from other clubs without that baggage who can offer European football, it will be hard for anyone to say no to moving elsewhere.",
      "Delap certainly didn't and now United must quickly move to Plan B in pursuit of solving their number one transfer priority - finding a new goalscorer."

The former Spain international signed a one-year contract in Florence with an option for an additional season that they are seemingly keen to exercise.",

      "With just three days to go until the summer transfer window officially opens for business, it is impossible to predict what Manchester United's squad could look like come the start of next season.",
      "United have informed players who are under contract for next season that none of them are immune from being sold, meaning a summer of the unexpected could be in the offering.",
      "However, after head coach Ruben Amorim declared earlier this week that United \"cannot do much\" this summer, there is unlikely to be the number of changes many supporters are hoping for after watching the club experience its worst season in 51 years.",
      "Alejandro Garnacho has been informed he will be able to leave the club if an acceptable offer is received, and fellow attackers Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho and Antony have been identified as priority sales.",
      "With United planning to take a sledgehammer to their current crop of attacking options, replacements will, of course, be required. Wolves star Matheus Cunha and Ipswich Town's Liam Delap have long since been identified as leading targets, and the former is looking increasingly likely to become their first signing of the summer.",
      "United plan to trigger Cunha's £62.5million release clause and are currently in discussions with Wolves over the payment structure.",
      "If United get their man, the Brazilian is expected to slot straight into Amorim's first-choice starting line-up and occupy the left-sided No.10 role. That position has been shared by the likes of Bruno Fernandes, Mason Mount, Kobbie Mainoo, Christian Eriksen, Joshua Zirkzee and Garnacho in the last few months, meaning it needs a permanent resident.",
      "Cunha is a specialist No.10, well-versed in operating in that position for Wolves, who also operate with a wing-back system.",
      "However, his impending arrival could have an impact on some more than others, not least Fernandes. The United captain should have a hands-off warning attached this summer amid his importance to Amorim's team.",
      "The beauty of Fernandes' profile is that he can impact proceedings from just about anywhere on the pitch, meaning he will be, just as he demonstrated earlier this year, be capable of strutting his stuff from the centre of midfield.",
      "He has the capacity to control proceedings, create goals and score them himself from the No.8 position, meaning the prospect of Cunha being added to the squad could see him become a permanent fixture in the engine room.",
      "If United are forced to unleash Fernandes as a No.8, though, they may have to scour the market for a suitable midfield partner. Manuel Ugarte has shown flashes of his capabilities this season, but he has also offered signs that he is not able to match the pace of the Premier League.",
      "As good as he can be defensively, he is not effective enough with the ball. He is too slow in possession and can get caught out, meaning United, if there is money to do so, may have to find an alternative partner for Fernandes to compliment his qualities.",
      "Of course, Mainoo could be retained this summer, but he is not a defensive specialist and deploying him next to Fernandes would leave United vulnerable.",
      "United's midfield is flanked by two wing-backs, with Amorim currently blessed with a number of options. Patrick Dorgu should continue as the left-sided wing-back next term to try and grow into the role and stamp his authority on the Premier League, whereas Amad could be made right wing-back-in-chief on the opposite side if Bryan Mbeumo arrives from Brentford.",
      "The Cameroonian attacker has been heavily linked with a move to Old Trafford this week amid United's aspirations of beefing up their attacking options and he would be an excellent addition. Any hopes of signing him, however, will rest on outgoings and whoever else knocks on Brentford's door in pursuit of his signature.",
      "But in the event of him and Cunha moving to Old Trafford and filling the two No.10 positions, they could be supporting Delap up front. United remain keen on the Ipswich goal-getter, who plundered 12 goals in the Premier League this season, and he is available for £30m via a release clause that has become active following the Tractor Boys' relegation.",
      "Delap, who has interest from elsewhere, is an attainable target and would be signed with a view to spearheading a new-look United attack."

The Argentina international was previously dropped from the XI for the Europa League final defeat to Tottenham, after which Garnacho publicly expressed his frustration at a \"s***\" season.",
      "Justin Cochrane previously helped lead United's academy when Garnacho starred in the under-18s' FA Youth Cup victory in 2022. The then-17-year-old winger crowned that campaign by winning the Jimmy Murphy Young Player of the Year award, identifying himself as a future first-team talent.",
      "Cochrane, now a first-team coach at Brentford, noted the player's exceptional talent but also alluded to a mismatch between his conduct and prowess on the pitch. And while he refrained from being overly critical of the young talent, there were hints of possible issues with his behaviour.",
      "Talking to Goal in March 2022 about his efforts to keep Garnacho's ego in check, Cochrane said: \"I have a good relationship with Garnacho, and he knows that if he crosses the line, I'll come get him!\"",
      "The former QPR and Rotherham defender followed up by saying he and his staff were \"pleased\" with the player. However, the conversation again shifted to prioritising modesty, something that might not have come unless there were existing concerns.",
      "\"My job and the staff's job is to keep players grounded and keep their eyes on the prize,\" Cochrane added. \"Not just the youth prize, but the bigger prize of being in the first team and having a sustained career at a high level, so that's what we're focusing on with Garna.\"",
      "Amorim isn't the first United manager to have issues with Garnacho's behaviour. The Madrid-born star was previously chastised by Erik ten Hag after he 'liked' social media posts criticising his half-time substitution in a 2-2 draw against Bournemouth in April 2024.",
      "Ten Hag later revealed his player had apologised for the incident, suggesting they had put the matter behind them. However, Garnacho was subsequently dropped by the Dutchman in September 2024, shortly before he was sacked, for once again liking posts critical of the coach.",
      "Cochrane's comments from 2022 suggest a recurring pattern of behaviour that most coaches would prefer to avoid. And it seems Amorim has reached his limit, with the player apparently free to leave if an appropriate offer is made.",
      "Napoli have shown significant interest in the player during recent transfer windows. However, this potential move may be at risk due to reports suggesting Antonio Conte is ready to depart the club after just one season, having clinched the Serie A title.",
      "This could leave United in a rush to find a club willing to match their valuation for the player. But there's no confusion, it seems, that Amorim is ready to part ways should any outfit stump up the cash, with United supposedly wanting upwards of £60million."

United have not pretended that the football is the priority on this commercial trip that will rake in £8million and the only positive was that some of their callow academy members were granted minutes.",
      "Garnacho briefly vanished down the tunnel during the first half, possibly to maximise the air conditioning. He was selected for the start of the second half and was cheered when he headed over to the far side. They were louder when Garnacho got the ball. Time will tell if it was the last time in the red of United.",
      "Eleven minutes into the second half, Garnacho was on his haunches, briefly overwhelmed by the humidity. The players had to peel their shirts off as though they had been stuck on.",
      "Andre Onana had his name aired for the first time in United colours. Harry Maguire was booed by casual spectators in Melbourne, Las Vegas and Dublin but here in Kuala Lumpur was cheered louder than ever whenever he received the ball.",
      "This was the first occasion that Maguire had captained United from the start since he was stripped of the captaincy in July 2023, extra validation for a player who had his contract extended earlier in the year.",
      "Fernandes inevitably generated the loudest chant upon his half-time arrival. Even Fernandes’ rabona - when a player wraps one leg around the other and pokes the ball forward - that went out for a goal kick drew widespread ‘ooh’s.",
      "The chanting briefly switched to \"Bruno stay, Bruno stay\". Fernandes could have clarified his future by now and has not done so. United have another press conference in Hong Kong on Thursday evening.",
      "The United fans were not entirely enthusiastic. An errant pass from Toby Collyer elicited jeers, with fans willing United to at least score.",
      "You work up a sweat just by sitting down in this part of the world. Fans were handed out to fans, it was that sweltering. Omar Berrada remained statesman-like, arriving in a club suit when he could have been forgiven for donning casual attire. Jason Wilcox is not in Asia ahead of the defining summer of his administrative career.",
      "When United were last in Asia in Bangkok three years ago, Jurgen Klopp played three different Liverpool outfield XIs against them. By the 20-minute mark at the Bukit Jalil, Shea Lacey, Jaydan Kamason, Dan Armer and Sekou Kone were already limbering up with the fitness coach Paulo Barreira.",
      "The quartet came on ten minutes later during a drinks break. Jack Moorhouse's maiden first-team exposure lasted 30 minutes. Casemiro, whose 19-month exile from the Brazil national squad ended with Carlos Ancelotti's appointment, gratefully traipsed off.",
      "Amorim was more drastic than Klopp. There were 11 changes at half-time, so Lacey, Kone, Armer and Kamason were not even afforded a quarter of the match. All but one of the second-half XI played 45 minutes.",
      "United used 27 players, overall. Altay Bayindir was the only unused matchday squad member, with Matthijs de Ligt, Joshua Zirkzee, Luke Shaw and Mason Mount all clad in leisure gear. United have another game in less than 48 hours, a four-hour flight away, in Hong Kong.",
      "They sang ‘Glory glory Man United’ in the stands. In a season that could not end soon enough for United, it goes on, on, on."

He’s already had one crack at replacing a Big Six legend whose fingerprints are all over the club. At least with United he’s a good few steps removed from all that. But swapping what he’s got going at Villa for United would still be a questionable move.",

      "Ipswich fans have had to do a lot of ‘resigning themselves’.",
      "Resigning themselves to the fact the Premier League was going to be incredibly tough. Resigning themselves to losing most games. Resigning themselves to being patronisingly told to stop playing in a naive possession-based style despite not in fact playing that. Resigning themselves to being last on Match of the Day. Resigning themselves to relegation.",
      "But now, Ipswich fans are resigning themselves to something else: the prospect of losing their best player this summer.",
      "The revelation that Liam Delap has a £30m release clause should the club go down was like the doors being swung open on a Black Friday stampede. Teams from across the Premier League were jostling to be first to the checkout, with Chelsea seemingly winning the race to sign a striker who is perhaps worth double that.",
      "Ipswich fans have no ill will to the notion of Delap moving. Selling your best players to bigger clubs is the fate of being a non-elite side and £30million is no small amount for a club like ours – far more than the £3million we got for Aaron Cresswell, who has gone on to make over 300 appearances in the Premier League. (yes it still annoys me.)",
      "Your only hope is that these players stay long enough to give you some good memories. In Liam Delap, that has very much been the case.",
      "I will be the first to admit I had my doubts when we signed him. He cost £15m, making him the second-most-expensive signing in Town’s history and while our most expensive signing – Omari Hutchinson – had at least spent a year on loan with us, Delap was more of an unknown.",
      "For a start, he could have been seen as a Man City cast-off and even if he had a promising season at Hull in 2023/24, the fact City were willing to let him go suggested they did not fully believe in his potential.",
      "But in Kieran McKenna we trust and it took just three games before Town fans had a new hero, his goal against Fulham securing the club’s first point in the Premier League for 22 years.",
      "Analysing a player in 2025 can be done in two ways – the hard data of stats or, for lack of a better term, vibes.",
      "If we start off with the more easily quantifiable stats, Delap is ticking every box. Top goalscorer at the club by a mile; 12 goals from an xG of 9.02; 2.31 shots a game, 1.4 successful dribbles, 3.68 touches in the opposition box and 1.75 fouls won, all for an Ipswich side that has not had time for much attacking this season.",
      "Internationally, he won the Under-19 Euros with England, has played in every age group up to the U-21 level, and recently trained with the senior side – pictured alongside Harry Kane who some predict he will one day replace.",
      "But boiling Delap down to stats misses why he has become such a fan favourite at the club. xG and xA are grand but you would have to create a metric of ‘xTimes run into an opponent, flinging them to the ground and somehow getting away with it much to the fans’ delight’ to truly capture the essence of Delap.",
      "In many ways, he is a traditional number nine. Kick the ball up long and he will become a whirlwind of elbows and arms as he tries to hold off the often much bigger defenders. Ipswich’s first game of the season saw Liverpool visit Portman Road and Town fans soon saw what Delap was about when he sent Virgil van Dijk – and himself – tumbling to the ground.",
      "Playing Ipswich has not been the hardest prospect for anybody this season, but centre-backs will have come away glad that the annoying buzzing bee of Delap is gone.",
      "He can trap the ball, a vital skill for a team under pressure, and on the rare occasion Ipswich wingers were not pegged back, he is able to play smart one-twos and create shots at goal.",
      "He also has the technique to be an adept finisher. His goal away at Aston Villa highlights perhaps the very best of Delap, muscling past two defenders before getting the slightest of touches to steer the ball into the net.",
      "But while number 9s of yesteryear were perhaps a bit slow, a bit too stationary and more focused on putting the ball in the net rather than getting it into a position to do so – Delap is very much the opposite.",
      "His 1.85m build is almost all legs, followed by a fridge-freezer of a chest, which he will more than happily slam into defenders. He is happy to pick the ball up and just run at defenders, a trait that has been passed out of the game of late. Only three players at Ipswich complete more dribbles per 90 than Delap; only two of those have a higher success rate.",
      "He scores tap-ins, he scores penalties, he scores goals from the edge of the area, he scores goals having dribbled his way through a defence. Aside from a 40-yard-volley or a bicycle kick, Delap has treated Ipswich fans to almost every kind of goal there is. Considering chances are few and far between, this ability to turn even the sniff of an opportunity into a goal has been crucial for Town. In Ipswich’s four wins this season, he has scored in three of them.",
      "Delap is also just about on the right side of being slightly unhinged. No forward in the league has been booked more than him this season and those yellows have almost always been fouls committed by steamrolling a just little too hard into an opponent.",
      "But in the same way that if you took away Wayne Rooney’s aggression the player would suffer, telling Delap to calm down may well take away what makes him so good and so endearing to his own club’s supporters. Like a Luis Suarez minus the biting.",
      "Of the top strikers in the league, it is perhaps only Erling Haaland that plays in the same way and while the Norwegian is a more lethal finisher, Delap certainly has the advantage when it comes to pace. Other strikers meanwhile prefer to create as much as they score, passing the ball to the side rather than running at defences.",
      "MORE ON LIAM DELAP ON F365\n👉 Man Utd, Chelsea target labelled an ‘absolute snip’ at £30m: ‘He will 100% move on’\n👉 Man Utd transfers: Ratcliffe ‘intends to trigger’ £92m double swoop ‘as quickly as possible’ in summer\n👉 Man Utd ‘expected to win the race’ for second signing after closing in on Cunha deal",
      "Even before he moved to Ipswich, he was singled out for praise with Hull boss Liam Rosenior calling him “a special, special talent”. Since moving to Suffolk, his stock has only risen. McKenna, who is not known for his overly emotive language, said not only has he “evolved his game” but he was “incredibly receptive and very football smart”.",

      "United legend Neville feels it may be a good thing that the club didn’t pick up European silverware, as that might have masked the problems at Old Trafford.",
      "He told GOAL: “I was in a pub watching it. I didn’t react at the end of the game. It sort of, to be fair, was something that felt quite expected. The club has made a lot of poor decisions over the last 10 years, and I think Wednesday night, it all came home to roost on and off the pitch.",

      "“But the reality of it is, it’s too much for them, and it’s too much for everybody at the club at this moment in time. And there’s no doubt that there is going to need to be changes there.",
      "“There’s obviously a manager who’s relatively new who’s going to need to do quite a lot of work in changing and adapting that squad to get what he wants. And he’s collected a group of players who have had a difficult time before he came, even more difficult time since he arrived.",
      "“It would have been a silver lining around the dark cloud last Wednesday night if Manchester United would have won. But the fact that they didn’t win, maybe it’s what the club needed.",
      "“When you win a final and you get into the Champions League, you can sometimes tell yourself, ‘yeah, we’re ok’. We’re not ok. The club’s not ok. It needs drastic change, and I’m hopeful of that drastic change coming. How far that will set Manchester United back, that loss, we don’t know yet.",
      "“But fans are patient. They love the club. They love the players. They love their manager. And they recognise that one day, Manchester United will return to success, but it could be quite a while off yet because of what’s happening in the current phase.”",

      "It’s thought the England U21 international was picking between United and Chelsea and was ‘leaning towards’ the Red Devils, according to talkSPORT, but the Blues are now ‘confident he will sign’ for them.",
      "The report claims ‘Chelsea have the trump card of being able to offer Champions League football’ after a 1-0 victory over Nottingham Forest on the final day of the Premier League campaign resulted in a fourth-placed finish.",
      "The new of Delap’s decision in favour of Chelsea came as Enzo Maresca’s side beat Real Betis 4-1 in the Europa Conference League final to end the season with a trophy.",
      "The Blues went behind early on as Abde Ezzalzouli capitalised on a Malo Gusto mistake, but Chelsea were inspired after half-time, with Cole Palmer providing two sublime assists for Enzo Fernandez and Nicolas Jackson, before Jadon Sancho and Moises Caicedo wrapped up the victory.",
      "“I’ll actually be stunned if he isn’t at Chelsea,” Cole said.",
      "“He kind of reminds me of a young Alan Shearer when he was at Southampton,” added Steve Sidwell.",

      "“Hopefully, it can be a starting point [toward further success in the future], he said. “To build a winning mentality, you need to win games and competitions. For sure, the trophy we won tonight will make us better.",
      "“But also, I’m very proud of the path, the journey, we have done in the Premier League. That is the most difficult competition in the world, you need to be consistent over 38 games, and these players showed that.",
      "“It’s why, after Nottingham Forest, my outburst was exaggerated. But over 38 games, you have to be consistent and with the youngest squad in the history of the Premier League, it is something unbelievable.”",
      "Delap’s imminent move to Chelsea wasn’t the only blow struck to United’s transfer plans on Wednesday, as the Telegraph claimed Newcastle have ‘everything in place’ to complete the signing of Brentford star Bryan Mbeumo, whom United have ‘held talks’ with over a move to Old Trafford.",

      "Manchester United have been treading on rakes in the transfer market for a decade now; selling Bruno Fernandes would be the most catastrophic mis-step yet.",
      "Apparently, the clock is ticking on Al-Hilal’s offer to make Fernandes their marquee player ahead of the Club World Cup. That in isolation is not an offer that you would expect to tempt the United captain. But £700,000 a week is a sweetener few could simply dismiss without serious consideration.",
      "If Fernandes is turned on by the prospect of selling his wares in Saudi, then United could expect to receive an offer of around £100million for their skipper. The response should be a firm and final ‘no’.",
      "No doubt the prospect of immediately filling the black hole in the books dug in Bilbao will appeal to the bean counters at Old Trafford. But at some point amid the scrimping and saving, they have to remember they are a football club. And without Fernandes they might have been a football club playing Championship football next season.",
      "The skipper’s influence cannot be overstated. Not only does he make this iteration of United something close to watchable, but he was involved in 40% of their goals last season, continuing his frankly ludicrous consistency with 19 goals and 20 assists in a team that for large swathes of the season had forgotten how to score.",
      "How would United replace Fernandes’ productivity if they took the Saudi cash? Lord knows the answer doesn’t lie within. They would have to spend the same again to gamble on getting anything like the same output from a new recruit, completely defeating the purpose of the sale. And would you back anyone at Old Trafford to pick a winner these days, let alone one to produce on Fernandes’ scale?",
      "There can be no ignoring United’s need for cash this summer. These days, stories of cutbacks rival transfer gossip for sheer volume. INEOS and the Glazers have shown that anyone is fair game, but assuming they wish one day to be taken seriously again as a football club, a line has to be drawn somewhere in the dressing-room, even if only around the pegs of Fernandes’ and Amad Diallo.",
      "You could make a reasonable argument for selling any other player. If Ruben Amorim really thinks so little of Kobbie Mainoo, or United were offered a profit on Leny Yoro, you might pick through the logic while saying goodbye through gritted teeth.",
      "So with almost a squad’s worth of players to take to market, United for the first time in over a decade need to sell smartly. And there’s nothing remotely clever about selling your best player and severely weakening Amorim’s ranks in one misguided motion.",
      "Amorim stated his case when he was asked about selling his captain earlier this month…",
      "“No, it’s not going to happen. He’s not going anywhere because I’ve already told him! I want Bruno here because we want to win the Premier League again, so we want the best players to continue with us. He’s 30, but he’s still so young, because he plays 55 games every season. Between assists and goals, he’s there for 30 at least, so he’s the type of player we want here and he’s not going anywhere.”",
      "The beleaguered boss is already having a hard time asserting his authority while hiding his disdain for the group at his disposal. If United vetoed Amorim over Fernandes, the manager might as well follow the captain through the exit door.",
      "During his seven months in charge, Amorim has repeatedly backed Fernandes in the face of criticism from outside Old Trafford, most strikingly when it came again from one of the current captain’s predecessors. Roy Keane is among the many who take issue with Fernandes and his flailing arms. But if Keane was leading this mob, blood would spatter the dressing room walls. Actually, Keane would most likely have walked away long ago in fury at his team-mates’ inability to match his standards. And few would blame Fernandes for doing the same. He really is better than this.",
      "MORE MAN UTD OPINION FROM F365\n👉 Man Utd and Spurs insulated from failure; Premier League needs its jeopardy back\n👉 Rock-bottom for Amorim and Man Utd? No, it really could get worse…",
      "If he is to leave United, it certainly should not be for Saudi. Fernandes, aged 30, remains at his peak and merits a stage like Real Madrid, Barcelona, Bayern Munich – or a post-banter era United should they ever emerge from it – before easing into retirement in an exhibition league if that path appeals.",
      "But, for now, it seems like Fernandes is keen to stay and be part of the rebuild. Selling him would be the clearest signal yet from United that they are no longer a serious football club.",
      "According to reports, there has been an ‘intriguing twist’ in the race to sign Manchester United captain Bruno Fernandes, with Al-Hilal ‘ready to pay’.",
      "Man Utd captain Bruno Fernandes has been given a deadline by Saudi Arabian side Al-Hilal after making him a ‘final contract offer’, according to reports.",
      "Man Utd have been told that they should “push” Bruno Fernandes “out” of the club if they receive a £100m “offer” from Saudi Arabia.",
      "Jamie Redknapp has picked out a “game-changer” in Manchester United’s squad for INEOS to sell this summer amid interest from elsewhere.",
      "The Man Utd players have pleaded with Bruno Fernandes to remain at Old Trafford amid interest from Saudi Arabia, according to reports.",
      "Man Utd captain Bruno Fernandes is reportedly ‘open’ to joining Al-Hilal this summer after the Red Devils’ loss in the Europa League final."

      "United ‘would also be delighted to exchange Fermin Lopez’, who’s also valued at around the €50m mark, though Hansi Flick is said to be loathe to lose the 22-year-old, who has been in and out of the team for much of the season, but finished the campaign in fine form, with three goals and an assist from midfield in the last four La Liga games.",

      "“When he came on the scene, I was really surprised by his maturity and the way he played. He is such a talented player but level-headed and down-to-earth. That’s what you want as a Manchester United player. I really hope they don’t let this one slip.",
      "“They’ve let McTominay go, which I thought was absolutely crazy because he can play in several positions, he’s a die-hard United fan and came through the academy ranks to get to the first team.",

      "“They’re both so young and they’ve come in at a difficult time. Normally young strikers would have a more experienced striker to learn from and bounce off them.",
      "“If United had bought Harry Kane two summers ago I think Hojlund or Zirkzee would be different players learning from him. I don’t mean to take anything away from Delap but I don’t think he’s an upgrade.",

      "Bruno Fernandes, Alejandro Garnacho, Jonny Evans and Amad Diallo were among 11 changes at half-time with the score locked at 0-0, but Maung Maung Lwin netted a 71st-minute winner for the South-East Asia XI to inflict another defeat on Amorim's struggling side.",
      "United were booed in parts for their lacklustre display by those in attendance and, reacting to his side's reception in the Malaysian capital, Amorim said: \"I'm always guilty of the performance of the team, no matter what. Since I've been here from the first day, I am guilty. The boos from the fans is something that we need, maybe. Because every game we lost in the Premier League, they [fans] were always there [supporting].",

      "Manchester United will invest in new players this summer, but without Champions League football next season, the club does not need a big squad, says Ruben Amorim.",
      "United recorded their worst-ever Premier League campaign after finishing 15th in the table, losing 18 games in the process, and defeat to Tottenham Hotspur in the Europa League final means no European football next season.",
      "As a result of having fewer matches to play next season, Amorim - who is hoping to bring Wolves forward Matheus Cunha to the club - wants to operate with a smaller squad that will be easier to manage next season.",
      "\"We always prepare two plans,\" said the Portuguese at the start of the club's preseason tour of Malaysia and Hong Kong. \"With and without the Champions League. Without the Champions League, we also don't need a big squad.",
      "\"We can control the squad in a better way. Then we have a plan, that is to bring in some new players, but our big plan is to improve the team we have, to improve the Academy.",
      "\"It was the past, so it can be the future. It can't change much because of Financial Fair Play, we are not allowed to do much, even with the Champions League, so we are prepared.\"",

      "\"It was important to finish the season, we needed to close that chapter,\" he said. \"It's not fully behind us because I have one row of English journalists waiting for the hard questions, so I will rest from that when we finish the tour.",
      "\"To tell you the truth, I closed that chapter, I'm excited, I'm nervous, I want to work to the next season, I don't have that feeling that I need to disconnect, I had the feeling to close the season, but now it's a new season, so I am excited at the same moment.",

      "Wednesday 28 May 2025 12:31, UK",
      "The transfer window is opening earlier than usual this summer ahead of FIFA's newly expanded Club World Cup - but what can we expect?",

      "Premier League clubs Chelsea and Manchester City are competing with the likes of Real Madrid, Bayern Munich, Paris Saint-Germain and Inter Milan.",

There is no third-place play-off between the two losing semi-final teams.\n\n\nThe tournament runs from June 15, with the final taking place on July 13.",
      "Cristiano Ronaldo attracts attention like few others on the planet - so it was no surprise to see FIFA president Gianni Infantino reveal discussions had taken place for him to sign for a Club World Cup team. His great rival, Lionel Messi, will be there with Inter Miami.",

      "Tuesday 27 May 2025 15:53, UK",
      "Antony has revealed he considered retiring during his lowest moment at Manchester United but says he is \"smiling and happy\" at Real Betis.",
      "The 25-year-old Brazilian winger, who signed for United from Ajax for £85m in September 2022, joined the LaLiga side on loan in January after struggling at Old Trafford.",
      "Antony scored just 12 times in 96 appearances for Manchester United, playing only 14 times this season under Erik ten Hag and then Ruben Amorim.",
      "Antony was the subject of allegations of domestic abuse by three women in September 2023, though he was not arrested or charged in either Brazil or the UK and denies the allegations.",
      "The case in Brazil closed in August 2024 but the Greater Manchester Police investigation into alleged incidents said to have occurred in the UK remains open.",
      "Ten Hag said in January last year that Antony's \"off-field issues\" had impacted his form, and on the eve of Betis' Conference League final against Chelsea, the winger teared up when speaking about the effect it had on him.",
      "\"I went through some very difficult times there that ended up affecting me a lot. But I am very grateful even for these difficult moments that I went through. Today, I feel much more mature, much more prepared, I feel much better.",
      "\"It was a moment when I thought about stopping playing. I no longer felt that desire to play football because of everything I was going through, because of all the accusations and because I had remained silent for so long.",
      "\"[My career] has changed a lot [at Betis]. It changed a lot because I needed to find myself, for everything I went through there in my personal life. I wanted to do things, but it seemed like it wasn't happening because I wasn't happy, I wasn't feeling that desire to play football anymore, and I needed to find myself.",
      "\"Playing football was always something that I loved and I went through difficult times when I didn't feel that pleasure anymore.",
      "\"I would always talk to my brother, I used to say, 'I can't do it anymore, I can't do it anymore'. He said: 'Hold on a little longer and things will change'.",

      "\"It was very complicated but with the help of my family with the help of God, I managed to turn things around. I'm already very happy here.\"",
      "Antony has scored nine goals and produced five assists in 25 appearances for Betis, becoming one of the standout players in Spain during the second half of the season.",
      "They have lost just four times since he arrived, helping them to finish sixth in LaLiga and reach the Conference League final as they bid for their first-ever European trophy.",
      "Antony praised head coach Manuel Pellegrini for helping him rediscover his form in his usual position on the right wing.",
      "\"From the first conversation I had with him, he gave me incredible confidence, he made me feel very comfortable,\" said Antony.",
      "\"And when I got here, the conversation we had was very positive. He told me: 'I know your potential, you didn't join the national team for nothing, you didn't play in a World Cup for nothing, you know what a player you are, you've been through difficult times and you have your responsibilities, you have your part of the blame too'. But he made me feel very comfortable.",
      "\"He always gave me a lot of confidence and he always told me: 'I don't want you to make 20 plays, I want you to make five, six with the aim of scoring, an assist, that will already help me a lot.",
      "\"I took all that advice and Pellegrini is a coach that I'm very grateful to.\"",
      "Antony joined Betis on a straight loan deal with his Manchester United contract running until 2027, with a club-held option of a further year.",
      "Antony admitted he has some regrets about his time at Manchester United and said he doesn't know what the future will hold.",
      "\"I have the feeling that I could have done more with the United jersey but I'm also very grateful for everyone's affection that I had there,\" he said. \"I even have a lot of contact there.",
      "\"It was a difficult moment that I went through, and today I'm smiling here and I'm happy.",
      "\"I always say that I'm doing my part. I'm playing football, I'm happy and I'm doing well. I don't know about the future.",
      "\"I'll keep doing my part so that when the transfer window opens, my agents are working on it. But now my focus is on doing well and we'll see what happens in the future.\"",

      "The increasing emphasis on direct play can be seen up and down the Premier League and it is reflected in the numbers. Fast breaks are happening more often than ever before.",
      "At 2.04, the average number of fast breaks per game is more than three times higher than it was in 2017/18 as teams increasingly favour speed and directness.",
      "Mohamed Salah left it late but his 84th-minute equaliser against Crystal Palace on the final day took him to a record-equalling 47 Premier League goal involvements.",
      "He is one of only three players to hit that total in the history of the competition and it is important to note that the others, Alan Shearer and Andrew Cole, did so in 42-game seasons.",
      "Salah was the Premier League's outstanding player and his importance to Liverpool's title triumph shines through in the number of points his goals and assists won the side.",
      "Injuries have been a common theme this season, with players missing over 25,000 days due to setbacks. That is the equivalent of 70 years.",
      "Hamstring problems accounted for more than 21 per cent of all the days lost from injuries in the Premier League, with knee injuries a long way behind as the second-most impactful category.",
      "Arsenal lost all of Bukayo Saka, Kai Havertz and Gabriel to long-term hamstring problems. Havertz took three months to recover, Saka needed four - and Gabriel is still out.",
      "Marcus Rashford's hamstring injury ruled him out of Aston Villa's run-in, while Chelsea's Nicolas Jackson missed a large chunk of the season too.",
      "Why are they so common? Well, workload could be one reason.",
      "For some sides, there are more matches than ever before due to extended European campaigns coming after Euro 2024. How Manchester City and Chelsea manage the Club World Cup this summer will come under the microscope too.",
      "But the intensity of the Premier League is also going up. After a few years of a steady climb, it has increased at a much sharper pace.",
      "England's top flight is more watchable than ever in that regard but can its own players - and specifically their hamstrings - cope?",
      "Rory Delap's legacy lives on - and no, we're not talking about the goalscoring exploits of his son Liam at Ipswich.",
      "This season has seen the long throw come back into fashion. Four seasons ago, chucking the ball into the box was a rarity, with long throws coming at an average of around three a week. Now we are averaging around 10 every matchday in the Premier League as more and more teams add to their set-piece arsenals.",
      "English sides have even taken their long-throw exploits into other competitions. Arsenal's Thomas Partey had 11 long throws in the Champions League semi-final second leg against Paris Saint-Germain, while Crystal Palace caused Manchester City all sorts of problems via Chris Richards' throws in the FA Cup final, seeing one goal disallowed from this method.",
      "Brentford have led the way on set-pieces this season, scoring six out of the eight goals scored from long throws in the Premier League. Bournemouth and Leicester also struck from them in the back end of the season.",
      "Remember, Thomas Frank's side have also added goals from kick-offs to their methods of scoring. Set-pieces are not just corners and free-kicks, you know…",
      "Going into the final round of games, Premier League teams had lined up in a 4-2-3-1 on 408 occasions - 112 more than in the previous season.",
      "On average, this setup featured in 54 per cent of starting formations, marking the highest usage rate for any system since 4-4-2 registered 54 per cent in 2008/09, before plummeting to just 12 per cent by 2013.",
      "No other system came close to 4-2-3-1 this season. The 4-3-3 was used 114 times, plummeting from 172 last year, while Ruben Amorim's 3-4-2-1 appeared 117 times - overtaking 4-3-3 to become the second-most popular formation.",
      "Many fancied Manchester City to retain their crown and win a fifth consecutive Premier League title at the start of the season but their challenge collapsed during a period of unprecedented turbulence between November and December, when they won one game in nine.",
      "Pep Guardiola's side went from having a statistically-calculated 95 per cent chance of winning the title in September to having a one per cent chance only three months later.",
      "Rodri's ACL injury, suffered against Arsenal in September, was undoubtedly a key factor in the collapse but a broader rebuild has already begun. City recovered to clinch a Champions League spot but major improvement will be needed to get back to their previous level next term.",
      "Of the 10 games played on the final day of the season, only two ended as home wins. Home comforts just are not what they used to be.",
      "Home advantage continued to decline this season, with only 40.8 per cent of games won by the home team, compared to 34.7 per cent won by the away team.",
      "With the exception of the period when games were played behind closed doors during lockdown, the percentage of home wins in England's top tier was lower this season than in any previous campaign dating back to 1888, continuing an intriguing trend.",
      "Is this the season the 'Big Six' concept died?",
      "Their cumulative total of 378 points was their lowest since the clubs all finished in the top six for the first time in Premier League history in 2010/11.",
      "Liverpool, Arsenal, Manchester City and Chelsea comprised the Premier League's top four, but the two others, Manchester United and Tottenham, finished 15th and 17th, respectively.",
      "The same data still has Manchester United and Spurs in the bottom half, at 11th and 14th.",
      "It might be time to reassess the so-called 'Big Six'.",
      "Of course, it is not just about the Premier League itself. This season also saw several teams end long trophy waits.",
      "Newcastle celebrated their first major trophy in 70 years by beating Liverpool to win the Carabao Cup.",
      "Crystal Palace won the first piece of silverware in the club's 119-year existence by beating Manchester City to lift the FA Cup.",
      "Then there was Tottenham, ending a 17-year wait as they put their domestic struggles to one side to claim Europa League glory by beating Manchester United in the final.",
      "For the second consecutive season, all three promoted sides went straight back down.",
      "For Sheffield United, Burnley and Luton, read Southampton, Ipswich and Leicester.",
      "It is a phenomenon that had only occurred once before in Premier League history, back in 1997/98, and it underlines the widening gap between the Premier League and the Championship.",
      "Southampton, Ipswich and Leicester recorded the lowest combined points total by the three relegated teams of any season in Premier League history",
      "The graphic below shows how net spend typically correlates with survival but this season proves it might not save you.",
      "Southampton, Ipswich and Leicester had a far higher average net spend than Sheffield United, Burnley and Luton last season but it still was not enough to keep them in the division.",
      "Good luck, then, Leeds, Burnley and Sunderland. Recent evidence suggests you might need it."
