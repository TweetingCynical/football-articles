      "Rio Ferdinand feels Harry Maguire has practically 'risen from the dead' under Ruben Amorim. The seasoned centre-half joined Manchester United back in 2019, but his Old Trafford tenure has been far from plain sailing.",
      "Maguire played a big part in the club's eighth-place finish under Erik ten Hag in the 2023/24 campaign. As a result, the 32-year-old received a wealth of criticism for his performances on the pitch by fans, pundits and club legends alike. Maguire was phased out under Ten Hag as United kicked off last season, deemed surplus to requirements by the Dutchman.",
      "But when Amorim arrived as his successor in November, the Sheffield-born player was able to fight his way back into the team and show some incredible individual performances – despite United ultimately finishing in 15th in the Premier League.",
      "As a result, Maguire now appears to be a part of Amorim's plans for the new season. While he is out of contract next summer, and with a wealth of interest coming from three Premier League clubs – as well as two teams in Italy – it seems increasingly likely that Maguire will stay put. All five transfer approaches were knocked back by United, as per The Daily Mail.",
      "Maguire is said to be keen on signing another extension, which would see him retire at Old Trafford. While the club are said to be on the same page, no formal talks have begun as of yet.",
      "Speaking about Maguire's career resurgence on his Rio Presents podcast alongside Joel Beya, Ferdinand was quick to praise the character and resilience he had shown in hard times.",
      "The former Manchester United and England star said: \"I ain't got that bad energy energy for players or for the club, I want them to do well. But if they don't play well, I'm gonna say what I see, and I had that discussion with Harry Maguire.\"",
      "Ferdinand added: \"We had the tough questions like that, what's it like you having criticism? And someone who risen from the dead almost, shown character. He was down and out, but he's come back. So to show that character and resilience, it was nice to just get beneath the skin and talk with him about it.\"",
      "Maguire's decision to remain at Old Trafford last summer despite Ten Hag's decision has seemingly paid dividends, with Amorim since finding a role in the squad for the former club captain and rewarding him with a one-year contract extension in January.",
      "On top of that, Amorim has also included Maguire in a six-man leadership group alongside Bruno Fernandes, Diogo Dalot, Tom Heaton, Lisandro Martinez and Noussair Mazraoui, as he looks to utilise the passing down of experience of senior players to younger members of the squad.",
      "Speaking about the cohort, Amorim said: \"We have a leadership group now. It's not just Bruno. It's not just Harry. It's six guys. They are responsible for the group. There are some things that in the last year I had to deal with and I said to them this season, you deal with that.",
      "\"Small issues are with you guys. You're responsible. All these small changes, but I think it's helping the group. We have Bruno, we have Harry, Licha [Martinez], Diogo, Tom and Nous.\"",
      "Maguire has also excelled during United's pre-season tour of America, starting in the side's 4-1 win over Bournemouth in the Premier League Summer Series.",
      "It will be interesting to see if he starts when United face Fiorentina at Old Trafford come Saturday. Their Premier League opener follows on Sunday, August 17 against Arsenal, where Maguire could face former Red Devils target Viktor Gyokeres, who Amorim knows all about from their time together at Sporting CP.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Paul Pogba has launched a luxury jewellery business with wife Zulay as he looks to get his life back on track following his doping scandal. The French midfielder recently signed a two-year deal with AS Monaco, restarting his footballing journey after receiving a ban for failing a drug test.",
      "Now, Pogba is eager to put his recent troubles behind him as he launches 'Unbreakable', a luxury collection in collaboration with his wife and jewellery house Elke Berr. Speaking to Var-Matin, Zulay described the struggles her husband has been through as something that created an extremely strong bond between them.",
      "She said: \"Paul’s problems were public. It affected us as a couple. It affected our children. We have been through very tough times, but we have stayed united. This is what we wanted to communicate through the collection: you are not alone in facing difficulties, what matters is getting back up.\"",
      "Pogba was once revered as one of the brightest talents in Europe. He found success at Juventus before returning to Manchester United, winning multiple trophies at the highest level. However, in 2023, the midfielder was initially suspended from playing after failing a drug test, with DHEA found in his system while in his second stint in Turin.",
      "More failed results followed, and the Italian side mutually agreed to terminate his contract after Pogba was banned from playing for four years by the Italian Anti-Doping National Tribunal. This ban was later reduced to 18 months, and he was allowed back into the competitive foray by March of this year.",
      "It wasn't just the stress of Pogba's drug ban that brought the couple closer together, though. The French international saw his brother, Mathias, sentenced to three years in prison in 2024 - with two years suspended - for attempted extortion of the ex-United star.",
      "The former footballer had been accused, alongside five other men, of attempting to extort €13million (£10.7m) from Pogba, and was found guilty last year - despite protesting his innocence throughout.",
      "Now, the current Monaco midfielder is trying to put his past behind him and focus on the future with his wife and children, with the jewellery business a joint venture between the two. Discussing their struggles, Zulay said: \"Unbreakable isn’t just about Paul and me.",
      "\"It’s a shared story – that of a child with their mother or father, sisters, brothers, two best friends. These bonds help us not to be defeated by life’s roller coaster. For us, Unbreakable is more than just a jewellery collection. It’s a symbol.\"",
      "The collection offers many different styles of jewellery, from necklaces to rings and bracelets, and is available on the Elke Berr Joaillerie website. Pogba and his partner plan to open a showroom in Monaco next September in collaboration with Monte-Carlo Diamonds.",
      "The Bolivian model added: \"What we went through was seen by many because it was public. But getting back up isn’t just about returning to sport, it’s about returning to life.\"",
      "As Ligue 1 returns in a week, Pogba will hope his life will remain positive. For now, fans will assume a spot in France's 2026 World Cup squad is a potential pipe dream - but the 32-year-old will be back on the pitch soon enough.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Manchester United target Carlos Baleba highlighted his elite mentality when dismissing transfer rumours last year. The Brighton star has attracted interest from a number of top clubs, but rather than getting caught up in all the noise, Baleba has insisted he just wants to get his head down and work hard.",
      "United have splurged well over £100million on attacking talent this summer and are nearing a deal for another forward - Benjamin Sesko - for a fee of around £74m.",
      "But they are yet to secure a central midfielder, arguably one of the areas they most need to bolster, especially considering Ruben Amorim's doubts about Kobbie Mainoo and Manuel Ugarte, as well as the fact that Casemiro is not getting any younger.",
      "That could soon change, though, as reports emerged on Wednesday evening claiming United intermediaries had reached out to Brighton to discuss a potential deal for 21-year-old Cameroonian.",
      "Baleba matches the profile of the midfielder Ineos have been targeting for United, considering his age, skillset, and top-flight experience. Rio Ferdinand told United chiefs to prioritise a move for him over Sesko last month, labelling him as a midfielder who can 'do it all'.",
      "The 21-year-old has also shown valuable traits, including a strong work ethic and humility during his short time at Brighton. He demonstrated his character last year when quizzed about being linked with a transfer amid rumoured interest from clubs like Liverpool.",
      "When asked about talk of a potential move to other Premier League sides, Baleba emphasised he was not focused on other clubs. Instead, he stated he was eager to keep progressing and even hinted he may not be ready to be a star player at a top club.",
      "\"If I can help a team-mate, I will. If they can help me, I’ll accept that help to push forward and develop. So, I just work to help my team and for myself, to progress for the future.",
      "\"In return, everyone who helps me wants me to go to the highest level. And if there are big clubs who want me, it’s not something that worries me or gets me excited. I just need to work hard and keep a cool head.",
      "\"I don’t know if I’m going to be the star or the next big thing. For me, being the star is quite a lot. Everyone talking about you, singing your name? That just doesn’t do it for me.",
      "\"It’s not something that gets me running. I just prefer getting my head down and working on the pitch.\"",
      "The Red Devils appeared to receive a boost in their plans to sign Baleba when journalist Fabrizio Romano reported that agreeing personal terms is unlikely to be a stumbling block with the player, who still has three years remaining on his current contract at the AMEX Stadium.",
      "However, Brighton chief Paul Barber has since denied claims of United making an approach for the player, labelling the transfer links as mere \"speculation\". The Athletic also reported that Brighton have no plans to sanction a sale this summer and wish to retain Baleba for another year.",
      "That could be a significant setback to Ruben Amorim's hopes of signing him, given Brighton's reputation for being tough negotiators. At this point, it also seems unlikely that United will be in the financial position to offer the sort of money that would be required to tempt Brighton into parting with their star player.",
      "The Cameroon international joined Brighton in 2023 following the departures of Alexis Mac Allister and Moises Caicedo. Since his arrival, he has developed into one of the Premier League's most impressive central midfielders, featuring in 77 matches for the Seagulls across all competitions.",

      "A host of Premier League clubs, including the Gunners, United and Liverpool, have spent the summer looking for a new No 9. Arsenal have since signed Gyokeres with United now closing in on a deal for Sesko. Liverpool themselves are keen on snapping up Alexander Isak.",
      "Nunez was tipped to exit Anfield heading into the summer after scoring just five times in the top-flight last season.",
      "And while he has tentatively been linked with other clubs in England in recent months, the Uruguay star is poised to move to the Saudi Pro League with Al-Hilal.",
      "But as Nunez prepares to undergo a medical before completing his £46million move, Saunders has questioned why Liverpool's domestic rivals decided against pursuing a move for the striker.",
      "\"Nunez, he’s up for grabs. Would you rather not have Nunez than Sesko and Gyokeres?’ Saunders said on talkSPORT. \"They paid a lot of money for them, and I thought, ‘He’s up for grabs.’ I would take a chance on him.\"",
      "Saunders added: \"He’s got every finish in his locker, both feet, headers, he’s gone round the keeper, he’s slotted the keeper, he’s chipped the keeper, he’s scored from distance.",
      "\"We’ve seen him do every finish, but somehow he manages to conjure up a miss – I don’t know how many times he hit the post and the crossbar last season.",
      "\"There’s definitely a player in there, you look at him and think, ‘What a handful he is to play against.’",
      "\"He scored a lot of goals for Benfica in his second season and a couple of seasons ago he got 20-odd for Liverpool. I wouldn’t be surprised if Nunez goes somewhere else and scores 20 goals next season.\"",
      "With Nunez now off the books at Anfield, Liverpool are expected to sign a replacement before the transfer window shuts next month. Isak remains their primary target, however, Newcastle do not want to sell their star striker and it's thought Liverpool would need to pay at least £150m to bring the Sweden star to Merseyside.",

      "Wayne Rooney's son, Kai, may have some big boots to fill in football after his dad burst onto the scene at Everton and barely looked back, but he's enjoying his own rapid rise at Manchester United. The youngster is one of the stars of the club's academy and is enjoying an impressive time as part of the setup.",
      "The 15-year-old is stepping up to the Red Devils' Under-19 side after earning a surprise call-up for the Mladen Ramljak Tournament in Croatia, per reports. Rooney will face players four years his senior at the competition hosted by Dinamo Zagreb.",
      "The forward jumps three age groups after impressing for United already in a pre-season tournament, Northern Ireland's Super Cup NI. The youngster produced a goal and assist as his team reached the final to lose to Southampton.",
      "And now he has the opportunity to light up a tournament that has seen the likes of Luka Modric and Eduardo Camavinga shine in the past. Some way to spend the school holidays.",
      "United will be joined by Rapid Bucuresti, Juventus and Dinamo Zagreb in Group A in Croatia and get underway against the former. The winner of that group will take on the victor of Group B, which will see Paris Saint-Germain, Benfica, Bologna and Shakhtar Donetsk contend for a place in the final.",
      "The son of United's top goalscorer ever is not alone in being fast-tracked into the U19 squad either. Rooney will be joined by some of his contemporaries in the U15 and U16s, including JJ Gabriel who has been dubbed Kid Messi and the Red Devils battled to keep at the club.",
      "Rooney Sr watched from the stands when Kai competed in the tournament in Northern Ireland. The former Derby and Birmingham boss saw young Southampton ace Jude Daniels troll him by using his own celebration when scoring against United.",
      "Daniels tapped home from close range before facing the crowd and replicating Rooney's iconic punching celebration to rub salt into the wound. The youngster then fell slowly backwards for his team-mates to catch him.",
      "Rooney Jr has seen some success this year however and scored the match-winning goal when the Red Devils won the U15 Premier League Floodlit Cup North title. The academy star capped off a remarkable turnaround for his side in extra time after the team came back from three goals down with just 12 minutes left on the clock, against local rivals Manchester City.",
      "The youngster has had to contend with having a famous father too during his time coming through the youth ranks. \"A few years ago, I remember my son Kai took a penalty at St George’s Park, where we were for a tournament,\" Coleen told the Stick to Football podcast, brought to you by Sky Bet.",
      "\"It went to penalties, Kai stepped up and just skied it. Afterwards I asked him how he could take a penalty like that, and he told me he was just fuming as the goalkeeper was saying ‘Your dad’s s***’, and he got dead angry.",
      "\"It doesn’t happen to him very often, but it did then, and you can see in some games where they give you a little push. He’s strong-minded though and usually shrugs it off.\"",

      "Danny Welbeck has previously tipped Manchester United transfer target Carlos Baleba to become one of the best midfielders in the world. United head coach Ruben Amorim has mainly focussed on bolstering his attack this summer, but is turning attention to the middle of the park.",
      "The Red Devils began the transfer window by signing Matheus Cunha from Wolves for £62.5million, before going on to splash £71million on Bryan Mbeumo from Brentford, while 18-year-old defensive prospect Diego Leon also arrived in-between those arrivals.",
      "RB Leipzig striker Benjamin Sesko is also closing in on a mega-money move to Old Trafford, and it seems that once that deal is done, United could turn to Baleba, having now been linked with a swoop for the Cameroon international.",
      "The Brighton and Hove Albion midfielder, who has previously been admired by Chelsea, has caught United's eye with his impressive performances for Fabian Hurzeler's side. He has also more than impressed team-mate and former United forward Welbeck, who believes Baleba has the potential to become one of the best in world football.",
      "In an interview with BBC Radio Sussex back in November last year, Welbeck explained his thoughts on the 21-year-old. The ex-Arsenal forward said: \"He can be unstoppable. If he keeps up with that desire and passion, he can go right to the top. He’s got all of the attributes to be a world-beater.”",
      "Welbeck is not the only former United star who has been impressed by Baleba. Rio Ferdinand recently admitted he would like to see his former side try and sign the promising box-to-box midfielder.",
      "Speaking on his Rio Presents podcast, the former England and United skipper said: \"I’m being greedy, and [if] we are able to shift the other players that are surplus to requirements, I’d be going for Baleba in midfield.",
      "\"[He] beats the press on a regular basis. [He’s] confident on the ball. [He] can move, is mobile. He is a Ruben Amorim midfielder.”",
      "According to The Athletic, United have already made contact with Brighton about a potential move for Baleba. However, it's also claimed the Red Devils would need to sell some unwanted players such as Antony, Jadon Sancho and Alejandro Garnacho, before they can make a meaningful bid for Baleba.",
      "The midfielder has three years left on his deal, which gives the Seagulls plenty of room to demand a high fee. Two seasons ago, Brighton extracted £115m from Chelsea for Moises Caicedo, a Premier League record transfer at the time.",
      "It's understood Brighton may demand a similar transfer fee for Baleba, although United are thought to value him at around £70m.",

United have made a first bid - although it was lower than Newcastle's offer - and are continuing talks to strike a deal, with the Slovenia international increasingly likely to be the No.9 that Ruben Amorim has chased for much of the summer.",
      "However, the 22-year-old may be in for a stark wake-up call should he arrive in the northwest, given how Amorim has wasted no time in laying down the law since his own arrival last November. The Portuguese tactician has implemented a number of new rules since taking over from Erik ten Hag, with hopes of turning the tide at United.",
      "The first major rule that the 40-year-old implemented upon his arrival was banning his coaches from dishing out complex instructions, with the ideology that things need to be simplified before they are passed down.",
      "He also decided to ban players from using international breaks as holiday opportunities, after Marcus Rashford and Casemiro jetted off to the United States in November for leisure after being left out of their respective national teams.",
      "Amorim said of the changes: \"We as a club have to set the standards and manage that. It’s my decision if they can have five days, or three days, or three days to rest and you cannot fly. This is something that us as a club have to decide. So this must be started in the club, with us and me being responsible in that area.\"",
      "Amorim has also banned food in the dressing room on matchdays after emphasising that he looks to prioritise physical fitness within his team, while the fourth rule that Amorim has put in place sees losing teams in training sessions forced to pick up equipment used on the day.",
      "Amorim has upped his standards ahead of the new campaign, following a disastrous Premier League campaign that saw the Red Devils finish 15th in the league standings. Diogo Dalot has stressed that the club may not be for everyone at present.",
      "Speaking about Amorim's way of doing things, the Portugal international said: \"If you want to be in Manchester United, you need to match some standards. If you can't match them, it's not a place for you. The message is really clear.\"",
      "Amorim's side have made a decent impression in his first pre-season at the club. The Red Devils held a newly-promoted Leeds United to a goalless draw last month, before embarking on their Premier League Summer Series tour of the United States.",
      "They secured 2-1 and 4-1 wins over West Ham and Bournemouth, as well as a 2-2 draw with Everton. The side are now set to return to Old Trafford to face Fiorentina on Saturday, before their Premier League opener against Arsenal lands on August 17.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Manchester United’s next transfer has been branded a “bully” by a top Premier League midfielder. With United closing in on a move for RB Leipzig’s Benjamin Sesko, attention has shifted to stiffening up Ruben Amorim’s midfield.",
      "Brighton’s Carlos Baleba has emerged as the club’s number one target. It's understood contact has already been made with the south coast club, although his arrival would need to be coupled with departures following United’s summer spending spree and United have quite the job on their hands persuading Brighton to cash in on a player they rate as being worth £100m already.",
      "The 21-year-old has been a revelation since joining the Seagulls from Lille in 2023. Aston Villa midfielder Amadou Onana was at the French club at the same time and saw a young Baleba take no prisoners when he stepped up to train with the first team.",
      "Onana told the Inside Scoop: “When I arrived, he was playing with the B team. I just saw a strong kid, he’s the strongest kid I’ve ever seen. Jacked! He used to come up [to train with the first team] and be free, he’d bully the pros.”",
      "Onana, 23, said he wasn’t surprised that Baleba is now rated so highly, as he praised his down-to-earth nature. He said: “He’s done his thing and I always knew he had what it takes to get to the high level. He’s a really good kid, really humble, works hard.”",
      "Brighton don't want to sell Baleba this year and will demand £100m given he has three years left on his contract. United value him at closer to £70m and it has been suggested that Baleba could ask the Seagulls to lower their asking price. But with Brighton preferring to sell in 2026 and planning for the upcoming campaign with him, they're unlikely to budge.",
      "Brighton chief executive Paul Barber has tried to play down the speculation surrounding Baleba. He told a fans’ forum: \"We've got some great talent, there's always going to be interest in our players. Manchester United have not been in touch with me. So from that point of view, speculation is speculation. We will always try to make sure we sell our best players at the right time, not just for the player but for us.",
      "\"If we end up doing that with any player, it's with the view to leave Fabian [head coach Hurzeler] with a very competitive squad, whatever happens. We don't want to sell our best players.",
      "\"Carlos is a fantastic talent who has a lot of years ahead of him. We hope he will be here for many years to come. But it's something that, as always, is subjective to the dynamics of the football world, which isn't always predictable.\"",
      "First, United are looking to finalise a deal for Sesko, having lodged a bid of around £65.3m plus £8.7m in add-ons. Newcastle also want the Slovenian, but he is believed to be favouring a move to Old Trafford.",

      "Rio Ferdinand has said \"Who’s a Baleba???\" on social media after Manchester United had made moves to potentially sign Brighton midfielder Carlos Baleba.",
      "The Cameroon star enjoyed a stellar year last season and the Seagulls have no plans to cash in any time soon, but that hasn't stopped the Red Devils trying to see whether it would be possible to do a deal.",
      "Ferdinand's tweet appears to be a play on words of the phrase \"who's a believer\" as the Manchester outfit attempt to secure another major deal this summer. Those at Old Trafford are aware the move may be unrealistic, especially if they get a deal for RB Leipzig's Benjamin Sesko over the line.",
      "Baleba has three years left on his contract at the Amex but is proving to be one of the Premier League's best in his position. He is the latest in a long line of players who have joined Brighton as relatively unknown quantities before morphing into a genuine superstar.",
      "United's current focus is on landing Sesko from RB Leipzig and they have jumped ahead of Newcastle in the transfer race. There is an acceptance though that any move, which could cost more than £70million, will make a swoop for the Brighton star very difficult - particularly with the Seagulls valuing Baleba at £100m.",
      "A striker is currently the priority for Ruben Amorim, who has already bought in Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo for more than £120m. If they can secure a No.9 then a midfielder capable of playing in the number six role is next on their hit list and Baleba would fit that profile.",
      "United's two midfielders need to be highly energetic and smart off the ball with Amorim's system leaving them to run the engine room. The likes of Kobbie Mainoo, Casemiro and Manuel Ugarte have played in those roles last term, but the club will look to make improvements if they can.",
      "The Brighton star previously said on all the speculation surrounding him: \"If they can help me, I’ll accept that help to push forward and develop. So, I just work to help my team and for myself, to progress for the future. In return, everyone who helps me wants me to go to the highest level. And if there are big clubs who want me, it’s not something that worries me or gets me excited. I just need to work hard and keep a cool head.\"",
      "Brighton are under no pressure to sell and have been making plans to keep Baleba this term, before letting him move to a so-called bigger club next summer. By then, they hope, they can land a fee worth more than the £115m Chelsea paid to prise Moises Caicedo to Stamford Bridge from the south coast.",
      "Ferdinand is backing his former side, who finished 15th last term, to make notable improvements and believes either seventh or eighth is on the cards. However he said he admitted: \"Revisit this if we get one or two more signings and I might change my answer.\"",

In a brief statement they said: \"Wednesday squad update: Andrija Maksimovic is back in Leipzig, but is training individually today. Benjamin Sesko and Lukas Klostermann are also working individually.\"",

      "Benjamin Sesko is heading to Manchester United after snubbing Newcastle United, a decision that sees the Slovenian forgo an opportunity to play in this season's Champions League.",
      "And while that should be seen as a coup for Old Trafford decision-makers, evidence that despite their decade of decline they remain a bigger draw than a side that finished in the top five last season, it is a huge blow for the Toon who still fear the sale of Alexander Isak to Liverpool.",
      "But there are also knock-on effects for the dressing room Sesko is heading towards in the north west with his impending arrival set to alter the roles of team-mates - and leave the future of at least one star in serious jeopardy.",
      "Here is how United’s latest arrival could impact Rasmus Hojlund, Joshua Zirkzee plus new arrivals Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo.",
      "After two frustrating seasons in which he has struggled to score consistently with the confidence draining slowly from him, speculation for much of the summer to date has surrounded the Denmark striker being sold.",
      "Sesko’s arrival will increase the likelihood of that happening significantly with United willing to accept a fee in the range of half the £72m they paid Atalanta for Hojliund in the summer of 2023. A number of Serie A sides have been linked but no interest has translated into a formal offer yet.",
      "Hojlund himself is determined to transform his fortunes and was unfazed about transfer speculation with the likes of Sesko: \"I think my plan is very clear and that's for me to stay and fight for my spot, whatever happens.\"",
      "Injury problems may have hindered an average debut season at the club but he does have the size and skillset that could provide Ruben Amorim with scope to mix things up.",
      "Expect him to be an impact sub behind Sesko, which may see the pressure be taken off the big Dutchman and United fans will hope that can allow him to play with a bit more freedom when given the opportunity.",
      "The Brazil star thrived cutting in from the wing while at Wolves and Sesko being the central member of the front three will surely bring the best out of Cunha. He linked up impressively with Jorgen Strand Larsen as the middleman at Molineux and Amorim will expect similar with Sesko.",
      "United’s other big summer arrival is in a similar boat to Cunha.",
      "At Brentford last season he spent a lot of time operating more centrally but arguably his best work in West London came when providing more width, stretching opposition defences and simultaneously hurting them himself by switching inside or ensuring more space for his team-mates to thrive.",

The Red Devils are confident they have beaten Newcastle to his signing, with the deal set to take their summer spending to around £200m in total.",

      "Signing both Sesko and Baleba in this window would require significant sales elsewhere, something which doesn't appear to be on the cards. There is likely to be some money coming in, with Jadon Sancho, Alejandro Garnacho and Antony all potentially leaving before the window shuts, but that would counterbalanced by the outlay for Sesko.",
      "United have already spent big on Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo while also bringing in young left-back Diego Leon. A move for Baleba is likely to have to wait until 2026, despite Amorim having limited options in front of the defence.",
      "Baleba joined Brighton from Lille in the summer of 2023, just a fortnight after the Seagulls sold fellow midfielder Moises Caicedo to Chelsea. The Cameroon international made 34 league appearances last term, scoring his first goals for the club, and was asked about his future in May.",

The Swede worked tirelessly on his first Emirates outing on Wednesday night but was starved of service as the Gunners were beaten 3-2 at home by Villarreal in their penultimate pre-season fixture. Gyokeres was subbed on 63 minutes but Arteta has no doubts he'll be in a position to hit the ground running this season, starting at Old Trafford.",
      "Arteta said of his marquee £63.7million summer capture: \"I think mentally and understanding what he needs to do, he will be 100 per cent or more because he's so willing. He's so confident as well that he can deliver for us straight away, I have no doubt he'll be in a really good place.\"",
      "Gyokeres has endured a gruelling, whirlwind summer, but Arteta is adamant he noticed immediate chemistry with his new Arsenal team-mates on the pitch.",
      "When asked how long it may take to click for the 27-year-old striker, the Spaniard added: \"I hope just days, every day in training I think he's getting a really good feeling.",
      "\"I think he's built connections as well outside of the pitch, which I think is really important with players that are going to help him to be in the position that he needs to get in.",
      "\"He hasn't trained really with the team for two months, so he's done five or six sessions now before today. I think he will take another step in the right direction on Saturday and he will be in a better condition.\"",
      "Teenage sensation Max Dowman dazzled from the bench but Arteta revealed the 15-year-old starlet is now heading on holiday for a well-earned break. The Arsenal boss was unable to provide any assurances that Dowman will be making his top-flight debut imminently ahead of the new season.",
      "He said of the nimble attacker: \"Let's see how it goes. Let's go into Saturday, into his break as well. He needs a little break because he hasn't had any holidays really. So, in the next few days, he's going to have a break, which I think he needs. Then the following week, he'll be ready again to go.\"",
      "Arsenal play Athletic Club on Saturday in their final pre-season fixture before they gear up for the trip to Manchester United. Arteta has no doubt his side are the finished article - they now just have to prove it after three second-place finishes.",
      "He continued: \"We know we need to make the next step and we're going to be better. The same as any other team, when you look at the competition, the pieces on the puzzle that they're adding, some of the ones are big ones as well. So, we're all trying to be at our best and ready to compete to win the Premier League.\"",

      "Manchester United icon Paul Scholes has questioned whether Arsenal boss Mikel Arteta even wanted new striker signing Viktor Gyökeres. Scholes also fears that the Swede may not adapt well to the Gunners' high levels of possession.",
      "After struggling without a bona fide No. 9 for some time, Arsenal finally completed a deal for Sporting CP star Gyökeres last month, snapping him up after a summer of speculation for roughly £64million.",
      "The Gunners fought off competition from Premier League rivals United for the 27-year-old, but Red Devils legend Scholes has now questioned whether head coach Arteta wanted the player, and whether Gyökeres will prosper in light of Arsenal's high-possession playstyle.",
      "\"[Arsenal needed a] Centre forward, I just wonder if you've chosen the right one,\" Scholes declared on The Overlap Fan Debate. \"Because there was a lot of um-ing and ah-ing about it, I wondered if Mikel Arteta really wanted him, as the main one he wants? I'm not too sure, and he's got him now.",
      "\"He's had a really strange career path - Brighton, Coventry, and then he's gone to Sporting Lisbon and his goal record is absolutely brilliant – you can't take it away from him.\"",
      "Gyökeres netted a staggering 97 times in 102 matches for Sporting in all competitions over the past two seasons, but Scholes doubts whether the Gunners' style of play suits him.",
      "\"If there's any team that he could go to and create chances, then it should be Arsenal and it should be a really good match,\" continued Scholes.",
      "\"The only thing I'd say against Gyökeres really is that with Sporting Lisbon, he's probably playing on the counter-attack a lot, in Europe especially.",
      "\"You think of Arsenal, they have the ball an awful lot, is he going to be clever enough to make these runs in behind? A lot of him that you see, he's sprinting from the halfway line almost.",
      "\"You can't keep up with him, he's ramming people, he's quick and he's smashing the ball in. Is he going to be that clever striker – we know Isak can do that. Can Gyökeres do that?\"",
      "One player who thinks that Gyökeres will fare well at the Emirates is club captain Martin Odegaard, who sang his new team-mate's praises during Arsenal's pre-season visit to Hong Kong.",
      "\"I think you've all seen what he's done in his career so far,\" claimed Odegaard. \"Especially the last season at Sporting, the numbers speak for themselves. He's a very complete player. He's physical, strong, fast, good finisher and intelligent as well.",
      "\"I think he's a very complete striker and you can also see the hunger, the energy he brings. I'm really excited to have him with the team. He's only trained a few times, but you can already see the quality, the energy, and the willingness. I'm excited to have a pitch with him.\"",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Incoming Manchester United recruit Benjamin Sesko is the top scorer under the age of 23 in Europe's five biggest leagues over the past two seasons. Ruben Amorim appears to be getting a new No. 9 in the form of RB Leipzig star Sesko, who is the subject of a £65.3million bid from the Red Devils, which could rise to nearly £74m if certain add-ons are achieved.",
      "Premier League rivals Newcastle have also shown interest in the striker and have put forward a more lucrative proposal than United's, but the 22-year-old's preference is a move to Old Trafford.",
      "Sesko is currently training separately from his Leipzig colleagues, according to a statement released by his club, and while some have expressed doubts about his abilities and hefty price tag, his goal-scoring statistics speak for themselves.",
      "This puts him one goal ahead of Real Madrid and England sensation Jude Bellingham, and five goals ahead of Florian Wirtz, whose summer transfer to Liverpool could set a British record if certain add-ons are met.",
      "In fourth place on the list is Bayern Munich phenom Jamal Musiala, who has racked up 33 goals during this period, followed by PSG's Bradley Barcola and German ace Maximilian Beier on 26.",
      "Sesko's impressive goal-scoring record, outperforming some of Europe's top young talents, will be a welcome sound to Amorim's ears. It suggests that the 22-year-old won't be overwhelmed when he arrives in Manchester, and United are fully committed to Sesko, having already agreed personal terms with him.",
      "Current Red Devil Rasmus Hojlund, who also scored 26 goals during this period, underscores the gap between him and Sesko. Despite not being entirely goal-shy since his £72m move to Old Trafford in 2023, the Dane has struggled to meet high expectations.",
      "Now, it seems likely that Sesko will join United, and Hojlund is reportedly prepared for the possibility of being pushed out if the Slovenian signs. Just two seasons after his £72m transfer, Hojlund could be available for as little as £30m, less than half of what was originally paid for him.",
      "However, during United's pre-season tour of the US, Hojlund expressed optimism about his future, stating: \"I think my plan is very clear and that is for me to stay and fight for my spot, whatever happens.",
      "\"I'm still very young. I think people forget that sometimes. I'm only 22. Obviously, not every striker is scoring 100 goals at the age of 22 (like Erling Haaland). But I've learned a lot, I think you can see in my game.",
      "\"I'm starting to develop and become even better in the basics. Now it's just about for me to sharpen myself and I've done very well in the pre-season so far. Just focusing on continuing that.",
      "\"Competition is fine with me. It sharpens me. I'm more than ready. I'm feeling sharp, so I'm welcoming everything that comes. I think it's good with competition and it only sharpens the team.\"",

      "The Magpies have endured a difficult window with a number of their targets choosing to look elsewhere. But Eddie Howe is looking to land the defender from the Italian club having already seen a bid for Thiaw rejected by the Rossoneri.",
      "Reports in Germany claim that a fresh offer is likely to come from Newcastle. The German international's versatility has proved a huge plus with Thiaw playing centrally, as a right-back and a defensive midfielder in the past.",
      "Negotiations continue between the Premier League side and their Serie A rivals, whom they played in the Champions League two years ago. Schalke, who Thiaw played for before his move to Milan, also stand to benefit from any possible deal due to their sell-on clause.",
      "So far this summer Newcastle's only major signing has been their £55million capture of Anthony Elanga, who joined after an impressive year at Nottingham Forest. He will bolster their frontline but other than him Howe has struggled to get new faces through the door.",
      "Their latest blow could come with Sesko potentially heading to Manchester. The Red Devils are increasingly confident of signing the Slovenian from RB Leipzig after the striker indicated his preference to join the club with both options available to him.",
      "Newcastle are interested in Sesko and made the first move with their initial bid, but the young striker favours a move to Old Trafford, where he is due to sign a five-year deal. The Magpies can offer Champions League football, but that doesn't seem to have been enough to tempt him.",
      "The problem for Newcastle is they want to get a top class striker through the door before they allow Alexander Isak to leave the club. The Swede is pushing for the exit door with Liverpool eyeing up a move that could cost them as much as £150m if the Magpies valuation is met.",
      "Isak has been told to train away from the first-team having also missed their pre-season trip to Asia. He would leave a huge void in the Newcastle attack with Howe also seeing the likes of Joao Pedro, who was on his shortlist, opt for Chelsea ahead of a move to St James' Park.",

      "Benjamin Sesko's decision to ignore Manchester United's interest in favour of staying at RB Leipzig was deemed the correct one by Gary Neville. The 22-year-old joined the Bundesliga side in 2023 and made an instant impact, scoring 18 goals in all competitions in his first season.",
      "His impressive performances saw him subject to interest from the Premier League giants as well as Arsenal last summer. But the Slovenia international opted to remain in Germany and ended up signing a new deal.",
      "While there were reports that a gentleman's agreement existed between Sesko's camp and the club that would allow him to leave this year for a reasonable fee, his contract tied him down in Leipzig until 2029.",
      "Following his debut campaign in the Bundesliga, Sesko - who is nearing a move to Old Trafford this month - was in action at Euro 2024, and it was Neville who was on punditry duty for Slovenia's 1-1 draw with Denmark.",
      "The Manchester United legend discussed the forward's ability and admitted that his decision to stay in Germany, which was not confirmed at the time, was best for his personal development as a footballer.",
      "\"[He's got] goals, youth and physically,\" the ex-England defender said on ITV. \"I think we are moving back to having a big physical striker up front, the game seems to have flipped a little bit by having big defenders and big strikers.",
      "\"He is someone who has so much potential and you can see why Premier League clubs are interested. But I can also see why, what is being suggested, he is staying at Leipzig for another year.",
      "\"It will give him the chance to grow without the spotlight you get on you in the Premier League and just develop his game a little bit more,\" Neville added. While United could have done with Sesko's talents in what was a dismal campaign last season, the striker enjoyed another fruitful season with Leipzig, scoring 21 goals in all competitions and contributing six assists.",
      "The added experience Sesko's collected from leading the line for a European club in a top-five league and the Champions League may benefit United even more this season.",
      "The 6'5\" ace looked to be closing in on a transfer to Newcastle after the Magpies bid £72million plus £2.1m for his services, but he made clear his intention to join Ruben Amorim's side after their bid of £65m plus £8m was tabled, according to The Athletic.",

      "After finishing 15th in the Premier League last season, Manchester United have had no choice but to attack in this summer's transfer window.",
      "A bottom half finish, a trophyless campaign and another season that featured more upheaval off the pitch meant United signed off for the summer with very little optimism for the 2025/26 campaign.",
      "The 1-0 defeat to Tottenham Hotspur in the Europa League final in Bilbao ended United's hopes of qualifying for this season's Champions League, meaning they will be without European football for the first time since 2014/15 this term.",
      "The biggest concern immediately raised on the back of United's failure to qualify for Europe's premier club competition was about this summer's window. With no European football on offer, it was feared United could find life difficult in the market.",
      "Instead, with just under four weeks to go until the September 1 deadline, United are still in with a chance of having their strongest summer window in years - and much of it stems from rolling back the years and readopting a former blueprint.",
      "Having finished last season with a negative goal difference of -10 in the Premier League, United have rightfully prioritised attacking signings in this summer's transfer window, so far bringing in Matheus Cunha from Wolves and Bryan Mbeumo from Brentford.",
      "The duo were among the Premier League's best players last season, scoring 35 league goals between them. United wasted no time in signing Cunha, triggering his £62.5million release clause on the opening day of the window, before setting their sights on Mbeumo and eventually getting him through the door last month.",
      "Cunha, who is well-versed in a three-at-the-back system, is a tailor-made fit for the left-sided No.10 spot in Ruben Amorim's team, whereas Mbeumo offers a multifunctional option in the attacking department. Both players are goalscorers and were linked with moves to Premier League clubs that could have offered them Champions League football this coming season before putting pen to paper on long-term deals at Old Trafford.",
      "Cunha, who finalised his move to United on June 12, became the first attacker United had signed from a Premier League counterpart on a permanent basis since Alexis Sanchez arrived from Arsenal in January 2018.",
      "United were big spenders in the 2017/18 campaign, making four statement signings, of which three already played in the Premier League. Prior to signing Sanchez in the mid-season window, Romelu Lukaku and Nemanja Matic arrived from Everton and Chelsea respectively ahead of the start of the season.",
      "Since signing the aforementioned trio, United have not signed three Premier League players in the same window. However, that could change before the end of this window amid their interest in Brighton & Hove Albion midfielder Carlos Baleba.",
      "Despite making attacking signings a priority this summer, United are desperate to strengthen their midfield before the bell sounds at the start of next month. They lack energy and aggression in the middle of the pitch, making the addition of a new midfielder vitally important.",
      "Baleba, 21, joined Brighton from Lille in 2023 and has gone from strength-to-strength ever since, becoming one of the most exciting youngsters in the Premier League. According to The Athletic, United have 'made contact' with Brighton via intermediaries.",
      "Although the Cameroonian is only 21 and has just 61 Premier League appearances to his name, he has quickly proven he is a quality operator at this level. He was one of the best all-round midfielders in the division last season, demonstrating he can provide the traits United are desperately lacking in the engine room.",
      "Baleba, who has previously addressed his hunger for winning silverware, is another example of Brighton's fabulous scouting system. The Seagulls are the masters of unearthing hidden gems, polishing them and selling them on for a handsome profit.",
      "Although no transfer offers the guarantee of success, there is less risk involved when signing players who are already proven in the league you need them to perform in. Cunha and Mbeumo are statement signings for United, and Baleba would be the same if he were to end up at Old Trafford.",
      "After taking one too many gambles on overseas imports in recent years, it has been refreshing to see United roll back the years this summer. Mbeumo and Cunha are excellent additions and have the necessary qualities to thrive in M16, meaning Baleba could potentially follow suit.",
      "This particular approach rarely let Ferguson down.",

      "Rasmus Hojlund delivered an interview to get his message across during Manchester United's pre-season tour in the United States.",
      "There has been uncertainty around Hojlund's future at Old Trafford throughout the summer, but he reiterated in a Stateside chat with journalists that he wants to stay.",
      "Speaking about his future in the US, Hojlund said: \"I think my plan is very clear and that is for me to stay and fight for my spot, whatever happens. I'm still very young. I think people forget that sometimes. I'm only 22.",
      "\"Obviously, not every striker is scoring 100 goals at the age of 22 (like Erling Haaland). But I've learned a lot, I think you can see in my game. I'm starting to develop and become even better in the basics.",
      "\"Now it's just about for me to sharpen myself and I've done very well in the pre-season so far. Just focusing on continuing that.",
      "\"Competition is fine with me. It sharpens me. I'm more than ready. I'm feeling sharp, so I'm welcoming everything that comes. I think it's good with competition and it only sharpens the team.\"",
      "Those comments weren't a surprise, considering Hojlund also outlined his desire to stay in Manchester when he spoke to journalists while on international duty with Denmark in May.",
      "\"I have a contract until 2030, so I expect to play for Manchester United,\" Hojlund said. \"I'm looking forward to going on a summer vacation, and then I'm fully dedicated to the project that's underway.\"",
      "The mixed zone comes alive when footballers have a message to convey. Asking players for a few minutes to chat as they leave the stadium can be a thankless task, but every now and then someone wants to get something off their chest.",
      "Hojlund's admission of wanting to stay at United is certainly not as juicy as Mohamed Salah speaking to Liverpool correspondents about his contract situation outside St Mary's Stadium last season, but it was still interesting to hear Hojlund is keen to fight for his place.",
      "However, despite Hojlund wanting to remain at the club, it's understood that the striker is ultimately resigned to leaving if United complete a deal to sign Benjamin Sekso this summer.",
      "United are prepared to make a loss on Hojlund, who was signed in a £72million deal from Atalanta in 2023, to help get their ducks in a row, meaning the Dane could be a victim of Sesko's arrival.",
      "In an ideal world, Hojlund would be kept to play second fiddle to Sesko. He would likely improve with less pressure on his shoulders and he is a better player than he was able to show last term.",
      "But United will take their summer spending to close to £200m if they secure Sesko and they must begin to offload sellable assets so they can comply with Profit and Sustainability Rules.",
      "Hojlund joined United for an up-front fee of £64m and is two years into a three-year contract, so his PSR value is calculated at £38.4m. United are understood to be open to selling Hojlund for £30m.",
      "Although Hojlund was incredibly disappointing last season, some supporters will be sympathetic because he could be forced out when he wants to stay.",
      "That will probably hurt Hojlund's confidence and he is still a young player. But football is a cut-throat business and United are not a charity. He wouldn't be in this situation if he'd scored more goals last season.",
      "Hojlund wants to stay, but the indicators suggest he will not get what he wants.",

Ayden Heaven is currently the obvious pick on the left of the back-three, but will face fierce competition from Lisandro Martinez once he returns from his anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury.",
      "In the middle, Matthijs de Ligt and Harry Maguire are battling it out to make it into Amorim's first choice XI, and both will believe they are worthy of winning the place. De Ligt, though, has been the more prominent figure in pre-season.",
      "As far as the wing-backs are concerned, Amad and Patrick Dorgu are obvious picks. Amad was United's most improved player by a country mile last season, adapting to Amorim's 3-4-2-1 system really well, and Dorgu has enjoyed a strong pre-season, providing the attacking thrust Amorim expects from his wing-backs.",
      "Following the additions of Cunha and Mbeumo, captain Bruno Fernandes is expected to be a regular operator in midfield this season. He frequently operated as a No.8 in the second half of last term and produced some of his best performances from a deeper position.",
      "Alongside him, Baleba, if successfully extracted from the Amex Stadium, will expect to go straight into Amorim's first-choice XI and add bite, energy and aggression to United's midfield. The Cameroonian, 21, is renowned for his energy, aggressive style of play and being able to progress the ball, meaning he provides exactly what United are looking for in a midfielder.",
      "Manuel Ugarte, Kobbie Mainoo and Casemiro will all equally believe they are worthy of starting, but United would not splash out potentially north of £70m to put Baleba on the bench.",
      "As already documented, Mbeumo and Cunha are the leading candidates to occupy the two No.10 positions. The former, in the eyes of some, should be deployed as the right wing-back amid his history as a winger, but he scored 20 Premier League goals last season and should be played as close to the goal as possible.",
      "Cunha is a seasoned playmaker and well-versed as a No.10 in a three-at-the-back formation. He has enjoyed a solid pre-season and has offered flashes of what he will bring to the table.",
      "At the tip of the attack, Sesko will be a guaranteed starter. He is set to cost north of £70m and United are in desperate need of fresh blood up front.",
      "The 22-year-old should replace Rasmus Hojlund as United's chief marksman and be supported by Cunha and Mbeumo, who scored 35 Premier League goals between them for Wolves and Brentford last season.",
      "Dream United XI with two more signings: Onana; Yoro, De Ligt, Heaven; Amad, Baleba, Fernandes, Dorgu; Mbeumo, Cunha; Sesko.",

      "Ross joined the MEN in August 2021. He was appointed Sport Content Editor in February 2022.",
      "Manchester United are confident Benjamin Sesko will opt for a move to Old Trafford over St James' Park, but anything can happen in the transfer window.",
      "Until that contract has been signed, there will be no temptation to tick 'sign a striker' off the summer to-do list, especially if there's sudden movement in Liverpool's pursuit of Alexander Isak that has a knock-on effect on Newcastle's chase of Sesko.",
      "Sesko has earmarked this summer as his time move on from RB Leipzig after two years with the Bundesliga outfit, and his agent, Elvis Basanovic, has been keen to fill as many column inches as possible with his client's name.",
      "Speaking recently, Basanovic explained what Sesko would be looking for when choosing his next destination, saying: \"He will move from RB Leipzig only when we recognise a special club. A special project with a special coach.\"",
      "So, do United fit the bill? One of their summer recruits certainly seems to think so.",
      "Matheus Cunha joined Ruben Amorim at the first press conference on United's pre-season tour of America last month.",
      "During the press conference, Cunha was asked why he chose United, and he replied: \"It's an easy question to answer: United was always my dream club. When you can make your dreams come true, it's an easy decision.",
      "\"Ruben was a big part, he talked to me and showed how important I was to him so it was easy to make the choice.\"",
      "He was then asked how he intends to cope with the pressure of representing a club of United's stature. He replied: \"The pressure in this club is not pressure, it's a privilege. This is one of the biggest clubs in the world. When Ruben came to me and showed me the project I feel like it is a challenge I want for my career. United needs to be there and I want to be part of the process.\"",
      "Cunha's articulate responses show just what is on offer for any player of interest to United.",
      "The chance to be part of a project that hopes to take one of the biggest clubs in the world back to the summit of English football is one not to be missed, and in Amorim they have a manager with the character and charisma needed to spearhead said project.",
      "If Sesko wants a special club, a special project and a special coach, he need look no further.",
      "The countdown is on to the 2025/26 Premier League campaign - and our pre-season guide is the ideal way to prepare for the action ahead.",

      "According to a report by The Athletic, United have 'made contact' with Brighton, via intermediaries, to explore the possibility of signing him before the end of this summer's transfer window.",
      "Although United have rightfully prioritised attacking signings so far this summer, it is no secret they also want to add a midfielder to their ranks ahead of the transfer window closing on September 1.",
      "The Reds, who face Fiorentina in their final pre-season friendly at Old Trafford on Saturday, want to add a sense of energy and aggression to their pool of midfielders, and Baleba, 21, would supply those traits.",
      "Signed by Brighton from French club Lille in August 2023, the midfielder has gone from strength-to-strength since arriving in England, establishing himself as one of the Premier League's most exciting midfield operators. He has an enormous amount of potential and is capable of doing a little bit of everything in the engine room.",
      "He has racked up 61 appearances in the Premier League in the last two seasons and has been compared to a collection of household names. Brighton are the masters of unearthing hidden gems and selling them on for a huge profit, and Baleba could be the latest off the production line.",
      "With the utmost respect to Brighton, who are one of the best run clubs in the country, making terrific strides over the last 15 years or so, United are a far superior juggernaut and can offer players a better chance of winning silverware. And winning trophies is something Baleba lives for.",
      "Asked if winning trophies is achieveable at Brighton, he added: \"For me, there are opportunities everywhere. I can win trophies here with Brighton, I can win trophies at another club.",
      "\"My ambition is to just win trophies everywhere I go. Just doing that and making the world happy.\"",
      "That sort of mentality is just the sort mentality United need in the dressing room. The Reds' history is built on silverware and success.",
      "Head coach Ruben Amorim wants to lead United back to their former glories and to achieve that mission he needs players of the right character. Like Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha, if Baleba were to join United this summer, he would be another player prepared to join the club without the attraction of Champions League football.",

Asked if this summer would be the right time to sell the 21-year-old, Barber revealed an insight into the current situation regarding Baleba and United.",
      "After Hurzeler jokingly seemed to avoid the question for Barber to answer, the Seagulls chief, via BBC Sussex, said: \"We've got some great talent, there's always going to be interest in our players.",
      "\"Manchester United have not been in touch with me. So from that point of view, speculation is speculation. We will always try to make sure we sell our best players at the right time, not just for the player but for us.",
      "\"If we end up doing that with any player, it's with the view to leave Fabian with a very competitive squad, whatever happens. We don't want to sell our best players.",
      "\"Carlos is a fantastic talent who has a lot of years ahead of him. We hope he will be here for many years to come. But it's something that, as always, is subjective to the dynamics of the football world which isn't always predictable.\"",

      "Manchester United are closing in on a young striker for a fee in excess of £70million for the second time in two years.",
      "Rasmus Hojlund did not arrive with Premier League experience and his time at Old Trafford has not gone as hoped. There is also no guarantee that Benjamin Sesko will succeed in England.",
      "United are rolling the dice with Sesko after Aston Villa reiterated Ollie Watkins was not for sale this summer. Watkins would have been a similar signing to Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo, who are both established Premier League players, but talks are advancing with RB Leipzig over a move for Sesko.",
      "United have bid €75million (£65.3m) plus €10m (£8.7) in add-ons in an attempt to sign Sesko. Newcastle have offered a more lucrative package to Leipzig, but the player's preference is set to be decisive.",
      "The expectation is that United and Leipzig will agree on a slightly higher fee than the initial bid.",
      "Fans who have been season-ticket holders at Old Trafford for years will wonder how paying such a significant fee for a raw striker is now considered normal, but the modern market is grossly inflated.",
      "United will essentially pay the going rate for one of the most promising young forwards in Europe, but they are investing in potential and Hojlund is an example of the danger of those deals.",
      "Watkins would have been a safer bet at a time when Ruben Amorim can not afford to take risks. Watkins has scored 75 goals in 184 appearances in the Premier League and demonstrated his quality with England at Euro 2024.",
      "There would have been a higher chance of Watkins hitting the ground running at United, but that point is redundant when Aston Villa always seemed destined to say he wasn't for sale.",
      "In comparison, Sesko had earmarked this summer for a move away from Leipzig and Arsenal were the front-runners to sign him at the start of the window. Arsenal opted to sign Viktor Gyökeres from Sporting Lisbon instead, which opened the door for United and Newcastle to battle it out for Sesko.",
      "It doesn't make much sense to harp on about Watkins being more suited to a transfer to United than Sesko because one player wasn't for sale, and the other player was up for grabs.",
      "Having said that, concerns can be voiced about Sesko's move. He is younger than Hojlund and will need time to adapt in the Premier League. Will history repeat itself and the pressure of leading the attack become a burden on Sesko's shoulders? It's possible his time at United will be similar to Hojlund's.",
      "On the other hand, it's entirely possible that Sesko is better equipped to succeed at Old Trafford and makes an immediate impact, scoring goals and providing presence in the opposition box.",
      "Amorim will desperately hope it's the latter. United's head coach needs a dependable goalscorer and Sesko should be targeting 15 goals in his first season.",
      "Christopher Vivell has been crucial in the proposed deal for Sesko, to the extent that Sesko will feel like a 'Vivell signing'. United's director of recruitment oversaw the signing of Sesko during his stint at Leipzig and holds him in high regard.",
      "And when Leipzig signed Sesko in the summer of 2022, Vivell said: \"Sesko is among the top international talents and has enormous potential to become a top player as well. He has everything it takes, is extremely fast, has tremendous jumping ability, and is very strong in the air.\"",
      "Vivell believes Sesko can develop into one of the world's best strikers, but United sources said the same when Hojlund arrived from Atalanta in a deal worth £72million two years ago.",
      "It will be a disaster if Sesko isn't a success in Manchester, given that his profile is similar to Hojlund's, albeit he has shown more than Hojlund did before his move to United.",
      "Sesko has 39 goals in 87 appearances for RB Leipzig and his record for Slovenia (16 goals in 41 games) is encouraging. Sesko was a livewire at Euro 2024 and his explosiveness will help him in the Premier League.",
      "The 22-year-old could prove to be an outstanding signing if he continues to develop in the next few seasons. Sesko obviously comes with risk but there is plenty of potential there.",
      "Every United fan will be hoping lightning does not strike twice.",

      "Danny Welbeck tipped Carlos Baleba to become one of the best in his position, before Manchester United identified him as a transfer target.",
      "United head coach Ruben Amorim has been busy enhancing his attack this summer but is now shifting focus to midfield reinforcements. The Red Devils kicked off their transfer activity by acquiring Matheus Cunha from Wolves for a hefty £62.5million, followed by a £71m outlay on Bryan Mbeumo from Brentford, with 18-year-old defensive talent Diego Leon joining in the midst of those signings.",
      "Benjamin Sesko is nearing a high-profile switch to Old Trafford. It appears once a deal for the RB Leipzig ace is finalised, United may well pursue Baleba, who has been a shining light for Brighton & Hove Albion.",
      "He has previously caught the attention of Chelsea in the past, impressing with his performances under Fabian Hurzeler. His abilities have not only caught United's interest but also earned praise from team-mate and Red Devils academy graduate Welbeck.",
      "Speaking to BBC Radio Sussex in November last year, Welbeck shared his views on the 21-year-old midfielder. The former Arsenal player said: \"He can be unstoppable.",
      "\"If he keeps up with that desire and passion, he can go right to the top. He's got all of the attributes to be a world-beater.\"",
      "Welbeck isn't the only ex-United player taken with Baleba's talent. Rio Ferdinand has also expressed his desire to see the young midfielder at Old Trafford.",
      "On his Rio Presents podcast, the former England and United captain said: \"I'm being greedy, and [if] we are able to shift the other players that are surplus to requirements, I'd be going for Baleba in midfield.",
      "\"[He] beats the press on a regular basis. [He's] confident on the ball. [He] can move, is mobile. He is a Ruben Amorim midfielder.\"",
      "The Athletic reports United have initiated talks with Brighton regarding Baleba, but they would need to offload some players deemed surplus, like Antony, Jadon Sancho and Alejandro Garnacho, before tabling a significant offer for him. With three years remaining on his contract, Brighton are in a strong position to command a hefty fee for Baleba.",
      "Previously, the Seagulls received a record-breaking £115m from Chelsea for Moises Caicedo. Brighton might ask for a similar amount for Baleba, although United reportedly value him closer to £70m.",

      "United take on the Italian side at Old Trafford on Saturday afternoon (12.45pm). It’s the side’s final pre-season game before the Premier League opener against Arsenal on Sunday, 17 Augusts (4.30pm kick-off).",
      "The match will see more than 50,000 fans in attendance, with De Gea making his return to the club where he spent 12 years. He left United on a free transfer in the summer of 2023, and joined Fiorentina a year later.",
      "Ahead of the match, De Gea has hinted at his excitement, writing: “See you soon,” to the official United X (formerly Twitter) account.",
      "It seems Fernandes shares that excitement.The midfielder has shared a United post on his Instagram stories, and added the caption: “See you soon my friend @d_degeaofficial.”",
      "Fernandes has also replied to De Geas’ latest post on Instagram with “Mi Portero”, which translates into English as “My goalkeeper.”",
      "They’re not the only messages that Fernandes has sent De Gea about his return to Old Trafford. In a video shared on United’s official social media accounts, he says: “David my friend. Can’t wait to see you at The Snapdragon Cup. Hope you enjoy being back at Old Trafford to see your fans, to see your hours, to see your home.",
      "“At the same time, I hope I score some goals against you and we enjoy the day together. See you soon my friend.”",
      "The game against United will be Fiorentina’s third in England over the last few weeks. They fell to a 2-0 defeat against Leicester City last Sunday, a game in which De Gea was left on the bench.",
      "They then drew 0-0 with Nottingham Forest on Wednesday night with the goalkeeper playing the full 90 minutes of the game.",

      "Each deal has provided varied circumstances. Leon's agreement to move to England from Paraguay was finalised in January and Cunha became signing number one of the summer quickly.",
      "However, it took the club a month to go from registering official interest in Mbeumo to announcing him following weeks of negotiations with Brentford. Now, with the window now in its final week, United are turning the screw.",
      "United have bid €75million (£65.3m) plus €10m (£8.7m) in add-ons, a deal which would see their spending surpass the £185m mark. It has widely been reported that a striker, midfielder and goalkeeper are all positions on the agenda this summer and it seems as though their next move is being explored.",
      "David Ornstein of The Athletic has suggested that United have acted to better Amorim's midfield by showing interest in Brighton & Hove Albion's Carlos Baleba. It's said that, via intermediaries, the Reds have made contact with the Seagulls to explore the conditions for a move.",
      "Baleba, who has three years left on his contract, is one of the most highly-rated youngsters in his position and has replaced Moises Caicedo in Brighton's midfield. It has been noted, however, that Brighton want to keep the Cameroon international for at least another year.",
      "There has been some speculation coming out of Africa that Brighton have agreed to let Baleba depart if the price is substantial.",

      "Alejandro Garnacho, Antony, Jadon Sancho and Tyrell Malacia are all available for an exit this summer, while the club would be open to other departures as well, with Rasmus Hojlund one name the club could allow to leave. Significant sales would drastically increase the budget for United to swoop in for Baleba.",

      "Barcelona have been struck by Marcus Rashford fever ever since the Englishman completed his loan transfer from Manchester United this summer.",
      "This summer, Rashford has sealed a season-long loan to Barcelona that has seen United save £12m in wages and could later earn them a reported £26m if the option to make the switch permanent is taken up.",
      "The 27-year-old has gone on to make three pre-season appearances for Hansi Flick's side, most recently scoring for the first time in Blaugrana colours in a friendly against South Koeran outfit Daegu.",
      "So far, it has been a positive start to life in Spain for Rashford and the forward will be hoping he can carry his form so far into the season.",
      "Rashford reportedly saw Barcelona as his dream club once it was clear he would be leaving United, and so far the love appears to be mutual.",
      "The club have now issued a three-word verdict of their new loan signing on Instagram as they posted an image of Rashford in action. The photograph was accompanied by the caption: \"Marcus Rashford: Born to score. [Heart on fire emoji].\"",
      "This is just the latest in a long line of social media activity centred on Rashford's second loan spell away from United, with a number of his Old Trafford teammates supporting their friend.",

      "They are said to be confident of finding common ground, and their next offer is reputedly worth over £40million. However, serious consideration is now purportedly being given to alternatives by the club so they are not caught out.",
      "La Gazetta dello Sport claims Inter are starting their search with Christopher Nkunku, but his former Chelsea teammate, Sancho, is reportedly the name gaining most traction. The report highlights that the winger would cost significantly less than Lookman or Nkunku, describing his £22million transfer fee as 'low'.",
      "Securing such a fee for Sancho would be a welcome boost and help offset any outlay on Benjamin Sesko. At one stage Juventus seemed the likeliest destination for the United outcast.",
      "However, their general director Damien Comolli recently claimed they \"have two of the best wingers in the world in [Kenan] Yildiz and [Francisco] Conceicao, plus Nico [Gonzalez] who's an excellent player. If anyone leaves, we'll be ready for the transfer market.\"",
      "Borussia Dortmund are another club credited with an interest in the player they have signed twice before. Their sporting director, Sebastian Kehl, recently acknowledged to Sky Sport Deutschland, \"[Jadon] is constantly being linked with us.",

      "\"The conditions have to be right. We will definitely do something, but we're limited.\"",

However, there's hope that Sesko is eager to join Ruben Amorim's squad as they aim to bounce back from a disastrous 2024/25 season under the former Sporting head coach.",
      "Leipzig, meanwhile, confirmed on Wednesday that the 22-year-old is continuing training alone as he looks to resolve his future. The Slovenian has taken a very different approach to some of the other big-name strikers when they have been surrounded by transfer speculation - providing Amorim with positive signs.",
      "Former Reds-linked Viktor Gyokeres went on strike at Sporting amid a dispute over the transfer fee he was permitted to depart for. The former Coventry City forward eventually joined Premier League rivals Arsenal.",

But Sesko's approach to sealing a summer exit has been very different to both players as he continues to train at his club.",
      "And Amorim's recent comments suggest that United have completed thorough checks on his character before accelerating their interest. It comes after previous claims that the Reds have faced attitude problems, fallouts and dressing room leaks with their squad.",

      "That meant Al-Hammadi became the first goalkeeper to keep out the opposition at Everton's new stadium. He shared photos of himself in action at the 52,888-capacity arena with the caption: “Grateful for every opportunity.”",
      "Al-Hammadi previously played for United Arab Emirates Pro League side Al Wasl. The young stopper has captained UAE Under-18s, but now appears to be exploring opportunities in Britain.",
      "United could offer Al-Hammadi a deal if his trial period is successful. The signing of Graczyk on a free transfer from Arsenal went slightly under the radar last summer, but he spent just a season in Manchester.",
      "Graczyk was named in two Premier League squads against Everton and Ipswich Town last term.",
      "The former Arsenal stopper also made a handful of appearances for the U21s.",

      "Manchester United's pursuit of Benjamin Sesko is indicative of a club whose number one transfer priority this summer is to sign a new centre-forward.",
      "Only four teams scored less goals in the Premier League last season but Amorim has made sure that issue has been addressed this summer.",
      "A new centre-forward will be complemented by the signings of Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo, who scored 37 goals between them last season, and that should relieve some of their goalscoring woes.",
      "Understandably United's focus has been on securing a proven goalscorer up front but once that situation is resolved, Ruben Amorim has already made United's next transfer priority pretty clear.",
      "Amorim is keen for United to sign a dynamic midfielder who offers a bit more pace in United's engine room. Captain Bruno Fernandes is expected to play deeper this season while Manuel Ugarte and Kobbie Mainoo are options in there too.",
      "But after the departure of Christian Eriksen, Toby Collyer, who is expected to leave United on loan this summer, is currently United's fourth option and it feels like that is a glaring area for improvement in the squad.",
      "But given the focus has been on signing attacking talent, there has been little in the way of links with midfielders so far.",
      "Valencia star Javi Guerra has been tentatively linked. So, too, has Sporting midfielder Morten Hjulmand who has, of course, worked under the United manager in Portugal.",
      "Whatever route United go down, the midfield situation is definitely one to watch between now and the end of the transfer window.",

      "Pre-season is all about experimenting and Ruben Amorim did plenty of that during Manchester United's tour of the United States.",
      "United brought a successful tour to a close with a 2-2 draw against Everton in Atlanta on Sunday night, ensuring they won the Premier League Summer Series.",
      "United's tour of the US consisted of three games, two wins, one draw and eight goals. Their performances in the wins over West Ham United and Bournemouth were particularly impressive.",
      "With just one friendly to go - a clash with Fiorentina at Old Trafford on Saturday lunchtime - head coach Ruben Amorim will potentially use his side's final warm up match to get a good look at the starting XI he plans to unleash for the season opener against Arsenal in just under a fortnight's time.",
      "Over the course of United's opening four pre-season friendlies, the first of which was a goalless draw against Leeds United in Stockholm last month, Amorim made 18 changes to his starting XI, ensuring he got the opportunity to get as close a look as possible at the members of his squad.",
      "However, Amorim has not tested the water with many midfield combinations this summer, starting just two different central-midfield partnerships. Bruno Fernandes and Casemiro started side by side against Leeds and Bournemouth, while Kobbie Mainoo and Manuel Ugarte got the nod against West Ham and Everton.",
      "Against the Hammers, Mainoo and Ugarte were excellent, producing performances that would not have looked out of place in a competitive fixture. United set an excellent tempo and the pair of them were drivers of it.",
      "Against Everton, though, United were sloppy in the engine room. They struggled against the Toffees' physicality levels and Ugarte was guilty of giving the ball away far too cheaply for Iliman Ndiaye's first half equaliser.",
      "Concerns about Ugarte's ability on the ball have regularly been expressed in recent months amid United's desire to sign a new midfielder this summer. As solid as he is defensively, his ability on the ball holds him back.",
      "Mainoo, whose long-term position under Amorim remains undecided, has looked at home as a No.8 for the majority of pre-season, playing forward-thinking passes and offering United a degree of energy.",
      "However, the additions of Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha mean they are leading candidates to start the season as the two No.10s, meaning Fernandes, despite starting two games as one of the playmakers, is expected to make a permanent switch to midfield.",
      "If that expectation transpires, it is currently a wide open race to partner him in the engine room. Casemiro has been his midfield partner in the two games he has started deeper this summer, but the Brazilian is not guaranteed to remain a regular starter once the competitive action kicks off.",
      "Many United supporters believe Mainoo should, one way or another, be in Amorim's first-choice starting XI, ensuring the Portuguese head coach finds a way to make full use of his talent. However, the fact he and Fernandes have not played alongside each other in midfield at any point so far this pre-season suggests Amorim is not thinking about unleashing them as a midfield duo.",
      "Amid the debate that is going on about who will form United's strongest midfield partnership this season, concerns have understandably been raised about how little bite and defensive nous a duo of Mainoo and Fernandes would have.",
      "Both players are renowned for being forward-thinking, and Fernandes will be expected to take up attacking positions, leaving Mainoo potentially exposed.",
      "United need to source a new midfielder ahead of the transfer window closing on September 1, and they are expected to do so amid the likelihood of Toby Collyer being allowed to leave on loan.",
      "In an ideal world, United need a midfielder who is aggressive, good on the ball and defensively sound. However, ticking all of those boxes will come at a price.",
      "But having refused to unleash Fernandes and Mainoo as a paring so far this pre-season, it feels somewhat unlikely Amorim will turn to them come the start of the competitive action.",
      "The countdown is on to the 2025/26 Premier League campaign - and our pre-season guide is the ideal way to prepare for the action ahead.",

      "Manchester United know what they have to do to complete a deal that could lead to them being taken somewhat seriously again. And Liverpool may or may not want a PSG striker…",
      "With so much transfer talk doing the rounds, we’re here through the summer to sift through the bullsh*t and highlight the whispers that might have some substance.",
      "Each day we’re ranking the top 20 rumours involving Premier League clubs, the higher the link, the more likely we feel they are to become done deals.",
      "So we start with the tittle-tattle…",
      "",
      "20) 🔽 Benjamin Sesko – RB Leipzig to Newcastle\nIt looks like Newcastle are about to take another gargantuan L but when you’re rivalling Man Utd, there’s always hope they will screw up until it’s signed and sealed.",
      "",
      "19) Rodrygo – Real Madrid to Arsenal\nThe Brazil winger is being linked with Liverpool too but no-one’s heart is really in it – yet. We get the sense that Arsenal and Liverpool would be happy to take him, and Real Madrid would be willing to sell, but finding common ground over a price might be tricky. And the player seems to want to stay. If anything happens around Rodrygo, it feels like a late one. Arsenal certainly need a winger and Liverpool want another attacker if Nunez leaves.",
      "",
      "18) 🆕 Ollie Watkins – Aston Villa to Newcastle\nHaving missed out on Sesko, it makes sense that Newcastle would switch to Man Utd’s alternative target, especially now Villa are closing a deal for a new striker of their own. Newcastle’s problem now, though, is that Villa know how much they were prepared to pay for Sesko. So, if it happens, it will be on Villa’s terms.",

      "17) 🆕 Bradley Barcola – PSG to Liverpool\nReports in France suggest Barcola is being considered as an alternative to Alexander Isak now that Darwin Nunez is on his way. But there are also suggestions that the Reds are not on the 23-year-old’s tail so we very much doubt this is a go-er. Nunez will be replaced, though.",
      "",
      "16)  Jadon Sancho – Manchester United to Anyone\nIt was reported ages ago that an agreement had been reached with Juventus but nothing happened. Then Dortmund started sniffing again but still nothing happens. This will almost certainly go the way we expected it to: a loan move, late in the window when United get desperate to shift Sancho’s salary. At least they banked £5million when Chelsea decided they would prefer to pay to not sign him.",
      "MORE: Ten-striker transfer domino starts with Sesko to Newcastle and ends with Wissa via Isak to Liverpool",
      "15) 🆕 Marc Guehi – Crystal Palace to Newcastle\nThe story goes that Newcastle are back in for the England defender after a failed pursuit last summer. Now he’s in the final year of his Palace contract, Guehi is available for £40m but Liverpool remain his preferred destination.",
      "",
      "14) 🔼 Alejandro Garnacho – Manchester United to Chelsea\nThere are no negotiations between United and Chelsea but the winger is giving his ‘full priority’ to the Club World Cup winners. The Blues have already signed Jamie Gittens this summer and are working on a deal for Xavi Simons. It doesn’t feel like they need Garnacho, but they’ve not required half the players they’ve signed in the Clearlake era. Poor Tyrique George knows he doesn’t stand a chance and has asked to leave. This club, man…",
      "",
      "13) Yoane Wissa – Brentford to Newcastle\nEveryone seems to be turning down Newcastle recently, but Wissa is one player who does want to join the Magpies. Strongly enough to go up against Brentford while they rebuff the Toon’s interest. At least until the offers reach around £40million. Brentford want that to lose another of their top players and they can see the desperation dripping off Newcastle.",
      "",
      "12) Eberechi Eze – Crystal Palace to Arsenal\nEze is the Gunners’ next top target after landing Viktor Gyokeres. And the England star has, apparently, been telling his mates he’s moving to the Emirates, but Arsenal are yet to deliver on Palace’s clear demand for his £68million buy-out clause to be met. Andrea Berta will doubtless spend weeks haggling over the number of instalments and Arsenal could really do with selling to make room in the squad and on the books for Eze.",
      "",
      "11) 🆕 Carlos Baleba – Brighton to Manchester United\nOoh. Baleba would make United a very passable football team. It emerged on Wednesday evening that the Red Devils had reached out to Brighton via intermediaries to suss the midfielder’s situation. Word hadn’t reached Brighton chief-exec Paul Barber by that point but it seems that the Seagulls would want something like £100million including add-ons, while United would open at £70million. That’s a big gap to bridge, especially when United don’t do this well and they are dealing with Brighton as reluctant sellers. Baleba, though, is keen to hear what United have to offer and his signing would be a bigger statement of intent than Sesko.",
      "",
      "10) Alexander Isak – Newcastle to Liverpool\nLiverpool’s first bid for Isak was made on Friday and very swiftly rejected by Newcastle. It was so emphatically rejected, in fact, that the champions reportedly won’t make a second bid. That leaves Isak in a very sticky situation, having burned plenty of bridges in the north east. But we doubt this is dead yet.",
      "RANKING: Isak crashes into best available strikers ranking as Liverpool eye £130m Newcastle rebel",
      "",
      "9) 🆕 Jack Grealish – Manchester City to Everton\nEverton want to give Grealish the get-out he needs from City but the Toffees will have to haggle hard over who pays the bulk of the winger’s wages since he currently earns well over double that of their highest earner. We want to see the old Grealish back and that could happen at Everton.",
      "",
      "8) 🆕 Harvey Elliott – Liverpool to RB Leipzig\nElliott needs to leave Anfield for more regular playing time, and Leipzig would offer that to him, as a replacement for…",
      "",
      "7) Xavi Simons – RB Leipzig to Chelsea\nA Chelsea move appeals to Simons and the Blues are keen to make it happen. But they will look for a hefty discount on the £56million RB Leipzig are demanding for the one-time Arsenal target. Banking £20million for Broja will help.",
      "",
      "6) 🔼 Tyler Dibling – Southampton to Everton\nDavid Moyes has voiced his concerns about the Toffees’ lack of transfer activity, and his bosses have taken note. Dibling is reportedly the subject of a £40m offer, but the Saints want more. Dibling has been withdrawn from some aspects of training, though, so a deal cannot be far off.",
      "",
      "5) 🔼 John Victor – Botafogo to West Ham\nThere is a ‘verbal agreement’ for Big John to join the Hammers. No, not the guy from The Inbetweeners. Though with West Ham, you never can be sure. The Brazilian will by vying for Alphonse Areola’s No.1 spot…",
      "",
      "4) 🔼 Darwin Nunez – Liverpool to Al-Hilal\nA deal has been agreed with Al-Hilal to take Nunez to Saudi for £56million. PIF paying Liverpool big money – over the odds? –  so they can buy Alexander Isak is quite the situation. Given Nunez was so keen to remain in Europe, this one could have a twist yet.",
      "",
      "3) 🔼 Benjamin Sesko – RB Leipzig to Manchester United\nWe await confirmation but all the whispers suggest Sesko has chosen United over Newcastle after both clubs submitted their offers to RB Leipzig. It looks like a win for United but we remain to be convinced…",
      "F365 SAYS: Manchester United brief over striker shortlist and transfer ‘process’ makes them look foolish yet again",
      "2) Armando Broja and Lesley Ugochukwu – Chelsea to Burnley\nLesley Ugochukwu is done, now we wait for Broja to follow him up from west London. Rumours are that Chelsea will bank £20million for Broja. Far less than the £50million he was once valued but still more than he’s worth.",
      "",
      "1) 🆕 Evann Guessand – Nice to Aston Villa\nThe Villans have been linked quite a bit but an agreement with Nice came out of nowhere in the end. The Nice striker was in the Midlands on Wednesday for a medical will join for £30.5m, which could open the door for Watkins to depart."

      "“This deal is very difficult. Baleba is a top player for Brighton, a crucial player. Brighton want him to stay and don’t want to lose him. To sign a player from Brighton with 23-24 days to go before the end of the window is not easy. The price will be very high, so it’s a very complicated deal.",

      "Manchester United have decided that Benjamin Sesko for £74million makes more sense than Ollie Watkins for £50million.",
      "As This Is Manchester United Football Club We’re Talking About, we have our doubts.",
      "The overriding argument for Watkins is pretty compelling in our eyes: guaranteed goals. That is something United have notoriously lacked in recent seasons. They re-signed Cristiano Ronaldo in 2021 and he provided that for a year under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and Ralf Rangnick. He scored 24 goals in 38 games after Edinson Cavani bagged 17 in 39 the season before.",
      "Since their successful — albeit short-term — goalscoring exploits, United changed their striker recruitment philosophy to guys for the future. And how has that gone so far? Well…",
      "Rasmus Hojlund for £68million has been nothing short of a disaster. He needed 15 games to score his first Premier League goal, which did lead to a purple patch before an injury halted his goalscoring streak. Three in his last nine top-flight games of the season at least hinted he could pick up where he left off in 2024/25.",
      "He absolutely did not. The 22-year-old Dane registered four goals and zero assists in the Premier League last season. Joshua Zirkzee was even signed to unload some of the centre-forward burden, which didn’t help.",
      "Zirkzee was another inexperienced forward with no Premier League experience brought in by the club last summer. And just like with Hojlund, it’s proving to be a poor investment. Both players are young and can easily improve — even potentially become world-class — but these two case studies should be enough proof for United that no matter how appealing the prospect of signing Sesko is, they should have resisted the urge and gone all in on Watkins.",
      "There is an argument for why that’s not the direction United should have taken — and we’ll get to that — but how Sir Jim Ratcliffe and his transfer team haven’t used the Hojlund and Zirkzee evidence to ensure they don’t make the same mistake is startling. Ronaldo and Cavani are important here as well. The former was signed when he was 36 and Cavani was 33. Yet they were reliable options in front of goal, something Hojlund and Zirkzee have failed to become.",
      "Ronaldo and Cavani are not the only strikers older than Watkins (29) signed by the Red Devils who thrived at Old Trafford. There’s also Zlatan Ibrahimovic — the club’s second-best post-Sir Alex Ferguson signing — Robin van Persie, and, a long time ago, Teddy Sheringham.",
      "The fact Watkins turns 30 in December means absolutely nothing in a footballing sense. Players keep themselves in the sort of shape these days that means he could still be flying for United six years from now. But, no. In classic United fashion, they’ve gone for the flashy new toy — whose upside is huge, we know — but who also has an incredible, potentially Hojlund-esque downside.",

      "The main issue with Watkins appears to be his resale value. In that respect, the best-case scenario is that Watkins performs at a high level for a few years and Saudi Arabia come calling with a huge offer that the player wants to pursue. The worst-case scenario is that he’s pants from day one and United are stuck with another high-earning, underperforming, big-money flop. Having watched Watkins in the Premier League for the last five years, that is very unlikely. And yes, so unlikely that we are completely writing it off, which we haven’t done with the prospect of Sesko being another Hojlund (or only a little bit better).",
      "‘Resale value’ can be disregarded when the player pays you back on the pitch, and that’s what Watkins would do at Old Trafford. His worst Premier League goal return came in 2021/22, when he scored 11. That was also the only season Watkins missed more than one game across a top-flight campaign. He played 38 out of 38 last term!",
      "It’s a Manchester United decision that’s just…very Manchester United, but there is some logic to it.",
      "United’s transfer philosophy changes every summer, and the mood this year is to only sign players who really want to play for the club. Sesko fits the bill, while Watkins wasn’t aggressively pushing for the move. That’s the biggest factor for United, we think.",
      "And then there were the selling clubs. Everything we said about Watkins could be worth nothing if Aston Villa have zero intention to sell the player. RB Leipzig, on the other hand, have every intention to sell Sesko — but it was always going to happen on their terms.",
      "MORE: Ollie Watkins or Benjamin Sesko: Which striker should Man Utd sign?",
      "Arsenal reportedly preferred Sesko to new signing Viktor Gyokeres but were put off by the German club’s whopping valuation of the 22-year-old Slovenian: 90 million euros.",
      "That’s around £78.5m, and it’s what Newcastle United offered Leipzig for the player. United, knowing he only wanted them, went a little under that — offering £74m. Reports suggest that offer has already been increased to match the Magpies’, such is the Red Devils’ desire to get Sesko through the door and ready for their Premier League opener against Arsenal.",
      "The fact Leipzig are open to negotiations, and most importantly, Sesko is desperate to join, holds more weight in the United boardroom than a guaranteed success in Watkins — even if that’s what Ruben Amorim’s side are desperately crying out for.",
      "And we might be blinded by Hojlund and Zirkzee’s performances. They don’t necessarily mean that every young attacker signed by United will turn out rubbish — even if nearly all of their major signings over the last 12 years have been just that. The trend has to break at some point. Sesko certainly has the potential and current ability to be the trend-breaker.",
      "Still, the overriding point from us remains: Who is more likely to get United back in the top five? Watkins, for me, Clive. And that’s the bottom line.",

      "Manchester United star Rasmus Hojlund is now ‘resigned’ to the Old Trafford exit while the Red Devils make ‘exactly’ the same mistake with Benjamin Sesko.",
      "The RB Leipzig striker looks set to snub Newcastle for Man Utd this summer, according to The Athletic’s David Ornstein:",
      "‘Newcastle initially tabled €75million plus €5m in add-ons, before raising that on Monday to at least €80m. Within 24 hours, Manchester United made a proposal of their own worth €75m plus €10m.",
      "‘Newcastle have continued working to secure the transfer and on Tuesday a bid of €82.5m plus €2.5m was accepted by Leipzig. But Sesko wants to join Manchester United and all parties are now aware of that, as talks advance in an effort to satisfy Leipzig’s expectations. While there is no club-to-club agreement yet, the situation is moving in that direction.’",
      "United’s push to sign a new No.9 has put Hojlund’s future at the club in doubt, with the club bosses now said to be more than open to his sale.",
      "After scoring in the pre-season win over Bournemouth last week, Hojlund said: “I think the most important thing for me is just to keep working hard and stay focused, and then obviously we’ll see what happens.”",
      "“I think my plan is very clear, and that is for me to stay and fight for my spot, whatever happens. I’m still very young. I think people forget that sometimes. I’m only 22.",
      "“Obviously, not every striker is scoring 100 goals at the age of 22 (like Erling Haaland). But I’ve learned a lot, I think you can see in my game. I’m starting to develop and become even better in the basics.",
      "“Now it’s just about for me to sharpen myself, and I’ve done very well in the pre-season so far. Just focusing on continuing that.”",
      "The report adds:",
      "‘Sources close to the Denmark international concede that if Hojlund is unwanted it could lift his game but, ultimately, he will have to seek a move before the transfer deadline on September 1.’",
      "Ex-Red Devils assistant Rene Meulensteen believes his former side should have instead pushed to sign Ollie Watkins.",
      "Meulensteen said: “Manchester United’s bid for Benjamin Sesko is basically exactly what they did with Rasmus Hojlund. If he scores in the first three or four games and hits the ground running then he could be the answer for the club, but there’s a chance that won’t happen.",
      "“If you look at Hojlund, he joined Atalanta and performed well alongside the rest of the team and then joined United.  The same can be said for Sesko – the Bundesliga is a very different league to the Premier League, so he’ll need to adapt. Has Sesko got potential? 100%, but he’s still young and developing and he isn’t the finished article.”",

      "Including three Manchester United outcasts and several Arsenal targets, these are the 10 best wide forwards available in the 2025 summer transfer window.",
      "And here are the best available strikers. And attacking midfielders. Oh, and centre-backs. Plus defensive midfielders.",
      "10) Jadon Sancho (Manchester United)\nManchester United need to sell Sancho and he certainly is an available winger. Juventus have been linked with a while but it’s all very quiet regarding the ex-Borussia Dortmund man’s future.",
      "",
      "9) Antony (Manchester United)\nThe Red Devils have managed to offload Marcus Rashford, who dropped out of this ranking after agreeing a move to Barcelona.",
      "Antony impressed during a productive loan spell at Real Betis in the second half of last season. The Spanish club want him permanently, and the Brazilian is keen on the move. They’re a great fit.",
      "",
      "8) Alejandro Garnacho (Manchester United)\nWe are three for three for United players on the chopping block. Garnacho is reportedly valued at a staggering £60million — a figure that feels wildly inflated for a player who underperformed last season and comes with baggage. But at just 21 years old, he still holds plenty of promise.",
      "Garnacho wasn’t alone in struggling at Old Trafford; very few besides Bruno Fernandes stood out. But unless Sir Jim Ratcliffe lowers his valuation, United might be forced to keep or loan him out, risking a repeat of this summer’s dilemma in 2026.",
      "",
      "7) Maghnes Akliouche (AS Monaco)\nThe 23-year-old had a solid campaign with Monaco, regiestering five goals and 10 assists in Ligue 1. He’s earned six caps for France, which is no small feat, and was recently linked with a move to Arsenal. That interest seems to have cooled after the Gunners picked up Noni Madueke.",
      "Still, Akliouche is available…for a steep £70million. He’s not cheap, but he’s fantastic.",
      "",
      "6) Jack Grealish (Manchester City)\nThere are younger options like Tyler Dibling, while Gabriel Martinelli’s availability is up for debate (that’s the honourable mentions out of the way), but we reckon Jack Grealish just edges them. Why? SEO, maybe. But also because he’s a Premier League-proven talent who, under the right manager, can still be one of the most dangerous wingers in Europe.",
      "We’re not sure if Grealish is the type of player who lacks confidence, but what we do know is that the freedom and eccentricity he once oozed have been stripped away under Pep Guardiola. He was so exciting to watch at Aston Villa, prompting Man City to break the British transfer record to sign him, only to reinvent him as a risk-averse wide-midfielder who keeps the ball safe at all costs. Jeremy Doku, by contrast, has been given a free pass to run at full-backs like it’s a playground kickabout.",
      "Someone needs to get us the old Grealish back. We miss him dearly.",
      "",
      "5) Takefusa Kubo (Real Sociedad)\nThere’s a £50.2million release clause in Kubo’s contract, with Real Madrid due 50% of any sale — meaning they could bring him back for a bargain £25m if they wanted. But Los Blancos already have more attacking depth than they know what to do with. Arda Guler and Brahim Diaz barely get a look-in as it is.",
      "Kubo was one of Europe’s top take-on artists in 2024/25, even if five goals and zero assists in 36 La Liga games is underwhelming. Still, Alexander Isak only got six in his final season at Sociedad, and he’s done alright since.",
      "The Japanese winger is a menace in possession, with progressive carry and foul-winning numbers that compare well with Mo Salah, Raphinha, Lamine Yamal and Vinicius Jr. He’s also one of the best defensive workers among that group. There’s a serious Premier League player in there.",
      "",
      "4) Malick Fofana (Lyon)\nLyon might be safe from relegation, but they’re still resigned to losing Belgian winger Fofana this summer. Saying that, there’s no immediate rush on Fofana’s part to leave.",
      "Nottingham Forest had a bid accepted and sold Anthony Elanga to Newcastle United for £55million, but Fofana wants Champions League football. Chelsea are an option but have already signed Liam Delap, Jamie Gittens and Joao Pedro.",
      "What is clear is that, at just 20 years old, he is one of the most intriguing prospects on the market this summer.",
      "",
      "3) Nico Williams (Athletic Club)\nWilliams has signed a new long-term contract at Bilbao, but the release clause still exists. Oh, and by ‘long-term’, we mean 10 f***ing years.",
      "",
      "2) Rafael Leao (AC Milan)\nIt feels like time for Leao to leave Milan. Chelsea are probably out — they’ve welcomed Gittens, Estevao and Kendry Paez this summer — but Arsenal’s need for a left-winger is glaring. How did they let Khvicha Kvaratskhelia go to PSG without a fight in January?",
      "With Grealish likely off and Jeremy Doku not fully convincing, Man City could come calling too. Liverpool would also make sense if they don’t sign Alexander Isak.",
      "Leao’s performance in the Nations League final for Portugal would have convinced a few potential suitors.",
      "",
      "1) Rodrygo (Real Madrid)\nIf Arsenal sign Rodrygo, it would have real Alexis Sanchez vibes. A genuine elite winger, an X-factor star, and the sort of player who deserves to be more than a supporting act. Even after signing Madueke from Chelsea, we shouldn’t rule the Gunners out.",
      "Real Madrid are all about Kylian Mbappe, Jude Bellingham and Vinicius Jr now. Rodrygo, despite being a proven match-winner with two Champions Leagues and three La Liga titles, is expendable.",
      "He should be one of the poster boys at a top club — and most English sides can offer him that. He might just be the best player available this summer.",
      "READ NOW: How Andrea Berta should spend his £300m to win Arsenal the Premier League title",

      "Surely, even in big 2025, we can’t go around saying that West Ham missing out on a deal is Liverpool missing out on a deal? Even if everyone cares about the latter and only a surprisingly high proportion of national newspaper journalists care about the latter?",
      "And even if we are allowing this absolute p*ss-take to stand, how is missing out on signing one player missing out on a ‘double deal’?",
      "Whoa, there. Be patient, please. The Express are getting to that. Eventually. Several rambling paragraphs about actual Liverpool transfer deals later.",
      "It is claimed that the Hammers were plotting a double deal which would have seen Morton and Harvey Elliott join their side, but they will now have to rethink that plan.",
      "Right, so that Elliott deal is scuppered as well, is it? Kind of an all-or-nothing arrangement, yeah? Seems odd, but okay… oh, you weren’t done.",
      "It remains to be seen whether West Ham continue to push for Elliott nevertheless, with the playmaker facing an uncertain future on Merseyside after struggling for minutes under Slot last season.",
      "So a headline that tells us Liverpool have missed out on a double deal sits above a story about West Ham missing out on a single deal. Thanks, we hate it.",

      "Harry’s game\nWhile pretty much everyone else understandably leads on Benjamin Sesko and the possible knock-on effects of that Newcastle-Man United tangle for Liverpool’s pursuit of Alexander Isak, the Daily Express have gone – as they so often do – another way.",

      "Man Utd hit by Harry Maguire bidding war as ‘five clubs make offers’ for defender",
      "Very clear this is framed as bad news for Man United, who have been ‘hit’ by this ‘bidding war’ for a player they don’t have any desire to sell this summer. They’ve knocked back these five offers, but how much longer can they continue to repel these advances?",
      "Probably all summer, given this fairly significant piece of information buried deep, deep down.",
      "However, despite the growing interest, Maguire remains happy at the Theatre of Dreams and is likely to extend his contract at the club and play out the remainder of his career with United. The defender hopes to ‘emulate’ Red Devils legends like Steve Bruce and Bryan Robson by putting faith in the club and guiding them back to their glory days.",
      "We’re not saying there’s no story here at all, and Maguire’s elevated status at a club where he appeared to have no future not so long ago is a tale worth telling, but ‘club receive bids for player they won’t sell and who doesn’t want to leave’ is an odd choice for top story at a time when there are genuine transfer sagas progressing significantly that impact United themselves and other large Premier League clubs.",
      "",
      "Eze does it\nElsewhere in Transfer Land, Arsenal’s pursuit of Crystal Palace’s Eberechi Eze continues. We say pursuit, but it really barely qualifies as that with every report on the saga grudgingly forced to include a line somewhere around the 13th paragraph admitting there hasn’t actually been a bid yet.",
      "But that doesn’t mean nothing is happening. Oh no. The Daily Star bring us this nugget.",
      "Arsenal transfer news: Eberechi Eze’s position clear as £26m switch falls through",

      "Man Utd are buying another Rasmus Hojlund this summer as Benjamin Sesko will “need to adapt” to the Premier League, according to former Red Devils assistant manager Rene Meulensteen.",
      "The Red Devils have won the race to sign Sesko from RB Leipzig with The Athletic‘s David Ornstein revealing on Wednesday that Man Utd are beating Newcastle and ‘closing in’ on a deal to sign the Slovenian.",
      "Transfer expert Fabrizio Romano has since revealed that Man Utd have secured a ‘total agreement’ over personal terms after Sesko made it clear he would rather join the Red Devils than Newcastle.",
      "But Meulensteen thinks he’s seen this play out before with Hojlund, who also has big potential, disappointing for two seasons after signing for £72m from Atalanta in 2023.",
      "Meulensteen told Poker Strategy: “Manchester United’s bid for Benjamin Sesko is basically exactly what they did with Rasmus Hojlund. If he scores in the first three or four games and hits the ground running then he could be the answer for the club, but there’s a chance that won’t happen.",
      "“If you look at Hojlund, he joined Atalanta and performed well alongside the rest of the team and then joined United.  The same can be said for Sesko – the Bundesliga is a very different league to the Premier League, so he’ll need to adapt. Has Sesko got potential? 100%, but he’s still young and developing and he isn’t the finished article.”",
      "READ: One priority position per Premier League club: Arsenal winger, Man Utd striker, Liverpool centre-back",
      "Meulensteen added: “I look at someone like Ollie Watkins who may be available. He’s a hard-working player with similar features to Sesko, except that he already has Premier League experience which is priceless. I think Sesko would probably cost more than Watkins too.",
      "“Why doesn’t the club bring in Watkins and allow the coaches to work closely with Hojlund to allow him to develop? It’s a waste of an investment otherwise – they paid close to £80m for him and they’re in danger of selling him for less than half of that unless he develops.”",
      "Earlier this year, Man Utd co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe claimed that the Red Devils would have gone “bust at Christmas” without the cost-saving measures he put in place.",
      "But deals for Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo cost a combined £127.5m, while the package on the table for Sesko is reportedly worth around £74m.",
      "And football finance expert Stefan Borson reckons Ratcliffe painted “a slightly exaggerated picture” earlier this year.",
      "Borson told Football Insider: “Manchester United are in the same position as City, Chelsea and a number of clubs in terms of wanting to sell off some of their dead wood.",
      "“We know about Sancho, Antony, they haven’t sold Rashford, but he’s gone on loan.",
      "“They have not brought in the cash that they would have expected to so far, and that is a challenge, but they seem to be keen to continue the spending.",
      "“The cash problems and financial problems that Ratcliffe talked about in February seem to have dissipated despite a whole succession of things going against them from a budgeting perspective.",
      "“Everything seems to have gone worse since he gave that interview with various people, so I’m not sure why they now feel more comfortable spending, or whether there was maybe a slightly exaggerated picture painted in February.”",

      "Newcastle and Manchester United have both made bids for RB Leipzig striker Benjamin Sesko; Slovenia international has impressed in Germany and drawn style and stature comparisons with Manchester City's Erling Haaland",
      "Tuesday 5 August 2025 17:47, UK",
      "Newcastle, Manchester United and Arsenal have all shown an interest in signing Benjamin Sesko this summer - but what makes the RB Leipzig striker so appealing?",
      "Arsenal's interest is over after they opted to sign Viktor Gyokeres from Sporting CP but Newcastle and Manchester United have both lodged bids in the region of £70m.",
      "Sesko has scored 39 goals in 87 games for RB Leipzig since joining from Red Bull Salzburg two years ago but what qualities would the 22-year-old bring to the Premier League?",
      "And could he really be the next Erling Haaland?",
      "His scoring record is modest by comparison but Sesko is a rare breed of striker with a similar physical profile to Haaland. At 6ft 4in, he is exactly the same height and similarly quick.",
      "His stature allows him to play the role of a targetman, holding the ball up, bringing team-mates into play and providing an outlet for long passes, crosses and set-piece deliveries.",
      "Like Haaland, he combines those qualities with explosive pace.",
      "Last season in the Bundesliga, Sesko's top speed of 35.69 km/h put him 26th among 492 players to feature in the competition. He ranked even higher in the previous campaign, at 15th.",
      "His pace no doubt forms a significant part of his appeal to Newcastle as they face the prospect of having to replace Alexander Isak, and to Manchester United as they look to add more explosiveness to their attack following the signing of Bryan Mbeumo from Brentford.",
      "Sesko's speed can stretch and destabilise defences. It is also a devastating weapon on the break and on transitions, something he has demonstrated throughout his time in Germany.",
      "RB Leipzig are known as one of the country's most effective counter-attacking teams - their total of 17 counter-attack goals since the start of last season is the second-highest among Bundesliga sides, behind only Eintracht Frankfurt - and Sesko has been a big part of it.",
      "His total of five fast-break goals across the last two Bundesliga seasons puts him third in the division, behind his RB Leipzig team-mate Lois Openda and former Eintracht Frankfurt forward Omar Marmoush, who have scored six each.",
      "Sesko's most recent example came during a 3-3 draw with Bayern Munich in May, when he accelerated away from Eric Dier to latch onto a Xavi Simons pass and send a superb, first-time finish past stranded goalkeeper Jonas Urbig from long range.",
      "That attack saw the ball travel from the edge of RB Leipzig's box to the back of the Bayern Munich net in a matter of seconds and it was enabled by the speed and ruthless efficiency of Sesko.",
      "It is also worth noting that it is not just in open spaces that Sesko is able to carry the ball upfield.",
      "Unusually for a player of his stature, Sesko is also an accomplished dribbler with the technical skill to beat defenders in tight spaces before accelerating towards goal.",
      "His average of 1.46 successful take-ons per 90 minutes was in fact the highest of any out-and-out striker in the Bundesliga last season, highlighting another area of strength.",
      "Sesko's scoring rate dipped slightly as RB Leipzig endured a poor campaign last term but his penchant for the spectacular remains, thanks largely to his outstanding ball-striking ability.",
      "That opening goal against Bayern Munich in May, curled around Urbig using the outside of his boot from 40 yards out, was one of four he has scored from outside the box in the Bundesliga since the start of last season. Only a handful of players have scored more.",
      "Even fewer can claim to have found the net from distance with the same level of ferocity.",
      "Sesko is able to generate astonishing power with his shots, as seen most memorably with his stunning strike against Werder Bremen in January, rifled into the top corner from 25 yards out. The ball was later revealed to have travelled at a speed of 126.43 km/h.",
      "That goal against Werder Bremen, like the one against Bayern five months later, was hit with his stronger right foot but he can muster similar power using his weaker foot too.",
      "Playing for Slovenia in a Nations League game against Sweden in September 2022, he scored a sensational, left-footed volley which drew comparisons with Marco van Basten.",
      "Sesko's willingness to shoot from improbable angles and unlikely positions can, on the flip side, be frustrating. His shot map for the last two Bundesliga seasons shows a high percentage of his shots were statistically unlikely to result in goals.",
      "It is also worth noting he has significantly overperformed relative to his expected goals at RB Leipzig, scoring 27 times in the Bundesliga from only 17.7 xG across the last two seasons. The numbers raise questions over whether his scoring rate is sustainable.",
      "At the same time, though, knowing what he is capable of, it is easy to see the logic behind his ambitious shot choices. Sesko has shown he can score from just about anywhere. His directness is another part of his appeal.",
      "Another of Sesko's biggest attributes is his prodigious leap.",
      "He was a promising basketball player in his teens and the agility honed on the court can now be seen in the way he challenges for headers and controls high balls on the pitch.",
      "Coupled with his height, it gives him an edge in the opposition box, as seen when he leapt above the outstretched hand of Eintracht Frankfurt goalkeeper Kevin Trapp to head home a rebound before Trapp could reach it during a 2-1 win in December.",
      "That goal was one of eight Sesko has scored with his head across the last two Bundesliga seasons. It is the fourth-highest total in the competition behind Harry Kane, Serhou Guirassy and Tim Kleindienst, and underlines the extent of his aerial threat.",
      "That threat is particularly pertinent to Manchester United as they aim to increase their set-piece threat. They rank as the Premier League's lowest scorers from set-pieces over the last three seasons.",
      "Sesko is not yet the finished article having only turned 22 at the end of May. Some elements of his game are still raw. His goals tend to come in bursts rather than consistently.",
      "A move to the Premier League would come with considerable pressure and high expectations but his age ensures he has plenty of room to grow and develop.",
      "There is of course an element of risk in signing Sesko ahead of a more established option. He does not boast the same prolific scoring record as Haaland when he made the move to England. Haaland had scored 86 goals in 89 games for Borussia Dortmund whereas Sesko has scored 39 goals in 87 games for RB Leipzig.",
      "But his potential is huge and the parallels in style are clear. The pair have even followed similar routes, with Sesko effectively brought in as Haaland's replacement at former club Red Bull Salzburg.",
      "It is also worth noting that, at only 22, Sesko has already amassed considerable experience, making more than 250 appearances for club and country, featuring at Champions League level, and reaching double figures for goals in five consecutive campaigns.",
      "He has done all that while avoiding any serious injury setbacks. That durability is another factor in his favour, and another source of encouragement to Newcastle and Manchester United.",

      "Tuesday 5 August 2025 13:39, UK",
      "Newcastle have upped their bid for RB Leipzig striker Benjamin Sesko.",
      "It is understood Newcastle are now offering £69.7m (€80m) as a fixed fee plus add-ons for the Slovenia international.",
      "They have since been negotiating with Leipzig and have now raised their offer.",
      "Meanwhile, Manchester United are discussing internally the next steps regarding their interest in Sesko.",
      "United have not made an official bid and are aware of Newcastle's latest offer, but they intend to remain disciplined and will not get drawn into a bidding war",
      "Sesko is believed to be open to both projects, although one source has claimed he has been leaning towards United, if they can agree a deal with Leipzig.",
      "It is thought United would want a clear indication Sesko only wants to join them before making a formal bid.",
      "While United's focus has been on Sesko, he is not the only striker United are looking at.",
      "They have explored the conditions of a deal for several strikers, including Aston Villa's Ollie Watkins.",
      "United's pursuit of Sesko raises questions over Rasmus Hojlund's future at Old Trafford, with the club understood to be listening to suitable offers for the striker.",
      "It was thought United would have to make sales in order to bring in a striker. However, while the priority is to offload players, it is understood Ruben Amorim's side can buy before selling, provided there are sales before the window closes.",
      "It is understood Leipzig are interested in Hojlund and have explored the conditions of a loan. Leipzig had proposed taking the striker on loan as part of any possible deal for Sesko.",
      "Hojlund has started two of Man Utd's four pre-season games so far and scored in their 4-1 win over Bournemouth, but the possible arrival of a new striker could limit his game time.",
      "A scenario where Sesko joins and Hojlund stays cannot be ruled out.",
      "Sesko was absent from RB Leipzig's pre-season friendly loss to Atalanta on Saturday due to his expected departure from the club. The striker has told his team-mates that he will be leaving, according to Sky in Germany.",
      "Marcel Schafer, Leipzig's managing director for sport, confirmed clubs have made approaches for Sesko.",
      "\"We won't go into detail on that but when I say that several clubs have shown strong interest and have made approaches, it's obvious what has happened,\" he said.",
      "Newcastle are also interested in Yoane Wissa, who was not part of Brentford's squad for their friendly against QPR on Saturday as he pushes for a move.",
      "Newcastle head coach Eddie Howe said Newcastle are only \"looking for the best\" in terms of transfer targets amid a challenging window for the club.",
      "Not only have the Magpies been hit by Isak's desire to leave but they have also missed out on a number of transfer targets to rivals, including Liam Delap, Joao Pedro, Hugo Ekitike and James Trafford.",
      "Newcastle have also hit a roadblock in their pursuit of Wissa after having a £25m bid knocked back, although the Brentford striker wants to join the Magpies.",
      "With Callum Wilson joining West Ham, it leaves just Will Osula as their alternative to Alexander Isak at No 9.",
      "\"We're looking for the best players that we can get,\" said Howe. \"Whatever our target position is, we're looking for the best, so I see all situations open and available to us.",
      "\"I feel that's the only way that we're going to get to where we want to go, which is to maximise, and it's quality over quantity. It always has been. That's always been the way that we try to work and the way that we try to recruit, and I think we've done it pretty well to this point.",
      "\"It's been a challenging summer because we've missed out on various targets for loads of different reasons, but we're still very competitive and we're still in there trying to bring very good players to the club - and that won't change until the window shuts.\"",

      "Monday 4 August 2025 14:44, UK",
      "Manchester United and Everton played out an entertaining 2-2 draw in Atlanta as Ruben Amorim’s side won the Premier League Summer Series.",
      "In a game which featured a first Manchester United appearance for Bryan Mbeumo, their £71m signing from Brentford, Everton twice came from behind to claim their first point of the tournament.",
      "Bruno Fernandes' first-half penalty, following a foul by James Tarkowski on Amad Diallo, was cancelled out by Iliman Ndiaye, who finished emphatically from Idrissa Gueye's cross after Vitalii Mykolenko had robbed Manuel Ugarte.",
      "Substitute Mason Mount put Manchester United back in front when he turned and curled a superb finish beyond Jordan Pickford from Fernandes' pass, but Everton levelled again when Amad's attempted clearance struck Ayden Heaven and went into the net.",
      "The freakish own goal, which occurred as Fernandes kicked out at Ndiaye, who reacted by shoving him as both players were booked, denied Manchester United a third consecutive win at the Premier League Summer Series but they still finished as winners, a point ahead of West Ham in the four-team group.",
      "As in the previous games against West Ham and Bournemouth, there were positives for Amorim, particularly in the first half, when his side produced several slick attacks and Mbeumo combined smartly with Fernandes and fellow new signing Matheus Cunha.",
      "Mbeumo was replaced by Patrick Dorgu at half-time and the game lost its rhythm as both sides made changes in the second period, with new Everton signing Adam Aznou among those introduced.",
      "Manchester United had a late chance to win it when Mount played in Dorgu but the wing-back's diagonal shot was well saved by Pickford to round off a much-improved performance from Everton following their defeats to Bournemouth and West Ham.",
      "Bruno Fernandes said the Premier League Summer Series has helped bring Manchester United's players together but rued \"laziness\" in their performance against Everton.",
      "\"It's been important for developing how we want to play and getting the new players involved too.",
      "\"We didn't want to finish in this way. Our performance wasn't the best and we were a little bit lazy today.",
      "\"We want to avoid that because with laziness you can pay at any moment.\"",
      "On Manchester United's summer transfer activity, he added: \"I don't want to take a dig at anyone but the club is doing the best they can in terms of the financial situation they talk about.",
      "\"But it was crystal clear we needed more competition for the players that were here, more quality to get everyone to step up a little bit more, and I think that is what the club are trying to do.",
      "\"Hopefully we can get one or two players more to help with that.\"",
      "His first run in behind Everton's defence came inside the very first minute of the game. Soon afterwards, he was dropping deep to release Bruno Fernandes and launch an attack. Some time later, fans cheered as he dribbled out of danger in his own half.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo only played 45 minutes of Manchester United's 2-2 draw with Everton on Sunday but even in that short timeframe he offered plenty of evidence to show just how much he can bring to Ruben Amorim's attack following his £71m arrival from Brentford.",
      "The 25-year-old's early withdrawal showed there is work to do to build his fitness but he looked sharp, starting in an inside right position, behind Matheus Cunha, but interchanging roles with the Brazilian throughout the first half, his movement causing problems.",
      "He was involved in the build-up to the penalty, releasing Amad Diallo with an instinctive first-time pass, and went close to scoring himself, first when he tested Jordan Pickford from a free-kick, and again when he had two efforts in quick succession blocked.",
      "As became customary at Brentford, his speed and dynamism was a major feature of his performance. His forward runs provided a foil for Fernandes and there were early signs of chemistry with Amad and Cunha. All in all, this was a positive start by Manchester United's new No 19. He looks primed to make a big impact.",
      "Ruben Amorim was pleased with Bryan Mbeumo's first Manchester United appearance.",
      "\"He played well,\" he said. \"He needs to understand the position, the movements, but first his touch, the way he connected with one touch, opened a lot of space.",
      "\"You can see he's not in perfect condition, physically, but he makes a lot of runs and that can stretch a team.\"",

      "After a 15th-placed finish in the Premier League last season and defeat in the final of the Europa League to Tottenham, Fernandes also called on United to start to show a winning mentality again, and he challenged the players to show it on the pitch.",
